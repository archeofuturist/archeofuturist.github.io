He was sacrificed\/murdered by the Jews, but it was all part of God&#039;s plan. Many Kike&#039;s realised back then that he was the son of God and converted to follow Jesus.<br><br>Those who refused, who thought they knew better maintained their pigheadedness and thought they knew better than God. They know the truth in their hearts of hearts, but because their religion chose to follow Satan instead of God, they&#039;ve spend the last 2,000 years trying to justify, trying to hide their crime and playing the victims.<br><br>This is one of the reasons everybody persecutes the Jews - God is still punishing them for their folly. There will never be peace in the Middle East and Israel will never get respite until they accept Jesus IS the Messiah.","filename":"angelOfTheLord","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":695,"tn_w":230,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492130697392,"time":1492130697,"md5":"UNtJV2+mGp3QYGPgmQbU9A==","fsize":44858,"resto":0,"id":"QEn4zS36","country":"AU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"kike-propoganda-dont-be-fooled","country_name":"Australia","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

The sounds of society cannot reach me. I&#039;ll be surrounded by nothing but trees, bugs, flora, fauna, chirping birds, the open sky. I&#039;ll bring books. Lots of books. I&#039;ll read, tan, climb trees, chop em down, try to make a cabin like I said. Can&#039;t wait, desu. Just waiting for the middle of May and I&#039;ll be off.

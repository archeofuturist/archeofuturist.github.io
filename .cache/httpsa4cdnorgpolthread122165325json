Now you have to understand this was before all these things became even worse and very few even knew about them because very few schools offered them so the only &quot;theme&quot; that fit into my schedule was called &quot;American ideals&quot;. I thought it would be simple as it was outlined as something very similar to political discourse. What I found was it was women&#039;s study courses. So I went the first few days and on the very first day the &quot;professor&quot; told the class that he did not believe in grades so everyone would receive an &quot;A&quot; whether they attended or not. I went to two classes and it was a literal breeding ground of disenfranchised mongrels looking to poison each other and everyone else so I never attended again (and received my &quot;A&quot; despite missing nearly every class). <br><br>Long story short, yes, the liberal arts sections of the colleges are not just bad but they are also indoctrination centers in my view. Go to college science sections and those people are scarce. Go to the athletic sections and they are nowhere to be seen. However, go to the liberal arts sections of the colleges and they run the show and make it a point to organize events to fuck with everyone else and spread their poison. Now a days it has spread so wide in colleges that I am sure it has infested the other sections of colleges as well.","time":1492803420,"resto":122165325,"id":"OmnzzqrF","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122174708,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)15:37:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122165325\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122165325<\/a><br>yes and yes<br><br>one of my friends called western utensils &quot;vestigial weapons&quot; (as opposed to ching-chong chopsticks)","time":1492803423,"resto":122165325,"id":"4ekbpeZ2","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122175508,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)15:44:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"Currently attending one.

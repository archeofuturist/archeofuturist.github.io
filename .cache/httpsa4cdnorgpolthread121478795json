We make a post on Facebook declaring that Facebook users join in an effort to shut down &quot;racists, homophobes, and white supremacists&quot; by infiltrating 4Chan on a specific date; to post memes etc. to counteract the &quot;negative culture&quot; we supposedly have. We then share it to places like SJW Facebook groups and OccupyDemocrats, all of the cancerous places we can where those idiots will take the bait.<br><br>Once enough of those dumbasses get the ball rolling, we share the Facebook post to \/b\/ and declare it as the Second War of 4Chan Independence; and that we should be ready to retaliate. When the hundreds\/thousands of people come to our site and post, we fight back and post any triggering shit we can to Facebook in mass quantities to be shared to as many people as possible. You can even share the triggering videos\/pictures and stuff to your family and friends and blame it on a &quot;Facebook virus&quot; that automatically shares the stuff to your wall if you accidentally click a link. Someone could even make a bait link that infects and posts shit to peoples&#039; accounts for real if they wanted. <br><br>This could get picked up on mass media and plunge Facebook into chaos if people blame them for poor content restriction\/takedown procedures. <br>Lets do this \/pol\/.","filename":"facebook has got to go","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":768,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1492403108938,"time":1492403108,"md5":"MiFph+70DPJe8Pc8ieqpLw==","fsize":68156,"resto":0,"id":"e0mghQFC","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"join-me-fellow-autists-in-4chan-independence-day","country_name":"United States","replies":4,"images":1,"unique_ips":5},{"no":121479420,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)00:31:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121478795\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121478795<\/a><br>So that thing that happened with tumblr, do it to facebook.<br>K.

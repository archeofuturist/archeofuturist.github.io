They were opponents of King Roderic and betrayed the kind at the battle, ultimately leading to his death. These traitors, called Witizans, then proceeded to effectively exterminate the surviving supporters of Roderic throughout the Regnum Visigothorum.<br><br>The Witizans then initially cooperated with the Moors before converting to Islam in large number. In return, they were granted thousands of estates and many were placed in administrative positions as reward for their treachery. We can assume that over the years, most were absorbed into the broader Moorish population and, as such, were eventually expelled as the Reconquista continued to push south.<br><br>The reason Portugal and Galicia have a comparatively high % of U106 is because these regions were settled by the Suebi. The Suebi, unlike the Visigoths, appear to have had a rather stable kingdom. This area was retaken rather quickly by the Christian principalities and therefore weren&#039;t subjected to the same amount of conquest, depopulation, repopulation, and mass migration that shook up the demographics of other parts of Iberia.","time":1492055629,"resto":120862045,"id":"oNiZOL9V","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120863131,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)23:55:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Haplogroups<\/span><br>You do realize it only tells you about who was your oldest male ancestor right?","time":1492055723,"resto":120862045,"id":"cgD4hq24","country":"TR","country_name":"Turkey"},{"no":120863418,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)23:58:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120862045\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120862045<\/a><br>So tired of muh germanic","time":1492055900,"resto":120862045,"id":"PG2CEdfK","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120863569,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)23:59:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120863131\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120863131<\/a><br>For Y-DNA, yes.

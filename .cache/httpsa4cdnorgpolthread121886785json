Texas and Georgia for the last several election cycles have been reliably red (Florida is a swing state now, but it wasn&#039;t before) Trump narrowly won those states compared to his predecessors and it&#039;s clear these two states are going the way that Florida did. All the swing states that he won, were by virtue of him NOT being Hillary and perceived as NOT being establishment. Once we&#039;re 4 years in and manufacturing jobs still haven&#039;t returned, we&#039;re going to see some serious turn-arounds in the rust belt and swing states like MI, WI, PA.<br><br>Trump only won by 2 states. Trump is not dumb and knows this, that&#039;s why he spends so much time down in Florida at Mar-a-Lago and is still campaigning in those key swing states. I don&#039;t believe republicans will get Florida in 2020 though, and at the very latest, Texas will become a swing state 2024 and be a blue state by 2032.<br><br>You guys don&#039;t understand that if he continues to diminish Bannon&#039;s role in the WH and alienates Mercer, Breitbart and a big part of his most loyal base WILL turn on him. On that same note, if he doesn&#039;t make enough concessions to neocons, they too will turn on him. Don&#039;t get your hopes up \/pol\/ or you&#039;ll be in for a rude awakening come 2020.","filename":"4112471","ext":".jpg","w":900,"h":900,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492634985199,"time":1492634985,"md5":"r3EBxnwiPNAW+eHxCB2Bjg==","fsize":79259,"resto":121886785,"id":"POvUQ3je","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121896516,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)17:07:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121886785\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121886785<\/a><br>Poor snowflakes","filename":"aJihtDz","ext":".jpg","w":1386,"h":1168,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":105,"tim":1492636042485,"time":1492636042,"md5":"XoMoiijKpIt1i\/3BWsh1LQ==","fsize":101092,"resto":121886785,"id":"vJBBVVZi","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"}]}

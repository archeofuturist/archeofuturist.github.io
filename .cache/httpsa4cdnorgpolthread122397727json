Recent reports have shown that machine-learning systems are picking up racist and sexist ideas embedded in the language patterns they are fed by human engineers. The idea that machines can be as bigoted as people is an uncomfortable one for anyone who still believes in the moral purity of the digital future, but there\u2019s nothing new or complicated about it. \u201cMachine learning\u201d is a fancy way of saying \u201cfinding patterns in data\u201d. Of course, as Lydia Nicholas, senior researcher at the innovation thinktank Nesta, explains, all this data \u201chas to have been collected in the past, and since society changes, you can end up with patterns that reflect the past. If those patterns are used to make decisions that affect people\u2019s lives you end up with unacceptable discrimination. &quot;<\/span><br><br>https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/comment<wbr>isfree\/2017\/apr\/20\/robots-racist-se<wbr>xist-people-machines-ai-language","filename":"4385","ext":".jpg","w":1240,"h":744,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":150,"tim":1492934453675,"time":1492934453,"md5":"eUhdO9anw9PFJqUoMa71nQ==","fsize":52468,"resto":0,"id":"XSpRhbgo","country":"CA","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"robots-are-racist-and-sexist-just-like-the-people","country_name":"Canada","replies":9,"images":3,"unique_ips":8},{"no":122397788,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)04:01:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Robots have been racist and sexist for as long as the people who created them have been racist and sexist, because machines can work only from the information given to them, usually by the white, straight men who dominate the fields of technology and robotics. As long ago as 1986, the medical school at St George\u2019s hospital in London was found guilty ofracial and sexual discriminationwhen it automated its admissions process based on data collected in the 1970s. The program looked at the sort of candidates who had been successful in the past, and gave similar people interviews. Unsurprisingly, the people the computer considered suitable were male, and had names that looked Anglo-Saxon.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Automation is a great excuse for assholery \u2013 after all, it\u2019s just numbers, and the magic of \u201cbig data\u201d can provide plausible deniability for prejudice. Machine learning, as the technologist Maciej Ceg\u0142owski observed, can function in this way as \u201cmoney laundering\u201d for bias.<\/span>","time":1492934497,"resto":122397727,"id":"XSpRhbgo","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122398087,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)04:06:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122397727\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122397727<\/a><br>Robot diversity matters","filename":"IMG_0260-30pct","ext":".png","w":956,"h":982,"tn_w":121,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492934776037,"time":1492934776,"md5":"qo5ztaYz6UwxXhrfeoYw6A==","fsize":942985,"resto":122397727,"id":"fupo7XJR","country":"IN","country_name":"India"},{"no":122398186,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)04:07:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122398087\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122398087<\/a><br>Toilet matters","time":1492934854,"resto":122397727,"id":"wTfzE\/WH","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122398204,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)04:07:46","com":"obviously AI is INTELLIGENT","time":1492934866,"resto":122397727,"id":"F4vWgQXt","country":"CR","trip":"!!N\/rXIUiSjoZ","country_name":"Costa Rica"},{"no":122398345,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)04:10:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122398186\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122398186<\/a><br>Bidet matters","filename":"1492621703291","ext":".jpg","w":901,"h":473,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":65,"tim":1492935003098,"time":1492935003,"md5":"wcWuFGpWps\/q00zkY4kZ5g==","fsize":66918,"resto":122397727,"id":"fupo7XJR","country":"IN","country_name":"India"},{"no":122398418,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)04:11:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122397727\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122397727<\/a><br><br>wow... people can really be that retarded","time":1492935080,"resto":122397727,"id":"fci+Qi6f","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":122398492,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)04:12:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"You guys ever notice how faceapp always tries to remove glasses of whoever you use the &#039;hot&#039; filter on?

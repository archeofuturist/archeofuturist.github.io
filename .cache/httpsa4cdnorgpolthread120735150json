The internet, technology. Block-chain. It&#039;s all the start of their demise. New countries will rise up which adapt these technologies first, maybe countries like Singapore. They will be prosperous beyond imagination with a quality of life unrivalled. And when one starts, people will demand the same, but they will flock to the better areas first. This will all start when energy becomes practically free. Solar or whatever they&#039;ll make. This will make movement of people simple and cheap, thus a country won&#039;t matter much in the future. Simply the place where we can be free the most will matter.<br><br>Save this post, and watch in a few decades how right I am. It may even start sooner than you think.

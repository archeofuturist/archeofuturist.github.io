A multicultural society without a single main culture will cause clashes between these different modes of thinking and reasoning, creating conflict and strive between its members. Loss of a main cultural narrative means a loss in overlap of moral reasoning and thus the downfall of coherence and order in a nation state. When addressing the inability of certain minority groups within a society to function at the same level as the host group, the left makes the mistake to empower the cultures of the minority groups instead of integrating them into the main culture, creating only a vicious circle of conflict, whilst having a reason to blame the host group, because all humans are inherently good and want the \u2018best\u2019, but they never define then what it exactly is that these people want. We don\u2019t speak about differences in moral values, life outlook, past and future. By seeing every person or human as the same, equal and inherently good, it is impossible to talk about problems or solutions, because any problem addressed would be a false problem and thus the person stating the problem is the problem, not the problem itself (and the addresser is branded xenofoob, racist, sexist, bigot)","time":1491994964,"resto":120735150,"id":"Fcm9+lo9","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":120743158,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)07:03:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120743107\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120743107<\/a><br>Assumption two: every person knows what\u2019s best for him<br>This assumption has led to the evaporation of social control mechanisms and calling people who act dysfunctional in check as form of prevention. It has it\u2019s origins in new ways of pedagogic parenting styles that promote individualism based on the neoliberalism notion that all humans act rationally and accordingly to self-interest. This notion is backwards and does not work if there is no civilizing process that teaches new members of society what rationality is. To a certain extent, it has worked and has given children more freedom that led to more happy and successful kids with secure attachment styles. However, this only works for kids in strong families, which similarly breaking down. The assumption has run amok, and through cultural evolution now implies : you can\u2019t tell anyone what to do based on moral concerns because ultimately it\u2019s his or her choice and freedom. Combined with the dismantling of a common civilizing process, it leads to new children that crave genuine guidance, don\u2019t receive it, feel lost in the world, and thus readily buy into capitalistic materialism as an answer to their questions. Capitalism knows consumers hardly have freedom of choice or free will, especially the weak who were never taught to think critically because we somehow assumed that critical and higher level cognition arises out of thin air, based on the assumption that humans are naturally magical fucking unicorns and culture and language has nothing to do with the way our brains are organized.

Thus, we have seen an accumulation of unsurmountable inequality in wealth over the global population. It also implies that the market can harm people and influence them in such a way that is not beneficial for them, nor the planet, nor civilization in the long run. The market is like evolution. It has no utility function but survival, and has no checks for what type of things that are desirable. The common notion is that evolution is an uphill trend or battle from primitive forms to more complexity and is often associated with the metaphor of transitioning from bad to good. This is a false assumption.

I have Crohn&#039;s disease (altho I didn&#039;t know it then) so if I had known insurance would have covered it. You have to pay extra for the style of medical treatment (consideration of what the patient wants) that was the norm back in the 60s. Back then doctors would be happy to prescribe you highly addictive or dangerous things if you simply asked, because for the most part you were white and they trusted you. Now there is way more malpractice insurance, doctors are literally told they are on the hook to pay rehab for all patients of theirs who take a drug prescribed and get addicted, and they tell them addiction rates are a x% (i&#039;m guessing above 20%) so they&#039;re being told that for each opiate prescription one of those patients is going to get a lawyer and sue for a $40,000 or more rehab bill. That would just be the first rehab, a clever lawyer would make sure they keep suing the doctors for future rehab visits. <br><br>HGH isn&#039;t really the same thing as it doesn&#039;t cause euphoria and isn&#039;t addictive, but you need some kind of &quot;failure to thrive&quot; or similar designation for HGH to be standard of care.","time":1490562197,"resto":118414134,"id":"gD9h036F","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118415257,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)17:05:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"Bump","time":1490562317,"resto":118414134,"id":"cspFKRwZ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118415768,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)17:08:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118414134\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118414134<\/a><br>Too much of a good thing...","filename":"gh","ext":".jpg","w":960,"h":720,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1490562527337,"time":1490562527,"md5":"Vx01z7kNNjtU2VkAJjP++g==","fsize":67805,"resto":118414134,"id":"l1dDUMAn","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118415851,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)17:09:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;tfw actually took HGH at 17 but system caught me and my doc<\/span><br><br>I dont get it<br><br>If I&#039;m paying for it myself why is it a problem<br><br>Fuck sake I could have gained at least 2 more inches","time":1490562562,"resto":118414134,"id":"HL+LhlwI","country":"DK","country_name":"Denmark"},{"no":118416139,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)17:11:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118415851\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118415851<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;If I&#039;m paying for it myself why is it a problem<\/span><br><br>sooner rather than later other will be paying for it.","time":1490562682,"resto":118414134,"id":"hyDCwXOs","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118416196,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)17:11:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118415851\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118415851<\/a><br>did you grow?","time":1490562705,"resto":118414134,"id":"NByzTzaK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118416197,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)17:11:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118414134\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118414134<\/a><br>My mother wanted asked me if I wanted to receive hormones as a kid because of my short stature.

This is how humanity evolved, you either submit to the family unit, die or through your own industrious action create a family of your own. This is the evolutionary synthesis of collectivism and individualism that needs to be emulated.<br><br>Individualism itself can refer to small collective units. Marriage itself resulted in a greater individual union between husband and wife (or so it used to anyway). The Romans operated under a system of patriarchy, with patriarchs being the heads of the family. To the state, all of these patriarchs were individuals themselves, despite representing collective units.<br><br>The idea that there exists one single collective or a complete disorganized mass of individual people is a false dichotomy.","time":1493723564,"resto":123753787,"id":"GaZxy68N","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123756768,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)07:13:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123756011\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123756011<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Not to mention that all the top libertarian philosophers just so happen to be Jews.

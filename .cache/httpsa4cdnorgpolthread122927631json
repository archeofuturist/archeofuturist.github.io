This theses is most notably put forward by Gershom G. Scholem (1897-1982) and Gilles Quispel (1916-2006). Scholem detected Jewish gnosis in the imagery of the merkavah, which can also be found in &quot;Christian&quot; Gnostic documents, for example Paul&#039;s ascencion to the third heaven.[37] Quispel sees Gnosticism as an independent Jewish development, tracing its origins to Alexandrian Jews., to which Valentinus was also connected.[39] According to Robert M. Grant, Gnosticism developed out of &quot;the remains of apocalyptic escatological expectations after the fall of Jerusalem,&quot; which shattered the hopes of the coming of God&#039;s kingdom on earth and lead to a rejection of the world. Gnosticism united material from the &quot;outer fringes of Judaism,&quot; such as the Essenes and the Diaspora Judaism of the Aramaic Syro-Mesopotamian world.[39]<br><br>i stick to mormonism and its concrete teachings about god in a multiverse understanding<br><br>i guess it all depends if you view the world as knowable or not and i think it is knowable","time":1493241730,"resto":122927631,"id":"lSgImqrs","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122941342,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)17:22:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122931279\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122931279<\/a><br><a href=\"#p122927964\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122927964<\/a><br><a href=\"#p122927802\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122927802<\/a><br><br>I&#039;m not a christfag but it very clearly states that the devil is the angel that told Adam and eve to eat the forbidden fruit to give them free will, god banished him from heaven as punishment","time":1493241743,"resto":122927631,"id":"R5wYppb6","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"},{"no":122941711,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)17:24:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122940166\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122940166<\/a><br>Jesus called himself Cain according to the christian bible.

The state or the place of the dead was regarded as solemn and gloomy, and thence the word sheol, the name of this place, came to be applied to any gloomy, or miserable state or condition. The following passages are examples: &quot;The sorrows of hell compassed me about; the snares of death prevented me.&quot; Psalm xvii 4-6. This was a past event, and therefore the hell must have been this side of death. Solomon, speaking of a child, says, &quot;Thou shalt beat him, and deliver his soul from hell;&quot; that is, from the ruin and woe of disobedience. ProV xxiiI 14. The Lord says to Israel, in reference to their idolatries, &quot;Thou didst debase thyself even unto hell.&quot; Isaiah lvii 9. This, of course, signifies a state of utter moral degradation and wickedness, since the Jewish nation as such certainly never went down into a hell of ceaseless woe. Jonah says, &quot;Out of the belly of hell cried I, and thou heardst me.&quot; ii 2. Here we see the absurdity of supposing sheol or hell to mean a place of punishment after death. The hell in this case was the belly of the whale; or rather the wretched and suffering condition in which the disobedient prophet found himself. &quot;The pains of hell got hold on me: I found trouble and sorrow.&quot; Ps. cxvi 3. Yet David was a living man, all this while, here on the earth. So he exclaims again, &quot;Great is thy mercy towards me. Thou hast delivered my soul from the lowest hell.&quot; Ps. lxxxvi 13. Now here the Psalmist was in the lowest hell, and was delivered from it, while he was yet in the body, before death.

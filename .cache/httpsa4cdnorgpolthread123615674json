I live in a town that&#039;s pretty segregated, whites stay in the suburbs and dindus stay in downtown and hospital area. <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Wife and I are looking for a house for our family, currently at 2 but we will have 2 more to do my duty for my race.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; we are in our twenties, we have college degrees we did everything right. We make too much money to qualify for most first time home buyer programs. <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; find 5 bedroom house that fits our budget. We get excited.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; drive over to the neighborhood which is in the suburbs and known for white neighborhoods.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; fucking filled with niggers and spics the whole goddamn neighborhood. Not the clean kind either the fucking wear your night clothes with no fucking bra watering the fucking driveway.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; find out from development friend of mine that downtown is being gentrified and they are moving the niggers into the suburbs and out of downtown and are giving minorities financial incentives to do so. <\/span><br><br>WTF \/pol\/. I did everything right and now I&#039;m being rewarded by deciding whether to live in a loft downtown in a crowded space with fucking liberals or live in a suburb with a backyard but surrounded by the unclean.","filename":"IMG_1151","ext":".jpg","w":780,"h":520,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1493642188006,"time":1493642188,"md5":"giO3QYt1Ix8iMpPueOtmhg==","fsize":184595,"resto":0,"id":"Y+y6vDTQ","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"local-white-genocide","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":123616374,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)08:43:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"i&#039;m a muzzie here, so by south you mean mainly swamp land or heavy forestation? if you want a clean living area(backyard, front yard no nigz&#039;nspics) and you have the money for it, buy a few acres of forested land, hire a contractor to build a house, and if you are capable at handy work around the house, you yourself can then cut trees and make lumber for your own modifications, initial costs may be a bit steep but if you use tools and watch DIY youtube channels and learn a few things, you can do with work and spend money on insurrance and child costs(school medications and other stuff), and if you need repairs done around the house you yourself can do such repairs but if its something you would rather not dable with, hire someone, this way you can reduce your costs for house maintenace pretty low. hope this advice helps","time":1493642603,"resto":123615674,"id":"kSDaQRP2","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123617996,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)08:59:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123616374\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123616374<\/a><br>That&#039;s probably not an efficient use of his time in a specialized economy, Tamir al-omman.","time":1493643553,"resto":123615674,"id":"xTkYmzss","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

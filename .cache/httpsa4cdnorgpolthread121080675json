It was an off duty cop working at a bouncer. Non-police bouncers generally are not armed, correct. I imagine they hire off-duty cops instead of otherwise armed security due to liability. If they go to court they can show they paid extra for security connected to the local PD which probably would actually result in faster response times, more ability, can enforce the law, etc. <br><br>But really I want to know... was it the tranny drag show that pushed Omar off the edge? https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=6AA<wbr>vFGf2FRc","time":1492189038,"resto":121080675,"id":"tNQQI9VC","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121083059,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)12:57:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121082307\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121082307<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;orlando<\/span>","time":1492189056,"resto":121080675,"id":"oFADVl9S","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121083129,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)12:58:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121082720\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121082720<\/a><br>do you think that cop can stop 10 angry durkas from durking ?","time":1492189095,"resto":121080675,"id":"NZwBouqh","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":121083306,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)12:59:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121083022\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121083022<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Omar<\/span><br><br>from what i heard he was a faggot and visited that butt club several times","time":1492189190,"resto":121080675,"id":"NZwBouqh","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":121084323,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)13:08:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121080675\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121080675<\/a><br><br>a few things that might have gone wrong at the Bataclan;<br><br>the concert hall was run by (((you know who))), and supported Isreal, they have been under threat for sometime it seems (youtube vid can show this, CBA linking it). <br><br>According to the band, a door was propped open, though they don&#039;t specify where\/why, or what purpose it had.

What I believe here is that it shows the divide between the politics of ISIS in Syria as a territorial mission, and the west&#039;s issue with muslims who reside in ghettos. All of the jihadis involved we&#039;re from Molenbeek, and had links to networks in St Denis and Birmingham, and as I understand it, they we&#039;re all fucktards with little-to-no purpose in life.

It was an off duty cop working at a bouncer. Non-police bouncers generally are not armed, correct. I imagine they hire off-duty cops instead of otherwise armed security due to liability. If they go to court they can show they paid extra for security connected to the local PD which probably would actually result in faster response times, more ability, can enforce the law, etc. <br><br>But really I want to know... was it the tranny drag show that pushed Omar off the edge? https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=6AA<wbr>vFGf2FRc","time":1492189038,"resto":121080675,"id":"tNQQI9VC","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121083059,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)12:57:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121082307\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121082307<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;orlando<\/span>","time":1492189056,"resto":121080675,"id":"oFADVl9S","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121083129,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)12:58:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121082720\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121082720<\/a><br>do you think that cop can stop 10 angry durkas from durking ?","time":1492189095,"resto":121080675,"id":"NZwBouqh","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":121083306,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)12:59:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121083022\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121083022<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Omar<\/span><br><br>from what i heard he was a faggot and visited that butt club several times","time":1492189190,"resto":121080675,"id":"NZwBouqh","country":"FR","country_name":"France"}]}

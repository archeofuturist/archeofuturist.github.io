I know UKIP is still a thing, but are they really any use at this point? Their stance on immigration, (Australian point system) is alright, but it doesn&#039;t get rid of the Muslims, niggers, and Gopniks that are already present in your country.<br>I think if UKIP died and was replaced with a new party which promised heavy immigration restrictions, the implementation of Powell&#039;s repatriation system, and really just projected some semblance of National pride, National identity they would be very successful.<br>Is that a fair assessment?

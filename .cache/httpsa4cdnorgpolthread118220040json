Arron Banks is dodgy at best but still miles better than Nuttall and his party of Tory shills. Banks is setting up a new party called the Patriotic Alliance, which hopes to cross party lines and unite those who voted Brexit. It&#039;s better than UKIP at this point. Alternatively, Joe Owens is setting up a new political party (https:\/\/www.josephowens.co.uk\/) and I highly recommend you check this out.

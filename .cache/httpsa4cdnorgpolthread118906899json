Moreover, even if it were the case that one&#039;s real income would rise as a result of immigration, it does not follow that immigration must be considered &quot;good,&quot; for material wealth is not the only thing that matters. Rather, what constitutes &quot;welfare&quot; and &quot;wealth&quot; is subjective, and one might prefer lower material living standards and a greater distance from certain other people over higher material living standards and a smaller distance. It is precisely the absolute voluntariness of human association and separation-the absence of any form of forced integration-which makes peaceful relationships-free trade-between racially, ethnically, linguistically, religiously, or culturally distinct people possible.<\/span>","time":1490870827,"resto":118906899,"id":"23WPiMeQ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118909620,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)06:47:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118909234\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118909234<\/a><br><br>There&#039;s no reason you have to spends &quot;thousands on [their] your own to purify it&quot;. <br><br>There&#039;d be companies to purify and sell water - just as we have now.

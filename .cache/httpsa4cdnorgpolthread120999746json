We&#039;d be beings of pure energy that only radiate peace and love if the clock was set back a few hours. The universe would have to be empty and devoid of all life and matter, except for this fucking clock, before it would move back to it&#039;s starting position.","time":1492135721,"resto":120999746,"id":"LZOR4bIR","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]}

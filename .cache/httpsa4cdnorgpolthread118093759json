Here the mythological projection of psychic material appears in cosmogonic form, as the mythology of creation. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;One symbol of original perfection is the circle. Allied to it are the sphere, the egg, and the rotundum \u2013 the &quot;round&quot; of alchemy. It is Plato&#039;s round that was there in the beginning:<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;Therefore the demiurge made the world in the shape of a sphere, giving it that figure which of all is the most perfect and the most equal to itself.&quot;<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Circle, sphere, and round are all aspects of the Self-contained, which is without beginning and end; in its prewordly perfection it is prior to any process, eternal, for in its roundness there is no before and no after, no time; and there is no above and no below, no space.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;[...]<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;[The World Egg] is also the perfect state in which the opposites are united \u2013 the perfect beginning because the opposites have not yet flown apart and the world has not yet begun, the perfect end because in it the opposites have come together again in a synthesis and the world is once more at rest. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;We described the adolescent&#039;s advance towards independence and liberation as &quot;self-division&quot;. To become conscious of oneself, to be conscious at all, begins with saying &quot;no&quot; to the uroboros, the Great Mother, to the unconscious. And when we scrutinize the acts upon which consciousness and the ego are built up, we must admit that to begin with they are all negative acts. To discriminate, to distinguish, to mark off, to isolate oneself from the surrounding context \u2013 these are the basic acts of consciousness. [...] for the motto of all consciousness is DETERMINATION EST NEGATIO.

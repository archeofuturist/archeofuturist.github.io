Yes it matters a little. But you faggots have a million websites to support your worthless social awareness causes, specifically made for you. Reddit, Twitter, Facebook .. literally every site on the planet was made for your kind. <br>Go there and rub one out, don&#039;t come here on a site where real discourse is appreciated and spam it with 5 word sentences about your support or non-support of whatever daily cause your brainwashed TV mind has come up with now.<br><br>Here are the people who are allowed to respond to my post:<br><br>1. People who don&#039;t have a Facebook account. <br>2. People over age 23<br>3. Only Americans, Europeans, Australians (yes, no Canadians. Yes I add this specifically because Canadians are too cunty to read with comprehension)<br>4. People who don&#039;t smoke or do drugs. Alcohol drinkers are allowed but only because I&#039;d otherwise get no responses at all.<br>5. People who think that race differences are real and serious but aren&#039;t nazis. Look fuckwad, national socialism is dead. Find a new name but you can&#039;t use this one, Rockwell made the same mistake. Now shut the fuck up about your goddamn holocaust crap, it was real and even if it wasn&#039;t I wouldn&#039;t want to hear about it just like I don&#039;t want to hear about your MTG collection or the latest MLP episode.<br>6. People who despise nihilism<br><br><br>Everyone else: You have the entire catalog to choose from because the mods apparently feel the need to delete PRO-CHRiSTIAN, PRO-STRAIGHT, ANTI-ALCOHOL threads but they leave a million threads like pic related up for hours and hours, much longer than mine.","filename":"this is you","ext":".jpg","w":1497,"h":1000,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":167,"tim":1492498326820,"time":1492498326,"md5":"qI1BntzoIYDtc2RmQuU+Ug==","fsize":136362,"resto":0,"id":"3EncjHd1","country":"AT","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"cant-you-fuckwads-just-join-a-facebook-group-or","country_name":"Austria","replies":4,"images":2,"unique_ips":4},{"no":121652191,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)02:57:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"How about you suck a sick nigger faggot","time":1492498671,"resto":121651733,"id":"O\/w+ncxz","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121652307,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)02:59:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121651733\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121651733<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;People who don&#039;t smoke or do drugs<\/span><br>GG NO RE <br>i am out boys","filename":"curveyWHITEwomanTHARJA","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":1024,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492498762651,"time":1492498762,"md5":"S6HHCuPsokDvIs0\/47UocQ==","fsize":107058,"resto":121651733,"id":"CCSf1g4L","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":121652913,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)03:07:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;write long OP with well thought-out content and theory<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;nice blog post&quot;<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;culled in 2 minutes by flood of meaningless current-events posts<\/span><br>We need to bring back longposting and considerations on theory and dispel the worthless notion that proper \/pol\/posting is soundbites and news articles.

Being uncertain and doubting himself openly are not particularly alpha traits. Take awkward or unfortunate situations with a sense of humor, have a deep sense of gratefulness for good or fortunate outcomes. It&#039;s also a masculine trait to be humble and down-to-earth time to time, being overly confrontational or egocentric are signs of insecurity.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What specific skills should they have? <\/span><br>Being self-reliant, financially independent, being willing to learn new things, being able to do things with your own hands, having a knack for technical skills, being able to tinker with equipment... in short, less dependant you are on other people, the more masculine you appear. Of course you also have to rely to other people for many things to be done, but ideally it should be a favour-for-favour thing, not a dependent relationship<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What should they know how to do? <\/span><br>Think for themselves, know where to go or what to do to learn how to solve a problem. Take charge when expected of them and they have the competence to take charge in the situation. Again, it&#039;s very important to have technical know-how, since minimal technical know-how in the current year means you have left at the mercy of other people a lot more, and they might screw you over or do things their way.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What should they have accomplished?<\/span><br>Should know what field you are best cut out for by the time you are 20-something and should ideally work out the path you must undertake. By the time you reach 30-something, you must already have achieved enough that you can start working your dream job or follow the career path that is your specialty. By the time you are between 40-60 you should reach the peak of your career and ideally strive to aim leadership positions at your field.","filename":"1490580314190","ext":".png","w":810,"h":744,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":114,"tim":1493314487931,"time":1493314487,"md5":"cbrwzUkj6IXndS205XMYfQ==","fsize":1028654,"resto":123058513,"id":"b9eMfICO","country":"EE","country_name":"Estonia"},{"no":123062402,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)13:44:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123061312\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123061312<\/a><br>Good post, but what specifically do you mean by technical skills and tinkering with things with your hands?","filename":"Alex Jones 2","ext":".jpg","w":320,"h":320,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493315044531,"time":1493315044,"md5":"Py30GS6hTuKovPGSayVlmA==","fsize":29112,"resto":123058513,"id":"PvmCl1Sp","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

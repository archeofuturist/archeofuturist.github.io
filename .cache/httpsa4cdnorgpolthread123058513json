Mostly I mean very basic stuff like if you own a car, you also carry some basic tools that can fix the easier problems about the car, and you know how to use them. Like if you own a computer, you also know how to google well and find solutions for all sorts of lighter computer issues (audio not working, video player not playing a certain format etc.)<br><br>By tinkering, I mean again basic stuff first, like what to do when the sink pipes are clogged up, how to fix a broken cupboard door, how to change the lightbulb etc. but even better if you teach yourself how to build basic furniture, can fix electric appliances in some cases and how to paint a wooden fence etc.<br><br>I am personally not too crafty with building stuff or fixing random tech but my father is very gifted with that stuff. I just personally have set the goal that I will learn that stuff too some time in the future when I start a family.<br><br>Also, it&#039;s important to add, that men only become more valuable, desirable and gather more authority as they get older, which only begins to plummet as they get older than 60 or so. With women, their value is highest when they are 20 or so, when they are most fertile, young, beautiful etc. but after that age, their market value starts to decline, and if they want to keep earn deep respect from their community, only way for women to do this is to do a good job at raising children or keeping a harmonious home environment for their husbands. This is a very important task as well, I think men don&#039;t achieve shit if it wasn&#039;t for the women who perform the tasks men are not that well suited for, such as a knack for home decoration, good social skills, sharp intuition, ability to multitask etc.","time":1493316264,"resto":123058513,"id":"b9eMfICO","country":"EE","country_name":"Estonia"},{"no":123065385,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)14:09:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123064622\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123064622<\/a><br>I like this.

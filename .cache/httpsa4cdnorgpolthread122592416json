The only way to change it isn&#039;t to scream and whine and get the government to make things different. it&#039;s to start being politicians and combat sexism with social empathy. Its my opinion that this kind of behavior has only increased sexism against women. a large portion of feminists think they can get the government to mandate a kind of opinion set and it shows when they ruin and ban their own gender from institutions if they don&#039;t follow and spread the image they want spread.<br><br>So its no real suprise that pol is the same way, they don&#039;t understand that jews are the way they are because they where forced into blase and hated jobs like usury and those jobs turned out to be very important and productive, just like other religious dissidants. It would be a stretch to say they are there as merit but it&#039;s not a conspiracy, europe took the actions that would put them in power, and then whined about all the power they had. for funsies you can also show that in various times certain dynasties and rulers of countries where all headed by someone with blood relation to britain, so in the 1800s was monarchy a british conspiracy? according to pol, who uses the same way of thinking on jews, it would have to be. Jews aren&#039;t the enemy, and it&#039;s important that pol realize this because the longer they go without understanding it, when they finally take down the jew, they will simply become the jew, just like feminists are now being sexist against women in the place of men who wont be. <br><br>if you think power doesn&#039;t corrupt. you need to watch this,<br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=rSt<wbr>L7niR7gs","filename":"1489076267879","ext":".jpg","w":912,"h":300,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":41,"tim":1493045299670,"time":1493045299,"md5":"zmwSQzm0dZfTwPjLkh15vQ==","fsize":256648,"resto":122592416,"id":"wArLMoIw","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122595507,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)11:11:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122593184\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122593184<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;the only real difference is this one.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Both theories imply that the \u201cend-game\u201d of the conspirators has something to do with the demolition of the \u201ctraditional\u201d society.<\/span><br>Yea, I guess I could have worded it somewhat better.

Civilization has been built on patriarchy, but Is society in the US patriarchal though? I think that its not patriarchal but matriarchal, and that is why our society is falling apart.<br>Well, our economy is still built on a patriarchy, but society in the US is matriarchal. Consider the following:<br><br>-Women hold 100% of reproductive rights, including over men&#039;s potential progeny. Is it your child she&#039;s aborting? too bad, so sad.<br>-Women raise the children. <br>-Women make up 85% of custodial parents. (women can not teach boys how to be men, probably the primary reason for the transtrenders)<br>-Women educate the children. Women make up 80% of the teachers, and this is primarily the reason for the fact that boys are universally and broadly, falling behind in US education from K through college. A boy not only has no male parent strongly represented in his life but may not even come across a male teacher and their first male mentor may be their first boss.<br>-Women make the financial decisions in families. From everything to groceries to furniture to investing. And studies show that the final decisions on large purchases for couples, like houses and cars, are made by the woman.<br>-Women make the social decisions in families. Studies show that the decisions on who the children will play with, where the family goes on vacation, and what social events the family attends, are made by the woman.<br><br>This is our society. Where is all this supposed societal power held by men? They hold power only in the workplace, but employment isn&#039;t society.

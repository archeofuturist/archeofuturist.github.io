Atheism is in decline worldwide, with the number of atheists falling from 4.5% of the world&#039;s population in 1970 to 2.0% in 2010 and projected to drop to 1.8% by 2020, <br><br>Real surveys and statistics say atheism is on the decline worldwide. Sorry atheists but atheism is not on the rise nor is it winning. It&#039;s still the minority and a declining one at that. <br><br>The Pew Research Center&#039;s statistics show that atheism is expected to continue to decline all the way into 2050 with a continued growth of religion. Other research also shows a huge surge in growth for Christianity in China which is currently the world&#039;s most &quot;atheist&quot; nation because of the atheist communist government suppressing religion, the research suggests that China will soon become the world&#039;s most Christian nation within 15 years. <br><br>This is simply history repeating itself: Christianity prospered in Rome back in the ancient era when it was suppressed and it still grew in the militant atheist soviet Russia when it was suppressed there only a century ago with the majority of Russians today now also identifying as Christian. Just goes to show that atheist suppression of religion still doesn&#039;t stop religion.<br><br>Sources for the legion of whiny \/Redditor\/ fedoras that will no doubt show up it this thread:<br><br>http:\/\/www.pewforum.org\/2015\/04\/02\/<wbr>religious-projections-2010-2050\/<br>http:\/\/www.pewforum.org\/2012\/12\/18\/<wbr>global-religious-landscape-unaffili<wbr>ated\/<br>http:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/news\/wor<wbr>ldnews\/asia\/china\/10776023\/China-on<wbr>-course-to-become-worlds-most-Chris<wbr>tian-nation-within-15-years.html<br>http:\/\/masterrussian.com\/russia\/fac<wbr>ts.htm","filename":"1488223422556","ext":".png","w":264,"h":200,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":189,"tim":1493182652324,"time":1493182652,"md5":"CZeJ6Dns1Hdbc+F3CtMj9A==","fsize":276085,"resto":0,"id":"dt9yyo+n","country":"PL","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"atheism-is-the-fastest-shrinking-religion-in-the","country_name":"Poland","replies":10,"images":1,"unique_ips":8},{"no":122845644,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)00:59:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122845460\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122845460<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;It&#039;s another thread by the polish christcuck who posts photoshopped images of atheists that are actually christcucks doing christcuck things. <\/span><br>Scrub toilet","filename":"Do you like to hurt normies","ext":".jpg","w":915,"h":1146,"tn_w":99,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493182771994,"time":1493182771,"md5":"YVT5Im2xm2SgHtl6jAGB5A==","fsize":97006,"resto":122845460,"id":"spmbqoVA","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":122846364,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)01:07:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122845460\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122845460<\/a><br>Fedoras usually kill themselves eventually","time":1493183231,"resto":122845460,"id":"JDZ6AF48","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122846466,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)01:08:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;christian empires built Western Civilization<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Atheist empires destroyed it within a century<\/span><br><br>How does it feel knowing that you&#039;re single-handedly responsible for the fall of the west, atheistfags?","time":1493183294,"resto":122845460,"id":"vQoqDci4","country":"IL","country_name":"Israel"},{"no":122847439,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)01:18:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122846364\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122846364<\/a><br>See the thing is the Fedoras were the people who went and became part of that new age mumbo jumbo with mother god and witch craft pagan shit. but once that ran it&#039;s course and they amassed to baggage and became the butt of many jokes they went on to Atheism. since instead of trying to lord over you with smug spiritual guidance they found quasi smug enlightenment more palatable. now they were firmly entrenched in atheism. hover they decided to make Atheism+ and that just ran everybody but the biggest fedora lord out of that.","time":1493183880,"resto":122845460,"id":"m2Cko4i3","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122848087,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)01:24:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122847439\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122847439<\/a><br>With repentance of sin, the load is just to much to bear.

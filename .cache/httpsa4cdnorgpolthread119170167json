From the very beginning, he has made a point that his party was his own thing. It was never part of the left and never part of the right. You can&#039;t betray what you weren&#039;t part of.<br><br>All I see is the argument that &quot;the centre always used to side with the right&quot;, which is bullshit, if your party is always going to join force withthe same side, you might as well not be a party of your own. <br><br>Bayrou has much more honesty than the UDI (Union de D\u00e9mocrates et Ind\u00e9pendant), aparty whose purpose is much more to raly moderate to the right than be its own movement. Yet people call him traitor because he didn&#039;t follow the hanit of his predecessor.<br><br>then there is calling him a flip-flopper when he has been one of the most consistent man in politic. Anyone who take 3 seconds to think about could see, that politically, Hollande was way closer to Bayrou&#039;s ideology than Sarkozy was.<br><br>Voting for the person that is the closest to your own views isn&#039;t flip-flopping.<br><br>It&#039;s like French people actually want their politic to be bi-polarized and Bayrou is an anomaly to them...","filename":"0","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":600,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491047875424,"time":1491047875,"md5":"MnzHgFrUL\/e+u8yyIgbtWw==","fsize":53489,"resto":119170167,"id":"pSdikqoo","country":"BE","country_name":"Belgium"},{"no":119173192,"now":"04\/01\/17(Sat)07:59:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119172809\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119172809<\/a><br>working 1 years for a business doesn&#039;t make you its puppet, though.","time":1491047968,"resto":119170167,"id":"pSdikqoo","country":"BE","country_name":"Belgium"},{"no":119173517,"now":"04\/01\/17(Sat)08:04:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119173192\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119173192<\/a><br>2 years, sorry.","time":1491048281,"resto":119170167,"id":"pSdikqoo","country":"BE","country_name":"Belgium"},{"no":119173558,"now":"04\/01\/17(Sat)08:05:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119172399\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119172399<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Ha.

This was the view of the greatest astronomer of the age, Tyco Brahe. The Church&#039;s view of heliocentrism was hardly a dogmatic one. When Cardinal Bellarmine met with Galileo he said, &quot;While experience tells us plainly that the earth is standing still, if there were a real proof that the sun is in the center of the universe\u2026and that the sun goes not go round the earth but the earth round the sun, then we should have to proceed with great circumspection in explaining passages of scripture which appear to teach the contrary, and rather admit that we did not understand them than declare an opinion to be false which is proved to be true. But this is not a thing to be done in haste, and as for myself, I shall not believe that there are such proofs until they are shown to me.&quot; Galileo had no such proofs.<\/span>","time":1493315593,"resto":123057632,"id":"vVB1F9D+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123063516,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)13:53:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123063032\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123063032<\/a><br>Dude no one cares if you have money or not in the church.

The way the way of life is formalized for teaching, how detailed the worldview or the way of life is, and its overall purpose differs between religions. &quot;Organized religion&quot; is a name for a political institution that upholds it. How they uphold it depends on the institution.<br><br>Such as with any group supportive of a system of thought (compare to the support of naturalism in academia, for example) there is a bias but nothing of it inherently denies thinking differently and speaking differently. At best you can say that people will reject you from a group if you deny the worldview, which is true of any institution that promotes a worldview, or they and their followers will not like you, which is inescapable because all societies have a view of what is good and so have norms.<br><br>You literally have zero basis for attacking &quot;organized religion&quot; and the term itself is ridiculous. You&#039;ve just bought the memes.<br><br><a href=\"#p123069094\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123069094<\/a><br><br>And again with people who disagree with the nature of anything in reality, why do you have a hard time taking any of us seriously if we disagree?

But I don&#039;t think it&#039;s millennials&#039; fault if we&#039;re not spending enough time outside. It&#039;s partially the fault of our workaholic culture,&quot; Meyer said. &quot;When young people start a job that has two weeks of vacation, making only $31,000 a year but with $100,000 of student debt right out of college, you don&#039;t have time to go traveling to these places, even if they&#039;re only a day&#039;s drive away.&quot;<br><br>Meyer spent four years saving money for the trip and planning out the logistics of thousands of miles on the road.<br><br>He also spent those four years trying to pitch the trip to outdoors companies in order to pick up funding. Even though he was &quot;very out in [his] own life,&quot; he kept his sexual orientation a little more under wraps &quot;because the outdoor and travel industry is very heteronormative.&quot;<br><br>Meyer said, &quot;The only ads you see are gay people going to beaches and bars.&quot;<br><br>But from the day Meyer set out and started sharing his story, he started getting emails from queer park rangers, teenagers and 100-year-old men who told him, &quot;&#039;Thank you for doing this. We felt like our voices have never been heard before, but now, through your journey, we feel like our stories are being told,&#039;&quot; he said.<br><br>So Meyer threw financial caution to the wind and let loose his story as an out-and-proud young, gay Christian.","filename":"Screen Shot 2017-04-27 at 5.49.30 PM","ext":".png","w":1626,"h":1142,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":175,"tim":1493338322705,"time":1493338322,"md5":"LyLBknyS36cCfrmcp8BqYg==","fsize":1759430,"resto":0,"id":"X\/TNoISO","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"does-pol-support-national-parks","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":123115033,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)20:15:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"I quite like that they exist and that it&#039;s not hard to find sensible staff rather than just modern (((liberal))) mushheads.

About two weeks beforehand, this guy had given me a long smug lecture about the evils of guns in private hands.

My wife came out with sandwiches while I was working and as usual had a good laugh at me. Not in a mean way, just amused a bit at how grimly I was going about the task. The previous tenant had left the barbed wire, a half dozen animal traps and some buckets of nails. Only the week beforehand I was complaining to the landlord about the big fat coil of rusty barbwire in the outdoor garage. I set the animal traps in the weeds on the other sides of the gates, because they were the most likely spots for a rioter to try to get a handhold to leap over the fence and land on the other side. Then I set my wife to making caltrops out of the nails using some ten penny wire. In about two hours we had made a couple dozen and I spread these all over the front lawn hidden by blades of grass. Since I had never made a caltrop before in my life I had a weird sense of accomplishment at this.<br><br>The sun was going down again and everybody on the block was vanishing into their homes on cue.

He clawed at it to pull it out of his sole, dropped over the fence again pulling himself on his elbows and doing that funny whine. I had to clamp my hand over my mouth to keep from laughing, I had tears coming to my eyes. He finally got back up and started hopping down the sidewalk on one foot, leaving a trail of blood droplets behind him.

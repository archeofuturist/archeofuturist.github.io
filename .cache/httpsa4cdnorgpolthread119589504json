I&#039;m trying to get on disability as a white male who went to college. Is there any chance of me getting any money from the government? I have a traumatic brain injury from a head wound and continuous partial grand mall seizures that prevent me from driving or living a normal life at all. I spent a few years at college before my seizures forced me to drop out in favour of my health and the little money I&#039;ve made cannot support me if I ever want to have a family. I don&#039;t smoke cigarettes but I smoke marijuana because it helps with my medication side effects and the oncoming feeling of having a seizure is terrifying and marijuana helps subside it. I live near Chicago so I assume with all the blacks getting money for bullshit that a white man down on his luck due to things out of his control would be able to atleast get some sort of government subsidy.<br><br>pic related: the brain tumor","filename":"IMG_0569","ext":".jpg","w":2448,"h":3264,"tn_w":187,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491385268003,"time":1491385268,"md5":"O9tz3o1YxzjCDHlaDzaDqQ==","fsize":1057072,"resto":0,"id":"S\/7U8FwJ","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"hi-pol-i-know-this-is-definitely-not-the-right","country_name":"United States","replies":24,"images":6,"unique_ips":11},{"no":119589588,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)05:42:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119589504\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119589504<\/a><br>no you&#039;re white, you get nothing.<br>good bye","time":1491385349,"resto":119589504,"id":"u7hgdCJ1","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119589614,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)05:42:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;White Male<\/span><br>Can&#039;t your privilege just fix itself UGH.","filename":"Not a pedophile but","ext":".jpg","w":1300,"h":955,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":91,"tim":1491385375549,"time":1491385375,"md5":"51jQXY766N2I0s+kSh\/8rQ==","fsize":74839,"resto":119589504,"id":"FnIWvbVA","country":"AU","m_img":1,"country_name":"Australia"},{"no":119589718,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)05:44:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119589504\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119589504<\/a><br>DUDE WEED","time":1491385468,"resto":119589504,"id":"DFCvLvPK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119589782,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)05:45:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119589588\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119589588<\/a><br>fpbp <br><br> Honestly thats what I&#039;m expecting.

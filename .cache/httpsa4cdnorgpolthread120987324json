Can&#039;t remember who was explaining this but there a lump of meteorite rock in the black cube building in Mecca. The question is, why to Muslims worship a rock? Well, here&#039;s the explanation... Pre-Muslim Pagans had a ritual\/custom where they would keep a nice rock that they found. When they found a better rock, they would throw away the old rock and keep the new rock. Mohamed was raised as a Pagan so obviously knew about this custom. Despite the story that Mohamed had the Quran dictated to him by Allah over a period of time and despite the fact that the Quran states that they should not worship images or idols (that include rocks), Mohamed liked the old custom of worshiping a rock so that&#039;s why this has continued in Islam.<br><br>The other thing to note about this black cube building with a rock it in it is that all those muzzles walk around it 7 times.... Why? Because at the time of Mohamed, they only knew about 7 planets in the Solar System and the the Pagans believed that each planet in the Solar System had a Deity\/God that should be worshipped. Of course, this is blasphemy according to the Quran but Mohamed like the ritual so it continued. <br><br>Anyway, the point is that Islam is a fucking joke.","time":1492131311,"resto":120987324,"id":"GiZdIm5M","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120993200,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)20:56:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120987324\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120987324<\/a><br>hopefully they don&#039;t have any supermonkeys","filename":"Screen Shot 2017-04-13 at 5.50.38 PM","ext":".png","w":841,"h":194,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":28,"tim":1492131379771,"time":1492131379,"md5":"f8HFKoRILl\/1\/8eB\/52h4w==","fsize":97303,"resto":120987324,"id":"7BcAydRl","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120993952,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)21:01:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120987324\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120987324<\/a><br>That thing has been destroyed multiple times, the muslims just rebuild it.","time":1492131680,"resto":120987324,"id":"vNn38GH4","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120994162,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)21:02:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120993952\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120993952<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;That thing has been destroyed multiple times<\/span><br>sauce?","time":1492131762,"resto":120987324,"id":"GiZdIm5M","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120994346,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)21:04:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120987324\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120987324<\/a> <a href=\"#p120987538\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120987538<\/a> <a href=\"#p120987847\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120987847<\/a> <a href=\"#p120988209\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120988209<\/a> <a href=\"#p120988763\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120988763<\/a> <a href=\"#p120989072\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120989072<\/a> <a href=\"#p120989446\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120989446<\/a> <a href=\"#p120989537\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120989537<\/a> <a href=\"#p120990063\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120990063<\/a> <a href=\"#p120990765\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120990765<\/a> <a href=\"#p120990859\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120990859<\/a> <a href=\"#p120990953\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120990953<\/a> <a href=\"#p120991337\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120991337<\/a> <a href=\"#p120991729\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120991729<\/a> <a href=\"#p120992610\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120992610<\/a> <a href=\"#p120992783\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120992783<\/a> <a href=\"#p120993044\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120993044<\/a> <a href=\"#p120993952\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120993952<\/a> <a href=\"#p120994162\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120994162<\/a><br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=q41<wbr>X7zNdhDc<br><br>Shia Lebouf wants NUCLEAR WAR!

You&#039;re not winning anymore. Trump won the election but the nation is divided and the administration is showing it can&#039;t even pander to it&#039;s constituents correctly (look at the healthcare bill Trump is backing). People are catching up to his lies (&quot;everyone will be covered!&quot;). His approval rating is representative of someone not winning, but starting to lose the respect of the country. I want to be wrong, I love our country.

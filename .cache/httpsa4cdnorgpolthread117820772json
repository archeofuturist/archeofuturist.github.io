Bulgaria loses a war or two, and lose some territory again, but the people stay bulgarian. then ww2 comes up. Hitler says kick ass for me and i&#039;ll return macedonia to you. OK! but then hitler attacks russia, so BG says fuck you hitler and they try to be neutral. commies thank BG for being a friend, but pretend it was an enemy and takes it as a satellite at the peace treaty. pic related. San stefano treaty. but then decides that BG is still too big. not cool. They decide to invent a nation called Macedonia. It used to be around there right?

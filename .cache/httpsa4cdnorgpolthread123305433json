As the Cold War developed, the carriers were given specialized missions, such as land-attack or anti-submarine warfare. With shrinking budgets, the DoN decided to move to jack-of-all-trades mega-ships\u2014called super carriers. These would be large enough to carry an air wing that could handle all of the mission sets. As a result, the deck grew to a size commensurate with operating the various aircraft. In fact, they were so large, that operating land-based aircraft was entertained\u2014and thankfully dropped. <br><br>With the catapults in the deck, the ski jump is not just an unnecessary addition, there are serious problems when operating larger, heavier jets. In fact, the Chinese are starting to understand the limitations of the ski jump, as their J-15s are having the same weight troubles as their forefathers, the Russian Su-33. Right now, the J-15 is limited to 4,000 pounds of ordnance when launching from the Liaoning, compared to the Super Hornet&#039;s 12,000 pounds of hurt from the Truman.<br><br>What might be fascinating is to see what engineering would be required to couple an Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System with a ski-jump.

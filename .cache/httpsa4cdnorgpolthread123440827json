In 1947 Rabbinic Jews even protested the formation of Israel, and still torah following Jews criticize the formation of a Jewish state and are persecuted. The dissenting Jews are beaten and jailed in Zionist prisons. Criticizing Israel is always equated to anti-semitism which is fucking annoying. 1) semites refers to a certain group of people indigenous to a small area in the middle east (Arabs, Hebrews 2) Zionists aren&#039;t from this area. They arrived in the 40&#039;s, slaughtered a bunch of actual Semites (Hebrews, Arabs) and proceed to build a wall around Jerusalem and finally after a bunch of Semite slaughtering had their borders completed by 1967 after the 6 day war. The only anti-semites in this fucked up situation are the people supporting Israel and the founders of Israel. I once got told to stop using history as an excuse for my anti-semitism. I simply replied, stop diminishing the rights of torah following Jews for the expansion of Israel and genocide of Palestinians.

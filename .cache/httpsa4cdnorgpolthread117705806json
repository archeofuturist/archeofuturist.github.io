This is a very curious decision on the part of Trump because part of maintaining a gambling license (on which his fortune apparently depended when he was heavily invested in Atlantic City) is scrupulous disassociation from anyone with even hints of criminal activity. Trump was putting his gambling license on the line to hire a felon. Eventually, Weichselbaum is caught redhanded by the DEA with kilos of cocaine as part of the bust of a large distribution ring. Shockingly, Trump further &quot;endangers&quot; his gambling license (not really, of course, as it was protected by virtue of his being a CIA asset) by writing to the court in defense of Weichselbaum,<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;conscientious, forthright, and diligent&quot; and &quot;a credit to the community.&quot;<\/span><br><br>http:\/\/www.thesmokinggun.com\/docume<wbr>nts\/celebrity\/the-donald-and-the-de<wbr>aler-173892","time":1490150715,"resto":117705806,"id":"Funa5guC","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117708838,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)22:45:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117708541\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117708541<\/a><br>Evidence will only help when the countermeasures turn lethal.<br>As in politically lethal.<br><br>If Trump&#039;s administration can prove the whole shebang, I can see them declaring the DNC and the Democrat Party terrorist organisations.<br>Now THAT is something even the most politically inactive will want to know about.","time":1490150716,"resto":117705806,"id":"NquVeBSG","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":117708862,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)22:45:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117708064\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117708064<\/a><br>to further that theory of mine<br><br>how many people think trump is a racist<br><br>COME ON NOW.<br><br>he&#039;s doing the exact same thing obama did<br><br>THAT is how influential the media is.<br><br>If there is tap proof but no collusion proof.

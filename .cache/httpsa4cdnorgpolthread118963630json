For example, Trump promised the Keystone XL pipeline would create 28,000 jobs when he approved the project. But he had to use a huge multiplier to get to even that low number. In fact, it would create about 3,000 temporary construction jobs and only 35 permanent jobs. That&#039;s right: 35 permanent jobs.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;By comparison, in 2016 the number of jobs in solar grew 25% from the year prior, according to figures from the nonprofit Solar Foundation, while jobs in the rest of the economy had less than 2% growth. Renewable energy jobs now create jobs 12 times faster than the rest of the economy. <\/span><br><br>wow, it&#039;s almost like injecting government money into industries that would otherwise not be profitable creates &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;growth&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;","time":1490905942,"resto":118963630,"id":"sGGh43OC","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118964481,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)16:33:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118963630\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118963630<\/a><br>Fuck him, I never liked Erath anyways, he can die for all I care.","time":1490906025,"resto":118963630,"id":"vZa+EfUA","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118965129,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)16:38:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118963630\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118963630<\/a><br><br>we can only hope it turns out that way","time":1490906324,"resto":118963630,"id":"wmarxaMw","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118965512,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)16:41:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118963630\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118963630<\/a><br>Who is Erath?<br>Why should we care about him?","time":1490906498,"resto":118963630,"id":"NtAMJhsj","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118965707,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)16:43:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118963630\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118963630<\/a><br>Who&#039;s Erath, that some kind of reptilian illuminati kike?

I havent been on 4chin for like a year or so and \/pol\/ was the only place i could turn for this question. I was doing some research on this whole multiple gender bs, and i got to thinking, this had to start from one person. I want to know when (other than around 2015 when it started catching on) and who started it. Why did they come up with this &quot;multiple gender&quot; thing? Was it all a big shit post trying to rustle peoples jimmys, was the person\/people who came up with this serious about thinking they classify as something other than male or female? Im not sure, but its peakes my curiosity.

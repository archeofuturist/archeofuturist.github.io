What can I expect while im there? Will the area become a no-go zone before I get there due to escalating riots? Will I get shot by niggers as soon as I get off the plane? What will happen if I wear a MAGA hat out in public? This is my first time travelling.","filename":"Cali","ext":".jpg","w":1700,"h":1129,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1492999608329,"time":1492999608,"md5":"5G730\/jY51rrDoqvRErijQ==","fsize":160250,"resto":0,"id":"jGuWEQ4O","country":"AU","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"ausfaggot-here-going-to-cali-in-a-couple-months","country_name":"Australia","replies":13,"images":4,"unique_ips":9},{"no":122526640,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)22:07:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"\/trv\/\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;&gt;\/trv\/<\/a>","time":1492999672,"resto":122526530,"id":"+eGcQzAW","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122526673,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)22:08:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122526530\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122526530<\/a><br>Crazy world, I&#039;m a califag going to Ausland in a couple month.

Every other city is safe enough. I live in one of the safest cities, but the murder rate here is all niggers killing each other so If you stay away from nigger towns, you&#039;ll be fine. Also if you say or wear maga shit then people will call you a fucking idiot. I nearly bitch slapped some faggot in front of his ugly girlfriend when he called my friend a fucking idiot but he just walked away without looking at us so just don&#039;t give a fuck what fags here think of you.","time":1492999883,"resto":122526530,"id":"hysRx2su","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122527313,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)22:14:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122526530\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122526530<\/a><br>LOTS AND LOTS AND LOTS AND LOTS AND LOTS of BUMS and crazy lunatic drug addicts in the downtown area mostly, but YOU WILL see them all around the city, other than that its really nice with lots of places to check out within an hour driving distance.

I&#039;ve been to a few punk rock shows at the burnt ramen venue out there. You wanna see hoods? Drive through Oakland in the day time. You wanna see rich cities? Go to east bay.

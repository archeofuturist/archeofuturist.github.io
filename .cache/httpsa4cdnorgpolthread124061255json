But I find myself increasingly more unable to enjoy movies and tv shows without getting turned off by anti conservative undertones. I can&#039;t watch &quot;shameless&quot; because of the socioeconomic implications of normalizing their behavior through comedy. I can&#039;t watch planet of the apes because the director boasted of his ability to convince people through movies that guns are bad.

We can&#039;t win people to our way of thinking if we are considered cooks and tin foilers by those we wish to influence. Do any normies have any advice for me?

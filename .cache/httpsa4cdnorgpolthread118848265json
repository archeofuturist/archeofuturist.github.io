The difference between LA and NY is that LA comics tend to be personalities and NY comics tend to be writers. My tastes tend to prefer NY style more, but obviously only the not SJW faggots.

I don&#039;t really like comedians who talk about politics though because most of them aren&#039;t very politically knowledgeable. People confuse their ability to ridicule something as having prowess on the subject. Atheists can run Christianity into the ground by making fun of it but you put them in a debate with a person who studies Christianity, the philosophy, and its arguments and they look like children. It&#039;s like that time Jim Jeffries was on Bill Mahr&#039;s show and his only response to the claim that trump isn&#039;t literally hitler was to scream &quot;oh fuck off fuck off fuck off!&quot;.","time":1490830861,"resto":118848265,"id":"gWyydVZI","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118852416,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)19:47:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"He&#039;s very fair in his opinions and I feel like I could bullshit with him over a beer.

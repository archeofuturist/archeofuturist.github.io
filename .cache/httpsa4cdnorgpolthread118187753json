Within a week, the House of Representatives could follow suit, and the rules approved by the Federal Communications Commission last year would be eliminated by Congress.<br><br>~~~~~~<br><br>Find your REPRESENTATIVE here and SEND THEM AN E-MAIL EXPRESSING YOUR DISSENT<br>http:\/\/www.house.gov\/representative<wbr>s\/find\/<br><br>Here is a sample e-mail. I will post some more in the replies below.<br><br>~~~~~~<br><br>Dear Representative,<br><br>Please do not bow down to special interests and vote NAY on the Joint Resolution (S.J. Res. 34). We the PEOPLE do not want to have our internet histories up for sale to the highest bidder, as not only is that a grotesque invasion of privacy on the level of an Orwellian society, but also an opportunity for corporations to grow more uncontrollable. How would you like it if someone was selling your browsing history to others, Representative?

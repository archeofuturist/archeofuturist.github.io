Mind you 90% of the time he spoke he utilized a Teleprompter like most politicians, but I&#039;ll give it to him Obama is literally the king of a equivocation and pontification. There is no one better at getting idiots to believe in bullshit just by being a skilled orator.<br><br> Forget about his $3 billion slush fund to interfere in a election, Forget about him adding more to the national debt than any other president in history and despite that being the fourth worst presidency in terms of economic growth...almost $10 trillion in debt and nothing to show for it, not even a half decent economy; Bush had a better economic growth. But guess what he speaks well so it&#039;s all good.","filename":"IMG_1334","ext":".jpg","w":419,"h":275,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":82,"tim":1491811717311,"time":1491811717,"md5":"7aKxnDdV2XnKhAFr\/LMxOw==","fsize":24055,"resto":120408597,"id":"T0uMeKoK","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120412080,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)04:08:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120411367\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120411367<\/a><br>shooped","time":1491811732,"resto":120408597,"id":"6ra+YYPw","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120412130,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)04:09:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120411927\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120411927<\/a><br><br>wtf I love circumcised cock in my mouth now","time":1491811773,"resto":120408597,"id":"cPc8cc7\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120412152,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)04:09:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"Daily reminder you&#039;re a mentally ill socially alienated manchild who has grasped onto Trump and this whole jr high neo-nazism called the alt-right because you&#039;re a pathetic excuse for a man who just wanted to feel like he belongs and to lie to himself and tell himself he&#039;s special.

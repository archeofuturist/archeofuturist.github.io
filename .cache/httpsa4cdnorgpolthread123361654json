Only shampoo is fine, or maybe one of those shampoo\/conditioner combination. <br><br>If its TOO oily, or maybe if your hair is too thin and you&#039;d wish for more volume, you can use soap. You should try around with those options, and if you feel your hair has gotten too dry, you should wash it with shampoo again, maybe even conditioner once a week to hydrate it again.<br><br>If your hair is too dry, just do the opposite, and wash it with shampoo and conditioner.<br><br>You should know what&#039;s the difference between all of them. Both the shampoo and the soap are there to get rid of the excess of oil on your hair. Of course, the shampoo is made specifically to be less &quot;damaging&quot; to the average hair than the soap, but their function is the same. The conditioner is a kind of &quot;grease&quot; that insulates your hair so it wont electrically repeal itself, it also hydrates your scalp. <br><br>But why would you wash your hair if you don&#039;t want to get rid of the natural oils? Because disgusting polluent and dust and dirty shit get&#039;s stuck on your oily hair. You should wash this off, and if you feel the need to replace the oil you should put on conditioner. This is hygiene. You don&#039;t have to wash it everyday if it&#039;s fucking your scalp.<br><br>Also, if your scalp is all fucked up and disgusting, it may or may not be the shampoo. You might be washing your hair with water too hot. You could be not washing it properly or even scratching your scalp too hard while showering.

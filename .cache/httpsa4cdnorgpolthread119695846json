I don&#039;t hate Trump but I also don&#039;t like him, not because I don&#039;t agree with his views but because I simply don&#039;t know the guy. Or shit about politics. Enlighten me a little bit on this Nuclear War with North Korea? Also if any of you could share true conspiracy theories or credible or non credible stuff this man has said I would really appreciate it. I&#039;m still lost about where I should get my news from.","filename":"infowars","ext":".jpg","w":512,"h":512,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491447885186,"time":1491447885,"md5":"lqFYm4oDnqhzrl4usbZd9Q==","fsize":32796,"resto":0,"id":"lwvsedip","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"be-18","country_name":"United States","replies":9,"images":4,"unique_ips":8},{"no":119695984,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)23:05:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"I&#039;ve never taken Politics seriously* not history sorry about that","time":1491447953,"resto":119695846,"id":"lwvsedip","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119696015,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)23:06:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"Alex Jones&#039; great, senpai.","filename":"541","ext":".jpg","w":623,"h":350,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1491447969688,"time":1491447969,"md5":"CCzQZ49dNpB4tqTMpdtwIg==","fsize":32929,"resto":119695846,"id":"d+pyCDP\/","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119696223,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)23:08:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"He&#039;s controlled opposition.

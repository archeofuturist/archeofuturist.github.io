The romans saw direct threats to the north, east and west, and what did they do? Invade, and convert those under their rule. Right across the border from Texas are some of the most violent and barbaric cities in North America, if the USA was a half decent empire we would have invaded, killed the barbarians and converted the rest to our culture. How great would all of NA be if we controlled mexico, cuba, haiti, DR, and every other island in the gulf of mexico? Pretty damn great. Also we should probably start some colonies in Afrika, Asia, and the Middle East. A truly international empire.","filename":"1492111117061","ext":".png","w":1024,"h":940,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":114,"tim":1492526112778,"time":1492526112,"md5":"\/KXOuXrh5eS2gyRBuwGTbw==","fsize":103746,"resto":121689945,"id":"oXWGd+Or","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121690889,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)10:35:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121689945\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121689945<\/a><br>No.","time":1492526133,"resto":121689945,"id":"1Ack0ney","country":"MX","country_name":"Mexico"},{"no":121691091,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)10:37:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121689945\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121689945<\/a><br>We are too nice to be honest.

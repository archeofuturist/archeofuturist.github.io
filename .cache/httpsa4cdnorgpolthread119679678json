Are we actually nostalgic of better times? Is the SJW culture war a reality, or blinded negligence? <br><br>There&#039;s a constant state of dystopia in my mind. I feel like I&#039;m constantly being presented with pathed choices. A life of materialism and consensus or one entirely absolved from both. <br><br>Must we make a choice? Are we really at a barrier? A cut off point seems an inevitability. A cultural war on our doorstep; the West must either make a stand - against degeneracy, against Islam, against degradation of our fine culture. <br><br>Or is this all in my head? Has this website and others created a false sense of reality? Or has the hypernormalisation set in for so many, that they can no longer see the path of enlightenment from the trees of decadence engulfing it. <br><br>I look around and all I see is eternal doom for the children of Europe. This is beyond the notion of a redpill. I&#039;ve been here for what seems a lifetime. This is ontology. <br><br>If you tell me it isn&#039;t how it is, I must face the reality that I&#039;m going crazy. If I&#039;m not, then everyone else is. I don&#039;t know which truth is harder to swallow.","filename":"protest-5","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":333,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1491438703400,"time":1491438703,"md5":"0JxKlLCUUXbOPhN7iCigAg==","fsize":61771,"resto":0,"id":"96xdfCyU","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"does-anyone-else-constantly-question-their-state","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":1,"images":1,"unique_ips":1},{"no":119680471,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)20:38:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"see: Mencken","filename":"1393101327077","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":385,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":96,"tim":1491439111690,"time":1491439111,"md5":"FK7DsjphODPHhraYz9jq6A==","fsize":79627,"resto":119679678,"id":"96xdfCyU","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"}]}

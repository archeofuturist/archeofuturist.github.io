I also included a note about the alleged rift between Bannon and Kushner, saying that Trump&#039;s base feels Bannon understands our interests best and feels that Kushner is not on the same page as us. I literally used the phrase &quot;not on the same page as us.&quot;<br>Probably a coincide, but... did someone actually read my message and take it to heart?<br>This is the second time something like that happened. The other time was when shills were going nuts here after the healthcare fiasco, and also spamming about Russia. So I spammed them back with some embarassing wikileaks e-mails and also brought up Uranium One, which nobody had been talking about in a while. The next day Trump put out a tweet about Podesta and the Uranium One deal.

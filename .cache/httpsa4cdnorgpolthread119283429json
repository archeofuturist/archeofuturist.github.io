I would say not to worry about it.<br>For example, my grandfather was white with green eyes but if he took a DNA test he would show up with a fair amount of MENA percentage points. The reason is the Canary Islands used to be inhabited by a proto-white green eyed people called the guanches who cane from a similar genetic father as berbers. When they read these genes today, they mistake them for being North African in origin (many people thinking that equals moors) instead of the way it is.","time":1491190392,"resto":119283429,"id":"ts55d6bg","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

Any goys wanna throw in some ammo? It&#039;ll be really appreciated. A couple other students in the class have show glimpses of the importance of Ethnic Nationalism and I want them to feel comfortable coming out of their shells onto the good side","filename":"534","ext":".jpg","w":501,"h":585,"tn_w":214,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491442607804,"time":1491442607,"md5":"+CPHEh00EifLEFfXLMiiCw==","fsize":47072,"resto":0,"id":"ITYW+YV4","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"mussy-euro-college-debate","country_name":"United States","replies":3,"images":1,"unique_ips":3},{"no":119687986,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)21:47:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"What is Germany without Germans? Sweden without Swedes? Italy without Italians, Britain without Britons, France without the French? People should recognize if they are foreigners in a country, not undermine the culture. Europeans cannot be allowed to become a minority within their own countries as it ruins the culture and eliminates them from existence. Diversity should be expressed with countries having their own people with their own culture. Otherwise, every place in the world is the same. That&#039;s not diversity. That doesn&#039;t give many cultures to an area, it mixes it all until it turns until a uniform blob. People ought to be proud of their heritage, not ashamed, and while countries in aid need help, they should rather build safe areas within other muslim countries that share a similar cultural identity than bringing them on to mainland Europe and calling them Europeans. The Muslim Immigration Crisis can be easily solved by having our partners in the Middle East help by building safe zones in Syria and by helping share the workload, with us helping economically in the region. This is a simple solution to allow European culture to exist and thrived as it has for hundreds of years while still giving humanitarian aid to the Middle East.<br>Write something along these lines for your debate.","time":1491443254,"resto":119686849,"id":"eFu2JPrE","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119688089,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)21:48:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119686849\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119686849<\/a><br>Do this","filename":"1489028569321","ext":".png","w":730,"h":600,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":102,"tim":1491443310903,"time":1491443310,"md5":"67QuXWusiZGwV3DLtdd9Tg==","fsize":116377,"resto":119686849,"id":"5abkjYKl","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119690126,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)22:09:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119687986\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119687986<\/a><br>Thats general idea I am targeting for my points thus far.

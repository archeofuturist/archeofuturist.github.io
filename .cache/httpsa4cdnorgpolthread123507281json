Obviously it offends me if someone includes me in a list of white socialists who don\u2019t care about race or something like that. These people who accuse me of being white, I want to know where they were when I was detained at the airport or harassed after 9\/11. It would\u2019ve been nice to have them there to say \u201cOh, don\u2019t worry about him, he\u2019s a Marxist so we consider him white.\u201d But that didn\u2019t happen. Despite the fact that identity politics is supposed to be about everyone\u2019s experiences, it completely erases my own experiences of racism and it distorts the views I\u2019ve formed to understand those experiences.<\/span>","time":1493577073,"resto":123507281,"id":"n6bybTmK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123507481,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)14:32:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"Marxists have always been critical of identity politics.

He figured out a long time ago that he needed to actually read as much as he could on the subjects he was interested in (which he did by getting the books on them from the people who worked in the fields), and then he went about using all of his employees as brain dumps. He also has perfect recall and won&#039;t accept a reason for why something can&#039;t be done unless you can prove it would be actually impossible. The way he structures SpaceX to function is that he puts all of the Supervisors and Managers of the engineering groups to work on certain projects and then demands certain time-tables, and benchmarks to be hit. With a guy like Jobs you could just say some stuff and that would be the reason why something couldn&#039;t be done. Elon meanwhile knows everything about what you&#039;re going to work on already, and if you can&#039;t meet the demands or rather, can&#039;t justify why you can&#039;t, he will fire you on the spot and take your job. According to one former employee at SpaceX he saw Elon do this multiple times and then go on and get the job done.","time":1492439584,"resto":121530254,"id":"OPj+yJcj","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121532017,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)10:33:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121531820\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121531820<\/a><br>look it says Submitting false reports will result in a ban.","time":1492439616,"resto":121530254,"id":"noVjZ4Zh","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":121532141,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)10:34:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121531874\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121531874<\/a><br>That&#039;s fine, at least then they wont go extinct<br><br>You actually from Swazi or just poaching?","time":1492439691,"resto":121530254,"id":"WjaeXAdY","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":121532212,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)10:35:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121531874\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121531874<\/a><br><br>Other poachers will still kill them, REEE.","time":1492439735,"resto":121530254,"id":"OPj+yJcj","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121532240,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)10:35:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121531956\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121531956<\/a><br>well, that sounds good then. i had a false picture of him.<br><br><a href=\"#p121532017\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121532017<\/a><br>no shit","time":1492439753,"resto":121530254,"id":"d1C2cuwx","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":121532367,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)10:36:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121532017\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121532017<\/a><br>Fuck of autist","time":1492439817,"resto":121530254,"id":"YF45SjjI","country":"ZA","country_name":"South Africa"},{"no":121532434,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)10:37:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121532141\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121532141<\/a><br>South african trying to get my family the fuck out","time":1492439854,"resto":121530254,"id":"uGkEgcm6","country":"SZ","country_name":"Swaziland"},{"no":121532491,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)10:38:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121532367\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121532367<\/a><br>I was going to insult you back but then I saw your flag and now I feel sorry for you","time":1492439888,"resto":121530254,"id":"noVjZ4Zh","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":121532589,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)10:38:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121530438\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121530438<\/a><br>ULTRA<br>A<br>R<br>E","time":1492439938,"resto":121530254,"id":"N2j\/FB6Q","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121532672,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)10:39:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121532141\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121532141<\/a><br>Fine until you realize the white mans way of poaching is making the animals heart stop with an overdose of sedatives\/ <br><br><a href=\"#p121531874\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121531874<\/a><br>Scum","time":1492439977,"resto":121530254,"id":"YF45SjjI","country":"ZA","country_name":"South Africa"},{"no":121532789,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)10:40:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121532672\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121532672<\/a><br>Fuck off nigger im not having my family die at the hands of zealous subhumans high on blakkk power","time":1492440038,"resto":121530254,"id":"uGkEgcm6","country":"SZ","country_name":"Swaziland"},{"no":121532904,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)10:41:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;be &quot;Elon Musk&quot;<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;deported from planet mars for reasons we don&#039;t know<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;he&#039;s angry and wants to take revenge<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;arrives on earth<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;make a lot money due to his alien knowledge<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;launches space program<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;wants to &quot;colonize&quot;

Musk knows, and has known since 2013 that Tesla is worth too much money. Like, way too much money, it&#039;s why he has been dumping stock from it like a madman. He used to own over 75% of it, now he only owns 22.5% (or it might be 25%). Simply because he knows he can still maintain a controlling interest when the stock tanks, or buy up enough shares to regain it once the value hemorrhages. He also treats Tesla as a side-project. It&#039;s a means to make money for him (he actually admitted this last year), and that the only thing he cares about is getting to Mars. <br><br>I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if in a few years he sold his controlling interest in Tesla, or Tesla itself outright to Panasonic or VW or GM. They already have teams dedicated to studying everything he does, which is as insane as it sounds. So do multiple investment firms.

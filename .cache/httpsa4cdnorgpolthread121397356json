They are aware that they have been made culturally and economically irrelevant <br> - with globalization perpetually pushing wages down and automation just around the corner to leave them entirely separate from modern American life. However, for cultural reasons, they are unable to develop healthy responses to their situations, so they dive deeper into the rabbit hole of reactionary politics. <br><br>By joining a militia, they can pretend they&#039;re someone other than destined to a lifetime of minimum wage and disrespect from shitty college kids (who secretly want everyone in the flyover states dead anyway). Instead - they can invent themselves the noble defenders of civilization by making the entirely unnecessary &quot;sacrifice&quot; of spending on weapons they will never use and operations that help no one. Although they claim to do this for society&#039;s benefit, in reality it only props up their own egos. <br><br>At its most benign, this behavior simply wastes public resources when law enforcement must babysit them to prevent violence. However, this anti-social roleplay always morphs into violent power fantasies - usually directed against those who typically produce the slights, real or imagined, that drive otherwise sane white men to join militias: women and racial or religious minorities. These unhealthy fantasies are ticking time bombs, waiting to explode into terrible violence.<br><br>Literally every cent these people spend on LARPing would be better spent attending community college, raising a family, investing in a business, or pursuing technical training.<br><br>What have you done to discourage the militia movement today, \/pol\/?

I can tell them about my background in the militia movement: Before joining the Three Percent United Patriots (3UP) for this border operation, I trained with the California State Militia and the 31st Defense Legion across northern and central California. I learned marksmanship, land navigation, patrolling skills, rappelling, radio communication, code language, how to set up an FOB in a hostile situation, and how to hold defensive positions. Like the other guys, I adopt a call sign to protect my identity. In California, some knew me as Rattlesnake.

I used my real name, but the only personal information I divulged on my profile was that I was married and that I had held jobs as a welder and a prison guard for the Corrections Corporation of America. A &quot;Don&#039;t Tread on Me&quot; flag was my avatar. I found and &quot;liked&quot; militia pages: Three Percenter Nation, Patriotic Warriors, Arizona State Militia. Then Facebook generated endless suggestions of other militia pages, and I &quot;liked&quot; those too. To keep my page active, I shared other people&#039;s posts: blogs about President Barack Obama trying to declare martial law, and threats of Syrians crossing the border. I posted memes about American flags and police lives mattering. Then I sent dozens of friend requests to people who belonged to militia-related Facebook groups. Some were suspicious of me: &quot;Kinda have a veg profile, so I got to ask why you want to be my friend????&quot; one messaged. Many, however, accepted my friend requests automatically. Within a couple of days, I had more than 100 friends, and virtually any militia member who looked at my page would likely find that we had at least one friend in common.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Then I came across the Three Percent United Patriots&#039; private &quot;Operation Spring Break&quot; Facebook group. I requested access, and when it was granted I saw a post asking who was coming to the operation in April. I replied, &quot;Yes.&quot; The purpose of the operation wasn&#039;t posted anywhere because it was understood implicitly\u2014to catch illegal immigrants and drug smugglers. Eventually, the coordinates for the forward operating base inside Arizona&#039;s San Rafael Ranch State Park were posted. No one asked me anything about myself. All I had to do was show up. The list of required equipment was extensive, including weapons, medical supplies, and body cameras. The idea was that video footage would disprove anyone making false accusations against the militiamen.<\/span>","time":1492369645,"resto":121397356,"id":"W0JbF+jU","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121398474,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)15:08:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121398369\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121398369<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; I used my body cam to capture what I saw and heard. No one raised an eyebrow.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Members of 3UP view their border operations as an opportunity to serve the nation while putting their training to the test and honing their skills for the battle to come. Like most militiamen, they believe societal collapse is imminent. There are many theories about what will make the &quot;Shit Hit The Fan.&quot; Some believe it will be economic collapse. It could be civil unrest provoked by Black Lives Matter. It could be a natural disaster. It could be a government attempt to disarm gun owners and impose martial law. While many in the broader &quot;patriot&quot; movement prepare for that day to arrive, members of 3UP see themselves as men of action, sheepdogs in a nation of blind, ignorant sheep.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; As we approach the FOB on our way back from Walmart, Captain Pain radios in our arrival. This is protocol for anyone coming or going. Two men are patrolling the perimeter with AR-15s, and if we don&#039;t announce ourselves, they might mistake us for bad guys. These are not the only security measures: I&#039;m told there are motion sensors in the dry riverbed that flanks the base, men sometimes take positions on surrounding hilltops, and most meals are prepared with bacon grease or pork to keep would-be Muslim infiltrators at bay.<\/span>","time":1492369690,"resto":121397356,"id":"W0JbF+jU","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121398543,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)15:08:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121398369\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121398369<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; It&#039;s midday and men are sitting around playing cards, staring at empty fire pits, and napping in their tents. More than 40 people have come here from Arizona, Colorado, Texas, Tennessee, Alabama, North Carolina, and other states. Almost all are white, but there are one or two Latinos. They are roofers, electricians, heavy-equipment operators, welders, a prison nurse, and a bounty hunter. Most of the men are militia infantry like me, but others have more specialized roles. Blackfin controls shortwave radio communications from a camper with a tall antenna sticking out of its roof and a generator humming at its side. A man from Oregon cooks breakfast and dinner under a large kitchen tent. The camp medic, Rogue, sits under the medical tent, staring into his cellphone. Some of the men grumble about a local TV news crew from Alabama that&#039;s filming around the base and nearly foiled one of the nighttime ops by switching on a light near the border fence.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; A modified American flag hangs motionless from a gnarled mesquite tree, its canton of 50 stars replaced with a Roman numeral III surrounded by 13 stars.

Vanderboegh said three percenters were &quot;willing to fight, die and, if forced by any would-be oppressor, to kill&quot; to defend the Constitution.<\/span>","time":1492369727,"resto":121397356,"id":"W0JbF+jU","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121398621,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)15:09:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121398543\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121398543<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; The three percenter philosophy has quickly grown into a grassroots, national movement, part of a resurgence of right-wing militia activity following Obama&#039;s election in 2008.

He doesn&#039;t think 3UP is going to stop drug smuggling or illegal immigration with these operations, but he feels they are a chance for patriots to serve their country. He doesn&#039;t even think immigration is the main concern. The real problem is that America has become unrecognizable: The federal government has become tyrannical and the country&#039;s customs and culture are being destroyed. &quot;We lose more and more rights, more and more freedom, every day,&quot; Fifty Cal told me when I called him after the border op. (I attempted to contact all the militia members mentioned in this article. A few agreed to talk on the record.) He said 3UP isn&#039;t &quot;all about guns and camo.&quot; It has done relief work in response to the water crisis in Flint, Michigan, and floods in Louisiana and South Carolina.

Jaeger says he&#039;ll be voting for Gary Johnson, the Libertarian candidate. Ghost, however, supports Donald Trump. He tells us he&#039;s worried about the day when ISIS integrates with the cartels and starts hopping over the four-foot border fence just south of here. Until Trump is president, Ghost says, we are the wall.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; The guys just can&#039;t believe how many Muslims there are in the country today. &quot;Saudi fucking Aurora is what it is,&quot; Captain Pain says of his hometown in Colorado. &quot;We need to kill more of those motherfuckers.

People like him with an honest trade used to be comfortable. And he didn&#039;t hear people complaining about white men all the time like they do now. Everyone&#039;s become so uptight. It wasn&#039;t like that when he was young, living in Los Angeles, cruising up Hollywood Boulevard with his buddies. &quot;We&#039;d fuck with the hookers,&quot; hanging a $20 bill out the window and watching them chase the car. &quot;Actually, there were some damn good-looking hookers compared to East Aurora. Big old fat nigger wandering around: &#039;Come here, baby!&#039;&quot; he shouts mockingly. &quot;No! Get the fuck back! There ain&#039;t enough booze in the world, woman.&quot; He lets the N-word slip sometimes, even though it seems to make some of the guys a little uncomfortable. Fifty Cal later told me that racism isn&#039;t tolerated and that &quot;We have removed and blocked folks that didn&#039;t align with our ideals.&quot; In its official communications, 3UP insists it is not a white supremacist organization. No one ever speaks up at this kind of language, though. To show offense would be to give in to political correctness, which is a step toward Big Brother mind control.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Ghost says America&#039;s sense of history has gone down an &quot;Orwellian memory hole.&quot; Who remembers Randy Weaver anymore? Ghost was 25 years old in 1991, when Weaver, a member of the white supremacist Christian Identity movement who&#039;d been charged with selling sawed-off shotguns, holed up with his family in their cabin in Ruby Ridge, Idaho, for 18 months. A shootout ensued, and a federal deputy and Weaver&#039;s 13-year-old son were killed. During the 10-day siege that followed, an FBI sniper killed Weaver&#039;s wife as she held their baby. Ghost is convinced that Weaver&#039;s real crime was distrusting the government.<\/span>","time":1492369922,"resto":121397356,"id":"W0JbF+jU","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121399017,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)15:12:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121398930\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121398930<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; To Ghost and other patriots, Ruby Ridge remains a sign that the government is willing to go to war against its citizens. A year after Ruby Ridge came the siege of the Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Texas, where cultists had been stockpiling weapons and more than 1 million rounds of ammunition. The FBI eventually assaulted the compound, resulting in a blaze that killed more than 70 men, women, and children. The rumor that the feds intentionally set the fire persists among far-right groups and conspiracy peddlers like Alex Jones. The 1994 federal assault weapons ban solidified patriots&#039; belief that Washington was making final preparations to turn America into a totalitarian state. By the mid-&#039;90s, hundreds of paramilitary groups had formed across the country, styling themselves as &quot;militias&quot; to invoke the volunteers who&#039;d fought in the American Revolution.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; The 1995 Oklahoma City bombing sparked a backlash against the anti-government extremism that had spawned Timothy McVeigh. The militia movement effectively went dormant following the election of George W. Bush in 2000. Then came the first black president. In the three years after Obama took office, the number of active militias in the United States increased eightfold, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center. By 2015, there were more than 275 groups in at least 41 states.<\/span>","time":1492369959,"resto":121397356,"id":"W0JbF+jU","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121399080,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)15:13:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121399017\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121399017<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; The movement is bound together by a shared disdain for the federal government, but individual members&#039; motivations for joining can vary widely. &quot;We all have different reasons to be here,&quot; Captain Clyde Massengale of the California State Militia&#039;s Delta Company told the new recruits at my first training. &quot;Some might believe what is happening is something biblical right now. Some might believe it&#039;s the New World Order. Some might believe the New World Order is making what is happening follow the Bible. Who the fuck knows? Who the fuck cares?&quot; Come what may, the militia would be ready. When shit hit the fan, it would have a secret, fortified bugout location where we could bring our families. A new community might someday need to be built there. Massengale said that under his command, life in the bugout would be modeled after ancient Rome. Active, patched members of the California State Militia would be considered citizens, while lapsed members and outsiders would not. &quot;We need worker bees,&quot; he said. &quot;You wanna come in? We&#039;ll bring you in. You&#039;ll be down in the field growing food, gathering wood. We&#039;ll be the ones standing watch,&quot; he said. Then he added in a loud whisper, &quot;In the houses, not in the tents. Hahahaha!&quot;<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; I looked to the one black man in the group, a recruit who had family near the mass shooting in San Bernardino a week earlier. &quot;I hate to tell you, but I&#039;m in for the long count,&quot; he told the captain. &quot;So you&#039;ll be seeing my black ass here every time.&quot;<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; The captain responded that in his experience, black people were always the best at learning and executing orders. &quot;We need to see some more black asses, is what we need,&quot; he said.

He has 200. &quot;I&#039;ll probably never need all that,&quot; he says. &quot;However, we get out there, say we catch a group of about six or seven going south\u2014&quot; He suddenly stiffens to strike a pose.

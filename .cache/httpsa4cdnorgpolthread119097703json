I have no real sources most of this is just what i&#039;ve heard from family members. I have several relatives in Venezuelan government positions. Maybe some of you can find additional information.<br><br>Back in 2015 Obama used executive powers to freeze the bank accounts of venezuelan officials citing human rights violations. This was just what was reported according to my sources many more than 7 people had assets frozen. The issue was that much of the money looked illegitimate. For example a customs official who makes 30 thousand a year with 20 million is a US bank account. Hard to justify where your money come from. Upon having their nest eggs taken many officials started stealing wholesale. The soldiers would meet ships at the port and take half of all the good to sell in Colombia. You can imagine if you are living a millionaire&#039;s lifestyle you have bills to pay, stealing was the only way to recoup their money fast. Compound on top of that the anemic venezuelan economy and the low price of oil, and the country started to shut down. Empty grocery shelves led to hoarding and now you have to stand in line for everything. Brownouts are still common and for a while in 2016 the country was on a 2 day work week to conserve electricity. <br><br>Recently VP El Assami has had $3 billion in assets frozen for alleged drug trafficking. He admits his assets were frozen but denies that it was $3 billion.<br><br>What do you think of the Venezuelan VP having his assets frozen? <br>Anybody know anything else about Venezuelan corruption?<br><br>https:\/\/panampost.com\/panam-staff\/2<wbr>017\/03\/27\/us-treasury-froze-us-3-bi<wbr>llion-in-assets-of-venezuelas-vicep<wbr>resident-for-drug-traficking\/<br><br>https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2015\/03\/10\/<wbr>world\/americas\/obama-freezes-assets<wbr>-of-seven-venezuelan-officials.html<wbr>","filename":"796dbae28c96a272d3e43876f879e47fefe1313cedddd53d749645a0ec20c096_1-1","ext":".jpg","w":598,"h":395,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":165,"tim":1490993014211,"time":1490993014,"md5":"KzbWx3ATlw572uyQDO83tw==","fsize":64940,"resto":0,"id":"Hy4K\/I8\/","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"venezuela","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":119098129,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)16:48:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119097703\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119097703<\/a><br>How about you stayed and fight the goverment you pussy.","time":1490993289,"resto":119097703,"id":"8CQRmYg9","country":"VE","country_name":"Venezuela"}]}

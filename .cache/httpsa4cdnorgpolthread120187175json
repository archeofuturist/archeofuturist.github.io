McMaster&#039;s right hand woman. <\/span><br><br>The removal of Bannon might be coming because of disagreements and infighting between him and (((Kushner))), and since Kushner is Trump&#039;s son in law, of course he will side with him and not Bannon. This battered got it all figured out. <br>We need to expose Kushner and show Trump the truth, and make sure Bannon stays. <br><br>Idea: Trump cut all of his affiliation with his companies, which he gave to his children. What if we campaign for Kushner to do the same; We make him get rid of his affiliation with the Kushner companies so he will not have any &quot;corporate interest&quot; in the foreign policy he advises on. That way he has to either fuck off and keep his shit, or stay and literally just be a useless puppet that does nothing or very little. <br><br><br>After (((Kushner))) is disabled, Gary Cohn and Dina Powell are next, the are bad business, Gary is the economic advisor, bad position, Dina is on the security council and might be promoted to be McMaster&#039;s assistant on national security, which is even worse given the context that the globalists want to pull another Iraq. <br><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;inb4 kike btfo<\/span>","filename":"1491685200768","ext":".jpg","w":782,"h":960,"tn_w":203,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491687766919,"time":1491687766,"md5":"SPghAa8zvyuo0w7TB25ONQ==","fsize":83123,"resto":0,"id":"4m\/EU2FB","country":"IL","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"there-are-some-rumors-that-trump-might-cure","country_name":"Israel","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

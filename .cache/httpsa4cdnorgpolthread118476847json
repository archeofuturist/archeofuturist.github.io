It also justifies as to why the crown should be passed on to your heir and not some random very smart individual. <br><br>This wasn&#039;t just the case in China, but in every country that had someone in absolute control. Even Lenin and Stalin, while not monarchs, were given divine attributes as a part of their cult of personality. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Why should anyone follow a president&#039;s rule? The monarch is there to be the best person for the job.<\/span><br><br>Because you agreed to follow the President&#039;s orders if the order is a lawful one. That last bit is important: the order has to be lawful. If the president wakes up one day and tells you to kill everyone who opposes him, that wouldn&#039;t be a lawful order so the courts would restrain the President. Nobody can really restrain an insane order given by a monarch because they are believed to have special, divine powers.","time":1490599580,"resto":118476847,"id":"R0Hyz8vs","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118486385,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)03:26:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118476847\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118476847<\/a><br>If you&#039;re a filthy monarchies why don&#039;t you fuck off to England or some other monarchies shithole?","time":1490599590,"resto":118476847,"id":"kfT5kO9K","country":"BG","country_name":"Bulgaria"},{"no":118486525,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)03:28:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118476847\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118476847<\/a><br>Screw you guy!","filename":"south-park-cartman-2-810x692","ext":".jpg","w":810,"h":692,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":106,"tim":1490599726664,"time":1490599726,"md5":"WMxT4iD11\/HjK5zBgYXNwg==","fsize":76040,"resto":118476847,"id":"L6949kaC","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118486571,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)03:29:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118486271\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118486271<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Yea, they branded them rebels first.

If this is overdone, or if a particular child is<br> especially susceptible to such feelings, he ends by feeling ashamed of<br> HIMSELF. Moreover the thought and the behavior of the oversocialized<br> person are more restricted by society&#039;s expectations than are those of<br> the lightly socialized person. The majority of people engage in a<br> significant amount of naughty behavior. They lie, they commit petty<br> thefts, they break traffic laws, they goof off at work, they hate<br> someone, they say spiteful things or they use some underhanded trick<br> to get ahead of the other guy. The oversocialized person cannot do<br> these things, or if he does do them he generates in himself a sense of<br> shame and self-hatred. The oversocialized person cannot even<br> experience, without guilt, thoughts or feelings that are contrary to<br> the accepted morality; he cannot think &quot;unclean&quot; thoughts. And<br> socialization is not just a matter of morality; we are socialized to<br> confirm to many norms of behavior that do not fall under the heading<br> of morality. Thus the oversocialized person is kept on a psychological<br> leash and spends his life running on rails that society has laid down<br> for him. In many oversocialized people this results in a sense of<br> constraint and powerlessness that can be a severe hardship. We suggest<br> that oversocialization is among the more serious cruelties that human<br> beings inflict on one another.","time":1493309297,"resto":123046988,"id":"Yoh0Ffcu","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":123051653,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)12:09:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123046988\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123046988<\/a><br>Didn&#039;t Anders Breivik (PBUH) copy a lot of his own manifesto directly from the Unabomber&#039;s?<br><br>Kaczynski is like proto-\/pol\/.","time":1493309343,"resto":123046988,"id":"xfNfgI8Y","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123051872,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)12:11:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123048319\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123048319<\/a><br>I read the Manifesto when it first came out.

Each student had previously written an essay detailing their personal beliefs and aspirations: the essays were turned over to an anonymous attorney, who would enter the room and individually belittle each student based in part on the disclosures they had made. This was filmed, and students&#039; expressions of impotent rage were played back to them several times later in the study. According to author Alston Chase, Kaczynski&#039;s records from that period suggest he was emotionally stable when the study began. Kaczynski&#039;s lawyers attributed some of his emotional instability and dislike of mind control techniques to his participation in this study.[16] Furthermore, some have suggested that this experience may have been instrumental in Kaczynski&#039;s future actions.[17][18]<\/span><br><br>All of that is just from public, baseline declassified MK-ULTRA papers, which absolved anyone involved, including sick fucks like George White and Sydney &quot;Black Sorcerer&quot; Gottlieb.

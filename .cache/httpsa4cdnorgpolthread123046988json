If this is overdone, or if a particular child is<br> especially susceptible to such feelings, he ends by feeling ashamed of<br> HIMSELF. Moreover the thought and the behavior of the oversocialized<br> person are more restricted by society&#039;s expectations than are those of<br> the lightly socialized person. The majority of people engage in a<br> significant amount of naughty behavior. They lie, they commit petty<br> thefts, they break traffic laws, they goof off at work, they hate<br> someone, they say spiteful things or they use some underhanded trick<br> to get ahead of the other guy. The oversocialized person cannot do<br> these things, or if he does do them he generates in himself a sense of<br> shame and self-hatred. The oversocialized person cannot even<br> experience, without guilt, thoughts or feelings that are contrary to<br> the accepted morality; he cannot think &quot;unclean&quot; thoughts. And<br> socialization is not just a matter of morality; we are socialized to<br> confirm to many norms of behavior that do not fall under the heading<br> of morality. Thus the oversocialized person is kept on a psychological<br> leash and spends his life running on rails that society has laid down<br> for him. In many oversocialized people this results in a sense of<br> constraint and powerlessness that can be a severe hardship. We suggest<br> that oversocialization is among the more serious cruelties that human<br> beings inflict on one another.","time":1493309297,"resto":123046988,"id":"Yoh0Ffcu","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":123051653,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)12:09:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123046988\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123046988<\/a><br>Didn&#039;t Anders Breivik (PBUH) copy a lot of his own manifesto directly from the Unabomber&#039;s?<br><br>Kaczynski is like proto-\/pol\/.","time":1493309343,"resto":123046988,"id":"xfNfgI8Y","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123051872,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)12:11:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123048319\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123048319<\/a><br>I read the Manifesto when it first came out.

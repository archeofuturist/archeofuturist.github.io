I will discover this on my first day in camp, as I find that people I considered my most implacable artistic rivals are sharing a bunkhouse with me, and that we are all wearing the same badge, perhaps signifying something like millionaire socialist. The playwrights find the whole thing tragic. The Marxists find it tragic, then funny. The serious writers seem happy but Martin Amis becomes increasingly difficult to read. The comedians are just happy to have been put in with the artists. The screenwriters create pointless conflict and are moved. Everyone complains bitterly at the work rotas drawn up by the novelists. There is an endless debate about which one of us is Banksy. The jazz musicians look for a way to end it all. What a wonderful and creative time it will be for artists, freed from writing for a posterity that no longer exists.

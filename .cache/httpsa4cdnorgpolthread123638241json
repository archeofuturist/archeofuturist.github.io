Most modern translations are just plain shit purely from a scholarly standpoint, but even after that you see them adding their own shit like (((gender-neutral))) language and removing &quot;bad&quot; words or intentionally obfuscating politically incorrect passages e.g. how in Romans 1 homosexuals are called &quot;reprobate&quot; (meaning they can&#039;t be saved and go to heaven) which is changed in modern translations to &quot;depraved&quot; or &quot;foolish&quot;: <br><br>Plus modern translations are all copyrighted and published by big publishing houses. The only way to get copyright protection is to not only make all of your &quot;translations&quot; substantively different than the KJV, as if it&#039;s too similar it gets counted as Public Domain and then the publishing houses can&#039;t get money, but it has to have verse-by-verse different translations from EVERY OTHER Bible translation otherwise you&#039;re violating their copyright protections. So they basically have to change verses for the sake of changing verses, even if they think version X says it perfectly.","filename":"The-Good-Shepherd Catacomb-of-Callixtus","ext":".jpg","w":720,"h":1065,"tn_w":84,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493658700054,"time":1493658700,"md5":"buQQu7cVtLMgY4VwPWcRBw==","fsize":806176,"resto":123638241,"id":"ORFZTfPA","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":123643693,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)13:12:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123641986\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123641986<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;gnostics<\/span>","filename":"FkQoM9R","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":661,"tn_w":94,"tn_h":124,"tim":1493658721702,"time":1493658721,"md5":"pxQTzQgt1abUAWeZtjGGKA==","fsize":133115,"resto":123638241,"id":"H5BK7Bqq","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123643714,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)13:12:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123643013\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123643013<\/a><br>what&#039;s going on here?<br>did they put perverts in the window cages as punishment?","time":1493658731,"resto":123638241,"id":"x8VZaquK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123643733,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)13:12:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123643115\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123643115<\/a><br>Did Martin Luther use original manuscripts for his translation?","time":1493658738,"resto":123638241,"id":"cxB69KmT","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":123643896,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)13:13:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123643714\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123643714<\/a><br>There&#039;s an episode of the podcast Hardcore History dedicated to the anabaptists and the Munster rebellion.

There are no ideals in Trump&#039;s world other than his own advancement. He demonstrated that time and time and time again in the accumulation of personal wealth at the expense of others, his abuse of women, his utter disregard for common decency, and his outright lies while campaigning either against other candidates for the Republican nomination or for the Oval Office. Yet Republicans are so desperate to cling to their majorities in both Houses that they are unwilling to acknowledge what is becoming apparent to even the most diehard Trump supporter; they are supporting a man without scruple, a charlatan, an imposter who is dismissive of the very foundation of democracy and who daily assaults and undermines its principles. And as long as the Republican party props up what is becoming an internationally-embarrassing Oval Office, it is destroying its own credibility.","time":1490721545,"resto":118662098,"id":"0wRtY1Et","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118670881,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)13:20:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"Nunes had a secret meeting or two and a secret midnight rendezvous at the White House.

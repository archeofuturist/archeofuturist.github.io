Pool claims that when he was in the no-go zone, the police told him that it was too dangerous to film there that he had to leave before things got ugly, and that police escorted him out of the no-go zone. <br><br>Swedish police, however, told The Local that Pool did not recieve an escort.

However, he followed the police who left the place,&quot; Stockholm police press spokesperson Kjell Lindgren told The Local. <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Frida Nordl\u00f6f, a police officer in the J\u00e4rva district, also told regional Stockholm newspaper Mitt i that Pool and his colleague had not been escorted out of the area by police. &quot;We had extra officers on the ground because of a poetry evening in Rinkeby with a lot of visitors. When Tim Pool took out a camera and started filming a group of young people they pulled their hoods up and covered their faces and shouted at him to stop filming. The officers then told Tim Pool that it was not wise to stay there in the middle of the square and keep filming,&quot; she said.<\/span>","filename":"RedPill","ext":".jpg","w":520,"h":390,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1490373236256,"time":1490373236,"md5":"yKFQ\/c1+mdRk68S+UCBJ6A==","fsize":15469,"resto":0,"id":"5wldGNOD","country":"NL","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"redpill-thread","country_name":"Netherlands","replies":3,"images":0,"unique_ips":1},{"no":118098397,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)12:35:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"Now, Pool doesn&#039;t have any footage of him talking with the officers, but he does have footage of the police following him, with which both claims can be proven wrong: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ODw<wbr>7o34Vdbk&amp;t=140s<br><br>The claim from the police spokesperson is completly wrong, you can clearly see that Pool&#039;s crew was walking ahead of the cops the whole time.

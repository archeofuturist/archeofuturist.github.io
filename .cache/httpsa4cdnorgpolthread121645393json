As a practice, this usually prevents part of the audience from identifying with characters whose gender would be otherwise unspecified.<br><br>E.g. &quot;I used to admire Dumbledore, but since they gaywashed him, I find it hard to relate his life to my own experience&quot;","filename":"C__Data_Users_DefApps_AppData_INTERNETEXPLORER_Temp_Saved Images_lefou-gay-1488572042","ext":".jpg","w":480,"h":699,"tn_w":171,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492494035274,"time":1492494035,"md5":"L5jXtGJB7eZlYu7CzBCN6Q==","fsize":92086,"resto":0,"id":"bHYio1LN","country":"IT","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"gaywashing","country_name":"Italy","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":121646797,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)01:54:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121645393\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121645393<\/a><br>I was on a family trip when mine dragged me to see this movie. It was so fucking pozed. Every other extra was black, including half of the talking household items, the gay shit was extremely obvious, extra scenes and lines were added to push in more leftist propaganda and worst of all, it was so well made and beautifully designed. Disney is such a waste of talented animators and artists.","time":1492494885,"resto":121645393,"id":"clpNzODZ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

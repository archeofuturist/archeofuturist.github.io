I see this piece of shit as my mortal enemy. As if the almighty has sent you as a test. Or maybe just to fuck with me and just see how far I&#039;ll go. People like you make me fantasize of being the chieftain of a great tribe of the past and gathering up my fellow tribesman to tie you to a table and rip your heart out using a dull knife on a giant slab of stone while dancing around in loin clothes and holding spears. Then as soon as we rip open your chest cavity and reach in for your heart, there is nothing there but spaghetti. And it&#039;s not even good spaghetti.

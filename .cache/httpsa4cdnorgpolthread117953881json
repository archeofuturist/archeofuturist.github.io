WW1 killed off nearly half the young male population of France, and all who were left to reproduce were those whose blood did not boil at the thought of destruction of their homeland. <br><br>The first big part of the problem is purely genetic. The second is cultural. Europe has been in a near constant state of war for the last 1500 years, even if it wasn&#039;t outright. Tribes and eventually nations were always prepared to resist invasion. With the sum total of violence produced by the two wars, it&#039;s as though warfare has been permanently cleansed from the palette of Europe. <br><br>This is all part of the plan. WW1 was elegantly set up to erupt given the alliance system. The basis of this system was international economics before defense, so it was orchestrated by a hidden system of central banking. The treaty of Versailles was orchestrated by these same individuals in the hope that WW2 destroyed warlike sentiments once and for all. Hitler was an unwitting stooge of the Jewish puppeteers who turned on his masters because he only came into power riding a wave of anti-Jewish sentiment following the Jewish communist overthrow of the government.","time":1490291688,"resto":117953881,"id":"weVyiZpw","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117959602,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)13:55:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117957109\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117957109<\/a>","filename":"911000","ext":".jpg","w":490,"h":624,"tn_w":98,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490291705136,"time":1490291705,"md5":"VHVym3sIj2Mzk8IgiJJMFw==","fsize":88887,"resto":117953881,"id":"Xz0oPoLh","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117959702,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)13:56:02","name":"?","com":"<a href=\"#p117958376\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117958376<\/a><br><br>That sounds like bait for a false flag.

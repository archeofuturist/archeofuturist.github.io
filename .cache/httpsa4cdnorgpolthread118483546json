This was his burgeoning interest in actually running for office because they weren&#039;t doing what he saw as reasonable and common sense. He started going around talking about the ills of society most notably in a his Oprah interview outside of the ads he already did:<br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=SEP<wbr>s17_AkTI<br><br>This led to his joining the reform party after Perot ran in 1992 and 1996, foiling Bush Senior and republicans from getting the white house for their lack of focus on conservative small government principles, especially in the area of economics.<br><br>He was informed by Perot that it was impossible with the current system to win as a third party candidate so sought the republican nomination.<br><br>After meeting with head republican strategists, he learned that the process was locked for Bush II. He then wanted to use the reform party as his foray into politics on the ballot in a 2000 run but the reform party fell apart before the election.<br><br>After the 2000 election there was no point for him to consider a run again until 2008, as he could not run as a Republican. Yet again the process locked him out in favor of establishment candidate McCain but he also did not wish to run in 2008 due to the unpopularity of the Republican party of the time.<br><br>(1\/?)","filename":"1487462073152","ext":".jpg","w":480,"h":594,"tn_w":101,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490597337083,"time":1490597337,"md5":"0dWuaZPucl+YUGBdrbrYBg==","fsize":46848,"resto":118483546,"id":"z\/pm6qfU","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118483758,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)02:49:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"Kelly anne Conway is a retard","time":1490597344,"resto":118483546,"id":"fr2d3Z3J","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118483765,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)02:49:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"I&#039;m going to bed, I&#039;ll talk to you all tomorrow.<br>Have a good night, and as always, MAGA!","filename":"1471088117749","ext":".jpg","w":1083,"h":900,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":103,"tim":1490597350512,"time":1490597350,"md5":"snuAwkMHMRBS4tWfatcLoQ==","fsize":117861,"resto":118483546,"id":"aZf9fuWo","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":118483776,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)02:49:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118483732\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118483732<\/a>","filename":"1445289680163","ext":".jpg","w":620,"h":346,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":69,"tim":1490597359042,"time":1490597359,"md5":"rOHQwi5nDVrR6u2\/HMnKWg==","fsize":44533,"resto":118483546,"id":"m5hop6TY","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118483828,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)02:50:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118483750\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118483750<\/a><br>He was able to get votes at a lower cost in primaries than any republican candidate in history.<br><br>His combination of very smart hires like Manafort (who won the primaries for every republican he served) and a lean crew using social media to largely propel the message was drastically more cost effective than any other campaign.<br><br>Just like his mentor Perot in the past, Trump was able to self-fund his campaign, largely, due to his enormous wealth, and did not have to serve interests or do events that he did not deem to gain him the votes he needed.<br><br>He went on to win the presidency at the lowest relative campaign cost in modern American political history.

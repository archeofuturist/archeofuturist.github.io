Most of Polish farmers found other markets to replace Russian one, but they didn&#039;t want to burn bridges, because sanctions don&#039;t last forever, so they export their stuff to Russia but visa proxy: Belarus, Kazakhstan and other countries of so called &quot;russian world&quot;. F.e.: Belarus began to import 26x more plums and 30x more milk from Poland after sanctions were introduced, which surely looks kind of suspicious but Russians probably don&#039;t care xD. Later on Belarusians mark these things with their trademark and sell to Russia as &quot;Belarusian product&quot;. Sometimes they are even too lazy to mark it as a product from Belarus, so they send trucks full of Polish products straight to Russian shops, risking that they are going to be checked by Russian police. If the Russian policeman is not bribed propery, it indeed happens, and then all these products are destroyed in front of camera accordingto Putin&#039;s Law, and showed in Russian TV to the audience. <br><br>Thanks to sanctions and Putin&#039;s grand strategy Poland sells as much products to the East as never before, for higher prices. Final consumers (Russians) pay 2x-3x higher price for these products thinking that they are Belarusian\/Kazakh\/Serbian\/whatever.<wbr> <br><br>Destruction of Polish tea and red caviar: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=B6J<wbr>vf1Iubb8<br>Destruction of Polish pears: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=7V0<wbr>6-Wbl3Hw<br>Destruction of Polish apples: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=x7F<wbr>cTK8rdWM<br>Destruction of Polish mushrooms: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=M_n<wbr>e5BhD6jg<br>Destruction of Polish meat: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=uQ-<wbr>1ruOsbys","filename":"sanctions russia","ext":".jpg","w":1365,"h":1684,"tn_w":202,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490434582095,"time":1490434582,"md5":"AtTEYwGW\/hcQZ06rHZE36g==","fsize":495800,"resto":0,"id":"F8+XfCjR","country":"PL","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"polish-thread-about-roosia","country_name":"Poland","replies":29,"images":14,"unique_ips":10},{"no":118209404,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)05:52:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"millions of russians are too poor to buy food.. why not giving them this &#039;illegal&#039; food for free instead of destroying it?","filename":"Screenshot_20170325-105018","ext":".png","w":1440,"h":2560,"tn_w":70,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490435536791,"time":1490435536,"md5":"Af2ZJIYs96D\/ihavKOq\/\/g==","fsize":1903258,"resto":118208356,"id":"QmLXtv+M","country":"PL","m_img":1,"country_name":"Poland"},{"no":118209438,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)05:52:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118208356\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118208356<\/a><br>Kek.<br>So Putin can actually improve the economy (even when not his own)","time":1490435566,"resto":118208356,"id":"nPCl9yFX","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":118209711,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)05:57:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118208356\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118208356<\/a><br><a href=\"#p118209404\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118209404<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; videos<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; t. believe that russians actually destroy it<\/span><br>They just make a short video-proof and resell the rest themselves.","time":1490435820,"resto":118208356,"id":"2c5HVYFX","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":118209772,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)05:57:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118208356\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118208356<\/a>","filename":"dv","ext":".jpg","w":251,"h":353,"tn_w":88,"tn_h":124,"tim":1490435875870,"time":1490435875,"md5":"B5t6pKL\/6l6rddB9PdrZJg==","fsize":18669,"resto":118208356,"id":"mNE64c0t","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":118209825,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)05:58:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"fuck poland and fuck russia","filename":"1489924432247","ext":".png","w":900,"h":900,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490435932103,"time":1490435932,"md5":"DqHja8dJnYeL3M5c5h1nBg==","fsize":133721,"resto":118208356,"id":"MKSsftyM","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":118210045,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)06:02:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118208356\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118208356<\/a><br>Good to know.

I already gave you definition of quality. Do you really think that Samsung would produce new models of Galaxy every year if there wasn&#039;t companies like Apple competing with them brutally and constantly by introducing new technologies and ideas? Your country and Russia are the best living evidences that you have no idea about economy, because you live in disfunctional poverty ridden shitholes. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; trade balance of poland is negative again lol, it was positive for a short time due to oil prices.<\/span><br><br>This graph shows that trade balance in Poland was shortly negative in july 2016 when oil price was 45 dollar and the graph shows trade surplus in January 2017 when the oil price was 55 dollar<br><br>https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/quote\/CO1<wbr>:COM<br><br>So how can it be connected to the oil price, soviet ape? xD<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; russia produces many things for own protected domestic market.<\/span><br><br>Just like every country, yeah. But in case of Russia all these products have high prices and are of shitty quality. F.e. a shitty Rossian apartment in a commie block with 30 floors costs more than a cosy Polish apartment in a modern building with 3 floors due to corruption and lack of proper competition on the construction market, kek","filename":"residence permits 2015","ext":".jpg","w":2907,"h":1227,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":52,"tim":1490441181487,"time":1490441181,"md5":"ML6nr6aNHLsUt9ixU1n47Q==","fsize":1147370,"resto":118208356,"id":"F8+XfCjR","country":"PL","m_img":1,"country_name":"Poland"},{"no":118216159,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)07:36:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118214003\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118214003<\/a><br><a href=\"#p118214851\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118214851<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; t.

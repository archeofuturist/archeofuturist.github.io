But it doesn&#039;t want to actually get rid of Obamacare because it needs something to screech about to drum up votes from an enraged base. That&#039;s why any time they have a chance to actually make a change, they go full retard and make insanely unreasonable demands, and if one thing doesn&#039;t meet their ideological requirement, they fight it tooth &amp; nail. They don&#039;t want to do actual governing with a bit of compromise because it is easier for them to sell &quot;fighting the good fight&quot; to their enthralled base.<br><br>Paul Ryan is kind of a douche, but I think Trump was sincere in initially backing his moderate plan because he understood it was actually feasible and got rid of the most onerous things like the mandate to buy healthcare. <br><br>To be honest, that mandate is all I really give a shit about getting rid of and the Freedom Caucus dudes need to be whipped in line to support a moderate bill that actually incrementally moves things where they want it.","filename":"1490583875681","ext":".jpg","w":986,"h":553,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1493000376839,"time":1493000376,"md5":"Z8f5n4h5TLEqwb\/HeNz48A==","fsize":98576,"resto":122524177,"id":"P8r8Cp72","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122527933,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)22:19:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122527431\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122527431<\/a><br>Theres still a chance","time":1493000379,"resto":122524177,"id":"KR0R0yO6","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122527961,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)22:19:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122527730\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122527730<\/a><br>I love her...so does my cock.","time":1493000394,"resto":122524177,"id":"+MnAN6zk","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122527984,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)22:20:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122527708\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122527708<\/a><br>god damn that is rage<br>i only made it 37 seconds before i had to shut it off","time":1493000411,"resto":122524177,"id":"T76L\/u9Z","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122527998,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)22:20:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122524413\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122524413<\/a><br>Hosea","time":1493000418,"resto":122524177,"id":"WexZcWtX","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122528048,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)22:20:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122527757\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122527757<\/a><br>That&#039;s nice.","time":1493000441,"resto":122524177,"id":"9m7o59xi","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122528052,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)22:20:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122527795\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122527795<\/a><br>Spice and Wolf?","time":1493000443,"resto":122524177,"id":"KCq4w4f3","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122528083,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)22:20:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122524551\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122524551<\/a><br>MAH NIGGA OATHKEEPER WHEN?","filename":"1469569359329","ext":".jpg","w":599,"h":563,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":117,"tim":1493000453992,"time":1493000453,"md5":"Gfmxq5Mo0ylj1HBRIfMEMQ==","fsize":51276,"resto":122524177,"id":"7rd+guEL","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122528114,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)22:21:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122527601\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122527601<\/a><br>You&#039;re weak anon.

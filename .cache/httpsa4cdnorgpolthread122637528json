All Southamerican countries have and need social programs and they all work without considering themselves &quot;socialists&quot;. In fact, even right wingers believe in social programs. Chavez sponsonred many leftists like Lula, Kirchner, Evo, Humala, and Correa around eight years ago, but they were never fully socialists. People like Lula or Kirchner are loved because they had a lot of social programs who involved simply giving people things away, like laptops or money. That doesn&#039;t mean that other programs didn&#039;t work. They did. If any of these pres had gone fully socialist, they would be exactly like Venezuela now.

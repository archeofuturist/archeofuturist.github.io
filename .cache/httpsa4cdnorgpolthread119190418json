It is not solid as most people think it is, because the atoms that compose &#039;the world&#039; are made of empty space. Furthermore, &#039;the world&#039; as we know it does not even exist &#039;out there&#039; - it exists only &#039;in here&#039; and is projected by us only when we tune in to it. What we call &#039;the world&#039; is a computer simulation, which means that it is illusory and therefore malleable. What we call &#039;ghosts&#039; are beings that are so close to our frequency band that they can &#039;bleed&#039; through like a form of broadcasting interference. A radio accurately tuned to a radio station frequency will produce a clear, sharp reception with no interference, but when the dial is slightly off-centre, another station or stations can be heard alongside the main one. What we call &#039;ghosts&#039; are based on the same basic principle and reptilians (for example) are basically beings that we could think of as &#039;ghosts&#039; in that they inhabit a frequency band that vibrates very closely to the one we inhabit. To us, a &#039;ghost&#039; would not look solid - but to that &#039;ghost&#039;, we are the ones who would not look solid. There are an infinite number of frequency bands and they all share the same space usually without interfering with each other.","filename":"1470539790294","ext":".jpg","w":480,"h":200,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":52,"tim":1491139489761,"time":1491139489,"md5":"6d727qa6NMNqOhXLxUDrkw==","fsize":19104,"resto":119190418,"id":"lWTjOoQI","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":119198685,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)09:25:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119197820\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119197820<\/a><br>This is true <a href=\"#p119198333\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119198333<\/a> the kikery only started in 1913","time":1491139526,"resto":119190418,"id":"N03FHPje","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119198725,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)09:26:03","name":"Pls call me Buddy","com":"<a href=\"#p119197620\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119197620<\/a><br>Then why are they called fossil fuels?","filename":"1427237459408.gif","ext":".gif","w":320,"h":320,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491139563107,"time":1491139563,"md5":"d77yv0mJ0IP08Oqold7PVw==","fsize":1334399,"resto":119190418,"id":"ZdRSHCra","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119198765,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)09:26:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"I&#039;ll have what he&#039;s <a href=\"#p119198634\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119198634<\/a> sniffing (petrol)","time":1491139594,"resto":119190418,"id":"N03FHPje","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119198779,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)09:26:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119198291\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119198291<\/a><br>Stop ham fisting your pen and it&#039;s fine.

I&#039;m just saying that the system that propagated their development was based on aggregating resources which was an early form of the process that became severely corrupt through the Cold War that bankrupted the people who lived in the societies where those R&amp;D power structures became entrenched. There appears to be more meritocracy in that earlier era, or more social mobility through merit. That social mobility has stagnated completely in the last decades, and any trace of meritocracy has been erased. Instead you have to participate in empty professionalism and tick the right boxes and be held in thrall to those boondoggle institutions to have a seat at the table for a comfortable stable life. Starting in the late 1800s there were industry titans who aggregated more resources than they were capable of managing without being affected by their capricious human limitations, and in doing that they made decisions for the lives of others that were unjustifiable. I don&#039;t believe that things were idyllic in the past, so much as it being the case that the information about institutional inefficiency wasn&#039;t available then.<br><br>It isn&#039;t a secret conspiring society, it&#039;s a network of self-interested people who don&#039;t have cause to question their place in society, because they don&#039;t want to have to give up their comfortable lifestyle that was afforded to them through irrational in-preference. It&#039;s human behavior en-masse, not a conspiracy. But letting that capricious human nature make unscrutinized decisions that have impacts for other people only furthers the amount of chaos to contend with in developing a stable society. All that does is continue to stratify people and further the rich-poor divide, which is untenable for long term stability.","time":1491140624,"resto":119190418,"id":"HOyF4eWI","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119200299,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)09:44:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119198725\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119198725<\/a><br>Christian theology demands the Earth be 6k years old, abiogenic processes and the other fun stuff like the iron pirates from the inland sea that ravaged pre classical Egypt to the point they rebooted in 7k AD disprove that.","time":1491140688,"resto":119190418,"id":"My\/Q1g4P","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119200356,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)09:45:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119197708\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119197708<\/a><br><a href=\"#p119198634\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119198634<\/a><br><br>Will you normies ever get a grasp on the full picture?","filename":"The full picture","ext":".png","w":640,"h":360,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1491140727148,"time":1491140727,"md5":"2mfivMUUmZLKx5DUcwmiqg==","fsize":84687,"resto":119190418,"id":"FbAGAglw","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":119200426,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)09:46:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119200109\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119200109<\/a><br>get on my level","filename":"full","ext":".png","w":2901,"h":2418,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":104,"tim":1491140775587,"time":1491140775,"md5":"ta0wtjmEkdo4SVi80GE7Xg==","fsize":1158269,"resto":119190418,"id":"nMH5Cj5W","country":"FR","m_img":1,"country_name":"France"},{"no":119200435,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)09:46:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119198634\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119198634<\/a><br>This is the truth.

You can do ANYTHING YOU WANT TO DO and you can be ANYTHING YOU WANT TO BE. They want us to think that the average person is powerless to positively change the world, but the TRUTH is that we have INFINITE POWER - both individually AND collectively. There&#039;s only one of us here. If you hit yourself on the head with a baseball bat, they&#039;ll put you in a mental hospital, yet that&#039;s EXACTLY what people are doing on a global scale. You can call Pure Consciousness &#039;God&#039; if you want, but I don&#039;t because the word &#039;God&#039; has religious connotations that I would rather avoid. Religion is the McDonald&#039;s of spirituality.<br><br>What we need to do is to raise our level of consciousness, both individually AND collectively. If even one person raises his or her level of consciousness, it has a ripple effect that benefits EVERYONE ELSE, even if they don&#039;t believe any of this stuff - and this is because &#039;reality&#039; itself is HOLOGRAPHIC in nature. One of the ways that they have manipulated us so deeply for so long is by suppressing our sense of the possible. What we call &#039;reality&#039; is COMPLETELY ILLUSORY and thus MALLEABLE - and they KNOW THIS, while most other people do NOT. EVERYTHING IS ILLUSORY, EXCEPT PURE CONSCIOUSNESS ITSELF. NOTHING is impossible in a universe that is ILLUSORY TO BEGIN WITH. People are AWAKENING to a MORE EXPANDED CONCEPTION of the world and life in general and this is a PROFOUNDLY GOOD THING. We owe it to our innate intelligence to QUESTION EVERYTHING and that includes EVERYTHING that I tell you. We have the power to transform this prison illusion into a PARADISE ILLUSION, so let&#039;s USE that power.","filename":"image","ext":".png","w":581,"h":552,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":118,"tim":1491142719615,"time":1491142719,"md5":"R\/z8uoO6vDm+FWOmJ0wqmA==","fsize":677458,"resto":119190418,"id":"lWTjOoQI","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":119203476,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)10:18:40","name":"OhOhOneOhOneOneOh","com":"<a href=\"#p119202999\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119202999<\/a>","filename":"eye","ext":".jpg","w":957,"h":714,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1491142720215,"time":1491142720,"md5":"YKawtQi7p4dz\/hf91h0Xhw==","fsize":229884,"resto":119190418,"id":"emmxSL7t","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119203545,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)10:19:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119203474\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119203474<\/a><br><br>We&#039;re all one - and the beauty of this is that we don&#039;t have to be cucks despite this fact (and it IS a fact).

Our TRUE STATE, our TRUE NATURE and our TRUE IDENTITY is Pure Consciousness and Pure Consciousness is ALL-PERFECT AND EVER-PERFECT. We are SIMULTANEOUSLY one yet different in our oneness in much the same way that the waves of an ocean are one with that ocean but are also unique in and of themselves in that each wave has its own shape, speed and size. I think that&#039;s pretty neat. What we call &#039;reality&#039; is HOLOGRAPHIC in nature, so we are in fact smaller versions of the whole (which you can call &#039;God&#039;, if you want). Every part of the whole contains the whole and, to be more accurate, IS the whole. And just as a drop of water contains the same qualities as an entire ocean of water, we likewise contain all that exists within us - but merely on a smaller scale. From unconditional love we ALL sprang and to unconditional love we ALL return. There are no answers, only choices. There are no hallucinations, only shifts in perception. There are no laws, only habits. There are no coincidences, only synchronicities. There are no truths, only experiences. Heaven and Earth shall pass away, but my message shall NEVER pass away.

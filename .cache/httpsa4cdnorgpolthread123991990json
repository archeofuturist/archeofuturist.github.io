To see you guys throw away all this effort over such inconsequential shit just fucking kills me. It&#039;s like all the insane stuff we saw this election cycle was thrown down the fucking Memory Hole.<br><br>When Hitler openly came out against the Jews, he only made it easier for them to rally half the world against him; they had a face and even an organization to focus their opposition at, only simplifying things. You guys have no problem recognizing the system is rigged this way, but the possibility that Trump may be trying to subvert this system by playing it doesn&#039;t even cross your minds?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;CHESSKEK<\/span><br><br>Look, I&#039;m not saying it&#039;s not possible Trump is a puppet. If this were any other election, I would say that is 99.99% likely the case. However, this was NOT an ordinary election; (((they))) fought tooth and fucking nail to stop Trump. Surely they knew what (((they))) were up against was bad news for them, and I find it hard to believe he was subverted that quickly and easily. Where are all the FBIanons warning us that Trump has been caught? If that was the case we would have surely seen plenty of those by now.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;BUT HE REMOVED BANNON FROM NSC<\/span><br><br>That was already a temporary position.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;BUT MUH SYRIA STRIKE<\/span><br><br>Most of them didn&#039;t even hit anything, just fucked up the runway a little. It also got the accusation of being a Russian agent off his back. They announced no policy change in Syria.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;BUT NO WALL<\/span><br><br>Simply not true. Wall is already being built.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;BUT NO OBAMACARE REPEAL<\/span><br><br>A deal could be reached this weak. If not, I don&#039;t see anything wrong with letting it implode so bad that Americans never want to touch universal healthcare again.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;BUT SESSIONS SAID HE&#039;S GOING AFTER ASSANGE<\/span><br><br>Assange was never mentioned.<br><br>I&#039;m not saying to have blind devotion to Trump, but can we please just be rational and recognize we don&#039;t see everything that goes on behind the scenes? Can we wait before we call Trump a conman?","filename":"wedge","ext":".gif","w":375,"h":351,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":234,"tim":1493858472363,"time":1493858472,"md5":"u1KOeYzZ8Di7PjsZplr6Zg==","fsize":18094,"resto":0,"id":"a8+C7Gfo","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-wedge-is-being-driven","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

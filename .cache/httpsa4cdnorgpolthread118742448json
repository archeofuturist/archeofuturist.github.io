There are fundamental issues within the country that no current or future leader is going to be able to resolve. Deindustrialization, mass immigration, unsustainable welfare, foreign entanglements, etc.. It&#039;s all crashing down on us. We&#039;re in national decline. Tell me who can bridge the gap and fix the fundamental problems with the country. If the Democrats think they can just go into 2020 with the same attitude they have now and expect to win, they&#039;re wrong. Whether you like or dislike Trump, he at the very least talked about the serious issues instead of pandering to unimportant SJW horseshit.

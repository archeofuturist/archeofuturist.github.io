That part of military assault is very (un)obvious. For example i was working in upper west side restaurant and one of the regulars made his fortune in real estate by utilizing such &quot;labor&quot; provided by prison industry. So he served as slave owner for former prisoners - very cheap labor. So he used to renovate brownhouses. SODA SOPA. He was already retired in the early 2000s. Of course it doesn&#039;t mean he was using prison labor. Maybe it was only &quot;ihre papiere bitte&quot; identities. I was asking about security and safety issues dealing with ex convict - it didn&#039;t seem an issue to him at all. So maybe human resources were in fact busy seabees or traveling journeymen al-qaeda of worshipful company of freemasons. <br>So in this sense prison in the target society serves as pool to attack the free society in unfair manner. It&#039;s not exactly about subverting the justice - it&#039;s about unfair advantage of slavery to be used against freedom.","time":1493807217,"resto":123896658,"id":"p38dvphJ","country":"LT","country_name":"Lithuania"},{"no":123898387,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)06:28:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123896658\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123896658<\/a><br>All those jewy names lol","time":1493807287,"resto":123896658,"id":"Fn2vnVYi","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123898516,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)06:29:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123896658\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123896658<\/a><br>who&#039;s nr 6?<br>thats the real qestion","time":1493807399,"resto":123896658,"id":"DX9dQqV+","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":123898589,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)06:31:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;David David<\/span>","filename":"1477491274495","ext":".jpg","w":414,"h":415,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493807464617,"time":1493807464,"md5":"Nj1NPx\/du6SbjQqOSzU19A==","fsize":13484,"resto":123896658,"id":"mrQsyGY3","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

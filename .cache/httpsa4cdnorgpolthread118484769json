The Scriptures&#039; meaning is mediated through many kinds of secondary authority, such as the ordinary teaching offices of the Church, the ecumenical creeds, the councils of the Christian Church, and so on. However, sola scriptura rejects any original infallible authority other than the Bible. In this view, all secondary authority is derived from the authority of the Scriptures and is therefore subject to reform when compared to the teaching of the Bible. Church councils, preachers, Bible commentators, private revelation, or even a message allegedly from an angel or an apostle are not an original authority alongside the Bible in the sola scriptura approach.<\/span><br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sola_<wbr>scriptura<br><br>Sola fide<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Sola fide, or &quot;faith alone&quot;, asserts that good works are not a means or requisite for salvation.

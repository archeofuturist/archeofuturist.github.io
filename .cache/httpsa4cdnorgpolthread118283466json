However, the evidence of the whole affair was such a crock of shit that Goering very nearly blew the entire sham out of the water then and there during his hearing. While in the yard with the other defendants, he overheard a group of people talking about Hungarian jews and made a joke &quot;Hungarian jews? I thought we killed them all!&quot;.

He responded with such a combination of solemnity, authority and rage that he made the british guy look down in shame, and the jew flinch. Imagine that: a man brought before his enemies in chains, to be mocked and shamed then executed. Instead, he turns the tables on THEM, and makes them feel fear and guilt.

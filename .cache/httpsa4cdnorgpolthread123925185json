The later intellectual and spiritual temperament of Constantine\ufffds Italians are outright Oriental and totally different from the earlier Romans.<br>Let us notice the spiritual side of this change, not of temperament, but of race. These incoming races from Syria, Asia Minor and Phoenicia brought with them their Chaldean sun-worship and the mystery cults. The early Romans repudiated these Oriental religions, but the slaves, who soon became the greater part of the population and freedmen, accepted them outright. Professor Frank calls attention to this change from one type of religion to another. It would be illuminating by way of illustration of this change to study the spread of the mystery religions. What of this change? How did the Romans accept the Chaldean mystery religion?

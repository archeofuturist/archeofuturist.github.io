It now has the modern meaning &quot;to celebrate all armed personnel in these countries&quot;.<br><br>Truthfully, if I&#039;m allowed to speak my mind, I don&#039;t give a shit. FACT, if all New Zealand, Australian and Canadian troops did not fight in WW1, the outcome would be exactly the same. It is mostly the British that took casualties significantly. Every way NZ was involved with was this stupid feeling that &quot;we were essentially an extension of Britain&quot; so we cucked ourselves into following them.<br><br>Then after WW2 the UK stopped being relevant and we became USA&#039;s bitch getting involved in wars like the Vietnam war &quot;to protect the west&quot;. All soldiers who came back from that felt disgraced and there was no joyous celebration like the end of WW2. And I&#039;m supposed to celebrate all of this?<br><br>Truth be told, countries only &quot;go to war&quot; to protect their assets (resources etc). There is very little &quot;honour&quot; and &quot;doing what is right&quot;. I think ANZAC day is a terrible way to commemorate ourselves with hundreds of thousands more people die in modern day wars.","filename":"anzac-24hn9z5","ext":".jpg","w":1020,"h":703,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":172,"tim":1493599449051,"time":1493599449,"md5":"4YxTZ4bHSmdRZM+UnLeY9w==","fsize":388502,"resto":0,"id":"DcpRmOcp","country":"NZ","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"i-cant-be-the-only-kiwi-who-doesnt-give-a-shit","country_name":"New Zealand","replies":68,"images":21,"unique_ips":31},{"no":123553046,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)20:46:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123552808\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123552808<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;and Canadian troops<\/span><br><br>Australia and<br>New<br>Zealand<br>Army<br>Corps<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;cucked<\/span><br><br>Good for you.

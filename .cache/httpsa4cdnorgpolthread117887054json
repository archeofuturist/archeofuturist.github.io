Emergent properties only exist subjectively. There is no such thing as mind-independent, objective emergent properties, in the same way there is no such thing as mind-independent, objective information. Only the mind gives these things meaning. The mind objectively exists. Thus the mind isn&#039;t an emergent property. Thus the mind can&#039;t be produced by matter. Thus the mind is immaterial.

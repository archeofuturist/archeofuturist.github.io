Here&#039;s what you can do:<br><br>1. First of all, you need some high-quality, battle-ready memes. Can&#039;t make memes in French? Don&#039;t know how to make potent memes for this situation? That&#039;s okay, because your fellow autists have already made memes for you. All you gotta do is spread &#039;em. You can find great memes on Reddit&#039;s \/r\/Le_Pen (yeah, I know, fuck Leddit and all that, but trust me on this), and there have been several memedumps on this very thread already.<br>2. What type of memes do you want? Easy. Pro-Le Pen memes probably won&#039;t work by themselves; we want to reach out to undecideds and moderates who are considering Macron. So mostly focus on memes showing (a) the effect of terrorism on France and Macron&#039;s &quot;meh whatever we can&#039;t stop it anyway&quot; attitude toward it, (b) Macron&#039;s status as a big, aloof globalist cuck banker, and (c) the fact that Macron will basically be Hollande (the current, much-despised French president) in a different body.<br>3. Once you get those memes, spread &#039;em on Twitter, Cuckbook, Instagram, etc., with hashtags like #JamaisMacron, #Macron2017, #Elysee2017, and #JeVote, along with any other hashtags you can find that French voters might be browsing. As I said, our goal is to get these memes to moderates and undecideds.<br><br><br>That&#039;s just the basics of what you can do. And for all the shills here: yes, we get it, she has slim chances. Fuck you, stop trying to demoralize us, because it won&#039;t work. This isn&#039;t about Le Pen. It&#039;s about a rising tide of neonationalism and populism that can&#039;t be stopped. Le Pen may go down, but she&#039;s gonna give the globalists a hell of a scare before she does. Wilders almost won, Hofer almost won, and now Le Pen will almost win. Similar leaders in Europe and around the globe will be inspired and galvanized, and eventually, more will start winning. Just like Brexit. Just like Trump.","time":1493345274,"resto":123118425,"id":"cddyWNs3","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123128976,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)22:09:56","name":"SlamDuncan","com":"3rd Times the Charm!<br><br>Pray that France wins against Germany for once.<br><br>Fuck Hollande.

Random mutations occur, and sometimes those mutations are positive, and thus the mutated offspring survives to reproduce and spread said superior genes. When the mutations are not positive, you get down-syndrome sticken tards who die off and don&#039;t get to spread their genes. The reason humanity hasn&#039;t evolved much in the past three thousand years is because our species was so superior to every other species on this planet that if someone had a mutation, it wouldn&#039;t matter much. The rest of humanity wouldn&#039;t get outbred by some freak who was born with functional wings, he&#039;d just be a freak, as every other human can live perfectly fine without that mutation because we&#039;re such a durable species. On the other hand, it makes perfect sense that an insect that crawls around on the ground and gets eaten by ground predators would survive better by adapting wings to fly away.

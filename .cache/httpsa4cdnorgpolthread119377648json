I&#039;ll tell you that for my pain, the marijuana is actually patently better for it. I have a form of inflammatory degenerative Arthritis called Psoriatic Arthritis, it&#039;s an autoimmune disease where my own immune system attacks my bodies own connective tissue, so joints, and skin. Bleeding rashes out of my forearms and face, and really hot painful joints.<br><br>Hydrocodone just made me feel happy and sleepy but I did still perceive the pain. I couldn&#039;t walk on those joints or use them, but I could tolerate just being alive I guess where without any pain relief or just Ibuprofen I was miserable.<br><br>but with a High CBD, low THC strain called Harlequin? It kills the inflammation, like my right foot that is currently going through an attack (I dont use weed every day, this was like my 3rd day in a row without it), was looking really angry and bruised all over from inflammation, it hurt to walk on.<br><br>About 1\/4 of a gram of harlequin later, it&#039;s looking a lot less angry, not so red (still bruised looking though that&#039;ll take a few days to clear up), and I could walk on it to the mailbox at least without any real pain. It was negligible .<br><br>Now marijuana might not work for all kinds of pain, but for degenerative arthritis or any form of inflammation? I&#039;d recommend a high CBD strain like Harlequin. Don&#039;t think because you smoked weed once illegally and it didn&#039;t alleviate your pain that cannabis won&#039;t be any good for pain. Realize that for decades they&#039;ve been breeding cannabis for high THC, low CBD content (because CBD counteracts some of the psychoactive effect of THC, you don&#039;t get as high). If you buy black market, you&#039;re getting a strain that&#039;s over 20% THC, and at most 1% CBD.<br><br>A strain like Harlequin that&#039;s specifically meant to be medical, is about 4-7% THC and 10-20% CBD. It barely gets you buzzed, no munchies, no sleepy.

THEY&#039;RE TURNING THE FREAKING FROGS GAY.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The Disappearing Frogs Project (DFP) was created In 2013 by Charlotte NC-based artist Terry Thirion. The concept is to bring synergy between artists and scientists to the public, communicating the unprecedented global amphibian decline and potential effects of species extinction. Awareness in the community is being raised; hearts of the public are being touched; and the Disappearing Frogs Project is inspiring people to get involved and to take personal action.<\/span><br><br>http:\/\/www.amphibians.org\/disappear<wbr>ingfrogsproject\/<br><br>We must protect kek and his disciples.","filename":"20141208_120334","ext":".jpg","w":5312,"h":2988,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1491277439851,"time":1491277439,"md5":"LVLvX4GmIycXY2S9p1Nbfg==","fsize":2268215,"resto":0,"id":"NBNs3Zb8","country":"CA","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"save-the-frogs","country_name":"Canada","replies":4,"images":2,"unique_ips":2},{"no":119427053,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)23:51:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Amphibians are the most threatened group of animals in the world according to the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Amphibians are being negatively impacted by habitat loss, disease, over-exploitation and a number of other factors. Being so sensitive to environmental change means that amphibians are often some of the first animals to decline as our environment becomes degraded. So when amphibians are being lost we should be concerned because it means our environment is also degrading.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Fortunately there is a lot that can be done to save amphibians around the world, and a lot is already being done. The ASA has helped bring together over 100 organizations from around the world to implement action that will help save amphibians. We are working with policy makers to help develop global strategies to protect amphibians, we are helping local community groups establish protected areas for their local environment and amphibians, and collaborating with world class scientist to help cure different amphibian diseases.<\/span>","time":1491277913,"resto":119426216,"id":"NBNs3Zb8","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119427752,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)23:58:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"They&#039;re just like us, external forces are polluting our waters and slowly are killing us. https:\/\/youtu.be\/jKl_-sQuDEs","filename":"1484781032119","ext":".jpg","w":864,"h":864,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491278319481,"time":1491278319,"md5":"dpxDf02e\/FMgC+d\/mpuWMw==","fsize":170232,"resto":119426216,"id":"NBNs3Zb8","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119428772,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)00:08:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Frogs are disappearing<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In danger of becoming extinct <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\/pol\/ is upset about this new development <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Biologists are unsure how to save the frogs<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\/pol\/ initiates massive campaign <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Tfw 4chan single-handedly saves a species<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Entire world rejoices and praises \/pol\/ &gt;United States&#039; MSM tries to deny the victory<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Backlash of epic proportions <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\/pol\/ is saving the world, ples no hate <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\/pol\/ mobilizes the frogs <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;creates massive frog army <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;defeat the Globalists with frog army <\/span><br><br>Praise Kek!","filename":"kekwarrior","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":800,"tn_w":93,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491278906039,"time":1491278906,"md5":"BXSLZ34QNF1tuqXcEEjz8A==","fsize":220803,"resto":119426216,"id":"eWgVN2f9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119429052,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)00:11:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119428772\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119428772<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;kek unleashes plague on swamp city washington<\/span><br><br>just realized the whole swamp deal and us being frogs...

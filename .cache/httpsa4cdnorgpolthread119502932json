This guy on the show, Mike Cernovich, said that they recruit these underage girls from comic-cons.<br>He said the security men for these cons work as &quot;spotters&quot;, spotting vulnerable looking underage girls. They sort of befriend them, tell the girls they know people in the porn industry, but since they&#039;re too young for that right now they&#039;ll have to wait. In the meantime these spotters\/security men get the girls hooked on drugs and keep them supplied, then the girls suddenly find themselves being ushered in to bedrooms where the people the deep state want to blackmail are all woozy from drugs put in their drinks. Then they have the girls pose with these blackmail targets on the bed and take pictures and in this way have control over their targets.<br><br>Don&#039;t attack the messenger, just relating what I heard. Take it as you will.","filename":"1489556225749","ext":".jpg","w":641,"h":530,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":206,"tim":1491333048773,"time":1491333048,"md5":"RZh9\/4LOgj11cX0pFP+ZGQ==","fsize":42834,"resto":0,"id":"3\/9H+2Hj","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"okay-dont-get-mad-im-just-relating-what-i-just","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

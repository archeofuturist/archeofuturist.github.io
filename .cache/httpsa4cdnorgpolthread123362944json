The troubling reality being referred to is the widespread practice of Muslim inbreeding and the birth defects and social ills that it spawns.<br><br>The tragic effect of the left\u2019s control of the boundaries of debate is that any discussion about vital issues such as these marks an individual as an \u201cIslamophobe\u201d and a \u201cracist.\u201d A person who dares to point at the pathology of inbreeding in the Muslim community is accused of whipping up hatred against Muslim people. But all of this could not be further from the truth. To fight against inbreeding anywhere is to defend humanity and to defend innocent babies from birth defects. Fighting against this Islamic practice stems from a pro-Muslim calling, since identifying destructive ideologies and practices in Islam enables the protection of the Muslim people from harm.<br><br>Massive inbreeding among Muslims has been going on since their prophet allowed first-cousin marriages more than 50 generations (1,400 years) ago. For many Muslims, therefore, intermarriage is regarded as being part of their religion. In many Muslim communities, it is a source of social status to marry one&#039;s daughter or son to his or her cousin. Intermarriage also ensures that wealth is kept within the family. Islam\u2019s strict authoritarianism plays a large role as well: keeping daughters and sons close gives families more power to control and decide their choices and lifestyles.","filename":"1491312586955","ext":".jpg","w":839,"h":740,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":110,"tim":1493492325385,"time":1493492325,"md5":"PyRhU4ngMP7\/dzZEU2ETMw==","fsize":160766,"resto":123362944,"id":"gbBpiu1r","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123366165,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)14:59:00","name":"Anonymous","filename":"1480272374100","ext":".jpg","w":2927,"h":3583,"tn_w":102,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493492340285,"time":1493492340,"md5":"laAp4Bke8sa1dDMn9p0E9A==","fsize":2595696,"resto":123362944,"id":"GBh8+EF2","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":123366172,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)14:59:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123363358\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123363358<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;pedophilia, wanton killing of innocents, and idolatry isn&#039;t degenerate<\/span><br><br>kys fag","filename":"ataturk","ext":".jpg","w":850,"h":400,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":58,"tim":1493492344463,"time":1493492344,"md5":"d+scblchoTK6kYLt+2MRLw==","fsize":68505,"resto":123362944,"id":"8NV8LMPV","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123366226,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)14:59:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123366130\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123366130<\/a><br><br>Westerners have a historical tradition of being ready to fight and die for their country.

One study comparing Norwegians and Pakistanis shows the risk that the child dies during labor increases by 50 percent. The risk of death due to autosomal recessive disorders -- e.g., cystic fibrosis and spinal muscular atrophy -- is 18 times higher. Risk of death due to malformations is 10 times higher.

Immigrants who are not Danish citizens are banished from Denmark if they commit violent crimes.

This prevents foreigners from coming to Denmark who have plans to have a lot of children and live off the state&#039;s child support system.

Definitely stay focused on that. Basically, in Islam, there&#039;s no concept of truth. What&#039;s true is only what&#039;s convenient for your goals at the time. I&#039;m not making a sarcastic statement here-- the doctrine of Islam is that we must submit to Allah&#039;s will, no matter how capricious and illogical it is. Allah and Muhammad are dominating figures. If Allah wants 2+2 to equal five, or for time and causality to go backwards, all reality is his to command. He is beyond our reckoning, and attempting to circumscribe him with our own logic is blasphemous. As we are the playthings of Allah, so too are the kafir the playthings of Muslims. <br><br>Compare this to the Christian God, who is likewise infinitely powerful, but also infinitely benevolent. God has made promises to his followers, and while he in theory can make the sky green and water taste like strawberries, he doesn&#039;t, because he has promised us a stable world in which we can make our own choices. Though human sin apparently hurts him he bears it, the same way we are supposed to bear the slights and insults of others. I&#039;m no christian, I wasn&#039;t raised in the tradition, but if I had to choose, I&#039;d live in a christian society in any era of history. <br><br>Islam has had slavery basically since its inception.

But at this point, it isn&#039;t blind stereotyping to know that something is deeply wrong with Islam. I&#039;m sure you can find the appropriate medical analog, but when 99% of terror attacks are carried out by Muslims...it is only rational to conclude that Islam might be the cause.<br><br>(Perhaps akin to when 99% of your fibromyalgia cases are drug seekers. It would be common-sense to treat those cases with skepticism.)<br><br>So yes, blind stereotypes are damaging...but I think we&#039;ve seen more than enough evidence to take a second look at Islam.<br><br>I am absolutely sick and tired of our reaction to these attacks consisting of nothing but mouthing meaningless platitudes to the victims, tweeting #notallmuslims, and waiting for the next attack. <br><br>I have Muslim friends too, and every single one has expressed a very sincere horror with regards to terrorism. But, I&#039;ve also asked them why Islam never went through a Reformation period...the answer was that Quranic scripture is seen as straight from Allah, and cannot be changed. Therefore, Islam will forever be plagued with verses that advocate or justify terrorism. (e.g.: Surah 9:29, 9:73, 9:123, and chapters in the Hadiths) <br><br>So, the moderate (very westernized) Muslims I&#039;ve discussed this with have a real sense of impotence...which honestly I don&#039;t think is warranted. Because who else is going to change their religion but them?<br><br>Our moderate Muslims need to be called out for not regulating their own religion and communities.<br><br>There are two possibilities with regards to Islam:<br><br>1. Islam is a religion that considers itself at war with the West and duly cultivates terrorizing fanatics to conduct that war.<br><br>OR<br><br>2. Islam is a religion of peace... but a significant faction of its most religious adherents misinterpret it (so utterly) that they can justify fanatic killing sprees.","filename":"islam_01","ext":".jpg","w":584,"h":418,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":89,"tim":1493493934830,"time":1493493934,"md5":"TDXvcyX+5v41Xgcr1KpwNw==","fsize":26746,"resto":123362944,"id":"Mc+IbO6p","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123369485,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)15:25:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123363953\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123363953<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;return of the jihadi <\/span><br>ftfy","time":1493493949,"resto":123362944,"id":"o3tKVh0n","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123369577,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)15:26:36","name":"anonymous","com":"Online-Survey-of-Muslims-Topline-Po<wbr>ll-Data.pdf<br>2015 (Jyllands Posten): 77% of Muslims in Denmark believe the Quran&#039;s instructions should be &#039;fully appied&#039;.<br>http:\/\/www.thelocal.dk\/20151013\/dan<wbr>ish-muslims-more-devout-than-in-yea<wbr>rs-past<br><br>2015 (Jyllands Postn): Only 53% of Danish Muslims believe Danish law should be based on the consitution and not the Quran.<br>http:\/\/www.thelocal.dk\/20151019\/for<wbr>ty-percent-danish-muslims-wants-qur<wbr>an-based-laws<br><br>ICM Poll (2016): 23% of British Muslim support the introduction of Sharia in the UK &quot;instead of British Law&quot;<br>http:\/\/www.dailymail.co.uk\/news\/art<wbr>icle-3532355\/More-half-Muslims-want<wbr>-gay-sex-outlawed-nearly-quarter-su<wbr>pport-areas-UK-run-sharia-law.html<br><br>ICM Poll (2016): 21% of British Muslims decline to condemn stoning adulterers (5% openly support them).<br>http:\/\/www.dailymail.co.uk\/news\/art<wbr>icle-3532355\/More-half-Muslims-want<wbr>-gay-sex-outlawed-nearly-quarter-su<wbr>pport-areas-UK-run-sharia-law.html <br><br>Pew Research (2016): A majority of Muslims in 10 countries favor basing laws on the Quran (inc.

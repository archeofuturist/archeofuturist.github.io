The troubling reality being referred to is the widespread practice of Muslim inbreeding and the birth defects and social ills that it spawns.<br><br>The tragic effect of the left\u2019s control of the boundaries of debate is that any discussion about vital issues such as these marks an individual as an \u201cIslamophobe\u201d and a \u201cracist.\u201d A person who dares to point at the pathology of inbreeding in the Muslim community is accused of whipping up hatred against Muslim people. But all of this could not be further from the truth. To fight against inbreeding anywhere is to defend humanity and to defend innocent babies from birth defects. Fighting against this Islamic practice stems from a pro-Muslim calling, since identifying destructive ideologies and practices in Islam enables the protection of the Muslim people from harm.<br><br>Massive inbreeding among Muslims has been going on since their prophet allowed first-cousin marriages more than 50 generations (1,400 years) ago. For many Muslims, therefore, intermarriage is regarded as being part of their religion. In many Muslim communities, it is a source of social status to marry one&#039;s daughter or son to his or her cousin. Intermarriage also ensures that wealth is kept within the family. Islam\u2019s strict authoritarianism plays a large role as well: keeping daughters and sons close gives families more power to control and decide their choices and lifestyles.","filename":"1491312586955","ext":".jpg","w":839,"h":740,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":110,"tim":1493492325385,"time":1493492325,"md5":"PyRhU4ngMP7\/dzZEU2ETMw==","fsize":160766,"resto":123362944,"id":"gbBpiu1r","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123366165,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)14:59:00","name":"Anonymous","filename":"1480272374100","ext":".jpg","w":2927,"h":3583,"tn_w":102,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493492340285,"time":1493492340,"md5":"laAp4Bke8sa1dDMn9p0E9A==","fsize":2595696,"resto":123362944,"id":"GBh8+EF2","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":123366172,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)14:59:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123363358\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123363358<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;pedophilia, wanton killing of innocents, and idolatry isn&#039;t degenerate<\/span><br><br>kys fag","filename":"ataturk","ext":".jpg","w":850,"h":400,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":58,"tim":1493492344463,"time":1493492344,"md5":"d+scblchoTK6kYLt+2MRLw==","fsize":68505,"resto":123362944,"id":"8NV8LMPV","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123366226,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)14:59:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123366130\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123366130<\/a><br><br>Westerners have a historical tradition of being ready to fight and die for their country.

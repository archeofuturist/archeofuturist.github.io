You need to understand the purpose of a government backed housing loan is so that someone who wouldn&#039;t normally be able to make repayments can get a loan since the government backing skews risk assessment. If you think fixing a loan interest minimum (or even more pertinently, a housing price maximum) is a solution you are retarded. I say housing price maximum because the increase in home buying thanks to the cheap loans, even with a fixed interest minimum would inflate prices which will lead to a bubble, if not quite as bad because the higher interest rate would decrease the rate of borrowing slightly. It&#039;s a bad idea because say you&#039;re looking to sell your house and you&#039;re a mcmansion in a safe neighborhood and down the street is an old shitbox in need of renovation, and you get told if you want to sell your house you need to price it at the same value as the house down the street because you both have hit maximum value just off property location. You&#039;d feel like you were getting robbed and wouldn&#039;t want to sell. You could try to fix this by saying the loans are only applied to housing purchases below a certain price rather than fixing the market itself but this also leads to a certain problem, the lowest quality houses would be driven up to the loan maximum and poor people would find it absolutely impossible to get a home without having an insurmountable pile of debt that is totally unrepresentative of the quality of their housing.<br><br>tl;dr there is no feasible solution to the housing market when you have such extensive government subsidization of lending.","time":1491019405,"resto":119130562,"id":"f7Y\/gLAb","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"}]}

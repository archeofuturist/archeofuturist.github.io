It&#039;s multi-sourced and for multiple reasons.<br><br>First off - Money. NATO wants control of that pipeline. Or they want their allies in control of that pipeline, which their allies are not currently in control of both pipelines, only one. Syria and Russia are in control of the 2nd pipeline. Who do you hear about all day long is the big bad evil? Syria and Russia. Yet their pipeline supplies oil to Europe, so they can&#039;t be barbaric, however they make money from that and NATO wants that money all for themselves. Or at least a cut of it, which its not getting any right now.","filename":"1491474386774","ext":".jpg","w":700,"h":460,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":164,"tim":1491482353580,"time":1491482353,"md5":"vbn+GivMw7ySnuGMkWjmiQ==","fsize":108866,"resto":0,"id":"armxZ85Q","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"purpose-of-smearing-assad","country_name":"United States","replies":23,"images":12,"unique_ips":12},{"no":119738484,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)08:40:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"Elephant in the room: The terrorists are the only side left with chemical weapons","filename":"terrorists-have-chemical-weapons","ext":".jpg","w":1054,"h":1093,"tn_w":120,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491482417617,"time":1491482417,"md5":"gbuxLMyk+SByJCwGZhCk8g==","fsize":367342,"resto":119738402,"id":"5u\/iFnea","country":"AU","m_img":1,"country_name":"Australia"},{"no":119738507,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)08:40:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;NATO wants control of that pipeline<\/span><br>Irrelevant.

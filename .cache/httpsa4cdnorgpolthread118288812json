in addition to benefitting exports from Northern farms and manufacturers.[5] Grant privately speculated that US control would help compel Brazil, Puerto Rico, and Cuba to abolish slavery.[5] Grant also speculated that if African Americans from the Southeastern United States had the option of emigration to the island, violent European American supremacist groups in the South, such as the Ku Klux Klan, would have to curb their use of violence against African Americans or lose their cheaper labour. Grant, however, was cautious in directly advocating African American emigration to the Dominican Republic.[5] Fearing Britain might take control, Grant also mentioned the need to maintain the Monroe Doctrine.<\/span><br><br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Annex<wbr>ation_of_Santo_Domingo","time":1490487943,"resto":118288812,"id":"NR4X07d0","country":"DO","country_name":"Dominican Republic"},{"no":118295173,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)20:26:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118294992\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118294992<\/a><br><br>they would&#039;ve shilled for rand and ron paul even if they were not in the race.","time":1490487971,"resto":118288812,"id":"SMuQodTR","country":"MX","country_name":"Mexico"},{"no":118295257,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)20:26:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118288812\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118288812<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;be white mexican<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;be red pilled<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;support trump as much as I can<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;still have to fight an unlimited amount of left wing shitskins that hate trump<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;come to \/pol\/ just to get mocked at and never ever be taken seriously because of the flag on my posts<\/span><br><br>so this is what it feels to be a war hero","time":1490488014,"resto":118288812,"id":"69e8Rfgv","country":"MX","country_name":"Mexico"},{"no":118295828,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)20:31:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118294992\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118294992<\/a><br><br>the main thing here is that Trump managed to get advantage of a political and social situation that was already there.

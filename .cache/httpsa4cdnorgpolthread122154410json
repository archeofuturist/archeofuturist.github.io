She fucks around, does not couple with a man, her uterus shrivels, and she artificially relieves her mother instinct by stimulating\/abusing her instinct and hormones by taking care of pets, instead of children, as originally &quot;designed&quot; through natural selection, her biological urge to give birth is put to sleep by social conventions (overpopulation meme, feminism,...) and she becomes barren, she does not reproduce and as such her life is worthless from a natural point of view.<br>This is obviously not good for modern society, where prole negroes and islamic polygamists will outnumber decent, smart people, but the law of nature does not care for society.

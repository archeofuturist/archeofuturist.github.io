But a dictatorship may be a necessary system for a transitional period. At times it is necessary for a country to have, for a time, some form or other of dictatorial power. As you will understand, it is possible for a dictator to govern in a liberal way. And it is also possible for a democracy to govern with a total lack of liberalism. Personally I prefer a liberal dictator to democratic government lacking liberalism. My personal impression \u2014 and this is valid for South America \u2014 is that in Chile, for example, we will witness a transition from a dictatorial government to a liberal government. And during this transition it may be necessary to maintain certain dictatorial powers, not as something permanent, but as a temporary arrangement. &quot; - Hayek","time":1493076662,"resto":122634473,"id":"Zej\/CnEz","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122656374,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)19:31:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122656103\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122656103<\/a><br>Yes, this is Ghost and Mrs Ghost","filename":"ghost3","ext":".png","w":960,"h":958,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":124,"tim":1493076672859,"time":1493076672,"md5":"mpgvrrQDAS1Xd5VcKgMdoQ==","fsize":1916351,"resto":122634473,"id":"b4h7Rw2l","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122656420,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)19:31:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122655857\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122655857<\/a><br>Pinochet was a very healthy variant of authority.","time":1493076694,"resto":122634473,"id":"Z4Hlh4Xa","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122656646,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)19:33:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122655258\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122655258<\/a><br><a href=\"#p122656374\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122656374<\/a><br>But ghost doesn&#039;t have a daughter he has a son.","time":1493076802,"resto":122634473,"id":"Exau5NXQ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122656679,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)19:33:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122656374\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122656374<\/a><br>how do you know thats not his daughter?","time":1493076817,"resto":122634473,"id":"Zej\/CnEz","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122656734,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)19:34:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122656646\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122656646<\/a><br>thats ghosts wifes son","time":1493076844,"resto":122634473,"id":"Zej\/CnEz","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122656779,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)19:34:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122656374\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122656374<\/a><br><br>Ghost has a gay son.","time":1493076865,"resto":122634473,"id":"+G5m1PpD","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122656890,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)19:35:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122656779\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122656779<\/a><br>nah ghosts son likes asian","time":1493076902,"resto":122634473,"id":"Zej\/CnEz","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122656899,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)19:35:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122656679\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122656679<\/a><br><a href=\"#p122656646\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122656646<\/a><br>he said he has a granddaughter","time":1493076907,"resto":122634473,"id":"RsXE\/o8D","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122656979,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)19:35:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122655258\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122655258<\/a><br><a href=\"#p122656103\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122656103<\/a><br><a href=\"#p122656324\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122656324<\/a><br><a href=\"#p122656374\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122656374<\/a><br><a href=\"#p122656646\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122656646<\/a><br><a href=\"#p122656899\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122656899<\/a>","filename":"4Reddit","ext":".png","w":324,"h":416,"tn_w":97,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493076943067,"time":1493076943,"md5":"Pi8mz3dXcuRk7ICRY6HOKw==","fsize":22823,"resto":122634473,"id":"Z4Hlh4Xa","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122656986,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)19:35:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"That &quot;evacuation&quot; is fake news, ghost.","time":1493076947,"resto":122634473,"id":"Z5t2UYOi","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122657013,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)19:36:00","name":"Nathan Bedford Forrest","com":"<a href=\"#p122656324\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122656324<\/a><br><br>If those Vietnam claims are true, he would have to be 60-61 at least.<br><br>The youngest American Vietnam veteran would&#039;ve been born in 1957 (excluding those who forged birth certificates to enlist at a younger age was the case with Dan Bullock).","time":1493076960,"resto":122634473,"id":"Mcbmz9ur","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122657250,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)19:37:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122656119\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122656119<\/a><br>Never said they were.

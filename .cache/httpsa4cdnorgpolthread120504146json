Even a good major from a joke college is still pretty worthless. <br>The fact that girls claw their parents eyes out to get them to pay for a shit college means they are MORE STUPID than their male counterparts who realize college is a liberal meme. <br>Most girls at princeton were the cut throat overachiever type who did nothing in high school but study. There were guys at princeton who did the same in high school but i didnt notice there being near as many. I think alot of the girls in college live in a falllacy world where they think intelligence is grown through hard work rather than donated to them at birth through their parents genes. The only subject that will grow your intelligence are the math\/science course you take between age 10 and 16. By 16 you are as capable as youre going to be. Of course you keep learning but knowledge is not the same as intellectual vertical (how high your mind can leap). <br>Ive read a study somewhere clocking females as 5 pts behind males on avg, which isnt that much, but the critical part is that the tails on the bell curve for females arent as thick. This means their are less female retards than male retards, but it also means their are less female geniuses than male geniuses. <br>Sucks to be a feminist in the age of free information, doesnt it?","filename":"IMG_0921","ext":".png","w":2001,"h":1125,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1491865124808,"time":1491865124,"md5":"gCXBSL+CzyPvfKlnO3Srrw==","fsize":1881842,"resto":120504146,"id":"tT+bLbLx","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":120507123,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)19:00:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"Here&#039;s a real source instead of someone&#039;s blog.<br>https:\/\/collegepuzzle.stanford.edu\/<wbr>?tag=women-exceed-men-in-college-gr<wbr>aduation","time":1491865231,"resto":120504146,"id":"YDf282Ag","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120507508,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)19:03:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"Men aren&#039;t stupid enough to go a hundred thousand in debt for a worthless Fashion Merchandising degree from a for profit school like American InterContinental.","filename":"aiu","ext":".jpg","w":1000,"h":562,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1491865411702,"time":1491865411,"md5":"NCzGvhrFxCuNZvUFN6twGA==","fsize":47852,"resto":120504146,"id":"IcbN9AJb","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

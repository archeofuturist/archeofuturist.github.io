So you&#039;re lucky because other than learning different words, you have to do nothing as we share the same grammatical roots. <br>I&#039;d say keep on reading but also watch italian dubbed movies with french subs, then after awhile switch to italian dub and italian sub. Do it with movies you&#039;ve already seen in french. Also download Duolingo for your phone, it&#039;s a pretty based app and I&#039;ve used it alot for improving my french. One last thing, if you play games try to hang with italians (i know, its bad, but forcing yourself to interact with people and making them understand you is a very good practice method). <br>I&#039;d leave the accent thing, napolitan is recognized as a different language than italian, which is also completey different from sicilian, calabrese and Apuliese. There&#039;s no point in learning them and people from center\/north can barely understand them so it&#039;s kind of the opposite: those guys need to learn speak italian most of the time. <br><br><a href=\"#p122726279\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122726279<\/a><br>Nice to hear, Toscana, Marche, Umbria and some Lazio are top tier when it comes to mountain towns.

What would cost 100\/150k in center-north, you could find at 50\/100k in south in teh same situation. But buying things in south italy has much more implications for obvious reasons. Then it depends on the town. Some towns are really amazing, all renewed, very touristic, perfectly kept, lot of services and all. A 2 floors house there would even reach 200k (or even 300k on extreme cases) depending on the distance from the town&#039;s center. Also what makes a huge difference is if the house has been renewd in the past years. Some of those houses are a century old if not more.","time":1493122452,"resto":122723247,"id":"ATw4zrui","country":"IT","country_name":"Italy"},{"no":122727514,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)08:14:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122726472\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122726472<\/a><br>Frig off Manolo.

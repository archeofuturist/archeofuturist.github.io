There main problem with its weighting is it underestimates the young voter. It is true old baby boomers tend to vote more than gen xyz but this general election is going to be different. Corbyn is going for the 4chan and online communities for his campaign. I am not convinced this will work but stranger things have happened. My advice is that any survey you see check the weighing for under 25 year old voters. If they have skewed it too much the survey results are useless. Also be careful to check if it is an online\/phone or street survey. Landline surveys are pointless. Mobile phones are 50\/50 and online will be the most reliable this time round. Whatever, just don`t take anything on face value unless you like the feel of a slimy Marxist cock up you arse for the next 5 years.","time":1492689665,"resto":121984563,"id":"XKJq\/BE4","country":"JP","country_name":"Japan"},{"no":121987587,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)08:01:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121987461\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121987461<\/a><br>Fuck off","time":1492689670,"resto":121984563,"id":"vKHznxGt","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121987591,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)08:01:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121987525\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121987525<\/a><br>No","filename":"1487984343680","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":640,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492689672237,"time":1492689672,"md5":"G3FPOKuoM+Ca2benG4tKeQ==","fsize":82884,"resto":121984563,"id":"n+EuYuIT","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121987602,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)08:01:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;tfw you&#039;ve just realised we might get to see this again on Daily Politics<\/span><br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=xyL<wbr>vUTO4_M4<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;tfw you realise this was two years ago already<\/span>","filename":"adamclifford6","ext":".png","w":809,"h":377,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":58,"tim":1492689680890,"time":1492689680,"md5":"JYWjybFhQQS4NS52LqAT3g==","fsize":497484,"resto":121984563,"id":"rkLmZ78E","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121987615,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)08:01:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"BEADY PARTY DOING WELL IN OPINION POLLS.<br><br>ARE YOU TIRED OF THE DIMINISHING AMOUNT AND QUALITY OF OUR MOST VITAL, LIFE SUSTAINING SUBSTANCE - ARYAN BLOOD?<br><br>ARE YOU TIRED OF ARYANS RUNNING RAMPANT IN THE STREETS - THE BLOOD CONSTABULARY OVERSTRETCHED AND UNDERFUNDED?<br><br>ARE YOU TIRED OF THE CONTINUING NON-AGGRESSION POLICY THAT WE CONTINUALLY PURSUE WITH THEIR ARYAN NATION?<br><br>WE PROMISE TO OPEN SIX NEW BLOOD REFINERIES ACROSS THE NORTH OF ENGLAND AND CREATE FOUR NEW REFINERY SHIPS.<br><br>A VOTE FOR THE BEADY PARTY IS A VOTE FOR A REAL ARYANDIED.<br><br>WE WILL REINSTATE THE NATIONAL ALLOWANCE OF ARYANBLOOD.

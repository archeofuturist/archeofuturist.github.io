We had bigger problems than flying to moon; repairing country from communistic menace and so on. And your culture wasn&#039;t THAT expansive in Poland either. This process maybe sped up a bit only 10 years ago. In 90s, most people didn&#039;t had access to cable television like nowadays, so shit like MTV was mostly out of question. In 90s, we also had shitload of great Polish movies produced, without much American influence at all. One film, ,,Happy New York&quot;, was really sad as fuck movie about ,,american dream&quot;, and the harsh reality of immigration. My pops always viewed american films as infantile, cliche, and stupid. ,,They killed him and he run away&quot;, ,,Zabili go i uciek\u0142&quot; films. Soviet era movies has much more to offer, and these are still popular in Poland.<br><br>Welp, in general, while America is strong country, it&#039;s not comfy like rural Poland. Or Belgium\/Switzerland\/rural Europe in general. I wouldn&#039;t mind try moving to Alaska or some rural red states, but I like my Scotland for now.","time":1490180908,"resto":117723205,"id":"kzV1uGDf","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":117748286,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)07:13:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117746545\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117746545<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I have changed my likes to countries with more interesting culture, like Japan or England<\/span><br>What&#039;s interesting about modern-day England?

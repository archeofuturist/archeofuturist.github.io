If you have poo in loos or whites their differential success will cause resentment.<br>2) No \/ minimal nigger culture - TV \/ radio in Caribbean countries is mostly from South America which has some Catholic influences on its major broadcasters to keep the degeneracy down. Internet will ruin this though.<br>3) No abortions. Condoms are probably a good thing, and the pill is very expensive. Encourages marriage.<br>4) Christianity or Islam. Obviously Christianity is better b\/c there are less hard and fast laws and more general principles - this means that there can be more local influence into the religion which makes people like it more. <br>5) The main thing is marriage. You can have a civilization with 85 IQ people, as plenty of East African and Caribbean countries demonstrate, as long as female hypergamy and male competition for harems is constrained.

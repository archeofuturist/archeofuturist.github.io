Erdogan&#039;s a fucking faggot sometimes, but he deserves credit for standing up to this sick, deranged view of mankind.","filename":"1492206048155","ext":".jpg","w":1200,"h":525,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":54,"tim":1492388257056,"time":1492388257,"md5":"hEWOkSZ9RjuHCrdHPdfDJA==","fsize":124574,"resto":121439026,"id":"2tN6r+Xe","country":"GB","m_img":1,"country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121446932,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)20:24:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121439026\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121439026<\/a><br>We&#039;re gonna fuck the scumbag United Russia over in 2018","time":1492388660,"resto":121439026,"id":"ZVP8Fmfi","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":121447028,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)20:25:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121446932\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121446932<\/a><br>What&#039;s your political position?","time":1492388703,"resto":121439026,"id":"2tN6r+Xe","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121447197,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)20:26:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121447028\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121447028<\/a><br>Classical liberal","time":1492388782,"resto":121439026,"id":"ZVP8Fmfi","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":121447497,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)20:28:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121446932\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121446932<\/a><br>yeaaaah... unless","filename":"i","ext":".jpg","w":573,"h":521,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":113,"tim":1492388896205,"time":1492388896,"md5":"H\/F\/VhXKhdxIeK8Bp4PWug==","fsize":30816,"resto":121439026,"id":"bwbwqg3v","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":121447880,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)20:31:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121447197\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121447197<\/a><br>lol cuck.

The United States also informed the world that Alan Shepard would make a space journey in the spacecraft Freedom 7 on 5 May, 1961.<br><br>The Soviet Union was forced to do something to save face. For this reason a Soviet cosmonaut, Vladimir Ilyushin, was sent up into space on 7 April, 1961. The Americans intercepted several radio communications between him and the space centre in the Soviet Union. Ilyushin&#039;s landing failed and he was seriously injured. He could not be shown to the public. It was claimed that he had been injured in a car accident. He was sent to China to receive better medical treatment.<br><br>The Soviet Union did not have a spare capsule at that time and in Moscow it was decided to orchestrate a huge bluff, a cosmic lie.<br><br>This hoax was sloppily orchestrated. Polish newspapers announced already on the morning of 12 April that a Soviet cosmonaut had been in space. Newspapers in other countries did not report Gagarin&#039;s flight until 13 April.","filename":"GagarinRussia[1]","ext":".jpg","w":473,"h":461,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":121,"tim":1492336170920,"time":1492336170,"md5":"WsqH4Fu4B7MP+s1IB8p5Dw==","fsize":51053,"resto":121340793,"id":"mYnwemBI","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":121342983,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)05:58:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121340793\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121340793<\/a><br>something something moon landing<br><br>something something intel x86<br><br>something something microsoft wangblows<br><br>something something selinux<br><br>Whatever, niggerfaggot.","filename":"1491979133944","ext":".png","w":852,"h":1256,"tn_w":84,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492336683606,"time":1492336683,"md5":"ixU6whjD99IAh4Ah2Zr7sA==","fsize":56320,"resto":121340793,"id":"ZX7xIvtS","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121343080,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)05:59:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121340793\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121340793<\/a><br>fun fact, America and the USSR faked the race since it was a war of propaganda. <br>Humanity got into space much later around the 80s-90s.","time":1492336770,"resto":121340793,"id":"J8\/OOChs","country":"BG","country_name":"Bulgaria"},{"no":121343175,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)06:01:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121340793\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121340793<\/a><br>Russia was always stronger country than USA in space tech.<br>Only achievement that USA got was first man on the moon.<br>Now they don&#039;t even have a way to send people to space anymore.","time":1492336873,"resto":121340793,"id":"5BC7px3+","country":"SI","country_name":"Slovenia"},{"no":121343702,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)06:09:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121340793\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121340793<\/a><br>Russia, has a better education system then America in the 50&#039;s. <br>America become too relax after WWII.

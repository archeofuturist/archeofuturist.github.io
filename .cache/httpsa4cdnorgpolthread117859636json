I&#039;m growing more and more disdain and contempt because I can&#039;t find anyone else to hangout with. <br><br>Is it the same in every other country? Is it just an age thing? I&#039;m 24. Slowly my friends are just being shrivel dicks and have no drive to do anything after work. They don&#039;t chase women, they don&#039;t leave the house, they all play videogames and now I get excluded because im assuming they&#039;re tired of me pushing things like outdoor sports and socializing. I hate libs, I hate millennials. Where do you go to find new friends? Is no-friends my only option? <br><br>How many of you lead successful lives without hanging out old friends? <br><br><br>I swear if we were a tribe, we&#039;d be French. Just a bunch of dreamers and push overs that only know how to keep their heads down and work.

Everything is the easy way out but they defend their claims pretty well. I can&#039;t argue with the logic of after 40 hrs of working you can do whatever you want..

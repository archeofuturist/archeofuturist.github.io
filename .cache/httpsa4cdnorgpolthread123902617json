Thank you. It&#039;s a bit clearer now. <br>It&#039;s difficult learning this on your own using a book written so long ago, which is why I am so gratefull to Mr Grote for his chapter notes. Unfortunately, I don&#039;t live in a metropolis so finding a friendly Latin teacher nearby isn&#039;t really an option.<br>I will stick at it though. I believe in lifelong learning, and try to learn something new every day, even if it doesn&#039;t seem to have immediate practical applications.<br>Thank you for your help, everybody.<br>Gratias tibi (I think that&#039;s right).","time":1493818020,"resto":123902617,"id":"IYd45w9K","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123911935,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)09:28:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123902617\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123902617<\/a><br><br>Let&#039;s bring our glory back","time":1493818114,"resto":123902617,"id":"B77siIum","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":123912093,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)09:30:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123911935\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123911935<\/a><br>France knows what&#039;s up, Vivat Europa!","time":1493818228,"resto":123902617,"id":"kRakop8O","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123912330,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)09:33:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123911800\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123911800<\/a><br>Si Vales Bene Est, Ego Valeo.","time":1493818414,"resto":123902617,"id":"kRakop8O","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123912574,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)09:36:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"If you can&#039;t read Latin you are a disgrace to Western Civilization.","time":1493818585,"resto":123902617,"id":"wUhBwMHm","country":"AR","country_name":"Argentina"},{"no":123912783,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)09:38:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123912330\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123912330<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Si Vales Bene Est, Ego Valeo.<\/span><br>If it&#039;s good to be strong, then I will be strong?","time":1493818733,"resto":123902617,"id":"IYd45w9K","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123912881,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)09:40:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123910608\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123910608<\/a><br>Yep but by learning Italian pronounciation it still becomes easier to learn Latin which was my point.","time":1493818817,"resto":123902617,"id":"oOGmVR9t","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":123913265,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)09:45:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123909438\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123909438<\/a><br>Sorry Again?","time":1493819101,"resto":123902617,"id":"imkPOUTn","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":123913287,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)09:45:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123910608\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123910608<\/a><br><br>How you fucking dare illiterate yankee?

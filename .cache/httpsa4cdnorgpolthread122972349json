At tzar bomba size or bigger a lot of the energy goes up and out of the atmosphere and is wasted.","time":1493267428,"resto":122972349,"id":"kCwPfebZ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122995173,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)00:33:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122972349\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122972349<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The United States possesses more space weaponry than any other country<\/span><br><br>http:\/\/blogs.reuters.com\/great-deba<wbr>te\/2015\/08\/09\/the-u-s-military-is-p<wbr>reparing-for-the-real-star-wars<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Russia reveals new generation satellite to fight war in space<\/span><br><br>http:\/\/www.dailystar.co.uk\/news\/lat<wbr>est-news\/476182\/Russia-developing-s<wbr>tar-wars-space-weapons<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Russia lost all of its early warning satellites in the spring of 2014.<\/span><br><br>http:\/\/www.spaceflightinsider.com\/m<wbr>issions\/defense\/russian-soyuz-2-1b-<wbr>rocket-successfully-launches-tundra<wbr>-satellite<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;two secret Soviet programs, &quot;Mercury&quot; and &quot;Volcano&quot;, aimed at developing a &quot;tectonic weapon&quot; that could set off earthquakes from great distance<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;US Secretary of Defense William S.

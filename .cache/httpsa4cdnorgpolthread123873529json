But seeing this was just enough to get me to come back, just long enough to make this thread. Why am i seeing this? Its not like i want women to fail in STEM, but why do i care? Why do they feel the need to put this bullshit on everyones PC? is there an agenda being played out that im not aware of? There have been way worse problems now and in the past that would warrant it being shoved in your face like this, but women in STEM? This is where windows decides to take action? There must be something going on.

What&#039;s up with that?<br><br>Also I can&#039;t speak fully with confidence about an agenda being pushed here but I think trying to make this connection between women and the STEM field is just trying to make people ignore or not realize that women are retarded. <br><br>STEM is difficult. Girls don&#039;t sign up for it because it&#039;s difficult. That&#039;s all it is. They try and insist they&#039;re magically held away from it by men when any man in those fields can tell you women are constantly bombarded with positive treatment for being the only girl in the middle of a sausage fest.<br><br>Basically women don&#039;t want to own up to their irresponsibility and anti-intellectual mentalities that lead to them avoiding more difficult career fields because of her own vanity. She&#039;s gotta keep up her &quot;I&#039;m equal to any man!&quot; tough-go-girl narrative, but when reality says otherwise she&#039;s gotta make an excuse for it.

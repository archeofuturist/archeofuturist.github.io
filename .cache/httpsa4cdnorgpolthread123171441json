Getting a 10% increase in value within a couple hours doesn&#039;t mean anything if you don&#039;t have the funds to buy a relevant amount of them. And if you do, that 10% spike was probably due to you.<br><br>General rule of thumb (when looking at the last ~25 years, obviously you can&#039;t predict the future) is that you can at least withdraw 4% of your investment per year without lowering the total amount of invested money (i.e. that&#039;s what your investment will historically make in minimum profits after taxes and everything). So every $300 you invest mean $1 you get per month for as long as the market doesn&#039;t crash.<br>And that&#039;s a conservative value, you can probably take a good amount more.","time":1493376060,"resto":123171441,"id":"3iPal67v","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":123179878,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)06:41:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123179725\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123179725<\/a><br><br>Albania of peace and prosperity","time":1493376078,"resto":123171441,"id":"vSMhy3tF","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123179893,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)06:41:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123179645\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123179645<\/a><br>Then you realize all the China was outsourced to Canada","time":1493376092,"resto":123171441,"id":"voaqaKGt","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123179976,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)06:42:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123179647\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123179647<\/a><br>Do different boots have different flavors","time":1493376148,"resto":123171441,"id":"ok4NfrEa","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123180038,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)06:43:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123179878\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123179878<\/a><br>at least we dont have niggers,gays and feminism","time":1493376194,"resto":123171441,"id":"3AV17Hkl","country":"AL","country_name":"Albania"},{"no":123180061,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)06:43:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123179976\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123179976<\/a><br>I&#039;ve never been a fan of powerplay personally. <br>I presume you&#039;d know though.","time":1493376211,"resto":123171441,"id":"VHNFkuNB","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123180089,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)06:43:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123180038\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123180038<\/a><br>But you are the niggers","time":1493376225,"resto":123171441,"id":"YzmZH3UI","country":"RS","country_name":"Serbia"},{"no":123180211,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)06:44:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123180089\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123180089<\/a><br>fucking albanians","time":1493376295,"resto":123171441,"id":"UtqLY3zB","country":"IT","country_name":"Italy"},{"no":123180266,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)06:45:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"Inflation is a constant.

Unemployment doesn&#039;t necessarily move, and the fixation on that is mostly because people are stupid and it&#039;s easy to fathom job vs no job. Instead, all you can say is that minimum wage will distort the market away from its natural state.

That&#039;s not easy to measure.<br><br>I can&#039;t remember her name, but several years ago someone did another localized study and found that that substitution effects were major contributors. The job participation rate of upper middle class white girls in the studied area shot up and the unemployment rate of poor blacks (particularly males) also shot up. The less productive poor folks were no longer able to sell their services for less, and the white girls were more likely to prefer hours of work over leisure or other activities since the pay was higher. Sure, unemployment didn&#039;t change, but the end result was that the people supposedly being helped by minimum wage were the ones harmed by it.","time":1493377589,"resto":123171441,"id":"r159yQUu","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123181925,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)07:06:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123181743\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123181743<\/a><br>He&#039;s a lazy piece of shit, so obviously you must be too.","time":1493377603,"resto":123171441,"id":"VHNFkuNB","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123181999,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)07:07:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123180547\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123180547<\/a><br>not really scared, more like disgusted.

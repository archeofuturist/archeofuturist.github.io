They have been planning for this exact war for sixty years. Any conflict with North Korea will definitely see a huge amount of damage done to South Korea, and Seoul is important enough to the region&#039;s (and the world&#039;s) economy that no one really wants to see it shut down (or destroyed) for an extended period of time.","time":1493006730,"resto":122530259,"id":"nZkNVU6y","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122540580,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)00:11:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122537662\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122537662<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;he&#039;s not seeking military intervention now<\/span><br>I&#039;m gonna need a sorce on that, senpai.","time":1493007076,"resto":122530259,"id":"zPXn9M+3","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122540645,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)00:11:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122540580\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122540580<\/a><br>source*","time":1493007111,"resto":122530259,"id":"zPXn9M+3","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

Apparently they work together with ANTIFA, and were involved in the fight with Traditionalist Workers&#039; Party in Sacramento, as well as the various recent fights with Trump supporters.<br>Now, I knew from experience that lefty groups are cultish, but these guys take it to a whole different, Scientology-tier level. They take in troubled youths, psychologically abuse them, cut them off from their families, try to break down their ego, and attempt to prevent them from leaving.<br>Some former members have documented what they went through, and it&#039;s a pretty interesting read:<br>https:\/\/secretsurvivorsofbamn.wordp<wbr>ress.com\/<br>(the authors are still leftist, but the fact that even other leftists think the BAMN is cultish is saying something)<br><br>Anybody had any experience with these folks?

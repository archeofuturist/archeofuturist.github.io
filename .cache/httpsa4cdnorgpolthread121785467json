Apparently they work together with ANTIFA, and were involved in the fight with Traditionalist Workers&#039; Party in Sacramento, as well as the various recent fights with Trump supporters.<br>Now, I knew from experience that lefty groups are cultish, but these guys take it to a whole different, Scientology-tier level. They take in troubled youths, psychologically abuse them, cut them off from their families, try to break down their ego, and attempt to prevent them from leaving.<br>Some former members have documented what they went through, and it&#039;s a pretty interesting read:<br>https:\/\/secretsurvivorsofbamn.wordp<wbr>ress.com\/<br>(the authors are still leftist, but the fact that even other leftists think the BAMN is cultish is saying something)<br><br>Anybody had any experience with these folks? This sounds like some real heinous, shady shit that needs to be brought out into the light.","filename":"yvette-felarca-bamn","ext":".jpg","w":676,"h":480,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":177,"tim":1492568424145,"time":1492568424,"md5":"PZD46yLBjtEr6dWjmYbAMQ==","fsize":99936,"resto":0,"id":"tAViSa9Z","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"bamn-a-trotskyist-brainwashing-cult","country_name":"United States","replies":12,"images":3,"unique_ips":6},{"no":121786233,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)22:26:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"Come on \/pol\/.

When you&#039;re still infantile of the mind you&#039;re limited to children&#039;s works. Nevermind the fact that this work in particular is one of the dullest franchises in the history of movie franchises. Seriously each episode following the boy wizard and his pals from Hogwarts Academy as they fight assorted villains has been indistinguishable from the others. Aside from the gloomy imagery, the series\u2019 only consistency has been its lack of excitement and ineffective use of special effects, all to make magic unmagical, to make action seem inert.<br><br>Perhaps the die was cast when Rowling vetoed the idea of Spielberg directing the series; she made sure the series would never be mistaken for a work of art that meant anything to anybody, just ridiculously profitable cross-promotion for her books. The Harry Potter series might be anti-Christian (or not), but it\u2019s certainly the anti-James Bond series in its refusal of wonder, beauty and excitement. No one wants to face that fact. Now, thankfully, they no longer have to.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;a-at least the books were good though<\/span><br>&quot;No!&quot;<br>The writing is dreadful; the book was terrible. As I read, I noticed that every time a character went for a walk, the author wrote instead that the character &quot;stretched his legs.&quot;<br><br>I began marking on the back of an envelope every time that phrase was repeated. I stopped only after I had marked the envelope several dozen times. I was incredulous. Rowling&#039;s mind is so governed by cliches and dead metaphors that she has no other style of writing. Later I read a lavish, loving review of Harry Potter by the same Stephen King. He wrote something to the effect of, &quot;If these kids are reading Harry Potter at 11 or 12, then when they get older they will go on to read Stephen King.&quot; And he was quite right. He was not being ironic. When you read &quot;Harry Potter&quot; you are, in fact, trained to read Stephen King.","filename":"potter","ext":".jpg","w":1596,"h":2850,"tn_w":70,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493752387577,"time":1493752387,"md5":"18UHPhXvkYHfAyNAG6C\/Dw==","fsize":1236233,"resto":123800363,"id":"AktwFGyX","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":123805366,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)15:14:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123803025\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123803025<\/a><br>Yep<br>SPOILER- Cap kills him in the end (after Professor X&#039;s brain is removed from Red Skull), and takes over HYDRA","time":1493752460,"resto":123800363,"id":"weQdKr\/Y","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123805546,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)15:15:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123805191\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123805191<\/a><br>Harry potter was a god tier film series, are you legit retarded?","filename":"image","ext":".jpg","w":1696,"h":1280,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":94,"tim":1493752543988,"time":1493752543,"md5":"LF6yy57Vitw5+SuPOmipLw==","fsize":799860,"resto":123800363,"id":"IM9bmzuT","country":"CA","m_img":1,"country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123805601,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)15:16:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123805191\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123805191<\/a><br>LOTR is fantastic and redpilled af","time":1493752567,"resto":123800363,"id":"GRGdI9iw","country":"DK","country_name":"Denmark"},{"no":123805752,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)15:17:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123805148\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123805148<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;fucking leaf<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;suck a dog<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;dumbass<\/span><br>Reminder that this is the extent of a burgers language capability","filename":"image","ext":".jpg","w":879,"h":1183,"tn_w":92,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493752642048,"time":1493752642,"md5":"i4tZswYIoP8tya1V7xjRVg==","fsize":208479,"resto":123800363,"id":"IM9bmzuT","country":"CA","m_img":1,"country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123805956,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)15:18:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123804638\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123804638<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;skateboard on a moving surface<\/span>","time":1493752737,"resto":123800363,"id":"2wgG3dzc","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":123805970,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)15:19:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123801728\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123801728<\/a><br><a href=\"#p123802190\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123802190<\/a><br><a href=\"#p123803025\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123803025<\/a><br><a href=\"#p123803530\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123803530<\/a><br><a href=\"#p123804372\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123804372<\/a><br><br>You do know that he doesn&#039;t care about U.S.A?

With the exception of Hermione and Harry&#039;s mother, every wizard of any note is from an established wizard family. Even those with one non-wizard parent. The two main characters are even distant cousins. Wizard society functions as a &#039;natural aristocracy,&#039; magic is almost entirely hereditary. The interesting thing is that most of its members welcome the addition of the occasional instance of talented &#039;new blood&#039; to keep things fresh, with the exception of a handful of purist snobs. Provided that new blood is brought up in their circles and more or less surrenders their previous identity. This more or less exactly mirrors the class system that&#039;s traditionally existed in Britain, with &#039;muggle born&#039; wizards more or less the same as scholarship kids to exclusive independent schools. <br><br>But even though Rowling is basically a massive SJW, the ironic thing is she&#039;s benefitted from exactly this system after her own fashion and has been elevated into the real life equivalent of her wizarding world. And judging by the way most wizards are portrayed in her books (i.e. well intentioned towards the other ranks, but fundamentally oblivious to their actual lives in an endearing kind of way) she can&#039;t really find it in her heart to hate that system.","time":1493754738,"resto":123800363,"id":"+qODzjHb","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123810250,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)15:53:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123810097\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123810097<\/a><br>Where does the water go?

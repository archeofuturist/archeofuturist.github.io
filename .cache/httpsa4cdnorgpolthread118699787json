Prejudice defined is the &#039;an unfavorable opinion or feeling formed beforehand or without knowledge, thought, or reason.&#039; Since we cannot simply flip the switch from an unfavorable stance to a favorable one in opinion or feeling, we must take an action first that results in changing someone&#039;s opinion or feeling. For this, we look at the conditions of this definition: formed beforehand, or formed without knowledge, thought, or reason. The first avenue, &#039;beforehand&#039;, directly contrasts the second; the first condition is prior experience, while the second condition is no prior experience. Now that we have deconstructed the definition, we can determine how to correct for it: we must take an action that compels children to reduce unfavorable opinions or feelings based on prior experience, and we must take an action to compel children to reduce unfavorable opinions or feelings based on no prior experience. Everything up to this point is pure deduction of the definition of prejudice and the objective to reduce prejudice in children, nothing more, nothing less. The following actions that I will propose will follow heavily in deduction, but will not be pure, as they are proactive in nature and cannot be purely deduced from our definition or our objective.<br><br>(1\/3)","time":1490740782,"resto":118699787,"id":"IMxbSfuO","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118708255,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)18:40:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118699787\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118699787<\/a><br><br>Ultimately, I agree with the folks who are saying that you should turn in what your professor wants to see.<br><br>Note however that having to argue in favor of an idea REWIRES YOUR BRAIN and there is a danger that you will start believing the BS you wrote.

The second action, removing targets of prejudice, is dependent on what the target constitutes, but it still follows that the target be removed as to not train the child to be prejudicial. The third action, removing proponents of prejudice, can be done by segregating those influences from the children who are not prejudicial, so as to not teach them through affiliation to be prejudicial.

To reduce prejudice in children, we can introduce children to artificial environments and invoke a Pavlovian response through punishment. We can simply remove the targets of prejudice. And finally, we can segregate the prejudicial influences from children. Some examples as follows, respective to each action: select &#039;clean&#039; targets for prejudice, script the encounter without the child&#039;s knowledge, and force the child into the encounter while punishing and repeating as necessary; elect people to parliament that will remove, change, or create the appropriate laws necessary to removing the targets of prejudice; and isolating children into safe zones or communities free of targets for prejudice.

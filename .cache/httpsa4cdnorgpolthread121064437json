According to the Oregonian, \u201cA release from the Scappoose Police Department says that the warrant was the result of information they gathered proving Garza was selling marijuana over Snapchat and then posting pictures of himself with large amounts of cash on Instagram.\u201d<br><br>The clincher for young Garza: an Instagram photo of him in the backseat of a car, grinning madly and fanning out a bunch of hundreds.<br><br>Ostentatious as Garza is, the teen is outdone by a dealer who posted on Instagram under the name @NarcoOfficial. On that feed (currently not active, but covered by the Mirror), you\u2019ll find tigers, giant guns, Lamborghinis and near-naked girls \u2014 and often two or more of those elements in one photo.<br><br>However, while some of his arms are gold and shiny, none are bejeweled. That honor goes to a drug mover called Captain Anthrax.<br><br>No doubt, if they keep up the good work and don\u2019t lose their penchant for social-media boasts, these criminals will soon find themselves dealing with life behind bars.","filename":"magadrugs","ext":".jpg","w":208,"h":313,"tn_w":166,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492179304761,"time":1492179304,"md5":"3lr0Y7BEE6OAmKcaXB00qQ==","fsize":20590,"resto":0,"id":"DbFVZo33","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"drug-dealers-cant-stop-flashing-cash-online","country_name":"United States","replies":11,"images":0,"unique_ips":6},{"no":121065019,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)10:20:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"No matter the colour of their skin, they&#039;re always niggers.

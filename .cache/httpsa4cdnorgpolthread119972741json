Lmao your lack of understanding of economics is beyond retarded.

Any time you go from &quot;no faggotry&quot; to &quot;we&#039;ll tolerate faggotry&quot; you end up in the slippery slope we&#039;re in now. Rainbow flags every where and demanding all the rights which belong to a straight couple with none of the nation building (homos don&#039;t have kids, nor do they raise kids well). The damage they do to the social make up is extremely dangerous to a nation that wishes to prosper.<br><br>There are also issues with disease control which come into play. As well as issues of male bonding. A man who is seen as gay isn&#039;t getting to fuck women, so being seen as gay is genetic suicide. How many straight men are going to risk being close with other men if it means they&#039;re not going to get laid again? Now your warrior class won&#039;t bond with other warriors...

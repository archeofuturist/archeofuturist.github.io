It&#039;s a low building so to come at it at a steep angle would invite a miss. If they wanted to hit the building, going at it horizontally makes sense. I guess it would be like landing just not deploying the landing gear and not slowing down as much. Doesn&#039;t sound too hard really. <br><br>And I would expect the wings not to survive more than a few meters going down a street before being torn off by trees or whatever else they get caught up on. <br><br>It&#039;s not hard to imagine mistaking a plane without its wings for a rocket when it speeds by still a hundreds of miles per hour, or mistaking the sparks from it dragging across the ground for the exhaust from a missile. <br><br>I don&#039;t know what to believe really. It makes sense to me that our enemies would be assblasted about how much better than them we are and strike at our symbolic power structures in a cheap effective way with suicide attackers. <br><br>But it also makes sense to me that the government would attack itself to remove rogue elements or to manufacture consent for a war abroad.","time":1490987815,"resto":119078870,"id":"BwlXIqMp","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119089296,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)15:23:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119088568\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119088568<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;to manufacture consent for a war abroad<\/span><br>All the major US wars for the past century have used false flags to take the country into wars the people didn&#039;t want but their masters did.<br><br>Remember The Maine<br>Lusitania<br>Pearl Harbor <br>Gulf of Tonkin <br>(failed assassination of Reagan changed 1980 war clock to smaller wars like Grenada)<br>9\/11","time":1490988201,"resto":119078870,"id":"1kMo8W14","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119089545,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)15:25:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119088383\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119088383<\/a><br>Yea but is it some kind of new disclosed footage? and if it&#039;s being deleted does it hold some kind of importance?","time":1490988338,"resto":119078870,"id":"F4R\/lsa1","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":119089589,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)15:25:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119083252\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119083252<\/a><br>people claim to have seen a plane.","time":1490988359,"resto":119078870,"id":"kaaaS3Hu","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119089639,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)15:26:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119078870\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119078870<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;epicenter of the largest military power ever <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;not a single clear shot of the impact<\/span><br><br>(((wew)))","time":1490988389,"resto":119078870,"id":"bLLNVmsS","country":"DK","country_name":"Denmark"},{"no":119089640,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)15:26:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119083745\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119083745<\/a><br>Thank you.

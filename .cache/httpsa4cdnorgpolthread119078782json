The answer was clearly either they were too blind to update their methods to meet the changing times, or they were manipulating the numbers to push a partisan agenda. Very simple and plausible explanations for those who are not brainwashed beyond help. The ONLY poll that successfully predicted the election, USC Dornsife, also happened to be the only major poll that employed unconventional methods, which garnered them the widespread chagrin of the mainstream media until they were proven right.

Isis opinion&#039;s to kill all infidels equals Gandhi&#039;s opinion to live peacefully with everyone on right vs wrong criteria, they both come from an ideology and both rely on different moral compasses. The only thing truly impartial is the facts based on empirical evidence and observation.

Not that there is anything wrong with it, but everyone has an opinion of his own and no opinion is right or wrong compared to another. Now basing yourself on empirical observation Humans are an animal species and living organisms, and the goal of any life form is to prosper and evolve. Basing myself on observation again given the cultural differences of different societies as well as physical ones those different groups are different subspecies and the fact they have had wars means they&#039;re in competition with one another to prosper more. Now judging from the science arts and other tangible fields as well as judging on military conquest and well being, life expectancy and such, europeans are by most criteria the subspecies that prospered and evolved the most as a group, therefore they have an edge of superiority to other subspecies. European society has entered a phase of entropy and logically will lose their edge to another subspecies, so putting your group of origin before others is a perfectly natural self preservation instinct, which is not the right or wrong thing to do, it is just the natural response to this given situation and it is how a normal functioning life form of this special group reacts in such case, it is the way it is. Being opposed to this instinct is a sign of genetic dead end because of the side effect of consciousness, originally a self preservation tool.","time":1493137437,"resto":122723623,"id":"HzrGDX48","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":122751585,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)12:24:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122724130\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122724130<\/a><br>WHAT<br>ABOUT<br>ISM","time":1493137494,"resto":122723623,"id":"RI2KD17P","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122751972,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)12:28:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122724130\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122724130<\/a><br>\/thread","time":1493137708,"resto":122723623,"id":"LhZIEbrD","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122752051,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)12:29:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122749765\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122749765<\/a><br>Its very much similar to patriotism vs nationalism. <br><br>I can love my country without advocating for fucking over others just as I can love my race without being a prick to other races.

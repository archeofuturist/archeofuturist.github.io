In the kingdom of Abistan\u2014named after the prophet Abi, earthly messenger of the god Yolah\u2014citizens submit to a single god, demonstrating their devotion by kneeling in prayer nine times a day. Autonomous thought has been banned, remembering is forbidden, and an omnipresent surveillance system instantly informs the authorities of every deviant act, thought, or idea. The kingdom is blessed and its citizens are happy, filled with a sense of purpose and piety. Those who are not\u2014the heretics\u2014are put to death by stoning or beheading in city squares. But Ati has met people who think differently; in ghettos and caves, hidden from the authorities, exist the last living heretics and free-thinkers of Abistan. Under their influence, Ati begins to doubt. He begins to think. Now, he will have to defend his thoughts with his life.<br><br>&quot;[In 2084] Sansal dared to go much further than I did,&quot; said Michel Houellebecq, the controversial novelist most recently of Submission. 2084 is a cry of freedom, a call to rebellion, a gripping satirical novel of ideas, and an indictment of the religious fundamentalism that, with its hypocrisy and closed-mindedness, threatens our modern democracies and the ideals on which they are founded.","filename":"cover_9781609453664_928_240","ext":".jpg","w":240,"h":372,"tn_w":161,"tn_h":249,"tim":1490711493302,"time":1490711493,"md5":"Nfh2KdmgRi3ugqldRKOfVg==","fsize":116535,"resto":0,"id":"HNnxItYC","country":"JP","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"why-not-read-yet","country_name":"Japan","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

While I am a proponent of equality, the simple fact of the matter is that women and men are not built the same. Women sometimes need outlets to express their frustrations, and their male partners are often appropriate means to vent those feelings. Men take it because they are not just a woman&#039;s partner but a sort of &quot;stress-ball.&quot; Furthermore, this actually helps the relationship, since the woman is now calmer and happier and, by extension, the man, because his spouse is naturally the source of his happiness. When she&#039;s happy, everyone&#039;s happy.<br><br>However, a man cannot do the same. Men are heavier, bulkier, and physically stronger. When a man hits a woman he can cause serious harm, and often is done less for reasons of improving the relationship than simply being aggressive. When men get aggressive they are violent. Look at a football game, or combat exercises: when men get aggressive, they get violent.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;inb4 that&#039;s sexist<\/span><br>Just because men hit women doesn&#039;t always mean that hitting men can&#039;t be a net positive. Anyone who struggles to understand this has likely never been in a relationship before, and I encourage them to find someone not just to gain a better introspective, but to make her happy as well. ;)","time":1493317862,"resto":123064754,"id":"8EXGksNS","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123068976,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)14:40:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123067849\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123067849<\/a><br>Um, that is sexist tho you cant just go <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;inb4<\/span><br>and not say an actual agreement, a woman should be an adult and learn to not take shit out on humans, i have the feeling that your just a sexist woman","time":1493318422,"resto":123064754,"id":"GszrF+Ou","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123069529,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)14:44:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123064754\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123064754<\/a><br>WOW!

While not necessarily egalitarian by nature, this repertoire has improved numerous relationships. Also, &quot;being an adult&quot; isn&#039;t confined to following a specific set of rules that you come up with, it is characterized by a person&#039;s ability to function as a member of society and learn to deal with personal issues and find ways to be sociable, competent beings. If a man can provide an outlet for womens&#039; pent-up aggression, why shouldn&#039;t they? In addition, being &quot;adult&quot; also encompasses personal responsibility to help other, so your point is flawed in that men have just as much obligation to help their wives in any manner possible.<br><br><span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;123069102<\/span><br>I agree that both sexes should be held to the same standard, but feminism still accounts for obvious and undeniable differences between the sexes. A woman has certain needs and on average are more passionate than men, but this does not mean that women are inferior, it just means that men have responsibilities in relationships in order to accompany their partners&#039; needs.

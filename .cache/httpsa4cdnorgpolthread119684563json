It doesn&#039;t touch me at all anymore. Blacks where the first race to walk the earth besides being the largest race. They had like 20.000 years time to get forward at the place they chose to stay in. Instead they developed a ever-stalling &quot;society&quot; full of violence and retrospectives. <br><br>For me, only statistics matter. Numbers and figures. They don&#039;t lie like humans do. And if I listen to what the numbers and statistics of all the civilizations of the last tell me, then Blacks are indeed a socially failed race. The only thing that has always kept them alive was their massive reproduction. They literally reproduce faster than they can exterminate themselves or other tribes. And that being said, it&#039;s quite admirable that for Mother Nature it&#039;s enough to be a dirt eating, self destructive savage as long as you reproduce non-stop. Blacks are primitive proto-humans, later races are sophisticated beings. The only problem we&#039;ve got is though, if &quot;shit hits the fan&quot; blacks will always outlive us since they have mastered the art of creating hell on ear wherever they are AND survive in it for thousands of years.<br><br>That&#039;s something admirable by biological standards folks.","filename":"image","ext":".jpg","w":6517,"h":3961,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":75,"tim":1491443547485,"time":1491443547,"md5":"aFnKz0vXI6cuUZUQfAWBzw==","fsize":3989488,"resto":119684563,"id":"3eYVBklC","country":"DE","m_img":1,"country_name":"Germany"},{"no":119689191,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)21:59:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119688503\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119688503<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mother nature was admiral too niggers<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Blacks will outlive us <\/span><br>Game over white man, mother nature chose them.","filename":"R2_DINDU","ext":".webm","w":640,"h":360,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1491443982535,"time":1491443982,"md5":"OQnBlqM8qbA+w3PPIi4q9Q==","fsize":595563,"resto":119684563,"id":"d8RxC54n","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119690340,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)22:11:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119685562\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119685562<\/a><br>I&#039;m sure that nigger deserved it!","time":1491444703,"resto":119684563,"id":"N0RTFNyS","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119690658,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)22:14:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119688503\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119688503<\/a><br>I am tired of seeing pampered North Europeans passing judgement on the rest of the world.

Between now and than stood the &quot;Wirtschaftswunder&quot;, a &quot;good time&quot; for western Germany. Eastern Germany was in the Hard times then again but thanks to &quot;strong men&quot; they broke free and the eastern Germany (DDR) was dissolved. We are currently having, not as bad in the US.<br>Now, here comes the point, this is just a tiny frame where you may think of this civilization as cyclical, France with its kings and revolutions is a even better example. It all follows this cyclical law. You may now make the time frames bigger and count longer times and bigger landmasses, eg the EU. AFTER the world wars the European continent was devastated, then became a union and good times came back. Now Britain leaves, Greece doesn&#039;t do so well and the EU seems to have passed its peak of glory.<br><br>Sooner or later the non-black society falls apart to renew itself. Now you may just pic up a certain even and call it a proof but it&#039;s not because after good times always followed bad times and after that good times and so forth. There newer was a good times forever u silly willy. <br><br>Also black states will not &quot;recover&quot; we happen to be in Nigeria, trying to help a village build a infrastructure (yup like Good Samaritan while people complex) when my professor returned last year, they SOLD the irrigation pipes and sewer pipes, replaced the electrical well pump for a cord bucket system(the motor was sold and the bucket system broke and no more water) and they bought shit for the big families which made them have a nice 5 month and then they were filth again. Helping black states or believing you can teach them anything is a myth and pretty arrogant imo. There may be some &quot;mutants&quot; amongst them who think as a non-black does but as a whole they are primitive beyond helping WORLDWIDE. <br>And that&#039;s ok.","time":1491449101,"resto":119684563,"id":"3eYVBklC","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":119698355,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)23:28:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119697920\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119697920<\/a><br><br>Forgive my poor grammar its 5:30 am here and I got Uni in 4 hours.<br><br>Cheers I&#039;m out thread","filename":"image","ext":".jpg","w":1200,"h":865,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":90,"tim":1491449338393,"time":1491449338,"md5":"N8hlbnKYzP6G\/fmMwpToIQ==","fsize":310457,"resto":119684563,"id":"3eYVBklC","country":"DE","m_img":1,"country_name":"Germany"},{"no":119698709,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)23:32:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119698355\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119698355<\/a><br>btfo","filename":"kampala 2","ext":".jpg","w":1346,"h":543,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":50,"tim":1491449537808,"time":1491449537,"md5":"\/LMyZX\/Re+0Ub\/hrPmFn9w==","fsize":185544,"resto":119684563,"id":"C99bMD4u","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"}]}

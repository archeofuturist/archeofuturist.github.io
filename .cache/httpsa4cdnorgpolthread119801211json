However, the plot is grander, and the world he created is better defined. <br><br>To be honest, I like them both, but for very different reasons. I still reread both series about once a year. But more left-leaning people do tend to like Harry Potter, in my opinion, because it doesn&#039;t demand much of them, just acceptance (think about how many &quot;Because the Plot Demands It&quot; moments there are in the series that you just kind of have to roll with, even if it doesn&#039;t make a ton of sense for the characters to do whatever it is they are doing). <br><br>Regardless, it was Tolkien who invented a fucking genre, so he wins.","time":1491517837,"resto":119801211,"id":"1RqTyEcV","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119806697,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)18:30:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119801211\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119801211<\/a><br>I read and watched both and now I&#039;m a far-right AnCap.

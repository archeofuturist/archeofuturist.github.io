I am not talking about skynet apocolypse, I am talking about a complete redundancy of human existence, a point in time where anything and everything can be done better by machines(intelligence). A time where the question &quot;what is the point of life?&quot; can no longer be answered with &quot;explore and discover&quot;. Humans reduced to simply existing, passive receptacles for experiences, requiring only input as there is no need for their output anymore.","filename":"not like this","ext":".jpg","w":666,"h":560,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":210,"tim":1490458573419,"time":1490458573,"md5":"5sJYhhmNsEPRwO8Lk2lvGA==","fsize":95559,"resto":0,"id":"0AeOR4oC","country":"DE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"greatest-threat-to-our-society","country_name":"Germany","replies":26,"images":0,"unique_ips":8},{"no":118239922,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)12:17:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118239778\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118239778<\/a><br>Good.

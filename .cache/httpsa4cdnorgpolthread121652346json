You simply gain ownership of land and create contracts between citizens and a state. An actual social contract. The government is stopping you from doing this because the government relies on you to exist. If other governments emerge voluntarily, current governments will be outcompeted and become obsolete. If your national socialist theory of government truly is superior then it will simply thrive in spite of the inferior democratic governments of today.","filename":"hoppe","ext":".jpg","w":536,"h":400,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1492504214735,"time":1492504214,"md5":"UTK\/0saXYdCR5OIpzmVegg==","fsize":20733,"resto":121652346,"id":"Lc2CfD2R","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":121658172,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)04:30:53","name":"Praceteom","com":"<a href=\"#p121657254\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121657254<\/a><br>Your solution to government fucking with people is to have government fuck people more.<br>Fucking genius ain&#039;t ya?","time":1492504253,"resto":121652346,"id":"8cYT8Wcj","country":"US","trip":"!!nRmWeBC0+kN","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121658247,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)04:32:13","name":"Praceteom","com":"<a href=\"#p121658089\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121658089<\/a><br>Libertarianism doesn&#039;t impinge on people being anything other than self-interested.<br><br>That you think there&#039;s anything utopian about libertarian philosophy is fairly hilarious.","time":1492504333,"resto":121652346,"id":"8cYT8Wcj","country":"US","trip":"!!nRmWeBC0+kN","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121658277,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)04:32:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121652346\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121652346<\/a><br>Capitalism is the best economic system but this freedumbs is pure degeneracy.","time":1492504356,"resto":121652346,"id":"XbYXeQBv","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":121658313,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)04:33:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121657839\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121657839<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121658053\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121658053<\/a><br><br>sshh don&#039;t tell people we&#039;re not the same person","time":1492504381,"resto":121652346,"id":"sDPQVz\/Y","country":"MT","country_name":"Malta"},{"no":121658364,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)04:33:43","name":"Praceteom","com":"<a href=\"#p121657606\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121657606<\/a><br>Anarchism falls under libertarianism.<br>Libertarian is an umbrella term - it&#039;s why both John Stossel and Murray Rothbard can be rightfully considered libertarian.","time":1492504423,"resto":121652346,"id":"8cYT8Wcj","country":"US","trip":"!!nRmWeBC0+kN","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121658388,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)04:34:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121652346\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121652346<\/a><br>http:\/\/www.libertarianright.org\/","filename":"bf1ff2c2e3110cc2d168497647325611be12cbd5b84f0c6e7432532fb8119d5c","ext":".png","w":5000,"h":7500,"tn_w":83,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492504447087,"time":1492504447,"md5":"neZJcXUaypdHcahZgApFbQ==","fsize":1898032,"resto":121652346,"id":"KLSnzkdi","country":"GB","m_img":1,"country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121658449,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)04:34:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121658089\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121658089<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Humans in general are greedy, backstabbing, crooked and evil.<\/span><br><br>So let&#039;s give them the absolute power of democracy!

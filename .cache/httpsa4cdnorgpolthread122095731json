I see the same articles about 5 times on my Facebook feed, (Breitbart, Daily Wire, Louder with Crowder, etc) and DW is usually the least interesting\/informative and half the time their mobile site leaves out tweets\/quotes\/videos. I listen to Ben&#039;s podcast every day but I rarely read the articles from Daily Wire because it&#039;s mediocre at best.","time":1492749229,"resto":122095731,"id":"rw4oux\/p","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122096329,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)00:34:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122095731\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122095731<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;2017<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;doesn&#039;t use adblock<\/span>","filename":"1486087914512","ext":".gif","w":268,"h":274,"tn_w":122,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492749267752,"time":1492749267,"md5":"dhXx3pYSdEshgX5ES+k5Mw==","fsize":837827,"resto":122095731,"id":"zNX+DUeb","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122096399,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)00:35:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122096277\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122096277<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I like Ben Shapiro but the Daily Wire is quickly becoming clickbait.<\/span><br>That is also true.

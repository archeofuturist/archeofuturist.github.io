We need to create a portrait of a typical the_dildo cultist who won&#039;t accept the reality of a cucked globalist puppet.<br>1. He is constantly ridiculed on reddit for being a moron<br>2. Clings to trump because he has nothing going on in his pathetic life<br>3. Is usualy reinforced by his plebbit echochamber<br>4. Will deny any wrongdoings of trump since that would create an identity crisis<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;so the god emperor I worship is a cuck? noooooooooooo<\/span><br><br>Now we have to ask ourselves how many real \/pol\/ users who were here since the Ron Paul days would support a neocon, goldman sachs, israel-complementing flipflopping billionaire? How many of them would buy into Alex Jones&#039;s shit about pizzagate? How many of them would consider betrayal a 88D chess move?<br><br>Then you will come to the conclusion that \/pol\/ was invaded by trump shills who created the desperate &quot;shareblue&quot; narrative. First of all no one realy cares about the backwoods of the internet in which we are at the moment, especialy not D Brock and his millionaire donors. Second of all, can we admit that being critical of your candidate isn&#039;t shilling and having a consciousness is normal? You just can&#039;t applaud a guy who for the several past years warned about the Iraq war and then started bombing them and even told his press secretary to call Assad WORSE THAN HITLER.<br><br>Lastly, we must examine trump himshitself:<br>1. Didn&#039;t release his tax returns<br>2. Sucks dick of Israel<br>3. Still hires foreigners at his club<br>4. Hired a lot of crony billionaire goldman sachs execs<br>5. Backtracked on draining the swamp<br>6. When Flynn was fired neocons aplauded<br>7. Neocons aplauded the prologue to the Syria war<br><br><br>There is no argument either moral or logical for tolerating the trumpshits anymore here.","filename":"Trump-2-e1460722476350","ext":".jpg","w":877,"h":495,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":141,"tim":1492014814549,"time":1492014814,"md5":"VNGaB80SIz6ImXBw+ONxCQ==","fsize":84476,"resto":0,"id":"FcSaiUVZ","country":"PL","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"final-solution-of-the-trumpcuck-problem","country_name":"Poland","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

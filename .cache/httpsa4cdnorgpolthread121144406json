How does their health fit in?\u201c<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;FAMIGLIETTI: \u201cWell the health of course is very important, but from a quantity perspective you might imagine that there\u2019s a giant bullseye that can be seen from space that\u2019s sitting above the Great Lakes, meaning: it\u2019s a target-area in a sense for the rests of the country. Because there\u2019s so much fresh water, you can imagine that 50 years from now, well we\u2019re already talking about this, but 50 years from now there might actually be a pipeline that brings water from the Great Lakes to Phoenix. I think that\u2019s part of our future.\u201d<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;GANZER: \u201cSo the protections that we have on who can draw from the Great Lakes Watershed, you think those will go away out of necessity?\u201c<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;FAMIGLIETTI: \u201cI think the only way that would happen would be with national intervention, and we actually lack that national water policy in this country. And I think that for these reasons, that we do have water in some places\u2014the northern half of the country has a lot more water than the southern half\u2014and so as the population grows, and as climate continues to change, we probably will have to move water from where it is to where it is not, and that will require some rethinking of some of these policies and laws.\u201d<\/span>","filename":"1492151880594[1]","ext":".jpg","w":1239,"h":550,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":55,"tim":1492219433811,"time":1492219433,"md5":"sFwwc28xpbU3fTIukUyadQ==","fsize":358774,"resto":121144406,"id":"IKV2t\/x4","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":121147425,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)21:28:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121146875\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121146875<\/a><br>Fuck him.

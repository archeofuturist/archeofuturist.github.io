This helps people recognize you and makes VR feel more like hanging out in person. Just choose one of your Facebook photos and you\u2019ll see an array of options for your VR appearance.&quot;<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;You and your friends can relive personal memories from your own Timelines, or even make new ones as you explore things that interest you from people and Pages you follow.&quot;<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;We want Facebook Spaces to be a comfortable place for everyone. You have control of your experience, including the ability to pause at any time. Pausing moves you into a quiet space where you can take a break away from other people and activities. You can also choose to mute your friends or remove them from your space. Facebook Spaces is all about connecting with friends and family that you know and trust, and we\u2019re committed to making VR a positive place for all.&quot;<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;Today is only the beginning. We\u2019re launching in beta, and we\u2019ll add new features as we learn from your feedback and continue exploring what makes social VR experiences most meaningful. We also plan to bring the experience to more platforms over time. We\u2019ve only just scratched the surface of social VR technology. In the future, it will continue to transform the way people around the world stay connected with their communities and those closest to them. We can\u2019t wait to get there.&quot;<\/span><br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=dr_<wbr>04PCSDWE<br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=LYC<wbr>Nq-Dc6sM<br><br>Mother of fucking Christ, how did we let things get so bad?

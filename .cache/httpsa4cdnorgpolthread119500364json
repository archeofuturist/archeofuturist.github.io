AMA","com":"There is serious epidemic here in Somalia, 60% of the youth aged between 18-35 have migrated to Europe taking various routes. The most used route is from Somalia-Ethiopia-Sudan-Libya, then the boat ride to Italy. The crazy thing is these people will start their journey with no or little money and once they make it to Libya they happily surrender themselves to two people smuggling rings know as (Magafe) and (Maqade) who will take them as a hostage and instruct them to phone back their poor family back here in Somalia demanding at least $8,000 USD in order to ensure that their kids will have a safe crossing through the Mediterranean sea. If the family refuse to pay the money or don\u2019t pay within the deadline, they will sell their organ parts.","filename":"Somali_Immigrants","ext":".jpg","w":399,"h":258,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":161,"tim":1491331679036,"time":1491331679,"md5":"rfofp1a77VbOcjetOBRmSQ==","fsize":28745,"resto":0,"id":"w3ftXJYi","country":"SO","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"how-does-people-smuggling-to-europe-happens-ama","country_name":"Somalia","replies":12,"images":0,"unique_ips":7},{"no":119500936,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)14:53:16","name":"SomaliBro","com":"this has affected the community in very negative way, you have mothers and fathers walking the streets begging for money so they could pay the ransom money.","time":1491331996,"resto":119500364,"id":"w3ftXJYi","country":"SO","country_name":"Somalia"},{"no":119501996,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)15:02:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"Turkey-Greece by boat was \u20ac 10 000 at the start, 5 000 at the end.<br>Some Somalis was also on that route","time":1491332570,"resto":119500364,"id":"Gr4Hfiv2","country":"HR","country_name":"Croatia"},{"no":119502632,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)15:08:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"What part of Somalia you live in?","time":1491332903,"resto":119500364,"id":"NWRVSdjI","country":"HR","country_name":"Croatia"},{"no":119502653,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)15:08:31","name":"SomaliBro","com":"<a href=\"#p119501996\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119501996<\/a><br>that route no longer exists. and the prices keeps on going up. sad","time":1491332911,"resto":119500364,"id":"w3ftXJYi","country":"SO","country_name":"Somalia"},{"no":119502830,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)15:10:02","name":"SomaliBro","com":"<a href=\"#p119502632\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119502632<\/a><br>the northern part. is there any somalis in your country? im sure there are few.","time":1491333002,"resto":119500364,"id":"w3ftXJYi","country":"SO","country_name":"Somalia"},{"no":119502923,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)15:10:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119500364\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119500364<\/a><br>so they go to the border knowing that their family will be blackmailed into sending them money?<br>where the hell is their reponsibility?","time":1491333043,"resto":119500364,"id":"\/ZMXAoV2","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":119502955,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)15:11:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"Are the Somalis in Somalia less shitty than the Somalis outside of Somalia?","time":1491333063,"resto":119500364,"id":"PF8fF6tc","country":"DK","country_name":"Denmark"},{"no":119503170,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)15:12:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119502923\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119502923<\/a><br>absolutely agree with you aussiebro, they put their families through hell. its a vicious cycle.","time":1491333176,"resto":119500364,"id":"w3ftXJYi","country":"SO","country_name":"Somalia"},{"no":119503174,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)15:12:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119502830\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119502830<\/a><br>I honestly don&#039;t know, but there probably are a few, most likely in the capital.","time":1491333177,"resto":119500364,"id":"NWRVSdjI","country":"HR","country_name":"Croatia"},{"no":119503310,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)15:14:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119502955\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119502955<\/a><br>the ones here are literally scumbags compared to the ones who lived in the west.","time":1491333247,"resto":119500364,"id":"w3ftXJYi","country":"SO","country_name":"Somalia"},{"no":119503314,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)15:14:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119500364\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119500364<\/a><br>eat sand i don&#039;t give a shit","time":1491333250,"resto":119500364,"id":"sF7VSdZi","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":119503321,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)15:14:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"Isn&#039;t $8000 an impossible amount of money for someone whose life is so bad that they risk their lives to get to Europe?<br><br>Also, how would you suggest fighting this?

She&#039;s anti NATO, anti American, and her funding comes solely from Russian Banks. Also her positions on Russia (Remove sanctions and develop a trade agreement) were something she started talking about AFTER her loans from Russian banks. She is a Russian shill, and yes I agree with her immigration stances but other candidates have similar positions. She will sell out France to Russia 100%. Also she met with Putin last week.","filename":"IMG_3391","ext":".jpg","w":590,"h":350,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":148,"tim":1490629560591,"time":1490629560,"md5":"SXCWcapw+EVLjexNpTf6Hw==","fsize":72594,"resto":0,"id":"gSl5gSKd","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"marine-le-pen","country_name":"United States","replies":4,"images":1,"unique_ips":4},{"no":118525080,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)11:48:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118524833\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118524833<\/a><br>\/pol\/ is FSB\/KGB now.<br><br>Best thing to do is not to trust any shitty third or second world country that wants to invest in your country.

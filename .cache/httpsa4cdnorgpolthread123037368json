A half-service can cause much greater harm than not being sold a service in the first place. Another example: booting someone out of a plane in the middle of the trip. This is also not allowed, and yet &quot;you were on their property&quot; or &quot;if the airline says you&#039;re leaving then you&#039;re leaving&quot; says it&#039;s fine to throw someone off a plane.

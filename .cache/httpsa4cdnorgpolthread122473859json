Oh, that\u2019s right. The first round isn\u2019t even over yet. In fact, it\u2019s only projections. Does not having the lead in second round opinion polls count as a loss? Is that what you\u2019re saying? Because if you\u2019re saying that I can assure you that you\u2019re wrong. Why would you say this when the first round is still on? Le Pen is still in the race right now and she has been maintaining a strong position in the polls for how many months now? She\u2019s going against a bunch of dirty politicians and holding her ground while at such a young age. Maybe you should shut the fuck up before you make retarded assumptions like this. You know why? Because you\u2019re going to be embarrassed when Le Pen wins and someone quotes you. Oh look at that, Macron just dropped a point. Are you a fucking drunk? Are you retarded? Are you autistic? You are a fucking idiot and you should never make a post like this and I\u2019m fucking serious. I almost have a feeling you\u2019re the only guy making all these anti-Le Pen posts because you\u2019re a faggot hater who doesn\u2019t like Le Pen because she\u2019s hard working to the point of sweating heavily. Fuck you, be good at something in YOUR life and then maybe try to troll people on the internet, like I give a fuck. It\u2019s so easy to spot your posts now, you\u2019re a retard.

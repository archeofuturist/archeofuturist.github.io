They made an economy, but ethical questions came up. Ethics are very important between two nations due to the fact that they can sense intent, as well as long term goals.<br>Italy didn&#039;t care who traded with them, their format of Fascism was a Capitalist Fascism, and the only consistency was State and Selected Industry were one form, and it was used to target unfair, price hikers, however liberty, under benevolence was granted to individuals for their private profits.<br><br>This argument is not the same with Germany. They had gained a huge amount from industry, but their economy collapsed when harsher intentions started to show. A mass increase in military spending, imprisonments of populations, ethics code didn&#039;t condemn genocides, so when a nation sees that reaction, they will naturally see it as a threat and will condemn and halt trade with a nation. Due to economical influence, if one nation stops trade with one, many nations follow, especially if their own ethics follow that of the other nations.<br>Which is why Finland is nothing like Nazi Germany. Even if it adopted the entire ECONOMIC format of Nazi Germany, if the global economy doesn&#039;t see a mass increase in Military Spending, Genocidal Preaching, Imprisonment of Population, and you still allow room for International Trade, the world will simply ignore it.<br>Nazi Germany&#039;s core problem was it&#039;s advertising, as well as Isolationism.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;even North Korea is trading with other countries<\/span><br>That&#039;s not entering the global economy.

I&#039;m watching the first episode right now. I personally don&#039;t think Hitler&#039;s world would look like it does so far. The dark grimey suffering type cinematics and generally oppressed normies. Although, even this reality that&#039;s portrayed in the series so far would be a better quality of life than the shit-skin disaster we&#039;re dealing with now.","filename":"IMG_0035","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":375,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1491737847932,"time":1491737847,"md5":"3DU9x9iRk54IxeW6vd2x5A==","fsize":61438,"resto":0,"id":"DY0NTTRN","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-man-in-the-high-castle","country_name":"Canada","replies":16,"images":2,"unique_ips":12},{"no":120273698,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)07:40:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"Pretty historically inaccurate and misleading.

Gorsuch is as moderate as a Republican nominee can get as he rules on almost exactly what is in the Constitution and what is in written law. If Gorsuch is not palatable to Democrats, then literally no one would be except Merreck Garland(not happening). So Republicans are going to follow Harry Reid&#039;s precedent and use the nuclear option to stop obstructionism. The Democrats are taking a gigantic risk with this move, as Ruth Bader (((Ginsburg))) is 84, Kennedy is 80, and Breyer is turning 79. If a single one of them dies or retires after the nuclear option is used, it would shift the Supreme Court to the conservative edge for decades.","filename":"_Afrikaan_bae_0","ext":".jpg","w":576,"h":842,"tn_w":85,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491002193797,"time":1491002193,"md5":"wtQjLpIX4oXfAWzsUCwx+g==","fsize":55250,"resto":119111704,"id":"JAVBkPsV","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119113712,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)19:18:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119111704\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119111704<\/a><br>Because the two speech rule will let the dems drag this shit out until Gorsuch won&#039;t be sitting on the court for real next term.<br><br>The fucking GOP better pull their fucking heads out of their fucking asses and start playing hardball or just fucking commit suicide already.","time":1491002332,"resto":119111704,"id":"vcUkLdaA","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119113754,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)19:19:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119113476\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119113476<\/a><br>There is no way the filibuster is going to last more than a week.

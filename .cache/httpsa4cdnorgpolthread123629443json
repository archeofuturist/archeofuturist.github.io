In 1852, with the support of Horace Mann, another strong advocate of the Prussian model, Everett made the decision to adopt the Prussian system of education in Massachusetts. Unfortunately for the children and poor Irish Catholics of Massachusetts and elsewhere, the system produced a willing, cheap labor force with minimal reading and numbers skills. The Everetts of the world understood that people who could read and understand are dangerous because they are intellectually equipped to find out things for themselves, thus becoming a threat to already established power elites.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Shortly after Everett and Mann collaborated to adopt the Prussian system, the Governor of New York set up the same method in 12 different New York schools on a trial basis. Incredibly, within two weeks he declared the system a total success and took control of the entire education system in the State of New York. In a &quot;blitzkreig&quot; action with no debate, public hearing, or citizen involvement, government forced schooling was on its way in America.<\/span>","time":1493653592,"resto":123629443,"id":"2gWQWj1p","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123634851,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)11:46:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123632153\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123632153<\/a><br>I&#039;m sorry that you don&#039;t know English well enough to understand what he&#039;s saying, but Vox is purposefully misinterpreting it.","time":1493653613,"resto":123629443,"id":"lGCJLDas","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123634871,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)11:47:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123633614\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123633614<\/a><br>*Except","time":1493653624,"resto":123629443,"id":"rPvaUJrq","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123635035,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)11:48:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt; not knowing that the civil war was about 2 different economy&#039;s going to war <\/span><br>fucking libcucks make me lulz","time":1493653711,"resto":123629443,"id":"X17KmxIe","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123635061,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)11:48:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123630645\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123630645<\/a><br>Jackson almost started a civil war decades earlier against his own Vice President.<br><br>John C.

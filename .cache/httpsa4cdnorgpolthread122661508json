You people think your opinions are so important and that you possess some natural-born expertise. But take it from ME, a REAL expert, when I say your comments are even more stupider than you people making them. Now I have a lot of experience, so when I say something, it counts. That&#039;s because I&#039;m very important and I know what I&#039;m talking about, unlike feeble-minded you. I see you want to retort by posting a reply, do you? PSHAW!!! You can&#039;t post a reply to me because you&#039;re speechless, and you&#039;re too AFRAID. Besides, no one wants to hear your stupidness anyway.<br><br>Do you know who I am? I have 9 black belts, 15 Masters degrees and a PhD in Applied Arithmetic. That&#039;s right, you know I&#039;m way better than you, and all my fans and supporters will gladly tell you how great and awesome I am! Have you seen my power level? It&#039;s over 9000! You know what that means? It means I have more than 9000 units of POWER. It also puts my total adjusted force rating at 22000! That&#039;s more than triple, so you don&#039;t want to make me mad because anger is my middle name, and I give love a bad name, which only makes me angrier.<br><br>Remember: He who laughs last, laughs last.

Meaning it is falsifiable and does follow the scientific method. <br>Darwin is also not the only theory of evolution. But his theory is basically that evolution is random and the winning traits carry on and failing traits bite the dust. He made predictions based on his hypothesis and those predictions panned out and continued to pan out even after his death. He also detailed how to prove it wrong. He was a &quot;real&quot; scientist in that he wanted to be proven wrong and would be skeptical of his own work. A departure from many grant chasing &quot;scientists&quot; of today. But with all that said, it&#039;s possible that the theory could be blown out of the water someday. Perhaps aliens crash land and we find out they are us or some shit like that. There is also a theory that evolution can occur by desire. A giraffe relative starts out with a short neck. That animal wants leaves up in a tree. That desire is implanted in the DNA and generations latter, their necks are longer.

This is a gap that people like Dawkins, however intelligent they may be, don&#039;t seem to be able to fill. When they come on stage and blatter on about moral philosophy and the relative interest of a discussion on cannibalism, I think they really show that they have nothing to replace the things that they have destroyed.<br><br>As an Atheist myself, I would argue that systematic deconstruction is pointless, because the awareness that everything we do has only a relative relevance in the Universe doesn&#039;t help Humanity in any way, shape or form. <br>Relativism is only useful so far as it allows us to see things from a perspective that is different from ours. It allows us to understand our enemy and the world, and to open up dialogue where there was none possible before.<br>But it is useless to know your enemy if you have relativised the notion of enemy to the point that it doesn&#039;t matter anymore, dialogue is empty if everyone has their own truth and is allowed to live within the framework of their own delusions, and knowledge of the world is meaningless if we want to stay apathetic towards it. <br>The main weakness in modern philosophy is that there is little to no acknowledgement of the fact that, even if everything is an illusion and is meaningless, we have a system that we can work within, and we should know, learn and use the workings of this system for the betterment of our species.","time":1490425653,"resto":118192979,"country":"BE","country_name":"Belgium"},{"no":118199276,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)03:14:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118198761\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118198761<\/a><br>Furthermore, there is a tendency, especially with people like Hitchens and Dawkins, to disregard religion completely as well as an unwillingness to acknowledge that religion cannot be destroyed and has to be dealt with as something that is going to last.

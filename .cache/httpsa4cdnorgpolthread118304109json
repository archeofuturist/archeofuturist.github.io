The NCVS is a yearly survey of over 150,000 respondents of which many U.S. Government crime publications and much academic research is based.

However, other articles have been published utilizing \u201cTable 42\u201d from 2010. Gotnews.com has obtained a copy of the 2010 table that was obtained from the BJS. Either the 2010 table was previously published on the BJS website and later removed, or the table was provided directly by BJS to the article authors. If the BJS is continuing to create these tables why isn\u2019t it publishing them?<br><br>In 2012, the BJS replaced the yearly publication of the NCVS Statistical Tables with a new online analysis tool called the NVAT which does not provide access to the interracial crime data. The only option now is to retrieve this information is through manipulation of the raw survey data which requires extensive programming. The annual budget for the NCVS was over $36 million for 2014 and represents over 75 percent of the Bureau of Justice Statistics core budget.","time":1490494358,"resto":118304109,"id":"Pp\/CWw+b","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118306643,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)22:13:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"https:\/\/www.amren.com\/archives\/repo<wbr>rts\/the-color-of-crime-2016-revised<wbr>-edition\/","time":1490494432,"resto":118304109,"id":"Qzg1mtl\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118306717,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)22:14:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118305642\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118305642<\/a><br>there are like 100 mass shootings in a year and like 1% of americans are muslims<br><br>if one muslim does a mass shooting of course they&#039;re going to be massively overrepresented <br><br>this is a bad graph, and if you show this to a leftist they will tell you the exact same thing i&#039;m telling you right now, except they will follow up by calling you a racist drumpffuck","time":1490494482,"resto":118304109,"id":"49\/\/t4N1","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

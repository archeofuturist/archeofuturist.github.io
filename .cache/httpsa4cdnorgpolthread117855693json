Atheism is in decline worldwide, with the number of atheists falling from 4.5% of the world&#039;s population in 1970 to 2.0% in 2010 and projected to drop to 1.8% by 2020, <br><br>Real surveys and statistics say atheism is on the decline worldwide. Sorry atheists but atheism is not on the rise nor is it winning. It&#039;s still the minority and a declining one at that. <br><br>The Pew Research Center&#039;s statistics show that atheism is expected to continue to decline all the way into 2050 with a continued growth of religion. Other research also shows a huge surge in growth for Christianity in China which is currently the world&#039;s most &quot;atheist&quot; nation because of the atheist communist government suppressing religion, the research suggests that China will soon become the world&#039;s most Christian nation within 15 years. <br><br>This is simply history repeating itself: Christianity prospered in Rome back in the ancient era when it was suppressed and it still grew in the militant atheist soviet Russia when it was suppressed there only a century ago with the majority of Russians today now also identifying as Christian. Just goes to show that atheist suppression of religion still doesn&#039;t stop religion.<br><br>Sources for the legion of whiny \/Redditor\/ fedoras that will no doubt show up it this thread:<br><br>http:\/\/www.pewforum.org\/2015\/04\/02\/<wbr>religious-projections-2010-2050\/<br>http:\/\/www.pewforum.org\/2012\/12\/18\/<wbr>global-religious-landscape-unaffili<wbr>ated\/<br>http:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/news\/wor<wbr>ldnews\/asia\/china\/10776023\/China-on<wbr>-course-to-become-worlds-most-Chris<wbr>tian-nation-within-15-years.html<br>http:\/\/masterrussian.com\/russia\/fac<wbr>ts.htm","filename":"1490142549767","ext":".jpg","w":608,"h":755,"tn_w":201,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490228626532,"time":1490228626,"md5":"gbLQR\/M\/TdWWLU+dYjIA+Q==","fsize":123410,"resto":0,"id":"ADibSAWy","country":"PL","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"atheism-is-the-fastest-shrinking-religion-in-the","country_name":"Poland","replies":5,"images":3,"unique_ips":6},{"no":117856948,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)20:32:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117855693\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117855693<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;when you&#039;re so insecure about your Christian faith you have to make this thread 12 times a day<\/span><br>wew","filename":"wew","ext":".gif","w":182,"h":260,"tn_w":87,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490229147164,"time":1490229147,"md5":"kuulkCSGV47q5vXTKF\/ldg==","fsize":1474939,"resto":117855693,"id":"E72VWnwr","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117857420,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)20:35:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117855693\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117855693<\/a><br>Few people refuse to acknowledge any form of spiritual life and we call those Finns.

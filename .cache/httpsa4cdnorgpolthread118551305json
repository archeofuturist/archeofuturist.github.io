Oh, that&#039;s right. His term isn&#039;t even over yet. In fact, it&#039;s only been 2 months. Does not having a high approval rating count as a loss? Is that what you&#039;re saying? Because if you&#039;re saying that I can assure you that you&#039;re wrong. Why would you make this topic when he is still president? Trump is playing 4-D chess right now and has been for how many years now? He&#039;s fixing one of the worst healthcare systems who just happen to have a lead because they&#039;re feeding off the energy the Obama administration. But you know what? They still fucking suck. Republicans are one of the best fucking parties, they went and won the election in November. Maybe you should shut the fuck up before you make retarded topics like this. You know why? Because you&#039;re going to be embarrassed when Trump wins and someone bumps this topic. Oh look at that, a judge just blocked Trumps travel ban, just like the other judge did. Are you a fucking drunk? Are you retarded? Are you autistic? You are a fucking idiot and you should never make a topic on this board again and I&#039;m fucking serious. I almost have a feeling you&#039;re the only guy making all these anti-Trump topics because you&#039;re a faggot hater who doesn&#039;t like the president because he&#039;s good. Fuck you, be good at something in YOUR life and then maybe try to troll these fucking presidents on the board, like I give a fuck. It&#039;s so easy to spot out your threads now, you&#039;re a retard. Always doing stupid shit like this. Why don&#039;t you try to be a good poster? Just for once? For once in your fucking life try not to make a topic like this. That&#039;s just you, you&#039;re always right at getting it wrong. Fuck you. You are nothing.","filename":"doyouknowwhereyouare","ext":".jpg","w":666,"h":568,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":106,"tim":1490644639090,"time":1490644639,"md5":"Jtymc6pR07k7TG4h+X8N3A==","fsize":86423,"resto":118551305,"id":"Wg9bn+8W","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118553477,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)15:58:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118551305\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118551305<\/a><br>Conway is ugly but everytime I see her on her knees I get hard.","time":1490644697,"resto":118551305,"id":"5E7pJHuM","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

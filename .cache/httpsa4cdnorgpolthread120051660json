He was brown of some sort, so based Mom told him to go back to his own shitty country and told him he was the reason people are prejudiced. <br><br>My mom is in her 60s and I highly doubt this shitskin would pull this someone more dangerous like a man. My mom finally got through the other door (it&#039;s a small, low car, really hard for an older woman to crawl through), called him a piece of shit muslim as she drove away. She got pictures and I&#039;m going to look up the tow company when she sends them to me.<br><br>Any recommendations on what I should do? I&#039;m not going to go attack the guy, nothing super illegal like that, but any other way to harm this shitskin fuck? We could phone and complain to is boss (she has pictures of him jamming her in) or put the pic up in a bad review online, though he might actually own the company as it&#039;s a small company I&#039;ve never heard of before. I could continually call them to locations where nobody will ever be, wasting their time\/money? Key his tow truck\/slash his tires?","filename":"towdeeznuts","ext":".jpg","w":455,"h":500,"tn_w":227,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491610220733,"time":1491610220,"md5":"yftVELVhNRZwZhml1F9fCQ==","fsize":25378,"resto":0,"id":"tayxX1Me","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"so-my-mom-just-told-me-how-she-was-parked-nearon","country_name":"Canada","replies":2,"images":2,"unique_ips":3},{"no":120051934,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)20:12:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120051660\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120051660<\/a><br>Every day, sneak one slice of uncooked bacon somewhere on the business property","filename":"kekuna","ext":".png","w":586,"h":550,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":117,"tim":1491610347065,"time":1491610347,"md5":"dn\/M4hzFva85\/uKFvpNxrA==","fsize":20862,"resto":120051660,"id":"ZdhA1wDC","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120052185,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)20:14:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"whats the name of the company? if it has a google places page then there is plenty of fun to be had with reviews","filename":"hqdefault","ext":".jpg","w":480,"h":360,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1491610466576,"time":1491610466,"md5":"QIbOkB\/KGkNGuD1ib3pkjw==","fsize":22706,"resto":120051660,"id":"Zg16b45u","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

In accordance with my conversation with you yesterday, I took to the meeting with (a US official (illegible)) this morning your memorandum dated 10 April and bearing the above-entitled subject heading. I offered this memorandum to him and had actually (so you will observe from the foot of the original , which is returned to you herewith) torn off your name -- and was about to tear off my title at the top, when (official) stated that he did not believe he wished to have any more from us at this time, on this subject. He expressed a profound distaste for the entire matter and said that he hoped we would never hear of it again -- it had been a hasty and difficult issue, principally because of the difficulty of explaining away the film and the statements of the American fliers. However, the vote had been favorable and he hoped that this was the end of the matter for him. He had no desire to raise the subject again himself, but said that he would probably call upon us for additional material if and when the matter should arise in the future.<br><br>My bump, is this of any use?

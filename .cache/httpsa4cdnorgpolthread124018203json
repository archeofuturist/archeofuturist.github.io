In accordance with my conversation with you yesterday, I took to the meeting with (a US official (illegible)) this morning your memorandum dated 10 April and bearing the above-entitled subject heading. I offered this memorandum to him and had actually (so you will observe from the foot of the original , which is returned to you herewith) torn off your name -- and was about to tear off my title at the top, when (official) stated that he did not believe he wished to have any more from us at this time, on this subject. He expressed a profound distaste for the entire matter and said that he hoped we would never hear of it again -- it had been a hasty and difficult issue, principally because of the difficulty of explaining away the film and the statements of the American fliers. However, the vote had been favorable and he hoped that this was the end of the matter for him. He had no desire to raise the subject again himself, but said that he would probably call upon us for additional material if and when the matter should arise in the future.<br><br>My bump, is this of any use?

I said that we fully shared his view that &quot;the issue was finished in the United Nations&quot;, but that it had been our experience that &quot;the bug&quot; comes from a very hardy strain and had exhibited appalling vitality. For this reason, I said that I thought it would be a mistake to be too complacent about the matter. To the last statement (The US official) replied with a question as to just what explanation we could give of the statements of the American fliers -- how did we account for this and what could be done about it? I said that our best guess was that the statements had been in one way or another forced out of the captive airmen and that one of the techniques which we thought had possibly been used was the Soviet (and now Chinese) techniques of &quot;brain-washing&quot;. (The US official) said that he thought the public was very inadequately informed about &quot;brain-washing&quot; and that in the absence of a much larger quantity of public information than now exists on this subject, the impact of the fliers&#039; statements is terrific. I replied by stating that we shared his view and pointed out that the Department of Defense is expected to issue a lengthy statement over the week-end and that he might watch his Sunday of Monday newspaper for this.","time":1493875636,"resto":124018203,"id":"U+Ax2QB3","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":124024550,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)01:28:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124023464\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124023464<\/a><br>Fuck the CIA.

From February to March 1952, more bulletins reported disease outbreaks in the area of Chorwon, Pyongyang, Kimhwa and even Manchuria.[3] The Chinese soon became concerned when 13 Korean and 16 Chinese soldiers contracted cholera and the plague, while another 44 recently deceased were tested positive for meningitis.[4] Although the Chinese and the North Koreans did not know exactly how the soldiers contracted the diseases, the suspicions soon shifted to the Americans.[4]<br><br>On 22 February 1952, the North Korean Foreign Ministry made a formal allegation that American planes had been dropping infected insects onto North Korea. This was immediately denied by the US government. The accusation was supported by eye-witness accounts by the Australian reporter Wilfred Burchett and others.[5][6]<br><br>In June 1952 the United States proposed to the United Nations Security Council that the Council request the International Red Cross investigate the allegations. The Soviet Union vetoed the American resolution, and, along with its allies, continued to insist on the veracity of the biological warfare accusations.","time":1493876482,"resto":124018203,"id":"351rbWaO","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124025850,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)01:41:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124025809\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124025809<\/a><br>In February 1953, China and North Korea produced two captured U.S. Marine Corps pilots to support the allegations.

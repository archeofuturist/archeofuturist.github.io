No matter what happens, it&#039;s always the fault of the jews. Yes, jewish influence is a big reason things are so shit, but even when you have a president who&#039;s deporting more people than before, who&#039;s got border crossings down and is working against (((globalist))) trade deals, you&#039;re ready to call traitor because he isn&#039;t fucking over Israel, which no one who&#039;d spend a minute listening to a rally of his would think he would, given how much kosher dick he sucked at the time. People like you don&#039;t give a fuck about the West. If everyone here got mongrelized and died, you would be fine with this, provided that Israel got the shaft as well.

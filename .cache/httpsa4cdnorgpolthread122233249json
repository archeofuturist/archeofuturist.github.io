He realized he needed to know the size of Earth. Obviously, one couldn\u2019t walk all the way around to figure it out.<br><br>Eratosthenes had heard from travelers about a well in Syene (now Aswan, Egypt) with an interesting property: at noon on the summer solstice, which occurs about June 21 every year, the sun illuminated the entire bottom of this well, without casting any shadows, indicating that the sun was directly overhead. Eratosthenes then measured the angle of a shadow cast by a stick at noon on the summer solstice in Alexandria, and found it made an angle of about 7.2 degrees, or about 1\/50 of a complete circle.<br><br>He realized that if he knew the distance from Alexandria to Syene, he could easily calculate the circumference of Earth. But in those days it was extremely difficult to determine distance with any accuracy. Some distances between cities were measured by the time it took a camel caravan to travel from one city to the other. But camels have a tendency to wander and to walk at varying speeds. So Eratosthenes hired bematists, professional surveyors trained to walk with equal length steps. They found that Syene lies about 5000 stadia from Alexandria.<br><br>Eratosthenes then used this to calculate the circumference of the Earth to be about 250,000 stadia. Modern scholars disagree about the length of the stadium used by Eratosthenes. Values between 500 and about 600 feet have been suggested, putting Eratosthenes\u2019 calculated circumference between about 24,000 miles and about 29,000 miles. The Earth is now known to measure about 24,900 miles around the equator, slightly less around the poles.","filename":"1490200184158","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":960,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1492836168863,"time":1492836168,"md5":"DjkVPAZ2Apwa1WFMu3Nd2g==","fsize":179051,"resto":122233249,"id":"wm+gT5LO","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":122236898,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)00:43:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122236641\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122236641<\/a><br>if this flat earth shit is a meme its a pathetic and unfunny one","time":1492836191,"resto":122233249,"id":"YESSQvhn","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122236917,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)00:43:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122236482\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122236482<\/a><br>The north would get more sun than the south<br>Meaning more penguins in south america and less snowmen in canada","time":1492836202,"resto":122233249,"id":"428982FE","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122237012,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)00:44:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122236917\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122236917<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The north would get more sun than the south<\/span><br>Why??

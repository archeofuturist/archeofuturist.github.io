How any old shmuck can get into college and get a degree nowadays. College used to be for the elite. But now degrees are worthless because everyone and their mother has one. And on top of that, they make you take out massive loans to get your ass in debt for years and years. And the schools, and the parents (the parents are the guiltiest ones here) drive into kids&#039; heads that you have to go to college to make something of yourself or get a good job. Why don&#039;t these schools or parents ever suggest trade schools or anything? Why do they keep shilling this whole college scam bullshit? How does this tie into (((their))) plans?","filename":"1459391587109","ext":".jpg","w":742,"h":960,"tn_w":193,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492410370539,"time":1492410370,"md5":"O2ayoqNrcv7Mj0E\/LX4+0Q==","fsize":270052,"resto":0,"id":"EVnVL4L6","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-college-agenda","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

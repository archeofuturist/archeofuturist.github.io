Then we pray to the magic sky man thanking him for the delicious bounty that our obese wives just boiled straight from the box.<br>Even the &quot;rich&quot; people here are poor.<br>There is no community, we are all just interchangable labor units. We&#039;re the powerhouse of the world, doing what no one else in the world wants to do. We all join the military to make sure Europe doesn&#039;t need one. We do manual labor. We pay all our taxes to keep the rest of the world running like peasants would give most of their crops to the landowner. <br>We&#039;re all born into poverty with not much opprotunity. <br>There is no American culture. We&#039;re just robotic parts, keeping things running for the actual first world. That&#039;s why life is seen as so cheap here. <br>There is nothing here but sadness. We have no beautiful sites, no nice neighbourhoods.<br>This country is hopeless and all whites need to escape.<br><br>Europe could not survive as it is without an underclass, and you gave that job to your diaspora. Fuck our govenment for choosing to rule in hell over serving in heaven.","filename":"image","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":789,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":192,"tim":1491154876402,"time":1491154876,"md5":"WrZbUmwzVjWjeJVm3D\/5bw==","fsize":186049,"resto":0,"id":"6b3kHBkx","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"euros-should-thank-us","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

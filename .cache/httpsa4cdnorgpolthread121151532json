You&#039;re saying purely the pure act of bowing to others is sinful and not the intent behind it, which ignores that sin begins in the heart and people will have different things in their heart depending on the intent of the bowing thus the act is not the sin but the intent behind it. The intent behind the teaching of bowing here would be worship. There is no worship of saints, however, simply asking for prayers and honoring them.","filename":"1563545434","ext":".png","w":300,"h":518,"tn_w":72,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492226052050,"time":1492226052,"md5":"MNq8OZfQeMD+cfiQqvkqiQ==","fsize":179861,"resto":121151532,"id":"ODo2vm6x","country":"US","trip":"!!tuOwy1ct2dy","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121160788,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)23:15:17","name":"WOLFSHIEM","com":"<a href=\"#p121160670\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121160670<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;They can&#039;t hear you<\/span><br>There is also a mention of saints gathering prayers in the Book of Revelation and the reference to our actions still maintaining a &quot;cloud of witnesses&quot;, saying that those who perish still watch over us.

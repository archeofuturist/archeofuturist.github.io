Bad things to hide behind are cars and trees that will flip and splinter. Cover your head and neck. Get indoors as soon as possible and once inside, strip all of your clothing off and put it in a different room or a plastic bag if possible. Taking your clothes off could be the matter of life and death because of all the radioactive particles stuck to it. If you get burned, wash the burns right away and do not bandage them more than is necessary. Take iodine tablets if you can find them as it will prevent thyroid cancer.","filename":"1491609306749","ext":".jpg","w":400,"h":400,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491746354524,"time":1491746354,"md5":"tHFewHrLd+pXiE0qd652Lg==","fsize":36812,"resto":120276270,"id":"7a7OfRZx","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120285009,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)10:00:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120277612\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120277612<\/a><br><a href=\"#p120284389\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120284389<\/a><br>so it just delays death, seems like it wouldnt prove that useful in a all out war scenario","filename":"1484067902321","ext":".jpg","w":498,"h":750,"tn_w":83,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491746459191,"time":1491746459,"md5":"LFzcXCUWGRNkcZpqwqKnnw==","fsize":98742,"resto":120276270,"id":"aGVfEjLe","country":"TR","country_name":"Turkey"},{"no":120285093,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)10:01:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120276270\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120276270<\/a><br>Not near any probable ground zero so if I don&#039;t die in slow agony from radiation poisoning I&#039;ll die from starvation or armed looters.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;too nice to be a post apocalyptic motor raider.<\/span><br>The superior isolation skills from years as a NEET would come in handy if I had access to a fallout shelter though.","filename":"6548822355","ext":".gif","w":320,"h":238,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":92,"tim":1491746507581,"time":1491746507,"md5":"L6oTzOrarrL5lUS66pH0YA==","fsize":2267594,"resto":120276270,"id":"TuP8dq+0","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":120285193,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)10:02:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"New Warlord of Far North - Queensland","time":1491746573,"resto":120276270,"id":"BpJVUQrg","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":120285401,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)10:05:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120279137\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120279137<\/a><br>But who would waste a bomb on Brisbane?

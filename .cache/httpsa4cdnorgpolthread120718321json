A confession letter was found near the scene, but police have been refusing to give any more details so far. The injured player, Marc Bartra, is in a hospital (nothing life-threatening, &quot;just&quot; a broken bone in one of his hands and they had to remove some shrapnel pieces\/splinters from his body). A policeman who was escorting the bus on a motorbike is in hospital too, being treated for PTSD - kek. The game got postponed to today.<br><br>http:\/\/www.focus.de\/sport\/fussball\/<wbr>bombenanschlag-in-dortmund-explosio<wbr>nen-am-bvb-bus-polizei-geht-von-ern<wbr>stzunehmenden-sprengsaetzen-aus_id_<wbr>6942002.html<br>http:\/\/www.sport1.de\/fussball\/champ<wbr>ions-league\/2017\/04\/nach-abfahrt-vo<wbr>n-bvb-mannschaftsbus-explosion-in-d<wbr>ortmund<br>http:\/\/www.mirror.co.uk\/sport\/footb<wbr>all\/borussia-dortmund-bus-bombing-e<wbr>verything-10208609","filename":"since-last-muslim-minute-errorist-attack","ext":".png","w":500,"h":707,"tn_w":176,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491974197985,"time":1491974197,"md5":"8b\/AOuqtmcvrnNdjtO5TuQ==","fsize":145668,"resto":0,"id":"TqcBPGSo","country":"DE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"dortmund-bombing-last-evening","country_name":"Germany","replies":3,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":120718635,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)01:20:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"if you still push Poland, Hungary and the rest of V4 to take refugees I will come to germany and set some trash cans on fire<br>maybe even beat some darkskins","time":1491974428,"resto":120718321,"id":"2sAfkufW","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":120718847,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)01:23:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120718635\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120718635<\/a><br>As long as you don&#039;t steal any cars I&#039;m fine with that.","time":1491974583,"resto":120718321,"id":"TqcBPGSo","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":120719001,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)01:24:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120718847\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120718847<\/a><br>enjoy your caliphate then","time":1491974688,"resto":120718321,"id":"2sAfkufW","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"}]}

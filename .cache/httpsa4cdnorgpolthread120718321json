A confession letter was found near the scene, but police have been refusing to give any more details so far. The injured player, Marc Bartra, is in a hospital (nothing life-threatening, &quot;just&quot; a broken bone in one of his hands and they had to remove some shrapnel pieces\/splinters from his body). A policeman who was escorting the bus on a motorbike is in hospital too, being treated for PTSD - kek.

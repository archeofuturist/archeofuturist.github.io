It is a construct made up by Jewish-dominated past-Enlightenment academia that has almost fucking nothing in common with what even ancient Greeks, never mind practicers of paganisms from which very little survived to our day, like that of the Norse, actually believed. It was made up to seem anything more than a collection of bloody and incosistent superstitions specifically to undermine Christianity.<br><br>Take a look at the most advanced paganism in history, Hinduism. A small bunch of Christian adventurers BTFOed a whole sub-continent its adherents and their descendants only failed to kept India under their thumb due to events that flowed from the Europe abandoning Christianity. Hinduism also was not very successful at teaching people to poo in loo of course.<br><br><a href=\"#p120095862\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120095862<\/a><br><br>Hi \/Reddit.","time":1491631635,"resto":120093820,"id":"pdU9NiBi","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120098022,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)02:21:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120095679\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120095679<\/a><br><a href=\"#p120095764\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120095764<\/a><br>You guys try to tie race and religion together way too much.","filename":"dance","ext":".gif","w":540,"h":324,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":75,"tim":1491632466674,"time":1491632466,"md5":"+4fbNgZsD4ti5LuP4x2Jkg==","fsize":984723,"resto":120093820,"id":"52gSIyhv","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120098188,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)02:22:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120095679\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120095679<\/a><br><br>Saying Christianity is jewdized are retarded. Under pagan Rome, Jews enjoyed full citizen rights, as in most of the pagan world, including Greece, Syria, etc. However, once Christianity became a political power, around the 4-5th centuries, Rome made it illegal for Christian citizens to practice Jewish customs, and even turned many pagan practices into Christian traditions.<br><br>By the turn of the 11th century, most European nations were already Christian and totally different from rabbinic or Talmudic Judaism. In fact, no christian nation has ever historically adapted anything from Judaism. (Which is why I use the term Christian values, not Judeo-Christian, as that never existed). There was no commonality in the practice of these two religions. Even the interpretation of biblical laws were different. In fact, even Jesus himself condemned the Jews of his day and all their unbiblical or extrabiblical laws. Jesus was one of the biggest opponents of &quot;Jews&quot;, which is why they passionately hated him.<br><br>By the 16th century, many European countries already had a history of expelling Jews or making them pay extra fines\/taxes to live there. Most Jews didn&#039;t enjoy full citizenship rights either.<br><br>The only reason why &quot;Jews&quot; have been able to get such power, wealth, etc, in these recent past centuries is because they hate Christians. Their whole purpose of gaining global power and influence is to destroy Christianity and Christendom (the Western world), or White people, who are the ones who spread Christianity to other peoples.<br><br>Jews were able to live with pagans because they mutually did not pose a threat to each other. They stayed separate for the most part, e.g. kept to themselves (in designated communities, e.g. Greece, Syria, etc). When Christianity came to the forefront, the world was turned upside down, and Christianity gained the most influence in every aspect of life. This turned certain &quot;Jews&quot; in power to become anti-christ, just as when Jesus himself came.","time":1491632565,"resto":120093820,"id":"0yxViKXN","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"}]}

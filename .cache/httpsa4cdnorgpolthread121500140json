To me it seems like each side of the political spectrum is becoming a parody of itself.<br><br>100-200 years ago, American political parties weren&#039;t identical, but they were VERY similar in comparison to today. Now it&#039;s very obvious that the Democrats are strictly left-wing, and Republicans are almost strictly right-wing. And the parties are just the tip of the iceberg. It&#039;s the constituents that are becoming insanely polarized. What used to be fringe for each side is yelling louder and louder to have their voices heard, communists\/anarchists on the left, and fascists\/libertarians on the right. <br><br>I know those sides might seem weird, but I feel like those are the sides that can get along well enough and agree on a surprising amount of things. The ideologies are starkly different for both sides, but ideology is all but abandoned at this point in favor of individuals with their own ideas simply saying that they&#039;re X when in reality they only believe in about 10% of the ideals of X.<br><br>The internet is the most important invention in the past 100 or more years.

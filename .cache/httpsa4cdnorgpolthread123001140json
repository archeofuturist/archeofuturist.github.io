Claimed he would label China currency manipulators, yea that didn&#039;t happen. 4. Claim he would stay out of Syria. Not only did he bomb Syria but he warned the Russians and Syrians before hand. 5. Claimed He would pull out the U.N. not only did he not he said it&#039;s no longer obsolete. 6. Claimed he would have a brand new Health-care bill before the 100 days. 7. Claimed he wouldn&#039;t have any conflicts of interest. 8. Claimed the travel band would work notice he&#039;s had 2 and both been struck down. I could keep going but notice his supporters don&#039;t care nor do they live in reality. I understand supportorting your team but not when it&#039;s this bad. Hell Trump could say they are stupid for voting him and they still would support him.","filename":"pepe the frog","ext":".png","w":700,"h":673,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":240,"tim":1493271570821,"time":1493271570,"md5":"M3zApEA\/DNzceaVp+3erZQ==","fsize":110112,"resto":0,"id":"hnoY381F","country":"IT","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"trump-is-doing-stuff-he-said-he-wouldnt-and-his","country_name":"Italy","replies":4,"images":2,"unique_ips":5},{"no":123001212,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)01:40:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"WHO \/REGRET\/ HERE","filename":"1487020484682","ext":".png","w":291,"h":344,"tn_w":105,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493271615894,"time":1493271615,"md5":"dVGu1PwoHinAViWRysOvdA==","fsize":87218,"resto":123001140,"id":"iwkkPxYr","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123001347,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)01:41:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;implying his votes were for him<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;implying they weren&#039;t votes against hillary<\/span><br>t. moderate democrat who voted trump","filename":"1477498222084","ext":".jpg","w":604,"h":522,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":108,"tim":1493271707421,"time":1493271707,"md5":"Yh3bwFwguRaNsHlxzwRH8Q==","fsize":129430,"resto":123001140,"id":"C0tY6KiR","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123001392,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)01:42:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"No one who voted Trump regrets it.

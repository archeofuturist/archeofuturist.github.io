The legislative is going to be a slaughter with both Socialists and Les R\u00e9publicains torn apart between selling themselves to Macron or not.<br>His voters were already for a big part resigned voters in the 1st turn (and it will be even worse in the 2nd).<br>So what is he going to do if he can&#039;t have the support of his voting base and of a majority in parliament? Well he&#039;ll just do what they all agree on: more immigration, more sucking up to Merkel\/Schulz, more degeneracy.<br><br>A Macron&#039;s mandate is just wasting 5 years because if Macron wins this time, Le Pen will next time.","time":1493461494,"resto":123305921,"id":"fueDPY4a","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":123320316,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)06:26:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123305921\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123305921<\/a><br>and how exactly a colonial muslim nigger shithole is going to elect someone like Le pen ?","time":1493461568,"resto":123305921,"id":"u21xIsgM","country":"GR","country_name":"Greece"},{"no":123320467,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)06:28:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123316255\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123316255<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;desu<\/span><br><br>is this the antifa thing where they are trying to integrate? nice reddit spacing cuckboy","time":1493461713,"resto":123305921,"id":"K5jERRXt","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"}]}

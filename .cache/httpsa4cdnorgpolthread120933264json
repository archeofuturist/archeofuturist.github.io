In other words, the messages could be anything. Usually, the more frequent they are means there could be something important going on. One way messages are sent for secrecy and efficiency. Sometimes, field ops don&#039;t have a secure enough way to report back, so bases send their messages to them via encrypted one way radio broadcast messages. Usually they are at predetermined times for them to check for information that they may need. For base to base one way communication, they usually have around the clock comms monitors that record the messages and pass them to whom they need to go to. Messages can be relayed by phone over the radio, or by direct radio broadcasts.

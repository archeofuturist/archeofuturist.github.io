IQ: 70. World ranking: #36.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Despite Botswana\u2019s continued economic growth, the country faces high levels of poverty and inequality, as well as low human development indicators. While poverty rates declined from 50% at independence to just over 19% today, significant pockets of poverty remain, especially in rural areas. Education expenditure is among the highest in the world, at around 9% of GDP, and includes the provision of nearly universal and free primary education, however, the sector has not created the skilled workforce Botswana needs to diversify its economy. Unemployment has remained persistent at nearly 17.8%, and as a consequence, income inequality in Botswana is among one of the highest in the world. The HIV\/AIDS pandemic has further exacerbated the situation; the HIV\/AIDS adult prevalence rate remains at 22%, contributing to education and health outcomes that are below those of countries in the same income group.<\/span><br>https:\/\/www.worldbank.org\/en\/countr<wbr>y\/botswana\/overview<br><br>its a nigger country just because they not eating mudcookies does&#039;nt make them first world","filename":"1490632886882","ext":".gif","w":240,"h":320,"tn_w":93,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491671667051,"time":1491671667,"md5":"cSp7kw0Rfqfi3I\/PEBXZ5g==","fsize":308154,"resto":120154180,"id":"2oBfXcGV","country":"DO","country_name":"Dominican Republic"},{"no":120154998,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)13:14:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120154180\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120154180<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Botswana<\/span><br>what a fucking joke","filename":"Screenshot_236","ext":".png","w":291,"h":96,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":41,"tim":1491671670338,"time":1491671670,"md5":"AtzPTRHRqwUF1SOhbYx1zQ==","fsize":5068,"resto":120154180,"id":"Cmcer+n4","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120155040,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)13:14:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120154180\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120154180<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;China<\/span><br><br>LMAO China is ready to cave in on itself.

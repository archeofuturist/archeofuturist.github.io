And i totally get it in fact i think i understand the consistences more than any of you fucks do because I&#039;ve been living with it !<br>there was are school&#039;s that are entirely comprised of brown people in my city and we call them &quot;Brown towns&quot; because they are nearly all immigrants and they are fucking nasty they hate white people and are there own type of extremists. They even choked out one of my friends during class and received no consequences for there actions and even pulled a gun on the homie. The only sanctuary is downtown or certain suburbs around. I know understand what its like more than most to put up with this shit, there gang&#039;s and racism because i&#039;ve been living with it so don&#039;t leafs deserve a little respect? Also general Canadian discussion i would really love to know more about what you think about our country and maple syrup reserves","filename":"0c2aa805285af6c9958c2c3f2ae7e65e","ext":".png","w":635,"h":143,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":56,"tim":1490702487409,"time":1490702487,"md5":"DCqoBSha9smVjCw\/KufmXg==","fsize":45305,"resto":0,"id":"qOS8AXZM","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"okay-pol-i-am-pissed-off-why-do-you-seem-to","country_name":"Canada","replies":1,"images":1,"unique_ips":1},{"no":118642676,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)08:12:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"I need answer&#039;s i know the country&#039;s fucked but i put up with this shit","filename":"canadian-immigration","ext":".jpg","w":3000,"h":2250,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1490703173558,"time":1490703173,"md5":"cMx\/Yf8e8qPEjbm1bpbMpQ==","fsize":4172593,"resto":118641843,"id":"qOS8AXZM","country":"CA","m_img":1,"country_name":"Canada"}]}

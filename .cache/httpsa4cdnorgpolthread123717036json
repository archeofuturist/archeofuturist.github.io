Period.","com":"I am disgusted by the fact that all these liberals from the_donald have been spreading their shit ideology views on marijuana and that it is &quot;harmful&quot;. It is not and you need to KYS if you think it does.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;b-but Alcohol and Tobacco are more harmful that Marijuana<\/span><br><br>Except the difference here is that Alcohol and Tobacco are legal and are widely distributed than Marijuana. More so, there NO serious scientific\/medical evidence that Marijuana is indeed good or harmless. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Medical Marijuana. Bam. Owned. QED MUDDAFUGGA<\/span><br><br>Except here is that Marijuana is not regulated by the FDA and the dosage of Marijuana varies. No drug that is approved by the FDA is smoked. Arizona&#039;s distribution of medical Marijuana indicates that only 3.76 percent of card holders use Marijuana to ease the symptoms of cancer. Another 1.53 percent suffer from glaucoma while a 1.06 percent have AIDS while in states like Colorado and and California, over 90 percent use it for &quot;severe pain&quot;. These individuals are 18-30 years old.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;But you can eat it!!<\/span><br><br>Same argument as above. Marijuana isn&#039;t regulated when it comes to dosage and now dispensaries compete for who has the highest THC level in their weed. How is that going to treat each individual symptoms that Marijuana advocates claim that MJ heals? Hint: It doesnt.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Yeah OK but it&#039;s NOT ADDICTING!!!<\/span><br><br>False. The 2012 National survey on Drug Use and Health estimates that 2.7 million people 12 years of age and older meet the DSM-IV criteria for dependence on Marijuana. More so, an adolescent brain is much more suspectable to addiction than an adult. This has received support from studies where animals have shown that parental exposure to THC can recalibrate the sensitivity of the reward system to other drugs. That same exposure affects interferes with cytoskeletal dynamics which are critical for the establishment of axonal connections between neurons.","filename":"SayNoToWeed","ext":".jpg","w":484,"h":502,"tn_w":241,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493694317866,"time":1493694317,"md5":"AIhG4rnqwAz5w9CRL2puww==","fsize":60291,"resto":0,"id":"ypSMYy9H","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"you-are-a-degenerate-if-you-smoke-marijuana","country_name":"United States","replies":16,"images":2,"unique_ips":11},{"no":123717177,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)23:06:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123717036\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123717036<\/a><br><br>That it is *harmless<br><br>Jesus Christ.","time":1493694399,"resto":123717036,"id":"ypSMYy9H","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123717189,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)23:06:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123717036\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123717036<\/a><br>What does something I do bother you so much?

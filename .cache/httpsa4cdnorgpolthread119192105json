Most right wingers are either religious or are pro-religion when it benefits their society. Most left wingers lean towards non-belief but their ideology requires them to never criticize non-whites, so consistent anti-theists like Richard Dawkins, Christopher Hitchens or Sam Harris end up out in the wilderness, hated by both the right and the left.

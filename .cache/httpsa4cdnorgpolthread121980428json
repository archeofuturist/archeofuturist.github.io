Raised riding horses and raised shooting bows. they traveled with their cities and families in caravans and they moved from place to place.<br><br>The settled vs nomad is an issue because settled civilization prospers out of taxation of production\/trade as well as skilled artisans in their domain learning and sharing knowledge. Meanwhile, nomadic horseman culturally cared zero for any of this. They would prefer to turn cities into pastures to feed their horses. They didn&#039;t need taxation as they could loot, they didn&#039;t need artisans they didn&#039;t need walled cities.<br><br>So settled civilizations like Persia and China would wall themselves off from the nomadic peoples in the steppes and they would fight nonstop for a few thousand years occasionally hitting each other hard but always pretty much balancing out.<br><br>The balance ended with the Mongols who for the next several hundred years made settled civilization weaker than the nomadic alternative. After the Mongols the Islamic World was pretty much at the mercy of whatever nomadic people launched out of the steppe in hiding. Whether that was Timur, the Qajars, the Afshars, the Safavids. Settled civilization was never really able to properly put up a defense against these horsemen tribes ever again. I mean settled civilization was conquered by nomads before but the devastation was minimal enough that society still progressed technologically. That changed with the Mongols onwards.<br><br>There&#039;s a lot more to it obviously but yeah the death throes of the Islamic World began with Mongols","time":1492687813,"resto":121980428,"id":"wuLPyUmD","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":121985558,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)07:36:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121984086\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121984086<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mongols<\/span><br>You called?","time":1492688188,"resto":121980428,"id":"4fB1coCs","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":121985986,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)07:42:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121980428\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121980428<\/a><br>daily reminder that ottofags were not a turkic empire, after the 3rd ruler it fell to ar*b cultists. if it wasn&#039;t for stupid ottofags there would be no such thing as islam now. they genocided turks who opposed this death cult and replaced them with subhumans from middle east. another redpill about islam is that it was taken over by ar*b cultists (umayyads)<br><br>https:\/\/en.m.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Bat<wbr>tle_of_Karbala<br><br>you talk shit about islam, turks and middle east all day but you don&#039;t know anything about them, only retarded memes done thousand times","time":1492688538,"resto":121980428,"id":"xxv5uvZ+","country":"TR","country_name":"Turkey"},{"no":121986292,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)07:46:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121985986\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121985986<\/a><br>https:\/\/en.m.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mua<wbr>wiyah_I<br><br>https:\/\/en.m.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Abu<wbr>_Sufyan_ibn_Harb<br><br>https:\/\/tr.m.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/I._<wbr>Bayezid","time":1492688771,"resto":121980428,"id":"xxv5uvZ+","country":"TR","country_name":"Turkey"},{"no":121986492,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)07:48:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121980428\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121980428<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What&#039;s to blame?<\/span><br><br>Jews?","time":1492688909,"resto":121980428,"id":"q9AfCk4Y","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121986503,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)07:48:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121981632\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121981632<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Islamic World is too late to get into colonialism<\/span><br><br>True, but only because they chose to waste their opportunities - Islamic caliphates controlled the coast of Morocco and the coast of Iberia by the 800&#039;s.<br><br>Which means they could have developed their existing ship technology designed for Indian Ocean trade into the Atlantic, and discovered the Americas centuries before Europeans - but they never did.","filename":"Arabempire_isoch[1]","ext":".png","w":1304,"h":720,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":69,"tim":1492688918406,"time":1492688918,"md5":"MpX8nJ6QNtLcXjY08ZyEIg==","fsize":40465,"resto":121980428,"id":"Ki1ZqIeW","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121986710,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)07:51:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121986292\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121986292<\/a><br>timur (tamerlane) was a turk and he knew what was going on in ottomans and how they were taken over by this cult. he waged war and defeated them but he didn&#039;t annex because he didn&#039;t want another turkic state to get destroyed<br><br>https:\/\/en.m.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ott<wbr>oman_Interregnum<br><br>this was a huge mistake though, the death cult regained power again and you know the rest","time":1492689070,"resto":121980428,"id":"xxv5uvZ+","country":"TR","country_name":"Turkey"},{"no":121986828,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)07:52:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"Fuck Islam.

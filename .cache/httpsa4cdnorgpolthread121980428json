Similar issues have been shared by other Civilizations though, like the Chinese. They were able to get back on their feet so there has to be more to it. How about conversions to Islam?

West China was utterly depopulated by the Mongols and never quite recovered. There were two massive Chinese Empires on the East but they didn&#039;t get hit quite as hard as the Islamic World or West China. Also, after this period China went back into isolation and were able to handle themselves while the Islamic World had a few more events come later on the scale of the Mongol invasions.<br><br>Persia took about 500 years to become majority muslim after the Islamic Conquest, which mostly happened during the Abbasid Caliphate. The Mongols, after putting the region to the sword, ironically saved Persia from become Arabic in identity (like the rest of the middle east) because they put one of their Epics called the Shahnameh into mass production. The Shahnahmeh kept the Persian language essentially stable for the last 1000 years.<br><br>The Semitic populations (Levant, Mesopotamia, Arabia) adopted Arabic quite quickly because their languages were already in that same area and the Quran itself was very influential (it&#039;s basically poetry in Classical Arabic and it spread very quickly).<br><br>Tamerlane was muslim but religion mattered little to it, he was emulating his ancestor Ghengis Khan and the Mongol hordes, that was the prime motivating factor.

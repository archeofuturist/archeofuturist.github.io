Not really laughed, but more like, &quot;oh...you&#039;re on 4chan...&quot; kinda condescending, you know? <br><br>What is going on? 4chan started every good joke and youtube sensation on the internet! <br> Didn&#039;t the gals and guys who are the hacker group Anonymous start out here? What happened? <br><br>Or am I just reading too much into this? What are your thoughts? Have you experienced this as well? Just curious. ^_^","filename":"Crying Girl 1","ext":".jpg","w":300,"h":168,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1493097298823,"time":1493097298,"md5":"E02CZDnsWSBsAxTgaUlUgw==","fsize":9589,"resto":0,"id":"UPf4\/Gyr","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"is-4chan-not-cool-anymore","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

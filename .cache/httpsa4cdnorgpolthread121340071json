The person responsible for carrying out this transplant is also the one who developed a virtual reality system to prepare patients for their new body. An interesting take on things. as it goes to show VR technology has quite some intriguing use cases most people would not think of at first.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;To be more specific, Professor Sergio Canavero has developed a virtual reality-based system that allows the patient to get acquainted with his future body. This is a crucial development, as it will be quite a shock to the patient to suddenly control a body capable of walking. It is impossible to imagine what such a patient will go through once they awake from the procedure, assuming that will happen in the first place.<\/span><br><br>https:\/\/themerkle.com\/head-transpla<wbr>nt-patient-to-undergo-vr-training\/<br><br>Will it be successful? <br>I want to be transplanted into a loli body...","filename":"an-italian-surgeon-has-renewed-his-promise-to-perform-the-worlds-first-head-transplant-after-a-proof-of-concept-experiment-on-a-dog","ext":".jpg","w":834,"h":625,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1492334190344,"time":1492334190,"md5":"AqNtJ0xNBp0GpeejAg5gng==","fsize":33606,"resto":0,"id":"vcEzSGv8","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"worlds-first-head-transplant-patient-to-undergo","country_name":"United States","replies":50,"images":11,"unique_ips":40},{"no":121340248,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)05:19:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"Just look how happy the donor is.","filename":"1492031002656","ext":".jpg","w":492,"h":492,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492334345361,"time":1492334345,"md5":"ScsmbySO6I\/J\/ewCqwsiew==","fsize":44059,"resto":121340071,"id":"pYZnro5h","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121340372,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)05:20:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121340071\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121340071<\/a><br>Whacko Dago","filename":"Dr-Sergio-Canavero","ext":".png","w":553,"h":250,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":56,"tim":1492334454296,"time":1492334454,"md5":"CFtsR\/Z0\/OHyzoWvjacowA==","fsize":166695,"resto":121340071,"id":"vLTFjI8T","country":"IN","country_name":"India"},{"no":121340454,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)05:22:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"Metal Gear reference?","time":1492334531,"resto":121340071,"id":"BXT+pHEz","country":"CZ","country_name":"Czech Republic"},{"no":121340745,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)05:26:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"he&#039;s going to be retarded","time":1492334779,"resto":121340071,"id":"roAMT7\/F","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121340975,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)05:29:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121340071\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121340071<\/a><br>a head transplant? so you`re telling me they managed to preserve a humans consciousness in his body and then relocate it into a head that was transplanted on that body? thats crazy, last time i checked doctors were still experimenting with full body transplants where they attach somebodys head to a different body, therefore transplanting the body and not the head.","time":1492334987,"resto":121340071,"id":"CeYz53bY","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":121341044,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)05:30:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"Sooo, doesn&#039;t the brain loose braincells once oxygen(or blood?) stop reaching eat?

The monkey lived 8 days and was, by all measures, normal, having suffered no complications.[ 28 ] A few years later, he wrote: \u201c\u2026What has been accomplished in the animal model \u2013 prolonged hypothermic preservation and cephalic transplantation, is fully accomplishable in the human sphere. Whether such dramatic procedures will ever be justified in the human area must wait not only upon the continued advance of medical science but more appropriately the moral and social justification of such procedural undertakings.\u201d[ 29 ] In 1999, he predicted that \u201c\u2026what has always been the stuff of science fiction - the Frankenstein legend, in which an entire human being is constructed by sewing various body parts together \u2013 will become a clinical reality early in the 21st century\u2026 brain transplantation, at least initially, will really be head transplantation \u2013 or body transplantation, depending on your perspective\u2026 with the significant improvements in surgical techniques and postoperative management since then, it is now possible to consider adapting the head-transplant technique to humans.\u201d[ 30 ]<\/span><br><br>Now they believe they can reattach some\/most of the nerves giving partial functionality.<br>http:\/\/surgicalneurologyint.com\/sur<wbr>gicalint-articles\/heaven-the-head-a<wbr>nastomosis-venture-project-outline-<wbr>for-the-first-human-head-transplant<wbr>ation-with-spinal-linkage-gemini\/","time":1492336616,"resto":121340071,"id":"k4r\/F9ef","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121342919,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)05:57:10","name":"Anonymous","filename":"asefgsdf","ext":".png","w":450,"h":300,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1492336630614,"time":1492336630,"md5":"6PmJul8x4fCk4N80COT9+w==","fsize":254847,"resto":121340071,"id":"uHzK+fBp","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121342925,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)05:57:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121341319\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121341319<\/a><br>Proofs ?","time":1492336635,"resto":121340071,"id":"hWBfdDQW","country":"HR","country_name":"Croatia"},{"no":121342941,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)05:57:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121342588\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121342588<\/a><br><br><br>Won&#039;t be long before we have hamplanets hunting and killing attractive young girls with the same blood type in order to take their bodies over, and devastate them with the same rapacious hunger that they inflicted on their former selves.","filename":"0004 - RTR61hf","ext":".png","w":440,"h":470,"tn_w":117,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492336649345,"time":1492336649,"md5":"Kl8YVlKl0oGUXDsVDpsrnA==","fsize":71507,"resto":121340071,"id":"KXD1f8Bm","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121343018,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)05:58:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121341316\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121341316<\/a><br>-15 actually","time":1492336724,"resto":121340071,"id":"NHujiKJQ","country":"RO","country_name":"Romania"},{"no":121343019,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)05:58:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"Here&#039;s an odd concept to think about:<br>If he has sex and conceives, is it his kid or the donor&#039;s kid?","time":1492336724,"resto":121340071,"id":"pJqVPiaA","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121343031,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)05:58:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121342941\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121342941<\/a><br>I&#039;d be more worried about ourselves anon.

The person responsible for carrying out this transplant is also the one who developed a virtual reality system to prepare patients for their new body. An interesting take on things. as it goes to show VR technology has quite some intriguing use cases most people would not think of at first.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;To be more specific, Professor Sergio Canavero has developed a virtual reality-based system that allows the patient to get acquainted with his future body. This is a crucial development, as it will be quite a shock to the patient to suddenly control a body capable of walking. It is impossible to imagine what such a patient will go through once they awake from the procedure, assuming that will happen in the first place.<\/span><br><br>https:\/\/themerkle.com\/head-transpla<wbr>nt-patient-to-undergo-vr-training\/<br><br>Will it be successful? <br>I want to be transplanted into a loli body...","filename":"an-italian-surgeon-has-renewed-his-promise-to-perform-the-worlds-first-head-transplant-after-a-proof-of-concept-experiment-on-a-dog","ext":".jpg","w":834,"h":625,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1492334190344,"time":1492334190,"md5":"AqNtJ0xNBp0GpeejAg5gng==","fsize":33606,"resto":0,"id":"vcEzSGv8","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"worlds-first-head-transplant-patient-to-undergo","country_name":"United States","replies":183,"images":51,"unique_ips":106,"tail_size":50},{"no":121340248,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)05:19:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"Just look how happy the donor is.","filename":"1492031002656","ext":".jpg","w":492,"h":492,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492334345361,"time":1492334345,"md5":"ScsmbySO6I\/J\/ewCqwsiew==","fsize":44059,"resto":121340071,"id":"pYZnro5h","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121340372,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)05:20:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121340071\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121340071<\/a><br>Whacko Dago","filename":"Dr-Sergio-Canavero","ext":".png","w":553,"h":250,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":56,"tim":1492334454296,"time":1492334454,"md5":"CFtsR\/Z0\/OHyzoWvjacowA==","fsize":166695,"resto":121340071,"id":"vLTFjI8T","country":"IN","country_name":"India"},{"no":121340454,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)05:22:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"Metal Gear reference?","time":1492334531,"resto":121340071,"id":"BXT+pHEz","country":"CZ","country_name":"Czech Republic"},{"no":121340745,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)05:26:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"he&#039;s going to be retarded","time":1492334779,"resto":121340071,"id":"roAMT7\/F","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121340975,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)05:29:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121340071\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121340071<\/a><br>a head transplant? so you`re telling me they managed to preserve a humans consciousness in his body and then relocate it into a head that was transplanted on that body? thats crazy, last time i checked doctors were still experimenting with full body transplants where they attach somebodys head to a different body, therefore transplanting the body and not the head.","time":1492334987,"resto":121340071,"id":"CeYz53bY","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":121341044,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)05:30:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"Sooo, doesn&#039;t the brain loose braincells once oxygen(or blood?) stop reaching eat?

Once R&#039;s head has been detached, it must be joined to D&#039;s body, that is, it must be reconnected to the circulatory flow of D, within the hour.[29,30,31] Mammals can be sustained without blood flow for 1 hour at most when cooled to the accepted safe lower limit of 12-15\u00b0C: At a temperature of 15\u00b0C, the cerebral metabolic rate in man is 10% of normal. Recovery following circulatory arrest for as long as 1 hour has been reported at &lt;20\u00b0C temperatures since the 1950s.[13,15] Profound hypothermia (PH) curtails the onset of global ischemia and give time to the surgeons to reconnect the bodies.<\/span><br><br>Clinical experience in cardiac surgery has demonstrated that total circulatory arrest under deep hypothermia (18\u00b0C) for 45 minutes produces virtually no discernible neurological damage, with a slight increase on approaching the hour.[16,34] Experience with surgical clipping of aneurysms shows the safety of the procedure.[22]<br><br>R&#039;s blood subjected to PH tends to become coagulopathic: Accordingly, R&#039;s head will be exsanguinated before linkage, and flushed with iced (4\u00b0C) Ringer&#039;s lactate.[2,13]<br><br>Hypothermia can be achieved in several ways,[2] but, in this particular endeavor, it will not involve total body extracorporeal circulation (TBEC), in order to avoid the attendant ill effects (brain damage and coagulopathy), and make the procedure as simple and as cheap as possible.<br><br>White developed a special form of PH, which he named autocerebral hypothermic perfusion (ACHP).[32] No pumps or oxygenators are called for [Figure 1].

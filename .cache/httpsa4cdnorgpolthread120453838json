My name is Jared Kushner. I&#039;m 36 years old. I believe in taking care of myself, and a balanced diet and a rigorous exercise routine. In the morning, if my face is a little puffy, I&#039;ll put on an ice pack while doing my stomach crunches. I can do a thousand now. After I remove the ice pack, I use a deep pore cleanser lotion. In the shower, I use a water activated gel cleanser. Then a honey almond body scrub. And on the face, an exfoliating gel scrub. Then apply an herb mint facial mask, which I leave on for 10 minutes while I prepare the rest of my routine. I always use an aftershave lotion with little or no alcohol, because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look older. Then moisturizer, then an anti-aging eye balm followed by a final moisturizing protective lotion. <br><br>There is an idea of a Jared Kushner, some kind of abstraction, but there is no real me. Only an entity, something illusory. And though I can hide my cold gaze, and you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping yours and maybe you can even sense our life styles are probably comparable, I simply am not there","filename":"C869k_tVwAApneu.jpg-small","ext":".jpg","w":522,"h":443,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":106,"tim":1491842494723,"time":1491842494,"md5":"XEq1gESHRE\/upnKyHCm\/Ag==","fsize":48452,"resto":120453838,"id":"ZwUAVY7V","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120456654,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)12:41:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120456559\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120456559<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Choose your weapon<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Krod choose SURPRISE!<\/span>","time":1491842512,"resto":120453838,"id":"seF1H+m4","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120456669,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)12:42:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120456559\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120456559<\/a><br>This<br><br>So many of our problems would be solved if we could just solve our differences with bullets","time":1491842524,"resto":120453838,"id":"wbzMidn4","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":120456676,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)12:42:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120455360\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120455360<\/a><br><a href=\"#p120455966\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120455966<\/a><br><a href=\"#p120456245\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120456245<\/a><br><br>worth a read.<br>http:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/mexi<wbr>can-designers-trumps-border-wall-co<wbr>st-2017-4\/#the-proposed-divider-is-<wbr>a-megalomaniac-architectural-propos<wbr>al-he-says-8","filename":"according-to-the-design-americans-would-enjoy-a-shopping-mall-thats-built-into-the-wall-too","ext":".jpg","w":1200,"h":687,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":71,"tim":1491842528903,"time":1491842528,"md5":"+LzI4pzEEuvPb9ggauyPag==","fsize":124305,"resto":120453838,"id":"lcvstXg0","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":120456681,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)12:42:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120456499\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120456499<\/a><br>kek","filename":"1490138713870","ext":".jpg","w":960,"h":960,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491842534073,"time":1491842534,"md5":"Co3KiBM49mIWGEI3xM+WPg==","fsize":151462,"resto":120453838,"id":"Kyj1cGwE","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120456684,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)12:42:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Trump calling Schumer a lightweight in a press briefing<\/span><br>aaahaha","filename":"1489832279902","ext":".gif","w":500,"h":282,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1491842536147,"time":1491842536,"md5":"9fE5\/zFChe5sU72sLy\/3Fg==","fsize":269402,"resto":120453838,"id":"OTkiwHjg","country":"JP","country_name":"Japan"},{"no":120456704,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)12:42:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120456519\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120456519<\/a><br>It&#039;s a valid question and I honestly think the answer is there is no such thing as a PhD holding economist that&#039;s also a nationalist.

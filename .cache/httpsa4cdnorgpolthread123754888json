Aside from the influence of \u201cfake news,\u201d the betrayal of white women towards the mythical sisterhood (because all women think alike, don\u2019t you know?), and the \u201cignorance\u201d of the conservative voting bloc, one particular group of politically-active millennial voters is brought up time and time again as a prime reason for Trump\u2019s win at the polls: the anime-loving denizens of4chan.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Writing forNew York Magazine, formerGawkerchief Max Readattempts to deconstructthe labyrinthian memeverse that is now the Internet\u2014a social environment riddled with inside jokes and postmodernist hot takes. Referencing 4chan, Read argues that the Internet is now a message board because the \u201cself-proclaimed losers and freaks of 4chan and its ilk had come to great political prominence\u201d upon Trump\u2019s election. After all, he argues, Hillary Clinton waged war against a cartoon frog.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;To credit memes for so much of Trump\u2019s success, however, is to bestow power upon the very memes that the progressive left battles daily. Fighting against memes, which are viral by nature, is to infect your audience with an awareness of their existence, which in turn grants them even more power. Were it not for the constant outrage against Pepe the Frog, the \u201cOK\u201d sign as a \u201cwhite supremacist gesture,\u201d and numerous other spawn ofReddit,Twitterand4chan, these symbols would hold no meaning outside the bubbles in which they were formed.<\/span><br><br>https:\/\/heatst.com\/culture-wars\/the<wbr>-internets-endless-war-to-seize-the<wbr>-memes-of-production\/<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;tfw WE WUZ NEWZ now..<\/span>","filename":"Screenshot_2017-05-02-17-38-58_1","ext":".jpg","w":1080,"h":1306,"tn_w":206,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493721918680,"time":1493721918,"md5":"eElRG\/mVNViUZqI4egE4xQ==","fsize":190129,"resto":0,"id":"nrk97Uoa","country":"CA","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-whole-world-now-is-a-message-board","country_name":"Canada","replies":2,"images":0,"unique_ips":1},{"no":123754928,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)06:45:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"Read argues that the victory of memes over the masses was \u201calmost a thrilling underdog story\u201d if not for the fact that they are \u201canti-Enlightenment, anti-democratic, anti-equality politics,\u201d a claim that exudes not only arrogance, but false authority.

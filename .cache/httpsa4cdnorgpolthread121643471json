On the way back their MRAP flipped and we had to save their asses. Special forces are special snowflakes, they think they own the entire US military. They stroke their ego all the time about how tough they are, and yet its instantly shattered when some grunts have to tow their flipped MRAP back to base.","time":1492494777,"resto":121643471,"id":"5n6HoCrE","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121646772,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)01:54:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121646402\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121646402<\/a><br>Nah m8.

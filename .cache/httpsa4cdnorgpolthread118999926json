The only reason the U.S. gov. supported him was because the Dems wanted blacks to vote for them. The saddest part of the whole story is that nothing was gained, because Malcom X&#039;s message of &quot;outbreeding whitey&quot; was much more popular and endures in the black community today. MLK jr. is barely a figurehead nowaday.<br><br>As a side note, the only reason Ghandi chose peaceful protest was because stupid Pajeets couldn&#039;t figure out how to use guns.

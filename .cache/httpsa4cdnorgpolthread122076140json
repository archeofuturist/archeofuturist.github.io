Starts with a fallacy right off the bat. Selective breeding is completely different from directly modifying DNA.<br><br>GMOs are not proven to be harmless. There are many cases of food substances being classified as safe, or acceptable, for dozens of years, and later reclassified as dangerous. See transfats as the easiest example of this. It takes a very long time for scientists to properly research the effects of food substances. You can&#039;t trust the FDA. They allow food substances to be sold to consumers without nearly enough research proving their safety. There aren&#039;t enough studies on GMOs yet.","time":1492739430,"resto":122076140,"id":"\/R+EwZbH","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122078760,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)21:52:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122076140\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122076140<\/a><br><br>The whole subject is too hyped up.

I&#039;d be careful saying that after 1935 when Pilsudski died, everything went downhill from there. Poland was practically fascist, and had it&#039;s own ambitions against Germany, Russia, parts of Ukraine and the Czech area. It&#039;s true that there were some efforts by Poland to get the Brits and French into a war with Germany, and there are maps with Poland&#039;s border crossing into western Germany. And Germans were killed by the hundreds before the war just for being Germans in a new Polish state. The situation between ethnic Germans and the new Polish state was a humanitarian catastrophe and Hitler asked the League of Nations to help but nothing was done.","time":1490716973,"resto":118658870,"id":"RJKG63uZ","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":118662875,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)12:04:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118658870\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118658870<\/a><br>Looks like that scene from Python&#039;s Holy grail.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;But I&#039;m not dead yet&quot;<\/span>","time":1490717077,"resto":118658870,"id":"7HD+QXcj","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118663259,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)12:08:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118659640\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118659640<\/a><br>This.

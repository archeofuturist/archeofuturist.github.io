After doing a little bit of thinking about history and the way europe developed I started to think about how much of europe was divided into aristocrats on the one hand and agrarian serfs on the other hand. There were some places on the fringes of europe like ireland that had much of their economy based on pastoralism as opposed to the feudal agrarian model.<br>And so if we look at the modern world the modern world is basically a world dominated by the middle class. The middle class is largely descended of agrarian serfs. The vikings were basically the aristocrats and warrior classes. So basically in modern scandinavia the culture is dominated by the culture of serfs, by what the vikings called the thrall classes.<br>The aristocrats tended to have an honor culture. Pastoral cultures tend to have honor cultures. Agrarian serfs did often have a sense of honor but it was less so. The agrarian serfs were a very castrated people. And so this modern politically correct culture that is very restrictive is a manifestation of the cowardly nature of thralls.<br>It seems upper class and lower working class people seem to have a sense of honor and that middle class people tend to be more bland and castrated and I think that the major problem in the west is domination by the middle classes. And my explanation for the behavior of the middle classes is that they tend to be descended of agrarian serfs. To put it in a norse way: the thralls are in charge and this is why things are what they are in scandinavia, and it is so bad that thrall values have become equated with the scandinavian male even though not all scandinavian males practice such values.<br>The norse sagas were not the sagas oof the nordic people per se, they were the sagas of the nordic aristocrats and warriors. Most nordic people were serfs, were thralls. And it is the thralls who dominate sweden today.","filename":"salman","ext":".png","w":800,"h":600,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1490932305657,"time":1490932305,"md5":"F+zw0blqEZ+3S1U07DA25A==","fsize":629390,"resto":0,"id":"fNN7H5C5","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-thrall-domination-of-sweden","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":119017872,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)00:11:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119015951\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119015951<\/a><br>You are on to something, most of the brave and strong men left Scandanavia to settle other shores, seek wealth and fame, meanwhile the meek, the thralls and fat Kings grew soft, isolated from the rest of the world.","time":1490933472,"resto":119015951,"id":"UzfUnQvG","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

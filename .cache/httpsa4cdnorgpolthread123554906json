Our tactics will never work because lefties will always be ready to intervene whenever we are doing something very stupid. We are misogynist because it&#039;s fun and we enjoy hating and hurting women who did nothing wrong to us, but I think we should give up on those kinds of senseless tactics since it doesn&#039;t improve misogyny&#039;s image. I suggest we try to grow up instead of making hateful fake news hand picture images.","time":1493604018,"resto":123554906,"id":"c60pN9BP","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":123561584,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)22:00:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123561342\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123561342<\/a><br>Great movie","time":1493604058,"resto":123554906,"id":"D9xNm64t","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123561686,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)22:01:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123561584\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123561584<\/a><br>Classic","time":1493604112,"resto":123554906,"id":"XkDJjrub","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123561708,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)22:02:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123554906\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123554906<\/a><br>Lefties?

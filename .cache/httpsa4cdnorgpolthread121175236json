In China, knife attacks are happening so often in schools, that many teachers are armed with long sticks with a U shape at the end to hold off knife attackers. <br><br>There is actually little correlation when relating homicide and gun ownership. <br><br>Here are two UN sources on these stats from wikipedia.<br><br>Right off the bat, there are countries such as Sweden, Norway, France, Serbia, Cyprus and Switzerland that have higher gun ownership and significantly lower homicide rates than Canada. Many other countries with about the same gun ownership rates as Canada, but with disproportionally lower homicide rates.<br><br>Putting these results into a plot to find correlation you get: <br>Honestly there is such a low fit and correlation that you cannot say that reducing the amount of firearms in a society will reduce the homicide rate. As a matter of fact, what this data somewhat shows is that MORE firearms reduces the homicide rate!!!<br><br>Many arguments are often made to determine what data should be looked at, developing vs. non developing countries etc. to try to get results that satisfy their agenda. That is just called gaslighting.<br><br>Oh, and check out the Canadian homicide statistics at the bottom of the wikipedia homicide page...It breaks down the rates by province and territory.

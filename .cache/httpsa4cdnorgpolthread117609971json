While on reddit people will just up vote or down vote opinions they like. You can&#039;t do that here. Therefore if you want to best the anon that replied to you, you have to put up good arguments for your thesis. That doesn&#039;t work on reddit since you can post lies and they will up vote them without hesitation, and even if you argue your point it is very likely to be down voted. Reddit likes to live in the dark, meaning that they will up vote what they like and down vote what they don&#039;t.

You don&#039;t even need to create an account, and anonymity shields you from personal attacks and harassment, and that alone is fucking awesome.<br><br>There are two reasons why 4chan and other imageboards went full right:<br>- Leftists are all for censorship. Sure they claim they&#039;re in favor of free speech but then all they talk about is censorship: no holocaust denial, no racism, no hate speech, no insults... oh and no identity so they can personally attack you. As a result, they seldom come here because they find the lack of censorship and political correctness disturbing. But 4chan was never an echo chamber, it was always open to everyone and anything, it&#039;s just that many leftists need their safe space. There&#039;s still more than enough leftists, on top of the frequent raids, to introduce leftist ideas. Which leads us to the next point:<br>- Maybe \/pol\/ is just right. Imageboards are some of those places where people actually discuss, debate, share knowledge, learn, admit they&#039;re wrong, change their minds, evolve... that is, the very opposite of an echo chamber. And all this interaction pushed most of us towards right-wing ideas, not because of a bias towards the right, simply becaues our discussions had many of us converge to the same truth. If anyone wants to prove us wrong, he&#039;s welcome to come have a chat with us, but most leftists won&#039;t come in here, the few that do lack the ability to debate in a civil manner, they lack the skills to hold a coherent discourse, and in the end the few that remain end up steering towards the right.<br><br>I mean, why do they have to criticize us form the safety of their own echo chamber? Why don&#039;t they come in here and tell us so we can have a chat? They&#039;re welcome in here, yet we&#039;re not welcome on reddit, and I guess that alone says everything.<br><br>Now if you&#039;ll excuse me, I&#039;ll be out buying more keks.","filename":"1489661296083","ext":".jpg","w":762,"h":1139,"tn_w":83,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490092096080,"time":1490092096,"md5":"QCb6NlS6uH3RfG1mhvEJaw==","fsize":336637,"resto":117609971,"id":"ZJZm\/FPS","country":"FR","m_img":1,"country_name":"France"},{"no":117612394,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)06:28:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"I agree with 4chan on many things except Jews.

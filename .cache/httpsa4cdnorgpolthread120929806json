People lived solitary, uncomplicated lives. Their few needs were easily satisfied by nature. Because of the abundance of nature and the small size of the population, competition was non-existent, and persons rarely even saw one another, much less had reason for conflict or fear. Moreover, these simple, morally pure persons were naturally endowed with the capacity for pity, and therefore were not inclined to bring harm to one another.<br><br>As time passed, however, humanity faced certain changes. As the overall population increased, the means by which people could satisfy their needs had to change. People slowly began to live together in small families, and then in small communities. Divisions of labor were introduced, both within and between families, and discoveries and inventions made life easier, giving rise to leisure time. Such leisure time inevitably led people to make comparisons between themselves and others, resulting in public values, leading to shame and envy, pride and contempt. Most importantly however, according to Rousseau, was the invention of private property, which constituted the pivotal moment in humanity&#039;s evolution out of a simple, pure state into one characterized by greed, competition, vanity, inequality, and vice. For Rousseau the invention of property constitutes humanity\u2019s \u2018fall from grace\u2019 out of the State of Nature.","time":1492103569,"resto":120929806,"id":"pV+46Khm","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120933102,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)13:13:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"It sounds like a very decent religion, especially compared to many others (as seen today).

Some have property and others are forced to work for them, and the development of social classes begins. Eventually, those who have property notice that it would be in their interests to create a government that would protect private property from those who do not have it but can see that they might be able to acquire it by force. So, government gets established, through a contract, which purports to guarantee equality and protection for all, even though its true purpose is to fossilize the very inequalities that private property has produced. In other words, the contract, which claims to be in the interests of everyone equally, is really in the interests of the few who have become stronger and richer as a result of the developments of private property. This is the naturalized social contract, which Rousseau views as responsible for the conflict and competition from which modern society suffers.<br><br>The normative social contract, argued for by Rousseau in The Social Contract (1762), is meant to respond to this sorry state of affairs and to remedy the social and moral ills that have been produced by the development of society. The distinction between history and justification, between the factual situation of mankind and how it ought to live together, is of the utmost importance to Rousseau. While we ought not to ignore history, nor ignore the causes of the problems we face, we must resolve those problems through our capacity to choose how we ought to live. Might never makes right, despite how often it pretends that it can.","time":1492103612,"resto":120929806,"id":"pV+46Khm","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120933297,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)13:14:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120932794\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120932794<\/a><br>That just looks like water foam from the waves crashing about","time":1492103667,"resto":120929806,"id":"4De\/\/29L","country":"CO","country_name":"Colombia"},{"no":120933309,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)13:14:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120932794\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120932794<\/a><br>That&#039;s a bag nigga","time":1492103673,"resto":120929806,"id":"kLtces6A","country":"PA","country_name":"Panama"},{"no":120933864,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)13:19:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120929806\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120929806<\/a><br>After living in Japan, I consider Shinto my prime religion.

You might remember an anon a while ago that posted about his porn addiction and wrote a short text on why porn was probably the cause that males are so cucked in recent years. At the time a lot of that came from reading past the NoFap\u2019s movement loads of anecdotal evidence and bro-science and examining some of its valid points. But alas, I was not satisfied.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;There was something there. Something that wanted to be found.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I\u2019ve gone off and done actual research \u2014 anonymous interviews recruiting around boards, lots of books on the field of Sexology (back when Psychology was real and before the field became fetishistic bullshit and tranny justifications, so some odd forty years ago) and other heaps of bullshit, trying to sort the delusional from the actual knowledge from outright kike lies.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;This is going to be quite long. I\u2019ll examine the crux of the issue first, then go off and examine several rising fetishes and the dangers of several kinds of thinking, concluding with suggestions of how you \u2014 yes, you \u2014 should behave to create the new male, the one that should rise from this swamp of leftist crap. By no means is this a defeatist or M.G.T.O.W.-supporting text \u2014 I think this issue should be fixed, but it starts with you.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;If you have any of the issues described in this essay, please seek to improve yourself. Realize it isn\u2019t natural to you, and seek to stop them.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Here we go.<\/span>","time":1491285151,"resto":119433366,"id":"ohCGKPJ9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119438117,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)01:54:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119437920\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119437920<\/a><br><br>[2]<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The Modern Times, the Downfall of Masculine Thinking and Autogynephilia<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;First of all, let us examine the recent events on the world that have changed how the modern human views sexuality. Not only have family values gone down \u2014 rather, I\u2019d say, fucking plummeted \u2014 but the rise of fast-access Internet Porn, filled with all kinds of imagery, have also corrupted the youth\u2019s natural sexual development. With sex viewed as just a way of release and said pornography widely available, the modern teenager \u2014 and many of you, I\u2019m sure \u2014 was quick to hop in the internet porn bandwagon, also in an era where sex became more acceptable to talk about in public and media.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Now, many of you could confirm and well, common sense also shows that the first fantasies of the human male, and the types of video he watches, are usually simple, heterosexual videos of a man and a woman, or a man and several women, with intercourse being dominated by the male. Many even quickly go to fetishes such as forced intercourse, with domination by their part being the crux of the original, male fetish. This is in accordance with natural male sexual thought \u2014 not that we want to just go off and rape people, but rather, that we seek our own pleasure, the usage of our genital organs on women we find attractive to find release.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Now, my interviews had a disturbing common point at about this stage \u2014 as humans are humans and excess is the key to change, many of them lost interest and switched to other forms of pornography. The thing that disturbed me is that almost all of them \u2014 a staggering 80% of a control group of quite a few dozen \u2014 switched to lesbian porn. Porn of a woman, with another woman.<\/span>","time":1491285291,"resto":119433366,"id":"ohCGKPJ9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119438216,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)01:56:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119438117\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119438117<\/a><br><br>[3]<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Now, many of you will argue that\u2019s natural. A heterosexual male does not want to see penises, and before, many males simply got off to pictures of nude women on magazines. But to explain why this is actually harmful, I have to get into autogynephilia. (Don\u2019t worry, this eventually comes around and explains all forms of porn are kinda awful for the brain. Not defending \u201cdicks &gt; tits\u201d here)<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Autogynephilia was a concept introduced in sexology that was quickly shot down as \u201ctransphobic\u201d since it implied men who have a desire to be women developed this delusion as part of this issue, rather than being born trannies as lefties imply. That the establishment \u2014 or the kike, if your prefer \u2014 denied this so readily is no fucking coincidence. Because here lies the crux of the issue.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Autogynephilia describes a mental issue where the man is physically aroused by the thought of projecting himself as the woman during sex \u2014 and this has SKYROCKETED in recent years. And the very core of this problem is a brain mismatch over pleasure: instead of associating his penis \u2014 and the act of inserting said penis into a woman \u2014 with pleasure, the man instead associates parts of the female body with pleasure. While this may seem normal, this means that the man associates sexy and getting off not with his male ejaculation, but with the release and moans of the female.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;This is where we come back to lesbian porn. There is no male \u2014 at all \u2014 for the man to project himself into. Unlike magazine pictures \u2014 where the fantasy came from imagining you, yourself, fucking that hot woman \u2014 there\u2019s nowhere for the man to project himself. Watching two women have sex is just that \u2014 you\u2019re getting off to that, because your natural male brain finds the female parts arousing, but in the background, you\u2019re learning, molding your brain, to associating their moans and releases with pleasure, instead of your own.<\/span>","time":1491285370,"resto":119433366,"id":"ohCGKPJ9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119438400,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)01:58:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119438216\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119438216<\/a><br><br>[4]<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Now we take a short detour into the culture of sex in media at the time.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Before, it was unacceptable to even mention the sexual on TV or media, but with feminism and the sexual revolution, it was suddenly fucking OK to talk about dick sizes on modern television. With this bullshit, started the concerns that \u201cwomen were sexually frustrated\u201d (there\u2019s little evidence for this bullcrap, except if you were an abusive husband) and also the fucking fetishization of the length of the male penis. I won\u2019t argue this has no effect on sexual performance, but the average female vagina only goes in for five or six inches, about the average male penis. Their main center of pleasure requires no length to reach, and the famed G-spot is about three inches in, a bit curve upwards \u2014 so this was mostly rumours, a new way for women to belittle males in their newfound would-be \u201csexual superiority\u201d, where they now controlled the terms of engagement. Men became obsessed whether they were good enough \u2014 and in my opinion that stress, that constant newfound concern if they could please the woman up to these absurd standards, coupled with the fetish slope described above, adapted many minds to seek fetishes in which their participation or performance was not as important to non-existent \u2014 from seemingly innocent shit like simply being dominated by a woman to gay sex and even cuckold porn.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Of 20 guys interviewed who said their main fetish was crossdressing\/trapping themselves, one of them taking female hormones, ALL twenty confirmed the slope in porn seen above, from straight porn to rape to lesbian to transexual porn and so forth.<\/span>","time":1491285509,"resto":119433366,"id":"ohCGKPJ9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119438460,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)01:59:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119438400\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119438400<\/a><br><br>[5]<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Because they derive their pleasure from more female sources which they\u2019ve been associating it with \u2014 be it replacing the woman during sex, taking the submissive role or even seeing another guy with women, something that could start from even normal, heterosexual pornography \u2014 this form of getting off, coupled with the natural dopamine rush of an act considered tabboo in their minds, causes many men to swerve to this side of the curve.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u201cBut it\u2019s just fetishes, I don\u2019t act out on them on real life.\u201d<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;But they\u2019re still acting on you, and even then, there\u2019s no guarantee it stays that way forever. All four fucking trannies I managed to interview, plus one who had started hormone treatment, said that they didn\u2019t identify as female before going very deep into a crossdressing\/\u201dsissy\u201d (as they call forced feminization fetishes) fetish before making the decision. This is actually such an issue in the tranny community they often have FAQs on the issue and several sites discuss where to draw the line between fetishism and the \u201creal thing\u201d. (Even though I\u2019d argue one\u2019s just a harsher form of the other, really.)<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In short: The pornography slippery slope causes you to take a dark path, autogynphilia developing to some degree whether your new fetish is getting raped by monster girls or being a trap, you should know that shit is NOT natural.

Those people don&#039;t react on Trump&#039;s missteps as harshly, whereas those that internalized Trump&#039;s candidacy as electing a super-human all-knowing behemoth that will solve literally everything already started to become disillusioned by his term&#039;s second week, and just now decided to openly voice their complaints.<br>I do believe that there might be shills, there might be russian propaganda, trying to swerve \/pol\/ as a whole to one side or the other, but even then, I believe that there is a shard of truth to both sides.

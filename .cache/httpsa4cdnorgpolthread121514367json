One can learn that he is a seventh-generation descendant of dynasty founder Mayer Amschel, and that as the great-grandson of &quot;the Benefactor&quot; he controls the Caesarea Edmond Benjamin de Rothschild Foundation. The foundation, through the management of the Caesarea community, provides financial support for education in Israel and has land and cash holdings worth more than NIS 700 million. Googling also reveals that the baron controls private banks in France and Switzerland, owns a number of the world&#039;s most famous palaces and wineries and is very fond of sports, particularly sailing. He rarely gives interviews; there are a handful of articles about him in the French press but none in the English-language media and certainly not in the Israeli media.<br><br>We were on the way to interview Baron Benjamin de Rothschild, the last scion of the dynasty&#039;s French branch, who is considered the world&#039;s richest Rothschild today.<br><br>http:\/\/www.haaretz.com\/israel-news\/<wbr>family-values-1.323094","filename":"17596461_1752622375029287_3977449649526013952_n","ext":".jpg","w":480,"h":480,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492428130512,"time":1492428130,"md5":"rFVnCGxoF1\/ypbvbmbyxbA==","fsize":45564,"resto":121514367,"id":"uX1zOMfU","country":"CH","country_name":"Switzerland"},{"no":121514557,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)07:23:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121514431\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121514431<\/a><br>5 star hotel President Wilson is located within 1 mile from their house. President Wilson was the person, who signed the creation of FED act, giving Rothschild monopoly of printing the US dollars out of thin air and lending it to US Gov on interest.<br><br>Long story shot in 1910 a few powerful yet rothschild-backed bankers met at Jeckyll Island to plan the creation of the bank of Federal Reserve (FED). They chose to promote Woodrow Wilson to presidency, to realize their plan. Once they promoted him to office, he did his bidding and signed the Creation of Feredal Reserve Bank act, which since then is 100% owned by the Rothschilds. It means they print money out of thin air and lend it to US Government on interest(hence endless debt in society).<br><br>As a thank you, Rothschilds build a President Wilson hotel one mile from where they reside in Geneva.

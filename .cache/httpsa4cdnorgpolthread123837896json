There are irregularities in Assad&#039;s account that make me think that while the government isn&#039;t responsible, they goofed in such a way that they can&#039;t prove they weren&#039;t somehow contributing to this being possible. But ultimately, I don&#039;t think it matters what happened so much as what came of it. In its limited capacity, the Syria strike was more a statement to other countries than it was to Assad, since it didn&#039;t actually materially affect his ability to wage war. It also didn&#039;t change Trump&#039;s policy long term, seeing as how he recently stopped Erdogan from advancing against the Kurds and Assad and today&#039;s call with Putin said that they were both looking forward to reaching a diplomatic solution in Syria and would be meeting in person at G20. It&#039;s a mess and I think it&#039;s the long term view that&#039;ll be more relevant than this incident, muddled as it is.","time":1493770056,"resto":123837896,"id":"V1Z6NMFC","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":123841972,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)20:09:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123841474\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123841474<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The only way is to start from scratch<\/span><br>This is my deep down dark desire.

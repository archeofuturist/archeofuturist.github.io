They include an electoral board decision to accept ballots that did not bear official stamps, as required by Turkish law.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The White House says Trump and Erdogan also discussed Trump&#039;s decision to bomb a Syrian regime airfield in response to a chemical weapons attack that killed dozens. Trump thanked Erdogan for supporting the action.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Critics argue the reforms in Turkey will hand extensive power to a man with an increasingly autocratic bent and leave few checks and balances in place.<\/span><br><br>http:\/\/www.ctvnews.ca\/world\/white-h<wbr>ouse-trump-congratulates-erdogan-af<wbr>ter-disputed-win-1.3372667","filename":"image","ext":".jpg","w":620,"h":349,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":140,"tim":1492480842667,"time":1492480842,"md5":"mW8zpQPAE4ccQfCEEHDAqg==","fsize":82367,"resto":0,"id":"WTNx0RO9","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"white-house-trump-congratulates-erdogan-after","country_name":"Canada","replies":6,"images":2,"unique_ips":5},{"no":121621376,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)22:09:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"Based Sultan Erdogan.<br>Democracy was a mistake.<br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=CFa<wbr>4UNmdEhg","time":1492481350,"resto":121620300,"id":"DAp7gqkB","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":121622185,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)22:15:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121620300\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121620300<\/a><br>As much as I hate that shitstain nation and everything it stands for, I don&#039;t really care if they decide to give democracy the boot or not.

He was serving as president of the Istanbul Youth Group of Erbakan\u2019s National Salvation Party at the time. \u201cMas-Kom-Ya\u201d is a compound acronym for \u201cMasons-Communists-Yahudi\u201d \u2014 \u201cJews\u201d \u2014 and the play focused on the evil nature of these three, whose common denominator was Judaism. When Valley of the Wolves was released in Turkey in 2006, it became the most expensive film ever made in Turkey. The film included a \u201ccinematic motif\u201d which featured an American Jewish doctor dismembering Iraqis allegedly murdered by American soldiers in order to harvest their organs for Jewish markets. At the time, then-Prime Minister Erdogan not only failed to condemn the film, he justified its production and popularity. His wife, Emine, also attended a gala screening of the film and sat next to the movie\u2019s star.<\/span>","filename":"1448588037719-0","ext":".jpg","w":460,"h":620,"tn_w":92,"tn_h":124,"tim":1492481940614,"time":1492481940,"md5":"Es5z6Y74WwhGbJaFZ35+lA==","fsize":108551,"resto":121620300,"id":"Ge1xhs9u","country":"TR","country_name":"Turkey"},{"no":121622744,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)22:20:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121622606\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121622606<\/a><br>Roach, you&#039;ve got a mega-opportunity here, don&#039;t fuck this up.","time":1492482013,"resto":121620300,"id":"G67Sv0Fh","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121622969,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)22:21:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121622744\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121622744<\/a><br><br>hope so. the democracy meme is useless especially in this region","filename":"1467411281897","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":450,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1492482119759,"time":1492482119,"md5":"eK8HVQ5YhUDXDAwKw37Y4A==","fsize":61443,"resto":121620300,"id":"Ge1xhs9u","country":"TR","country_name":"Turkey"}]}

Plato\u2019s Apology tells how Socrates was condemned by the Athenian citizenry for corrupting the morals of the young and doubting the gods. There was some truth to that complaint. Socrates called conventional wisdom into question. He subjected long-standing beliefs to rational scrutiny and speculated about concerns that projected beyond the existing order. What became known as \u201ccritical theory\u201d was built upon this legacy. The new philosophical tendency was generated between World War I and World War II, and its most important representatives would wage an unrelenting assault on the exploitation, repression, and alienation embedded within Western civilization.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Critical theory was conceived within the intellectual crucible of Marxism. But its leading representatives were from the start dismissive of economic determinism, the stage theory of history, and any fatalistic belief in the \u201cinevitable\u201d triumph of socialism. They were concerned less with what Marx called the economic \u201cbase\u201d than the political and cultural \u201csuperstructure\u201d of society. Their Marxism was of a different variety. They highlighted its critical method over its systematic claims, its concern with alienation and reification, its complicated relationship with the ideals of the Enlightenment, its utopian moment, its emphasis upon the role of ideology, and its commitment to resist thedeformation of the individual. This complex of themes constitutes the core of critical theory as it was conceived by the leading figures of \u201cWestern Marxism\u201d: Karl Korsch and Georg Luk\u00e1cs. These two thinkers provided the framework for the critical project that later became identified with the Institute for Social Research\u2014or \u201cthe Frankfurt School.\u201d<\/span>","filename":"41CrGVllAZL._SL500_SX323_BO1,204,203,200_","ext":".jpg","w":325,"h":499,"tn_w":162,"tn_h":249,"tim":1491479707738,"time":1491479707,"md5":"CxHW3uZ3VkJ3k5swYEQALw==","fsize":35663,"resto":0,"id":"HA1CGu7q","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"gultural-margsism","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":5,"images":4,"unique_ips":3},{"no":119735030,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)07:55:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119734985\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119734985<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The Frankfurt School had always considered establishmentarian philosophies as obstacles to bringing about a liberated society. Its members condemned the preoccupation with absolute foundations, analytic categories, and fixed criteria for verifying truth cclaims. They saw two main culprits: phenomenology , with its set ontological claims about how individuals experience existence, and positivism , with its demand that society be analyzed according to the criteria of the natural sciences. Both were attacked for treating society in a-historical terms and eliminating genuine subjectivity.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Critical theory was intended as an alternative. It was fueled by a transformative intent and a particular concern with the culture of modern life.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;These thinkers became champions of an experimental modernist art and, in the charged climate of the postwar period, an \u201cAesopian\u201d form of convoluted writing that shielded their radical beliefs.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;\u201cNegative dialectics\u201d anticipated many concerns associated with postmodernism and poststructuralism. So much so, in fact, that they are now often treated as expressions of critical theory. Deconstructive or poststructuralist approaches invaded the most prestigious journals and disciplines ranging from anthropology and film to religion, linguistics, and political science. They generated new insights on race and gender as well as the postcolonial world.<\/span>","time":1491479740,"resto":119734985,"id":"HA1CGu7q","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119735690,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)08:04:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119734985\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119734985<\/a><br><a href=\"#p119735030\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119735030<\/a><br>Critical Theory = modern-day Sabbateanism aka Jewish satanism<br><br>http:\/\/henrymakow.com\/2016\/01\/Frank<wbr>furt-School-is-Illuminati-Jewish-Sa<wbr>tanism.html<br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=IJe<wbr>W-dyK3hA","filename":"fsjoo30r3","ext":".png","w":509,"h":340,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1491480262151,"time":1491480262,"md5":"lU9b1LMlcdDBwKdFJVez2w==","fsize":149886,"resto":119734985,"id":"HpigCjaI","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":119735946,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)08:07:24","name":"Anonymous","filename":"Cultural marxism as described by marxists","ext":".png","w":1250,"h":3453,"tn_w":45,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491480444849,"time":1491480444,"md5":"lv8DHFFHJQ7BhDFuphtbeQ==","fsize":1091878,"resto":119734985,"id":"HA1CGu7q","country":"GB","m_img":1,"country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119736123,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)08:09:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"Fuck off to your containment board","filename":"leftypol power level","ext":".jpg","w":393,"h":362,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":115,"tim":1491480576412,"time":1491480576,"md5":"492SV5YqWJCgoWJXwY0Y3w==","fsize":37838,"resto":119734985,"id":"t+VyxnWL","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":119736546,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)08:14:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119736123\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119736123<\/a><br>But cultural marxism is the future anon.","filename":"gultural margsism intro","ext":".png","w":1161,"h":8628,"tn_w":16,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491480877808,"time":1491480877,"md5":"tI+ZeEkdUd6yx8C9PtgPsw==","fsize":795727,"resto":119734985,"id":"HA1CGu7q","country":"GB","m_img":1,"country_name":"United Kingdom"}]}

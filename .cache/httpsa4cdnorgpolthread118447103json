The greatest war in human history had caused untold suffering but it had also quite literally blasted open human consciousness as a result of the destruction of old, outworn institutions, habits of living and crystallised thoughtforms that had held humanity in thrall to separatism and materialism, particularly since the time of the Industrial Revolution.&quot;<br><br>&quot;The agony of the war and the distress of the entire human family led the Christ, in 1945, to come to a great decision. He made the decision to emerge again into physical contact with humanity if human beings themselves would bring about the initial stages of establishing right human relations; and He gave to the world one of the oldest prayers ever known, but one which hitherto had not been permitted to be used except by the most exalted spiritual Beings. The Christ Himself used the Great Invocation for the first time in June 1945.&quot;<br><br>Excerpts from the &quot;Lucis Trust&quot; website, originally named &quot;Lucifer publishing&quot;..<br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Dt6<wbr>1ZSduoR4 [Embed]","filename":"obama-handsign-satanic-salute-450x293","ext":".jpg","w":450,"h":293,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":162,"tim":1490575969393,"time":1490575969,"md5":"49EW\/+K+2WEowjFCDozAOg==","fsize":39912,"resto":0,"id":"9eA1NzFR","country":"DO","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"usa-gov-invoked-satan-to-celebrate-germanys","country_name":"Dominican Republic","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

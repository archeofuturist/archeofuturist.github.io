Mitragynine binds to these receptors and improves your mood and gives a euphoric-like feeling, just like opiates such as heroin and opium.

Even though Kratom hasn&#039;t been thoroughly studied, the anecdotal evidence that is hundreds of years old suggests it is much safer as an opiate\/opioid substitute than the pills the medical community has to offer. Not to mention it&#039;s cost effective and no middleman required.

Beats the fuck out of suboxone or methadone.<br>Kratomalliance.com. Try their Papua Green Vein Maeng Da.

I believe our country does a very inadequate job of training young people for work, and apprenticeships are one way to remedy this substantially, many people in America believe that there only chance at good employment is college, so many only know about that or believe it&#039;s their only avenue, and many end up getting degrees which leave them in debt without career prospects, worse off than many people in trade careers anyway.<br><br>Not only that, but the alternative many people face is training via low-skill service jobs such as retail or restaurant work, which are useful for paying for school or bills as a student or living with one&#039;s parents but obviously not as good a career option as plumbing, electrician work, carpentry, etc. What stops the U.S. from having a more European-style apprenticeship-style program and what can we do to create one hopefully?","filename":"AlinaLi1","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":640,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492117753167,"time":1492117753,"md5":"vmU8dphtaXg2c\/JopPAf9A==","fsize":32476,"resto":0,"id":"64huaiR3","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"us-apprenticeships-and-trades","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

Einstein convinced him this was absurd and the continent itself had not moved but the poles had. Einstein even wrote the Foreword for his book. I mean if you moved the pole far enough, Antarctica would have likely been temperate.<br><br>As far as the ice age, you are 100% correct. Infact when you look at the ice core and use that to predict the cycles and look at where we should be, we should be in an ice age. The massive amount of greenhouse gasses being pumped into the atmosphere are probably the only thing keeping the caps from growing.<br><br>At one point the ice caps were much less than today, vikings were growing crops in Greenland. The fear of global warming is absurd when you think about it. A rise in global temp means vast amounts more fresh water, more arable land, better climate for life to grow and flourish. Historically every time we have a warming period there is a massive population boom. Warming is good for people, the only real drawback is warmer temperatures mean much worse storms and unpredictable weather.","time":1493419790,"resto":123219021,"id":"6qTeG9tO","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123258696,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)18:50:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123257429\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123257429<\/a><br>Ill go bump it, happy?","time":1493419839,"resto":123219021,"id":"6qTeG9tO","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123259554,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)18:57:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123258573\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123258573<\/a><br>what about this. i read somewhere that the mayan calendar apparently goes backwards (have to look it up again, i read about it once and didnt confirm it so be sceptical about this part), as if the earth once turned into the other direction. now what if the position of the magnetic poles is dependent on the spin of the earth, or vice verca, meaning that if one shifts the other shifts too. what if the poles once were at the equator meaning the earth tilted basically 90\u00b0 to the side so that now the equator runs through the poles and while it wobbled around the direction of the spin changed as well.","time":1493420222,"resto":123219021,"id":"P2cnQlrD","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":123259562,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)18:57:05","name":"heaven","com":"<a href=\"#p123219021\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123219021<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Kc<wbr>xraxCQCd0<\/span><br>this is guy is a fucking retard. he has no concept whatsoever about how a sphere works.<br><br>latitude.<br><br>he should just kill himself.","time":1493420225,"resto":123219021,"id":"65TBNMyY","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123260678,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)19:06:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"http:\/\/callofduty.wikia.com\/wiki\/Zo<wbr>mbies_(Treyarch)\/Story<br><br>Kinda of funny cod Nazi zombies is trying to tell us something.","filename":"images(4)","ext":".jpg","w":259,"h":194,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1493420797922,"time":1493420797,"md5":"+QN1M839FkHvnyYPxPww5g==","fsize":9339,"resto":123219021,"id":"p6+l1wXG","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123261077,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)19:09:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123259562\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123259562<\/a><br>well i just saw i picked the wrong video. meant to link just to the interview<br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=iPa<wbr>MGxFUqXo<br>but yeah, the guy of the other video is an idiot that doesnt know how angles work","time":1493420988,"resto":123219021,"id":"P2cnQlrD","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":123262162,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)19:18:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123259554\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123259554<\/a><br>I didnt hear they worked in reverse.

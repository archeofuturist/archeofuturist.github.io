We know the Neo-Cons\/Neo-Libs want Assad gone and were funding the jihadis for regime change. All public knowledge of the attack indicates a false flag - unless Trump is sitting on undeniable evidence that Assad just committed suicide by using gas like a brainlet moron. HOWEVER - it&#039;s irrelevant whether it&#039;s true or not in the grand scheme of things. <br><br>And this is why: <br>1. If it wasn&#039;t a false flag he responded appropriately. All he did was bomb an airfield storing the chemical weapons - targeting aircraft and infrastructure while avoiding personnel - after warning the Russians. No Russian casualties = No WWIII. Currently conflicting reports on SAA casualties - Pentagon says none, SAA says yes one dead. Doesn&#039;t matter. By targeting the air base and not Assad&#039;s headquarters (like Libya) he demonstrated this had NOTHING to do with regime change. Just sending a message.<br><br>2. He just put Assad in check while sedating Neo-Cons like McCain, liberals who want Assad gone, and Israel (who are the people who would have supported the false flag). He&#039;s winning over support from people stonewalling him with a glorified firework show. <br><br>3. He&#039;s being tough on China and North Korea. He was meeting with the leader of China today. By pulling the trigger unannounced like this he&#039;s showing he&#039;s not fucking around with North Korea. No doubt a message to Iran as well. <br><br>4. Even if Syrian forces are grounded they still have Russian air support. Essentially nothing has changed strategically speaking.<br><br>5. The momentary salt of some of his supporters will fade as the hysteria dies down when it&#039;s seen as it is - truly nothing of significance. He gets to keep them too. <br><br>6.

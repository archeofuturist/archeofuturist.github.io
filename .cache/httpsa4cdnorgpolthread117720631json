You should thank your fucking Stars and Stripes every day that you rest securely ontop of the world&#039;s superpower, and that any attack on you would be an attack on us.","time":1490161238,"resto":117720631,"id":"HzbXwBo2","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117726368,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)01:40:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117726286\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117726286<\/a><br><a href=\"#p117726144\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117726144<\/a><br><a href=\"#p117726124\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117726124<\/a><br><a href=\"#p117725528\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117725528<\/a><br><a href=\"#p117725212\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117725212<\/a><br>PAY MUH HEALTHCARE<br>PAY MUH FOOD<br><br>YOU&#039;D WANT IT IF YOU WERE FAT TOO, RACISTS","filename":"fat-woman-pizza","ext":".webm","w":854,"h":480,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1490161245902,"time":1490161245,"md5":"KMIB06buGYwb77L7ugjSbQ==","fsize":946524,"resto":117720631,"id":"\/Ek1Cdim","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117726390,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)01:41:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117725906\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117725906<\/a><br>you never responded to my post about doctors becoming property once they receive training, faggot. you just stopped replying to people once you got backed into several corners at once.<br><br>people can&#039;t be property. you can&#039;t have a right to someone else&#039;s labour.","time":1490161262,"resto":117720631,"id":"9PfI5yHH","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":117726417,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)01:41:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117720631\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117720631<\/a><br><br>Taking money from others to fund such for others isn&#039;t &quot;freedom&quot;, anon","time":1490161281,"resto":117720631,"id":"MQavRb9T","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":117726548,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)01:43:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117726368\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117726368<\/a><br><a href=\"#p117726286\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117726286<\/a><br><a href=\"#p117726205\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117726205<\/a><br><a href=\"#p117726144\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117726144<\/a><br><a href=\"#p117726124\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117726124<\/a><br><a href=\"#p117725528\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117725528<\/a><br><a href=\"#p117725212\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117725212<\/a><br>PAY MUH HEALTHCARE SO I CAN GET HELATHY<br><br>FAT IS GENETICS, NIGGER IQ IS NOT GENETICS","filename":"1440259613243","ext":".gif","w":245,"h":226,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":115,"tim":1490161380825,"time":1490161380,"md5":"KQxKM76E1ieP3KiDzGyS3A==","fsize":1045972,"resto":117720631,"id":"\/Ek1Cdim","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117726582,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)01:43:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117720631\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117720631<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;your freedom = getting free services<\/span><br><br>Nice b8","time":1490161402,"resto":117720631,"id":"84EFrijD","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117726612,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)01:43:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117720631\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117720631<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;freedom to enslave others to provide services for you<\/span>","time":1490161420,"resto":117720631,"id":"XN6zu7UC","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":117726624,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)01:43:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117720631\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117720631<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;freedom to universal healthcare<\/span><br>WTF does that even mean?

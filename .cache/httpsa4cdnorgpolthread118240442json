Theresa May is an autistic woman with a very slim majority in parliament of 17 MPs, got parachuted into the position of prime minister without a general election and she managed to get the Article 50 bill passed unamended even though the courts, the lords and the opposition did everything in their power to try and spoil it.

Sorry but that&#039;s either sheer incompetence or not giving a fuck about his job.

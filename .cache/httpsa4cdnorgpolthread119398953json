You can&#039;t fix culture through surface level development.... Culture&#039;s roots run much deeper. It&#039;s akin to putting lipstick on a pig.<br><br>Further obstructive corrections of root cultural problems, people tend to defend their culture (even negative aspects) as if they themselves are under personal attack. There&#039;s hardly an effective way to break this beyond breaking the culture. This only occurs by assimilation+time in which they are a ((((minority)))) in a more functional and and holistic environment. What occurs slowly is that they get to see the flaws in their culture and drop them. This takes generations to sink in. <br><br>If you allow them to segment off and avoid assimilation, the root problem only festers for that much longer. There are more than enough examples of this found in immigrant dominated regions of the U.S.<br><br>A really easy and cheap solution would be to have a figurehead speak truthfully about a people&#039;s fuck ups and negative cultural aspects. Fat chance of that happening... Too much money to be made claiming economic development and $$ will solve it.<br><br>It&#039;s just life man. Eventually you see it for what it is and get over it.","time":1491264485,"resto":119398953,"id":"SZ9aS5jo","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

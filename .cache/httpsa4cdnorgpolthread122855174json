The republicans seek to cut government spending on poverty by promoting assistance available through the private sector (charities,churches,non-profits), such as by reducing taxation of these organizations, as well as reducing taxation of the poor in general. The Republican party would also want to turn federal programs over to the state, which invariably results in less government funds spent towards assisting the poor.<br><br>You guys pay attention to politics right? Do you think ive adequately described the republican&#039;s position on poverty? Is there anything else i should know?","filename":"1460608608213","ext":".jpg","w":480,"h":371,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":193,"tim":1493189130104,"time":1493189130,"md5":"Np6nwjFVnjUOwUT0W5iHpA==","fsize":90035,"resto":0,"id":"Su9qqzOC","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"as-part-of-a-class-project-i-need-to-explain-the","country_name":"United States","replies":8,"images":2,"unique_ips":6},{"no":122855338,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)02:47:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122855174\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122855174<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;such as by reducing taxation of these organizations<\/span><br><br>you mean the tax-exempt organizations you listed?","time":1493189252,"resto":122855174,"id":"sMPHsS9k","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122855449,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)02:48:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122855174\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122855174<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Asking an anonymous Cambodian shrimp harvesting board for info for a class project<\/span><br><br>You&#039;re either retarded or a shill.

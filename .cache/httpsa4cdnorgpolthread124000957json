Hear me out. What we thought was a meme war was actually just a meme battle -- and we won. This comic will reach millions of normalfag liberals and they will get one thing out of it: how antagonizing memes influence their actions. They will understand how it is that our non-pc rhetoric affects their minds and influences their behavior. Essentially, our enemies have given up on their old tactics and have used us against ourselves. They tricked us into using memes to affect reality, like they do in the name of moloch via imbuing power in celebrities and sigils, we did in the name of kek or &#039;teh lulz&#039;, or whatever (and lets be honest - 4chan isn&#039;t one person, there are as many motivations as there are users) via our memes. It backfired on them and we managed to make some big changes, or so we thought. We played right into their hands. All their efforts are going towards using our memes as the vaccine to the mind viruses we create. As quickly as we gained power and influence we will lose it. By the end of the year the left will be completely immune to all of our tactics leaving us completely powerless against our greatest foe. The worst part is that there is nothing we can do about it at this point. We&#039;ve been completely defeated; its checkmate. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;inb4 shart in the mart<\/span>","filename":"shart","ext":".png","w":612,"h":464,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":189,"tim":1493863004938,"time":1493863004,"md5":"N3G9ByuUEio7YgMncp8ntQ==","fsize":39471,"resto":0,"id":"ihfBIJrI","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"after-reading-this-and-reflecting-upon-the","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":124001675,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)22:03:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124000957\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124000957<\/a><br>the comic literally had nothing to do with your stupid post and fuck you for making me read a billion panels of faggotry and information that everyone already knows<br>I hate you and want to pound forks through your skull","time":1493863391,"resto":124000957,"id":"uZcEJOmP","country":"JP","country_name":"Japan"},{"no":124001877,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)22:05:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124001675\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124001675<\/a><br>you have been defeated","time":1493863502,"resto":124000957,"id":"NiOMMtqG","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

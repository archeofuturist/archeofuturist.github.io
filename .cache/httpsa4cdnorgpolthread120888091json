Once they divorced, the court in Pierce County determined what would happen with the children<br><br>\u201cWhen the court issued the parenting plan, it gave primary custody of the children to their father and gave our client very limited time with their kids after being a stay-at-home mother most of their lives,\u201d said David Ward, Rachelle\u2019s attorney. <br><br>The Washington state Supreme Court decision determined that the \u201ctrial court failed to remain neutral regarding Rachelle&#039;s sexual orientation and impermissibly favored Charles&#039; religious beliefs.\u201d<br><br>\u201cWhat was most shocking to us in our parenting plan was that it included restriction on our client\u2019s ability to discuss religion, homosexuality, or alternative lifestyle concepts with her kids. I haven\u2019t see that kind of provision in a parenting plan in Washington state in 20 years,\u201d said Ward. \u201cHaving those restrictions in a parent\u2019s plan shows there\u2019s a suspicion toward a gay parent that their children should view them as being different, that it\u2019s even taboo for a parent to discuss her life with her kids.\u201d<br><br>The case now goes back to a new judge in Pierce County where the court has to determine a new parenting plan.","filename":"rainbowpepe","ext":".jpg","w":400,"h":247,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":154,"tim":1492072946200,"time":1492072946,"md5":"DdEQhLbvrIQEyv+uvM68sg==","fsize":11622,"resto":0,"id":"uYmydn2q","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"lesbian-mother-permitted-to-discuss-sexuality","country_name":"United States","replies":22,"images":2,"unique_ips":13},{"no":120888219,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)04:44:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"So what?<br> Why shouldn&#039;t she be able to discuss whatever the fuck she wants with her own fucking kids?","time":1492073088,"resto":120888091,"id":"Q3VFGeV2","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120888383,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)04:47:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120888219\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120888219<\/a><br>It&#039;s brainwashing, indoctrination.

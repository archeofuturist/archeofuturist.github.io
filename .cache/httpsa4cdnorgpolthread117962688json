They also tend to make decisions based on emotion, rather than on rational thinking, way more than Asians.In the course of history there have been various cases where whites dealt with their problems in a way that was \u201cdecent\u201d instead of in the way that was the most effective.<br>Examples of this are:<br>\u2022 In Australia, they wanted to get rid of the aborigines. They could have easily exterminated them, instead they chose to separate abbo children from their people and let them breed with whites over and over until their genes were \u201cerased\u201d.<br>\u2022 In America, they abolished slavery and then instead of sending the slaves back to Africa or exterminating them, the simply freed them.<br>\u2022 Americans gave the Indians reservations, instead of just chasing them away or exterminating them.<br>\u2022 Hitler (arguably) let the English escape at Dunkirk. He also (allegedly) expelled the Jews first instead of just exterminating them from the beginning. <br>This \u201cempathy\u201d might have come from the fact that Europeans used to hunt using animals like wolfs\/dogs and developed agriculture (using animals) earlier than most other races. Therefore the tribes that were more empathetic towards their animals, kept them in better condition and would consequently have more food. So empathy became an instinct for Europeans.<br>I believe \u201cempathy\u201d is a fundamental flaw of the white race and will cause its ultimate demise. White people are a living example of the saying &quot;No good deed goes unpunished&quot;.<br><br>Source: <br>https:\/\/heartiste.wordpress.com\/201<wbr>5\/07\/01\/dangerous-science-clues-tha<wbr>t-empathic-ability-varies-by-race\/<br><br>Previous thread: <a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/117509306#p117509306\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117509306<\/a>","filename":"2008_Jared_Taylor","ext":".jpg","w":220,"h":254,"tn_w":216,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490293120161,"time":1490293120,"md5":"lLKTgSqfZ483mWr9x8BB2A==","fsize":15394,"resto":0,"id":"zU1zGN5L","country":"BE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-white-mans-empathy","country_name":"Belgium","replies":85,"images":21,"unique_ips":34},{"no":117962732,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)14:18:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"Also related to this:<br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=n2g<wbr>oCMKjwuE (In this vid JT talks about the imagination\/illusions of the white man as a weakness.)<br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Gmq<wbr>P2uGk35E (in the vid, around 22:54, Murdoch Murdoch makes a reference to this too)<br>I also believe this will be very hard to change.

Outbreeding favors altruistic behaviors that benefit the community as a whole, and leads to populations that are more civic-minded. Inbreeding does the opposite. The church outlawed inbreeding in parts of Europe hundreds of years ago, which changed the populations. This explains why areas inhabited by populations with a long history of outbreeding have less corrupt governments, and why the opposite is true for areas with a history of inbreeding. <br>See the hajnal line link in this post<br><a href=\"#p117967001\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117967001<\/a>","time":1490295664,"resto":117962688,"id":"v3vVHgJj","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117968068,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)15:01:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117962688\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117962688<\/a><br>Yes goy, white people are empathic (brainwashed) they dont hurt others...

I had actually thought about this exact thing yesterday after hearing about average IQs of different nations and racial biology. Whites seemed to be a balanced class, but what do they excel in? Every race has something. I came to the conclusion of empathy. I almost immediately randomly stumbled on the JT video where the guy he&#039;s talking to came to the conclusion of abstraction, but I think he is wrong. I think it&#039;s empathy. Now this thread is created. I think we are on to something here. <br><br> Lately I&#039;ve had a very real and almost a genetic\/biological need for malevolence. Not because I browse \/pol\/ and study race realism or anything, though that has a part in it. It was mainly working with people at my new job (I&#039;ve always done grave security and was typically alone) and realizing how retarded people are in the real world. I&#039;ve discussed this with a friend of mine who seemed to be an expert on being an asshole and he enlightened me to the fact that people expect you to be nice and bend over for them. I came to the conclusion that the *only* reason people do this is to play on empathy to get what they want out of you. Look at any black on the street who has asked you for change equipped with a sob story. <br><br> I wonder if these feelings in me arise from some deep genetic memory.

There is enough unhappiness in this world without me adding to it. Life isn&#039;t all about me; I have created a family and children and I have a responsibility to them that I could never forsake. So over time, even when feeling same-sex attraction, I have chosen not to dwell on it and to remain faithful to my marriage and family. I draw immense satisfaction from that.<br><br>I don\u2019t think of myself according to my sexuality or sexual desires, but rather as a man, husband, and father. I\u2019ve formed many relationships that support that self-understanding and I\u2019m content with it. I suspect that there are many married men like me with these same-sex attractions but who choose to remain faithful to our first commitment to wife and family. It\u2019s no big deal to. Really. In fact, it\u2019s the greatest of honors and privileges.","filename":"gaytrump2","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":576,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1490668876803,"time":1490668876,"md5":"BqSx9Mg7dSys90HFxkoB3g==","fsize":96936,"resto":0,"id":"u7vo5kWl","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"does-pol-think-gay-men-should-marry-women","country_name":"United States","replies":4,"images":1,"unique_ips":5},{"no":118600530,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)22:44:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118600110\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118600110<\/a><br>bump","time":1490669088,"resto":118600110,"id":"GOQ5SDyA","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118600823,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)22:48:05","name":"Mike &quot;Deus Volt&quot; Pence","com":"<a href=\"#p118600110\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118600110<\/a><br><a href=\"#p118600530\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118600530<\/a><br>No, sage<br>this is a slide thread","time":1490669285,"resto":118600110,"id":"wKbqj7wV","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118601208,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)22:51:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118600110\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118600110<\/a><br>I don\u00b4t care what gays do but think that everyone who does is a faggot.","time":1490669502,"resto":118600110,"id":"SZcXNfBi","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":118601503,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)22:54:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118600110\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118600110<\/a><br>A lot of us aren&#039;t bigots who don&#039;t give 2 shits about gays<br>We care about gay shit being pushed on us straight people<br>The law is the law <br>Please ......REEEEEEEEEE","filename":"4b6","ext":".jpg","w":400,"h":343,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":107,"tim":1490669666296,"time":1490669666,"md5":"2jZVqQzvQmekdLcIwkEusA==","fsize":8045,"resto":118600110,"id":"9aZqTcd5","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

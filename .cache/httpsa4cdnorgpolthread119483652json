He destroyed four planes before he was ultimately shot down over North Vietnam. Many people have asserted that he was responsible for the disaster aboard the USS Forestal due to a stupid mistake he is alleged to have made that cost millions of dollars and hundreds of lives of fellow sailors.<br><br>Any ordinary pilot would have been grounded after destroying four aircraft but John was not ordinary.<br><br>His father was the Admiral of the 7th fleet and this gave McCain the opportunity to continue his bumbling.<br><br>He was shot down during a bombing run in Vietnam. Apparently on the first pass McCain ineptly missed his target zone and decided to make a second run. The NVA gunners were ready for him.<br><br>Upon bailing out he did not follow proceedure and hold his arms properly which resulted in injury upon ejection which afflicted him the rest of his life. He is alleged to have been very cooperative with his captors who nicked named him &quot;Songbird&quot;.<br><br>His wife became disabled while he was a POW. Upon return to the USA McCain abandoned her for a young woman who&#039;s father was a wealthy beer distributor in the Phoenix area. The father-in law has been long rumored to have had connections to organized crime. McCain then embarked upon his political career.<br><br>After being elected to office McCain narrowly avoided being caught up in an FBI sting called &quot;Arabscam&quot; where fake sheiks offered cash to crooked politicians. Later he became embroiled in the &quot;Keating Five&quot; he was one of those investigated for taking favors or money from a banker named Keating for favorable legislation and support.<br><br>Again, no smoking gun was found so he was able to continue his career as a politician.<br><br>Yes, John McCain is a real special kind of guy.

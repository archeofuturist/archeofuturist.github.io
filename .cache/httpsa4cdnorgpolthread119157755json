Everyone I pick up or interact with is white and happy. I have never had one experience in the area where it was unpleasant or they were rude, etc. I think it&#039;s because aside from visitors from outside the city, I have never really seen a black person in Newport Beach. Mexicans and a few other brownies for sure, but unless I&#039;ve been extremely lucky, I think I can safely assume they don&#039;t live in Newport Beach. It&#039;s also made it one of my favorite cities to go to since everyone there is just....well, overwhelmingly happy. People smile towards each other when walking down the streets, they&#039;re courteous, kind, not to mention they tip rather well. <br><br>I guess what I&#039;m saying is, I think I may have stumbled where I&#039;d like to retire.","filename":"1453357324356","ext":".jpg","w":550,"h":414,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":188,"tim":1491031159158,"time":1491031159,"md5":"fgXMQQO4dSIEMRDNH2bOsA==","fsize":17659,"resto":0,"id":"A0snMArw","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"an-example-of-a-nearly-perfect-city","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

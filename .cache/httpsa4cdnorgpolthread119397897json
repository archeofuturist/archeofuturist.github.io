The protagonists are almost never asian in appearance, even though the creators of the game are Japanese. Tons of blonde people in their games. Why is this? Is there a &quot;white&quot; obsession in Japan? And the list goes on and on.....<br><br>Mario, Princess Peach<br><br>Link (he is an elf or something, but still looks white, Zelda is certainly white)<br><br>Samus<br><br>MANY of the Final Fantasy Characters== total white boys<br><br>Solid Snake (I know, he is half Japanese, half American or somethiing, but he looks white), almost all the other MGS characters are white<br><br>Devil May Cry dude<br><br>Almost ALL of the Resident Evil Characters (in fact, most Capcom games are full of whites)<br><br>Castlevania dudes<br><br>Many many more that I am not thinking about right now......<br><br>Seriously, other than a couple JRPG characters, the Street Fighter folks, and Ryu Hyabusa, I am having trouble coming up with Japanese protagonists in Japanese games.","filename":"Regional_5ba63c_1417056","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":970,"tn_w":154,"tn_h":249,"tim":1491262206822,"time":1491262206,"md5":"pkDHZgEHrqT1Q41o9tQHJg==","fsize":162836,"resto":0,"id":"s9MoZiEa","country":"AT","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"it-really-doesnt-make-sense-to-me-japanese-games","country_name":"Austria","replies":4,"images":2,"unique_ips":5},{"no":119398117,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)19:31:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"White people are the most beautiful race.

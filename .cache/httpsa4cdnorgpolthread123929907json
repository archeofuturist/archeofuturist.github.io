The Church Dogmatically Opposed the New Science: In reality, the Church was the leading sponsor of the new science and Galileo himself was funded by the church.

This was the view of the greatest astronomer of the age, Tyco Brahe. The Church&#039;s view of heliocentrism was hardly a dogmatic one. When Cardinal Bellarmine met with Galileo he said, &quot;While experience tells us plainly that the earth is standing still, if there were a real proof that the sun is in the center of the universe\u2026and that the sun goes not go round the earth but the earth round the sun, then we should have to proceed with great circumspection in explaining passages of scripture which appear to teach the contrary, and rather admit that we did not understand them than declare an opinion to be false which is proved to be true.

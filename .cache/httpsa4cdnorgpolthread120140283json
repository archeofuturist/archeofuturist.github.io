Militarily and culturally speaking, Egypt was weak.

Maybe that explains why it was such a rich city. Or maybe that was just because it sat on the crossroads of several trade routes.<br><br>Funnily enough, it was this wealth that prevented Roman conquest for years. The Romans knew that any pro-consul in charge of Egypt would immediately become wealthy enough to become a dictator.","time":1491664399,"resto":120140283,"id":"LSnV4A6R","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":120143823,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)11:33:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120141215\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120141215<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;70 years<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;long<\/span>","time":1491665627,"resto":120140283,"id":"7hG2pjVF","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

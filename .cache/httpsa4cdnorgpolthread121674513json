Excerpts from the Chronicle stated, &quot;The Klansmen assembled at their headquarters and marched . . . to Monroe avenue and proceeded to the colored church where they conducted services outside the church and presented the pastor of the church with an envelope containing a donation of money for the benefit of the church. This was said to be above $100. The color guard led the parade, and they were followed by a band.&quot; This is not the only account of the Klan donating money to a Kenilworth African-American church. <br><br>Leila Hartshorn (1911-2010), an icon in Kenilworth&#039;s African-American community, came to Kenilworth in 1921. In 2004 she stated, &quot;I remember the Klan. They used to have parades in Kenilworth. We had no problems with them. We knew who some of them were but didn&#039;t say anything. They were actually very good to some of the Black families.&quot;<br>http:\/\/www.nj.com\/suburbannews\/inde<wbr>x.ssf\/2015\/06\/remembering_when_the_<wbr>ku_klux_k.html<br><br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ku_Kl<wbr>ux_Klan_recruitment#Charity_work_an<wbr>d_recruitment<br> In 1922, the Klan \u201ccontributed $25 each to the Volunteers of America and to the African Methodist Episcopal Church, an offer which Webster said proved that the Klan was not anti-black\u201d.","time":1492516214,"resto":121674513,"id":"zudcdEpy","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":121675603,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)07:52:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"Is the klan man doing a hand sign with his two knuckles sticking out?","time":1492516349,"resto":121674513,"id":"yQbaNkhH","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"}]}

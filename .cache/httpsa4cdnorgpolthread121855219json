Has something happened? Some anon claimed traffic was down 20%, are the shills \/ bots gone? (There is a normal amount of shitposting, of course.) Usual shill and slide threads would be:<br><br>- bait threads (threads that offend you and make you reply like &quot;how can X compete&quot; &quot;x btfo&quot; &quot;is X redpilled&quot; etc.)<br>- heavy bait threads (threads that are downright so annoying you want to punch the OP like &quot;*kills baby* my body, my choice sweetie :)&quot;)<br>- slide threads (threads that distract from ongoing political events with &quot;what happens here?&quot; &quot;can we save women?&quot; etc.)<br>- drumpf threads (threads that offend Trump voters to involve them in debates without real topics like &quot;I regret my vote so much!!&quot;)<br>- \/b\/-tier &amp; \/x\/-tier threads (sometimes the other boards post here because it is the most active, &quot;flat earth&quot;, &quot;give advice on X&quot; etc.)<br>- emigration threads \/ posts (threads that suggest \/pol\/ is shit or dead and that people should start leaving it)<br>- LARP threads (threads that pretend that something is happening like &quot;REALLY HAPPENING WW3 NOW!!&quot; or &quot;I am an FBI insider, AMA.&quot;)<br>- over-the-top conspiracy posting (anons that spam pictures of random handsigns, vague connections with no info behind)<br>- defeatist posting (anons that claim that believing we can save the board is naive and that you should just give up and leave)<br><br>Atm all of these are down...

So, I believe most prosperous communities will be those that don&#039;t allow degenerates such as the ones you describe, which will force parents, in their own self-interest, to care for their children if they don&#039;t want to live like gypsies in the outlaw parts of the country, totally isolated from civilization.","time":1490957335,"resto":119042468,"id":"nDcYhV1a","country":"MT","country_name":"Malta"},{"no":119045508,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)06:54:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119043914\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119043914<\/a><br>Missed your post.<br><br>I&#039;m a libertarian, I believe education should be localised, powered by technology and similar to homeschooling except with actual experts, perhaps with some family element (taught by your uncles and aunts), although that isn&#039;t purely left wing so I can&#039;t larp with that.<br><br>To solve the poverty problem, people simply don&#039;t collect the communal education fund from poorer families.

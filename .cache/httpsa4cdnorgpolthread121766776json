There are some very high functioning people with Down Syndrome whose quality of life is at least as high, and possibly higher than, many able bodied people.<br><a href=\"#p121774710\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121774710<\/a><br>(1) Your point as to the Nestle CEO&#039;s defence of his outrageous statement<br>It&#039;s simply not an argument, it&#039;s an opinion. In his opinion things are misused when people think they&#039;re entitled to its use. An argument would connect the explanation (rights) to the consequence (misuse). Here&#039;s a contrary example plucked from the ether - most people including myself believe they have a negative right to free speech. Most people including myself do not misuse that right (to harrass or defame or intimidate) because they have an awareness that abuse of that right can attract positive penalties, such as lower social standing or violent reaction from the subject of the misuse or legal consequences if the jurisdiction in question has laws about this sort of thing. In the case of misusing resource entitlements, firstly, use of private water usually costs money, secondly, where it&#039;s public water most jurisdictions apply criminal overlays to its use, and finally, most people have an awareness of scarcity in the first place. So the description of it as a human right is entirely accurate, because it should be a human right, and moving away from that in the interests of the profit motive are evil.<br><br>(2) Your point as to murder being the utilitarian solution to overpopulation<br>What makes murder wrong for utilitarians is that it frustrates the interests of people in continuing to exist. That frustration diminishes utility. Your arms-length judgment as to whether the life quality of third parties would recoup the utility lost by murdering unwilling victims is implausible, because while some people might consider it acceptable to live in a poorly functioning economy, almost no one would consider it acceptable to be killed.","time":1492565016,"resto":121766776,"id":"CctepoKo","country":"AU","trip":"!W1MmioNU0A","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":121777536,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)21:23:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121766776\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121766776<\/a><br>just make amniocentesis mandatory and most of the Downs cases that are detected will be aborted anyway","filename":"1465648611843","ext":".gif","w":728,"h":720,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":123,"tim":1492565031004,"time":1492565031,"md5":"2sf6jAHG8bEeHNPtMz0QDg==","fsize":563123,"resto":121766776,"id":"ABoMvmhg","country":"IS","country_name":"Iceland"},{"no":121777611,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)21:24:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121766776\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121766776<\/a><br>It&#039;s not your decision,unless it&#039;s your tard.","time":1492565062,"resto":121766776,"id":"MsiwZFdA","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121777866,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)21:25:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"Somebody needs to post the tard cat girl thing.","time":1492565159,"resto":121766776,"id":"MsiwZFdA","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121778291,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)21:28:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121777866\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121777866<\/a><br>Nvr mind","filename":"image","ext":".jpg","w":168,"h":168,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492565320303,"time":1492565320,"md5":"A1dbOvmYUl8xzc3r7\/mcRQ==","fsize":19315,"resto":121766776,"id":"MsiwZFdA","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121778685,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)21:31:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121768570\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121768570<\/a><br>This.","time":1492565496,"resto":121766776,"id":"6BUvbx\/Z","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121778871,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)21:33:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121766776\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121766776<\/a><br>because they&#039;re not an epidemic like migrants.","time":1492565582,"resto":121766776,"id":"eLA9LsbW","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":121779249,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)21:35:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121778291\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121778291<\/a><br>Too small, can&#039;t read text","time":1492565729,"resto":121766776,"id":"rdgBN13D","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121779273,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)21:35:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121777484\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121777484<\/a><br>1) I wasn&#039;t necessarily defending his statement, mainly saying that we should rethink how we classify and use water, a finite resource. <br><br>2) Murder depends on your definition of life.

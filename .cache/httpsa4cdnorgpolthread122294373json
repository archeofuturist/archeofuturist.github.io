But if people are really going to be that picky, then I would just let them know that only members of the legislative branch (Congress) can actually introduce legislation. The President can not, since he is the Executive Branch. Having another member of congress introduce this was the only way it could happen. <br><br>Frankly, I am just happy it&#039;s getting more attention, but these have been shot down before. That&#039;s why it&#039;s important to talk about it, put pressure on our representatives.<br><br>And on the 5th point for rule of law, best you could really give it is that there is still extreme vetting. Which personally I think is fine for the moment, but if there is a terror attack, the blood is on democrats hands.<br><br>All in all I think Trump has done alright. Id vote for him again now based on current information, but I still have 4 years for that decisions to solidify or not.<br><br>Also MAGA","filename":"1491594405464","ext":".jpg","w":1392,"h":1016,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":91,"tim":1492879994712,"time":1492879994,"md5":"sWvmh916geCURjX14T7S1A==","fsize":187793,"resto":122294373,"id":"D4VXLbdG","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":122299375,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)13:08:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122294373\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122294373<\/a><br>I didn&#039;t vote for Trump, but now I do support him.

If all opposed to the existing political situation collaborated there&#039;s a chance some may get a political system they like, it would be uncertain but less than 0%, even if it didn&#039;t go your way at least you wouldn&#039;t be living like live stock.","time":1491729789,"resto":120257210,"id":"IP\/P0+Ex","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":120263645,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)05:28:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120259136\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120259136<\/a><br>Antifa are traitors.

That claim is that Russia colluded with Trump to influence the election. On that front there has been absolutely no evidence.

If you see those phrases associated with any sort of story, you should take it with a grain of salt. If every single time a story is mentioned those words are littered throughout the article, you should disregard it. If I wrote 10 articles a day talking about how you allegedly maybe might look at about 20 dicks or so, would that qualify as hard evidence that you are a male prostitute? Because that is what the media is hoping to accomplish here. They hope that if they write enough stories about alleged, so-called, potential, maybe, evidence of trump potentially, maybe, potentially, meeting with someone who may be, potentially, could be, associated with Russia then that qualifies as evidence that Trump and Russia colluded.","time":1491325105,"resto":119487471,"id":"tx5Aw\/2l","country":"US","country_name":"United

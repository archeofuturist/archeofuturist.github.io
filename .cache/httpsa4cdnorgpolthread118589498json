They had multiple opportunities to fire-bomb the entire British Island wiping out their factories and more importantly their workers. They didn&#039;t because they wanted to LARP and because they felt that doing something like that was beneath their so called values of: masculinity, strength, and efficacy. They avoided slaughtering all 300,000 Brits at Dunkirk where they could have ended the war. They didn&#039;t force all of the French men into fighting for the Germans, while at the same time raping the women into total submission. Again, typical white male weakness. <br><br>You can whine about your values all you like. The right have been total losers throughout most of history, and most especially during the last 100 years.

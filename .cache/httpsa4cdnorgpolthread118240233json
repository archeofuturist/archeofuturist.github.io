Here&#039;s the official blame apportionment for this bill failing:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;PAUL RYAN: 50%<\/span><br>He had 7 years to figure something out. He brushed aside concerns that he had no plan. He concocted the plan in secret with Wall Street and insurance company cronies, and managed to develop something even worse than Obamacare. He then tried to frame it as a &quot;binary decision&quot; to conservatives, and only offered amendments rather than major changes.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Freedom Caucus: 10%<\/span><br>Many rejected the bill outright, and never changed their minds. Others tried to work with it, to their credit, but ended up abandoning it when it was clear that Ryan wanted Obamacare 2.0. They at least tried to put something together, and were open to working with all cooperative parties. Even though they constituted the deciding &quot;No&quot; votes, they were part of the process.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Democraps: 20%<\/span><br>At least the Freedom Caucus tried to get something working. At least they showed up for the debate. Democrats just sat on their hands, flailing and calling Trump Hitler. What the fuck do we pay these people for? They should all be kicked out for their current obstructionist posture (yes, R&#039;s should have been kicked out when they were obstructionist too). Democrats are a joke, so glad I left that dumpster fire.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Trump: 20%<\/span><br>He tried, it can&#039;t be said that his full support wasn&#039;t behind it, but Ryan&#039;s starting position was so toxic, and the negotiation process was so one-sided, that he couldn&#039;t make it work.<br><br>So yes, this is a loss for Trump. But it&#039;s mostly a loss for Ryan, who has shown that he has no idea how to get a piece of legislation passed. If you know that you need a faction&#039;s support to get a bill passed, get them together as you&#039;re writing the bill, not after everything&#039;s set in stone.","filename":"41b3e3c1ba8717d15013acde6dea8844[2]","ext":".jpg","w":700,"h":948,"tn_w":92,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490466831595,"time":1490466831,"md5":"UP4oeYIqizv64Pei8BmL3A==","fsize":118037,"resto":118240233,"id":"a6YoHkuK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118254681,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)14:33:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"Think of this situation properly.<br>Trump is accused of being a closet fascist\/nazi constantly by the left.<br>So let&#039;s say they are correct.

Reality is that insurance companies don&#039;t pay enough procedures and doctor(hospital) has to wait for next payment of insurance companies before they can take new customers, which is why there are wait lines. Second problem are intermediary businessmen who are totally unnecessary, since if you want to have universal healthcare, then country should know what they need and how much of it, we don&#039;t need intermediary people to tell us and decide prices and bargain with. It should be totally illegal for intermediary people if they exist to even decide the prices, but hey nothing is perfect, so limit them at least so they don&#039;t overblow the costs.","time":1490469599,"resto":118240233,"id":"MmuviSd0","country":"SI","country_name":"Slovenia"},{"no":118260190,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)15:21:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118259645\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118259645<\/a><br>You didn&#039;t say anything addressing what was said aside from you not liking it&#039;s tone.","time":1490469705,"resto":118240233,"id":"G18pj8IY","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118260194,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)15:21:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118259701\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118259701<\/a><br>You&#039;re arguing from a point where I need to PROVE to you that the right isn&#039;t evil, which is retarded, because no half of the polticial spectrum is inherently bad\/evil\/oppressive.<br><br>Your arguments aren&#039;t arguments, they&#039;re pointing the finger and playing victim.","time":1490469707,"resto":118240233,"id":"ZH1gAWND","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118260263,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)15:22:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118259993\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118259993<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;There is no lack of doctors Finland<\/span><br>Their wages wouldn&#039;t be so high if there weren&#039;t lack of them, my communist friend.","time":1490469741,"resto":118240233,"id":"U4AdaFEh","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":118260272,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)15:22:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118259303\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118259303<\/a><br>Lasting approximately six hours, the German ground campaign against Denmark was one of the shortest military operations of the Second World War","time":1490469745,"resto":118240233,"id":"FKTH5dPh","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118260401,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)15:23:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118260194\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118260194<\/a><br>Still nothing.","time":1490469810,"resto":118240233,"id":"G18pj8IY","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118260546,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)15:24:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118255246\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118255246<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;If we taxed the rich heavily, and reinvested that money into non-entitlement programs alone, like infrastructure<\/span><br>They&#039;d leave the country, Bernie<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Republicans actively shun the idea of taxing the rich<\/span><br>Just plain false, not even accurate historically speaking.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Not just taxes them more, but taxing them even a fraction of the percentages that blue collar workers pay.<\/span><br>The rich pay more in taxes, because their taxes are a percentage of their income, which is more than the working man&#039;s<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;they love taking money from the poor<\/span><br>Again, false and just one of those &quot;dude socialism&quot; lies.","time":1490469887,"resto":118240233,"id":"ZH1gAWND","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118260588,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)15:25:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118240233\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118240233<\/a><br>His neck is so long if you hung him his feet would touch the ground.","time":1490469910,"resto":118240233,"id":"Kk3CIErA","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118260648,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)15:25:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118260401\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118260401<\/a><br><a href=\"#p118260546\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118260546<\/a><br>Here you go, faggot, it took me 10 seconds.

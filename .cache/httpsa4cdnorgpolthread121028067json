Don&#039;t do it. Ever. <br>Smoke weed green by itself. It can even undo the damage that smoking tobacco has done to your lungs. <br>If you wanna be even safer just learn how to make hemp oil and either get high on it or cook with it. It&#039;s natures medicine. <br>Try and do productive things like write or make music or meditate. You can find other great uses for it depending on what you&#039;re like. <br>Just don&#039;t smoke tobacco or cigarettes.

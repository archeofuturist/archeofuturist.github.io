Cannabis only causes the development of mental illness (schizophrenia being the main one) in people who were already going to develop it anyway. Basically they just develop it earlier. On top of this, there is a correlation vs causation thing going on here as many people try cannabis for the first time in their late teens or early 20s; the same time that schizophrenia begins to develop.","time":1492156420,"resto":121028067,"id":"vqbSeuyf","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121034937,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)03:54:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121034594\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121034594<\/a><br>Stop buying weed","filename":"1491688743812","ext":".jpg","w":528,"h":792,"tn_w":83,"tn_h":124,"tim":1492156461654,"time":1492156461,"md5":"NPL1VIfmvCNowjIFzRWZzg==","fsize":67199,"resto":121028067,"id":"4803mi2S","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121034983,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)03:54:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121034847\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121034847<\/a><br>So hallucinogenic but not a hallucinogen.

They always just say &quot;That&#039;s stupid.&quot; or the &quot;We shouldn&#039;t have to be.&quot; or just scoff at the idea. Liberal, mainly liberal women, act like sex is like their periods. It has to happen and it&#039;s unreasonable to expect them to not do it if they can&#039;t afford it.<br><br>What exactly is wrong with personal responsibility? I don&#039;t understand the liberal&#039;s side of the argument, it just seems like &quot;We want it so it should just be that way.&quot; They always gloss over having personal responsibility.","filename":"1492787044748","ext":".png","w":1600,"h":1200,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1493243520386,"time":1493243520,"md5":"w6hwGZ3vzNW8ROoJWc0chw==","fsize":1260765,"resto":0,"id":"wIAf\/TNe","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"every-time-theres-a-discussion-about-taxpayers","country_name":"United States","replies":4,"images":1,"unique_ips":5},{"no":122945402,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)17:53:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122945236\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122945236<\/a><br>fucking bigot<br><br>its THEIR body not YOURS<br><br>when will YOU learn to understand this?","time":1493243593,"resto":122945236,"id":"NZ9TTJQn","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122945602,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)17:54:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"The purpose is to shit all over your values and assert a dominance over you.","time":1493243666,"resto":122945236,"id":"\/2OhNEWC","country":"DK","country_name":"Denmark"},{"no":122946047,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)17:57:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122945236\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122945236<\/a><br>Lack of personal responsibility seems to be a common millennial problem.

Sure, social liberalism is a thing but it seems there&#039;s a unanimous consensus belief in free trade, relative economic liberalism and globalism, etc. Even most Left-leaning or Far-Left European parties like SYRIZA seem in favor of the EU, which is a massive pro-free trade capitalist organization. Why is this?<br><br>What happened to the Old Left? It fought for workers and for actual structural changes to help people, like labor reform and things like Georgist value land tax reform to counter inequality rather than minor tax increases in a system too complicated to follow and easy to break.","filename":"HenryGeorge","ext":".jpg","w":1117,"h":1526,"tn_w":182,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493551182167,"time":1493551182,"md5":"\/ZdrStRBbpS7r9NKAqeL6Q==","fsize":292889,"resto":0,"id":"rSU1\/e4H","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"is-the-true-left-dead","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":123468196,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)07:22:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123468060\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123468060<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;what is Antifa<\/span>","time":1493551326,"resto":123468060,"id":"hovMnzI4","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123469064,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)07:35:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123468196\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123468196<\/a><br>Weren&#039;t they freaking out over Brexit? They seem to fully support the idea of the EU and don&#039;t seem particularly opposed to liberal market capitalism on the whole no matter how much larping they do.

I think it&#039;s stupid that they want independence, they would be more powerful unified with England and Wales. Some scots claim to want independence because they feel that they are oppressed by the U.K. However, that era is long over and the Scots now have more power. Also this argument is flawed since the Scots are very powerful within the U.K. The Scottish Gaelic and Scots languages, which once separated the English and Scottish peoples, are near extinct, so it&#039;s stupid that people want to revive this dead horse.","time":1491332568,"resto":119500635,"id":"d\/gQpZtn","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

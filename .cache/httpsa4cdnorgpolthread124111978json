Bring back company towns for example. Could be big tax breaks for companies that open up shop in small towns and get people to move there from the small cities. Rediversify the populous across the landscape. Also policies to break up big farms might be smart like what Canada does with the quota system.","time":1493933909,"resto":124111978,"id":"pJ5oxRRA","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":124114543,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)17:38:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124114080\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124114080<\/a><br>Because the non-whites always vote left.<br><br>Chicken and egg situation m80.","time":1493933939,"resto":124111978,"id":"BduyFSlQ","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":124115232,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)17:44:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124114080\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124114080<\/a><br>Non-whites are too stupid to organize successful revolts.","time":1493934269,"resto":124111978,"id":"JdwwvYnZ","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]}

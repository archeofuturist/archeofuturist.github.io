Our goal is to promote european identity, which is both racial and cultural. We want to offer a new way of being patriots, one that can&#039;t be shamed with the usual buzzwords and won&#039;t scare regular people. We&#039;re not nat-socs, we&#039;re not fascists, we&#039;re not skinheads. We&#039;re Europeans and proud.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What politics do you promote?<\/span><br>To each people, its homeland. Multicultural societies are a failure, Europe is for Europeans and non-Europeans will have to be remigrated back to their countries. Globalisation is also a problem, as we don&#039;t want our culture to become americanized, though we have nothing against Americans. We are against immigration, islamisation and globalism, because they&#039;re all threats to our people and our way of life.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What do you actually do?<\/span><br>We&#039;re like a right-wing Greenpeace, and we&#039;re really good at happenings and getting media attention. Agit-prop, leaflets, protests, building occupations, creating white communities, carrying on our traditions... We occupied a mosquee in Poitiers (some here may better know about the battle of Tours), we clamb on the BrandenburgerTor, we deployed a large banderole over Vienna&#039;s turkish embassy to say fuck off to Erdogan and his Turks... many other things I could talk about.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Are you pro-Trump? Pro-Putin? Pro-Israel?<\/span><br>We&#039;re pro Europe and pro white. We&#039;re vassals to no one, and nobody own us.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I\u2019m non-white\/non-European, can I join?<\/span><br>No. This is a European organization, and that means being white and living in Europe. Impossible to open chapters overseas because that would be in conflict with the ideology we\u2019re pushing. Still, we believe whites from everywhere are brothers.","filename":"13416779_899147683529894_2278173689386828510_o","ext":".jpg","w":1200,"h":800,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1490642163641,"time":1490642163,"md5":"8GhAZiR7LI4HiXANMZqZ5Q==","fsize":153953,"resto":0,"id":"tgg6SrPc","country":"BE","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"gnration-identitaire-identitre-bewegung-general","country_name":"Belgium","replies":225,"images":60,"unique_ips":67,"tail_size":50},{"no":118548332,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)15:17:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;I\u2019m non-white\/non-European, can I join?<\/span><br>No. This is a European organization, and that means being white and living in Europe.

This is the true diversity we want to present. Same roots, same people, same homeland, mostly same interests, yet we\u2019re all unique.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Then, are you regionalists?<\/span><br>Neither.

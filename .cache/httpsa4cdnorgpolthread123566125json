Such as LSD improving creativity, caffeine giving you some needed energy, alcohol helping social cohesion. Don&#039;t particularly see how it is feminine, it&#039;s not submissive to take drugs for your own experience. You are not raising a kid on it. If you see as it trying to climb social ladders or as submissive due to peer pressure that is your choice doesn&#039;t make it correct. <br>I will agree that there are a lot of hardcore drugs that definitely shouldn&#039;t be available. But if you are willing to enforce your view onto people with the threat of death, you should be executed with the commies. Also trannies are a problem due to shit parenting, social marxism and mental problem.

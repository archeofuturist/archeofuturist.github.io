Now this one is the group best known as &quot;Wahhabis&quot; - yet they are the opposite of what you would expect. For example, Madkhali Salafis in Egypt support Sisi against the MB and jihadi Salafis; Madkhalis in Benghazi also support Hafter against the same. &quot;Wahhabis&quot; as traditionally defined shill for whomever is in power, if it&#039;s someone who enables them like the Saudi king, or someone who merely tolerates them like the Egyptian leader, it&#039;s the same to them. My cousins who praise Rabee&#039; al Madkhali (their namesake cleric), hate the rebels in Syria for example considering them deviants for instigating mutiny against the government.

Groups like Jaysh al Yarmouk are nonideological, kind of like Fatah. Then you have groups like the Free Idlib Army, which is somehow in the middle between non-Islamists and the MB influenced cadre. Then you have Ajnad al Sham (the Ghouta one not Hama), which represents the popular Sufi tariqa of Jamaat Zaid in the Ghouta. Then you have Faylaq al Sham, which is a traditional grouping of MB influenced FSA Islamists. Then you have Jabhat al Asala, which is widely reported to be a Saudi backed quietist Salafi group - aka Madkhalis. Now this one is the group best known as &quot;Wahhabis&quot; - yet they are the opposite of what you would expect. For example, Madkhali Salafis in Egypt support Sisi against the MB and jihadi Salafis; Madkhalis in Benghazi also support Hafter against the same. &quot;Wahhabis&quot; as traditionally defined shill for whomever is in power, if it&#039;s someone who enables them like the Saudi king, or someone who merely tolerates them like the Egyptian leader, it&#039;s the same to them. My cousins who praise Rabee&#039; al Madkhali (their namesake cleric), hate the rebels in Syria for example considering them deviants for instigating mutiny against the government. Then you have groups like Jaysh al Islam and Ahrar al Sham, which are more revolutionary Salafi types - dubbed &quot;Sururis&quot;.

Now this one is the group best known as &quot;Wahhabis&quot; - yet they are the opposite of what you would expect. For example, Madkhali Salafis in Egypt support Sisi against the MB and jihadi Salafis; Madkhalis in Benghazi also support Hafter against the same. &quot;Wahhabis&quot; as traditionally defined shill for whomever is in power, if it&#039;s someone who enables them like the Saudi king, or someone who merely tolerates them like the Egyptian leader, it&#039;s the same to them. My cousins who praise Rabee&#039; al Madkhali (their namesake cleric), hate the rebels in Syria for example considering them deviants for instigating mutiny against the government.

Groups like Jaysh al Yarmouk are nonideological, kind of like Fatah. Then you have groups like the Free Idlib Army, which is somehow in the middle between non-Islamists and the MB influenced cadre. Then you have Ajnad al Sham (the Ghouta one not Hama), which represents the popular Sufi tariqa of Jamaat Zaid in the Ghouta. Then you have Faylaq al Sham, which is a traditional grouping of MB influenced FSA Islamists. Then you have Jabhat al Asala, which is widely reported to be a Saudi backed quietist Salafi group - aka Madkhalis. Now this one is the group best known as &quot;Wahhabis&quot; - yet they are the opposite of what you would expect. For example, Madkhali Salafis in Egypt support Sisi against the MB and jihadi Salafis; Madkhalis in Benghazi also support Hafter against the same. &quot;Wahhabis&quot; as traditionally defined shill for whomever is in power, if it&#039;s someone who enables them like the Saudi king, or someone who merely tolerates them like the Egyptian leader, it&#039;s the same to them. My cousins who praise Rabee&#039; al Madkhali (their namesake cleric), hate the rebels in Syria for example considering them deviants for instigating mutiny against the government. Then you have groups like Jaysh al Islam and Ahrar al Sham, which are more revolutionary Salafi types - dubbed &quot;Sururis&quot;. Finally you have AQ and ISIS, which are considered as Salafi jihadis - these guys consider Wahhabis to be infidels, along with everybody else who disagrees with them.<br><br>My preferred outcome?

and blocks of buildings which were infiltrated by terrorists north of Jobar.<br><br>In a statement, the General command said that army units, in cooperation with the supporting forces, reclaimed all points and the blocks of buildings that had been infiltrated by terrorists from Jabhat al-Nusra and groups affiliated to it in the factories area in the northern part of Jobar neighborhood at the eastern outskirts of Damascus.<br><br>The statement said that army units are still pursuing the remnants of the fleeing terrorists in the depths of Jobar, while engineering units are dismantling and removing explosive devices and bombs planted by terrorists in the area.<br><br>The General Command pointed out that during the past 48 hours, the factories area north of Jobar has become a graveyard for successive waves of terrorists in which hundreds of them were killed, adding that the success of the Syrian Armed Forces in crushing the successive waves of terrorists in the factories area confirms the terrorists\u2019 foolishness on one hand, and the insistence of their operators and sponsors to use them as fuel and push them to suicide to serve their agendas and goals on the other hand.<br><br>The General Command concluded its statement by renewing its pledge to the Syrian people to remain the bastion that protects Syria, reaffirming its determination to continue the war on terrorism until it is eliminated and until security and stability are restored to the entirety of the Syrian Arab Republic.","time":1490470049,"resto":118239853,"id":"7IntsNAx","country":"ZA","country_name":"South Africa"},{"no":118260952,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)15:28:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"Also I think im

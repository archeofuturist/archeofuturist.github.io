Ever since the 1920s they&#039;ve had a history of being very secular. They don&#039;t speak Arabic, they drink alcohol, and they don&#039;t submit to the ridiculous laws of that sand nigger death cult.<br><br>At least that&#039;s what I thought. But now I&#039;m seeing more and more how they support ISIS, how tons of them are extremely radicalized, how they&#039;re calling for more and more immigrants to pour into Europe and convert it.<br><br>Any roaches here that can explain? Have Turks always been like this or did something change in the past couple of years to make them abandon their secular traditions?","filename":"1475453596128","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":539,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":210,"tim":1492742443210,"time":1492742443,"md5":"dJy7DOSijqiUKDybVjL94w==","fsize":82171,"resto":0,"id":"pBdrxr8f","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"what-the-fuck-happened-to-turkey","country_name":"United States","replies":4,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":122084368,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)22:44:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122083882\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122083882<\/a><br>Well time to read again !<br>Not every parts of turkey are liberal.

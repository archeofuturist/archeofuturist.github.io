My original plan was to get into tax, but I am starting to think this whole &quot;ABOLISH THE IRS, TAX REFORM NOW, SIMPLIFY THE TAX CODE!&quot; meme is going to come to fruition during my career. Obviously, this would be devastating to any tax accountant. Without the government trying to fuck people over in taxes, my sole purpose would vanish. Do you guys think this is a valid concern? Would audit be a better in the long run? Thanks.<br><br>*This is politically related because uit involves the discussion of the future of the tax code.","filename":"62643_camythbusters_02f","ext":".jpg","w":960,"h":1194,"tn_w":201,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493225976209,"time":1493225976,"md5":"yivBQCeHaOkxnKqMDDHPWw==","fsize":231348,"resto":0,"id":"km8bgnOo","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"hello-friends","country_name":"United States","replies":5,"images":0,"unique_ips":5},{"no":122906610,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)13:01:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122906422\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122906422<\/a><br>Accounting will always be necessary. <br><br>If society literally crumbles accounting will be irrelevant but then so will money; you&#039;ll probably be more concerned about bread or whatever. <br><br>Next","time":1493226076,"resto":122906422,"id":"2UrxhLBj","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122906844,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)13:03:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122906610\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122906610<\/a><br>You don&#039;t understand public accounting","time":1493226211,"resto":122906422,"id":"km8bgnOo","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122908671,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)13:20:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"Both of my parents are accountants. Very lucrative field. Definitely go private sector for a job. Great benefits, great salary, and by the time you retire you could be making upwards of $300,000 a year.

You are virtually guaranteed a job as an accountant. Even if you cant get work doing peoples&#039; taxes every company will always need bookkeeping. For the same reason it&#039;s also an excellent way to get your foot in the door with ANY company. Just because you start as an accountant doesn&#039;t mean you cant move into management for example.<br><br>if you think trump is going to have any meaningful impact on anything, you need to leave \/pol\/ for a bit and realize that he&#039;s just a dumb orange faggot who will have virtually no influence on your career, income, etc. this board is just filled with NEET trumpcucks who desperately need some kind of meaning in their lives so they obsess over him.","time":1493227391,"resto":122906422,"id":"Vf8uix2g","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122909658,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)13:28:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122906422\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122906422<\/a><br>Be sure to network while you are in college.

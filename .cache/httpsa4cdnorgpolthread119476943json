The North Korean Nuclear Program is at an unknown efficiency at the moment. And what happens to the people who live there? Will they need a place to stay once pyongyang is destroyed? These are good questions. I personally live on the west coast, which Kim Jong-Un has threatened to nuke at least twice. I plan on enlisting soon and i dont wont to die because some stupid gook has a tiny dick and has to compensate for it. So i think the best thing we can do is wait them out for now.

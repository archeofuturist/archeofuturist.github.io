The Russians on the other hand spammed a bunch of fake stories. The Russians never actually hacked the election, they hacked the DNC and revealed that Bernie was getting pushed out of the election by Clinton. Of course, the Russians seem to be taken all the credit for the election going into Trumps hands by the mainstream media. I mean, Russia likely did contribute, but I don&#039;t think it&#039;s really as much as people say because I&#039;ve met more Trump supporters in California than I have met Clinton supporters easy and that&#039;s a blue state.<br><br>Basically, there is no proof, and while it&#039;s obvious that the Russians have influenced Trump&#039;s picks, it should not really be surprising considering the massive amounts of data that got hacked in Obama&#039;s second term. Likely, the Russians and China have classified information on nearly every US personnel that has ever existed. I would not even be surprised if that was just the beginning of the rabbit hole.<br><br>http:\/\/www.usatoday.com\/story\/money<wbr>\/personalfinance\/2016\/10\/02\/how-pro<wbr>tect-your-social-security-number-af<wbr>ter-hac\/91350266\/<br><br>http:\/\/fortune.com\/2016\/02\/10\/irs-h<wbr>ack-refunds\/<br><br>http:\/\/www.usatoday.com\/story\/tech\/<wbr>news\/2016\/12\/30\/report-russia-penet<wbr>rated-us-electrical-grid\/96022986\/<br><br>http:\/\/nypost.com\/2017\/02\/14\/nearly<wbr>-200000-face-pure-chaos-after-calif<wbr>ornia-dam-breach\/<br><br>I don&#039;t even think that is most of the hacks that actually occurred.

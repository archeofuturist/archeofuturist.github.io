I like the romantic idea of segregation, with main ethnicity being the supreme for its country and nation, but don&#039;t agree with stupid shit like gasing kikes and creating an &quot;aryan&quot; image. I also support nationalism (tourism is still possible, though) and having working class jobs for &quot;foreign&quot; ethnicities (mixed ones also), with top qualified jobs made only for main ethnicities.

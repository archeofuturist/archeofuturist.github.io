I like the romantic idea of segregation, with main ethnicity being the supreme for its country and nation, but don&#039;t agree with stupid shit like gasing kikes and creating an &quot;aryan&quot; image. I also support nationalism (tourism is still possible, though) and having working class jobs for &quot;foreign&quot; ethnicities (mixed ones also), with top qualified jobs made only for main ethnicities. Does that have something to do with fascism?<br>Btw, usa is already fucked, the only thing they could achieve is a race war, which is fucking retarded.","filename":"image","ext":".jpg","w":200,"h":296,"tn_w":168,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490660618052,"time":1490660618,"md5":"F+jDRlyB1i17EvXWeTM8SQ==","fsize":24428,"resto":0,"id":"t5aCFK5f","country":"CZ","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"fascism-idea","country_name":"Czech Republic","replies":15,"images":1,"unique_ips":6},{"no":118585366,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)20:27:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"Bump","time":1490660850,"resto":118584999,"id":"t5aCFK5f","country":"CZ","country_name":"Czech Republic"},{"no":118585560,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)20:29:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118584999\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118584999<\/a><br>Corporate Syndicalism and Military Citizenship. <br>I do not really think that Fascism is synonymous with genocide, maybe just very forceful and violent exodus.<br><br>Your idea is very &quot;meh&quot;, or interpretation is, at least.

Because we&#039;re all equal in dignity and equally deserving of a dignified life, with a dignified life being composed of righteousness, security, a modicum of luxury, and control over our own destiny. Why? There is no why, other than a petulant &quot;because we are!&quot; It&#039;s just something I assume. Can I prove it? No. But I believe it. It is my core belief.

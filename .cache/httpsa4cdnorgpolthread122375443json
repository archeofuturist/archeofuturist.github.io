The point I&#039;m trying to make is the relatively uneducated view of Theresa May as the &#039;fuck immigrants&#039; candidate, even though she really isn&#039;t, is how people see her. I really, desperately hope that she&#039;ll understand this and become it, but the reason she&#039;s polling so high is because the common man is viewing brexit as &#039;fuck refugees\/immigrants&#039; and Jeremy Corbyn as &#039;lol more refugees\/immigrants please\/whatever I don&#039;t care&#039;. <br><br>People who have lived in this fucking country since the 60&#039;s are seeing what has happened and don&#039;t like it one bit. My dad in the 90&#039;s wouldn&#039;t dream of voting Conservative, but here now in 2017 where immigration is perhaps the biggest issue this country faces, it&#039;s a big fucking deal.","filename":"fat bitch","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":1024,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492923168539,"time":1492923168,"md5":"AGg9BYnqsD0Y0Jm0oUp98Q==","fsize":309034,"resto":122375443,"id":"OkpEgWr2","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122382178,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)00:54:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122381979\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122381979<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mrs may is good<\/span><br>No she isn&#039;t<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;why isn&#039;t she<\/span><br>X Y Z <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;where did I say she was good?!<\/span><br><br>wat","time":1492923297,"resto":122375443,"id":"iaQwR5Cv","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122382186,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)00:55:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"Have you ever been to a pub with a boat as the bar? you probably haven&#039;t, I have.","filename":"IMAGE","ext":".jpg","w":1012,"h":570,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1492923301974,"time":1492923301,"md5":"RV6zpLTbh0I0PpJbKpefwg==","fsize":237342,"resto":122375443,"id":"6SeyGMsT","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":122382295,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)00:56:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122381193\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122381193<\/a><br>I think we could have done a lot worse than May, but if you think she&#039;s going to do anything about immigration you&#039;re possibly mad.<br><br>I live in the north too.<br>I loathe labour for their complete abandonment of the people they were supposed to represent.<br><br>But May only gets backing as the lesser of two evils and an attempt to kill labour in the hope it wakes the fuck up and either changes or dies, not because she&#039;s anti-immigration.","time":1492923382,"resto":122375443,"id":"9OSsNUHL","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122382445,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)00:58:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122382186\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122382186<\/a><br>A lot of our bars our made of decommission wood from ships of the Royal Navy.","filename":"cdr_chs_020616kingshead","ext":".jpg","w":615,"h":409,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1492923488469,"time":1492923488,"md5":"N+K8ofaQe2Rb0BmRMhtJFw==","fsize":62490,"resto":122375443,"id":"iaQwR5Cv","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122382579,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)00:59:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122382445\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122382445<\/a><br><br>That isn&#039;t quite the same thing though, is it?","time":1492923569,"resto":122375443,"id":"6SeyGMsT","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":122382722,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)01:01:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122382178\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122382178<\/a><br>Nice shitpost.<br><br>Perhaps try to understand that even to piss poor people, someone saying &#039;meritocracy now&#039; isn&#039;t a bad thing unless you truly are a subhuman piece of shit who plans to work as a shelf stacker your entire life.<br><br><a href=\"#p122382295\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122382295<\/a><br>Again, I agree with you.<br><br>I wish UKIP were still headed by a strong candidate like Nigel, but the fact of the matter is they aren&#039;t.

This year, several thousand American families will suffer the Price is Right effect. Next year, it will be tens of thousands. You will be witnesses.<br><br>The Price Is Right effect happens when a family, anywhere between &quot;not destitute&quot; and &quot;not rich,&quot; so lower working to upper middle class, includes a family member of ownership status over the family&#039;s assets who becomes terminally ill. Cancer, COPD, stroke complications, surgery complications, whatever.<br><br>The family member will cling to life. Probably for a (completely predictable) period of between 2 and 10 weeks. Doctors know these intervals very well, with high degrees of confidence and accuracy. The family will either hear outright, or intuit, that it&#039;s over for gramma. Or grampa. Or mom, whomever. The doctor will, by ethical duty and economic self-interest (notice), describe the course of last-resort treatment available to the soon-to-be-deceased, and the family will agree to every last bit of it, plus demand that anything above and beyond that also be done.<br><br>So the patient will be made complicit in bankrupting the family and all of its assets in exchange for watching six more weeks of The Price Is Right on their ever-dimming hospital room TV, and end up dying anyway.<br><br>Since demographics tell us there are more white-hairs alive now in the US than ever, we can add the Price Is Right effect to the forces powering the death spiral. It is inevitable.","filename":"DeathSpiral","ext":".jpg","w":624,"h":632,"tn_w":123,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490461891726,"time":1490461891,"md5":"n\/STqo2NEGoM8NHNrBPZLw==","fsize":51605,"resto":118245482,"id":"vgHMErp8","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118245686,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)13:11:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"\/wsg\/thread\/1598220#p1598761\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;&gt;\/wsg\/1598761<\/a><br>Top fucking kek","time":1490461895,"resto":118245482,"id":"4F5Jt7Xj","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118245687,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)13:11:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118245566\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118245566<\/a><br>people assume the general right wing culture that appears on other boards is a direct raid from us instead of a more general changing tide.","time":1490461896,"resto":118245482,"id":"is6N68B5","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118245697,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)13:11:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/118241655#p118245469\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118245469<\/a><br>That&#039;s the biggest problem of them all.

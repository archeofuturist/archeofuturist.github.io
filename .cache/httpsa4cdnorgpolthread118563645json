I graduated from a fairly wealthy suburban high school and most of the white kids went to college, a few joined the military and a few started working shitty hourly jobs. That&#039;s all we were qualified to do. A bunch of kids these days, including myself, go to college because they think they have to. If their families can pay for it ok, but many get student loans for shitty degrees and fuck the rest of their lives up. I think that we are creating a generation of permanent children unequipped for adult life.

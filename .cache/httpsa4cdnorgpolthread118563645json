We have basically no mexicans in Finland so it&#039;s impossible for us to harvest our crops. The grain and produce just rots in the fields, since we only have a few hundred asylum seekers in the country illegally that we can use to harvest the produce. I haven&#039;t eaten in two weeks.","filename":"1415254410831","ext":".png","w":1280,"h":800,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":78,"tim":1490652544671,"time":1490652544,"md5":"HP\/RY\/0m0MSyyeO+eqDbTg==","fsize":87645,"resto":118563645,"id":"P\/K+XpBz","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":118569749,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)18:11:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118563645\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118563645<\/a><br><br>So robots can replace complicated manufacturing undertaken by Rust Belt Retatrds but not basic agriculture undertaken by illiterate border hoppers?","time":1490652691,"resto":118563645,"id":"AgRcp6Bk","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":118569750,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)18:11:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118568910\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118568910<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;all our crops would wither and we&#039;d literally starve<\/span>","filename":"123","ext":".webm","w":720,"h":404,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1490652692167,"time":1490652692,"md5":"\/OzVhQSCVc8o9NmqKCmwkg==","fsize":646982,"resto":118563645,"id":"E7Piv9dU","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118570042,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)18:13:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118568484\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118568484<\/a><br>Thanks, it&#039;s an idea I&#039;ve been kicking around for a while now. I graduated from a fairly wealthy suburban high school and most of the white kids went to college, a few joined the military and a few started working shitty hourly jobs. That&#039;s all we were qualified to do. A bunch of kids these days, including myself, go to college because they think they have to. If their families can pay for it ok, but many get student loans for shitty degrees and fuck the rest of their lives up. I think that we are creating a generation of permanent children unequipped for adult life. We&#039;ll see what happens when all the boomers retire and the millennial with gender studies degrees have to quit Starbucks and get real jobs to fill the gaps.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;implying millenials will work<\/span>","time":1490652831,"resto":118563645,"id":"CQFCqufk","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

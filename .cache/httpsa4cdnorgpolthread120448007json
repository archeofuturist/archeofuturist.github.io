I had to shut it down, as much as it pained me to do so. This is a 99% white school too, so there wasn&#039;t even any black people around to hear it.<br><br>Is this just an example of teenage edginess and rebellion or is more at play here?","filename":"tmp_14758-1491746309398690192338","ext":".gif","w":286,"h":400,"tn_w":178,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491837665760,"time":1491837665,"md5":"FT0NbaKWVW4t8RvQpjPCQA==","fsize":2057037,"resto":0,"id":"attem\/em","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"are-kids-our-hope","country_name":"Canada","replies":4,"images":0,"unique_ips":4},{"no":120448658,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)11:27:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120448007\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120448007<\/a><br>\/pol\/ is an example of teenage edginess","time":1491838021,"resto":120448007,"id":"MV4GPD4n","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120448921,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)11:29:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120448007\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120448007<\/a><br>How many are jooz?","time":1491838163,"resto":120448007,"id":"6m4G8F1e","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":120449142,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)11:31:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120448007\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120448007<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;hurrr guys, I heard a bunch of immature pre-teens make an edgy joke today. does that mean western civilization is saved??<\/span><br>you are a retard m8","time":1491838294,"resto":120448007,"id":"bRToW5T9","country":"TH","country_name":"Thailand"},{"no":120450430,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)11:43:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120448658\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120448658<\/a><br>I guess you&#039;re right about that.<br><a href=\"#p120448921\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120448921<\/a><br>Not many.<br><a href=\"#p120449142\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120449142<\/a><br>Don&#039;t put words in my mouth, you Siamese fool.

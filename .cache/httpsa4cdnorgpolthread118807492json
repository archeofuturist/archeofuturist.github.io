I see it everyday, the lack of care, the mindlessness and the chill.<br>You see the issue with the redpill isn&#039;t just opening your eyes, it is having to constantly choose truth and logic over feelings, even heartbreaking ones. The we\u00f1fare state breeds weakness. When you know you don&#039;t have to work in order to have access to healthcare, you worry less about having to work. When you know you and your family will be provided by the state, you worry less about needing work. When you know having a child out of wedlock doesn&#039;t matter, for the state will provide, you care less about whoring around. When you know the state will give you back your savings, you care less about falling into economic trickery. When you know you have a net underneath, you care less about falling. Welfare is that net. Welfare is what keeps people from working hard, from knowing their priorities, their duties; because they know, they know they dont have to fight in order to survive.","time":1490808957,"resto":118807492,"id":"ixMdca\/E","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":118810142,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)13:41:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"bump","time":1490809264,"resto":118807492,"id":"jMk6r26S","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":118810549,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)13:44:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118807492\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118807492<\/a><br><br>it&#039;s true, really. life is so easy, so painless, that people can&#039;t think it&#039;s real, so they start to hallucinate. discipline is how we deal with hard times, and so, there&#039;s really no reason at all to be disciplined. but, of course... we&#039;ll make hard times come again by being idiots, and then we&#039;ll re-learn truth and discipline. only when it&#039;s finally necessary.","time":1490809488,"resto":118807492,"id":"TOLM8xjU","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118810581,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)13:45:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118808046\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118808046<\/a><br>No m80, we are the apex predator, but we&#039;ve domesticated ourselves.

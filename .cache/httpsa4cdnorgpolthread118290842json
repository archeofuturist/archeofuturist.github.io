Ireland earned her Freedom through bloodshed same as the Americans. I say YES to a United Ireland! Does &quot;Northern&quot; Ireland wnat to remain the hairy ball sack of England? England is just trying to hold on to its former glory of being the once great British Empire that fell apart after America won it&#039;s independence. We never submit to them and be part of their so called &quot;union&quot; and live free under your own flag. Not even the Great Roman Empire could conquer Ireland so why is England still holding you by the pubes? As the old saying goes, &quot;The sun never sets on the British Empire&quot; and I say to you, nn July 4 1776 the sun set over American Soil and a colony revolted and won and defeated the &quot;Great&quot; British Empire. Now Ireland, the choice is yours. Will the sun set over Britain or will it be setting behind Free Irish mountains? Be Free Irenald!

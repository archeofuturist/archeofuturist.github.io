England is just trying to hold on to its former glory of being the once great British Empire that fell apart after America won it&#039;s independence.

Not even the Great Roman Empire could conquer Ireland so why is England still holding you by the pubes? As the old saying goes, &quot;The sun never sets on the British Empire&quot; and I say to you, nn July 4 1776 the sun set over American Soil and a colony revolted and won and defeated the &quot;Great&quot; British Empire.

Via his widely influential writings and lectures, Haeckel elaborated a holistic view of man&#039;s symbiotic relationship with the natural world. To Haeckel, and those who followed his philosophy of &quot;Monism&quot;, natural laws governed the workings of the natural worldandhuman civilization alike.

Nations, cultures, and peoples could therefore be categorized &quot;scientifically&quot; into those that were superior and those that were inferior, with the latter being considered expendable and even worthy of destruction.

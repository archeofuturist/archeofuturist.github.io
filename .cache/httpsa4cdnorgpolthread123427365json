The story of Creation is far more realistic according to human nature and also according to the nature of the world as I see it. I know that many Catholics have embraced Intelligent Design and are able to fit evolution into the Scripture, and I did the same for a very long time, but I now believe it is folly.

Far more in keeping with all that I have seen. And it requires no more mental gymnastics and silly attempts to fit Scripture into the world and argue by the standards of the very men who lie about everything else.

He is not like them in description, proscription, or nature. His worship was never like theirs, and neither were his laws. Once we have determined this, we know that we are not dealing with &quot;every single notion of divine &#039;other&#039;&quot; but of something completely different. Any work you do to eliminate the belief in those things is not anti-Christian but rather was begun and is continued by the Christians, for we know those for what they are: either the fancies of flawed men, or literal demons who have tricked their human slaves. <br><br>Then we must look at the nature of God and at the nature of His works. And very soon, if we are being honest and open-minded (one would think this should be easy for &quot;scientists&quot;) then we will necessarily come to the conclusion that He exists as described. Now that we know this, we know that Scripture cannot be man-made but must, in fact, be Divinely Inspired and Inerrant.","time":1493523073,"resto":123427365,"id":"Q8PXXdXi","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

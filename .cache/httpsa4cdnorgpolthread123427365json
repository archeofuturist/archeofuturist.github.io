The story of Creation is far more realistic according to human nature and also according to the nature of the world as I see it.

He is not like them in description, proscription, or nature. His worship was never like theirs, and neither were his laws. Once we have determined this, we know that we are not dealing with &quot;every single notion of divine &#039;other&#039;&quot; but of something completely different.

And very soon, if we are being honest and open-minded (one would think this should be easy for &quot;scientists&quot;) then we will necessarily come to the conclusion that He exists as described.

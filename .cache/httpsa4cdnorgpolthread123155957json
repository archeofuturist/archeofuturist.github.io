I see this misconception time and time again. The left acting the way they are today will always be worse than someone eating propaganda on the right, not thst the person you are replying too is, but the reason why is because the right has not been the group that historically advocates for free speech, open mindedness, equality, etc etc. The left is. They have gone against everything they have championed and still claim to champion (not that they really did it back then either). They are the biggest hypocrites of the 21st century if not the 20th as well. For this reason as long as they keep acting how they act, a leftist fag will always be worse than a right winger no matter how blinded by politics they are.

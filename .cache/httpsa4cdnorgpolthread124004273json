We voted for him because he represents a &quot;testing of the waters&quot; presidency. Whatever happens, this will be exposed:<br><br>1. The Leftists, RINO&#039;s, deep-state, Leftist conspiracy (The swamp)<br>2. If he was genuinly sincere (he seems to be) <br>3. And what power he actually has as a sincere president, meaning that he should make America BETTER at the least. (think 8 years please)<br><br>It&#039;s win-win. Everything about Trump getting in is a victory for us because if it goes wrong, everything gets exposed. Massive NEW red-pills are happening for us who are already red-pilled because of the people surrounding Trump. The evil is being exposed.<br> <br>My point is that if he has no power, or he&#039;s not genuine, or whatever, WE LEARN TO NOT TRUST PRESIDENTS. We become revolution-minded.<br><br>Trump didn&#039;t (or doesn&#039;t want to believe) that the EVIL is so deep-rooted, but it is. Now he knows how powerful and anti-American the swamp is, but he has ally&#039;s not just enemies. He is doing a really good job for a NEW president and non-politician. <br><br>We have won an amazing victory electing him. The SJW&#039;s, antifa, and the deep-state are being exposed, while you nay-sayers only look at the negatives. Regular people are now getting red-pilled regularly. It was always about the progressives, but now it&#039;s about nationalism. The seeds have been planted and people are awake.<br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=p8M<wbr>2tg2RkIQ&amp;index=127&amp;list=PL4BA0B584F<wbr>D592733","filename":"images.duckduckgo.com","ext":".jpg","w":1180,"h":842,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":178,"tim":1493864762079,"time":1493864762,"md5":"ycnVg+wEl9jbjyem8srz9Q==","fsize":558906,"resto":0,"id":"11O7Nany","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"wtf-is-wrong-with-pol","country_name":"United States","replies":10,"images":2,"unique_ips":5},{"no":124004562,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)22:28:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124004273\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124004273<\/a><br>We all are still behind him.

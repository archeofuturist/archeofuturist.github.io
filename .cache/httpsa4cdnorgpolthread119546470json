GMI is not UBI. GMI is indeed a bad idea, but im going to assume you are talking about UBI instead since thats all \/pol\/ ever talks about.<br><br>2. People already get supported via welfare. The welfare programs create people more dependant on the government than UBI would, since to get welfare, you need to be approved by the government, meet specific criteria, feel endangered of losing your welfare if you do a little bit better, and the various programs become a political point which would encourage you to vote for people who promise to fund them.<br>UBI on the other hand is just a reverse tax. Everyone gets it, its more efficient because it can just be rolled in as part of the tax system, all those welfare programs vanish. Because its something as straightforward and &#039;guarenteed&#039; as taxes, its not some special government program to influince voters, but just a normal fact of live in a modern society. This eliminates the gamishness of welfare and makes one feel free to attempt to gain.<br><br>Essentially, the argument against all these &#039;but wont gibsmedats result in societal colapse!&#039; is to point out that the dats are already being gibed, this is just a way to change the method which will make the hand full of people who would try to do better have an easier time of doing that. There will certainly be people who just sit there are leech, but those people are already doing that.<br><br>I believe in UBI even with out the need for it as an automation response, just as a welfare replacement. But on the subject of automation, automation is not about eliminating a fixed number of jobs, it eliminates a PERCENTAGE of jobs, and that percent will grow. If you just gas all the people with out jobs, then the number of people that exist will be less, and fewer people will now need to work. That creates a death spiral to extinction. The fact is we need some sort of system in the future where most people do not need to work, or society will collapse entirely.","time":1491364108,"resto":119546470,"id":"8KYwxO\/H","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119563415,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)23:55:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119561437\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119561437<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;a GMI seems very likely to significantly increase the NEET population.<\/span><br><br>A UBI would change the nature of the lowest level of work.

The result is that people would be gaining work experience.

Its not so much money but assurance that you will be ok.

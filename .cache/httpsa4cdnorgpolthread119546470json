I can&#039;t see how this doesn&#039;t end up resolving into ghettos, forced sterilization, and death camps over the long run. <br><br>People bring this up as the &quot;obvious&quot; solution for automation \/ machine AI outsourcing which will &quot;permanently&quot; put people out of work. So the logic goes. <br><br>So, I put 60% of populace on GMI, other 40% works. Not sure why the 40% bothers to show up for work, but hey, maybe it&#039;s super fulfilling. The 60% are just taking up dead space, eating, shitting, and breeding. You want all the losers together, to minimize cost, so new Ghettos in out of way places. You don&#039;t want them breeding more, so sterilization. Even then... at some point, wouldn&#039;t any rational government say &quot;hey, these people are non-productive and a waste of resources&quot; and just gas them all as a cost savings? <br><br>What am I missing?

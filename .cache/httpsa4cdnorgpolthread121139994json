Perfectly planned despite Trump&#039;s busy schedule he knew this shit could not be taken lightly. <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Trump gives an aggressive, and firm handshake. Xi already knew this would happen and responded back in the same manner.

Shit actually gets done. Trump makes reasonable offers, instead of senselessly bickering like the nigger. Doesn&#039;t go all the way, and didn&#039;t bargain for too much. Again, this man is a genius at bargaining. <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The two parties have dinner. Trump&#039;s granddaughters sing to the Chinese president in Chinese. Xi is impressed that Trump gives a shit about China and Chinese culture. <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The two president&#039;s wives also meet and discuss silly women shit.

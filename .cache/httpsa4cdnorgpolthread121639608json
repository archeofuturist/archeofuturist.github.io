We know women are evoluntionarily conditioned to seek attention and protection from a dominant male figure right?<br><br>Well, back in the old days, the average girl would have grown up surrounded by alpha males who were mentally and physically far superior to her, all her life. This is because only men received education while girls didn&#039;t, and physical activity was a male-only thing. So a pre-modern girl would have lived her entire life surrounded by the kind of male figures who would have satisfied her subconscious need for a &#039;master&#039; to protect and guide her.<br><br>But it&#039;s different in the modern age. Nowadays little girls go to school just as boys do, and since the female body matures much faster than boys pre-puberty they are actually physically superior to the boys they see around them. This causes pre-pubescent girls to develop a perverted idea of the relationship between sexes that runs counter to their evolutionary nature.<br><br>Then shit hits the fan when the boys reach puberty. In just a couple of years, the wimpish little boys that used to get bullied by the girls turn into young adults. The teenager girls, who lived their entire lives seeing girls equal or greater to boys in stature, are suddenly presented with a terrifying and foreign environment where they are surrounded by hairy muscled &#039;men&#039; many times stronger than them, who behave completely differently to the boys of yesterday (hitting on girls, trying to be macho etc). This causes them to experience a huge congnitive dissonance.<br><br>Although this comes as a shock to all teenage girls, most girls adjust to the changes, accept their evolutionary nature, correct their view of the sexes and become mature females; the ones who fail to accept that the power dynamic beween man and woman has changed and hold onto their infantile state of mind become feminist.","filename":"maxresdefault","ext":".jpg","w":1920,"h":1080,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1492490698651,"time":1492490698,"md5":"iGBbwRmm7OAZ659qqc+Xmg==","fsize":110935,"resto":0,"id":"jqmQjnbW","country":"KR","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"what-feminists-really-are","country_name":"South Korea","replies":6,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":121639979,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)00:48:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121639608\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121639608<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;physical activity was a male-only thing<\/span><br>90% of people for most of history were subsistence farmers, which usually meant that women were quite physical.","time":1492490899,"resto":121639608,"id":"pva01xxG","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121640227,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)00:50:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121639608\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121639608<\/a><br><br>Feminists only exist because western civilization gives them all the abilities to exist.

If you eat junk food shit only and are not able to make at least three pasta, three rice and three potato based meals you are part of the problem. <br><br>It is really easy, I&#039;d not say I&#039;m talented but I still don&#039;t even need recipes. Everybody can make a salad, some marinated chicken and rice. Everybody can make pasta, some tuna and onions \/ garlic. Everbody can make a simple potato casserole with ground meat and potatoes. <br><br>IT IS SIMPLE.<br><br>This stuff is so much healthier for you, won&#039;t make you as fat and you will get rid of your addiction for refined sugars. <br><br>Again: Don&#039;t even talk about resisting porn when you are still eating junk food. This shit is fucking up your life big time.<br><br>Also: Cooking has class and is a skill a good man should have. Keep women out of the kitchen. Cooking is a man&#039;s job (see: best chefs in the world are male).","filename":"4576tehth","ext":".jpg","w":578,"h":499,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":215,"tim":1493707434831,"time":1493707434,"md5":"KpCti1Xs3qzuGMCy9agZiQ==","fsize":57835,"resto":0,"id":"vMovrv0w","country":"DE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"if-you-cant-cook-you-are-degenerate","country_name":"Germany","replies":14,"images":0,"unique_ips":12},{"no":123741698,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)03:25:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"If you don&#039;t grow as much of your own food as possible you&#039;re degenerate.<br><br>If you have an apartment grow something on your balcony. <br><br>If you have a house spend a weekend digging up a veggie patch. <br><br>Buy a small goat.","time":1493709950,"resto":123738597,"id":"3OqRWWw5","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":123742312,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)03:34:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123738597\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123738597<\/a><br><a href=\"#p123741698\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123741698<\/a><br>fucking plebbit spacing, go fuck your selfs you damn niggers <br>also<br>i can cook and bake, king of the kitchen right here, i grow my own vegetables i work out <br><br>nigger im everything you wish you&#039;d be now go fuck your self and crawl back where ever you came from <br> <br>if you don&#039;t watch Gordon ramseys YT channel you&#039;re a low life cunt","time":1493710488,"resto":123738597,"id":"fpReksoQ","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":123742506,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)03:37:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123738597\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123738597<\/a><br>Cooking is a woman&#039;s job","time":1493710679,"resto":123738597,"id":"BXxUC7CB","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123742749,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)03:42:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123741698\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123741698<\/a><br>Goats are very useless animals fucktard","time":1493710920,"resto":123738597,"id":"qlP4eSO1","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":123742830,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)03:43:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123742312\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123742312<\/a><br>Grow your own fruits, ahmed.","time":1493710983,"resto":123738597,"id":"xHR6VCDL","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123743018,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)03:45:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123742506\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123742506<\/a><br>Woman should not do tasks that involve doing something with passion and creativity.<br>Most of them are only good at following rules and doing as told.<br><br>If they follow the recipe fine, but I prefer a little uniqueness in each meal.","time":1493711141,"resto":123738597,"id":"vMovrv0w","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":123743497,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)03:52:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123738597\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123738597<\/a><br>I make italian sandwiches, roast beef sandwiches, spaghetti and meatballs, chicken broccoli and rice bowls with different flavors (curry, kung pow, orange, or sesame) breakfast (pancakes, hashbrowns, eggs, turkey bacon and turkey sausage, toast)<br><br>A thick protein shake every day with frozen fruit, spinach, yogurt, and almond milk.<br><br>Maybe a bowl of cereal or some veggie chips for a snack throughout the day.

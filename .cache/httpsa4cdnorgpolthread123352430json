There was nothing glorious about sinking the Belgrano because the Argentine Navy was largely made up of under-privileged poor and working class men who got drafted.","time":1493487318,"resto":123352430,"id":"ZiCaWUMf","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123356666,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)13:35:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123356520\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123356520<\/a><br>RONSON!<br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=8_L<wbr>cH-Lwlxs","filename":"THE THAL SPY","ext":".gif","w":585,"h":432,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":92,"tim":1493487332758,"time":1493487332,"md5":"zJ000Gxemj3I3KHRewhl2A==","fsize":2367575,"resto":123352430,"id":"VKzjupLi","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123356679,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)13:35:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"Funny, isn&#039;t it?

For instance, to a construct like \u201cEquality\u201d or \u201cDiversity\u201d or to \u201cHuman-Rights.\u201d The liberal sees the world on this basis, as a series of ideas and concepts which have a kind of religious significance. What was very apparent, even from the Twitter threads, was that liberals refuse to engage with the notion of an ethnos. The notion of a nation as people broadly of a shared origin who relate organically to one another, is foreign to them.<br><br>Their outlook is essentially the outlook of Thomas Paine, which is based on the metaphysical assertion that Man in a State of Nature Is Free. They view the individual as the centre of everything. Society begins with the individual and the individual is its organising principle. Hence their obsessive focus on emotions, stimulants and desires. The original sin of Liberalism is the individualist fallacy. For the individual by itself, cannot regenerate. The individual by itself can not even survive for very long. The organising unit of society must be a social unit. And that social unit must be as organic and cohesive as possible. The family, the parish, the nation. It is a social communitarian ethos which is the organising basis of everything human-beings create.","filename":"2f5hw08gh0gnset59ghw57thq3-7hqwgwp59ghaerig","ext":".jpg","w":620,"h":330,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":66,"tim":1493488250274,"time":1493488250,"md5":"X4ky5k5E+MQsFyH8iY0p\/w==","fsize":51912,"resto":123352430,"id":"xKnSkzWB","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123358414,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)13:50:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123358123\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123358123<\/a><br>WE WUZ KANGZ<br><br>ANGLOS BTFO!!1!","time":1493488251,"resto":123352430,"id":"+fRI7fdB","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123358418,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)13:50:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123358201\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123358201<\/a><br>The interests of a Spanish fisherman are extremely different to a Welsh miner.","time":1493488253,"resto":123352430,"id":"0LFTfMUc","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123358474,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)13:51:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123357803\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123357803<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;tfw wealthy and white<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;tfw extremely safe tory seat<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;tfw unironically support labour for the first time in my life<\/span><br><br>it&#039;s an odd feel desu lads, am I a class traitor","time":1493488287,"resto":123352430,"id":"dYnqkC6c","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123358477,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)13:51:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123358168\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123358168<\/a><br>Jenna was great","time":1493488289,"resto":123352430,"id":"\/mgJQtJP","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123358511,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)13:51:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123358213\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123358213<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;Unionists hold all their seats in NI<\/span><br>Have you not seen the recent Stormont election?","time":1493488303,"resto":123352430,"id":"5pFC8xgk","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"},{"no":123358513,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)13:51:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123357198\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123357198<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Against a tory<\/span><br><br>not a chance","filename":"1467394401776","ext":".jpg","w":1089,"h":566,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":64,"tim":1493488305403,"time":1493488305,"md5":"lXtloqa\/xFxlQVh02fOErA==","fsize":82399,"resto":123352430,"id":"mGyhKgYL","country":"GB","m_img":1,"country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123358519,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)13:51:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123358382\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123358382<\/a><br>2030 now? <br><br>I thought it was 2020?","time":1493488309,"resto":123352430,"id":"0LFTfMUc","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123358525,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)13:51:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123357109\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123357109<\/a><br><br>Homos should stfu and stop being queer <br><br>Fucking leftist shits should get AIDS","time":1493488312,"resto":123352430,"id":"\/32Z\/\/Cu","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123358534,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)13:51:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123357957\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123357957<\/a><br>Coming from a man who&#039;s vehemently debating on said image board","time":1493488316,"resto":123352430,"id":"87wAp7+u","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123358560,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)13:52:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123358201\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123358201<\/a><br>sovereignty.<br><br>I also don&#039;t think we have enough in common with other Europeans.","time":1493488328,"resto":123352430,"id":"bWekgNcI","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123358570,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)13:52:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123357998\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123357998<\/a><br>Cheapest I&#039;ve come across is the &#039;walk-ups&#039; in Soho.<br><br>You&#039;ll get a quick BJ for \u00a320 or 10-15 mins of fucking for \u00a330.","time":1493488332,"resto":123352430,"id":"famAqrxy","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123358597,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)13:52:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123358405\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123358405<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;bluecirclesdiagram.jpg<\/span>","time":1493488346,"resto":123352430,"id":"0LFTfMUc","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123358631,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)13:52:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123357891\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123357891<\/a><br><br>I&#039;m surprised there aren&#039;t betting markets for shit like this.

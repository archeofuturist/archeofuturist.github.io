If you keep your daily fat intake within the recommended amount you will experience very little to no leakage- these people probably got on the pills and did not alter their diet one bit in order to get that level of soiling. <br><br>Some leakage can apparently occur during or just after a BM but honestly. if you&#039;re taking that kind of meds and not wearing an adult pad in order to minimize public accidents then you&#039;re pretty fucking retarded. So many people think it&#039;s a wonderdrug they can just pop and not have to make any sacrifices like changing their diet or wearing some discreet underwear liners - but then again, if they were willing to make those sacrifices they would probably just diet and work out instead of restoring to pills that carry a risk of orange oily anal leakage.","time":1490287708,"resto":117949267,"id":"TxLu2p03","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117952474,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)12:52:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117950916\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117950916<\/a><br>Big city retards.

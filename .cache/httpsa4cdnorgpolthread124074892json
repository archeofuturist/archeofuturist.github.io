The press never talks about it, very few french people know about it. <br><br>Macron is part of this club, so is Hollande, and basically everyone else who publicly supports Macron.<br><br>A few minutes before the debate, I was surprised to see that it was working, a lot of people were actually tweeting with the hashtag #ClubLeSi\u00e8cle. <br><br>I was thinking &quot;Good, it&#039;s going to be a top tweet and people are finally going to know what Le Si\u00e8cle is, it will make Macron weaker&quot;. <br><br>Except 20 minutes later, when I reloaded the page, there was no more tweets. No a single one. The Twitter team simply masked every tweet with this hashtag. <br><br>After the debate, they stopped masking them but there was only 19 tweets left with #ClubLeSi\u00e8cle in May. <br><br>19.

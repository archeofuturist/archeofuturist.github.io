The press never talks about it, very few french people know about it. <br><br>Macron is part of this club, so is Hollande, and basically everyone else who publicly supports Macron.<br><br>A few minutes before the debate, I was surprised to see that it was working, a lot of people were actually tweeting with the hashtag #ClubLeSi\u00e8cle. <br><br>I was thinking &quot;Good, it&#039;s going to be a top tweet and people are finally going to know what Le Si\u00e8cle is, it will make Macron weaker&quot;. <br><br>Except 20 minutes later, when I reloaded the page, there was no more tweets. No a single one. The Twitter team simply masked every tweet with this hashtag. <br><br>After the debate, they stopped masking them but there was only 19 tweets left with #ClubLeSi\u00e8cle in May. <br><br>19. How the fuck can there be only 19 left when this tweet was retweeted 1400 times? :<br><br>https:\/\/twitter.com\/SanglierSympa\/s<wbr>tatus\/859466198349737985<br><br>Not a single mainstream media talks about it. Every media who talks about it is labelled as &quot;fake news media&quot;. So if even the french twitter team is controlling tweets to protect the elite, we are completly lost.","filename":"2048x1536-fit_marine-pen-emmanuel-macron-lors-debat-presidentiel-3-mai-2017","ext":".png","w":1920,"h":1080,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1493914192680,"time":1493914192,"md5":"9S2nIbBZrNZARp1KW2TJSw==","fsize":1569176,"resto":0,"id":"VRPpfdqe","country":"FR","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"twitter-censored-a-during-the-french-debate","country_name":"France","replies":5,"images":0,"unique_ips":4},{"no":124075110,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)12:12:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124074892\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124074892<\/a><br>WTF<br>I clicked on the link to the tweet once, it was deleted, I reloaded the page and now it&#039;s here","time":1493914334,"resto":124074892,"id":"l7AA7sAO","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124075338,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)12:14:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/search?f=tweets<wbr>&amp;vertical=default&amp;q=clublesi%C3%A8c<wbr>le&amp;src=typd<br><br>When you go on the hashtag seach by date, there are only 6 tweets... 6 fucking tweets...","time":1493914471,"resto":124074892,"id":"VRPpfdqe","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":124075545,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)12:16:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"People have been lied to too much.

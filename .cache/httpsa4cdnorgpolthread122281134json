That is, it is impossible for it to not exist. That is, there is no metaphysical or natural law in accordance with which there does not exist circularity. <br><br>So your second premise needs to be modified. It is not that a law that forbids a creator &quot;hasn&#039;t been discovered&quot; -- it&#039;s that in principle there cannot be such a law. <br><br>The very essence of the being we are considering is existence. Meaning there is no possible way for it to not exist.<br><br>An essence is something that you cannot exist without. Your hair, for example, is not your essence, but your property of being self-identical is. <br><br>Thus the being we are considering is one who cannot possibly not-exist. It is a necessary being, in the same sense of necessity as circularity. If it is even possible that such a being exists, then such a being actually exists. <br><br>All this shows, however, is that a necessary being exists. We would need additional argumentation to suppose that the being is capable of action and actually created us, which can be shown but it is a separate discussion.","time":1492871505,"resto":122281134,"id":"Ytt7vY8V","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122283349,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)10:41:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122282347\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122282347<\/a><br>It&#039;s up for debate on what such a gods nature would be.<br><br>I&#039;m fairly sure, heaven, salvation and things like that are wishful thinking. <br><br>A god has no liability to preserve your soul, even less when you&#039;re apart of a cancer on the planet.<br><br>I&#039;m a part of a bible study group, much of what they say seems to be their interpretations of the bible and nothing substantially theological merit","time":1492872095,"resto":122281134,"id":"fg6OmHcr","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":122283558,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)10:43:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"In order to show that the necessary being created us or even cares about us, a natural question would be: is there any evidence that the being has interacted with us or attempted to establish contact with us in the past?

Most of us, if we were God, would have nuked this place a long time ago and started anew. <br><br>When you reflect on just how bad things have become, that we are ruled by human trafficking regimes and all the torture they inflict on the innocent, for example, it is very difficult to see why God has any reason to preserve anything of humanity much less our souls. <br><br>I suppose there are some good qualities about us too, and the bad things people do should not veto out everything good done by others. <br><br>If we add that the necessary being is extremely wise, then maybe we can make sense of the fact that the being offers salvation to some of us, despite having every reason not to. <br><br>For a wise being would know to judge the heart, and would distinguish the redeemable aspects of creation from those that are willfully doomed. <br><br> A wise being would be patient, and would not cast us all away just because a subset of us is morally deformed.<br><br>I readily admit it is wishful thinking that we&#039;ve been given a second chance, but that does not entail it&#039;s not true. <br><br>You can wishfully think you&#039;ll end up with a beautiful woman, and it is logically consistent with that wishful thinking that you actually do some day. This is the true meaning of &quot;faith,&quot; a reasonable optimism that guides behavior and brings about real results. <br><br>The wishy washy &quot;blind faith&quot; that people interpret in the bible (or actually impose onto it where it is not there) is just BS.

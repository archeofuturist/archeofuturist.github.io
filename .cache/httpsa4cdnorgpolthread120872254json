He is actually a liberal backed by mummy-like in terms of beliefs FSB agents and officials (rebuilding the empire and shit). in 90&#039;s russia wasn&#039;t exactly ruled by Eltsen but by 7 jewish bankers. They were interested in dividing Russia into pack of controllable shithole nation states, to further use us as a cheap meat against China - the last big country showing signs of independence to NWO. Putin infiltrated those bankers pretending to be &quot;ourguy&quot; to them and convinced them to make him a next president. When he gained power, however they quickly realised he has teeth as he started to remove the most obvious &quot;mad dogs&quot;. The invisible fight for the support of ex-commie\\bandit corrupt officials had started. Bankers offered money. Putin offered them safety (Law immunity as long as they say what fsb told them to say). They chose safety. Then Putin tried ti blend into western world as equall, as any liberal on his place would. But he was first fed by tomorrows and then, probably in 2009-2012 NWO leaders basically told him something like&quot;Yeah we are for equall human rights but you and your folk are subhumans, so be glad we let you live at all, and start obeying us, or we may change our mind&quot;. It kinda insulted his pride and he decided to resist. But when he started to put Russia in war-ready shape it quickly became obvious that officials he made a pact with are more loyal to west then to him and will sabotage his attempts to do shit. He can remove them one by one, but combined they are capable of owerthrowing him. So he started to slowly, carefully push them back from critical positions, replacing them by his people.","time":1492068024,"resto":120872254,"id":"d+Wd8dbV","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":120882925,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)03:21:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120874497\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120874497<\/a><br>This","filename":"IMG_5807","ext":".jpg","w":1618,"h":1920,"tn_w":105,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492068097050,"time":1492068097,"md5":"yoiGrwPFG3xT9sbTr5P2qA==","fsize":1221404,"resto":120872254,"id":"U5KjI7ih","country":"RU","m_img":1,"country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":120883045,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)03:23:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120882925\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120882925<\/a><br>oh shit<br>is left guy Orthodox?","time":1492068190,"resto":120872254,"id":"OR9fqD6d","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":120883085,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)03:23:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120874497\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120874497<\/a><br>In mother Russia, Putin overthrows you.","time":1492068218,"resto":120872254,"id":"OqPXI+yI","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120883097,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)03:23:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120882813\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120882813<\/a><br>vatnikas stop posting.

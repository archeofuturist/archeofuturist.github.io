It suggests, true female, true feminine and even true feminist which means a return to the original First Wave feminist values (rather than the over-extended form that exists now):<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; First-wave feminism was a period of activity during the 19th century and early twentieth century. In the UK and US, it focused on the promotion of equal contract, marriage, parenting, and property rights for women. By the end of the 19th century, activism focused primarily on gaining political power, particularly the right of women&#039;s suffrage, though some feminists were active in campaigning for women&#039;s sexual, reproductive, and economic rights as well.<\/span><br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Femin<wbr>ism#Nineteenth_and_early_twentieth_<wbr>centuries<br><br>The main difference is that baby making is far more important than first envisioned. The promotion of condoms, though, does help stop the spread of sexual diseases which was and is a serious issue, so suppressing condoms would be a step backwards for human health. If we ally with First Wave feminism we can&#039;t be accused of anti-feminist as a bonus! First Wave feminism goes back to the French Revolution (1789) so it matches the ideals of traditional and Western as well. This also adds to a inherent division in feminist movements, which is highlighted by the failure of Second Wave feminism.

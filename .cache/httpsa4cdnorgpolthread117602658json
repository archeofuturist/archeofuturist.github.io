In the last century a commonly punted around figure is 100,000,000 deaths or in the area thereof in the communist world due to starvation or suppression. The same things happened in China, Cambodia, North Korea as in Russia. The fault was not of the ethnic Russians, but steeped in the ideology itself. The starvation began after the collectivization of the land owned previous by Kulak farmers. This is something that would take place in any country that attempted to implement communist ideology and indeed it did in China, Cambodia, NK etc under their respective revolutionaries.

His religion is a revelation from an intelligence which is certainly not that of man. One can absolutely find nowhere, but in Him alone, the imitation or the example of His life.

Such a view would conflict with Galatians 1:1, which ascribes the resurrection of Jesus to the Father, not to the Son. By his perfect obedience as a human, Jesus provided the moral basis for the Father to raise him from the dead, thus acknowledging Jesus as God\u2019s Son. Because of Jesus\u2019 faithful course of life, it could properly be said that Jesus himself was responsible for his resurrection.<br><br>Says A. T. Robertson in Word Pictures in the New Testament: \u201cRecall [John] 2:19 where Jesus said: \u2018And in three days I will raise it up.\u2019 He did not mean that he will raise himself from the dead independently of the Father as the active agent (Rom. 8:11).\u201d\u2014(New York, 1932), Vol. V, p. 183.<br><br>At John 10:30 when saying, When saying, \u201cI and the Father are one,\u201d did Jesus mean that they were equal? Some Trinitarians say that he did. But at John 17:21, 22, Jesus prayed regarding his followers: \u201cThat they may all be one,\u201d and he added, \u201cthat they may be one even as we are one.\u201d He used the same Greek word (hen) for \u201cone\u201d in all these instances. Obviously, Jesus\u2019 disciples do not all become part of the Trinity. But they do come to share a oneness of purpose with the Father and the Son, the same sort of oneness that unites God and Christ.","time":1491885887,"resto":120527094,"id":"3Am6mbzo","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120554559,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)00:45:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120553867\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120553867<\/a><br>Asking whether Abraham was justified by circumsision basically proves the point that Paul addresses the work of the Torah in context.

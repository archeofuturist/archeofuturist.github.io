It makes the &quot;commanding heights&quot; of economy not individual production, but rather political sway upon bureaucratic systems which are far more centered around the monopoly upon force than attempts at productive behavior. It upends the system, in body, mind, and spirit. There is no degree of productivity or industry that you could engage in that gives you greater political sway... whereas greater political sway (over a controlled economy) grants you additional access to rewards. The moment such a system is enacted, hard work and industry become meaningless, manipulation and political power become ESSENTIAL. In a system where politics is everything, the latent nature of political game theory becomes dominant. Outgroups, and demonized others, being the strongest form of political rhetoric in times of finite resources, become almost necessary. And thus gulags, and political re-education are also necessary. These are symptoms of a system dominated by political gamesmanship, which, as I mentioned above, become critical under a communist system.","time":1493535158,"resto":123447438,"id":"zJlu\/fJK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123448674,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)02:52:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Communism<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Free America<\/span><br>Nice contradiction.<br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=j-H<wbr>GkCKSetk","time":1493535179,"resto":123447438,"id":"DHGtv6UM","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123448680,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)02:53:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123448119\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123448119<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;he does it for free.<\/span>","time":1493535183,"resto":123447438,"id":"Vt1bKYDR","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123448699,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)02:53:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"What this creates is a complete shift in the game theory of the economic structure.

The most tragic stage of this illness, is when the decreasing level of economic production reaches such a critical point where the rise in food costs becomes a noticable burden upon the broader country. The tragedy in such cases is that the political leadership (having necessarily become totalitarian) will necessarily eat, as the broader-level starvation becomes more endemic. This includes the lower-level bureaucracies at each level going down, which were set up to monitor prices and equity. The monitors of equity themselves become de-facto plantation owners... due to great necessity and the collapse of broader productivity, individual citizens are forced to cultivate crops and other basic necessities in secret from bureaucrats, whose rapacity has become hungrier due to deprivation. Thus, in the final stages of communism, those attempting desperately even to just feed themselves, are singled out and targeted.

Kropotkin wasn&#039;t about rule by force but rather voluntary communes.Kropotkin was born wealthy but gave up his riches of his own volition to help the destitute, and even showed how Darwin&#039;s theory of survival of the fittest is flawed because mutual aid presents itself in all life.

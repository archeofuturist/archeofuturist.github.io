Daily reminder that sea levels around the world were about 400 feet lower just before the end of the last Ice Age.<br><br>Near the end of the last Ice Age about 12,800 years ago, a giant comet that had entered the Solar System from deep space thousands of years earlier, broke into multiple fragments.

At least eight of the fragments hit the North American ice cap, while further fragments hit the Northern European ice cap. The impacts, from comet fragments a mile wide approaching at more than 60,000 miles an hour, generated huge amounts of heat which instantly liquidised millions of square kilometres of ice, destabilising Earth&#039;s crust and causing the global flood that is remembered in myths all around the world.<br><br>A second series of impacts, equally devastasting, causing further cataclysmic flooding, occurred about 11,600 years ago, the exact date that Plato gives for the destruction and submergence of Atlantis.

Yes, it is true that there are some variations of Zodiac symbols here and there (for example, the Babylonians considered the constellation of Pisces to be represented by a sparrow), but the Zodiac symbols we Westerners are familiar with today have nevertheless existed for many thousands of years. Bolstering this argument is the fact that Indian astrology also uses the same Zodiac symbols (for example, Pisces is also represented by a fish in Indian astrology) and Indian mythology itself outright describes human lineages extending over a BILLION years into the past (you can read about these human lineages in the Puranas). This knowledge of astrology and the Zodiac also existed in Ancient Egypt, as demonstrated by the lion-bodied Sphinx (which was originally lion-headed to match its body). The Sphinx had the head of lion because it was created during the Age of Leo, which was between 11,000 to 13,000 years ago, which also means that it was created during the Younger Dryas period.

This is the reason why about 5,000 years ago, ancient civilisations in places like Egypt and Sumer seem to have appeared virtually overnight and also seemed to suddenly have knowledge of astronomy, mathematics, agriculture, etc. It&#039;s because that knowledge was INHERITED from that previous civilisation (some people call this previous civilisation &#039;Atlantis&#039;, but personally, I think this shit is WAAAAAY BIGGER than Atlantis).

It takes into account all marriages across all income levels, all races, all levels of education, all religions and includes second, thrid and forth marriages. The divorce rate for religious, white, middle class suburbanites is far lower when compared to inner city youths marrying and remarrying. Even considering this, the divorce rate is steadily decreasing.<br><br>And even in the event of divorce, the public perception of alimony is very warped. The tabloids will have you believe that: Alimony is guarenteed in all divorce cases. Alimony is paid for the rest of your life. Alimony is forced on people no matter what their incomes.<br>This is all false. Alimony is rare. It only occurs in 10-15% of all divorce cases. The rate is rapidly decreasing because of gender equality in income. Lifelong alimony is almost never awarded. Judges view alimony as a system of welfare, and is only paid for a short time after the marriage. And judges always base the alimony on the payers income and financial position. It is incredibly rare to have your life ruined by alimony.<br><br>As for marriage taking away peoples freedom, that is a stupid argument.

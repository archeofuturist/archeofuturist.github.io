Like the economy, it is rigged in the interests of a few.&#039; This leaves our liberal, democratic order \u2013 the mechanism that has allowed a historically unprecedented proportion of humanity to flourish \u2013 facing a twin assault: oligarchs on the one hand, radical populists on the other.<br>Reassessing history and politics, Rebel puts forward a bold new thesis: we are not the first to face such a threat. Oligarchic cartels have clogged the arteries of nations and economies throughout history, triggering radical insurgencies in protest. But all too often the radicals have strengthened the hand of the oligarchs: the Roman, Venetian and Dutch republics all succumbed to cartels. &#039;Anti-oligarch radicals,&#039; the author notes, &#039;have often made the oligarchs seem the more attractive option.&#039; So, too, today, he suggests.<br>In the face of these twin threats, Carswell mounts a robust defence of the liberal, democratic order. Drawing on his first-hand experience in taking on \u2013 and beating \u2013 the established political parties, he proposes a profound reform of politics and capitalism to free us from the cartels, listing the practical steps needed to make this revolutionary change happen.","filename":"61tXLhCbOlL","ext":".jpg","w":632,"h":1000,"tn_w":79,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492898161715,"time":1492898161,"md5":"9lHL2M9Cx1C9VPBTvK2QiQ==","fsize":108795,"resto":122332884,"id":"9YcM4jID","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122333453,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)17:56:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;tfw 4chanx starts being proper shit and forces you to reload page every 5 minutes<\/span>","filename":"reeee0","ext":".jpg","w":680,"h":680,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492898200417,"time":1492898200,"md5":"YqfWU6dnnHd6nOEnW+VwVA==","fsize":36619,"resto":122332884,"id":"Uc4teXL4","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122333492,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)17:56:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122333288\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122333288<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;a party formed explicitly to take away votes from the Tories was a Tory experiment<\/span>","filename":"Nick Young","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":431,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":107,"tim":1492898218263,"time":1492898218,"md5":"Qk2GTYYvHEDUXMGpPj3l7w==","fsize":35502,"resto":122332884,"id":"LJMc83LD","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122333498,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)17:57:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122333296\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122333296<\/a>","filename":"1488779547678","ext":".png","w":200,"h":200,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492898221532,"time":1492898221,"md5":"Uggu5Xyie3zfZIwvvi5ngQ==","fsize":55631,"resto":122332884,"id":"2j+YPS4+","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122333533,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)17:57:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122333288\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122333288<\/a><br>hmmmm","time":1492898238,"resto":122332884,"id":"jZb5rUE1","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122333550,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)17:57:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122333288\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122333288<\/a><br>Isn&#039;t he a clever one?

There&#039;s no shame in admitting that despite the infinite intellectual and moral superiority of the white race, BBC is just better at pleasing women.<br><br>The reason white women are turning from the cause and running to niggers is simply because they are not being fully sexually satisfied. Can you blame them? If you dont get enough to eat at home youre going to go out to eat. The only way to save the white race from miscegenation is cuckolding. My pure white wife is my angel, the apple of my eye. And I want nothing but the best for her. So every friday she gets to have her fill of BBC. And our relationship goes on like normal. We love each other, and plan on having a child soon. She totally shares my red pilled beliefs.<br><br>Monogamy is a tool of the Eldar. Just give cuckolding a chance once. Its exhilarating.

Like the economy, it is rigged in the interests of a few.&#039; This leaves our liberal, democratic order \u2013 the mechanism that has allowed a historically unprecedented proportion of humanity to flourish \u2013 facing a twin assault: oligarchs on the one hand, radical populists on the other.<br>Reassessing history and politics, Rebel puts forward a bold new thesis: we are not the first to face such a threat. Oligarchic cartels have clogged the arteries of nations and economies throughout history, triggering radical insurgencies in protest. But all too often the radicals have strengthened the hand of the oligarchs: the Roman, Venetian and Dutch republics all succumbed to cartels. &#039;Anti-oligarch radicals,&#039; the author notes, &#039;have often made the oligarchs seem the more attractive option.&#039; So, too, today, he suggests.<br>In the face of these twin threats, Carswell mounts a robust defence of the liberal, democratic order. Drawing on his first-hand experience in taking on \u2013 and beating \u2013 the established political parties, he proposes a profound reform of politics and capitalism to free us from the cartels, listing the practical steps needed to make this revolutionary change happen.","filename":"61tXLhCbOlL","ext":".jpg","w":632,"h":1000,"tn_w":79,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492898161715,"time":1492898161,"md5":"9lHL2M9Cx1C9VPBTvK2QiQ==","fsize":108795,"resto":122332884,"id":"9YcM4jID","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122333453,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)17:56:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;tfw 4chanx starts being proper shit and forces you to reload page every 5 minutes<\/span>","filename":"reeee0","ext":".jpg","w":680,"h":680,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492898200417,"time":1492898200,"md5":"YqfWU6dnnHd6nOEnW+VwVA==","fsize":36619,"resto":122332884,"id":"Uc4teXL4","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122333492,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)17:56:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122333288\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122333288<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;a party formed explicitly to take away votes from the Tories was a Tory experiment<\/span>","filename":"Nick Young","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":431,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":107,"tim":1492898218263,"time":1492898218,"md5":"Qk2GTYYvHEDUXMGpPj3l7w==","fsize":35502,"resto":122332884,"id":"LJMc83LD","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122333498,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)17:57:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122333296\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122333296<\/a>","filename":"1488779547678","ext":".png","w":200,"h":200,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492898221532,"time":1492898221,"md5":"Uggu5Xyie3zfZIwvvi5ngQ==","fsize":55631,"resto":122332884,"id":"2j+YPS4+","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122333533,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)17:57:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122333288\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122333288<\/a><br>hmmmm","time":1492898238,"resto":122332884,"id":"jZb5rUE1","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122333550,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)17:57:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122333288\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122333288<\/a><br>Isn&#039;t he a clever one?

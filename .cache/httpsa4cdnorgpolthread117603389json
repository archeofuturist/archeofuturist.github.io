How do I reconcile these beliefs when it is the global jew elite who is promoting occultism and gnosticism? Does anyone know if there is a difference between the dark arts of the elite and the light of the kaballah, gnostic arts and that stuff? I feel like there is definitely a difference between the two, but they are also similar in almost every way. Freemasons, theosophists, order of the rose, etc are globalist as fuck and seem to promote evil, but also follow the ancient mystery schools which I identify as containing great wisdom. Lucifer is considered the lightbringer, which goes against my understanding with being anti-NWO, who are lucifarians. Overall I&#039;m really confused. Are the globalists actually right? Does humanity need to be culled and to live under a lucifarian world order?

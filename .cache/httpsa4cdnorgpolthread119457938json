Those political parties will keep on growing, due to the massive differences of demographics between europeans and arabs, and in a couple of decades, you&#039;ll have Arab Political Parties in charge, democratically elected by the arab ethnic minorities that are no longer minorities. Get it? <br><br>Look at DENK in NL (Turkish party).

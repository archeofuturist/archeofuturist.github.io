The pact opened up Korea, as Commodore Matthew Perry&#039;s fleet of Black Ships had opened up Japan in 1853. According to the treaty, it ended Joseon&#039;s status as a tributary state of Qing dynasty and opened three ports to Japanese trade. The Treaty also granted Japanese many of the same rights in Korea that Westerners enjoyed in Japan, such as extraterritoriality.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The following year saw a Japanese fleet led by Special Envoy Kuroda Kiyotaka coming over to Korea, demanding an apology from the Joseon government and a commercial treaty between the two nations. The Korean government decided to accept the demand, in hope of importing some technologies to defend the country from any future invasions.<\/span><br>However, the treaty would eventually turn out to be the first of many unequal treaties signed by Korea; It gave extraterritorial rights to Japanese citizens in Korea, and forced the Korean government to open 3 ports to Japan, specifically Busan, Incheon and Wonsan. With the signing of its first unequal treaty, Korea became vulnerable to the influence of imperialistic powers; and later the treaty led Korea to be annexed by Japan.<br><br>It was basically to Korea what the treaty of versailles was to Post World War 1 Germany. <br><br>It might not have been official until 1910, but Japan made Korea it&#039;s bitch way back in the 19th century. <br><br>And thus the korean\/japanese bitchood spans 2 calendar centuries.

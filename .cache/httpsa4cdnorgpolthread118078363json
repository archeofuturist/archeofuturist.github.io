And it ends up destroying the economy and the very capitalists themselves.<br><br>Think about it. Here is an example. Baby boomers are some of the worst capitalists and were behind the majority of outsourcing to 3rd world countries and so on. What is the result? Now the baby boomers are STILL supporting their children who are now in their 30s because they cannot find a job. Baby boomers shipped off all the jobs to China and India and as a result their own children cannot find a job and so the baby boomers have to spend huge amounts of their own savings and money to support their own children who are now in their fucking 30s and should be financially independent by now.<br><br>Now the baby boomer capitalists have no choice to retire and have to work until the day they die.

It&#039;s super fast and easy and you can always change back when the heat&#039;s off!<br>Do I hate modern Republicans\/Conservatives\/Tea Party with every fiber of my being? You bet your ass I do. Do I think they have any moral ground to stand on? Not a fucking square inch.<br>Am I completely justified in this abject, all-consuming hatred? Absolutely, and here&#039;s why.<br>Today&#039;s Republican is an engineered-in-the-propaganda-lab monster that is so brainwashed they couldn&#039;t recognize human decency if it gave them a nice tuna sandwich and the cure for cancer.<br>What does the modern Republican Party stand for? The very, very wealthy, aka the billionaire political donor class.<br>What do they want?<br>More oil pipelines when fossil fuels are proven to harm the environment and lead to trillions in losses.<br>Less wind, solar and geothermal energy.<br>Mexicans, Muslims and Blacks to know their place, STFU and stop voting against them.<br>They don&#039;t want to press one for English.<br>Reduced gun laws. MOAR GUNS<br>Control over women&#039;s bodies and their sexuality.<br>Control over LGBT people, no marriage for them and gross reductions of their civil rights. Gay bathroom sex is still ok for Senators and State Reps only, of course.<br>Less regulation over polluters.<br>Less taxes for rich, more taxes for the poor.<br>They want to abolish the Dept of Education and have children homeschooled by Christian parents that reject science in favor of religious myths.<br>More religion and less atheism.<br>More guns and bombs and no school lunch programs.<br>Reduced social safety nets of every kind.<br>Privatizing Social Security so their wealthy friends can steal it easier. 1\/2","filename":"IMG_2351","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":333,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1492571445267,"time":1492571445,"md5":"1dBOqkRXRfYmWybK8eFZNA==","fsize":71073,"resto":0,"id":"gxj4Hh4q","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"hey-pedes-when-your-republican-candidates-flail","country_name":"United States","replies":6,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":121792371,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)23:12:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121792183\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121792183<\/a><br>They want, as Grover Norquist says, a government small enough to drown in the bathtub.<br>Unlimited bribes via Citizens United, unchecked cronyism and nepotism to be at their pleasure with no liberal media to call them on it.<br>A Supreme Court that will rule in their favor on all these thefts.<br>A rich, orange, pussy-grabbing doofus as their Ultimate Champion.

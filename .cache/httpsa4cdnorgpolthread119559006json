Why did this happen? Well, it turns out Donald&#039;s sister, Maryanne Trump Barry, was a judge in New Jersey and conveniently received Weichselbaum&#039;s case. (At this point alarm bells might be going off bigly: Bush Sr ran cocaine procurement overseas, Clinton importation in Mena Arkansas and Trump a distributor - so the cushy relationship starts to make sense beyond campaign donations and wedding party attendance)<br><br>Donald Trump also became close associates with Saudi billionaire Adnan Khashoggi, who was implicated in the Iran-Contra scandal (source of funds being the Bush-Clinton-Trump cocaine racket). Trump and Khashoggi had much in common as socialites, both reveling in flaunting wealth and showmanship. Trump said he read every word ever written about Khashoggi, bought Khashoggi&#039;s yacht, and socialized with Khashoggi&#039;s lieutenants like Ramy El-Batwari.<br><br>It should become clear that Trump associates with criminals as a rule rather than a mistake by now, but here&#039;s one more: [Felix Sater](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wik<wbr>i\/Felix_Sater#Work_with_the_Bayrock<wbr>_Group).

All of this ties back into the Morgan affair, with the anti-Masonic party challenging Andrew Jackson for the presidency and Jackson having been involved in his own secession attempts in Louisiana for which Aaron Burr took the blame.<br><br>So let&#039;s fast forward a bit to get to the point of the thread. In 1947 the church of scientology is created. Mormonism is often referred to as &quot;scientology lite&quot; and scientology is just &quot;freemasonry lite.&quot; Masons made a big stink back when Mormonism was created about it &quot;stealing&quot; the rites of masonry, but this was just thinly veiled advertising of Mormonism because the religion was created and financed by freemasons, same as scientology.<br><br>L Ron Hubbard actually coined the term &quot;prison planet,&quot; Alex Jones&#039; original website. Then the name &quot;infowars&quot; comes from the CIA&#039;s Mockingbird \/ MK Ultra programs, Michael Aquino&#039;s &quot;MINDWAR&quot; book.<br>People like Norman Peale (Trump&#039;s pastor, freemason) are the public heads of Freezone scientology. Trump&#039;s only 9\/11 charity donation is to a scientology charity co-founded by Tom Cruise. There are a lot of weirdos surrounding Trump along these lines like Paula White. The most exoteric form of what they practice is something like Oprah&#039;s &quot;positive thinking&quot; stuff.","filename":"Scientology_Trump","ext":".png","w":1000,"h":1500,"tn_w":83,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491362352632,"time":1491362352,"md5":"nX7YjWnYRH9A1xybOLkzuw==","fsize":260596,"resto":119559006,"id":"WHqKT2E+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119559587,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)23:19:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119559412\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119559412<\/a>","filename":"soon","ext":".png","w":990,"h":343,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":43,"tim":1491362353314,"time":1491362353,"md5":"P7oqVPu1i46jdYZ6ix0U4w==","fsize":846832,"resto":119559006,"id":"ifNVcKLm","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119559591,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)23:19:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119559372\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119559372<\/a><br><a href=\"#p119559326\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119559326<\/a><br><a href=\"#p119559288\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119559288<\/a><br><a href=\"#p119559254\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119559254<\/a><br>Your autism doesn&#039;t matter","time":1491362355,"resto":119559006,"id":"q7D0Ae0W","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119559612,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)23:19:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119559301\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119559301<\/a><br>NUCLEAR OPTION","time":1491362369,"resto":119559006,"id":"rdXWHrvK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119559614,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)23:19:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119559301\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119559301<\/a><br>Yes","filename":"mcconnell-turtle-zpse425164e","ext":".png","w":469,"h":313,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1491362370671,"time":1491362370,"md5":"BA\/ez3P\/SxMe8wD9tjsmNA==","fsize":188471,"resto":119559006,"id":"UVIOR12o","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119559617,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)23:19:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"Report spammers.","time":1491362372,"resto":119559006,"id":"r+rcI\/rt","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119559648,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)23:19:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"So, about Trump&#039;s paycheck; is it legal to refuse a paycheck from the government?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What?<\/span><br>If the role is defined by the state, and the hire is a contract, then can the contract be changed at whim or is the holder of the office obligated to take payment?","time":1491362392,"resto":119559006,"id":"KPyZ00nU","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119559652,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)23:19:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"As far as funding for Jones\/Trump goes, ultimately all of this is CIA connected, but to give you a name for the rabbit hole: Khashoggi.

He then wanted to use the reform party as his foray into politics on the ballot in a 2000 run but the reform party fell apart before the election.<br><br>After the 2000 election there was no point for him to consider a run again until 2008, as he could not run as a Republican. Yet again the process locked him out in favor of establishment candidate McCain but he also did not wish to run in 2008 due to the unpopularity of the Republican party of the time.","filename":"1491283201225","ext":".jpg","w":2893,"h":1929,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1491362978013,"time":1491362978,"md5":"uInZP360qzhh3jMHj1+0tA==","fsize":756059,"resto":119559006,"id":"2xpZn4cD","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":119560744,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)23:29:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119560640\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119560640<\/a><br>Can you imagine how bad a place like this would be for a schizophrenic","time":1491362979,"resto":119559006,"id":"q7D0Ae0W","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119560745,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)23:29:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119560384\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119560384<\/a><br>Desperate shilling won&#039;t save you guys.","filename":"1463953816442","ext":".png","w":626,"h":693,"tn_w":112,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491362979703,"time":1491362979,"md5":"n2grNx9UYPkAxHaGQnXThg==","fsize":270014,"resto":119559006,"id":"fAou0wR9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119560781,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)23:30:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119560427\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119560427<\/a><br>Supply and command anon, Trump was tested and he passed with flying carpets.","filename":"ricky","ext":".jpg","w":480,"h":360,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1491363000162,"time":1491363000,"md5":"xthuISLbHpGGfCw4+oULQw==","fsize":22718,"resto":119559006,"id":"t1cvxNQj","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119560784,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)23:30:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119560660\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119560660<\/a><br>for now","time":1491363001,"resto":119559006,"id":"KoFbkNnY","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119560786,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)23:30:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119560743\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119560743<\/a><br>He was able to get votes at a lower cost in primaries than any republican candidate in history.<br><br>His combination of very smart hires like Manafort (who won the primaries for every republican he served) and a lean crew using social media to largely propel the message was drastically more cost effective than any other campaign.<br><br>Just like his mentor Perot in the past, Trump was able to self-fund his campaign, largely, due to his enormous wealth, and did not have to serve interests or do events that he did not deem to gain him the votes he needed.<br><br>He went on to win the presidency at the lowest relative campaign cost in modern American political history.

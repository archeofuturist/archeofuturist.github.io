Anarchy once already existed, it was called low authority tribalism. It was shitty and violent.<br><br>Lastly, if the &quot;gibs&quot; you give to your children doesn&#039;t make them turn out for more gibsmedats later, why would &quot;gibs&quot; given from the community do so?<br><br><a href=\"#p118175901\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118175901<\/a><br>Yes, I agree.<br><br>I highly recommended you look for my ID and read my other posts, of course charity must be voluntary but my issue is people choose not to be charitable and instead use people in extreme poverty as a means of increasing their own status and elitism.

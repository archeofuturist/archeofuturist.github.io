I don&#039;t really believe in God, and I have a bad track record with religion growing up LDS, but there&#039;s something about the identity and the culture of Catholicism that is really appealing to me. Do I need to have rock solid faith to join, or is some interest and enthusiasm enough?","filename":"IMG_2426","ext":".jpg","w":277,"h":182,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":164,"tim":1490922346143,"time":1490922346,"md5":"0g8FJiMzoEhpoPkVina3Xw==","fsize":26055,"resto":0,"id":"GQcAsbgG","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"hey-pol-i-really-like-the-idea-of-being-a","country_name":"United States","replies":16,"images":2,"unique_ips":10},{"no":118997941,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)21:12:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;I don&#039;t really believe in God<\/span><br><br>I would watch these if I were you <br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=v2X<wbr>sp4FRgas&amp;list=PL1mr9ZTZb3TViAqtowpv<wbr>Zy5PZpn-MoSK_","time":1490922746,"resto":118997141,"id":"GW5UqvAN","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118998156,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)21:14:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118997141\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118997141<\/a><br>fuck off we&#039;re full","filename":"1452366137685","ext":".jpg","w":1742,"h":1582,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":113,"tim":1490922860484,"time":1490922860,"md5":"r80fJEhuOuiWQpeOKWWvqg==","fsize":967618,"resto":118997141,"id":"h\/l7yYUr","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":118998318,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)21:15:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"You pretty much just have to go through the program and some rituals to join.<br><br>But I don&#039;t know why you&#039;d want to if it&#039;s not really something really believe in.

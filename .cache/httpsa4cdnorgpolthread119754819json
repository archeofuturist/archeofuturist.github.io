Assad just defeated ISIS in his country. He is hailed as a hero by his people. He has Russia on his side. He got rid of his chemical weapons back in 2014. Last week, Tillerson said that the Syrian people will, alone, decide the fate of Syria. And for years Trump has said going into Syria is stupid. You even had Tulsi Gabbard go on live TV to say that Assad did not do these things.<br>Then, one week after Tillerson&#039;s announcement, Assad on top of the world... he does a chemical attack on his own people. Children, no less.<br>My only question is: Why? Why the fuck would he do that?<br>Has Trump been compromised?<br>Does it matter?<br>One of the great gifts of this election was the destruction of the media&#039;s credibility, and the rise of alternative voices. Now, even Trump is compromised, our voices are too powerful. We wont go to war without a fight.<br>These are not the Iraq War days.<br><br>Sources:<br>https:\/\/mobile.twitter.com\/JustinRa<wbr>imondo\/status\/849751305346195456\/vi<wbr>deo\/1<br><br>http:\/\/www.globalresearch.ca\/hillar<wbr>y-clinton-approved-delivering-libya<wbr>s-sarin-gas-to-syrian-rebels-seymou<wbr>r-hersh\/5522647<br><br>https:\/\/theconservativetreehouse.co<wbr>m\/2017\/04\/04\/president-trump-has-it<wbr>-wrong-on-syria-assad-did-not-use-c<wbr>hemical-weapons-deep-state-neo-cons<wbr>-misleading-the-president\/<br><br>https:\/\/www.lrb.co.uk\/v35\/n24\/seymo<wbr>ur-m-hersh\/whose-sarin<br><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/qr_ByQH2QY0<br><br>http:\/\/www.informationliberation.co<wbr>m\/?id=56539","filename":"Screenshot_20170406-073244","ext":".jpg","w":1410,"h":1361,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":241,"tim":1491493588458,"time":1491493588,"md5":"czKl227j\/aFwMHAPUvdVxg==","fsize":736058,"resto":0,"id":"iZCn0teG","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"there-will-be-no-war","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":119755081,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)11:48:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"I meant to say &quot;...even IF Trump is compromised...&quot;","time":1491493725,"resto":119754819,"id":"iZCn0teG","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119755748,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)11:55:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119754819\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119754819<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Assad gassed his own people! <\/span><br><br>I&#039;m shocked people actually believe this and defend it with such conviction <br><br>The entire story reeks<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;war-backers can&#039;t get Europe or USA into war<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Assad randomly decides to break all wartime rules and gas his own people<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Suddenly, off to war we go!<\/span><br><br>It&#039;s such a typical Jew move<br><br>Even if it DID happen who gives a shit.

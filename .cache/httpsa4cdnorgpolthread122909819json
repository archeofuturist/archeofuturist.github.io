When I graduated from college, I had not even an inkling that I was trans. But over the course of a year, I went from total ignorance to actually coming out. And coming out to yourself, especially when you\u2019re trans, is the biggest hurdle<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Something that contributed to that self-awareness was seeing transgender images on-screen. The storylines weren\u2019t always perfect and neither were the characters, but they were there. They were living their truths. I saw characters that I could look at and see myself reflected in \u2013 and that made a huge difference in my life.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;3 Generations, distributed by The Weinstein Co. and starring Elle Fanning, Naomi Watts, and Susan Sarandon, comes out on May 5. Elle Fanning plays Ray, a teenage boy who is also transgender. The powerful family drama allows audiences to get to know Ray\u2019s mother and grandmother as they advocate for their trans child and grandchild. It\u2019s a touching story about what really makes a family, and one that will not only provide transgender boys like Ray a character they can finally relate to, but parents of transgender youth a look into a family that deals with issues similar to ones they face. <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;All that differentiates the film from other PG-13 films is a few instances of strong language. The film does not include graphic violence, drug use, or nudity \u2013 it merely portrays a modern family.<\/span>","filename":"LHmyMDrhzOlogRG-556x313-cropped","ext":".jpg","w":556,"h":313,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1493227770231,"time":1493227770,"md5":"n4qWJ2zJWTbusdwiWAm09g==","fsize":39902,"resto":0,"id":"zrO\/mope","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"r-rating-for-transgender-youth-movie","country_name":"United States","replies":17,"images":3,"unique_ips":17},{"no":122910006,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)13:31:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"Impressionable people shouldn&#039;t be exposed to this mental illness degenerate trash.","time":1493227860,"resto":122909819,"id":"tEdk4p+\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122910263,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)13:33:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"Naomi, why are you doing this.<br><br>why.","time":1493227984,"resto":122909819,"id":"YQlK3Rgs","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":122910376,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)13:34:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122909819\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122909819<\/a><br>(((((Weinstein)))))","time":1493228048,"resto":122909819,"id":"2QKxs7fx","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122910607,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)13:35:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"That is a problem.

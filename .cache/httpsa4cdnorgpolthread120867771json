You also need to be very aware of when you&#039;re trying to believe your own narrative vs just see the world for what it is. For example, I live in Toronto. Every day there is someone playing terrible music very loudly on the subway. It is always a black man and it is always rap. He is always dressed like shit. It&#039;s not the same black man every day. Do I think every black person does this? Of course not, I&#039;m in the top 5 GPA of my program and one of the people above me is a black girl. <br>Race realism and the mindset that usually comes with it just supports collectivism. Collectivism is the reason for black culture and all that shitty music on the subway. I have nothing against race mixing, or immigration or anything of the sort. I&#039;m against seeing yourself as your race. If I wear to write a 10,000 page autobiography I likely wouldn&#039;t mentioned I&#039;m white until page 4,000. <br><br>I know it&#039;s not the same thing as race realism, but it&#039;s very similar.","time":1492061299,"resto":120867771,"id":"0kFe9E9R","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120872757,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)01:29:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120867771\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120867771<\/a><br>Really makes me think","filename":"Horseshoe+theory+for+beginners+credit+to+known+criminal+sam+hyde_9b16e0_6059835","ext":".jpg","w":900,"h":792,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":110,"tim":1492061354441,"time":1492061354,"md5":"NsOvQcrdtoowP0OWKuKP1Q==","fsize":73824,"resto":120867771,"id":"6UcMj0aJ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120872770,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)01:29:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120867771\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120867771<\/a><br><br>You are a faggot obviously, like a handful of you tube celebrities could somehow make a movement wrong.<br><br>Again your obviously a faggot or a shill. for thinking what youy do.<br><br>but there is nothing wrong with the center.<br><br>faggot.","filename":"1477123184954","ext":".jpg","w":344,"h":291,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":105,"tim":1492061362742,"time":1492061362,"md5":"2WbACEMrmzhR+UgjSKjX0w==","fsize":29929,"resto":120867771,"id":"\/Xqw\/YLw","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120872813,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)01:29:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120869370\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120869370<\/a><br>You idiot.

Just hearing those apes through that thin line of stomach made me clench my fists, I even tried to strangle myself with the cord once. That moment when I was delivered by a black person I was like pls put me back in, KEEP THE APES AWAY. So after about 10 years in this ape infested jungle I began to study these &quot;apes&quot; closely and came to the astounding conclusion that no matter how hard they try, deep down there will always be a little bit of ape hidden in their small little minds. After I realized that death was the only way to truly escape the &quot;jungle&quot; was death. This sent me into a deep depression. How can I make them go away? Why don&#039;t they act like us? I asked myself these questions countless times every day and still can&#039;t figure out why. After countless studies I concluded that maybe it&#039;s in their nature because they were oppressed in slavery for so many years. Maybe they can&#039;t help it. But then I see the albino apes mimicking their actions. Why would you aspire to be something so useless. Maybe they wanted to fit in. Maybe they were oppressed in another life. These &quot;apes&quot; have invaded and destroyed everything I have of known to love. Ok I can&#039;t go on anymore. shots self.","filename":"1","ext":".jpg","w":1026,"h":770,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1490399282374,"time":1490399282,"md5":"lxcZXvLaKZ\/1yLHGA7Dj+w==","fsize":41207,"resto":0,"id":"GQ64Upyu","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"racial-problems","country_name":"United States","replies":3,"images":0,"unique_ips":4},{"no":118153235,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)19:49:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"Lmao","time":1490399389,"resto":118152992,"id":"BTjA5PI1","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118153249,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)19:49:56","name":";)","com":"lol ED rawr","time":1490399396,"resto":118152992,"id":"paqSDNeu","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118153489,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)19:51:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"this is bound to become pasta","time":1490399507,"resto":118152992,"id":"ilKXJTES","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

Please pardon the autism.<br>http:\/\/archive.is\/75JQ4<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Chaos Magic as the True Duginist Weltanschauung<\/span><br>&quot;The misanthropic ideas of British occultist and satanist Aleister Crowley (d. 1947) do however inform both the Duginist world view and its contemporary praxis. Indeed it is within the worldview of Chaos magic specifically (which is a spawn of Crowley\u2019s Thelemic philosophy) where much of the paradoxes and seeming contradictions of the Duginist weltanschauung \u2013 and especially in its Fourth Positionist catchall of \u2018beyond right or left\u2019 \u2013 must be sought, since this is (whether explicitly articulated or not) the actual animating locus of the Duginist far-right praxis, beginning with its choice of symbology, i.e. his Eurasian flag of eight white or yellow thunderbolts (or arrows) shaped in a radial pattern and set behind a black background. This symbol by itself is alternatively referred to in Chaos magic as the \u2018wheel of chaos\u2019\u2026\u201d<br>Can some helpful anons help me to connect the dots on the bizarre material that is The Fourth Political Theory?<br>Ok so we see the 8 pointed wheel all over alt-right and traditionalist spheres. Trad Youth uses it and Heimbach is a self-confessed Duginphile. Now - the Richard Spencer connection is what really interests me. His wife, a Russian Eurasianist is a translator to Dugin. Obvious link. Spencer himself embraces \/pol\/&#039;s own symbol of CHAOS on his lapel and actually gets clocked while describing its significance to a reporter. (Bit of a chaotic occurrence, eh?) Then we have the infamous pic with him and the Bushes. Granny Bush is a descendent of Crowley, no? <br>Is there a syndicate harnessing the powers of chaos to break apart liberal capitalism&#039;s grip on the world? Is it something more sinister?<br>I know this is all a bit schizo - hoping for some input.","filename":"19993287532","ext":".jpg","w":1868,"h":1204,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":161,"tim":1493476328478,"time":1493476328,"md5":"\/3kKGCMeBgl80cE03kDoJA==","fsize":930598,"resto":0,"id":"YrDomEWK","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"dugin-chaos-magick-kek-and-you","country_name":"United States","replies":15,"images":5,"unique_ips":9},{"no":123338736,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)10:36:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123338363\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123338363<\/a><br>I&#039;ve read that article.

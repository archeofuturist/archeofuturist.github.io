To equate a potential with an actual, is vicious; to advocate the sacrifice of the latter to the former, is unspeakable. . . . Observe that by ascribing rights to the unborn, i.e., the nonliving, the anti-abortionists obliterate the rights of the living: the right of young people to set the course of their own lives. The task of raising a child is a tremendous, lifelong responsibility, which no one should undertake unwittingly or unwillingly. Procreation is not a duty: human beings are not stock-farm animals. For conscientious persons, an unwanted pregnancy is a disaster; to oppose its termination is to advocate sacrifice, not for the sake of anyone\u2019s benefit, but for the sake of misery qua misery, for the sake of forbidding happiness and fulfillment to living human beings.","filename":"ayn-rand-1957c","ext":".jpg","w":650,"h":675,"tn_w":120,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490052367695,"time":1490052367,"md5":"h9QoLKjL0LkQIotVwgT9kQ==","fsize":266337,"resto":117537116,"id":"fBy76gqw","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":117549779,"now":"03\/20\/17(Mon)19:26:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117549747\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117549747<\/a><br>That was just the taigs.","time":1490052369,"resto":117537116,"id":"9pGvpdd5","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":117549797,"now":"03\/20\/17(Mon)19:26:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117549453\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117549453<\/a><br><a href=\"#p117549495\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117549495<\/a><br>Lads, I know you&#039;re newfags but don&#039;t reply to the Randian Autist.","time":1490052378,"resto":117537116,"id":"dqDmXob5","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":117549819,"now":"03\/20\/17(Mon)19:26:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"My bicep is tired like I&#039;ve been working out.<br><br>Do you lads ever spend so much time on 4chan, all day every day, that the micro movements of using a mouse build up over time into bicep exercise?","time":1490052389,"resto":117537116,"id":"ktr9fNc4","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":117549847,"now":"03\/20\/17(Mon)19:26:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117549752\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117549752<\/a><br>So let me get this straight, not only do you want to fuck kids you also want to murder them?

Houses being more expensive should mean that its even more profitable to turn a patch of land and a pile of bricks into a domicile. The opposite of that is happening because there is no free market in housing, because it would make housing too cheap and available which people hate once they already have a home.<br><br>You can see &quot;save our greenbelt&quot; protests all around the country now, even though the government has only slightly encouraged house building, even though all those homeowners complaining live on houses that were once built on a &quot;greenbelt&quot;. It&#039;s mob rule and selfishness.

This is the caveman\u2019s version of the doctrine of innate ideas\u2014or of inherited knowledge\u2014which has been thoroughly refuted by philosophy and science.

My home area is 80%+ non-white and if you took young white Brits under 30 you&#039;re looking at under 5%.<br>I work in a wealthy part of London tho and suddenly it&#039;s 80-90% white, and non-whites\/non-Brits are massively more likely to do menial or service jobs. <br><br>Think if more Brits moved to London to work we&#039;d need far less immigration desu. <br><br>I know most of you won&#039;t, but think of the bigger picture here. It&#039;s a sacrifice I like to think I&#039;ve made. I&#039;m more useful here (I make much more than I ever could outside - and I voluntarily live below my means to save money).","time":1490055065,"resto":117537116,"id":"ESaQawOm","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":117556257,"now":"03\/20\/17(Mon)20:11:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/117556151#p117556151\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117556151<\/a><br><br>NEW<br><br><a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/117556151#p117556151\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117556151<\/a><br><br><a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/117556151#p117556151\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117556151<\/a><br><br><a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/117556151#p117556151\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117556151<\/a><br><br><a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/117556151#p117556151\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117556151<\/a><br><a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/117556151#p117556151\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117556151<\/a><br><a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/117556151#p117556151\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117556151<\/a>","time":1490055068,"resto":117537116,"id":"LU7ClqRw","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":117556509,"now":"03\/20\/17(Mon)20:13:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117555936\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117555936<\/a><br>I&#039;ve got no idea what r9k is<br>If that is true then 4chan is healing families one thread at a time.","time":1490055185,"resto":117537116,"id":"ATwV+2S9","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":117556527,"now":"03\/20\/17(Mon)20:13:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117554968\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117554968<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; 1) Have the resources and capacity as a society to care for the weak.<\/span><br><br>Mass unemployment.

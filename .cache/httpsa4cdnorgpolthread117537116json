To equate a potential with an actual, is vicious; to advocate the sacrifice of the latter to the former, is unspeakable. . . . Observe that by ascribing rights to the unborn, i.e., the nonliving, the anti-abortionists obliterate the rights of the living: the right of young people to set the course of their own lives. The task of raising a child is a tremendous, lifelong responsibility, which no one should undertake unwittingly or unwillingly. Procreation is not a duty: human beings are not stock-farm animals. For conscientious persons, an unwanted pregnancy is a disaster; to oppose its termination is to advocate sacrifice, not for the sake of anyone\u2019s benefit, but for the sake of misery qua misery, for the sake of forbidding happiness and fulfillment to living human beings.","filename":"ayn-rand-1957c","ext":".jpg","w":650,"h":675,"tn_w":120,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490052367695,"time":1490052367,"md5":"h9QoLKjL0LkQIotVwgT9kQ==","fsize":266337,"resto":117537116,"id":"fBy76gqw","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":117549779,"now":"03\/20\/17(Mon)19:26:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117549747\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117549747<\/a><br>That was just the taigs.","time":1490052369,"resto":117537116,"id":"9pGvpdd5","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":117549797,"now":"03\/20\/17(Mon)19:26:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117549453\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117549453<\/a><br><a href=\"#p117549495\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117549495<\/a><br>Lads, I know you&#039;re newfags but don&#039;t reply to the Randian Autist.","time":1490052378,"resto":117537116,"id":"dqDmXob5","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":117549819,"now":"03\/20\/17(Mon)19:26:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"My bicep is tired like I&#039;ve been working out.<br><br>Do you lads ever spend so much time on 4chan, all day every day, that the micro movements of using a mouse build up over time into bicep exercise?","time":1490052389,"resto":117537116,"id":"ktr9fNc4","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":117549847,"now":"03\/20\/17(Mon)19:26:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117549752\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117549752<\/a><br>So let me get this straight, not only do you want to fuck kids you also want to murder them?

Houses being more expensive should mean that its even more profitable to turn a patch of land and a pile of bricks into a domicile. The opposite of that is happening because there is no free market in housing, because it would make housing too cheap and available which people hate once they already have a home.<br><br>You can see &quot;save our greenbelt&quot; protests all around the country now, even though the government has only slightly encouraged house building, even though all those homeowners complaining live on houses that were once built on a &quot;greenbelt&quot;. It&#039;s mob rule and selfishness.

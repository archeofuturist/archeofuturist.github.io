You can&#039;t undo identity politics. You can&#039;t undo feminism. You can&#039;t undo globalism. You can&#039;t undo colleges becoming Marxist indoctrination camps. You can&#039;t undo our centuries-long descent into degeneracy. Any conservative &quot;victory&quot; we have just slightly delays the inevitable. Society is corrupt to the very core and there is simply no saving it. George Soros could keel over and die as I&#039;m writing this post and it wouldn&#039;t change a damn thing because there are a thousand George Soroses waiting to take his place. The liberals won. The globalists won. Those of you holding out for some fantasy golden age day of the rope scenario that will make everything right again are in denial and frankly I envy you because at least you have hope, no matter how unfounded and impossible.","filename":"1470951652603","ext":".jpg","w":653,"h":490,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1491511205711,"time":1491511205,"md5":"arVslUu\/QKBJ5l5gc+Ypwg==","fsize":99082,"resto":0,"id":"svLVOged","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-world-is-a-lost-cause-i-know-many-of-you-dont","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":119791817,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)16:43:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119791286\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119791286<\/a><br>Could people stop making threads every 36 seconds?

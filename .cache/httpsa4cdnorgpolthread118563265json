Like the legitimate ones who were born with ambiguous genitalia, not the degenerate trannies and homos. Yes, I know that technically they fall under the umbrella of the lgbtqaiiaatspxyz community, but they are legitimately genetically compromised, an actual physical symptom and not in their head.","filename":"FB_IMG_1490648769909","ext":".jpg","w":750,"h":750,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490649349982,"time":1490649349,"md5":"z8JyEbmjfEvQSVboHBUCtA==","fsize":46973,"resto":0,"id":"QOqp4ap6","country":"IE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"what-are-your-thoughts-on-hermaphrodites-like-the","country_name":"Ireland","replies":4,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":118563475,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)17:17:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118563265\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118563265<\/a><br>They are a rarity.

So fungus or frogs that seem male but lay viable eggs are examples. Intersex has all sorts of presentations and over 50 known types and known causes, some of which having little to no detectable traits, externally or even via a simple blood test. You often have to look at the sex chromosomes to figure it out. I have two friends who have Kleinfelders a type of intersex and one transitioned to become a woman and the other stayed a dude. I can&#039;t really say which one is happier, but my overall point is that intersex being being lumped into LGBT has only been happening the past 10 years or so. Before that it was all about the patient&#039;s health and happiness, which meant they were suggested to follow the cultural and social (and biological) sexual dimorphism standards which have been established in mammals and is clear thru literally the entire animal kingdom. <br><br>I am kind of an expert on this topic as well as topics like endocrine disruptors and &quot;transgenderism&quot; which is both a mental disorder as well as a culture. Ask me anything, anon. And no I am not trans nor am I intersex. I am fairly beta but trying to work on it.","time":1490649925,"resto":118563265,"id":"f+hid2yK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118564640,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)17:28:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118564393\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118564393<\/a><br>Hey dude thanks for the input..it&#039;s insightful","time":1490650089,"resto":118563265,"id":"QOqp4ap6","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"}]}

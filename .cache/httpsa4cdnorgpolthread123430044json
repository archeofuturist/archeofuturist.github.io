He is unfailingly polite and unrelentingly earnest, refraining from weighing in on news stories due to his while male privilege, as if he were a judge recusing himself from a court case. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Yet upon closer inspection, this man reveals himself to be something other than he appears. At first, the signs are small \u2014 a passing reference to his love for Bill Maher here, a vaguely misogynistic tweet about Kellyanne Conway or Chelsea Clinton on his Twitter timeline there.

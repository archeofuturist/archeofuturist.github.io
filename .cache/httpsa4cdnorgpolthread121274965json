Folks on our side are not going to be recording because of police seizing it and such, but we know their side loves to broadcast their stuff. So if you record it we can analyze it at a later time to see we need to fix our tactics or can better prepare ourselves. This is not a call for doxxxing because we know that is a very bad no-no activity, but if you see evidence of a crime maybe Berkeley PD or other crime fighters will want to know about it.<br><br>If you can figure out which livestreamers are which, and they happen to be attempting to doxx or otherwise harass us (they were attempting to do this during the Milo event as well as the March 4th event), you might be able to notify some of us on twitter so that we can avoid them and better defend ourselves. In the same way, you can attempt to listen in on BPD and CHP scanners to see if they have plans to move in and start cracking our heads.<br><br>Real time meme creation, within hours of the last Berkeley rumble the fash was turning their meme production into overdrive, we could do the same, as well as hijacking and subverting the memes they will surely be making. We&#039;ve seen how the far-right loves to try and recreate our own memes against us (anti-anti-fa, anti-communist action, goodnight left side etc), what if we did the same, just a simple photoshop to change basedStickman into an AntiFa and just shit like that to take the wind out of their meme-sails.<br><br>Keep your eye on internet crowd sourcing for Legal fees and hospital bills. Last time they set up &quot;Legal funds&quot; for AntiFas arrested but ended up keeping it all. Try to sniff out which ones are legit or not and spread the word.<br><br>I&#039;ll be at the park tomorrow, keep us safe reddit, you&#039;re our only hope.","filename":"anar","ext":".jpg","w":1005,"h":556,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":138,"tim":1492296804069,"time":1492296804,"md5":"2YXDmGv3aaMEjInZde0BzQ==","fsize":56870,"resto":0,"id":"xbqRffuS","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"everyone-here-can-help-out-our-berkeley-comrades","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

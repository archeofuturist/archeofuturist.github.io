And women are at grave risk.<br><br>President Trump, Speaker Ryan and House Republicans are hell-bent on repealing this historic law, and their new bill is a total sham that betrays women and families.<br><br>The U.S. House of Representatives is scheduled to vote tomorrow on the health care repeal bill, so we must stand strong and stop them in their tracks.<br><br>Here\u2019s why:<br>- The health care repeal bill would wreak havoc on our health care system;<br><br>- It would cause 24 million people to lose health coverage by 2026;<br><br>- It would drive up the cost of health care and provide inadequate coverage;<br><br>- It would defund Planned Parenthood, denying 2.5 million people access to care;<br><br>- It would slash Medicaid, resulting in less coverage and fewer services for those who are most in need;<br><br>- It would expand already harmful abortion coverage restrictions, denying women the care they need;<br><br>- It would cut off access to care, particularly for low-income women and women of color; and<br><br>- It would provide unconscionable tax breaks to big corporations and the super wealthy.<br><br>That\u2019s exactly why the Republican health care repeal bill is opposed by key health care stakeholders \u2014 including the American Medical Association, American Hospital Association, the American Nurses Association, AARP and many others. <br><br>It\u2019s totally unacceptable, and we cannot let them get away with it.","filename":"Congress_Health_Overhaul_64489.jpg-08470","ext":".jpg","w":3370,"h":2280,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":169,"tim":1490217807362,"time":1490217807,"md5":"SftXU7bICO2enhVv6O5bLQ==","fsize":3837608,"resto":0,"id":"38tIfoT+","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"were-in-the-fight-of-our-lives-and-thats-no","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":117829204,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)17:26:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"Too bad.","time":1490217983,"resto":117828748,"id":"EDgG5G4B","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117829598,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)17:29:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"Tits or gtfo","time":1490218140,"resto":117828748,"id":"Q3JVRzNJ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

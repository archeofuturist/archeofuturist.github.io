Nobody can deny that Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East, for example, are doing much worse than the West and East Asia, even if the reason can be disputed. Even if we take out the Middle East and Africa from the equation because perhaps foreign intervention and historical colonialism could be seen as the root of the problem, why is Latin America in such poor condition? If not for either an inferior culture, an inferior average IQ, or a combination of the two, what else would cause them to be so far behind Western nations in almost if not every measure?","filename":"Percent_poverty_world_map","ext":".png","w":1350,"h":657,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":121,"tim":1490082364212,"time":1490082364,"md5":"R2+ymRppCypaqJ8\/zxR34w==","fsize":21324,"resto":0,"id":"JueHFiO4","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"heres-a-question-to-pose-to-people-who-are-both","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

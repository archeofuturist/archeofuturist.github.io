I believe he is letting them have this victory so he can argue for his budget he has full control over in September. <br><br>Luckily he was able to get some more spending to the military and border patrol but not much. <br><br>I dont like him appealing to the democrats but he has fought with them alot since he started and they have been obstructing everything he does regardless of if it&#039;s beneficial in a bipartisan way. <br><br>I don&#039;t know why he allowed such a shitty budget and will likely sign it but the tweet today shows he is not happy about it. <br><br>Reminder that it needs 60% approval from congress when it could easily pass if it was changed to 51% approval. <br><br>The irony is the democrats say he is changing the rules when this could benefit the republicans and democrats in the long run. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;inb4 Drumpf<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;inb4 Redditt shill<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;inb4 go back to T_D<\/span><br><br>Just want to have a discussion on this. I don&#039;t like the decision he is making but it looks like he is trying to appease the democrats before he goes full nuclear on them for HIS budget in September. <br><br>Remeber the democrats still can&#039;t even figure out who is leading their party, they will take any victory they can get and the media shows its cheerleading them on as well.","filename":"1493734278303","ext":".png","w":605,"h":713,"tn_w":212,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493736691408,"time":1493736691,"md5":"Srg1nDm7mI702Mjt2c07\/g==","fsize":488405,"resto":0,"id":"VXSaL2zw","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"i-think-i-know-why-trump-let-he-democrats-have","country_name":"United States","replies":22,"images":3,"unique_ips":13},{"no":123775625,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)11:00:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"I don&#039;t see it as trump going back on his promises either I see this as a delay. <br><br>Now if he can&#039;t get a budget together like how he promised for september, I would probably join the ranks of the shills about him but the situation he is in is tricky since the democrats are trying to get moderate conservatives and otgers cuckservatives to turn against trump.<br><br>This is no doubt a loss for Trump and Republicans but I think this is a loss he is taking so he can gamble for tax reform with the democrats.

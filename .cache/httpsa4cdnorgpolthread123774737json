I believe he is letting them have this victory so he can argue for his budget he has full control over in September. <br><br>Luckily he was able to get some more spending to the military and border patrol but not much. <br><br>I dont like him appealing to the democrats but he has fought with them alot since he started and they have been obstructing everything he does regardless of if it&#039;s beneficial in a bipartisan way. <br><br>I don&#039;t know why he allowed such a shitty budget and will likely sign it but the tweet today shows he is not happy about it. <br><br>Reminder that it needs 60% approval from congress when it could easily pass if it was changed to 51% approval. <br><br>The irony is the democrats say he is changing the rules when this could benefit the republicans and democrats in the long run. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;inb4 Drumpf<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;inb4 Redditt shill<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;inb4 go back to T_D<\/span><br><br>Just want to have a discussion on this.

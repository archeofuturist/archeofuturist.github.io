Btw, this isn&#039;t the design i have, just a quick Google search pic. These can be easily built with a disposable camera and a bit of know-how. The ones built with a large capacitor and 1 big burst are better than small rapid burst ones. Plenty of DIY videos on jewtube. Mine, built using a disposable camera&#039;s flash capacitor, will brick any Android and reset iphones up to 10 ft. It also fucked up my voltmeter from across the room. For obvious reasons, i don&#039;t have footage of it in action and my phone is going nowhere near it (incase of accidental discharge).","filename":"mqdefault","ext":".jpg","w":320,"h":180,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1493180534796,"time":1493180534,"md5":"ESESoqGCpfP\/3u0jgTDZNg==","fsize":14462,"resto":122837972,"id":"iNlMXjQJ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

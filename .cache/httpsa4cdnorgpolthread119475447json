The media will attack those other sites as well and try to kill them off and could succeed. If they can take out Youtube\/Google (a giant) they would easily take out the others.<br><br>No, we the people need to go after the source. Wall Street Journal, Buzzfeed, London Times, etc. We need to compile a list of organizations and SPECIFIC people involved and bring the hate and anger to them directly. Make them fear for their very lives. Don&#039;t actually threaten their lives, but we need to compile a massive list and organize a campaign against them. We need to make them see the anger and let it be in their mind that they will likely lose their livelihood (viewers\/readers\/etc) and more. <br><br>Thoughts on this? Thoughts on making it more effective? Because this censorship on youtube is about as unAmerican of a policy as possible and free speech is important.

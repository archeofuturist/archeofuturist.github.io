The suburbs will perish and be replaced, making way for either megalopolises or large swaths of rural life.<br>If you think the socio-economic and political divide is bad now, just you want. Once white flights kick in and we dominate the rural regions (areas of grey in pic related) while minorities remain in the cities once again (whites will still live in the cities, but few minorities will live in the grey areas).<br><br>With advancements in technology and political challenges we&#039;ll face two distinctive worlds will be made.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The megaregion urban centers will be Cyberpunk.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The rural fillings will be Solarpunk.<\/span><br><br>The megaregions will contain most the crime, the poverty, the sickness, the filth.

Literal &quot;White Power Farms&quot; will crop up as the need for power in the urban centers will require generation from the rural areas, the same is true with food. Large corporations will attempt to maintain farms in the rural regions but eventually fail as they cannot maintain the supply. This supply shortage will cause high demand and the people in the rural areas will begin to raise livestock and gardens for food, eventually replacing the farms of old. New laws will be passed and soon the plentiful rural gardens will supply the food to the megaregions.<br><br>A second white flight will kick this off, and there&#039;s nothing the government can do to prevent it. The megaregional developments are logical when dealing with population density, but all of them are also led by the sjw-anti-white-faggotry we&#039;ve come to hate.

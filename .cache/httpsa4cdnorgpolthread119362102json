I should have been more careful but the damage is done. I told her to get an abortion, that I will pay for it. She won&#039;t do it. She want to have that child. I told her that kid is going to look like shit, and it&#039;s not worth it. She won&#039;t listen. She wants to have it. And she wants to marry obviously, but even without marriage it&#039;s still happening. With or without me. <br><br>So I guess that&#039;s over, huh \/pol\/? I mean, I always wanted to have kids, but with a white woman. Looks like the &quot;yellow fever&quot; got to me and I just contributed to the fall of the white race.","filename":"55","ext":".jpg","w":1234,"h":1522,"tn_w":202,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491244733699,"time":1491244733,"md5":"lI01mlhdAVxEqgPG2lA4lQ==","fsize":420547,"resto":0,"id":"Ig2QKZSZ","country":"PL","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"is-abortion-still-wrong-if-its-killing-a-children","country_name":"Poland","replies":1,"images":1,"unique_ips":2},{"no":119362871,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)14:44:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119362102\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119362102<\/a><br>S&#039;nothing you can do now m8.<br>If she&#039;s cute and you like her, I&#039;d say go for it, just try to not make an Elliot 2.0<br>You fucked up either way, so good luck with your half-chink.","filename":"1488332310156","ext":".jpg","w":800,"h":620,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":96,"tim":1491245083164,"time":1491245083,"md5":"vJ7OKFqZZo1v5nclweTljg==","fsize":33995,"resto":119362102,"id":"zO+EGVWA","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"}]}

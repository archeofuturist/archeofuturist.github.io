Primarily Europeans, and American pedophilia advocates (literally, no joke).<br><br>They&#039;re a militantly aggressive group of people who engage in political and financial aggression against private corporations.<br><br>They lure people into using long viral licenses full of lawyer speak, letting people think they have control and ownership over their projects and are just letting other people see the code, but in reality they have given up almost all rights to it. If you let anyone else contribute to it, you can no longer change your own code license to privatize your own work without removing all traces. And even then you&#039;ll probably get accusations of license violations.<br><br>Proof of their cult-like ways is that they even attack people with truly free licenses, where they freely give away code for anyone to use for any purposes, even allowing corporations to take it and use it. They claim that such a license violates their rights in some completely ridiculous mental gymnastics. <br><br>Only long viral licenses are &quot;truly free&quot; according to them. <br><br>Communists should be fought in all forms.

One of the hallmarks of modern physics is quantum theory, which gave rise to modern solid state physics. One of the direct consequences was that we found energy in many systems becomes discrete as you probe the system at smaller and smaller length scales. In fact, we often discuss quanta as the smallest unit of a measurable quantity, e.g., the quantum of electric charge, e, or of energy, a photon, or of magnetic flux. Matter is inherently discrete at the smallest of scales, i.e., the energy levels in an atom or the energy bands in a crystal, which are themselves made up of a large number of finite-spaced energy levels. We have become exceedingly adept at detecting and manipulating these discrete quantities. Adam needs to fuck off with his pseudo scientific sounding drivel. It doesn&#039;t make sense from an everyday standpoint, and it certainly doesn&#039;t make sense from a scientific standpoint.

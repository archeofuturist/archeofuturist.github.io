Masculinity is so foreign to them and they have a cartoonish idea of what it actually is (which we&#039;re seeing play out by what feminism focuses on). They actually think they can socialise muslim men from all over the middle east, so therefore they should be allowed to flood Europe and every other western country as a form of &quot;enrichment&quot;. Most of these men are unsocialised animals in comparison and won&#039;t give up their masculinity so passively. It took women a fucking long time, collectively, to condition men to be the way we are now. Their overconfidence deludes them into thinking muslim men will offer up their nuts in some kind of &#039;trade&#039; for freedom. Of course they won&#039;t wage war from within and attempt to conquer and subvert from within! There&#039;s absolutely no chance of that happening! Especially since leftists make sure muslims can get away with pretty much whatever they want (because it&#039;s islamophobic, white supremacist and xenophobic to say be critical of muslims)<br><br>Feminists don&#039;t understand masculinity and how much men &#039;perform&#039; to please women. They think they have it hard, and are so blind slighted that they don&#039;t realise the average man has it worse than the average woman.<br><br>Muslim men haven&#039;t been through the same conditioning as most men living in the west, they can&#039;t be controlled and won&#039;t give a fuck about feminist and PC &#039;rules&#039; because they&#039;re so foreign. Western men are worried about this because it won&#039;t end well, but so many women naively think men from conflicting cultures with almost no crossover traditions can co-exist no worries. Really showing their naivety to tribal warfare.<br><br>Women want to tame the beast, but only men understand how dangerous the beast really is. Women don&#039;t &#039;see&#039; masculinity for what it actually is","filename":"htUZA2t","ext":".png","w":576,"h":833,"tn_w":172,"tn_h":249,"tim":1491278067583,"time":1491278067,"md5":"oek1TDgSENH4cwsSiafudw==","fsize":857950,"resto":0,"id":"TV8GxRVA","country":"AU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"do-you-think-feminists-and-many-leftist-women","country_name":"Australia","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

Nivea, Coca Cola, Samsung (korean, but the ad made in USA), and so on.<br><br>And I noticed something they ALL have in common: ALL of them no exception are full of degeneracy. Literally every american ad has an explicit feminist reference (targeted to women, telling them how oppressed they are or even literally Femen looking protestors), male homosexuals and lesbians as well, niggers ALWAYS (in fact not only niggers, there are always at least a white, a black, an indian, a mexican, an asian, etc), references to globalization, and so on.<br><br>I noticed this since the past although it was more subtle. Now I&#039;ve been paying attention to the details and &quot;subliminal&quot; elements in the ads and it&#039;s fully explicit, genuinely disturbing. Some locally filmed ads for foreign products also started featuring the same crap.<br><br>WTF murricans, I thought it was an exaggeration but it looks like for real your media is full blown on brainwashing. And I don&#039;t mean &quot;oh look the ad has a female lawyer, that&#039;s feminist&quot; I mean full explicit propaganda.

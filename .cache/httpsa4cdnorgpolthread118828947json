South Sudan, formed after splitting from the north in 2011, has declared a famine in parts of the country where 100,000 people are said to be facing starvation. The UN refugee agency UNHCR was initially expecting 60,000 South Sudanese refugees to arrive in Sudan in the whole of 2017, but that figure has already been exceeded in the first three months. Aid groups have denounced a \u201cman-made\u201d famine caused by bloodshed in South Sudan where civil war has forced people to flee, disrupted agriculture and cut off aid agencies from some of the worst-hit areas.

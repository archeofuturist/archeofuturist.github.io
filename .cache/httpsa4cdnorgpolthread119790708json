Capitalism is pregnant with fascism. Russia and China are already fascist, and India and the USA are becoming fascist quickly. Fascism is inevitable at this point.<br><br>American Fascism will be pro-Jewish and pro-Israel, but anti-Mexican and anti-black enough to keep the rural and suburban whites happy. It will be more like Italian Fascism than NSDAP fascism. American Fascism will not call itself fascism, but it&#039;s still fascism. The Patriot Act was the beginning of the end. Invading Syria is fascist imperialism and the invasion will prove that America is a de facto one party state. <br><br>Our dream of a prosperous and safe Fortress America is dead.

Again, do you believe the nonsense to &quot;civilize&quot; them. Nonsense. Do you think the British East India Company gave a fuck about civilizing a bunch of retards thousands of miles away when at the time we couldn&#039;t even civilize our Irish friends? We went there to strip the country of its resources pure and simple. We deliberately destroyed their indigenous textile cottage industry and instead decreed that they had to sell us their cotton for barely anything so that we could fill our textile factories in Manchester. Then once we created those textiles, we sold them back to India for 10x what it would otherwise have cost them. The military presence in India was to enforce this decree. <br><br>The entire colonization, from the British East India Company to the British Raj was for economic exploitation, nothing else. I&#039;m not saying that this was immoral at the time; they would have done the exact same thing to Europe if they had the power projection capabilities. Times were different then. But let&#039;s not pretend we went there to build infrastructure and help them out. We did build infrastructure like railways etc. but that was purely for our own interests. We completely stripped them economically and they went from being ~20% of the global economy to around 2% in a 100 years (although that was partly due to the industrial revolution in Europe and India&#039;s failure to keep up)\/<br><br>Before you chimp out, I&#039;m not saying that Britain shouldn&#039;t have maintained its empire, neither am I saying that British rule had no positive effects and I&#039;m not saying that India would have had a world beating economy.

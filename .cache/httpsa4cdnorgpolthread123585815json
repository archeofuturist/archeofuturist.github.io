I fly home every few weeks for time off. I don&#039;t have many friends. It&#039;s really hard to make friends. I feel sad a lot of the time because of that. It&#039;s also hard for me to like many people, they annoy me or don&#039;t live up to my expectations of a friend. I&#039;m quite introverted. <br>What makes it worse is I&#039;m in my mid 30s. Sometimes I cry because of it. No one at work knows how I feel about this, and none of my family do either.<br><br>How do I make friends when I&#039;m already this old and so picky about who I spend time with?

I fly home every few weeks for time off. I don&#039;t have many friends. It&#039;s really hard to make friends. I feel sad a lot of the time because of that. It&#039;s also hard for me to like many people, they annoy me or don&#039;t live up to my expectations of a friend. I&#039;m quite introverted. <br>What makes it worse is I&#039;m in my mid 30s. Sometimes I cry because of it. No one at work knows how I feel about this, and none of my family do either.<br><br>How do I make friends when I&#039;m already this old and so picky about who I spend time with? I&#039;m not autistic, just really depressed.","filename":"IMG_2859","ext":".jpg","w":470,"h":313,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1493618301428,"time":1493618301,"md5":"2uc9ypFV1AazLEiMuccHxQ==","fsize":15355,"resto":0,"id":"bWYEFyrp","country":"AU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"loneliness","country_name":"Australia","replies":2,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":123585898,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)01:59:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"This thread has been approved. <br><br>Posting is now open","time":1493618371,"resto":123585815,"id":"SwKCA1r5","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123585920,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)01:59:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"im down to be your friend, kik me sebasEs10","time":1493618389,"resto":123585815,"id":"X6dUE\/Ty","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

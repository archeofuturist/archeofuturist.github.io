Apparently my son mentioned being hit today at school, and the staff took it upon themselves to report child abuse. <br><br>Conversation went something like this:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;We have a report of physical child abuse from your son at school. He said &quot;My dad hits me sometimes at home&quot;.<\/span><br>Well, yes. I do occasionally hit my son. It&#039;s only when he is having a tantrum and hits either me or his mother in anger.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;So you respond by hitting him?<\/span><br>Of course.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Don&#039;t you think that a verbal warning would be a better option?<\/span><br>No. That doesn&#039;t get the message across. What that means to me is that violence is never acceptable ever. Which isn&#039;t true. I don&#039;t like violence, and I would like to avoid it if possible, but in the real world it is sometimes necessary. That&#039;s just a fact of life. Instead, the lesson I try to get across is &quot;Don&#039;t hit someone unless you&#039;re willing to be hit back&quot;.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Have you ever hit him out of anger?<\/span><br>Once. When he was riding his skateboard in the house, which we have told him hundreds of times not to do, and he broke my TV. And in that case, I smacked him on the cheek, with an open hand, and he punched me right back. And I am proud of him for that actually. <br><br><br>Rest of it was generic questions if I use alcohol and drugs and what not. Why is it that our society is so pussified that physical discipline is so feared? Those teachers are my age, and I am sure they got the belt TONS of times from their parents. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Picture unrelated<\/span>","filename":"portland25n-1-web","ext":".jpg","w":1200,"h":1499,"tn_w":200,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491289358392,"time":1491289358,"md5":"8JOSBv6w7zBxX7CPOy+Fpw==","fsize":81554,"resto":0,"id":"wWPIsyOi","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"so-pol-i-got-cps-called-on-me-today-apparently-my","country_name":"United States","replies":9,"images":0,"unique_ips":8},{"no":119443232,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)03:04:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"Punch your wife&#039;s son for being such a snitch.","time":1491289446,"resto":119443112,"id":"XBXNqf7l","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119443490,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)03:08:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119443232\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119443232<\/a><br>I dont think he was being a snitch.

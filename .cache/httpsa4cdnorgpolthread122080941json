No region showed a significant positive correlation between [grey matter] volume and [hours of porn]. Our findings indicated that [grey matter] volume of the right caudate of the striatum is smaller with higher pornography use. Our results of the sexual cue-reactivity paradigm show a negative correlation between [porn hours] and the left putamen activation during sex cues compared with fixation. This is in line with the hypothesis that intense exposure to pornographic stimuli results in a downregulation of the natural neural response to sexual stimuli. Striatum. This is called the \u201creward center\u201d of the brain. The reduced grey matter in this region translates to decreased pleasure and an unresponsive reward process. The person becomes desensitized to normal rewards.&quot;<br> <br>&quot;Using porn also increases production of other \u2018feel-good\u2019 chemicals in our brain, such as adrenaline, endorphins, and serotonin.

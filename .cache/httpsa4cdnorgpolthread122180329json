The Middle East is literally already a desert. Experts say that the region could become uninhabitable for human life within a few decades. The Syrian civil war could have been the first major conflict started by global warming, one of the reasons for the war was farmers moving into the cities because the drought was making it too hard to grow crops. So basically, about a billion mudslimes are going to be moving north over the next several decades.

They will have access to massive data sets and will be able to make intelligent conclusions without resorting to stupid impulses, and will make massive, stupid demographic problems or issues a non-problem for the most part, in what will be the ultimate form of a meritocratic authoritarian technocracy.<br><br>Additionally, genetic engineering will become a realizable and feasibly deployable technology for the majority of humans sometime in the intermediate future, meaning that we will be able to turn nearly all humans into high-quality, high-trust humans who are essentially analogues of intelligent, high-functioning white people and the societies they create.<br><br>The resulting world society will be quasi-fascist and meritocratic with key freedoms in the areas that matter, and although there will be hardships along the way this is how I believe the future will play out. You may think the world will be horrible, but think about it, things may just end up very much how we&#039;d like them to.","filename":"NordicBeauty2","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":500,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492880913188,"time":1492880913,"md5":"iIavStr2fSQjVPqnkeRW1w==","fsize":42619,"resto":0,"id":"WwZd8JTf","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"is-fascism-the-inevitable-future","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":122300938,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)13:21:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"No, machines will create TRUE communism","time":1492881710,"resto":122299376,"id":"QbuYLQTs","country":"PT","country_name":"Portugal"},{"no":122301140,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)13:23:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122299376\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122299376<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Believing the AI Jew<\/span>","time":1492881796,"resto":122299376,"id":"Dj1BK+Qa","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

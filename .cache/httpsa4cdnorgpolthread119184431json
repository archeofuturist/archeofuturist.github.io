It didn&#039;t happen so they are not nidding their time till the next big thing happens: namely the possible fall of the EU. The moment that happens, it&#039;s almost guaranteed that Catalonia will attempt to go their merry way, and in response, regardless of who is in power in Madrid, parts of the Spanish Army will move to stop the secession. Cue war.<br>- While populism in rich countries goes right, in poor countries like Spain or Greece it went left. We have a huge part of the population who happily identifies as far-left and are more than willing to go full Soviet Revolution if given the chance. If the EU falls, Spain will take one of two paths: Chile or Venezuela. Regardless of whether we get a Pinochet or a Chavez, there&#039;ll be war (a few decades ago we&#039;d have been more than happy to mimic France and call it day, but nowadays we look up more to Germany; if the EU falls is because Germany killed it and kicked us poor Southerners out, so we&#039;d be on our own).<br>- The Euro is the closest thing we had to an actual currency in the last century or so. No Euro means going back to Monopoly money-tier Peseta and that... that&#039;s bad. As in &quot;worse than 2012&quot; bad. Sure, we can regain our financial sovereignty and whatever other meme buzzwords you want to use, but for us that means insane inflation rates and almost yearly devaluations like we had in the 90s.<br><br>So yeah.

Their nationalist politicians are more than happy to let Catalonia take the first steps towards independence and catch all the flak.

Very few people on this earth act with purposeful intent, educate themselves, and find deep, lifelong fields of interest and succeed by the work of their own hands, and their own vision. We should be inspiring and educating as effective members of our society, regardless of political alignment. We should be instilling greater virtue in the people around us, not debasing ourselves in the way that reactionary, sheep-like organisms do. Or gouging ourselves with baseless hedonism. Or posting for hours on end in internet boards about why niggers should be systematically carpet bombed in every location on Earth.","filename":"1418492703115","ext":".gif","w":306,"h":469,"tn_w":163,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492370167530,"time":1492370167,"md5":"7fUSzRpgtIHMqkpVehBbmQ==","fsize":48011,"resto":0,"id":"lJETzQtj","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"why-isnt-individualism-the-guiding-principle-of","country_name":"United States","replies":8,"images":1,"unique_ips":8},{"no":121400740,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)15:27:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121399429\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121399429<\/a><br>Not everyone was born with the heroic spirit required for individualism.

The Orlando nightclub was a gun-free zone, so was Sandy Hook (I know, I know) so was the shooting at the DKR premiere. If you had a few properly trained people handling guns there, if you had some bullets firing the other way, maybe 50 people dead because 5 or 6 dead. Not perfect but that comes down to better vetting for 1) immigration and 2) who gets to have a gun.","time":1492385999,"resto":121436484,"id":"pL+MzYz\/","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":121439634,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)19:40:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121436484\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121436484<\/a><br>We understand, just dont care","time":1492386003,"resto":121436484,"id":"QwL1e89+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121439806,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)19:41:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"Every Canadian thread is bait thread because Justin Trudeau hired a team of professional shitposters to ruin \/pol\/ in early 2016.<br><br>Remember to sage and report ALL Canadian threads.","time":1492386067,"resto":121436484,"id":"sA9sMWCv","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121439860,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)19:41:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121437756\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121437756<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;country has guns<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;people get shot<\/span>","time":1492386086,"resto":121436484,"id":"b02PAoTg","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121440244,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)19:44:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"We are the civilized world, you join us","time":1492386244,"resto":121436484,"id":"2xJu\/jEB","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121441628,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)19:52:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"in the USA you are more likely to die from slip and fall in your bathtub than by an assault rifle","time":1492386725,"resto":121436484,"id":"LoObNbr7","country":"KR","country_name":"South Korea"},{"no":121441869,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)19:53:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121436484\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121436484<\/a>","filename":"1491362830314","ext":".jpg","w":533,"h":800,"tn_w":83,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492386807968,"time":1492386807,"md5":"KxHswi5OlUei\/eBgWsobug==","fsize":86838,"resto":121436484,"id":"cskX9PTP","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121442367,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)19:56:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121438593\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121438593<\/a><br>everyone in Switzerland (everyone means guys over 19) gets a rifle and no bullets \/ bolt that&#039;s to be locked in their home in case of war<br><br>it&#039;s pretty obvious that they don&#039;t have the same level of gun ownership as the US, and the arguments that gun nuts make about Switzerland and firearms are disingenuous as fuck","time":1492386977,"resto":121436484,"id":"JPvs+ReM","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121442692,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)19:58:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121436484\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121436484<\/a>","filename":"1465661239287","ext":".png","w":1671,"h":1105,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":82,"tim":1492387091428,"time":1492387091,"md5":"R+S3qvarXRPpV+uob4jU9Q==","fsize":475027,"resto":121436484,"id":"319aJClo","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

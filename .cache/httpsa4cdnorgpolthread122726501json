We mainly wanted to be left alone, to enjoy our video games, animu and other nerd culture shit in peace. Leftie faggots started tampering with our culture and policing us from multiple vectors. They policed our language, the things we could think or discuss, they shoehorned SJW bullshit into vidya and movies etc.<br><br>Anons hate being told what to do and it became clear they would not leave us alone. This pushed what was now \/pol\/ further right because it was clear that we needed the ideological strength to resist and fight this poisonous movement. It was them finally invading video games that did it imo. It was our last escape and we were essentially cornered culturally speaking.

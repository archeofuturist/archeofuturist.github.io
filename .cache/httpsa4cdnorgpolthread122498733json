It was this France that first expounded a civic nationalism, rejecting a nationalism of ethnicity, by incorporating Basques, Bretons, Prussians and other non-French people into a new French citizenry while Germany to her right expounded an ethnic nationalism that rejected unification with Austria to avoid the non-German peoples of the Austrian empire. <br><br>It was France in 1804 that issued the Napoleonic Code that enshrined these principles into law. It was this Napoleonic Code that spread worldwide and influences the law on practically every single continent today.<br><br>It was France in 1923 that invaded Germany and occupied the Ruhr, further humiliating the German people after forcing them to pay exorbitant reparations. It was this France that spurred the rise of the Nazis, whose war led to the deaths of millions of Europeans and the collapse of all European empires.<br><br>It was France in 1968 that birthed the new social movements that spread degeneracy throughout Europe, destroying the traditional family and killing the European birth rate.<br><br>It will be France in 2017 that proudly stands for the European Union, to finish the murder of the continent that she began in 1789.<br><br>The rot that has brought the West low was born in France and championed by the French people.<br><br>Why is this ignored? Why must this blighted nation persist?","filename":"1280px-Jacques_Bertaux_-_Prise_du_palais_des_Tuileries_-_1793","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":843,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":164,"tim":1492986177952,"time":1492986177,"md5":"yO7GCXLUd\/ojKXptA5P2qQ==","fsize":272230,"resto":0,"id":"4E8qRcNb","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"france-is-a-scourge-upon-the-west-and-deserves-to","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":122499281,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)18:26:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"1789 was the biggest mistake Western societies have ever made.","time":1492986413,"resto":122498733,"id":"lOwQaWEu","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122499510,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)18:28:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122498733\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122498733<\/a><br>You are right, the France is a shit country.

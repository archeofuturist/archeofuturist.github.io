It&#039;s clear that they are killing civilians and violating chemical weapons treaties, so why should we play the isolationist role? We clearly want to maintain our presence as a world superpower, as we have the military budget to stay that way. If we don&#039;t at least take a clear stance on being against increasingly aggressive and anti-humanitarian actions on behalf of the Syria-Russia-China coalition, how can we keep a check on their power? Sure, Trump probably should have gone through congress first, but I doubt that would have made much of a difference.

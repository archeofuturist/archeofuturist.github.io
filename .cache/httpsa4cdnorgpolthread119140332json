One was the deal that FOX reported on tonight and involves Nunes, where even before Trump was candidate there was surveillance and unmasking done either through Brennan or someone like Jeh Johnson at the indirect behest of Obama. That apparently yielded little to nothing. Then the Russia thing was brewed up hastily after Trump&#039;s press conference where he jokingly asked Russia to get Hillary&#039;s missing e-mails to the press. The second Russia op is where the FISA stuff comes in and is what produced the Flynn hit job material etc and so forth and is being run by &quot;deep state&quot; people in and out of government (like the Farkas woman). The first op reported on by FOX looks very much like the kind of general illegal surveillance described as Project Dragnet involving the CIA","time":1491018738,"resto":119140332,"id":"fTD8CDMp","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119140500,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)23:52:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119140332\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119140332<\/a><br>Coachanon is here to help you solve your problems.

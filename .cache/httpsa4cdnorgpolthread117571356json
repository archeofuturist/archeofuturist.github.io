She is anti-EU, anti-migrants and is for a &quot;strong State&quot;: she wants to increase public spendings towards the poorest, the elderly (go back to the retirement age at 60 (62 currently in France): she has a significant social agenda for France (which is already one of the most biggest-spending country in the world).<\/span><br>She plans for France a fight against islamism and to implement secular and security policies.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Emmanuel Macron is the pro-EU, pro-migrants and &quot;liberal&quot; candidate. He labels himself as the &quot;progressist&quot; candidate (in contrast with the conservatives). He is the one who is ready to &quot;cuckify&quot; (even more) France and was Fran\u00e7ois Hollande&#039;s economy minister. He is, according to him: &quot;neither from the right-wing, nor the left-wing&quot; and has created a new political party called &quot;En Marche !&quot; (&quot;In Motion&quot;, but more like &quot;Let&#039;s Move !&quot;)<\/span><br>He is backed by almost all the media and the &quot;system&quot; like Hillary Clinton was.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Fran\u00e7ois Fillon is the centre-right candidate from the traditional right-wing French Party.

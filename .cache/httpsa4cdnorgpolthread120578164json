Ivanka&#039;s advisor for years was Dina Powell. Dina Powell is friends with Valerie Jarrett, who literally lives with the Obamas right now. And now Dina Powell is U.S. Deputy National Security Advisor for Strategy to Donald Trump. <br><br>Dina Powell&#039;s husband is Richard Powell, president of Teneo, which has close ties to the Clinton Foundation -- Bill Clinton served as an advisor for Teneo. <br><br>Now take Jared Kushner, who took a $250m loan from George Soros. This is not even to mention Gary Cohn yet. <br><br>These are the people who got Flynn removed, and now they&#039;re going for Bannon. It&#039;s a fight for influence over Trump. <br><br>I am working on an OC piece showing the connections and tying it all together. <br><br>Everything I have said is verifiable, google the following:<br>&quot;Ivanka Trump Huma Abedin&quot;<br>&quot;Ivanka Trump Chelsea Clinton&quot;<br>&quot;Ivanka Trump Dina Powell&quot;<br>&quot;Dina Powell Gary Cohn&quot; <br>&quot;Dina Powell Valerie Jarrett&quot;<br>&quot;Jared Kushner George Soros&quot; <br>&quot;Teneo Clintons&quot;<br>&quot;Teneo Clinton Foundation&quot;<br>&quot;Richard Powell Clintons&quot;<br><br>Jared Kushner is STILL a registered democrat<br><br>All of these people are higher higher (yes I said it twice, they are way up there) ups at Goldmans, and globalists, and they&#039;ve been brought in by Jared Kushner and Ivanka, why do you think #FireKushner was trending? <br><br>Like I said, I am working on a brainstorm bubble plot showing all the connections<br><br>Google everything I said and you will find I am not wrong. Fuck this Syria strike, I might even agree with it for political posturing reasons, but google what I said and you will find the subversion. <br><br>The moment Bannon quits or is booted we know it&#039;s over. We can&#039;t lose this fight. We have to fight.<br><br>It&#039;s literally globalism vs nationalism and Bannon is one of the only people on our side.","filename":"Trump Washington","ext":".png","w":571,"h":644,"tn_w":221,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491903037113,"time":1491903037,"md5":"1pN+JEP4ECwz5ffX35D3hA==","fsize":729030,"resto":0,"id":"xZ527Ft9","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"we-need-to-save-trump","country_name":"United States","replies":26,"images":4,"unique_ips":12},{"no":120578262,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)05:32:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"Trump betrayed his people.<br>&quot;America first&quot;<br><br>Oh yeah so why do you go against North Korea and Syria you asshole?","time":1491903136,"resto":120578164,"id":"rmYcGBO3","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":120578366,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)05:33:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120578262\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120578262<\/a><br>So true.

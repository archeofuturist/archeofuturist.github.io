Note: I&#039;m talking (((capitalism))) not capitalism.<br>Jews are Communist, right? What they want is to make everyone Communist (though they call it Globalism and people call them Globalists, but regardless of the labels it&#039;s still Jews pushing Communism). We don&#039;t have actual capitalism because we use fiat money, therefore we have (((capitalism))). <br>Under capitalism there&#039;s a limited amount of whatever substance is used to back up the value of money (generally gold). If you take a risk with capitalism you actually lose money, which is what calculated risk is. If someone asks you for a loan and it was a stupid idea you wouldn&#039;t dream of borrowing them the money because you wouldn&#039;t get it back and you definitely wouldn&#039;t be getting any (((interest))) back.<br>So what&#039;s the difference between capitalism backed by gold and (((capitalism))) with fiat money? Well, you can borrow money to as many idiots as you like and if they can&#039;t pay it back it means nothing. In fact it&#039;s probably better if they can&#039;t pay it back because now they&#039;re indebted to you and the money you borrowed to them you can simply print off again because that&#039;s what fiat money is. Which means that (((you))) can never lose. If someone beats the odds and pays the money and your (((interest))) back great, if they don&#039;t nothing has been lost, not by (((you))) at least.<br>So these same people who do this, are the same people who control inflation and through that control wages. By pure coincidence they&#039;re the same ones who cry about the bourgeois (ironically the only people who listen are other members of the bourgeois who embarrassingly think they&#039;re proles). Who do they blame? What&#039;s the only way to combat this gulf in inequality between &quot;proles&quot; and the richest 1% of (((white guys)))? Communism.

Even the noted Catholic prelate and theologian, Cardinal Newman, tells us that Constantine introduced many things of pagan origin: &quot;We are told in various ways by Eusebius, that Constantine, in order to recommend the new religion to the heathen, transferred into it the outward ornaments to which they had been accustomed in their own...The use of temples, and these dedicated to particular saints, and ornamented on occasions with branches of trees; incense, lamps, and candles; votive offerings on recovery from illness; holy water; asylums; holydays and seasons, use of calendars, processions, blessings on fields, sacerdotal vestments, the tonsure, the ring in marriage, turning to the East, images at a later date, perhaps the ecclesiastical chant, and the Kyrie Eleison, are all of pagan origin, and sanctified by their adoption into the Church.&quot; An Essay On The Development Of Christian Doctrine, pp. 359, 360.

Protestantism is defined partially by its support of the Bible as the sole and final authority on the faith. All focus, then, is on the texts. On the opposite end, Catholics uphold authority in apostolic succession. They believe that the teaching authority Christ gave the apostles was passed down and begat things such as the Bible and oral teaching as well and such and still exists with their church now. Further, they uphold that prime apostle&#039;s office - Peter - and call the one in that seat the pope.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Justification: They disagree on what makes one justified in preparation for salvation. Protestants believe that belief of God and trust in His teaching is what makes one just. It manifesting in your life is just a reaction to that. Catholics believe that belief of God and it manifesting in your life is what makes one just.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Understanding what God is: Protestantism largely (but not exclusively) holds God to be anthropomorphic in nature. Akin to a man with powers. They hold a view of God called Theistic Personalism. Catholicism allows such a view for laypeople because it is easy to understand but upholds a position called Classical Theism: where God is a willful ground of reality that is non-composite and non-competitive to creation. How miracles and the very attributes of God are understood differ wildly because of this distinction. Parts of Protestantism support Classical Theism but they are very vaguely applied.<\/span><br><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The Soul: Protestantism is largely understanding the soul as substance dualism. This is understanding the soul as a kind of immaterial substance interacting akin to matter. Catholicism understands the soul as hylomorphic dualism. This is understanding things in nature as a compound of matter and form (substantial form), with form being synonymous with soul in this manner of thought.

All focus, then, is on the texts. On the opposite end, Catholics uphold authority in apostolic succession. They believe that the teaching authority Christ gave the apostles was passed down and begat things such as the Bible and oral teaching as well and such and still exists with their church now. Further, they uphold that prime apostle&#039;s office - Peter - and call the one in that seat the pope.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Justification: They disagree on what makes one justified in preparation for salvation. Protestants believe that belief of God and trust in His teaching is what makes one just. It manifesting in your life is just a reaction to that. Catholics believe that belief of God and it manifesting in your life is what makes one just.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Understanding what God is: Protestantism largely (but not exclusively) holds God to be anthropomorphic in nature. Akin to a man with powers. They hold a view of God called Theistic Personalism. Catholicism allows such a view for laypeople because it is easy to understand but upholds a position called Classical Theism: where God is a willful ground of reality that is non-composite and non-competitive to creation. How miracles and the very attributes of God are understood differ wildly because of this distinction. Parts of Protestantism support Classical Theism but they are very vaguely applied.<\/span><br><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The Soul: Protestantism is largely understanding the soul as substance dualism.

After that case, the state enacted a far narrower provision: It is illegal to wear a mask in the act of committing a crime. The University of California, Berkeley, also has its own regulation for masks: People who are not affiliated with the university cannot wear masks on campus for the purpose of intimidation.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;A New York State law prohibiting \u201cbeing masked or in any manner disguised\u201d in public has withstood legal challenges since 1845 and has been used recently.

Like the laws in other states, the New York statute includes exceptions for masquerade parties and other entertainment events. But unlike other states, New York did not pursue the legislation in response to the Ku Klux Klan.

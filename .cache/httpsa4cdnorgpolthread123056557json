Trump obviously wouldn&#039;t leave existing deductions in place and, even if he did, you can&#039;t pay less than 0% unless you&#039;re poor and claiming tax credits, things which don&#039;t apply to businesses.<br><br>Let&#039;s say two businesses exist today of equal net profit. Company A pays 28% after a few deductions. Company B has really good lawyers and intentionally went into a favored industry of government, let&#039;s say making solar panels, and pays 0%. Combined, they pay 14%.<br><br>Let&#039;s say we have tax reform which reduces the top rate and gets rid of all of those deductions. Company A pays 15%. Company B pays 15%. Combined, they pay 15%.<br><br>Let&#039;s say tax reform doesn&#039;t even touch those deductions. Deductions only deduct from what you owe and cannot put government money into your pocket like a tax credit. Now company A pays 13% and company B pays 0%. Combined, they pay 6.5%.<br><br>Note that &quot;loophole&quot; is just another word for &quot;deduction&quot;. When a politician wants to pretend to oppose a company paying 0% in taxes, they call them &quot;loopholes&quot;. When they vote for the very laws which make is possible, they call them &quot;deductions&quot;.","time":1493313226,"resto":123056557,"id":"YOmb6fwU","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123059175,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)13:17:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123058722\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123058722<\/a><br>larger companies can afford jew lawyers that will reduce their taxes.

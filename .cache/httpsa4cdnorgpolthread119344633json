And that got me thinking about my fellow Bangladeshi Scrapbooking Enthusiast message board users, and what their relationship histories might reveal.<br><br>So let&#039;s rap, my dudes: <br><br>How many serious romantic relationships have you been in(virgins need not apply), what ethnicity were each of your significant others, what brand of politics did they endorse, and where in that chronology does your redpilling occur? Throw in your age and ethnicity too if you feel like it. As is the norm in these types of threads, I&#039;ll start:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;33, Norse-German ancestry, total 6<\/span><br>-German, far left progressive<br>-Lithuanian, far left progressive<br>-German, radical leftist<br>-German, left-leaning normie<br>-German Jew, libertarianish<br>-First German again, far less left than before but still progressive <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;*takes redpill*<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;currently single and perfectly content with that while I sort myself out<\/span><br><br>So white German women are my type apparently. Plus, in a magnificent display of irony, my Jewish ex-gf totally played a not so insignificant role in preparing me for my eventual redpilling. She kept a gun in her nightstand and sleeping with a firearm so close was a new experience for me, and one that&#039;s utter harmlessness clued me into the fact that maybe guns aren&#039;t actually so bad after all.","filename":"schneidergrownups_r900x493","ext":".jpg","w":417,"h":314,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":188,"tim":1491235988091,"time":1491235988,"md5":"qmJQ6hogzaOxk\/IHLzKJOg==","fsize":37306,"resto":0,"id":"XnD0pCzF","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"pols-relationship-history","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

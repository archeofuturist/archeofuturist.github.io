I mean I loved the production values and everything, and it was really cool that they did so much in Latin, Koine, and Aramaic. But it was just so much longer than it needed to be. Jesus&#039; entire life story doesn&#039;t even need to take 2 hours in a feature length film, but the Passion focuses solely on his death and the events leading up to it. Which is like enough to maybe squeeze out a 1hr 20min movie or something. Not like two and a half hours or however long it was. So the result is that an incredibly huge portion of it is just them beating the shit out of Christ<br><br>It&#039;s kind of insulting, to be honest, and it&#039;s just another example of how psychotic Catholics are. I&#039;m pretty sure Christ wants you to focus on his life and the messages he gave during it, not his brutal torture and execution.","time":1493083167,"resto":122668117,"id":"e24vtOfk","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122670368,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)21:20:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122669400\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122669400<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Most audiences I heard sobbed and shed tears and sparred the applause due to this fact.<\/span><br>I distinctly remember my mother giving me a handful of tissues as we sat down to see it in the cinema.

The way I interpret this is Sessions is saying they are focusing on the LEAKERS, i.e. the malicious deep state actors trying to undermine the Trump administration. I don&#039;t get the impression that they are going to go after the publishers of the leaked info or even specifically Assange. Now you may be thinking, clearly it is a fact that the question included &quot;Is it a priority to arrest Assange&quot; and his answer included &quot;yes it is a priority&quot;. HOWEVER, from the context, it is not clear that specifically arresting Assange is a priority. Sessions broadens the reporter&#039;s question and says they are concerned about ALL leaks, not just Assange\/Manning. It appears to me that Sessions is concerned about our enemies, rather than concerned about the man that Donald Trump repeatedly praised throughout the whole presidential campaign.","time":1493677724,"resto":123680633,"id":"XFziTgc1","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123684470,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)18:37:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123683339\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123683339<\/a><br>Its because America has more muh freedom and less totalitarianism. Also, its part of American culture to question the government (see: 1776), so people aren&#039;t as afraid as they are in China or Russia. So actually, its more patriotism. You should be grateful for our patriot leakers who helped expose Hillary et al. Of course there are slippery little sleazy fuckers among the enemy who would leak illegally as well, I&#039;m not defending people who break the law. I&#039;m just saying, it&#039;s one thing to break a law to expose a giga-ultra-lawbreaker. It is a whole &#039;nother can of worms to break the leaking law to get information that you can spin, and decieve the people into taking down Trump and the liberty movement, while also having a mountain of unspeakable acts of law breaking under your belt.

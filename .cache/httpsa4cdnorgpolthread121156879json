I Grew up with king james and the reason im asking this is sorta a i guess a spiritual awaking in a sense. When coming Across the story Jesus and the woman taken in adultery in Gospel of John 7:53-8:1. This is a good story but im gona focus on one part in particular When the Pharisee come to jesus and request that jesus bring judgement jesus instead. Gets down in sand in starts drawing but the bible doesn&#039;t tell us what he&#039;s drawing and this leads me to my point.<br><br>People have tried to make sense of what jesus was drawing in the sand that day. Some say it was the tend commandments, others say that jesus was writing out the sins of the Pharisee in the sands. But desu im kinda of the belief that if the bible didn&#039;t tell us we shouldn&#039;t speculate. Can anyone else relate? The idea that the more men temper with things it becomes more corrupted? That&#039;s why i only read the king james version and my being 20 i&#039;ll be honest. It&#039;s hard at time to read the bible especially with it being in paraphrases. But their is a reason jesus says more or less he does this to attract true believers. Can anyone else relate to this in their life someone possibly older with life experience ?","filename":"king james bible","ext":".jpg","w":1240,"h":1595,"tn_w":194,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492224219241,"time":1492224219,"md5":"A2umDADUMmMOS\/bFL+Ev7A==","fsize":202289,"resto":0,"id":"sr8Fs2hn","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"what-version-do-you-read-pol","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":121157036,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)22:44:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121156879\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121156879<\/a><br>Sorry, not into ancient Jew books.","time":1492224288,"resto":121156879,"id":"CawLmX3a","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

All &quot;explicit&quot; terrorist organizations are offshoots of the MB. The only difference between them and the MB is in the methodology not the ideology. They are all totalitarians, and they will ditch democracy and human rights once it does its job of handing them the reins of power. We experienced that firsthand in Egypt, and the Turks are currently experiencing it as well. Erdogan is not authoritarian, the MB is and he&#039;s just its member.<br><br>I assert that most &quot;Islamic&quot; political and social organizations in the west, or worldwide, are MB entities, the same organizations that Erdogan is probably addressing here, and that most &quot;Islamic&quot; activists are MBians. My assertion is based on the experience we had with them since 2011,same attitude, tactics and discourse, and on the fact that they are the only Islamic organization worldwide that has such capabilities and resources.<br><br>The MB is not comprised of a hawkish wing and a dovish one. Rather it&#039;s a bad cop\/good cop thing. Once good cop\/Now bad cop Erdogan in this threat is simply sending veiled orders to the bad cop wing, just like Morsi did in his 2\/7\/2013 speech.<br><br>Sooner or later, Europe and the world will have to answer the MB question, what to do about a clique that has infiltrated 70 societies worldwide, the same dilemma that we&#039;re currently facing here in Egypt.<br><br>We can debate whether it is to be treated as a terrorist organization or not.","filename":"MB","ext":".jpg","w":300,"h":310,"tn_w":241,"tn_h":249,"tim":1490265992786,"time":1490265992,"md5":"wxdyQqErY4lcp8eKOTmXzA==","fsize":20334,"resto":0,"id":"yBZJBAD2","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"erdogan-threatens-europeans-the-brotherhood","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

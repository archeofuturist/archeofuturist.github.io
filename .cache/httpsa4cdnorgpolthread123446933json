The closest episode might be Bacon&#039;s Rebellion back in 1676. After he died of dysentery the rebellion fell apart.

The emergent free white yeomanry then took to the freedom of the frontier hills. Class conciseness has always existed on the frontier.<br><br>At this point, racial diversity has been pushed to the very limit in order to impose tyranny on the general population. California is the most extreme case of this fact. Racial animosity is a necessary feature of their system. Animosity is a convenient cover for the outsourcing of manufacturing. As the inner cities fell apart, blacks were baited by the media into attacking Korean immigrants. All so that the mayor and governor get to play the roles of peacemaker. Make no mistake, diversity exists by design to enable tyranny.

Under the surface, shit is rotten.<br><br>I won&#039;t profess to have absolute knowledge of the best solutions, but I can see the problems.<br><br>#1) Housing crisis, and related, banking system.<br>The biggest fucking scam of the century is the way debt slavery props up private institutions while the game is rigged to encourage debt slavery through the housing market. After WW2 during a period of national unity and shortage of housing, we built fucking houses and sold them cheap so people could get on with their lives. The baby boomers who got these houses from the greatest generation sell these same houses to our generation with a profit margin of about 800% if they sell at all and simply don&#039;t rent them out.<br><br>Housing prices has increased slowly since post WW2 and more rapidly in the oil-era with assurances from &quot;experts&quot; always that &quot;Seriously guys, we reached the peak now. Seriously.&quot;.But we never reached the peak. Instead it has been normalized that people take out 90% of the cost of the house as loans ($500&#039;000 for a flat) and let bankers get fat while contributing nothing to society. The housing crisis is brought on by extreme demand due lack of new houses built, mass immigration which also brings wages down and centralization because no jobs exist in the countryside. There is no real political will among mainstream parties to solve this as undoubtedly ending this spiral will step on the toes of the biggest benefactors and most powerful in the game.<br><br>The solution is simple. Do what we did post WW2. All housing loans are handled by the STATE. Any interest on loans goes to PUBLIC BENEFIT and not in the pocket of bankers. We build these houses on the public purse and sell them at break-even cost. This creates jobs, creates housing, enriches the people and not the bankers.","filename":"norway","ext":".png","w":804,"h":698,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":217,"tim":1492441027219,"time":1492441027,"md5":"HQT5j4Wk6cQg4i0V0xgOiw==","fsize":99370,"resto":0,"id":"1M5viI0m","country":"NO","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"how-to-fix-the-westfutureeverything","country_name":"Norway","replies":2,"images":1,"unique_ips":2},{"no":121534893,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)10:59:13","name":"Anonymous","filename":"4305333+_6b49d1d6b8d947cf18fbac0c313d11f1","ext":".png","w":200,"h":200,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492441153557,"time":1492441153,"md5":"YRaVgKBMc8jBnm\/D8WOA0Q==","fsize":53653,"resto":121534661,"id":"H8eY84zq","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121536114,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)11:10:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"#2) The frailty of the welfare state<br>There is consensus among norwegians that the welfare state is working and worth keeping. However there seems to be delusion about how we are going to do this. There is a meme in norway that norway is &quot;the richest country in the world&quot;. People will always spout this meme in order to justify spending on almost anything (usually on moral causes such as foreign aid or other virtue-signalling bullshit).<br><br>There is ENORMOUS WASTE in Norway. How in the world can we sustain a welfare state if such waste exists? Examples include:<br>- Generous acceptance of asylum seekers and no will to deport.<br>- Generous acceptance of immigrants &quot;looking for work&quot; (but not really, shittons of beggars in oslo, shittons of NAVers looking for gibsmedats)<br>- Millions given to wasteful foreign aid which pocket the money and barely does shit.<br>- Millions given to useless research like how movies affect gender roles in papa new guinea or some bullshit like that.<br>- Millions given to RELIGIOUS organizations (including muslims, mosques and interest groups) which actively undermine the secular values and cohesion of society.<br><br>Solution, CUT CUT CUT. Foreign aid should be invested in norwegian businesses going to these places to build shit. That gives oversight, creates jobs and competence. And the money stays in the norwegian economy despite going to build a well or a school in some shithole.","time":1492441849,"resto":121534661,"id":"1M5viI0m","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"}]}

A nuclear South Korea is a military threat to Japan and South Korea, and Trump has apparently convinced Xi that it&#039;s a political threat to China. It&#039;s not like these are idle threats either; DPRK regularly fires shit at both countries, and makes credible threats about unleashing total war on either. The USA is their sworn enemy, and as their technology improves they may ultimately be able to hit Hawaii.<br><br>Maybe it&#039;s all a ruse. If it is, there&#039;s nothing to worry about, but it&#039;s better to stop the ruse, and something will be done diplomatically. If not, we need to protect our greatest allies in the Pacific, or we&#039;ll never get our government-mandated Japanese, Korean, or Chinese qt gfs. In all seriousness, we need to protect our allies in the region, and as Kim gets more powerful and starts firing off more and more missiles, he becomes an increasing threat to our allies. This isn&#039;t middle-east &quot;he&#039;s a bad person to his people&quot; interventionism, although that&#039;s also true in this case, this is &quot;he&#039;s literally and probably unironically threatening to nuke 10 million people&quot; interventionism.

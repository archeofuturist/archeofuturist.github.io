There&#039;s lots of girls who are interested in a 1950s style household, and if you&#039;re a high-quality partner, you could snag someone who would be willing to submit to you 24\/7, which seems to be very in line with \/pol\/-tier views.<br><br>However, they also take a radically inclusive view, where you&#039;ll find people unironically referring to each other as xe, xer, etc.<br><a href=\"#p123129572\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123129572<\/a><br>Generally true.

If a girl was a virgin, would you still have sex with her? I personally wouldn&#039;t, just because I know that virginity going into a marriage is more likely to make someone a good partner, and I wouldn&#039;t want to be the one who took the possibility of being an unblemished bride away from someone. OTOH, I figure that if a girl has already had sex outside of marriage, she is used goods, and might as well enjoy. <br><br>Also, how do you find the skinny qts?

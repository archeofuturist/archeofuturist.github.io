Seems really inefficient to me. <br><br>Arguably they already lost 2 major votes (Trump and Brexit) and Lepen has made it to the second round. Wouldn&#039;t they go easy on the happenings instead of continuing to ramp up the terrorist attacks at this point?<br><br>Seems to me Globalism and the happenings were never really their end goal but just something for the world to get riled up, argue and fight about while their true intentions remain hidden from the general public (pic)<br><br>Do you really think they would give a fuck about white genocide or controlling a population through multiculturalism when they already own the central banks and can decide to bankrupt a country whenever they want? They already have all the money and all the power, the only thing they can&#039;t possibly get for now is ensuring their safety against an overwhelmingly large world population going against the handful of them. So why make us hate them?<br><br>Once they&#039;ve removed all the guns and replaced military\/police with a robot army unable to rebel they will be able to impose their will without fear or retribution, but they don&#039;t need globalism for that, it would be a lot easier for them to implement those changes without making waves. Every single time they create waves and controversy more people get redpilled. Wtf are their true intentions? I just don&#039;t get it.<br><br>If we could all live comfortably with high technology and safety in a globalized world most people wouldn&#039;t give a fuck if the ones at the top making the decision were Jews. Why make it so hard on themselves and create friction?","filename":"1482611685749","ext":".jpg","w":960,"h":960,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493140228145,"time":1493140228,"md5":"PDKI7xkOnNsE8r4mge2uJA==","fsize":119216,"resto":0,"id":"sMY6TEtI","country":"AU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"globalist-agenda-and-why-it-doesnt-add-up","country_name":"Australia","replies":1,"images":1,"unique_ips":2},{"no":122756981,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)13:11:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122756898\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122756898<\/a><br>pic related. any questions?","filename":"GLOBALISM EXPLAINED","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":837,"tn_w":89,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493140269783,"time":1493140269,"md5":"nPG37EmDi9iMcRwkBavv+Q==","fsize":122708,"resto":122756898,"id":"SrsDoHUm","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

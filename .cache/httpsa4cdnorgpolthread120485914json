Corruption, while certainly not as ubiquitous as it used to be, is still rife in Russia. A man I met in Vladivostok last year, while we were walking through the city, pointed at a half-built church and jokingly told me the reason they had chosen this particular location to construct it was so that city and regional officials could look out their windows and \u201cask God\u2019s forgiveness for their corruption.\u201d<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The fact that Navalny is a vocal Kremlin critic and ardent opponent of Vladimir Putin has ensured that he has become somewhat of a media darling in the West. He is sometimes hailed as a hero in Western coverage. Time magazine once called him \u201cRussia\u2019s Erin Brockovich.\u201d<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What is reported less often about Navalny are his nationalist leanings, ties to neo-Nazi groups, xenophobic comments and extreme anti-immigrant views. References to Navalny\u2019s nationalism in the West are usually buried or brushed off, while the headlines sing his praises. While we seem somewhat better able to appreciate the complexities of politics and political figures in our own nation, we tend to regard Russia in very simplified terms; there\u2019s a \u201cbad guy\u201d in power and we must therefore support the valiant and oppressed \u201cgood guy.\u201d Many people hear \u201cRussian opposition leader\u201d and immediately assume this is the person with whom their sympathies should lie.<\/span>","filename":"IMG_5831","ext":".jpg","w":1200,"h":800,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1491856146902,"time":1491856146,"md5":"OmqWmaJOYbqVWFcO1dya0Q==","fsize":169895,"resto":120485914,"id":"qZGavEo0","country":"RU","m_img":1,"country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":120486106,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)16:30:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;I\u2019ll spare you Winston Churchill\u2019s \u201cRussia is a riddle\u2026\u201d quote and just say that it\u2019s never that simple. Russian politics is not a clear-cut case of dictator vs. democrat \u2014 and Navalny provides a good example of just why we should be careful to avoid oversimplifying events we don\u2019t fully understand.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Many Navalny supporters are extremely anti-immigrant, particularly when it comes to newcomers from the Caucasus and Central Asia. Many see Putin as playing a part in the destruction of the traditional fabric of Russia. Navalny himself has played a role in skinhead marches in Moscow and earned the sympathies of extremists. In other words, if he were an American, liberals would hate Navalny far more than they hate Trump or Steve Bannon \u2014 and yet he is glorified and exalted as Russia\u2019s last, best hope.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Navalny has been a co-organizer of the \u201cRussian March\u201d \u2014 an annual parade that uses slogans like \u201cRussia for the Russians\u201d and \u201cStop feeding the Caucasus\u201d. He was expelled from one of the country\u2019s liberal parties (Yabloko) for essentially damaging their brand. One of his former colleagues in that party has claimed that Navalny repeatedly used racial slurs.<\/span>","filename":"IMG_5811","ext":".jpg","w":1750,"h":1165,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1491856207362,"time":1491856207,"md5":"E1gb4M0HjDef+Rx07ih0EA==","fsize":867135,"resto":120485914,"id":"qZGavEo0","country":"RU","m_img":1,"country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":120486349,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)16:32:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120485914\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120485914<\/a><br>Salon is trash but it&#039;s reasonable to say that both Putin and Navalny are clowns","time":1491856320,"resto":120485914,"id":"\/\/cMkj5a","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120486370,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)16:32:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"In a bizarre video, Navalny appeared to compare people from the Caucasus(pic related) to \u201ccockroaches\u201d that need to be exterminated.

Many of his supporters in Russia and the West believe the Kremlin has tried to smear him as a dangerous nationalist and to lock him up on trumped-up charges (he has been convicted of fraud and embezzlement). Others believe Navalny himself is a Kremlin plant, working for Putin as controlled opposition.

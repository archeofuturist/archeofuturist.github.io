The Shafi&#039;i school of jurisprudence has a long tradition among the Chechens,[86] and thus it remains the most practiced.[87]<\/span>","time":1491934970,"resto":120632132,"id":"NIm4MGIU","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120632435,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)14:23:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120632132\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120632132<\/a><br>Is that his conversion school that saved his marriage?

Carbon Tax Market was just another scam to make himself more money at other people&#039;s expense.","filename":"Mr_Bones-2","ext":".jpg","w":409,"h":327,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":99,"tim":1493905830194,"time":1493905830,"md5":"fxPcFSLlUokKFhubhRN4GA==","fsize":110695,"resto":124056474,"id":"Zr39GbJ2","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124061544,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)09:50:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124060954\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124060954<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;bill bye is qualified to talk about shit<\/span><br>Damn I guess the only way to have an opinion is to pay 100k to a government funded institution that will give you a piece of paper that now says ur qualified to speak on subjects that you didn&#039;t even study when paying said 100K.","time":1493905853,"resto":124056474,"id":"8kyqwd8X","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124061586,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)09:51:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124061453\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124061453<\/a><br>not land to develop, personal houses.

The point is more subtle than that though. By everything you read in pro-AGW outlets we&#039;re not doing enough and not in time. There&#039;s zero signs of this changing either.<br><br>Already the worst projections are unstoppable and really bad - assuming we cut every GHG to zero next year we&#039;ll still be in deep shit because the effects take time to scale.<br><br>But what I actually said wasn&#039;t &quot;do nothing&quot;. It was focus on mitigation an climate reversal, two areas that are starved from funding because all the pro-AGW sides still want to stop GHG. <br><br>Nobody has the balls to admit it won&#039;t be done in time and it&#039;s already time to switch focus from stopping it into mitigating the consequences.<br><br>Hell, you could even argue that dumping all the money from awareness and lobbying campaigns straight into solar and fusion R&amp;D has a better shot at being meaningful than what we&#039;re doing with it now, if you&#039;re not ready for the &quot;lost cause&quot; pill.","filename":"1410387825478","ext":".jpg","w":498,"h":668,"tn_w":93,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493908668847,"time":1493908668,"md5":"Mf4n2h40ZMiDkl80QD1aVQ==","fsize":29780,"resto":124056474,"id":"0Jzj4BaT","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":124065709,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)10:38:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;yet another thread turned into shitposting by insecure &quot;internet tough guys&quot; faggots<\/span>","filename":"kMy4TMI","ext":".jpg","w":251,"h":242,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":120,"tim":1493908692438,"time":1493908692,"md5":"V6N1vRDMow\/ZcDLYPsmjJw==","fsize":11184,"resto":124056474,"id":"POcPvdwk","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":124065792,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)10:38:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;people questioning the value of comparing numbers to other numbers relative to another number<\/span><br><br>wew","time":1493908734,"resto":124056474,"id":"3oqw68tb","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":124065795,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)10:38:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124065181\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124065181<\/a><br><a href=\"#p124065047\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124065047<\/a><br>It&#039;s called drawing a hard line.<br>We know where they are going with this global warming scam and the best way to prevent them from jewing us is by refusing to acknowledge the problem that they&#039;re using as an opportunity to scam us exists.<br><br>It&#039;s like when you get that call from Indian scammers saying there&#039;s a problem with your computer.

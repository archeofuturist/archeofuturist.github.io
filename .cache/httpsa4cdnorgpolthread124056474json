Carbon Tax Market was just another scam to make himself more money at other people&#039;s expense.","filename":"Mr_Bones-2","ext":".jpg","w":409,"h":327,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":99,"tim":1493905830194,"time":1493905830,"md5":"fxPcFSLlUokKFhubhRN4GA==","fsize":110695,"resto":124056474,"id":"Zr39GbJ2","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124061544,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)09:50:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124060954\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124060954<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;bill bye is qualified to talk about shit<\/span><br>Damn I guess the only way to have an opinion is to pay 100k to a government funded institution that will give you a piece of paper that now says ur qualified to speak on subjects that you didn&#039;t even study when paying said 100K.","time":1493905853,"resto":124056474,"id":"8kyqwd8X","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124061586,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)09:51:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124061453\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124061453<\/a><br>not land to develop, personal houses.

In the end, what killed Him was His raptured heart.<br><br>Crucifixion is an insidious torture, because what is supposed to kill you? Thirst? Exertion? In fact, you die of suffocation or of heart failure. <br><br>As you&#039;re spread in an uncomfortable position, first your legs, trying to hold your weight, give up and get torn out of their sockets, then arms do. Then, as your body hangs awkwardly on your pectorals, you struggle to breathe. Everytime you try to breathe you must force yourself to raise your body a little, relying on your mangles legs and arms. This effort steadily weakens your heart, exhausted and thirsty for oxygen. Jesus said &quot;I thirst&quot; because he sweated out all nutrients from His organism.<br><br>In the end, your heart simply gives up. It&#039;s easier to stop struggling and just suffocate, in fact Roman soldiers often broke your legs and arms so you couldn&#039;t struggle and just died swiftly, but Jesus was refused that. When Longinus and the others went to check up on Jesus, He was already dead - there was no need to break Him.","filename":"Cross-FS","ext":".jpg","w":700,"h":525,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1492160296095,"time":1492160296,"md5":"B6OTaA9ync9bXc2GIKXrsA==","fsize":61954,"resto":0,"id":"ZUhmOc8a","country":"PL","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"our-lord-has-suffered-agony-for-several-hours-in","country_name":"Poland","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

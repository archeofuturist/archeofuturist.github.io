That small, far-right movement that seeks a whites-only state is developing new coded language, much as the Nazis once did, says linguist George Lakoff, a professor emeritus at the University of California at Berkeley.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;SJW? I had no clue. In a personal ad it might mean \u201cstraight Jewish woman,\u201d but two of those don\u2019t apply to me. So what was this snarky new gem of an insult?<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I emailed back, \u201cWhat is an SJW?\u201d The reply: \u201cAn SJW is a social justice warrior. In the press, this particular public predator tends to be big on PC [political correctness] virtue signaling but happy to smear others viciously with false accusations of sexism, racism, white nationalism, hate speech, etc.\u201d<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Snowflake.This is no compliment, even if you like to think that you\u2019re one of a kind. At best, it\u2019s a derisive term for someone considered entitled,<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Libtard.\u201cLib\u201d is for \u201cliberal,\u201d while \u201ctard\u201d is shorthand for \u201cretard.\u201d<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Cuck.I heard this one while watching Bill Maher\u2019s HBO show several weeks ago. One of his guests kept using it. It\u2019s short for \u201ccuckservative,\u201d which is a word cocktail made up of equal parts \u201cconservative\u201d and \u201ccuckold.\u201d Urban Dictionary defines it as \u201ca racial slur for a White person that is not loyal to White Supremacy\u201d<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Masculinist.I\u2019m an out and proud feminist, but I\u2019d never heard of \u201cmasculinist.\u201d According to Merriam-Webster, it\u2019s \u201can advocate of male superiority or dominance\u201d and is often used to promote traditional gender roles.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Bottom line: It pays to increase your word power these days. There\u2019s much more to alt-right coded language than meets the eye \u2013 or the ear.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;The strategy is to control discourse,\u201d Lakoff points out. \u201cOne way you do that is preemptive name calling . . . based on a moral hierarchy. &quot;<\/span><br><br>http:\/\/archive.is\/fijl6","filename":"Screenshot_20170411180244_1_0","ext":".jpg","w":1076,"h":1479,"tn_w":181,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492102314967,"time":1492102314,"md5":"W0X4\/odkcYzEDD+tRmrdKQ==","fsize":166882,"resto":0,"id":"NAS9\/mS0","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"wapo-learning-about-pols-secret-language","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":120930952,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)12:54:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120930675\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120930675<\/a><br>How can I learn all of our secret code language?","time":1492102470,"resto":120930675,"id":"c3C3GSk6","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120931273,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)12:57:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120930675\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120930675<\/a><br>Liberals can&#039;t be this retarded and out of touch.

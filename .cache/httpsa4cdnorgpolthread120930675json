That small, far-right movement that seeks a whites-only state is developing new coded language, much as the Nazis once did, says linguist George Lakoff, a professor emeritus at the University of California at Berkeley.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;SJW? I had no clue. In a personal ad it might mean \u201cstraight Jewish woman,\u201d but two of those don\u2019t apply to me. So what was this snarky new gem of an insult?<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I emailed back, \u201cWhat is an SJW?\u201d The reply: \u201cAn SJW is a social justice warrior. In the press, this particular public predator tends to be big on PC [political correctness] virtue signaling but happy to smear others viciously with false accusations of sexism, racism, white nationalism, hate speech, etc.\u201d<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Snowflake.This is no compliment, even if you like to think that you\u2019re one of a kind.

One of his guests kept using it. It\u2019s short for \u201ccuckservative,\u201d which is a word cocktail made up of equal parts \u201cconservative\u201d and \u201ccuckold.\u201d Urban Dictionary defines it as \u201ca racial slur for a White person that is not loyal to White Supremacy\u201d<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Masculinist.I\u2019m an out and proud feminist, but I\u2019d never heard of \u201cmasculinist.\u201d According to Merriam-Webster, it\u2019s \u201can advocate of male superiority or dominance\u201d and is often used to promote traditional gender roles.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Bottom line: It pays to increase your word power these days.

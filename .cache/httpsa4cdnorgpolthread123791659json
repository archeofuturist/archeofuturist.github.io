This is often an expected outcome upon vaccination and is usually controlled in infants by over-the-counter medication if necessary.<br><br>In addition, concerns have been raised regarding whether adjuvants may be able to trigger responses to self-proteins causing autoimmunity. An increased number of narcolepsy (a chronic sleep disorder) cases in children and adolescents was observed in Scandinavian and other European countries after vaccinations, in 2009, to address the H1N1 \u201cswine flu\u201d pandemic.[10]<br><br>Narcolepsy has previously been associated with HLA-subtype DQB1*602, which has led to the prediction that it is an autoimmune process. After a series of epidemiological investigations, researchers found that the higher incidence correlated with the use of AS03-adjuvanted influenza vaccine (Pandemrix). Those vaccinated with Pandemrix have almost a 12 times higher risk of developing the disease. The adjuvant of the vaccine contained vitamin E that was no more than a day\u2019s normal dietary intake. Vitamin E increases hypoceratin-specific fragments that bind to DQB1*602, leading to the hypothesis that autoimmunity may arise in genetically susceptible individuals,[10] however, no clinical data is available to support this hypothesis yet.<br><br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Adjuv<wbr>ant","filename":"761fb91ce5dff5a2936be8a579287964d2a9f5a2855ba7ab8e839c425c6e90af","ext":".jpg","w":625,"h":390,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":78,"tim":1493748955766,"time":1493748955,"md5":"7yciCqHMZf1ufDxkEj+4EA==","fsize":43951,"resto":123791659,"id":"3CiH2lhS","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123797810,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)14:17:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123797301\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123797301<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;How does barium and mercury help my body?<\/span><br><br>They&#039;re perservatives.

Other problems with the development of adjuvants include restricted adjuvanticity of certain formulations to a few antigens, use of aluminum adjuvants as reference adjuvant preparations under suboptimal conditions, non-availability of reliable animal models, use of non-standard assays and biological differences between animal models and humans leading to the failure of promising formulations to show adjuvanticity in clinical trials. The most common adjuvants for human use today are still aluminum hydroxide and aluminum phosphate, although calcium phosphate and oil emulsions also have some use in human vaccinations. During the last 15 years much progress has been made on development, isolation and chemical synthesis of alternative adjuvants such as derivatives of muramyl dipeptide, monophosphoryl lipid A, liposomes, QS21, MF-59 and immunostimulating complexes (ISCOMS).<br><br>so we switch from aluminum to heavy metals as adjuvants and wonder why numerous mental issues take a spike<br><br>shit its like talking to someone that doesnt know about the issue of using lead in all of our products","time":1493749163,"resto":123791659,"id":"3CiH2lhS","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123798372,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)14:21:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123798126\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123798126<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The most common adjuvants for human use today are still aluminum hydroxide and aluminum phosphate<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;we switch from aluminum to heavy metals<\/span><br> calculus was just not your thing in high school, huh","time":1493749282,"resto":123791659,"id":"JokCO90C","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123798520,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)14:22:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123791659\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123791659<\/a><br>You want a retarded kid or a dead kid?

When a pregnant woman is exposed to methylmercury, it may increase the risk of silent birth and the birth of babies with deformities or severe nervous system diseases, even when the mother does not show any symptoms of poisoning [3,4]. Accordingly, most developed countries including the US, Canada, and Japan, set and manage recommendation standards for fish and shellfish intake as a part of the protection of vulnerable classes such as pregnant women and infants from methylmercury. In Korea, however, special recommendations for fish and shellfish intake do not exist, with the exception of freshwater fish, although there is a standard allowance for the mercury concentration in fish and shellfish. Furthermore, sufficient data on health disorders occurring in the normal population because of chronic exposure to low concentrations of methylmercury and various effects of poisoning on susceptible classes such as pregnant women and fetuses have not been gathered.<br><br>https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/ar<wbr>ticles\/PMC3514465\/<br><br>glad we switched from aluminum to FUCKING MERCURY<br><br>that couldnt be because of the ease of manufacturing with mercury in contrast to the difficulties found with aluminum<br><br>no one would expose a populace to a heavy metal just to save a few bucks<br><br>oh wait, there is endless precedence of this","time":1493749818,"resto":123791659,"id":"3CiH2lhS","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123799823,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)14:30:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123799644\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123799644<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;useless degree<\/span><br>kekekekekek<br>jealous, cletus?","time":1493749829,"resto":123791659,"id":"JokCO90C","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123799909,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)14:31:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123799586\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123799586<\/a><br><br>Honestly this though. <br><br>Wish anti-vaxers would just get whooping cough and die already. <br><br>That said I don&#039;t take the flu vaccine any year cause it just gives me the fucking flu.

It is deposited preferentially in the most active areas of bone growth, primarily at the periosteal surfaces. Other factors important in absorption and deposition include age and dietary restrictions. ... Inhaled barium can be absorbed through the lung or directly from the nasal membrane into the bloodstream. ... Insoluble compounds, such as barium sulfate, accumulate in the lungs and are cleared slowly by ciliary action. Barium is eliminated in the urine and in the feces, the rates varying with the route of administration. ... Barium possesses chemical and physiological properties that allow it to compete with and replace calcium in processes mediated normally by calcium, particularly those relating to the release of adrenal catecholamines and neurotransmitters, such as acetylcholine and noradrenaline. ... Barium doses as low as 0.2-0.5 mg\/kg body weight, generally resulting from the ingestion of barium chloride or carbonate, have been found to lead to toxic effects in adult humans. Clinical features of barium poisoning include acute gastroenteritis, loss of deep reflexes with onset of muscular paralysis and progressive muscular paralysis.

Poling was diagnosed months later with encephalopathy (brain disease) caused by a mitochondrial enzyme deficit, a mitochondrial disorder; it is not unusual for children with such deficits to develop neurologic signs between their first and second years.[14] There is little scientific research in the area: no scientific studies show whether childhood vaccines can cause or contribute to mitochondrial disease, and there is no scientific evidence that vaccinations damage the brains of children with mitochondrial disorders.[12][16] Although many parents view this ruling as confirming that vaccines cause regressive autism, most children with autism do not seem to have mitochondrial disorders, and the case was settled without proof of causation.[12][17]<br><br>how many of those other cases lacked proof of causation?

The IOM review did, however, note the possibility of such a relationship and recommended further studies be conducted. A recently published second review (IOM 2004) appears to have abandoned the earlier recommendation as well as backed away from the American Academy of Pediatrics goal.

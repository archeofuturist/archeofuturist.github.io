Around it, the Aztecs created a large artificial island using a system similar to the creation of chinampas. To overcome the problems of drinking water, the Aztecs built a system of dams to separate the salty waters of the lake from the rain water of the effluents. It also permitted them to control the level of the lake. The city also had an inner system of channels that helped to control the water.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;During Cort\u00e9s&#039; siege of Tenochtitlan in 1521, the dams were destroyed, and never rebuilt, so flooding became a big problem for the new Mexico City built over Tenochtitlan.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mexico City suffered from periodic floods; in 1604 the lake flooded the city, with an even more severe flood following in 1607. Under the direction of Enrico Mart\u00ednez, a drain was built to control the level of the lake, but in 1629 another flood kept most of the city covered for five years. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Eventually the lake was drained by the channels and a tunnel to the P\u00e1nuco River, but even that could not stop floods, since by then most of the city was under the water table. The flooding could not be completely controlled until 1967, with the construction of a Deep Drainage System.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The ecological consequences of the draining were enormous. Parts of the valleys were turned semi-arid, and even today Mexico City suffers for lack of water. Due to overdrafting that is depleting the aquifer beneath the city, Mexico City is estimated to have dropped 10 meters in the last century. Furthermore, because soft lake sediments underlie most of Mexico City, the city has proven vulnerable to soil liquefaction during earthquakes, most notably in the 1985 earthquake when hundreds of buildings collapsed and thousands of lives were lost.<\/span>","filename":"Tenochtitlan-Mexico City","ext":".jpg","w":687,"h":715,"tn_w":120,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490479160536,"time":1490479160,"md5":"epk3ZaKxt0oYwr0nM\/0dpw==","fsize":247678,"resto":118276891,"id":"8BcU7s+B","country":"MX","country_name":"Mexico"},{"no":118278186,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)17:59:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"Lol @ a Costa Rican saying this. <br><br>You third-world trash chiquita banana spic!","time":1490479191,"resto":118276891,"id":"fvA5dac7","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

Consider how dangerous technologies can be as they get ever more complex. For instance, see biological warfare, if someone wanted to they could create a microbe that has the potential to kill all human life on this planet. However, at the same time people can use the same technology to cure diseases and illnesses. <br><br>A totalitarian system always seeks to preserve it&#039;s own existence by any means. If it is not perfect it will eventually succumb to some sort of threat. This may be an internal problem, or an external physical problem (such as an asteroid).<br><br>This means a perfect totalitarian state must have technological growth so it can prepare for any external threat and survive (intercept an asteroid, stop a superbug, space colonization, et cetera). As I mentioned earlier you need a specific culture to deal with new technologies and some cultures are not as compatible with some technologies as others. For instance, you wouldn&#039;t want Muslims to be driving ships going half the speed of light because they could destroy a planet if they decided to purposely crash.<br><br>So what this state does is create simulations. These simulations provide two benefits: genetic and memetic evolutionary simulations. What I mean by this is through a simulation we can figure out which genes are optimal and which genes are suboptimal for what we want to accomplish. The same goes for memetics. We can figure out which cultural values are superior and which are inferior for accomplishing certain goals.<br><br>The perfect totalitarian state can then take this information and make the optimal decisions necessary for it&#039;s own survival. It can change both the genes and memes of the sentient beings under it&#039;s rule to adapt to any threat.","time":1491997047,"resto":120742747,"id":"qFAVAGSy","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120745553,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)07:37:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120745531\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120745531<\/a><br>The purpose of our existence is to be useful to our creators.

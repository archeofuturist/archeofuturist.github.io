Especially with counter-leftist, counter-SJW, counter-progressive and\/or counter-globalist themes or messages within your stories. Or even just fiction that subscribes to moderate messages. You obviously don&#039;t have to give out titles and full descriptions, since there are ShareBlue shills and the like everywhere on this board.","filename":"books","ext":".jpg","w":1680,"h":1050,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":156,"tim":1492748483279,"time":1492748483,"md5":"26+PlnFKggUA09UsTJzQzg==","fsize":304258,"resto":0,"id":"B8ndgHkO","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"so-im-curious-are-there-any-pol-writefags-out","country_name":"United States","replies":12,"images":2,"unique_ips":9},{"no":122095118,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)00:22:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122095034\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122095034<\/a><br>I do","time":1492748525,"resto":122095034,"id":"OrjfDpSL","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122096765,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)00:39:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"bump<br><br><a href=\"#p122095118\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122095118<\/a><br>You ever publish online or is it just a hobby?","time":1492749547,"resto":122095034,"id":"B8ndgHkO","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122097363,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)00:45:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"In between working 110 hours\/week, yes.","time":1492749936,"resto":122095034,"id":"LTnS61Ar","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122097510,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)00:47:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"I wrote a WWIII novel once<br><br>It was kind of just a Metal Gear rip-off","time":1492750021,"resto":122095034,"id":"e1prWpBP","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":122097663,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)00:48:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122096765\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122096765<\/a><br>I publish online.

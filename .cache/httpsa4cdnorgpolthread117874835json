Time and time again. Every time a culture or a civilisation becomes hegemonic, it&#039;s through force and the destruction of resistance. The period that comes after that is what we call &quot;peace&quot;, and where the people born into this new system develop their ideas about how magnificent and superior it is to other systems. And then this civilisation grows old, becomes undone at the seams, and dissidence emerges as a critique of the hegemony&#039;s barbaric practices that were once considered the beacon of civilisation. I have no difficulty imagining a hypothetical caliphate where (potentially) people who descend from my bloodline will think very different things and see the world in a very different way compared to me.

I have double nationality, so it was easier to see things from two different points of view. From there, it became even easier to reject any sort of patriotism. It mirrors the pathway towards atheism: you don&#039;t believe in a ton of gods and all you have to do is reject that one last god you&#039;re clinging to. In nationalism, you realise it&#039;s connected to the place where you were accidentally born, and once you realise there are hundreds of these places and all of them use the same rhetorical devices, then you&#039;re on your way out of patriotism.","time":1490245048,"resto":117874835,"id":"AsGuSeVn","country":"PT","country_name":"Portugal"},{"no":117890256,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)00:58:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117889396\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117889396<\/a><br>hello there eikaiwa kid","time":1490245127,"resto":117874835,"id":"OGZprjwo","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117890429,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)01:00:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117874835\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117874835<\/a><br><br>What was the Laughing Man doing there?","filename":"Laughing Man IRL","ext":".gif","w":500,"h":262,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":65,"tim":1490245220903,"time":1490245220,"md5":"hw4hJJ+QbOrvJm09KMc0Ng==","fsize":511617,"resto":117874835,"id":"Slyr4yzZ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117890549,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)01:01:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117889825\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117889825<\/a><br>What&#039;s he saying?","time":1490245279,"resto":117874835,"id":"OGZprjwo","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117890557,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)01:01:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Always see white people stopping to see if everyone&#039;s okay, even if it was only something incredibly minor that happened<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;This mud person just strolls by, seemingly disgusted by the fact that she&#039;s been subjected to this sight<\/span>","filename":"1482522724448","ext":".png","w":410,"h":816,"tn_w":62,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490245285733,"time":1490245285,"md5":"geUsI7Quy7RIali+2T+4DQ==","fsize":418606,"resto":117874835,"id":"xLIn9HuY","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117890562,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)01:01:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"WTF is this shit pol!???!<br><br>explain!!! are they trying to push a narrative this attack was actually perpetrated by online-nazi trolls in an attempt to further demonize Muslims in an effort to shift people further right? so they can eventually claim they need to censor this board because its a hide out for nazi terrorists that plan attacks?","filename":"wtfisthisshiet","ext":".png","w":1000,"h":563,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1490245288730,"time":1490245288,"md5":"dAsvWTCp6+wpD20ufOsabw==","fsize":208287,"resto":117874835,"id":"AuGMrflp","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117890618,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)01:02:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117874835\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117874835<\/a><br>The left don&#039;t take issue with the fact that you want to keep this country safe.

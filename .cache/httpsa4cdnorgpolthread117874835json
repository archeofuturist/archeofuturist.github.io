The period that comes after that is what we call &quot;peace&quot;, and where the people born into this new system develop their ideas about how magnificent and superior it is to other systems. And then this civilisation grows old, becomes undone at the seams, and dissidence emerges as a critique of the hegemony&#039;s barbaric practices that were once considered the beacon of civilisation. I have no difficulty imagining a hypothetical caliphate where (potentially) people who descend from my bloodline will think very different things and see the world in a very different way compared to me.

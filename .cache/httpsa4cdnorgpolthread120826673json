It started in 2013 and has received $1.2 billion so far, and is an EU project based out of Geneva. Why isn&#039;t the U.S. investing in something similar? I personally find the project interesting as hell and the potential applications of learning what it could shed light on are absolutely massive, perhaps up there with the Human Genome Project. <br><br>What do you think, is this something cool that should get more funding and recognition, something potentially dangerous we should be cautious about, or is neuroscience in general a meme and is it all a big money sink? What will the biggest and most useful applications of all of the research be in your opinion?","filename":"image","ext":".jpg","w":512,"h":512,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492038404127,"time":1492038404,"md5":"LpKDyw+WDAdG9MrhBvwkeQ==","fsize":55800,"resto":0,"id":"E7b3xdWS","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"have-you-heard-of-the-human-brain-project","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":120827385,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)19:12:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120826673\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120826673<\/a><br>just money laundering by CIA homos.

The numbers:<br><br>Le Pen - 25%<br>Melenchon - 21.7%<br>Macron - 21.0%<br>Fillon - 20.2%<br>Hamon - 5.2%<br><br>Shut up an trust me on that. I will be right. Le Pen historically always overperforms her polls unless there is another credible right wing candidate for her votes to go to. There isn&#039;t. I have used a variety of other methods to calculate the other numbers; to be very brief, always remember that Macron&#039;s base is FRAGILE (1\/3 of voters could change minds) and is attracted to Melenchon&#039;s base, where as Fillon has stalled because of Penelopegate, and there is no reason to vote for Hamon as Melenchon becomes the candidate for the Left. <br><br>2nd Round will be 51.43% for Le Pen and 48.51% for Melenchon. Polls after the first round will show roughly a 54\/46 race, favouring Melenchon. <br><br>The crucial moment will come when Fillon ENDORSES Le Pen (or several prominent members of his party). Why would he\/they do that, you ask? Because they support Le Pen AGAINST the commie Melenchon (he wants 100% tax on rich). ALSO, they will have a parliamentary majority, and want to get shit done. THEY CAN GET SHIT DONE WITH LE PEN, BUT NOT WITH MELENCHON. This is crucial to remember.<br><br>This will be the FINAL BLOW. Currently (((polls))) predict the abstention rates of Fillon supporters in a 2nd round Le Pen\/Melenchon to be approximately 50%. (i.e. 50% do not vote at all). Fillon\/his party&#039;s endorsement of Le Pen will reduce this rate to approximately 30%, which results in the 51.43% victory I described above. So, add all these factors in and Le Pen will Make France Great Again. I&#039;m waiting, \/pol\/. Shortly, you will see that I was right.","time":1492940429,"resto":122403248,"id":"rENelaOd","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":122404753,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)05:40:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122404711\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122404711<\/a><br>Melenchon is a cuck, Macron is more on the right but is a sneaky cuck and also a jew-banker tier","time":1492940446,"resto":122403248,"id":"DhRLW7g\/","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":122404773,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)05:41:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122404637\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122404637<\/a><br>It&#039;s the film (((Defiance))) about the Jewish resistance fighters that lived in a forest.<br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=FVN<wbr>R8PrtnQc","time":1492940466,"resto":122403248,"id":"K1LRTwwf","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122404778,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)05:41:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122404738\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122404738<\/a><br><br>pls stop with this ridiculous copypasta","time":1492940471,"resto":122403248,"id":"yhMsRbOF","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":122404787,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)05:41:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122404426\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122404426<\/a><br>there&#039;s countless reasons for someone to let your citizens keep the citizenship and vote from another country, it&#039;s up to your brain to understand basic democratic rights<br><br>I&#039;m french and I live abroad for several months at time for work, I&#039;ve been in italy since november and will go back to france in june, if it was for retards like you I wouldn&#039;t have been able to vote today","time":1492940475,"resto":122403248,"id":"KAV5PaMO","country":"IT","country_name":"Italy"},{"no":122404792,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)05:41:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122404563\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122404563<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;nobody ever left the European Union, aka you fu-<\/span>","time":1492940482,"resto":122403248,"id":"MmYawE8F","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122404800,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)05:41:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"I spread me ass daddy<br><br>Fill me with your chunky rotten yogurt Kum <br><br>So sour and rancid it tastes of putrified onions <br><br><br>You are all being monitored and your ips have been logged in googles database. <br><br>Keylogger windows 10 passwords bank accounts <br><br>Soybean oil is carcinogenic <br><br>I&#039;ve parted my cheeks and began defecating do you smell the anal release?

Waffen-Grenadier-Division der SS &quot;Charlemagne&quot; (franz\u00f6sische Nr.1). At this time it had a strength of 7,340 men. The Charlemagne Division was sent to fight the Red Army in Poland, but on 25 February it was attacked at Hammerstein (present day Czarne) in Pomerania, by troops of the Soviet 1st Belorussian Front. The Soviet forces split the French force into three pockets. One group commanded by Krukenberg survived. It was evacuated from the coast by the German Navy to Denmark and later sent to Neustrelitz for refitting; the second group with Oberf\u00fchrer Puaud was destroyed by Soviet artillery and the third group tried fighting its way back westward, but by 17 March all had been captured or killed in action.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;evacuated<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;destroyed<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;captured or killed in action<\/span>","filename":"1479848668337","ext":".png","w":500,"h":513,"tn_w":121,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492940645432,"time":1492940645,"md5":"do84Xkj\/ouniFsaIjyAUqg==","fsize":121809,"resto":122403248,"id":"IZuYAINo","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":122404994,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)05:44:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122404813\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122404813<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Macron will win<\/span><br><br>Jamais!","filename":"Jeanne","ext":".jpg","w":980,"h":1482,"tn_w":82,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492940644780,"time":1492940644,"md5":"6ildmhFHD0ad72w\/FcHpbg==","fsize":2026010,"resto":122403248,"id":"YaZDMql9","country":"DE","m_img":1,"country_name":"Germany"},{"no":122405004,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)05:44:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122403355\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122403355<\/a><br>I give my energy to glorious France.

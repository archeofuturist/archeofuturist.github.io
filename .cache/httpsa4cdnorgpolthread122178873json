Ultimately we need to wipe them all out in a nuclear exchange however this is highly unrealistic. <br>It would take a huge shift in global power for this to even be on the table. Likely a WW3 level event. Furthermore in a WW3 level situation there is no guarantee we are in power. <br>I don&#039;t think genocide will work it didn&#039;t work for the jews. Again it would take a huge WW3 level event to even make this remotely possible.<br><br>Unrealistic<br><br>So what do we do??????<br><br>Even if we ban them from our countries how long will that last? If you look at the trajectory of Islam over the last thousand years it is troubling. How long till they control Europe or Asia? How long till they outnumber us?","filename":"113988","ext":".jpg","w":800,"h":600,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1492805607598,"time":1492805607,"md5":"5a1izkuUq4p0DcY8\/oiOVQ==","fsize":193205,"resto":0,"id":"pqIfFA7w","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"what-to-do-about-islam","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

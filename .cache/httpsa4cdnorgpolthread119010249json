Politics (and what comes with it - government, etc.) have an impact on your life. When you discuss left vs right and authoritarian vs libertarian, you&#039;re talking about the use of force. You&#039;re enacting legislation, and laws have to be enforced by people with guns and the threat of violence (physically or civilly), fundamentally.

You&#039;re standing on the efforts of some of those individuals right now.<br><br> Do you ever plan to have kids?

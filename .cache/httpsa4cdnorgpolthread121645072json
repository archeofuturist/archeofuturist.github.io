If the cops have made airguns illegal, and that includes paintball markers, than case closed. Paintball guns are off limits. It&#039;s a shame, because I know that paintball guns are frequently employed by farmers and private security forces as a less-than-lethal means of moving people off of restricted property. As long as the paintballs aren&#039;t frozen, they basically just leave small welts\/bruises.","time":1492509322,"resto":121645072,"id":"r+TH06TE","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121664930,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)06:02:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121653007\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121653007<\/a><br>Going in WH40K Space Marine armor or dressing up like Solid Snake from MGS.","time":1492509754,"resto":121645072,"id":"DnwK5RhI","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121665717,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)06:10:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"How do you breathe in it?","filename":"Screen Shot 2017-04-18 at 3.09.15 AM","ext":".png","w":284,"h":692,"tn_w":51,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492510231954,"time":1492510231,"md5":"YmLP5rAmm1FjG9kWDdzOpg==","fsize":352631,"resto":121645072,"id":"0BDMfwsR","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121666230,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)06:15:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121650877\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121650877<\/a><br>T\u00e4\u00e4, mutta eik\u00f6h\u00e4n se levi\u00e4 t\u00e4nnekkin jossain skaalassa","time":1492510522,"resto":121645072,"id":"G7dPHvaL","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":121666581,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)06:18:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121645072\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121645072<\/a><br><br>You guys are making a classic tactical mistake by choosing gear based on what you see other people wearing.

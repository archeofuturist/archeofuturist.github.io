Apperantly the warehouse I was at was in a &quot;bad part of town&quot; but the nogs were just more lazy than anything else. And shit there were a lot of Asians but they all acted like they were from California and we&#039;re white washed as fuck, the only group that wasn&#039;t white washed were Indians but why the fuck do you get Indians to begin with?<br>For that matter why do you have straight out of Africa niggers too?<br>Back to the original question Is the relatively low level of noggery and chinking only because I hung out with a high class crowd or is this true throughout?<br>How did you accomplish this? <br>t.

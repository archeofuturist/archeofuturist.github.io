That we&#039;re all - not just in the United States, but that every human being on the planet was soon to become an individualist consumer. One little atom in a big global blob of undifferentiated, raceless, genderless mass.. This is what is called the end of history. That is, the notion that there is no more struggle, no more conflict, there is no more identity, there is no more meaning, and there is no more history. It s all been solved (Bill Clinton did it, or something). We&#039;ll all be little citizens of our nation states that are effectively abstract entities that have no connection to history, and we&#039;ll all just buy stuff from the internet.. that is the end of history. That is something that seemed almost plausible at some point in my life. But there comes a time, when upheaval bites back. There comes a time when something - this undifferentiated individualist mass goes so far, goes so far into a nihilism - goes so far into a destruction of meaning, and identity - that we have to pull ourselves out of it by the scruff of our own collar, that we have to demand meaning, that we have to demand identity, that we have to become something that we aren&#039;t, that we have to become something greater than ourselves, that we have to become part of a family, part of a story - and that&#039;s what the alt right is.&quot;<br>-Richard Spencer<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;muh eceleb<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;muh israel<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;muh bad leader<\/span><br>Say what you want about the guy, but I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve ever seen the alt-right so properly defined.<br><br>Jump to 13:30-16:30 for the action<br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=7jg<wbr>yT67fP6k","filename":"DvXsjqbk","ext":".jpg","w":512,"h":512,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492794228303,"time":1492794228,"md5":"LQ6zOLFUkBfi6uWnsCkgdg==","fsize":42497,"resto":0,"id":"HD3SMOdt","country":"ES","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"was-there-ever-a-thread-about-this","country_name":"Spain","replies":10,"images":0,"unique_ips":9},{"no":122157416,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)13:06:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122157179\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122157179<\/a><br><br>Humanity will either initiate the colonization of space within this century or we are going to have war.","time":1492794386,"resto":122157179,"id":"eG6GN7Zx","country":"IN","country_name":"India"},{"no":122157580,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)13:08:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122157416\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122157416<\/a><br>We are going to war no matter what, and perhaps India will be one of the few countries that benefits immensely from it all.","time":1492794486,"resto":122157179,"id":"0GwZVtvn","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122158070,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)13:13:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122157416\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122157416<\/a><br>I&#039;m with the leaf, this shit is not going to end well.<br>Even if we manage to escape the world and low iq minorities they&#039;ll probably just use our technology and go after our space colonies","time":1492794790,"resto":122157179,"id":"HD3SMOdt","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":122158075,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)13:13:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122157179\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122157179<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Richard Spencer<\/span><br>autism incarnate","time":1492794794,"resto":122157179,"id":"v+JrYqm3","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122158144,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)13:13:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"richard is fine as a thinker, and is even apt at answering questions extemporaneously<br><br>however, he is unbelievably poor at making speeches which i think is mostly due to him not even writing them down in the first place<br><br>hitler would spend hundreds of hours practicing gestures, even getting a photographer to take pictures of him so he could critique his own movements. this isn&#039;t even addressing his meticulous monologue writing<br><br>he cannot possibly make a good leader since he lacks the frame of a leader, but he&#039;s the only acceptable thing we have at the moment","time":1492794834,"resto":122157179,"id":"fFMaeUDf","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122158366,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)13:16:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122157179\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122157179<\/a><br>Richard should be sucker punch to death for explaning memes to the normies.","time":1492794965,"resto":122157179,"id":"3x1W94E2","country":"MX","country_name":"Mexico"},{"no":122158546,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)13:17:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122158144\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122158144<\/a><br>One of the best right wing speakers in recent times was Bowden, but he died in 2012","time":1492795070,"resto":122157179,"id":"kLqPjXKE","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122158694,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)13:19:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122158144\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122158144<\/a><br>Gotta say I agree.<br>Even if he is ok as an intellectual, I can&#039;t deny he needs some work on public speaking.

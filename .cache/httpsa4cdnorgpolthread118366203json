Basically, I&#039;m proving anything out of what we understand as traditional marriage is pure degeneracy. The thing I&#039;m focusing on right now is the homosexual &quot;family&quot;. I have collected three studies so far on the instability of such relationship. Do any of you guys have some info to share on this particular subject?","filename":"image","ext":".jpg","w":924,"h":960,"tn_w":240,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490538253297,"time":1490538253,"md5":"D76J1WKNU3lKj5XuxEV0Mw==","fsize":110723,"resto":0,"id":"uuWAq6Gh","country":"BR","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-case-for-the-traditional-family","country_name":"Brazil","replies":9,"images":3,"unique_ips":7},{"no":118366966,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)10:32:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118366203\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118366203<\/a><br>You can talk about AIDS, and how many promiscuous gays have it.","time":1490538760,"resto":118366203,"id":"DQbKWDDC","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":118367474,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)10:38:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"Also talk about how children need to be breastfeed for optimal development.<br><br>There are studies that show that children who only got a substitute have a 6 point lower IQ.","filename":"TwoFathersOneKid","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":400,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1490539094450,"time":1490539094,"md5":"kaEWs\/9HaDGPO1W3BI8qlQ==","fsize":255970,"resto":118366203,"id":"DQbKWDDC","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":118367781,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)10:41:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118366203\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118366203<\/a><br>Well, single parent homes are far more likely to suffer in poverty and produce criminals regardless of socioeconomic standing.<br>There&#039;s a lack of a strong (fe)male role model in same sex families.<br>More specifically, Lesbian couples experience a higher rate of domestic abuse than anyone else.","time":1490539286,"resto":118366203,"id":"Ah2DlMnX","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118367950,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)10:43:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"I find it interesting how many gay couples choose to raise a baby of the opposite sex when they adopt. <br>Pic related was posted by another anon some while ago.","filename":"gay_stats","ext":".png","w":960,"h":905,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":117,"tim":1490539392664,"time":1490539392,"md5":"vMG\/nb8HU2BPuIFETm7MwQ==","fsize":701368,"resto":118366203,"id":"aEuESR+I","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118370433,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)11:07:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"Bumping this ~ Also what are you using for sources anon?<br>https:\/\/www.census.gov\/topics\/famil<wbr>ies.html<br>https:\/\/www.childstats.gov\/","filename":"awkwardfamily","ext":".jpg","w":540,"h":493,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":114,"tim":1490540865744,"time":1490540865,"md5":"27y4S5gMKa1JsaGikUNTWA==","fsize":97293,"resto":118366203,"id":"aEuESR+I","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118371123,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)11:15:08","name":"Anon","com":"Do you mean the sources of the homosexual family instability?

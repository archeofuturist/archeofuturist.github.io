I don&#039;t like making an argument on a topic without having a credible source to back up my claims. <br>I know LGBT as a lifestyle isn&#039;t healthy. I know a preponderance of queers are pedophiles. I try to make arguments against gay couples being able to adopt, but my sources are all so fucking old. <br><br>(((google))) isn&#039;t helping on this issue either. It just keeps leading me to misleading studies that claim there is no significant increase in the incidence of pedophilia with homosexuals. Then in the fine print they&#039;ve redefined pedophilia, and the survey turns out to be 100% based on public opinion (&quot;Only 5% of people polled believed homosexuality and pedophilia are linked. You don&#039;t want to disagree with the majority, do you?&quot;)<br><br>TL;DR I&#039;m looking for credible scholarly sources and studies that I can use when debating the gay rights crowd. And hell, if you&#039;re a shareblue cuck and you think you&#039;ve got a decent source that proves the opposite, throw it at me. The difference between me and you is I expose my views to criticism.","filename":"Disturbing","ext":".png","w":1506,"h":3976,"tn_w":94,"tn_h":249,"tim":1491154472334,"time":1491154472,"md5":"I46\/ufOXlSBZiZ67euwsWg==","fsize":454040,"resto":0,"id":"Q84FXqas","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"lgbt-facts-and-sources","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

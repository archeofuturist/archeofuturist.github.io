I go to a small liberal arts college (mistake I know) and in the past month there have been three &quot;hate crimes&quot;:<br><br>1) Someone wrote &quot;nigger&quot; on a piece of paper and left it in the library. <br>2) Someone wrote it on a whiteboard.<br>3) Someone left a note with it on a black students car. <br><br>In each case the administration sent out a campus email alert about the awfulness of the &quot;crime&quot; and asked us to come forward with information. Most kids have used these three events to point to the systematic racism on campus and how all the white students are supremacists. <br><br>Yesterday there was a sit-in like event where black students yelled with megaphones in our student center and plastered the area with signs like &quot;Welcome to my racist campus,&quot; or &quot;Wake up white people,&quot; apparently pointing to these incidents as the only evidence other than &quot;institutional racism&quot; of which I have never witnessed a credible example. <br><br>I am inclined to believe that it was a false flag. There are tons of cases where minority students have created fake hate crimes on campus to further their agenda. But how the hell can I prove this? In most cases, the police investigated and the students quickly admitted that it was made up. What can I do? <br><br>Ideas?","filename":"1474676398997","ext":".jpg","w":1195,"h":1500,"tn_w":199,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493229496963,"time":1493229496,"md5":"UHAPvrSjcT85CvoFKcWKmQ==","fsize":212098,"resto":0,"id":"X20a+FsT","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"campus-hate-crimes-how-to-prove-false-flag","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

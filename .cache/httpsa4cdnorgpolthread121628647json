Pakistan has little in common with Turkmenistan or Kazakhstan and if any one region came to dominate politics for the whole country it would likely breed a lot of resentment. <br><br>The one unifying factor would be Islam. As soon as they became independent from the Soviets, mosques exploded in number in the Central Asian republics, showing that Islam was very much alive. However, because the new mosques were largely funded by Wahhabi Saudis and Deobandist Pakistanis, a more literal strain of Islam has infiltrated the region. Central Asian dictators largely responded by suppressing Islamic political movements, but the net result has been that the region continues to produce terrorists. I would not be surprised if a united Stanistan became an Islamic theocracy as that might be the solution to domestic stability.<br><br>I don&#039;t think they would be interventionalist in foreign policy because they would still be surrounded by more powerful neighbors. Though Stanistan would be a populous country with nuclear weapons, China, Russia, and India all have greater nuclear capabilities and Iran is no pushover. Access to the ocean would be a huge boon for the landlocked countries, and if they could maintain internal stability, then Stanistan would be able to complete the pipelines necessary to transport Turkmen natural gas to the ocean. <br><br>Kashmir would remain a significant source of tension but it&#039;s not clear if domestic politics would strengthen or dilute Pakistan&#039;s claim. Most of Stanistan probably wouldn&#039;t care and would rather not risk nuclear war with India and the political disunity might weaken Pakistan&#039;s claim, or perhaps they would rally behind Pakistan&#039;s claims.

America certainly has plenty of military bases in the region since the War on Afghanistan. That said, despite America&#039;s attempts to exert influence on the region, they haven&#039;t been particularly successful. Pakistan is more closely aligned with China, Afghanistan is not exactly a fan of America, and the other states have relied more on Russian patronage and joined the CIS, and more recently, the promise of economic growth has had them seeking closer ties with China. Chinese influence was highly visible in the countries I visited, and it seemed that most of the products and vehicles and whatnot came from China. <br><br>As well, I think that because Stanistan would be so concerned with maintaining internal stability, they would likely resort to methods that America finds unsavory and difficult to support.

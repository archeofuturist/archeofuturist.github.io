That&#039;s why they are called illuminati. They brought reason and logic to the forefront. Observation and experimentation is their credo. Because of this, people thought they were trying to persuade people away from the church. To take others spiritual focus and make them focus on the material world. They say the best way to know God is to understand his creation. BUT...... If you look at Genesis. God forbid Adam and Eve to eat from the tree of knowledge. It was satan, the serpent, the morning star, the illuminator, bringer of light, that convinced eve to take a bite. Even going on information from the bible, we can see that God is jealous, envious. He wants his creation to worship him and him only. He forbids eating from the tree of knowledge. (Can you see how this passage is not literal now?) He forbids us to eat from the tree of knowledge! So, the illuminator, bringer of light, the morning star is satan. He always wanted us to gain knowledge. The illuminati also want us to gain knowledge. To focus not on our spiritual existence, but focus on our material existense. So, the illuminati, the light bringers, the enlightened ones, what is their mission? The same it is for satan. To enlighten us with knowledge that will eventually lead us to believe we understand God. The illuminati are satan worshippers. They believe the one and only righteous God is not what he seems and satan is not what he seems. They are trying to fulfill the mission of satan. To turn us from God. To make us believe we are gods. So the final battle can start. Don&#039;t forget, satan was cast out of paradise. He wants to get back. The only way to get back is to challenge and defeat God. Part of this is to convince other &quot;angels&quot; that God is not faultless. That we are not a perfect creation. That we, his favoured creation, turned on him and renounced him, so why shouldn&#039;t they?","time":1491687515,"resto":120162392,"id":"Rpqaulvi","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":120186681,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)17:38:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120162392\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120162392<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;ma&#039;am top left<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;not married<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;no kids<\/span><br>THE FUCKING KID OF HERS IS IN THE PICTURE","time":1491687537,"resto":120162392,"id":"NsIEwDj+","country":"HR","country_name":"Croatia"},{"no":120187044,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)17:41:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120162392\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120162392<\/a><br><br>On the plus side, never seen a Muslim in Star Trek...

Whether Amorc or spock is pro Jew I dont know but the Illuminati are enemies of anyone eho preaches muh end times prophecies, and promotes religious nation states. They do not worship Satan, and there are Satanists who claim Satan promises godhood but this is a trap. The real illuminati has nothing to do with the book of genesis, they think why would God, the most intelligent being, communicate through broken stories? He wouldnt. Only a deceiver would create 3 monotheistic religions based in the same area.<br><br>What they really believe sporitually I do not know outside of that it is a mathematical certainty all souls will become gods and forces are delaying this.<br><br>The real illuminati as far as I know hasnt had any influence since Thomas Jefferson, the only illuminati president. Their symbols were corrupted as Freemasonry went south. The real illuminati shun material wealth and are totlly focused on souls, knowledge, and spirituality. They dont live opulently. Even if you dont buy my take then look at known facts. The historic illuminati leader Weishaupt&#039;s codename was Spartacus, a guy who led a slave revolt. They hate dyanstic wealth, and believe in a 100% inheritance tax. The real illuminati shilled the 1% meme. They dont run the world, they oppose tptb, and a great move of tptb was to infiltrate freemasonry and litter the elite world with illuminati symbolism. <br><br>Outside of the French and American rev the other high point of illluminati power was the Cathars of southern france. Their priests were ascetics, they convinced nobles to divide land amongst all heirs instead of only the eldest to kill dynastic wealth. <br><br>Another point of power and when the word illuminati was coined was when they backed the Gracchi brothers in ancient Rome doing political reform to benefit the masses. Both were brutally murdered and the illuminati took their revenge in the reign of terror.","filename":"1488255503233","ext":".jpg","w":4083,"h":5930,"tn_w":86,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491692826835,"time":1491692826,"md5":"40rYSSedSsY58dZ4P40KRA==","fsize":2547628,"resto":120162392,"id":"bcilJh6A","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":120199061,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)19:15:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120197916\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120197916<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;illuminati and freemasonry are 2 different groups<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;illuminati are the good guys everyone<\/span><br><br>t. corrupted soul that&#039;s already denounced God","time":1491693359,"resto":120162392,"id":"Rpqaulvi","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":120199514,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)19:19:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"As far as I know about Freemasonry its a lot of BS.

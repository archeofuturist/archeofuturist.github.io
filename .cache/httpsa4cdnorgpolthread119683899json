Than one day it hit me - why the fuck would you EVER want to live under communism? It would fucking suck! There is no ambition in communism, no reason to dream, to work harder, to ever seek to do more than just man your fucking spot in the assembly line at the tractor factory. I&#039;d die if I ever had to live like that; Communism crushes the human spirit.","filename":"victoria","ext":".jpg","w":479,"h":640,"tn_w":93,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491446073357,"time":1491446073,"md5":"S\/tGRNfkPw81Q+qCddl\/YA==","fsize":120620,"resto":119683899,"id":"1M38qdxZ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119692835,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)22:36:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119692499\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119692499<\/a><br>Maybe look at ant colonies or bee colonies.

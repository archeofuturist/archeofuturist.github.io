Churchill was controlled by (((them))). Germany was not bombing UK cities but Churchill was fucking annoyed that they weren&#039;t. In the end, he used the excuse of one off-track German bomber to justify bombing cities, which then of course received retaliation from Germany. Dresden didn&#039;t really serve a military purpose as such. Sticking to military targets would have been much more effective. In time, I hope more white Europeans will wake up and realise who has been playing them all along - including the Germans. It&#039;s been divide and conquer all the way.

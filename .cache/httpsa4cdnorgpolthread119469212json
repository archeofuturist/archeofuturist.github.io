The U.S. last week urged Hungary \u201cto avoid taking any legislative action that would compromise CEU\u2019s operations or independence.\u201d<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;An amendment added to the bill on Monday forces foreign universities to close unless there\u2019s a bilateral agreement in place between Hungary and their \u201chome\u201d government and unless they have a campus abroad. CEU currently meets neither new criteria. The law takes effect Wednesday, instead of the originally planned Sept. 1. Universities that fail to meet the rules will be barred from enrolling new students as of Jan. 1, instead of September of next year as foreseen in the bill\u2019s earlier version.<\/span>","filename":"THE ABSOLUTE MADMAN","ext":".jpg","w":535,"h":358,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":167,"tim":1491312778610,"time":1491312778,"md5":"UOPHD19JXIDDLP1uEGvagg==","fsize":136276,"resto":0,"id":"hzJvlOxV","country":"HU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"orban-undaunted-as-hungary-passes-law-targeting","country_name":"Hungary","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

Excelled in school, sports, was popular, etc. Seems like another world now. Then the depression creeped in and they eventually let me go with a general discharge under honorable conditions, and a bunch of shit happened like deaths in the family, personal betrayals, etc. Lost contact with all friends and almost all family over the years.<br><br>Other than that, I&#039;m living the life and have absolutely no plans to improve myself until the money runs out one year and I suck on the muzzle of my shotgun. All of the inspirational calendar bullshit people use to try to convince people not to an hero is totally lost on me, it will happen.","filename":"uploading_death____by_acrylicdreams-d1l3z8t","ext":".jpg","w":970,"h":718,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":92,"tim":1490085963617,"time":1490085963,"md5":"DpKaZAZFSCprOYtDDNU\/SQ==","fsize":111678,"resto":117601797,"id":"wcJ7ZSHv","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117606346,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)04:46:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117601797\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117601797<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;also fixing sleep schedule <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;eating more<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;drinking more water<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;reading and studying more<\/span>","time":1490085984,"resto":117601797,"id":"gCv9Eg9W","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117606667,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)04:51:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117606104\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117606104<\/a><br>Sounds interesting.

Okay, in the mouse utopia experiment scientists studied the effects of rising population in rats. Once the population hit critical mass, multiple things began to happen. One of the many behaviors that scientists observed was self imposed isolation and obsessive grooming, they called these rats &quot;the beautiful ones&quot;<br><br>Your subconscious brain knows through pheromones when you are in a densely populated area. The same behaviors observed in the rats start to manifest the same in you and those around you. This pretty much tells your brain that you don&#039;t need to reproduce, it&#039;s detrimental to you and your species, you should isolate yourself in order to preserve yourself. <br><br>Consider moving to an area low in population.","time":1490086692,"resto":117601797,"id":"\/ZWWbUOR","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

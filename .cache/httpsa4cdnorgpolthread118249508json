Somebody, just a few minutes before you came on the show, you went out and you took the American flag, and you said, &#039;I\u2019m proud of my nation.&#039; You raised it up and God said, &#039;You have been determined through your prayers to influence this nation. You\u2019re watching me; you\u2019re an influential person.&#039; The Spirit of God says, &#039;Hear the word of the prophet to you as a king, I will open that door that you prayed about. And when it comes time for the election, you will be elected.&quot;<br><br>&quot;There will be a praying President, but not a religious one. For I will fool the people, says the Lord. Yes I will. God says the one that is chosen shall go in and the people will say &#039;he has hot blood&#039;. For the Spirit of God says &#039;yes he has hot blood, but he will bring the WALLS OF PROTECTION on this country in a greater way, and the economy of the country shall change rapidly&#039;. Listen to the word of the Lord! God says &#039;I will put at your helm for two terms a President that will pray, but he will not be a praying President at first.

No ideology should be illegal but anti-ideologies should be. Conservatives say some stuff mostly wrong but the alt-right says stuff like &quot;Blacks are subhuman&quot;, &quot;women should be slaves&quot; and &quot;Venezuela is socialism!&quot;. Now of course a lot of that is mental illness. About 10% of people who say those things are mentally ill the other 90% are trolling. So by banning the alt-right you are simply shutting up trolls who don&#039;t have real opinions anyway and you can spot mental health issues easier.

However, unlike the previous generation, they were never taught the fundamental rules of the internet, primarily: you should never reveal private info. Normies think that the internet is a giant playground where you make friends and share cool pictures and deep philosophical thoughts. But anyone who&#039;s been using the internet since the 1990&#039;s and\/or is knowledgeable in tech, knows that the internet is not some child-friendly place. For fuck&#039;s sake, a third of the internet is straight up porn (probably half if you include girls&#039; Facebook pics). Doxxing someone is easy as hell because their entire lives are online. What I&#039;m trying to say is that this place was never meant for normies, because they don&#039;t understand the ramifications of their actions online. I think the internet is actually a detriment to normies because they take everything seriously and literally (as if it is real life). They were never taught that this place is separate from their everyday lives and ought to remain that way.","filename":"fantasy and reality","ext":".jpg","w":1277,"h":849,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1493329455924,"time":1493329455,"md5":"T+D4\/VFaeKQ7pgvAEcni0A==","fsize":891556,"resto":0,"id":"20uJaEYe","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-internet-and-its-effects-on-society","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

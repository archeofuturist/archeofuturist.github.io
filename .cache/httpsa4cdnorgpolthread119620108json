First and foremost you need two things. 1. A strong business market. 2. A strong political power. I was an active user for Kekistan and unironically helping to secure land. There are way too many challenges to establishing a new country buy purchasing land from another country. Unless you have the first two points, it&#039;s simply not possible. I&#039;d suggest purchasing land in each other&#039;s countries or setting up legal churches and grow that way. If you don&#039;t believe me, start researching yourself. Most places to buy islands or land in other countries have high tax rates to foreigners and the locals will rob you at every turn.

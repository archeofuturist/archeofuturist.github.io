Russia knows this. It&#039;s not so bad that the playing field has been equalized per say due to one side of a civil war not having air power. This is a good way to get things settled down long enough to put a stable regime in place. This has been going on for 6 years and just provibg to be a refugee factory. It needs resolved to be honest.

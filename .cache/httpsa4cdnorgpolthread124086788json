The only reason I&#039;d be mad at this movie remake is if they added some gook to a story set on a train in the middle east. I&#039;m so sick of these historical revisions, trying to insert Asians into times in which we don&#039;t belong, just to squeeze an extra dollar out of their shitty movies. <br><br>Pic related. I honestly would accepted this if they had a token Dindu on their western possy, because it would actually be plausible (sorta). But the admission of a gook is unnecessary and completely unacceptable. Jewllywood is trying to make it so every single movie cast nowadays looks like a meeting of the fucking league of nations.

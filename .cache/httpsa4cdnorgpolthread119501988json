I mean I don&#039;t want to be taxed more than I already am. I&#039;m paying 25% of my income and almost 10% in sales tax. So universal health care would just take more and I would be even more poor than I already am.<br><br>But here is the thing. Two weeks ago I broke my collar bone and my manager told me to goto he hospital. They took a few x-rays and gave me a sling. It took less than 30 min. Then I was back at work. We&#039;ll I don&#039;t have health insurance and I got the bill today. It is 9 dollars short of $700! I can barely afford rent or bills, now I got his shit. Wtf!<br><br>So it does kinda look like socialized Healthcare does look like a good idea. But I can&#039;t pay for shit as it is cause I get taxed so much already. <br><br>What is your ideas on all this?

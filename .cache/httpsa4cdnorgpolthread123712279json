Despite what role-players will say about Communism being a global conspiracy to destroy them, the political ideology actually works best with this Abrahamic religion. Jesus himself set about prioritizing the needs of the meek, the poor, the sick, and the hungry, above all else. He spoke of sharing with those that were worse off than you, and making all men equal under the eyes of God, with no king or emperor to come between them. Despite the USSR&#039;s atheist policies, and the crimes of the early Bolsheviks, Christian Communism is on the rise, and of all of the religions, it fits this political system the best.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Nazi Germany: Islam. Regardless of the fact that Hitler himself was likely a pagan black sun worshipper, and\/or an atheist, he spoke ill of Christianity multiple times in private, and spoke greatly of Islam&#039;s heroism and power. He was very intrigued by its ideology and law, and had preferred that it became the religion of Germany instead. Nazi Germany was very Islamic in spirit, as it believed that the very strongest will survive, that their method was above all others, and they should dominate those deemed beneath them, or opposing them. The Germans saw Adolf as the closest thing to God, and submitted entirely to him. Islam means submission, and is a religion of conquering, dominance, and zero tolerance for other ideologies, similar to Nazi Germany.<\/span><br>Now before you stormcucks attack me for this, think how it can work in your favor. Use this argument on AntiFa\/Leftists to make them see that Christianity is indeed the communist way to have everyone be ((equal)), and point out how similar NatSoc Germany and Islam are. I am afraid that it is too late to convince the world AH was right, so you might as well make the shame of Germany useful in your arguments. <br><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; inb4 jew<\/span>","filename":"220px-Sickle_and_Cross","ext":".png","w":220,"h":211,"tn_w":220,"tn_h":211,"tim":1493691916341,"time":1493691916,"md5":"HxVsmdzj8CadQl4\/0prAmQ==","fsize":9807,"resto":0,"id":"ZBFFNpki","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"which-religions-best-fit-civilizations-of-the","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":1,"unique_ips":2},{"no":123712643,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)22:28:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123712279\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123712279<\/a><br>communism is a jewish religion for goys","filename":"juden","ext":".png","w":1102,"h":901,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":102,"tim":1493692080501,"time":1493692080,"md5":"MLUb12Ze\/TnWFtafvJd06w==","fsize":1628992,"resto":123712279,"id":"EGzyqyXD","country":"CA","m_img":1,"country_name":"Canada"}]}

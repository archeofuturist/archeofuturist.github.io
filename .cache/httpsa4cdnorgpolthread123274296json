That&#039;s what cultures are: the sum total of a people&#039;s oral, musical, pictographical, social, interpersonal, culinary, military, hierarchical, aesthetic moral language. Individuals who share the same &#039;language&#039; can work smoothly together without getting in one another&#039;s way in the same environment, by following the mutual behavioral shorthand that is their cultural norms. Cultural homogeneity in the basic areas of social life enables people to relegate such drudgery to the unconscious, freeing up their conscious minds for more sophisticated developments. This way, they accomplish more. They invent, explore, develop and civilize. <br><br>What do you think happens if you put people from a few drastically different cultures together and expect the system to keep working? The system jams, everywhere, often in ways the people can&#039;t predict or explain, because so many of the norms they follow are unconscious and taken for granted (that&#039;s why the cultural norms are useful in the first place, remember). Unable to articulate the nature of their frustration, the people begin to hate one another. Dysfunction becomes war, and the cultures suffer and die.<br><br>Small doses of cultural exchange can be very good on one condition: if pursued at leisure, voluntarily, by the individuals interested (and many of us are). <br><br>There is no excuse for physical diversity in workplaces or even in countries anymore. Now that we have the Internet, all the peoples of the world are free to engage in free, open, friendly cultural exchange whenever we like.

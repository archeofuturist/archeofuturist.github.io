He was the host and writer for Cosmos which is actually very neutral in tone and presents scientific fact in an intelligent and genuine way. His scientific books are also really well written and again devoid of any sort of bias for the most part (I own a copy of Pale Blue Dot, which is his best written work due to its structure and subject material).","time":1493034263,"resto":122573497,"id":"6P\/ITzig","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

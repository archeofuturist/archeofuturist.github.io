New energy sources or energy management or both would allow for extreme changes in the world. Scarcity of most resources would decrease to levels far below even that of what they are today. Not making money will not be as big of a deal as it is today. The world currently produces far more than enough food for every person on the planet to eat three times per day, however, the problem in large part is transportation\/distribution and of course greed\/profit (i.e. why feed someone when you don&#039;t earn money for it). It may sound like socialism\/communism to provide food for everyone on Earth without money being involved, however, the very fundamental nature of the political and resource climate after sentient AI will be stupendously different as advancements in technology will be so monumentally radical most people currently do not even have an even basic concept of it.

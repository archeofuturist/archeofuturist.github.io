I don&#039;t think the Normans were Nordic. By the time they invaded they had already intermarried with the local Franks. The Scandinavian genes were bred out by the third generation, there&#039;s really no evidence of the vikings settled there trying to keep their blood &quot;pure&quot;. They probably married locals to advance their position since the Franks had cavalry which was the bane of vikings. Can&#039;t settle an area if the locals dislike you and also have the capacity to wipe you out.<br>William might have been 8% pure Scandinavian, the rest being continental Germanic or remnants of Gallic.","time":1493595736,"resto":123542200,"id":"RF7Roevy","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

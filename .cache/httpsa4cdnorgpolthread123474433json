I just enjoy my freedom to much to ever want to go back.","time":1493563174,"resto":123474433,"id":"qH5T7EIQ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123484017,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)10:43:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123474433\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123474433<\/a><br>JEWS","time":1493563408,"resto":123474433,"id":"K\/v24ycU","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123484226,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)10:45:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123483674\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123483674<\/a><br>Is the racial divide real?","time":1493563543,"resto":123474433,"id":"mC4buKN9","country":"EE","country_name":"Estonia"},{"no":123484281,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)10:46:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123483674\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123483674<\/a><br>Somehow stupid vandalizing doesn&#039;t gets you in jail here.<br><br>It speaks a lot about a society priorities.","filename":"venezuela7","ext":".jpg","w":650,"h":433,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1493563580451,"time":1493563580,"md5":"814AKLB9OOLInZjUToK2Eg==","fsize":70557,"resto":123474433,"id":"eqoxddl\/","country":"CL","country_name":"Chile"},{"no":123484583,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)10:49:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123474433\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123474433<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;1 post by this ID<\/span><br><br>NO not again","time":1493563770,"resto":123474433,"id":"3KjgmUIp","country":"KR","country_name":"South Korea"},{"no":123484707,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)10:50:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123476492\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123476492<\/a><br>and single mothers.

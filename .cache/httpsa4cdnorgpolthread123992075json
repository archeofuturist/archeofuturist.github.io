There needs to be so many workers that the wages stay low.<br>You also need to strip or at least weaken the right of medical workers to go for a strike, basically make them medic slaves if need be.<br>Use state power to keep the wages low, prices from suppliers low, but at the same time try not kill the private medical industry that does stuff like drugs, syringes, mri-scanners and other devices.<br><br>And even with all that, despite the thing being entirely state run, you will have problems like doctors with expensive free education leaving to another countries for better wages.

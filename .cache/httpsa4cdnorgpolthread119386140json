I&#039;ve been on \/pol\/ since we were founded as a containment board. I advocated Trump with the best of them.<br><br>You&#039;re all really lost if you got here in the last two years or so. I&#039;m not advocating elitism or some undue opinions here; I&#039;m stating a fact that&#039;s become apparent since April 1.<br><br>On April 1, we had merged boards. MODS: Don&#039;t fucking delete this because it&#039;s a pony thread. I know you&#039;ve been doing that. My content has more to do with it than horsefucking.<br><br>April 1 was a board that lacked the shills, the posters who don&#039;t operate under any levels of irony who so plague this board here.<br><br>I have no interest in My Little Pony at all as a grown adult man. I want politically incorrect discussion. The MLP community was kind, open-minded, and autistic enough to keep out the uninitiated - the &quot;\/r\/The_Donald&quot; types - from infecting our board.<br><br>The union was great. Oldfags like me were posting about how great it was to finally feel like old\/b\/ again.<br><br>That can&#039;t happen with \/pol\/ anymore. \/pol\/ is infected with bots, shitposts, and arbitrary janitors. Just look at the catalog: &quot;America isn&#039;t whi-&quot; thread here, whitewashing thread there, &quot;\/pol\/ BTFO&quot;, memballs, strawmen, greentexts, and drunkposts about interracial relationships.<br><br>You&#039;re all blind to your destruction. You&#039;ll keep vargposting, merchant posting, Drumpfposting, and BLACKED posting, because you&#039;re all a fucking mess.<br><br>For the few of you who are a part of old\/pol\/ and are coming to see what I mean, mlpol is going to form on infinity soon. I think you should remember that. We want you.","filename":"1491198777128","ext":".png","w":1080,"h":1370,"tn_w":197,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491256298882,"time":1491256298,"md5":"NN2u\/ES5zO0OwRZ3C1XwGw==","fsize":649041,"resto":0,"id":"dtRqFI3+","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"pol-is-shit","country_name":"United States","replies":7,"images":3,"unique_ips":7},{"no":119387288,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)18:00:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119386140\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119386140<\/a><br>\/mlpol\/ was great temporarily because it was a breath of fresh air from the usual (you)posting.

It&#039;s all fuck you this and that with insults. Those of us numbed to internet, for me from getting a 2 year degree in \/b\/, we found great discussion and debated a lot of political issues. Actual conversation, what this thread is missing just like all of nupol. Bronies for the most part kept porn in porn threads which scared off the weak, aside from then occasional troll that would try it in a non-porn thread only to get not a single (you). Again unlike nupol where you take every bait and bump that garbage to top spots to the bump limit. The clop served a purpose and it did it quite well, apparently many in this thread are still upset and how effective it kept them at bay while great discussions and great fun was had. <br><br>Nupol sickens me, I can&#039;t even get past 6 threads into the catalog before I&#039;m done with this shillhole. So many of you stand up on your soapboxes screaming about \/pol\/ needs defending and purging, no it does not. We have given our enemies a solid place to attack and they have done so quite well. But it was our ideas, facts, truth and logic that made it a target. Those things are gone now as evidenced by the vitriol in this thread as we cut ourselves to pieces, exactly what the (((anarchy-commies))) are being coached to do. This is not how you win a war. <br><br>I have no problems walking away from this major loss and strategic blunder. Insult away on that and gloat, you know you&#039;ll enjoy it. But I take the ideas and spirit that made this place a target and that&#039;s how \/pol\/ will be victorious. These ideas worked great before the shill invasion, so there is no reason to let them waste time and money here when we can be elsewhere.

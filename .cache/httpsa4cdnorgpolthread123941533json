For the cost of their annual budget ($30 billion) they could build a Launch Loop, which would take launch costs from $2000\/kg to as little as $3\/kg. This would generate goodwill internationally and pay for itself within a few years just from launching satellites for other nations.<br><br>Due to increased light exposure and efficiency due to the cold, solar panels in space produce far more electricity, and run 24 hours a day with no need for a backup system like terrestrial solar. We could produce power for far less than the cost of coal.<br><br><br>Even better would be an Orbital Ring Space Elevator, which for about $400 billion would let us deploy payloads for around $1\/kg. Before you downvote and tell me we need carbon nanotubes, please read the article. This design only goes to low earth orbit, so it doesn&#039;t need superstrong materials like other Space Elevator designs you have heard of (and NASA invests millions of dollars investigating, knowing they can&#039;t be built yet).<br><br><br>In addition, it would allow us to connect tethers from solar power satellites directly to the ground. This decrease in transmission costs, along with the decreased costs of deploying satellits would let us produce power for less than 1 cent\/kwh.<br><br><br>If sold at 15c\/kwh (a discount to worldwide average electricity costs of 17c\/kwh), the satellites would pay themselves off in 1-2 years, and the market is well supported for massive increases in capacity at very modest cost discounts (i.e. drop the price even 1-2 c\/kwh and demand increases massively).<br><br><br>In the end, this means that every dollar invested into solar satellites would return at least 50% annually. It would be possible to start generating trillions of dollars in free cash flow within a few years. Enough to fund the entire government without taxes if we wanted. Enough to retire out debt, or create a basic income.<br><br>Yeah, NASA is a fraud.","filename":"NASA","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":333,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1493835495633,"time":1493835495,"md5":"G\/msqgAsMn4yk0bCe0A2Tg==","fsize":24875,"resto":0,"id":"Yi05Jdoy","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"nasa-is-fake","country_name":"United States","replies":11,"images":4,"unique_ips":5},{"no":123942053,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)14:23:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123941533\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123941533<\/a><br><br>NASA haven&#039;t been able to commit into long term projects since 60&#039;s and Apollo.

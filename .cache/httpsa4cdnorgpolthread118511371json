(Uncommon, I know) What if we could make a political movement in California- so radically pro-SJW and extreme leftist that no democrat candidate will ever appear as a viable option.<br><br>That a californian would have to vote for a californian candidate- the only person who would understand the needs of the SJWs in full.<br><br>No white candidates would be acceptable, no CIS candidates would meet their standards. Literally the only thing they would get out to vote for is some 40 year old homosexual transgender man.<br><br>Thus winning 2020 for the Right. 4 years to get it going on the clock.","filename":"new_california_republic_flag-1920x1200","ext":".jpg","w":1920,"h":1200,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":156,"tim":1490620585124,"time":1490620585,"md5":"0j7n3p8FjFBuZ22w0p9ugQ==","fsize":208992,"resto":0,"id":"Wxa1PUz1","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"hey-pol","country_name":"United States","replies":14,"images":6,"unique_ips":8},{"no":118511513,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)09:18:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118511371\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118511371<\/a><br>Do you like Nike?","time":1490620693,"resto":118511371,"id":"ST4ZiNq8","country":"JP","country_name":"Japan"},{"no":118511769,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)09:21:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118511513\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118511513<\/a><br>Sometimes I Just Do It, but usually thats from apathy towards the results.","time":1490620885,"resto":118511371,"id":"Wxa1PUz1","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118511784,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)09:21:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"alright. how do we start this?","time":1490620897,"resto":118511371,"id":"2RpB9Msn","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118511919,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)09:23:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118511371\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118511371<\/a><br>I think it would be easier and simpler to just meme Jefferson into existence.","filename":"jefferson-1485626765738","ext":".jpg","w":433,"h":439,"tn_w":123,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490620994226,"time":1490620994,"md5":"EYLvTCzvkE15FwniZiFa0Q==","fsize":37873,"resto":118511371,"id":"BEYx5btn","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118512241,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)09:27:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118511371\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118511371<\/a><br>If you faggots like California so much could you kindly stop moving to Texas?

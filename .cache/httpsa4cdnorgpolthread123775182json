I actually would agree with cuckboi Trudeau if he had just did it once and apologized, everybody overexagerates and says shit in error. <br><br>But the guy did it multiple times, and evidence shows that he knowingly lied. This is a code of ethics violation. <br><br>The only reason cuckboi didn&#039;t fire him is because he&#039;s a minority. Canada is all about identity poltics now in government, in fact the federal government practically gives people jobs now if they are a minority. The military, RCMP, CBSA, border services etc they all hire based on quotas. Much more qualified applicants get filtered out or have to wait much longer through the application processes just to get into those services, white men in particular (in many cases) either are stuck waiting 2 years to get in, or are canned at suitability panels. <br><br>The federal government here has a massive hard on for identity politics. Then when you get into those services you can grind your dick off 24\/7 never miss a shift, never have a sick day, have a shit ton of accomplishments but get promotions passed over you because you lack the proper genitalia or skin color. <br><br>I remember when this towel head was appointed. There were much more qualified candidates to choose from, none of whom were picked simply based on the fact Trudeau openly appointed his cabinet based on gender and skin color. In his mind he wants &quot;government to represent Canadians&quot; refusing to look at people individually, refuse to judge people equally, refusing to appoint the most qualified and best people to run the country. <br><br>The only good thing coming out of this is the fact cuckboi&#039;s approval ratings are dropping so fast lately that they are going to be in the 30% range soon.","filename":"1486205507005","ext":".jpg","w":751,"h":1534,"tn_w":61,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493737637166,"time":1493737637,"md5":"z2zq9PjfNC+8Ysdni6wXjA==","fsize":344607,"resto":123775182,"id":"\/3XPkxdy","country":"CA","m_img":1,"country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123776466,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)11:09:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"just a prank bro.","filename":"cacophanouslaughter","ext":".jpg","w":125,"h":125,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493737747603,"time":1493737747,"md5":"tSz5vv1MicH8gBVzxcaobQ==","fsize":2498,"resto":123775182,"id":"UrdXjHsh","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123776667,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)11:11:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"Sikhs are officially Jew-tier.<br>Who&#039;s idea was it to choose a Paki to lead a white military? <br>Probably a jew","filename":"1491851532401","ext":".jpg","w":300,"h":300,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493737872693,"time":1493737872,"md5":"VGvOiF\/YOvPmji7kH2\/+HA==","fsize":22180,"resto":123775182,"id":"rAhwT\/Rb","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123776691,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)11:11:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;That&#039;s what Canadians expect when someone makes a mistake<\/span><br><br>So when does someone apologize for Trudeau?","time":1493737885,"resto":123775182,"id":"7emMgvLk","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123776784,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)11:12:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123776667\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123776667<\/a><br>But T_D says Sikhs are FUCKING BASED","time":1493737942,"resto":123775182,"id":"7emMgvLk","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123776991,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)11:14:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123775267\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123775267<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;minister of defense is a stolen valor<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;pretended to be the head master plan while it&#039;s not true<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;vets and military are pissed off at him<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;said sorry but dodges every questions<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;trudeau said he is a good goy and have 100% trust in him<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;opposition want him to quit<\/span>","time":1493738069,"resto":123775182,"id":"KSGyndfZ","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123777046,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)11:15:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"Don&#039;t think its a crime to tell tall tales<br>Pretty fucking normal to embellish these sorts of stories","time":1493738105,"resto":123775182,"id":"1QFWOFmP","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123777182,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)11:16:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123777046\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123777046<\/a><br>yeah completely normal when youre the head of the military to lie for 0 reason and make your men pissed at you","time":1493738188,"resto":123775182,"id":"HqUDsqkf","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123777319,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)11:18:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123777046\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123777046<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Pretty fucking normal to embellish these sorts of stories<\/span><br><br>How many years did you serve in any military and in what capacity?","time":1493738286,"resto":123775182,"id":"V2hi+B0q","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123777384,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)11:18:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123777182\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123777182<\/a><br>He&#039;s an affirmative action appointment, ofc people will be upset at him","time":1493738322,"resto":123775182,"id":"1QFWOFmP","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123777485,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)11:19:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123777046\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123777046<\/a><br>id agree in a bar scenario, but in this case he was out of line.

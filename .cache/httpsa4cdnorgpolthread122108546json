I am certain that mainstream media has taken leads from \/pol\/ and sourced stories from here, and I&#039;m not just talking about the sensational ones. I know for a fact that myself and others have influenced peoples religious awareness here and even been instrumental in persuading them to seek direction from one of the Christian Religious Traditions. What bothers me though is how this precious vent of otherwise peripheral political opinion is wasted.<br><br>In this age of the Internet and the free movement of information a forum such as this could become a beacon of free speech, but because of the rabid hatred that&#039;s spewed here it is a pariah. It&#039;s not gone unnoticed by me that any thread that shows signs of having real substance in a world of illusion and distraction can and does get pruned, it&#039;s nevertheless interesting that they are still often archived. They make interesting reading while they&#039;re up though and it&#039;s why I keep coming back.<br><br>So this is an appeal to informed, historically aware people with a decent memory of recent contemporary events going back to the breakdown in US\/Russia relationships to offer a concise appraisal of what they&#039;ve noticed and where they see these events leading. I&#039;ve been predicting War since the mid nineties and if anyone picks this up I&#039;ll tell you why.<br><br>God is Great","filename":"reset to overcharge","ext":".jpg","w":885,"h":516,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":145,"tim":1492757574612,"time":1492757574,"md5":"jfSdxbZQ\/PSwXA00RhBE4A==","fsize":61978,"resto":0,"id":"Ol\/m9e0T","country":"PL","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"pol-is-a-priceless-forum-where-its-permitted-to","country_name":"Poland","replies":18,"images":4,"unique_ips":10},{"no":122108812,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)02:56:09","name":"Yup","com":"Yup","time":1492757769,"resto":122108546,"id":"++corVHY","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122109000,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)02:58:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"I haven&#039;t scrutinized the details of the events, but what do Russia and the US gain through any conflict?

At the end of the Cold War there needed to be a complete removal of the actors who played roles within the Cold War. These people&#039;s moral, philosophical and Political compass was set and, as we are seeing, impossible to change. The only way they could interpret the New political dynamic at the end of the Nineties was with themselves still in their respective camps attempting to rebrand and re-educate.<br><br>Another thing that comes from a look back through history is that the Wars that took place in the twentieth century all find their Origins in the Enlightenment and the birth of philosophical and political ideologies that were established as received truth at that time. In short all the major powers of the period (See European) have been fighting over, &quot;What is Reality&quot;. The simple confluence of analysis of this question is that none of them have the credentials or authority to determine what that is, and so, a study of what *actual* Reality is should be sought.","filename":"flipcat","ext":".jpg","w":887,"h":901,"tn_w":123,"tn_h":124,"tim":1492759230535,"time":1492759230,"md5":"bjobC3BFCyqHmK3Yih9BNQ==","fsize":96616,"resto":122108546,"id":"Ol\/m9e0T","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":122110572,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)03:21:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122109499\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122109499<\/a><br>The races are NOT equal<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;see: IQ scores, history, any major city<\/span><br>Islam is NOT peaceful<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;see: any Islamic country<\/span><br>The holocaust is at least exaggerated <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;see: lampshades, BBQ coasters, jerkoff machines, 11 gorillion<\/span><br>Hitler is possible the most lied about person in history<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;see: everything above<\/span><br><br>Real life forces people to lie, we demand truth that is all.

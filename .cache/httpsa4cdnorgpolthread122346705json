In this case we&#039;re talking about a river, not land. So if there are boats traveling down the river, they have the property rights necessary for river travel or what is termed the &#039;right of way&#039;. If someone builds a low bridge blocking their boats from traveling down the river they are blocking the boat owners right of way and they can be prosecuted. Now the exact height above the river the boat owners would own for their &#039;right of way&#039; depends entirely upon the types of boats required for traveling down the river. Just google Lockean homesteading, Hans Hermann Hoppe covers it in detail.","time":1492911771,"resto":122346705,"id":"\/KK96dWM","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

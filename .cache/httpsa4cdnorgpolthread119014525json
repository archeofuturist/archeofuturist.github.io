It&#039;s one thing to fantasize about that shit from a distance, it&#039;s just escapism, but actually living it can&#039;t be too satisfying. I mean fuck, ask anyone involved in the Donbass crisis in Ukraine or Arab Spring. I mean really, you can probably find someone on \/int\/ who was involved. <br><br>I mean I understand your feeling, I&#039;ve felt it myself, I think it&#039;s some kind of atavism that&#039;s just hardwired into our makeup.

Imagine being in Syria right now, at the age of like 22-23, fighting for the Assad regime against some death cult in the Northern part of your homelands. Imagine the glory and passion you would feel to fight for a cause like that. Men for centuries lived their lives as warriors. I think we are natural warriors and I think living without fighting to a certain extent is unhealthy. <br><br>Men need an crave purpose. What greater purpose in life could there be than pledging your life to kill and die for a cause?

I&#039;m a second-generation Punjabi-American and I hate how the party that wants to disarm me, censor my speech, over-tax me, defend the Antifa and BLM thugs that wish to do me harm, and flood my country (the greatest country on earth) with Muslims that do not share our values is also the party that claims to be looking out for me! This idea that the Democrats are the part of non-whites needs to die for the good of non-white Americans. First off it feeds into the idea that the left wants to flood the country with non-whites that will vote for them regardless of what happens so that they can have a dependable voting bloc that they can use to stay in power. If this continues then my family and many of my friends will be seen as nothing more than the tools of criminals that seek to rape our country. Secondly the left wishes to make non-whites (and Muslims especially) a protected class. This is how tolerance dies. This is not asking for equality, this is asking for supremacy over the white man and I don&#039;t want this. When the white man&#039;s only two options are submission or hatred can you really blame him for choosing hatred? We must do away with hate crime laws and affirmative action so that we can have real equality. The killings of Sikhs by white men in this country will not stop when some blue-haired leftist tells rednecks that racism is wrong; it will stop when we are respected as equals and this can only be done by us doing good work and enriching the lives of all Americans by contributing to the arts and sciences.","filename":"Sikh of Islamic Terrorism","ext":".jpg","w":654,"h":875,"tn_w":186,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491187535748,"time":1491187535,"md5":"oJqCQ5+Ss2whsEDbiAaPWA==","fsize":120267,"resto":0,"id":"vv9DPQu4","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"how-do-we-end-the-democrats-stranglehold-on","country_name":"United States","replies":21,"images":1,"unique_ips":19},{"no":119280957,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)22:46:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119280854\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119280854<\/a><br>bump for you.<br><br>spread the word.

Even Victor Orban said that. And they also view Islam as a sledgehammer against capitalism and the non whites as instruments of class warfare.

Creating a global slave caste with an ultra-rich plutocracy. Teaching socialism to discourage competition. The promotion of homosexuality AND Islam at the same time seems illogical and contradictory at first, but NOT if you really take it serious that they DO want to dismantle western society.

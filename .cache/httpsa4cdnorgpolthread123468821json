The silent generation had WWI, the great depression, and then WWII to live through. The greatest generation had WWII. Boomers were born after WWII when the US was the only industrialized power not bombed to shit or taken over by commies (Argentina). Boomers were incredibly sheltered from what most of the world is like, ie, violence, shit in the streets, and rape. They grew up in a 90% white society, with almost no challenges. They can&#039;t even comprehend what it&#039;s like to be surrounded by non-Europeans who are incompetent when they&#039;re not intentionally malevolent.<br><br>Does this mean they have it easier? On an outward level, yes. They&#039;ve had more material comfort and pleasure than probably any people who have ever lived, except perhaps royalty, and even that is questionable: most royals in history didn&#039;t even have what we would consider proper toilets. However, inwardly they&#039;re probably more racked with pain than any generation ever. Their worldview centers around themselves. They get confused and turn to rage easily. They refuse any information that doesn&#039;t conform with what they already know and every day they&#039;re being attacked by more and more of it. Their parents are ashamed of them, their children hate them. Many boomers have no real friends, many are divorced and have been denied access to their children. If they&#039;ve paid any attention at all, they&#039;ve seen their country almost completely destroyed. Their children or grandchildren are nuts. Boomers have compromised their morals a million times and continue to do so and each defeat is a spiritual death.<br><br>TL; DR Yes, boomers have had it easier than any generation in the history of the world. Because of that they have not learned to suffer and to push back against the world in meaningful ways, hence the useless &quot;marches&quot; which they did for Vietnam and continue to do today. They refuse the truth and because of that have destroyed their souls.","filename":"Smug brunette","ext":".jpg","w":366,"h":290,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":99,"tim":1493557181012,"time":1493557181,"md5":"i4q7ewa6hWC6PVgovxlmzg==","fsize":81023,"resto":123468821,"id":"O1ygt8PB","country":"CL","country_name":"Chile"},{"no":123475169,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)09:00:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123468821\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123468821<\/a><br>Read &quot;The Fourth Turning&quot; by Stauss and Howe.

There is no promotion in most manual labor industries and all managers are required from outside (spoiler they have college degrees).

Savings account do not have interest now a days in the US. So, if I put $1000 in a CD in 2000 and let it sit till today I would have ~$1270. Adjusting $1000 in 2000 for inflation equals $1417.

I made an account on POF, and I wanted to see who would message me first, so for 2 weeks, all I did was log in so people would see me online, and got 12 messages. No white women. I would give myself a 7 and I had some good pictures up. What gives? 8 of them were black and 4 were dark skin Hispanic. A lot of white women viewed my profile, but none messaged me first.

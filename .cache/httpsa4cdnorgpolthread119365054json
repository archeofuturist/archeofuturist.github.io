The opposite is true: British multiculturalists are feeding Islamic fundamentalism. Above all, Londonistan, with its new 423 mosques, is built on the sad ruins of English Christianity.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The Hyatt United Church was bought by the Egyptian community to be converted to a mosque. St Peter\u2019s Church has been converted into the Madina Mosque. The Brick Lane Mosque was built on a former Methodist church. Not only buildings are converted, but also people. The number of converts to Islam has doubled; often they embrace radical Islam, as with Khalid Masood, the terrorist who struck Westminster.<\/span><br><br>http:\/\/www.breitbart.com\/london\/201<wbr>7\/04\/02\/gatestone-institute-423-new<wbr>-mosques-500-closed-churches-london<wbr>\/?utm_source=facebook&amp;utm_medium=so<wbr>cial","filename":"GettyImages-528038130-640x480","ext":".png","w":640,"h":480,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1491246040016,"time":1491246040,"md5":"Ne3bL8qvRZnlWs+AA37G8A==","fsize":174157,"resto":0,"id":"8deGAuGK","country":"IE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"london-yes","country_name":"Ireland","replies":19,"images":3,"unique_ips":17},{"no":119365497,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)15:03:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119365054\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119365054<\/a><br>Uk is actually the most cucked country of Europe.","time":1491246232,"resto":119365054,"id":"9mFbN0kg","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":119365700,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)15:05:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=U6m<wbr>Gng9NTKU","time":1491246318,"resto":119365054,"id":"HF2N72N\/","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":119366089,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)15:08:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119365054\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119365054<\/a><br>serves the eternal anglo right for decades of imperialism","time":1491246498,"resto":119365054,"id":"QkOyIXwG","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119366476,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)15:11:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119365700\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119365700<\/a><br>Holy shit","time":1491246683,"resto":119365054,"id":"8deGAuGK","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"},{"no":119367742,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)15:21:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119365054\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119365054<\/a><br><br>Everyone knows that the prophet Muhamed PBUH advocating for the striking of fear into the hearts of disbelievers had NOTHING to do with Islam.<br><br>Islamophobes get off my board!!!

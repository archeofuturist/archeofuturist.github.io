In older Germanic languages the latter construction would&#039;ve been more standard (just look at old Viking kennings) but in the last centuries the former is because grammar in most West Germanic language has eased a lot (like in most Indo-European languages, we use a lot more &#039;connecting words&#039; than relying on complex grammatical constructions)<br><br>In Dutch people often call trashcans &#039;Turkenflat&#039; jokingly, whilst &#039;Turkse flat&#039; would be more conventional.

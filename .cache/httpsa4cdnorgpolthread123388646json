He kept talking about globalism being bad. It really is one of the worst betrayals on this level if it is all what it appears to be. Maybe Trump just wants to be the last president or something and doesnt give a shit what happens, like he&#039;s just pressing random buttons in a nuclear sub panel seeing what happens like some total dipshit. He&#039;s really trying to piss off his strongest supporters, it&#039;s just bizarre. Then again the general public is majority retard at this point and he did directly tell us he could murder someone in cold blood on camera and people would still support him. I actually believe that.

I&#039;ve posted this before, but I can&#039;t help but say it again because the shills have you demoralized. <br><br>Have faith, \/pol\/. They&#039;ve already lost.<br><br>Here&#039;s the news. You won. You think it&#039;s going to last 8 years you&#039;re wrong. The swing right starts now and lasts not 8 years, not 30 years as some here have predicted but to this point it&#039;s lasted and stayed strong for 70 years.<br><br>There are movies made about you, they&#039;re positive. Hollywood is \/pol\/ positive. Trump went down as the greatest leader the world has ever known and future governments have been modeled after his. <br><br>the media of this age has reformed totally thanks to Trump and the success of the administrations that follow in his image. Every movie made about this age is pro trump anti-media. The deep state elites are exposed for pumping propaganda in the media and paying shills to post on sites like this and facebook.<br><br>celebrate \/pol\/, it&#039;s better than you think.","filename":"0ihb2","ext":".jpg","w":283,"h":262,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":231,"tim":1492052941319,"time":1492052941,"md5":"8HLbnn7M\/7h3Bv8\/\/9v9Vg==","fsize":25520,"resto":0,"id":"KqApYuVB","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"hey-pol-ive-posted-this-before-but-i-cant-help","country_name":"United States","replies":6,"images":2,"unique_ips":6},{"no":120859473,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)23:19:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120858281\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120858281<\/a><br>TEMPUS EDAX RERUM<br>Good luck, John.","time":1492053574,"resto":120858281,"id":"hmTeTvsJ","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120859667,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)23:21:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"This is a timeline I can get behind","filename":"KEK","ext":".jpg","w":236,"h":236,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492053673452,"time":1492053673,"md5":"Wk81ttv9CKqWF+oK5vFqvg==","fsize":9193,"resto":120858281,"id":"Koe7FqJm","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120859669,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)23:21:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120858281\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120858281<\/a><br>Nice one John.","time":1492053674,"resto":120858281,"id":"UsUJYEG9","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120860195,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)23:26:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"As encouraging as this is, I&#039;m also suspicious that this is a LARPer trying to get us to lower our guards.","filename":"awoo squid","ext":".png","w":545,"h":700,"tn_w":97,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492053980082,"time":1492053980,"md5":"hT+k3J64TAxncKyZ\/x2ZEg==","fsize":376432,"resto":120858281,"id":"huUUOfXG","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120860299,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)23:27:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120860195\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120860195<\/a><br>More likely a LARPer trying to moralize us.","time":1492054036,"resto":120858281,"id":"Koe7FqJm","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120860553,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)23:29:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"k. keep me posted","time":1492054180,"resto":120858281,"id":"0N+Bgj2i","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

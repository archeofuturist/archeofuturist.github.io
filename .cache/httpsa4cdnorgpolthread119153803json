(assuming this is in any way true which there is obviously no evidence for) Hillary Clinton made it clear during the campaign she considers Russia an enemy. The US does plenty to try and influence foreign elections, its kind of a thing. If the people are so easily manipulated by the ideas of these big bad Russians (allegedly) then is it not fair game? I mean obviously I would prefer zero foreign influence in our elections but it happens from more countries than just Russia, were just fixing on that because of our history and they make an easy boogeyman for the left to point at. <br><br>There is no evidence of anything hard the Russians have done to rig the election. No proof they were behind John Podestas emails or anything like that, so where is the fire?<br><br>Its been widely know especially around these parts that Israel funds similar propaganda groups to influence public opinion on the internet and likely did on behalf of Hillary as well as intel agencies in Germany, France, etc<br><br>This is such a partisan hit job right in everyone&#039;s faces and its kind of sickening","filename":"91v7t5tup2yx","ext":".jpg","w":800,"h":430,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":134,"tim":1491027879239,"time":1491027879,"md5":"NNx4uyxgKJhdsUMEt8qsVg==","fsize":90858,"resto":0,"id":"iqJAGuDe","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"guys-please-just-answer-this-one-simple-question","country_name":"United States","replies":14,"images":5,"unique_ips":8},{"no":119154411,"now":"04\/01\/17(Sat)02:32:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"See im asking you a simple question and you cant answer it.","filename":"fox_ff_cartoons_140921c-800x430","ext":".jpg","w":800,"h":430,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":67,"tim":1491028323383,"time":1491028323,"md5":"v1tqj1faoXJra\/z3oh2Buw==","fsize":85046,"resto":119153803,"id":"iqJAGuDe","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119155241,"now":"04\/01\/17(Sat)02:42:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119153803\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119153803<\/a><br><br>Tucker is a God among men.

I&#039;d also get a small mill for turning trees into planks, wood takes awhile to cure so it will be awhile until you can startvusing it but a small tree removal service can provide you with materials to work with while also bringing in a profit, if you get good at wood working local furniture outlets often offer good commissions for handcrafted goods. Simple things like cutting boards can also bring in a tiny bit of money at farmers markets type places and you can boost that income by adding a little bit of extra effort like staining them and monogramming them with a wood burner.

They&#039;re pretty infestant.<br>Chestnuts are a bit more fragile but once they get going they&#039;re unstoppable too.<br>In my experience a single large adult walnut or chestnut can produce up to 50kg of nuts. <br><br>That&#039;s more than you could possibly ever eat, enough to trade with neighbours. And they require virtually no maintenance. Just make sure no ivy grows on them.<br><br>Infestants should also be taken into account.<br>For example blackberries are EXTREMELY infestant here in Italy. You literally can&#039;t get rid of them, they just never fucking die whatever you do to them. <br>When they&#039;re in season (2-3 months a year) you have significant amounts of easily harvested fruit that again requires no maintenance at all.<br><br>Have nature work for you, if you can.","time":1493419456,"resto":123245370,"id":"vTo8zqYU","country":"IT","country_name":"Italy"},{"no":123257969,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)18:45:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"great post guys, looking to drop off the grid myself","time":1493419519,"resto":123245370,"id":"0DqKBtl4","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123258456,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)18:48:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123257836\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123257836<\/a><br><br>you&#039;re right they should have included nuts in some of them.<br>I&#039;m pretty much out of them now though.<br>I wasn&#039;t collecting them obessively just sporadically.<br>Will look out for some nut info.<br>Also hedging young trees can help with production\/collection of nuts too I believe.","time":1493419737,"resto":123245370,"id":"BmF5HqOl","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123258645,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)18:50:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123257357\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123257357<\/a><br><br>Well sure, but a tiller like that goes for 5-600\u20ac, not the thousands a 40 years old tractor would go for or the tens of thousands for a new one.<br><br>Realistically you&#039;d also want a motorized wheelbarrow to carry firewood and such around.<br>I&#039;m clearing a pretty large patch of forest from storm damage by hand and just getting the fucking wood out to the road below (10-20m) is grueling work.<br>I&#039;d certainly never want to carry firewood by hand more than 50m.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;pic related is most of the work I did last time<\/span>","filename":"IMAG0374","ext":".jpg","w":3264,"h":1952,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":74,"tim":1493419812407,"time":1493419812,"md5":"VmKL3aAu7pqLM2Vdtd30EQ==","fsize":1198203,"resto":123245370,"id":"vTo8zqYU","country":"IT","m_img":1,"country_name":"Italy"},{"no":123259112,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)18:53:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123258645\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123258645<\/a><br><br>shit man that&#039;s tough work.<br>You thought about splitting the logs on site using maul and wedges?","time":1493420024,"resto":123245370,"id":"BmF5HqOl","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123259349,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)18:55:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123258456\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123258456<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Also hedging young trees can help with production\/collection of nuts too I believe.<\/span><br><br>Sure, but why bother?

I&#039;d also get a small mill for turning trees into planks, wood takes awhile to cure so it will be awhile until you can startvusing it but a small tree removal service can provide you with materials to work with while also bringing in a profit, if you get good at wood working local furniture outlets often offer good commissions for handcrafted goods. Simple things like cutting boards can also bring in a tiny bit of money at farmers markets type places and you can boost that income by adding a little bit of extra effort like staining them and monogramming them with a wood burner.

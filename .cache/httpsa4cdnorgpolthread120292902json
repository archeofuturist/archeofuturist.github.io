I don&#039;t think this is all-out war and &quot;betrayal&quot; as you term it. If the US really wanted to take out assad, they could&#039;ve done so in a lightning strike, hitting multiple targets of strategic importance (moar airbases, AA sites, command posts, troop concentrations) and they would have the advantage of being able to mass troops and equipment in advance without arousing much suspicion, cuz muh isis (gg to clinton and obongo on that). I think this is to show to the chinese (whom he was negotiating with) that The Don can be trigger-happy when he needs to. Also, this does a pretty good job of stifling, if not silencing, the MUH RUSSIA bullshit. An added bonus is giving Assad a slap on the wrist and showing that he&#039;s not as weak as King Dindu before him. As for the gas, i think that it was delivered by the turkroach backed opposition forces and is of the Libyan stock which was plundered by clinton after &quot;democracy was restored&quot; in Libya. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;inb4 GO BACK TO THE r\/thedonald SHILL!!!<\/span><br><br>chill your shit, mongoloid, i&#039;ve never even been on reddit.<br><br>(Honestly, i might be wrong and trump&#039;s kike son-in-law maybe behind this as in pic related.

There\u2019s a problem, though: It might not help. Research suggests that most people don\u2019t choose lighter meals after seeing calorie information on menus. Many consumers don\u2019t even notice it.<br><br>Restaurants, meanwhile, have learned to game the system, highlighting their lowest-calorie options \u2014 like salads without dressing \u2014 to improve their numbers. And it\u2019s hard to be precise about calorie counts, raising questions about how useful the data are in the first place.<br><br>But there\u2019s reason to believe the requirements could help make Americans healthier eaters. While it might not change a diner\u2019s mind as he or she considers a menu board, it might inspire a healthier choice later, or the diner might head to a different restaurant the next time, and that possibility is motivating restaurants to make changes.<br><br>While chains have been reluctant to touch popular menu items for fear of turning off their regulars, the new requirements have prompted them to add healthier options. Some experts say it\u2019s industry choices, not consumer habits, that will really improve America\u2019s weight problem. Others insist consumers will have the final say.<br><br>Restaurants \u201cwill do what they have to do, but they\u2019re not going to compromise the brand,\u201d said Bonnie Riggs, restaurant industry analyst for NPD Group. \u201cPeople can walk into a fast-food restaurant with good intentions, and when they get there good intentions go out the window sometimes.\u201d","filename":"fiveguys","ext":".jpg","w":450,"h":285,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":158,"tim":1492432721335,"time":1492432721,"md5":"XbdeJ2038Mlh7ZRX7AaxNA==","fsize":156674,"resto":0,"id":"j8MXcaYi","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"can-mandatory-calorie-counting-thin-the-burger","country_name":"United States","replies":77,"images":10,"unique_ips":45},{"no":121520903,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)08:40:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"I didn&#039;t read your post but FUCK I want a burger.","time":1492432817,"resto":121520754,"id":"sf9B5wgp","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121521103,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)08:42:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121520754\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121520754<\/a><br>What would get rid of the fatasses is putting a chemical in burgers that causes people to become sterile.

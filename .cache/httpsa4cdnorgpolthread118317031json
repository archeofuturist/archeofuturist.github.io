I find by making idle chit chat and throwing out small redpills until they show interest in a certain area. Talk about issues that are most likely effecting them, when you see they show interest in that certain topic then you can drop little redpills at a time to test their perception. If they show interest then push it a bit farther to a point where they are satisfied with your response yet are still hungry for more information.","time":1490501705,"resto":118317031,"id":"7wJxt\/+Z","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118318331,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)00:17:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"A few weeks ago I was walking back home after a very lovely jog, when this woman ran up to me and was like, &quot;hey can you help me, this guy is following me.

You fags didn&#039;t care throughout the election when &quot;shills&quot; told you he was a lying sack of shit conman and now you&#039;re complaining. Fuck everyone that supported Trump throughout 2015-2016. You all contributed to this even though the signs were all there. Stop complaining and take personal responsibility for fucking us all over.","filename":"AverageTrumptard","ext":".png","w":960,"h":576,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":150,"tim":1491744628196,"time":1491744628,"md5":"6M3kMZzAVbx+UC3vWdZ0yQ==","fsize":231169,"resto":0,"id":"tnlFGNYJ","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"why-is-anyone-surprised-by-trumps-actions-you","country_name":"United States","replies":3,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":120282185,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)09:31:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120282099\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120282099<\/a><br>0.50 has been deposited into your account.","time":1491744698,"resto":120282099,"id":"Ko+e7lbQ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120282434,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)09:34:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120282099\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120282099<\/a><br>he hasn&#039;t lied to me. he still has 8 years","time":1491744866,"resto":120282099,"id":"8a4iiMZJ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120282436,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)09:34:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120282185\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120282185<\/a><br>By who?

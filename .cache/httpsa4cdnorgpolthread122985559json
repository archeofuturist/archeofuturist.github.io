I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn\u2019t want to be a douche and bother him and ask him to teach me about electrons or anything.<br>He said, \u201cOh, like you\u2019re doing now?\u201d<br>I was taken aback, and all I could say was \u201cBill?\u201d but he kept cutting me off and going \u201cBILL? BILL? BILL?\u201d and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen beakers filled with colorful liquid in his hands without paying.<br>The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like \u201cSir, you need to have a degree in biology.\u201d At first he kept pretending to be a scientist and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.<br>When she took one of the beakers and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually \u201cto prevent any science denial,\u201d and then turned around and winked at me. I don\u2019t even think that\u2019s a real thing. After she scanned each beaker and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by mixing the solutions really loudly.","time":1493262773,"resto":122985559,"id":"y6t5cIjT","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122986708,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)23:16:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122986321\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122986321<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;BILL BILL BILL<\/span><br><br>VERY nice","time":1493262974,"resto":122985559,"id":"522laMK7","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122986980,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)23:18:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122985559\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122985559<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mr. Science<\/span><br>he&#039;s just an actor","filename":"beakman","ext":".jpg","w":447,"h":450,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493263122410,"time":1493263122,"md5":"MgdJ4L6RVOyQDYeYCiH\/+w==","fsize":75988,"resto":122985559,"id":"3tb0t1uM","country":"CO","country_name":"Colombia"},{"no":122987049,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)23:19:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"97% of people polled would say hes a scientist","time":1493263155,"resto":122985559,"id":"yZVIqzCE","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122987124,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)23:19:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122986321\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122986321<\/a><br><br>wow! he sounds like a douche bag! yikes<br><br><a href=\"#p122985559\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122985559<\/a><br>because the elite cultural marxists are fucking terrified of loosing their millennial mindcucks that they are regressing the population to a more susceptible and unquestioning mindset, <br>honestly, I&#039;m not even sure that Bi Nill knows it yet","filename":"Yuri1","ext":".jpg","w":399,"h":398,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":124,"tim":1493263194859,"time":1493263194,"md5":"tl3L9TKy9xC2FBQehZjrrw==","fsize":35800,"resto":122985559,"id":"Oc9D0lsY","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122987173,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)23:20:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122986321\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122986321<\/a><br>Keked","time":1493263214,"resto":122985559,"id":"u5l4hA1l","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122987431,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)23:22:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122986321\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122986321<\/a><br>very good adaptation kiddo, very nicely meemd. have your le upvoat, and le gold! i hope you have a good day good sire, i wihs you well in your future memeeings","time":1493263356,"resto":122985559,"id":"V89HYfIl","country":"PA","country_name":"Panama"},{"no":122987698,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)23:24:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"The fact that Nye is not a scientist is kinda the point.

Hunting, for example, is pretty strongly justified with the amount of land that needs to be conserved and the amount of money it brings to conservation efforts. <br><br>Eating meat takes more land and many more resources per calorie compared to a vegetarian diet and is overall much worse for the environment. I like meat and don&#039;t want to stop eating it, but I can&#039;t really logically justify the hypocrisy in my position. <br><br>The only argument I have really feels like mental gymnastics: Since most of the domestic animals raised to be food are creations of man, man is entitled to do whatever we want to them. But that position makes it so cruelty to dogs (dogfighting for example) is acceptable and zoos are not, which I disagree with on both counts.<br><br>With my views, is there anyway I can eat meat and not be a hypocrite?","filename":"cow","ext":".jpg","w":800,"h":500,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":156,"tim":1491680790189,"time":1491680790,"md5":"foQMOxY7BnTjWIgdgpQNCw==","fsize":118676,"resto":0,"id":"58pfmSk5","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"how-do-i-morally-justify-eating-meat-if-i","country_name":"United States","replies":27,"images":3,"unique_ips":18},{"no":120173643,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)15:49:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120173302\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120173302<\/a><br>Hunt your own meat then.","time":1491680962,"resto":120173302,"id":"XaizzWrB","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120173840,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)15:50:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"Yes.

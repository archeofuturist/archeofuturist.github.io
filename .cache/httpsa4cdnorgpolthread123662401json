She misses these days and doesn&#039;t allow to criticize communism too harshly. Well, I understand her because there are many reasons for nostalgia 1. The absolutely awful gangster 90s. After the SU collapsed, there had been real anarchy for about 20 years: &#039;kill or get killed&#039; mentality, oligarchs ripped the working class off, no salaries, no money to buy food. I remember begging my father to buy me a chocolate bar, and he said we can&#039;t afford such a luxury, it was 1998-99. There are many stories from that period that would make you cringe. 2. The stability of the SU: you could get higher education free if you had passed all the exams, get a job with 100% certainty, housing issue was more difficult, you kinda had to wait your turn, same with a car. My grandparents got a flat pretty easily because it was in Kazakhstan and my grandad was a superb worker. No degenerate culture. Food deficit (pic), bad healthcare, good education, as far as I understand. Alcoholism was common, no drugs until the fall of the iron curtain.","filename":"bread","ext":".jpg","w":900,"h":591,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":82,"tim":1493676165357,"time":1493676165,"md5":"Brj9X+ars0gmHubQIjInlQ==","fsize":166980,"resto":123662401,"id":"eUyhnypZ","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":123680279,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)18:03:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123676126\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123676126<\/a><br>Hopefully it triggers pakis<br><a href=\"#p123677008\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123677008<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Ive never read 1984 but quote it<\/span>","time":1493676226,"resto":123662401,"id":"nJwJCkIY","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123680319,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)18:04:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123662401\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123662401<\/a><br>The only good commie is the dead commie!","filename":"SOCIALISMKasparovVsSocialism","ext":".png","w":525,"h":296,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1493676246334,"time":1493676246,"md5":"qKd6Gtdu2INj039bXks6fQ==","fsize":25869,"resto":123662401,"id":"XBRGtOjt","country":"CO","country_name":"Colombia"},{"no":123680373,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)18:04:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123679948\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123679948<\/a><br>Can we just have a few of your off duty cops?

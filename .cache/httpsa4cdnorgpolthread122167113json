So he spent a week trying to get himself out of the program. This little boy attempted to convince the teacher, the principal\u2014anybody who would listen\u2014that the test results were in error, that he really didn\u2019t belong there. We learned about it at the first PTA meeting. His teacher pulled us aside and told us that \u2018Chris marches to a different drummer.\u2019 She just shook her head.\u201d&quot;<\/span><br><br>__________<br><br>On McCandless&#039;s personality as a child<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;\u201cEven when we were little,\u201d says Carine, who was born three years after Chris, \u201che was very to himself. He wasn\u2019t antisocial\u2014 he always had friends, and everybody liked him\u2014but he could go off and entertain himself for hours. He didn\u2019t seem to need toys or friends.

Buck was fast, and he\u2019d always beat Chris home when they went running. I remember Chris was so excited the first time he made it home before Buckley. He went tearing all over the house yelling \u2018I beat Buck!

[...] in our tent, Chris and I would curl up in our hunter-green and navy-blue sleeping bags, the soft linings covered with pictures of mallard ducks. On particularly cold nights we&#039;d zip them together, and Chris would whisper, &quot;Carine! Shh. Listen... I&#039;m pretty sure there&#039;s an alien outside our tent.&quot; Depending on my mood, and on the level of noise in the forest, I would either panic or laugh.&quot;<\/span><br><br>__________<br><br><br>On McCandless&#039;s relationship with his sister<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;They\u2019d been best friends from an early age, spending hours together building forts out of cushions and blankets in their Annandale living room. \u201cHe was always really nice to me,\u201d Carine says, \u201cand extremely protective. He\u2019d hold my hand when we walked down the street.

But despite his aversion to money and conspicuous consumption, Chris\u2019s political leanings could not be described as liberal. Indeed, he delighted in ridiculing the policies of the Democratic Party and was a vocal admirer of Ronald Reagan. At Emory he went so far as to co-found a College Republican Club. Chris\u2019s seemingly anomalous political positions were perhaps best summed up by Thoreau\u2019s declaration in \u201cCivil Disobedience\u201d: \u201cI heartily accept the motto\u2014\u2019That government is best which governs least.\u2019 \u201c&quot;<\/span><br><br>__________","filename":"mccandless7","ext":".jpg","w":236,"h":193,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":102,"tim":1492803463316,"time":1492803463,"md5":"WIDutwye6UeBo1g\/miQnMw==","fsize":11439,"resto":122167113,"id":"RSvIJsNE","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122174860,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)15:38:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122167113\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122167113<\/a><br>Making pol posts great again thanks op.","time":1492803511,"resto":122167113,"id":"6PZjYO9W","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122174880,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)15:38:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"Into the Wild was bretty gud.

[...] McCandless conveniently overlooked the fact that London himself had spent just a single winter in the North and that he\u2019d died by his own hand on his California estate at the age of forty, a fatuous drunk, obese and pathetic, maintaining a sedentary existence that bore scant resemblance to the ideals he espoused in print.&quot;<\/span><br><br>__________<br><br><br>On McCandless&#039;s farewell to his father<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;\u201cWalt\u2019s birthday was June 10, just a few days away, and at the party Chris gave his father a present: a very expensive Questar telescope.

He was almost crying, fighting back the tears, telling Dad that even though they\u2019d had their differences over the years, he was grateful for all the things Dad had done for him. Chris said how much he respected Dad for starting from nothing, working his way through college, busting his ass to support eight kids. It was a moving speech. Everybody there was all choked up.

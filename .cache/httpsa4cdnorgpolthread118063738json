There are several reasons for this, revealing dynamics observable not only in the wider eastern European region, but further west as well.<br><br>While PiS is strongly rightwing on social issues, its economic approach can be described as leftist. It emphasises the need to tackle inequality and propagates strong welfare policies. It introduced unconditional monthly cash payments equivalent to \u00a3100 for all parents who have more than one child towards the upkeep of each subsequent child until he or she is 18. So if you have three children, you get \u00a3200 per month and so forth. For parents with one child, the payment is conditional on low income.<br><br>No previous government ever embarked on such a generous social programme. PiS\u2019s approach puts many Polish leftists in a bind. On the one hand, they deplore the party\u2019s unashamedly xenophobic rhetoric; on the other, they like its economic views, especially in comparison to the main opposition parties, Civic Platform and Nowoczesna, both dominated by folk still enamoured with Hayek. In effect, some on Poland\u2019s left are not as mobilised against PiS as they could be.<br><br>----------------<br><br>Eastern Europeans have actual national socialists in charge.

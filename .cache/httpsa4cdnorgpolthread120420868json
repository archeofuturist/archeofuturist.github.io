I suspect it&#039;s a psychological evolutionary system which makes us appreciate our leaders, and the same part of us that has a need for a deity. It opens us, however, to massive exploitation. Election cycles are pageant shows, popularity contests which usually consist of who can make the biggest and most controversial splash. Switzerland has a ruling council that shares power and is continuously rotated.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The Federal Council is the seven-member executive council which constitutes the federal government of the Swiss Confederation and serves as the collective executive head of government and state of Switzerland.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;While the entire council is responsible for leading the federal administration of Switzerland, each Councillor heads one of the seven federal executive departments. The position of Federal President rotates among the seven Councillors on a yearly basis, with the year&#039;s Vice President becoming next year&#039;s President.<\/span><br><br>This ensures there is no cult of personality as there is no one central figure to adulate or &quot;worship&quot;. It also reduces corruption as power is much less centralized. Leads to more efficiency since each Councillor heads a branch of the federal executive departments, ensuring no one person has the reigns of them all. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Cantons with own governments, own referendums <\/span><br><br>Decentralized power is the solution to the absurd pooling of too much political capital into one place.

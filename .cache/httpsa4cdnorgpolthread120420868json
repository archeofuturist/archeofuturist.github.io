We all know that politicians are easily corruptible, as are all humans. You vote for them on the hope that they deliver their campaign promises, which quickly disappear once they get into office, because of (((special interests))). At best we get a watered down version of that long ago promise they made as a soundbite. <br><br>The only caveat would be &quot;tyranny of the majority&quot; but in Switzerland it hasn&#039;t happened yet:<br><br>https:\/\/archive.is\/ZCbXh<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Switzerland: Proving the Founding Fathers Wrong Since 1848<\/span><br><br>My main point is that the people decide, not a handful of politicians.

I suspect it&#039;s a psychological evolutionary system which makes us appreciate our leaders, and the same part of us that has a need for a deity. It opens us, however, to massive exploitation. Election cycles are pageant shows, popularity contests which usually consist of who can make the biggest and most controversial splash. Switzerland has a ruling council that shares power and is continuously rotated.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The Federal Council is the seven-member executive council which constitutes the federal government of the Swiss Confederation and serves as the collective executive head of government and state of Switzerland.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;While the entire council is responsible for leading the federal administration of Switzerland, each Councillor heads one of the seven federal executive departments. The position of Federal President rotates among the seven Councillors on a yearly basis, with the year&#039;s Vice President becoming next year&#039;s President.<\/span><br><br>This ensures there is no cult of personality as there is no one central figure to adulate or &quot;worship&quot;. It also reduces corruption as power is much less centralized. Leads to more efficiency since each Councillor heads a branch of the federal executive departments, ensuring no one person has the reigns of them all. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Cantons with own governments, own referendums <\/span><br><br>Decentralized power is the solution to the absurd pooling of too much political capital into one place. Each canton has its own constitution, legislature, government and courts.The Swiss Federal Constitution declares the cantons to be sovereign to the extent that their sovereignty is not limited by federal law. The cantons also retain all powers and competencies not delegated to the Confederation by the Constitution.","time":1491818693,"resto":120420868,"id":"jN1s7jB\/","country":"RO","country_name":"Romania"},{"no":120420959,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)06:05:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120420868\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120420868<\/a><br>. Most significantly, the cantons are responsible for healthcare, welfare, law enforcement and public education; they also retain the power of taxation. Each canton can hold their own referendums on their own specific issues. <br><br>As I said at the beginning, these three key features of the Swiss political system make for the purest form of democracy, the lowest level of corruption, the highest level of individual liberty and responsibility for the citizen who truly rules his country instead of handing the reigns to a politician.","time":1491818729,"resto":120420868,"id":"jN1s7jB\/","country":"RO","country_name":"Romania"},{"no":120421197,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)06:08:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120420868\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120420868<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;putting this much power on a horde of mongs<\/span>","filename":"1491728720635","ext":".gif","w":525,"h":525,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491818900634,"time":1491818900,"md5":"cY6+q3eW3GbYYNubclwsnQ==","fsize":1370239,"resto":120420868,"id":"bYBuFBaM","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":120421451,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)06:12:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120421197\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120421197<\/a><br>The average IQ of whites is 100, more than enough to sustain a democracy - as you already see since the western world is already democratic.

There is consciousness everywhere. There are beings all around us that are invisible. We are invisible to them. Like humans some are good some are malevolent and some are a mix. We can&#039;t interact with or sense them physically but we can psychically under certain conditions. Most of these beings are not even complete individuals, they are like psychic parasites and they cannot exist separate from us. Insanity, dreams, shamanic rituals and hallucinogens essentially open the doorway between our worlds. Sometimes these beings help or hurt people. Every culture has a tradition regarding how to interact with and (if need be) control them. These range from good things like exorcism to diabolical witchcraft.<br><br>I would recommend reading Transcendental Magic by Eliphas Levi, the Three Books by Agrippa, and The Secret Teachings of All Ages by Manly P.

Aleister Crowley is also interesting.","filename":"1491580818897","ext":".jpg","w":725,"h":945,"tn_w":95,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492651656118,"time":1492651656,"md5":"w72XdS7wqeTcGk42dpKn5g==","fsize":213065,"resto":121926548,"id":"bNXVWVEf","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]}

Most of these beings are not even complete individuals, they are like psychic parasites and they cannot exist separate from us. Insanity, dreams, shamanic rituals and hallucinogens essentially open the doorway between our worlds. Sometimes these beings help or hurt people.

If you think it&#039;s fake, you are in fact retarded.<br><br>It&#039;s all about dopamine imbalance in the mesolimbic and mesocortical system of the brain. Mesolimbic manifests as positive symptoms i.e. psychosis resulting in hallucination and delusions (dopamine is hitting your emotion circuits too hard). While the negative symptoms manifest from too little dopamine stimulation of the cortex resulting in the 5 A&#039;s (anhedonia, alogia, asociality, affective blunting, and avolition). Lastly you have concentration deficits resulting in a pruning of cholinergic innervation of the brain. <br><br>Our atypical antipsychotics work very well with these systems with little side effects (or at least they&#039;re better than having SZ). The most sophisticated drug we use nowadays is aripiprazole (abilify). It&#039;s a Dopamine 2 partial agonist while also being a serotonin 5HT2 antagonist.<br><br>You don&#039;t hallucinate good things because simply it&#039;s like being crazy but also having depression. You can be bipolar (mix of manic euphoria episodes followed by major depression) but SZ is a whole other thing. SZ does show many of the same symptoms as major depression in the fact that there is lack of cortical stimulation by catecholamines, but with there is added stimulation to the mesolimbic system which depression doesn&#039;t have. <br><br>It&#039;s like always being in a bad trip.","time":1492659541,"resto":121926548,"id":"M4JkQjhl","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121946821,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)23:41:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121932557\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121932557<\/a><br>Autism in itself is a special thing.

There are so many differences in the brains of schizophrenics (between each other and normal brains), that really there is no one biological cause other than copping out and saying they have abnormal biology.

You can always reframe a situation to make it seem better, but you start remixing it too many times, you go full retard and the images take control again. Using different rules, most &quot;philosophical&quot; schizophrenia occurs when someone tries to alter their perception of reality to give them back control, but things still don&#039;t turn out the way they want.

You mock us on your plebbit threads, mocking the red-pill, thinking that toppling the essence of \/pol\/ will be something to aspire to. I would very much like to extend an open armed invitation for you to try.<br><br>Let me explain something that you don&#039;t seem to understand. The &#039;red pill&#039; isn&#039;t a switch. It&#039;s not a single event. It&#039;s not anything like that at all. It is a mind virus, one that you&#039;ve been sheltering yourself from in your echo chambers from. The red pill is the true nature of the world around you, unburdened by emotion, free of feeling, and concentrated in fact. Facts that are depressing. Facts that are infuriating.<br><br>I welcome you because this is not an echo chamber. There are people from around the world, every ethnicity, men and women, from the guy who cooks the fries to fucking Taylor Swift. Doctors, lawyers, teachers, we are all here. Some of us were just like you...<br><br>Oh I know your attitude. You think your reasoning is sound. You&#039;ve sandbagged and barricaded your position well. You think we will throw bullets, but we won&#039;t. All you will hear is the tide. In and out the tide will go, eroding away your precious logic, little wave after little wave eating away the layers upon layers of fallacy and illogical reasoning you have subjected yourself to over the years.<br><br>Soon you will find that things that used to make sense do not make sense any more. That blaming x for y tingles your head with doubt. That labeling x as y doesn&#039;t seem as honest. The knowledge is bitter. Sometimes it&#039;s painful. At this point it&#039;s already much too late.<br><br>You see, I know this will happen, because it happened to me. So many others as well are here for that reason. By simply typing in the web address and seeing that \/pol\/ at the top of your browser...<br><br>It has already begun. You don&#039;t even know it yet. <br><br>You are already one of us.<br><br>Welcome. <br><br>Faggot.","filename":"1492808279904","ext":".gif","w":500,"h":208,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":104,"tim":1492809873266,"time":1492809873,"md5":"49CbtiJFxWaqt9YqEM9KvQ==","fsize":2060570,"resto":0,"id":"YDJRYUDj","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"to-antifa-with-love","country_name":"United States","replies":3,"images":0,"unique_ips":4},{"no":122188172,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)17:28:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"WTF I love antifa now","time":1492810111,"resto":122187682,"id":"jul\/8Kqm","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122189658,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)17:40:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"Cringepost","time":1492810821,"resto":122187682,"id":"IU\/5VKOV","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":122190044,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)17:43:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122187682\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122187682<\/a><br><br><a href=\"#p122189658\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122189658<\/a><br><br>i mean it&#039;s slightly less autistic than the most autistic it could&#039;ve been written","time":1492811012,"resto":122187682,"id":"TtZUKZaX","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

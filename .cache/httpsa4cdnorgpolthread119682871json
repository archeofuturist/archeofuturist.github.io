Its textbook perfection of how lies and misdeeds or often achieved by those with a bigger agenda. What am I talking about? The &quot;rebels&quot;. <br><br> The Syrian Rebels have a completely different agenda, they are paid soldiers technically speaking and I&#039;ve kept track of who supports and supplies them and how they operate. It&#039;s rather logical to say that these rebel groups are in fact compromised if they were once rebel groups at all, compromised by the same operatives that run ISIS. What if that bomb dropped by the SAA was in fact for a weapons cache held by the rebels? Similar &quot;chemical&quot; attacks have happened before with no warhead found so I beg to question the validity that the SAA is that fucking stupid to actually drop a chemical war head. If so then I highly doubt Russia is as stupid as to continue support. So who&#039;s agenda does this fit? <br><br> Lets look back and start investigating because this is very much the same players as it was with the Obama administration. You had the Obama Administration take out Bin Laden, now all of a sudden troops withdraw and BOOM here comes ISIS. Here come rebels with no loyalties and changing factions (to highest bidder from the looks of things). If we can expose the truth we can expose it to Trump. He will listen to us just like he has listened to us before and we know he HAS. It&#039;s up to us what we do with this. We can start an investigation and dig out the truth.. I know if we put out tard heads together, we; the degenerate deplorables CAN figure out the truth and restore order in the office. I can&#039;t do this alone guys... what say all of you?","filename":"1478691661655","ext":".jpg","w":1080,"h":1920,"tn_w":140,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491440301364,"time":1491440301,"md5":"HHMtUHAuDjRZO4PWkRd59g==","fsize":282895,"resto":0,"id":"\/JdlFUFJ","country":"CA","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"im-not-going-to-join-the-tin-foil-hat-party-and","country_name":"Canada","replies":1,"images":1,"unique_ips":2},{"no":119684374,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)21:12:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"Blumpf","filename":"IMG_0076","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":321,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":66,"tim":1491441155421,"time":1491441155,"md5":"074mBbtmtQBW6CuukXc8pw==","fsize":43913,"resto":119682871,"id":"+ruGUp90","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

That was huge news, it was a serious deal, and yet, what did America do?<br><br>Not a goddamn thing.<br><br>The entire story went cold faster than a middle-aged hooker out in December. All that we really did was give Russia the justification to strengthen their forces in Syria, and did literally no damage to the airport that we poked.<br><br>I bet Trump shit himself when the IC told him about Russia knowing, though. He probably threw a tantrum at Tillerson and they decided to just bury the news instead of responding any further.<br><br>Which is what happened. Their attempt to distract from the Russian collusion story failed and was actually strengthened by the entire debacle.","filename":"gallery-1490726176-gettyimages-97318579","ext":".jpg","w":1600,"h":2408,"tn_w":166,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493584771074,"time":1493584771,"md5":"gO99b4k2TX88oAf93baU3w==","fsize":340333,"resto":0,"id":"byowrcUJ","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"trump-underestimated-our-intelligence-capability","country_name":"United States","replies":3,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":123523615,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)16:42:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123523242\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123523242<\/a><br><br>I&#039;m sorry, but what do you even want?

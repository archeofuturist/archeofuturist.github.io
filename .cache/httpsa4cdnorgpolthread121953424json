That&#039;s part of why you do better with a math major: you&#039;ve been directly practicing the exact skills that you need to succeed in law school. During the second\/third year of a math major the classes change. It&#039;s no longer crunching numbers like you did in calculus. You begin to work on proving concepts using definitions and many common logical forms (induction, proof by contradiction, proof by contrapositive, etc.). For instance, algebra in college is not about solving linear equations or parabolas, it&#039;s about group\/ring\/other algebraic structures theory. You&#039;re also missing the fact that majoring in mathematics sets you apart from all the poly sci kids. You are different and have a unique persepective: something that admissions offices love to see. Finally, math is a hard major. Poly sci, history, sociology are all relatively easy majors from the perspective of an admissions officer (and also quite possibly objectively). <br><br>I&#039;m not a shoo-in because I majored in math, I&#039;m a shoo-in because I destroyed the LSAT. Math is just something that further helps me like my research, recommendations, and college extracurricular activities (and even my eagle scout).","time":1492669559,"resto":121953424,"id":"vB68PJYI","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121963032,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)02:26:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121962935\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121962935<\/a><br><br>Also phil major<br><br>I don&#039;t think beliefs can represent IQ -- well they actually just can&#039;t<br><br>IQ literally makes smart people better at believing in bullshit<br><br>so they&#039;re just smart retards","time":1492669561,"resto":121953424,"id":"FrhKI12X","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121963300,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)02:29:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121959951\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121959951<\/a><br>ma arki kartaa mid ka mid ciddiyihii orsada, in ka dhigaysa shan iyo toban<br><br>shiiieeeeet","time":1492669750,"resto":121953424,"id":"RZC1S16F","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121963482,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)02:31:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121963032\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121963032<\/a><br>Hey fellow phil bro.<br><br>It&#039;s not just what they believe, but primarily what they don&#039;t know.

Arriving at a hole in the ground they started digging until it was about four feet deep. One of the men turned to Benson and asked, &quot;What do you think this is for?&quot; She shrugged, and the man replied, &quot;This is a fresh hole for decomposed bodies&quot;. They pushed her in, two of the men attacking her with a cutlass, badly wounding Benson in the chest and throat.[1] She was buried alive, some of the men jumping on the soil to keep her down until she succumbed. The autopsy later found inhaled dirt in her lungs. It was alleged that Michael X had ordered her death because she was causing &quot;mental strain&quot; to Jamal.[2]<\/span>","filename":"bensonDM1502_468x807","ext":".jpg","w":468,"h":807,"tn_w":72,"tn_h":124,"tim":1492426084156,"time":1492426084,"md5":"EE0OGVLp05fufxLI8neHXg==","fsize":53225,"resto":121511477,"id":"+SAQIMHy","country":"BG","country_name":"Bulgaria"},{"no":121511930,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)06:51:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121511477\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121511477<\/a><br>MKultra succeded, there is no explanation for this<br>Funny thing her dad called her daughter human life like it was a stranger for him.","time":1492426261,"resto":121511477,"id":"S1cY8KT\/","country":"BO","country_name":"Bolivia"}]}

Knew it would come in handy:<br><br>Short version: it&#039;s a scam.<br><br>Long version:<br>Art has become a tax evasion loophole for the ultra-rich. Instead of having a million dollar, you just get some shitty modern art piece that you will sell to someone else when you need liquidity. Maybe eventually it&#039;ll stop, but by then, it may well have been bought by some public institution, museum or whatever else, hence bankrolling tax evasion in the name of &quot;art&quot;.<br>That&#039;s the economic reason for modern art. The cultural reason is simply pedantry. &quot;Artists&quot; hate more than anything else being similar to the hoi polloi, so they find more and more ways to make sure the average man cannot comprehend their art, despite the average man being more and more educated. To accomplish this, they simply removed the whole &quot;pursuit of beauty&quot; from art and replaced it with pseudo-symbolic bullshit that really dont need to make a sense, just need to seems intricate to the outside eye. And intricate it is, since you&#039;d try to find meaning where there is just the equivalent of smashing your head against your keyboard.<br><br>Some more stuff:<br>Once you remove any sort of meaning and standart from art, you&#039;re left with art pieces you cant rate other than &#039;i like\/dont like it&quot;, and cant formulate much reasons for it.

I still have honey, though.<br>It&#039;s not an easy diet until you get used to it. I don&#039;t eat any of that fake meat soya shit.<br>Soya is very bad. <br>Example: today for breakfast I had 2 slices of toast with marmite, 3 cups of mint tea and a banana. I usually have porridge with dried fruit.<br>lunch: fried potatoes in olive oil and a mix of beans done in a spicy tomato sauce with onions, grated carrot, garlic.<br>For tea, I&#039;m making stuffed red peppers. The filling is chopped mushrooms, breadcrumbs, tahini paste, more garlic, spices etc. For after, a pear poached in a red wine and brown sugar syrup. <br><br>It&#039;s a very healthy diet. For snacks - nuts, crisps, dark chocolate, dried fruit.<br>I drink shitloads of tea - Yorkshire tea also mint tea. With honey or brown sugar. <br>Planning ahead is the key. And being creative. <br>My wife eats meat and I don&#039;t mind cooking it. She&#039;s a shit cook. <br>And she fucks up the kitchen - the kids eat what I eat and I&#039;ll give them dairy; yogurt, ice cream, cheese. I grated some cheese on what I had for lunch added chopped ham. That&#039;s what they had for tea. They loved it and wanted more.<br>I always have some soup going. There&#039;s always some on the hob. Today it&#039;s leek and potato.<br>I&#039;m a baker by profession, so I have to get up very early. There&#039;s always fresh bread in our home.

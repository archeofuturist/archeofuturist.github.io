Lot of women like what you&#039;re describing. That&#039;s what happens to them if they don&#039;t get married. They usually end up single moms working in factories wondering and they think they&#039;re hot shit with trashy tattoos and overly done makeup, despite being in their 40&#039;s. They try to lure the male factory workers.","time":1492100009,"resto":120925375,"id":"gIHVRgnr","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120926692,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)12:16:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120926371\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120926371<\/a><br>this sums it up pretty well but to be fair, there will always be a ton of beta providers out there.

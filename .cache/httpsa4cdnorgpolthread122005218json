This can end up costing $100,000 per year for rehab.

Honestly. You&#039;ve got no fucking idea boy. To you it&#039;s a concept. An idea. An imagined interpretation. To many people out there. It&#039;s our ever present, constant, unending reality.

I think chronic pain has to be one of the hardest things to manage and really besides palliative and mindfulness approaches, addressing the underlying causes of pain are really the only answer. But if you have a chronic disease that doesn&#039;t go away even after they&#039;ve tried all medications, they will eventually move you over to methadone to make themselves feel better about prescibing high doses. I guess what I am saying is there are quite a few people I know who get under served drastically when it comes to pain management.

Most of the time, I&#039;ve found, it&#039;s basically a weird security blanket for poor dumb people. Being capable of budgeting drug use while maintaining a residence or somewhat stable life feels like an accomplishment to them in a life otherwise devoid of accomplishments.<br><br>I&#039;m a commercial weed producer, I could have any substance I want whenever I want it and have plenty of money to afford any number of addictions, but I don&#039;t even look at my own product. I have no compulsion at all to take any drugs or drink alcohol, even though they&#039;re essentially free for me. I&#039;m also busy, 24\/7, essentially running my whole enterprise by myself and being even slightly impaired at any time is incredibly stressful given my liabilities.<br><br>The addiction epidemic, I feel, is coming from society nurturing pathological behaviors and bottomless apathy. There&#039;s nothing to accomplish in the developed world anymore, or at least it feels like that to a lot of people. The Freudian &quot;death instinct&quot; has taken hold, where &quot;defying the odds&quot; by not aspirating vomit on any given day is the last holdout of rugged individualism. I&#039;m surrounded by drug addicts every day, almost everyone I associate with professionally is an addict, and the reasons why people take drugs are infinitely more nuanced than &quot;I can&#039;t stop taking drugs and I like getting completely bombed all the time&quot;. I don&#039;t see opiates or addiction rates dropping without a cataclysmic event occurring that makes life difficult where accomplishing something would be rewarded proportionately (I.E. going to college for 12 years to be an MD means your car is slightly faster than the pizza man&#039;s).","time":1492727466,"resto":122005218,"id":"QSGeWNAQ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122055406,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)18:32:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122054039\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122054039<\/a><br>Oh look, another leftist commie leaf","time":1492727522,"resto":122005218,"id":"pE8wlmkn","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122055464,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)18:32:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122046522\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122046522<\/a><br>This mindset is exactly why I hate my job some days.","time":1492727541,"resto":122005218,"id":"06SCqy8S","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122056136,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)18:37:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"prohibitionist laws and poor drug education have led us to this point.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;mfw the damed pharma complex keeps cannabis off the scene while allowing opioids to ruin a generation.<\/span><br>DAILY REMINDER<br>Marijuana&#039;s CBDs are far more effective at<br>PAIN<br>NAUSEA <br>CANCER<br>YOU WON&#039;T BELIEVE WHAT THE GOVERNMENT&#039;S PATENT IS FOR.<br><br>THE US GOVERNMENT HAS HELD A MEDICAL MARIJUANA PATENT SINCE 1999<br>It&#039;s for the &quot;neuroregenerative and neuroprotective&quot; properties.<br>Patent #6630507","filename":"patent6630507","ext":".png","w":1005,"h":692,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":86,"tim":1492727839918,"time":1492727839,"md5":"e09EY5oIV4gcH2kqYvfdew==","fsize":56678,"resto":122005218,"id":"nW\/DCVyR","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122056186,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)18:37:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122054146\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122054146<\/a><br>You sacrifice control over regulation yourself and end up with fentanyl in the street heroin that creates this problem anyway to a much greater extent.

I don&#039;t think there are any easy answers, but my frustration was less inpatient and more outpatient. I have a friend who was on over 400mL of diladuid IV per day which is apparently over the LD50 for his weight. No doctor at UCSF wanted to take him as a patient mostly because of having to write for the high doses. This was back in 2004 or so, he is now on like 100mg of Oxy over the course of 24 hours, it&#039;s kind of a miracle. So many doctors said he would not survive his hemoglobin was around 6 and his albumin was so low his muscles were all saturated with water. Basically he was at death&#039;s door. He is much better overall now, but none of the crohns meds work for him so they have him on IVIG which not only costs over 1 million per year (it&#039;s a fairly high dose when used for autoimmune disorders) but has all sorts of side effects including aseptic meningitis. Long story short Crohn&#039;s costs the USA probably 40-60 billion a year and most of it comes from those who are very very sick. Oh and my friend who was on the basically lethal doses of hydromorphone? Would the doctors at UCSF accept him as a patient in 2017? I mean they have to, but would they just let him die to avoid having to report that increase in their DEA license reporting.","time":1492729027,"resto":122005218,"id":"ZLI9Huu+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122058982,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)18:59:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122018682\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122018682<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;This is a severe health crisis, and death rates are doubling and tripling in some places.<\/span><br><br>The reason is not because there are &quot;more addicts&quot; persay... the reason is because the current &quot;trend&quot; among mafia\/trafficking orgs on the Gang\/Street level is because, they are cutting their already shitty, cut Heroin with Fentanyl and shitty Chinese RCs (Research Chemicals) like Apomorphone and a billion Fentanyl analogs.

A major part of the problem is that opioids are extremely over-prescribed. Doctors hand out scripts for the things like candy to people who simply don&#039;t need them. It&#039;s become easy\/lazy to just throw painkillers at patients who complain to you. At any rate, we give them opioids, and they eventually get addicted. This puts them along the slippery slope where they start needing to get more. They eventually have to turn to the street for their oxycodone and hydromorphone. But prescription drugs are expensive on the street. Heroin is dirt cheap. The majority of of opioid addicts follow this path of originally using them for a valid purpose and getting hooked. <br><br>The other problem is more intangible and metaphysical. It&#039;s not just about the drugs themselves. The other MAJOR problem is that our people - white people - are experiencing what I call a &quot;spiritual death&quot;. And that doesn&#039;t even need to be taken in a religious way. It&#039;s like the will of our people to thrive has ended. Like our spark has been extinguished. And there are plenty of reasons behind this. The dismantlement of religion, the destruction of the family unit, the demographic replacement\/displacement of white people, poor economic situation, rampant degeneracy, etc. All these things sum up to the problem we currently have.

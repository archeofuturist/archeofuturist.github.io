Maybe I am sheltered. Worse than the opiate epidemic is actually the chronic pain epidemic. I can think of a few people I know who are on long term opiate pain medication, and it&#039;s gotten so much more ridiculous the past few years. Do you want to know the real cause of some of this opiate hype? I am not including street heroin, I am talking just about doctors in the US and their prescription rights. It is because if they have a patient go to rehab after a Vicodin or Valium prescription, they are on the book financially for the rehab, sometimes multiple visits. This can end up costing $100,000 per year for rehab.

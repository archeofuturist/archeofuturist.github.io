This can end up costing $100,000 per year for rehab.

Honestly. You&#039;ve got no fucking idea boy. To you it&#039;s a concept. An idea. An imagined interpretation. To many people out there. It&#039;s our ever present, constant, unending reality.

I think chronic pain has to be one of the hardest things to manage and really besides palliative and mindfulness approaches, addressing the underlying causes of pain are really the only answer. But if you have a chronic disease that doesn&#039;t go away even after they&#039;ve tried all medications, they will eventually move you over to methadone to make themselves feel better about prescibing high doses. I guess what I am saying is there are quite a few people I know who get under served drastically when it comes to pain management. It wasn&#039;t always like this, like 8 years ago was when doctors started getting lectured more regularly about addiction and that they were liable.<br><br>What do you think about all the real patients who go with pain med needs unmet? And those of us who aren&#039;t high risk won&#039;t buy anything off the street. I&#039;ve known so many people who killed themselves from chronic pain, specifically Crohn&#039;s.

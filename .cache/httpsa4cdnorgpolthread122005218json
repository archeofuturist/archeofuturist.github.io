This can end up costing $100,000 per year for rehab.

Once I did start on Opioids and very strong anti - inflammatory drugs I showed immediate signs of pain reduction\/ improvement in activity. The doctors seemed to take on a &quot;any improvement is a win&quot; type of attitude and wrote me prescriptions like blank cheques. <br><br>Eventually through counseling and will - power I&#039;ve learnt to simply tune out the majority of the pain. When you&#039;re in pain 24\/7, you do just get used to it. I honestly have no choice but to just deal with it and get on with it. <br><br>If you&#039;ve never experienced chronic, every second of every day, can&#039;t sleep uninterrupted for more than a couple of hours in row, at times teeth - clenching, wanting to scream out, involuntary grunts and sharp exhalations of breath from simple movements, constant fucking pain... coupled with intermittent chronic fatigue and your entire former life (career, relationships and finances) deteriorating rapidly around you...<br>Well. Honestly. You&#039;ve got no fucking idea boy. To you it&#039;s a concept. An idea. An imagined interpretation. To many people out there. It&#039;s our ever present, constant, unending reality. You want an idea of what I feel like all the time? Run 5 miles, do a days work of heavy labor and then have someone hit you in the knees, hands, feet and lower back with a brick.","time":1492708322,"resto":122005218,"id":"XX7WBdtk","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":122015403,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)13:12:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"http:\/\/www.breitbart.com\/big-govern<wbr>ment\/2015\/10\/03\/doj-mexican-cartel-<wbr>used-middle-eastern-honor-system-la<wbr>under-u-s-currency\/<br><br>http:\/\/www.newsweek.com\/how-halt-af<wbr>ghan-drug-trade-follow-money-315631<wbr><br><br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/CIA_t<wbr>ransnational_anti-crime_and_anti-dr<wbr>ug_activities#The_nexus_between_the<wbr>_drug_industry_and_hawala<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Informal money transfer systems to support clandestine activity, including terrorism, drug trade, and intelligence collection<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The intelligence community and the United States Department of the Treasury attempt to control hawala used to finance terrorism.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;There are claims and counterclaims that the US may have used groups involved in drug smuggling in an effort to destabilize Iran. <\/span><br><br>It would be a shame if someone took advantage of this situation for off-the-record funding of illegal activities.

The troubling reality being referred to is the widespread practice of Muslim inbreeding and the birth defects and social ills that it spawns.<br><br>The tragic effect of the left\u2019s control of the boundaries of debate is that any discussion about vital issues such as these marks an individual as an \u201cIslamophobe\u201d and a \u201cracist.\u201d A person who dares to point at the pathology of inbreeding in the Muslim community is accused of whipping up hatred against Muslim people. But all of this could not be further from the truth. To fight against inbreeding anywhere is to defend humanity and to defend innocent babies from birth defects. Fighting against this Islamic practice stems from a pro-Muslim calling, since identifying destructive ideologies and practices in Islam enables the protection of the Muslim people from harm.<br><br>Massive inbreeding among Muslims has been going on since their prophet allowed first-cousin marriages more than 50 generations (1,400 years) ago. For many Muslims, therefore, intermarriage is regarded as being part of their religion. In many Muslim communities, it is a source of social status to marry one&#039;s daughter or son to his or her cousin. Intermarriage also ensures that wealth is kept within the family. Islam\u2019s strict authoritarianism plays a large role as well: keeping daughters and sons close gives families more power to control and decide their choices and lifestyles.","time":1491815553,"resto":120415752,"id":"ezL4d+ko","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120417087,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)05:13:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"Westerners have a historical tradition of being ready to fight and die for their country. Muslims, on the other hand, are bound together less by patriotism, but mainly by family relations and religion. Intermarrying to protect the family and community from outside non-Islamic influence is much more important to Muslims living in a Western nation than integrating into that nation and supporting it.<br><br>Today, 70 percent of all Pakistanis are inbred and in Turkey the amount is between 25-30 percent (Jyllands-Posten, 27\/2 2009 &quot;More stillbirths among immigrants&quot;). A rough estimate reveals that close to half of everybody living in the Arab world is inbred. A large percentage of the parents that are blood related come from families where intermarriage has been a tradition for generations.<br><br>A BBC investigation in Britain several years ago revealed that at least 55% of the Pakistani community in Britain was married to a first cousin. The Times of India affirmed that \u201cthis is thought to be linked to the probability that a British Pakistani family is at least 13 times more likely than the general population to have children with recessive genetic disorders.\u201d","time":1491815609,"resto":120415752,"id":"ezL4d+ko","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120417120,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)05:13:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"The BBC\u2019s research also discovered that while British Pakistanis accounted for just 3.4% of all births in Britain, they accounted for 30% of all British children with recessive disorders and a higher rate of infant mortality. It is not a surprise, therefore, that, in response to this evidence, a Labour Party MP has called for a ban on first-cousin marriage.<br><br>Medical evidence shows that one of the negative consequences of inbreeding is a 100 percent increase in the risk of stillbirths. One study comparing Norwegians and Pakistanis shows the risk that the child dies during labor increases by 50 percent. The risk of death due to autosomal recessive disorders -- e.g., cystic fibrosis and spinal muscular atrophy -- is 18 times higher. Risk of death due to malformations is 10 times higher. Mental health is also at risk: the probability of depression is higher in communities where consanguine marriages are also high. The closer the blood relative, the higher the risk of mental and physical retardation and schizophrenic illness.<br><br>And then there are the findings on intelligence. Research shows that if one\u2019s parents are cousins, intelligence goes down 10-16 IQ points. The risk of having an IQ lower than 70 (criterion for being &quot;retarded&quot;) increases 400 percent among children from cousin marriages. An academic paper published in the Indian National Science Academy found that \u201cthe onset of various social profiles like visual fixation, social smile, sound seizures, oral expression and hand-grasping are significantly delayed among the new-born inbred babies.&quot; Another study found that Indian Muslim school boys whose parents were first cousins tested significantly lower than boys whose parents were unrelated in a non-verbal test on intelligence.","time":1491815632,"resto":120415752,"id":"ezL4d+ko","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120417168,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)05:14:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"It is estimated that one third of all handicapped people in Copenhagen have a foreign background.

Expenses related to mentally and physically handicapped Muslim immigrants, for instance, severely drain the budgets and resources of our societies. Look at Denmark, for example: one third of the budget for the country\u2019s schools is spent on children with special needs. Muslim children are grossly overrepresented among these children. More than half of all children in schools for children with mental and physical handicaps in Copenhagen are foreigners -- of whom Muslims are by far the largest group.

It also offers non-Western immigrants up to 15 thousand euros or 20 thousand dollars to emigrate back to their countries of origin. Immigrants who are not Danish citizens are banished from Denmark if they commit violent crimes. The state does not support families economically for having more than the country&#039;s average amount of children. This prevents foreigners from coming to Denmark who have plans to have a lot of children and live off the state&#039;s child support system.

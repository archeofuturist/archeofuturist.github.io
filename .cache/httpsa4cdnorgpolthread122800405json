It&#039;s trying to stick it&#039;s claws into the country and maintain the status quo, which relies on an influx of unskilled foreign labour. Theese neo-liberal policies are the ones driving the influx of immigration. It was when blair fully embraced neoliberalism that the great influx of immigrants took place. The centre has been shifted so outside of the peoples interest that you&#039;ve lost sight of what normal is. I don&#039;t value diversity. I&#039;m not particularly anti-immigrant but what I am is anti flooding the country with an army of culturally alien third world workers who are solely there to increase profits and destroy any labour movement that might have once existed. It isn&#039;t socialism or civic nationalism that is doing this. It&#039;s neo-liberal capitalism. Neo liberal capitalism wnats a global consumersit culture without borders and without distinctions so that it can profit to the extreme. Just look at Japan. It was capitalists in the guise of commodore mathew perry and the american navy who forced it to open up so that they could profit. In the same way these capitalists have forced britain open.

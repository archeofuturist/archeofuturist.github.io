There&#039;s no immediate future for me here, it took 100 bolivares or so to buy a dollar in 2013, now it&#039;s almost at 5000. So yeah, Zimbabwe, eat your heat out. Take into account minimum monthly wage was just raised to 200000 bolivares, 130000 of these being food benefits, while a month&#039;s groceries for a family of 4 will set you back nearly 700000 bolivares.

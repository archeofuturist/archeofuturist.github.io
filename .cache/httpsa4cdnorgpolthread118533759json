The problem is that they had to bow to Aldmeri Dominion&#039;s demands, which in turn lead to some decisions that understandably pissed off Stormcloaks in the first place.

And say what you will, Empire may be globalist cucks but it&#039;s still better them as they consider Skyrim their equal, even if less sophisticated memberstate over arrogant, megalomaniacs that will see locals as untermensch on account of them being humans, ready to go ballistic when those humans dare to worship an ascended human on par with the rest of their

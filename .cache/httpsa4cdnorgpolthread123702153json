In not being permitted to freely exclude, the incidence of bads-ill-behaved, lazy, unreliable, rotten students, employees, customers-will increase and property values will fall. In fact, forced integration (the result of all nondiscrimination policies) breeds ill behavior and bad character. In civilized society, the ultimate price for ill behavior is expulsion, and all-around ill-behaved or rotten characters (even if they commit no criminal offense) will find themselves quickly expelled from everywhere and by everyone and become outcasts, physically removed from civilization. This is a stiff price to paYi hence, the frequency of such behavior is reduced. By contrast, if one is prevented from expelling others from one&#039;s property whenever their presence is deemed undesirable, ill behavior, misconduct, and outright rotten characters are encouraged (rendered less costly).<br><br> Rather than being isolated and ultimately entirely removed from society, the &quot;bums&quot; -in every conceivable area of incompetency (bumhood)-are permitted to perpetrate their unpleasantries everywhere, so bum-like behavior and bums will proliferate. The results of forced integration are only too visible. All social relations-whether in private or business life-have become increasingly egalitarian (everyone is on a first name basis with everyone else) and uncivilized.","time":1493689219,"resto":123702153,"id":"42TvQZlE","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123706678,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)21:40:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"cont:<br><br> In distinct contrast, a society in which the right to exclusion is fully restored to owners of private property would be profoundly unegalitarian, intolerant, and discriminatory.

Instead, one would be on the right path toward restoring the freedom of association and exclusion implied in the institution of private property, if only towns and villages could and would do what they did as a matter of course until well into the nineteenth century in Europe and the United States. There would be signs regarding entrance requirements to the town, and, once in town, requirements for entering specific pieces of property (for example, no beggars, bums, or homeless, but also no homosexuals, drug users, Jews, Moslems, Germans, or Zulus), and those who did not meet these entrance requirements would be kicked out as trespassers.

Likewise, in a covenant founded for the purpose of protecting family and kin, there can be no tolerance toward those habitually promoting lifestyles incompatible with this goal.

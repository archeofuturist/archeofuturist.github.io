To give him plausible deniability when some of his associates are arrested for the Russia scandal? Attacking the airbase of Syria with Russian permission (but killing no one) is a good way to defend yourself to the media later, earlier today one of the members of the investigation said people will be arrested so I actually think it&#039;s plausible that Trump did this both to appear strong but also distance himself from Russia. It&#039;s a solid move, although given his lack of compassion for the Assad regime&#039;s atrocities in the past and the fact that this &quot;attack&quot; contradicts years of Trump&#039;s attitudes towards Syria, I&#039;m skeptical that it&#039;s anything more than a political move to increase popularity and distance himself from Russia.","filename":"IMG_3649","ext":".jpg","w":1242,"h":706,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":142,"tim":1491542643015,"time":1491542643,"md5":"hJOnubQljzmyFCP+e+ho7Q==","fsize":128444,"resto":0,"id":"yW14Hb2r","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"trump-btfo","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

Ten to twelve million German men would be assigned to forced labor under Allied supervision in countries outside of Germany to rebuild their economies. &quot;The objects of this measure,&quot; wrote Dr. Hooton, &quot;include reduction of the birthrate of &#039;pure&#039; Germans, neutralization of German aggressiveness by outbreeding and denationalization of indoctrinated individuals.&quot;<\/span><br><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;This plan, Hooton estimated, would require at least 20 years to be implemented. &quot;During this period,&quot; he went on, &quot;encourage also the immigration and settlement in the German states of non-German nationals, especially males.&quot;<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In the decades since the end of World War II, something of the spirit of the genocidal Kaufman and Hooton plans seems manifest in Germany&#039;s population and immigration policies. Since the nation&#039;s defeat in 1945, the German birth rate has fallen to below the replacement level, millions of racially and culturally alien migrants have been welcomed as settlers in Germany, the number of children of mixed ethnicity has sharply increased, and the ethnic-cultural character of much of the country has been drastically altered, especially in the larger cities.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;This war is being waged by the German People. It is they who are responsible. It is they who must be made to pay for the war. otherwise, there will always be a German war against the world. And with such a sword forever hanging overhead the civilized nations of the world, no matter how great their hopes, how strenuous their efforts, will never succeed in creating that firm and solid foun- dation of permanent peace which they must first establish if ever they intend to start the building of a better world.<\/span>","filename":"kaufman","ext":".jpg","w":296,"h":413,"tn_w":179,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490552260810,"time":1490552260,"md5":"t0fOV3NbQ\/6i9eRfJm9Obg==","fsize":23740,"resto":0,"id":"YuGdMN7x","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"refugee-crisis-just-a-gear-in-the-machine","country_name":"Canada","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":1},{"no":118394592,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)14:28:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"Everyday it seems Hitler was more and more right","time":1490552923,"resto":118393153,"id":"YuGdMN7x","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]}

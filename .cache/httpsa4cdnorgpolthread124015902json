Her voice is loud and whiny, Macron&#039;s voice is calm and collected. <br><br>It&#039;s not about whether you support her ideas or not, but she&#039;s very bad at defending them. Pulling a crushing victory in the debate was her only hope of bridging the 20 points gap she has with Macron. <br>She absolutely won&#039;t be able to rally an extra 10% of French voters in 5 days unless a major terrorist attacks happens that somehow can be blamed on refugees.","filename":"afp-20170503-fr-debate-macron-le-pen","ext":".jpg","w":768,"h":384,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493870841506,"time":1493870841,"md5":"uYeyITcKoo+iGPAFWNaO3w==","fsize":69367,"resto":0,"id":"Q\/6ZcVLt","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"i-just-watched-the-debate-can-speak-french-so-im","country_name":"Canada","replies":38,"images":2,"unique_ips":26},{"no":124016080,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)00:08:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"Votez Le Pen ou je vais vous battre","filename":"AverageFrenchNationalist","ext":".jpg","w":215,"h":234,"tn_w":114,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493870935610,"time":1493870935,"md5":"p47Ywh5ffil\/67rndv0Ybg==","fsize":5421,"resto":124015902,"id":"U5\/F8F3r","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124016229,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)00:10:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124015902\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124015902<\/a><br>Je parie que vous aimez sucrer une grosse bite noire","time":1493871016,"resto":124015902,"id":"w9yS1PkY","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124016387,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)00:11:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"Communist lovers must never be tolerated","time":1493871097,"resto":124015902,"id":"Eu8Ghx02","country":"VI","country_name":"U.S. Virgin Islands"},{"no":124016426,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)00:11:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124015902\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124015902<\/a><br>SONT DANS LES VILLES SONT DANS LES CAMPAGNES<br>*maniacally waves hands around*<br>You&#039;re right.","time":1493871115,"resto":124015902,"id":"FFSZQMGq","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":124016503,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)00:12:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124015902\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124015902<\/a><br>Shilling this hard","time":1493871154,"resto":124015902,"id":"cZlKaptD","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":124016564,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)00:13:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124015902\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124015902<\/a><br>can anyone else confirm this?","time":1493871193,"resto":124015902,"id":"bvwuKjxz","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124016601,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)00:13:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"Trump never had a bad debate.","time":1493871208,"resto":124015902,"id":"gsat2phR","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124016651,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)00:13:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124016601\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124016601<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;my dick is big little marco<\/span>","time":1493871233,"resto":124015902,"id":"FFSZQMGq","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":124016810,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)00:15:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124016080\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124016080<\/a><br>She really isn&#039;t a good choice.

I&#039;ve been there, I ended up taking antidepressants. They helped a lot but unless it&#039;s something clinical rather than situational, I&#039;d avoid them. You need to be disciplined, strict about your day to day life. Create attainable goals and etch them in stone, once you have the rhythm down for these smaller tasks you escalate. Keep a far future in mind, what values do you want to adhere to, what life do you want in 5 or 10 years? Mull it over, even if it takes days. Find out what man, or woman, you want to be. When I say etch these things in stone I absolutely mean it; write it down, keep it in front of you, never forget about it. It can start with a the smallest routine, you say you used to pray so start there and expand. Productivity is also a cornerstone to feeling accomplished and happy, don&#039;t dwell in your mind all day. Move, build something, even something small. You&#039;ll find your happiness.","time":1491278670,"resto":119427246,"id":"CmCluToA","country":"NZ","country_name":"New Zealand"},{"no":119428713,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)00:07:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119427246\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119427246<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Help<\/span><br>with what? be specific","time":1491278878,"resto":119427246,"id":"YV+sf4rC","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119428783,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)00:08:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"Physical exercise will help you out immensely anon, even something like push ups.

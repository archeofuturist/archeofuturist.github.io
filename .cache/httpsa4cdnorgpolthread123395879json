If you&#039;re talking about universally provided healthcare, which you probably are, yeah probably, although then it becomes more about who would provide it better, the state or private insurers via some insurance mandate. The former is pursued by the UK and many other countries. The latter is pursued by Switzerland and the Netherlands among others. Personally I&#039;m of the opinion that private insurers with a mandate is probably the way to go, just looking at the state of Switzerland&#039;s and the Netherlands&#039; healthcare systems.","time":1493508035,"resto":123395879,"id":"iIonyWhl","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123398150,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)19:21:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"Healthcare is never free.

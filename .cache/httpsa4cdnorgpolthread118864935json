We show you some tactics to effect change at your workplace \u2014 even if it\u2019s only baby steps.<br><br>It was 10 p.m. and my boss and I had just walked out of our last meeting for the day. I was lightheaded with hunger, tired and fantasizing about the moment I could take off my high heels. As we walked to the closest station together, out of the blue he turned to me and asked: \u201cSo, do you make dinner for your husband every night?\u201d<br><br>My eyes narrowed and my neocortex went on red alert. What I really wanted to say was: \u201cHow could I possibly do that? It\u2019s 10 p.m. and I\u2019m here. With you. Working. For the third time this week \u2014 and it\u2019s only Thursday!\u201d Instead, I scrounged around for a comment biting enough to (hopefully) make him think and said: \u201cMy partner works for a gaishikei (foreign company). He leaves work on time and cooks for me.\u2019","time":1490838489,"resto":118864935,"id":"uKtaiow3","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118865377,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)21:48:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118864935\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118864935<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;spelling things requires too much effort.<\/span><br><br>you nasty nigger fart. get the fuck out of here with your stupid gook questions. no ching chong, no bing bong. you rike ding dong?!","filename":"rutrow","ext":".jpg","w":2000,"h":1000,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":62,"tim":1490838519602,"time":1490838519,"md5":"cCvNiYnlDsB\/JipttBMNFQ==","fsize":320473,"resto":118864935,"id":"XgS0I+OQ","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":118865437,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)21:49:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118865317\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118865317<\/a><br><br>(part 2)<br><br>Ingrained Sexism at the Office<br><br>Deeply entrenched beliefs and assumptions like this flourish in Japan\u2019s traditionally-minded office culture. This goes for office environments across the country, where due to the cultural focus on wa (harmony) and gaman (basically, \u201cgrin and bear it\u201d), many women go along with uncomfortable situations and remain silent, since fighting back would paradoxically make them \u201ca troublemaker.\u201d<br><br>Most instances of outlandish behavior come from older managerial types, such as those who summon their female coworkers by calling out, \u201cNe! (Hey!)\u201d or who refuse to see women as anything other than \u201cOL\u201d (office ladies) who take care of the workspace and perform menial tasks. Although the younger generation is not usually so blatantly sexist, it\u2019s easy for men in the Japanese workplace to remain blissfully unaware of how the nature of their comments can affect us.<br><br>While the patriarchal old guard is slowly dying out, we still have to deal with more subtle instances of ingrained sexism. There are many examples of conditions that need to change, but one of the big problems we need to work on immediately is language: how women are spoken to and about. Referring to female colleagues as \u201cgirls,\u201d being labeled with \u2013chan (a diminutive, often used for children) by a superior or having \u2013san (the most basic and polite suffix for Ms. or Mr.) left off your name completely are all common examples. For the most part, however, such situations are usually laughed off as being used affectionately.","time":1490838557,"resto":118864935,"id":"uKtaiow3","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118865540,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)21:50:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118865437\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118865437<\/a><br><br>(part 3)<br><br>The Importance of Being Vocal<br><br>Piercing that bubble of ignorance is the first step in setting things in motion. For instance, not changing my name after marriage came as a shock to most of my coworkers. My directness about my opinion and explanation of the very old-school laws that require Japanese women to change their names after marriage, was the first time any of my male colleagues even realized how skewed the whole issue is. Once the space for discussion opened up, several of my female colleagues became quite vocal about how they hated having to change their names.<br><br>Standing up to micro-aggressions and assumptions is essential. As the only non-Japanese woman in that company at the time, I had a superpower that could be used for good. While many of my colleagues hated being the focus of sexist comments, talked down to and underpaid, they feared speaking up and being labeled uncooperative troublemakers even more. But I could be much more vocal \u2014 my very foreignness acting as a shield, I became a rallying point for the rest of the justly exasperated ladies.<br><br>In a bid to help, I was swift to correct comments and outdated usages \u2014 particularly from managers, who have the most influence on company culture. Like a tennis match, use of the dreaded \u2013chan was consistently rebuffed with the more appropriate \u2013san. Discussion of a coworker\u2019s weight or looks was met with a cold stare or a light question about how that had anything at all to do with her work. Assumptions about someone leaving to get married get batted back with. \u201cOh. Did she tell you that herself?\u201d<br><br>While these actions may seem too minor to make a difference, it\u2019s important to keep in mind that in Japan making a scene is not likely to help one\u2019s argument. Persistent corrections and a firm but low-drama stance make a bigger statement than they would in lower-context societies.","time":1490838619,"resto":118864935,"id":"uKtaiow3","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118865621,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)21:51:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"They don&#039;t even get along with Koreans, what makes you think they&#039;re going to get along with muslims and anime dweebs?","time":1490838667,"resto":118864935,"id":"x+doUPu5","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118865653,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)21:51:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118865540\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118865540<\/a><br><br>(part 4)<br><br>Initiate Quiet but Powerful Storms<br><br>Having worked my way up the ladder and experienced various companies, I do feel there has been some improvement, but things pop up regularly that remind me there is still lots of work to do and we still have to be proactive catalysts of change.<br><br>A few years ago during an important meeting with a client, my boss decided to introduce me as \u201ckono onee-chan\u201d \u2014 in no way a proper term for someone looking after a major account. I was furious, especially as this was not the first time he had done something similar to myself or my colleagues. After debating about what to do \u2014 Am I overreacting? Is this worth a fight? \u2014 I decided that seeking allies with more experience than myself would be the best solution.<br><br>I found them in a pair of no-nonsense senior managers. Ladies who knew far too well what I was talking about and were open to using their clout. Not long after, a company-wide training course was started despite the grumbling of certain members who snarked that \u201cSaying hello would now be considered sexual harassment.\u201d Though the course did not initiate any major changes, it opted for a quiet and deliberate shift of control over the kuuki (literally \u201cair,\u201d but often referring to the atmosphere of a place or gathering).<br><br>Yes.

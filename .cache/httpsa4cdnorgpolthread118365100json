It pointed to things like Jesus&#039; statement: &quot;I have not come to abolish, but to fulfill&quot; and attempted to explain Peter&#039;s vision and various passages in Galatians as not doing away with the the Torah. The book also talks about how anti-Jewish sentiment from figures like Marcion could have contributed to the wholesale rejection of Jewish practice, and interprets Jesus as being more of &#039;the final and authentic interpreter of God&#039;s law&#039;, comparing the efforts of the writers of the Talmud as being a distortion of that.

There is no unified ideology, much like the &quot;alt right&quot; - a diverse array of ideologies fall into this category. We are united in our devotion to the betterment of humanity and to the end of destructive identity politics used by partisans on both the left and the right.

I watched a man who I prayed for betray me. Hillary Clinton promised to go to war with Syria, and Trump promised to prevent it. Yesterday, Trump went to war with Syria. He lied to us all for votes. Being a man of principles, I did not support Trump as much as I supported what he stood for, so when I saw him flip-flop on Syria I was quick to disavow him. I expected to see \/pol\/ to go through mental gymnastics trying to defend him, but instead I saw something beautiful. I saw the board unite and stand for their principles. That gave me a great deal of hope. <br><br>And today, I stepped out of the shower happy and energetic. I was no longer morally obligated to defend Trump, because he was no longer an ally of humanity. The burden was gone. I don&#039;t have to answer for his sins and shortcomings anymore.

There is no unified ideology, much like the &quot;alt right&quot; - a diverse array of ideologies fall into this category. We are united in our devotion to the betterment of humanity and to the end of destructive identity politics used by partisans on both the left and the right. It is the duty of all human beings to improve themselves and the people around them, and with a virtuous population, good policy will naturally come into place.<br><br>What does the alt-left stand for?<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Global diplomacy and cooperation<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Self improvement<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Education<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Health and fitness<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Spiritual development<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Contribution to your community and to humanity as a whole<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Vocal and physical resistance to corruption and anti-human acts<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Preservation of the world&#039;s natural beauty and its environment<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Generosity and wealth redistribution, but the people must be PROUD of this.

Unconditionally even. I campaigned for him and went out of my way to defend him in public. I possibly converted as many as 30 people to the Trump team over the course of that glorious election. <br><br>On Wednesday, I was angry. On Thursday, I was confused. Today, I am happy. I watched a man who I prayed for betray me. Hillary Clinton promised to go to war with Syria, and Trump promised to prevent it. Yesterday, Trump went to war with Syria. He lied to us all for votes. Being a man of principles, I did not support Trump as much as I supported what he stood for, so when I saw him flip-flop on Syria I was quick to disavow him. I expected to see \/pol\/ to go through mental gymnastics trying to defend him, but instead I saw something beautiful. I saw the board unite and stand for their principles. That gave me a great deal of hope. <br><br>And today, I stepped out of the shower happy and energetic. I was no longer morally obligated to defend Trump, because he was no longer an ally of humanity. The burden was gone. I don&#039;t have to answer for his sins and shortcomings anymore. There is a great deal of weight off of my chest, now that I do not have to derive my own beliefs from someone else. <br><br>The future is bright, my friends.","time":1491594513,"resto":120009028,"id":"zBddw\/CB","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120011361,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)15:49:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120010143\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120010143<\/a><br>sjw movment isn&#039;t mainstream. its just being pandered to by the media. average people don&#039;t give a fuck about PC culture or identity politics.

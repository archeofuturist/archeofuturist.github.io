The devaluation of marriage to a mere contract between two parties. This is why fighting against gay marriage is important, as they don&#039;t even want to marry, simply want to normalize faggotry and are devaluing marriage.<br><br>2. Liberalism has convinced people that to be fulfilled they must be &quot;free&quot;, have &quot;self-determination&quot;, &quot;be one&#039;s own master&quot;. In other words, it has put the focus on the individual and not on him plus the context around him. The motto that we are what we are through other people is forgotten. Thus, in marriage, husband and wife no longer are &quot;one flesh&quot;, they no longer are extensions of one another like if you had acquired another whole body to tend to as if it was your own. No, marriage is seen as a burden, as ceding one&#039;s goals and preferences to the other party.<br><br>3. Having kids is seen in the same way as a burden. Kids limit your choice, they impede you from being free. Again, this is predicated on the notion that your kid and you are not &quot;one flesh&quot; but fundamentally separated and individualized.<br><br>4. The pill and feminism together has made female sexual liberation possible. However, men are still biologically wired to want their long-term partners non-promiscuous and loyal. So, there is an omnipresent mistrust nowadays from men towards women, stopping them from committing.<br><br>5. Retarded divorce laws which make marriage a gamble for men. This is especially bad when combined with 4. It means that men have both less reasons to trust women and if they are fucked they are royally so.<br><br>6. The way the labour markets work requires women to commit way too much to their job. In many areas, unless women work like a man would they have no long-term viability in the firm.","filename":"1475247458505","ext":".gif","w":287,"h":187,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":81,"tim":1493354941861,"time":1493354941,"md5":"hbSJddacyOyoayj8ylpTcQ==","fsize":795402,"resto":123144429,"id":"uxksP\/\/s","country":"PT","country_name":"Portugal"},{"no":123149176,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)00:49:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123146802\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123146802<\/a><br>Yet jews marry interracial more than any other ethnic group in america....","time":1493354999,"resto":123144429,"id":"\/L85Ngc7","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123149327,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)00:51:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123146137\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123146137<\/a><br>i felt like that for years until i found a girl just like me a total copy of me and cant stop talking about deep shit, had to wait for years tho and could have not gotten lucky.<br>most of them are shallow","time":1493355069,"resto":123144429,"id":"YJ9W7IqH","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123149599,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)00:53:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123146407\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123146407<\/a><br>Not All Lutherans.

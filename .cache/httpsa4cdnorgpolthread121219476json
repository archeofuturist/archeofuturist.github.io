Like meaning no other superstitions.<br><br>So in Mecca there are loads of historical sites like where Mohammeds sister lived, or where his mum was buried. And people go there and pray. That&#039;s not in the Koran. So the Saudis bulldoze over them. Gone. Only sites directly related to Mo are kept.<br><br>Now he told me that the majority of India and Pakistani Muslims come from the countryside which means they are really superstitions and well, backwards and not &quot;pure&quot;. This affords some buffer against whaabism in the UK.<br><br>It&#039;s similar to a pure fascism ideology in Italy which was thinking of tearing down all the roman ruins and putting up normal concrete buildings instead.","time":1492269932,"resto":121219476,"id":"iDutyZka","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121222334,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)11:43:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121219476\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121219476<\/a><br>In the beginning, Saudi Arabia discovered oil. And the U.S. needed oil, because she herself has been running out of it, thanks to gas guzzlers. So the U.S. needed imports, and Saudi Arabia exported oil for bananas.<br><br>Fast forward to the oil crises, when Saudi Arabia took the red pill and realized that Jews will occupy Arabia, eradicating Muslims with it, and have already began the process by forcing the Arab nations to accept human rights, and leading them to the third world by artificially low oil prices. Saudis tried a last stand against Jews, and formed the OPEC, and made the oil prices rise.<br><br>It worked, and that was the start of the green movement (we cannot afford oil from abroad, and cannot get it ourselves, so find another means to power our industry). Saudis lowered oil price to a realistic level, so the green movement subsidied, and Americans fired up their gas guzzlers once again. Saudis won a battle. But the Arab world was still in the hands of the libertard Jew.<br><br>Saudis thus gathered money, so they only needed weapons to clear minds. And become subtle, so they could do it behind the backs of the Jews. So they invented Wahhabism, and started to spread it using American oil money.<br><br>Fast forward a few years, and we see Arab women back in the kitchen wearing black veils in stead of mini skirts, a high reproduction rate because of outlawed abortion and contraceptives, and a healthy, red pilled society who wants to fight the West.<br><br>And all is OK, with the West, because of libertard religious freedumbs.<br><br>tl;dr: Wahhabism is the Muslim red pill.

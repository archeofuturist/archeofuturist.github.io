Spend 20 grand, you have electricity for 25 years.<\/span><br><br>20 grand for panels is plenty, sure, but if you&#039;re going off grid you need to build an entire electrical system.<br><br>You&#039;re not just going to lay those panels on the ground, so you have to budget for either roof mounting (if your house is oriented the right direction, and have fun cleaning them in the winter) or a freestanding mount. Then you need to buy wire; the longer the distance, the thicker the gauge you need and the cost goes up along with the energy loss.<br><br>You&#039;ll need to store that power, and good batteries aren&#039;t exactly cheap--you&#039;ll spend more on them than the panels. Don&#039;t forget to budget for solar controllers, main panel, breakers, and you&#039;ll want a monitoring system that lets you keep an eye on the health of the batteries and their charge levels (to keep most batteries healthy, you won&#039;t want to discharge them below 50% very often) as well as to track your solar production.<br><br>Add in inverters if you plan on running readily available appliances and tools.<br><br>I&#039;m not saying this to discourage anyone; rather as a warning to not fall into the money pit of thinking it&#039;s all cheap and easy.<br><br>I&#039;ve got over $60,000 into my system, and I built it myself so that doesn&#039;t include labor.","filename":"Mountains6","ext":".jpg","w":1066,"h":800,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1493113130598,"time":1493113130,"md5":"yiIskRQ1O\/DmxIJI3\/KCog==","fsize":334052,"resto":122705519,"id":"6DpHJBnz","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":122716923,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)05:38:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122706584\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122706584<\/a><br>or you could own a generator that runs on bio fuel, and save spare energy in batteries, then use solar panels you stole from traffic signs to supplement your power.<br><br>Also, it isn&#039;t very difficult to get cheap solar, its like a dollar per watt these days.","time":1493113132,"resto":122705519,"id":"Tmi0dFim","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122716960,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)05:39:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122716609\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122716609<\/a>","filename":"np33b8Lari1qjtttio1_1280","ext":".jpg","w":686,"h":960,"tn_w":89,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493113169976,"time":1493113169,"md5":"6\/fS9fTg5Bulv4c7jZrXmw==","fsize":793893,"resto":122705519,"id":"5exQ3d3U","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122717060,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)05:41:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122716960\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122716960<\/a>","filename":"20151110184321628-167450","ext":".jpg","w":950,"h":1425,"tn_w":83,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493113276325,"time":1493113276,"md5":"gr\/i33fLSR6WVzyMqu\/YfQ==","fsize":305507,"resto":122705519,"id":"5exQ3d3U","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":122717106,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)05:42:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122717060\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122717060<\/a>","filename":"201511101838116878-167450","ext":".jpg","w":950,"h":1425,"tn_w":83,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493113326685,"time":1493113326,"md5":"JTCRkJzZNvxqW8C6mqz6XA==","fsize":439584,"resto":122705519,"id":"5exQ3d3U","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":122717153,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)05:42:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122705519\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122705519<\/a><br>Just go on welfare\/disability benefits and wait for shit to go down.","filename":"1480725891649","ext":".jpg","w":330,"h":357,"tn_w":115,"tn_h":124,"tim":1493113367179,"time":1493113367,"md5":"wU4UjJrH7GOJCzj461m+GA==","fsize":16025,"resto":122705519,"id":"1sRXouW4","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122717163,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)05:43:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122717106\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122717106<\/a>","filename":"201511101843218876-167450","ext":".jpg","w":950,"h":633,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1493113381636,"time":1493113381,"md5":"r4rxJvibZIzswqBwqynvmw==","fsize":104833,"resto":122705519,"id":"5exQ3d3U","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122717193,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)05:43:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122717163\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122717163<\/a>","filename":"nnp4tqkvJm1te7qjvo2_1280","ext":".jpg","w":1000,"h":1500,"tn_w":83,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493113413256,"time":1493113413,"md5":"sPvddWINmgRwowYPq16ppQ==","fsize":610312,"resto":122705519,"id":"5exQ3d3U","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":122717337,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)05:46:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122707994\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122707994<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;tfw you&#039;re too poor and young to prep meaningfully<\/span><br><br>Just fuck my shit up senpai","time":1493113580,"resto":122705519,"id":"ETZioNek","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122717515,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)05:48:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122717193\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122717193<\/a><br><a href=\"#p122717337\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122717337<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;too poor and young to prep meaningfully<\/span><br>You should be so lucky to have youth and intellect on your side.

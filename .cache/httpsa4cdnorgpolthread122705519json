Getting off the grid doesn&#039;t mean giving up electricity or the internet or the power grid. It means being prepared. The power grid becomes a backup. But don&#039;t be dependent on electricity. Get as many mechanical items as you can that don&#039;t rely on circuit boards. Exploit everything as the best of both worlds: nature native + technologist. Farming equipment, wells, solar, wind, diesel, propane, wood, coal. You better have your vast stocks of guns, ammo, weapons, medicine, water, purification, batteries, lighting. Stock up on very useful things most people take for granted. Even things as basic as boots and clothes will be hard to get when society collapses.

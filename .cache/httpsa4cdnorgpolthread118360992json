No member would commit his vote before consulting with the entire group \u2014 not even if Trump himself called to ask for an on-the-spot commitment. The idea, hatched by Freedom Caucus vice chairman Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), was to bind them together in negotiations and ensure the White House or House leaders could not peel them off one by one. Twenty-eight of the group&#039;s roughly three dozen members took the plunge.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Three weeks later, Republican leaders, as many as 25 votes short of passage, were forced to pull their bill from the House floor.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Freedom Caucus members told the White House they distrusted Ryan because he doesn\u2019t listen to their concerns. They refused to work with him, going around his back to negotiate with the White House. Little Trump did to woo them worked because the group always wanted more, White House officials and GOP leadership insiders said. They were buoyed by outside groups rooting them on, and didn&#039;t fear the White House&#039;s fury because the law was unpopular \u2014 and, increasingly, so was the president.<\/span>","filename":"House_Freedom_Caucus_logo","ext":".jpg","w":200,"h":200,"tn_w":200,"tn_h":200,"tim":1490534676526,"time":1490534676,"md5":"UJ3uTOijZhHJzP9FFtJxDg==","fsize":8647,"resto":0,"id":"EQoSPUcs","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"hfc-blood-oath-details-that-doomed-ahca","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

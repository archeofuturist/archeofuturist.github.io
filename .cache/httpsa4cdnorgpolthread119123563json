Is not about the leftist, it seems to be a generalized panorama: the right-wing parties are pushing certain gropus to give the false atmosphere that we have to fight against the good ol&#039; enemy: the communism.

Obviously there were certains economical groups which helped to create a bad atmosphere Surrounding all this (bankers). This bad atmosphere and public unrest was used by the right-wing parties as a tool to increase their political and economical power inside the nation. The thing is: I quite agree with right wing, but right wing parties in Colombia are shit. They are disastrous and poisonous and they are using this discomfort for their own greed and not for any improvement of our people.","time":1491011373,"resto":119123563,"id":"CXiXKeOc","country":"CO","country_name":"Colombia"},{"no":119128999,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)21:51:24","name":"Golden*rod*","filename":"Screenshot from 2017-03-31 21:50:24","ext":".png","w":621,"h":575,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":115,"tim":1491011484542,"time":1491011484,"md5":"Rv8TTTAN9JRcnWS38X+B2w==","fsize":343168,"resto":119123563,"id":"251rRIyp","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119129434,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)21:55:55","name":"Golden*rod*","filename":"Screenshot from 2017-03-31 21:55:31","ext":".png","w":628,"h":468,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1491011755286,"time":1491011755,"md5":"gY5NciNGoCXax8\/kFuao\/Q==","fsize":227368,"resto":119123563,"id":"251rRIyp","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119129650,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)21:58:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"Oh Christ please no<br><br>Proxy wars on my fucking doorstep<br><br>You remember how Obama repealed the Monroe Doctrine about halfway through his administration? <br><br>Yeah, I feel we&#039;re going to regret that when Russia and China start repaying bases on their borders with bases on our borders","time":1491011890,"resto":119123563,"id":"6lisQhwm","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

I raised his pay to $30 an hour after the 3rd month, because he was so good that I could focus on adding new customers and increasing revenue.<br>He quit after 4 months, to go to college for &quot;business&quot;.<br><br>Saw him again last month over his Spring break. Now he works as a barista for $8 an hour.<br><br>The guy I hired after him was 29. Started him at $15 an hour because he had a &quot;tech&quot; background.<br>He called in sick (which means I had to still do all the work I hired him to do, plus the work I planned to do) 3 times the first week, twice the second, and 4 days the third week.<br>On the fourth week, he told me he needed salary to keep working for me, because he couldn&#039;t pay his bills with an hourly wage. I fired him on the spot.<br>Of the 6 days he actually worked out of 3+ weeks, that useless fuck called me no less than 20 times each day to ask stupid questions. Never could remember the proper order for a cat5 cable, and was either too lazy or too stupid to do a web search. One customer told me later that she went to check on him when she hadn&#039;t seen him for three hours while he was &quot;fixing her router&quot;.<br>She found him laying on her bed playing games on his phone. This fine example of a millennial has a wife and two kids.<br><br>I don&#039;t bother trying to hire anymore. I got tired of working a hundred hours a week, so I raised my prices until demand fell to a level I can do by myself.<br><br>Fuck employees.

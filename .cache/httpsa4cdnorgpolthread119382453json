While it is convenient to assume that Stone participated in Cohn&#039;s sexual blackmail schemes due to Stone&#039;s reputation, no evidence I have seen indicates this. Stone&#039;s trouble is his own self-promotion. The Dems hate him more than is justified. They hate him more for his gloating, perhaps. He&#039;s been a pain in their ass for decades.Five of his dogs have been poisoned before he was struck himself. I&#039;d say he was on the right track.","time":1491257215,"resto":119382453,"id":"LgnNtLNr","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

What you would be doing would be violation of the UN article 1244, as well as of the constitution of the Republic of Serbia. Due to the fact the Serbian constitution recognized Kosovo as it&#039;s own territory and not a separate entity, any attempt at removing the private property of legally it&#039;s own citizen through force would be illegal and would call for international intervention. Even if America stopped backing us up, with an attack you would be signing your own death penalty, because your government would be, again, ATTACKING LEGAL CITIZEN OF THE REPUBLIC OF SERBIA.

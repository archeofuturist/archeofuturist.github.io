He builds infrastructure in neglected villages as well so the blue collar people love this dude.

I thought the speech was brilliant and really resonated with the turkish people.<br><br>He gives speeches to massive crowds and holds rallies lol. He honestly reminds me of hitler. <br><br>Also you have to keep in mind the turks on this board that hate him are cringey turks trying to be western.

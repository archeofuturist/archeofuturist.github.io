Feminist have engaged in exceedingly strange behavior when their characters get gender bent, social justice warriors expose themselves almost completely when in the face of Drow or any other decent looking evil race. And the worst offenders are when people with these mindsets try to be any evil alignment, where they engage in random acts of dickery or pursue cruel genocides against one specific target, even if it&#039;s just orcs. They are incapable of understanding the subtlety of evil and the idea that being a bastard also includes not being a bastard to your fellow players on a pragmatic level.","time":1493805749,"resto":123876074,"id":"yW1LWy5x","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123896859,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)06:03:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123880973\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123880973<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\/q\/ started seven years ago<\/span><br><br>No fucking way it&#039;s been that long.

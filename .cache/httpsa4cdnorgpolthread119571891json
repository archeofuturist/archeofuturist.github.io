Kevin&#039;s still sore that TRUMPY didn&#039;t name him Secretary of Energy, but gave it to the intellectual giant, Rick Perry, instead. Poor Kevin better not read the latest Quinnipiac Poll that shows 52% of Americans are EMBARRASSED that Trump&#039;s our so-called president. 61% believe that Don the Con&#039;s not honest and 57% believe that tRUMP doesn&#039;t care about average Americans. So, Kevin can have his interns write all the whiny letters he wants, it ain&#039;t gonna do anything but make him look even more stupid. When&#039;s he starting his Senate campaign against Heidi?

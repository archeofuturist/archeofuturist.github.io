The results? Ultra free market libertarian. They were against Government healthcare or business interference in the same way they were against drug war, gun control, and the War in Iraq. They advocated legalizing gay marriage, ALL drugs, an opt-out for Social Security, and to make Affirmative Action illegal. Although still the minority, a much larger than the general public support limiting the Federal Reserve or abolishing it. They also supported using the death penalty more often.<\/span><br><br>http:\/\/www.sodahead.com\/united-stat<wbr>es\/libertarian-atheists-have-highes<wbr>t-iq\/question-2841491\/?link=ibaf&amp;q=<wbr>&amp;esrc=s","filename":"1489892100714","ext":".jpg","w":256,"h":256,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490155869419,"time":1490155869,"md5":"2tlClmRZrVBrdZX++zXhWA==","fsize":22192,"resto":117716815,"id":"LQK7bcSz","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

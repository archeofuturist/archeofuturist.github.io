The ideology of multiculturalism sees only &quot;diversity is always better no matter what&quot; and the ideology of conservatism sees that &quot;we must keep our way of life and only include those who can share it with us, not destroy it.&quot; The right has gained the moral high ground, but the left is not prepared to relinquish its cultural control.<br><br>We will see media insanity. They will tell bolder and bolder lies. People will begin to look behind the curtain for no reason other than the fact that the lies are suddenly way too big and way too ridiculous.<br><br>There will be larger and bloodier riots. They will often be directly motivated by race and religion, and they will be framed as &quot;white vs everyone else&quot; even though the &quot;white&quot; side will have redpilled non-whites in it.<br><br>We are facing major destabilization this year. The narrative is going to crack and people are going to lose their minds. People base their identities on the narrative. when it&#039;s gone, their minds will go with them.<br><br>By the end of the year, people will be much more afraid, most people living in dense urban areas will have been close enough to violence for it to affect them, and the tide will be turning back towards conservatism -- no more sympathy for barbarians.<br><br>by 2020, attitudes will strictly forbid 3rd world trash from living anywhere near real civilization.<br><br>We&#039;ll win, but it will be scary and at times weird things might happen like grocery stores not having enough of certain staples. It&#039;ll be scary but it won&#039;t hurt that bad.","time":1490295446,"resto":117964858,"id":"57X6hCjv","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

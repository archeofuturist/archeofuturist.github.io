At the end of our shift we have to report our cash tips when we clock out. Usually when we clock out it automatically tallies the amount of cash this system thinks we may have made ( it determines this number based on how many cash or card orders we have processed, how much money those orders were, and other factors). If we deviate too much from this automated number, we have to get a manager involved before we can clock out.","time":1491925049,"resto":120606306,"id":"FZcf0YCh","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120611782,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)11:39:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120606306\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120606306<\/a><br>I don&#039;t believe in it.","time":1491925178,"resto":120606306,"id":"D8SkufAJ","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":120612087,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)11:42:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"You know what i think next time i go out and eat at some place i wont be back to im not going to tip.

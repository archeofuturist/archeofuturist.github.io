That&#039;s a huge important thing because if you look at, say, gorillas, their sclera is black. So what does that wind up meaning? Well it means it&#039;s really easy for humans to see where other humans are pointing their eyes. In this video even the dog can do it. He looks at the little girl&#039;s eye trace. Dogs actually have pretty shitty vision. They don&#039;t see colors the way we do, they&#039;re almost all myopic, and their distance vision is limited, but nevertheless that dog sees where the girl looks because our eyes are that well evolved to let others do that.","time":1492142736,"resto":120999356,"id":"cGtwlSvN","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121015500,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)00:06:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121013892\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121013892<\/a><br>Bane?","time":1492142769,"resto":120999356,"id":"PvPPhQUO","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121015503,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)00:06:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121012295\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121012295<\/a><br>this<br><a href=\"#p121012424\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121012424<\/a><br>can&#039;t imagine how bad it must be outside of \/pol. i haven&#039;t posted anywhere else in something like 4-5 years.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;tfw don&#039;t have any socal media accounts and probably never will again<\/span><br>does anyone have a method for reinsertion to the normie matrix figured out?","time":1492142770,"resto":120999356,"id":"+6dSclCm","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121015593,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)00:07:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121009931\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121009931<\/a><br>It&#039;s pretty easy to spot a shill though.

He is still super butthurt that Linux beet HURD (but hey, HURD just got basic sound support in 2016!) and basically tries to claim Linux because Linus used GCC and the GNU coreutils. He survives on the charity of others and speaking engagements where he spouts his insane, paranoid, philosophy. Basically he won&#039;t be happy until all the programmers are homeless hackers like him and all the companies are shut down. How people are supposed to support themselves and their families in that scenario aren&#039;t things he has to deal with because he is basically a permanent grad student. He does make some good points about privacy, but for him, there is no middle ground. Anything that may reduce your privacy even the slightest bit (like movie recommendations on Netflix) is evil according to him, and must be destroyed. In a lot of ways he show classic signs of mental splitting, which is a classic symptom of mental illness. To top it off, when he does write code, he does so in the style of the awful GNU style guide which is a crime against humanity IMHO.<br><br>So, in a nutshell:<br>He&#039;s a bird-fucking, self-absorbed, power hungry, toe jam eating pedophile that thinks everything should be free and everyone should be forced to share, who looks like he hasn&#039;t showered in years so as to create a static shield around his body to protect from aliens. He also created an OS without a kernel because he&#039;s basically Steve Jobs gone communist. Oh, and he calls himself doctor though he holds no PhD.","time":1490923103,"resto":118997591,"id":"8IQlJp1x","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118999038,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)21:21:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118997591\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118997591<\/a><br>Get the fuck off my board you foot eating commie","time":1490923287,"resto":118997591,"id":"douZOCWq","country":"HR","country_name":"Croatia"},{"no":119001626,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)21:43:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118998665\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118998665<\/a><br>keep calm and install gentoo","time":1490924638,"resto":118997591,"id":"4M9sX9sy","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

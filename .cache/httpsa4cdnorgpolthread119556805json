We have to wait for either north Korea to nuke someone or for them to do something unforgivable. Anyhow the norks are innocent mostly (they are being starved and force fed propaganda by Un), it&#039;s their government that&#039;s bonkers, mostly their leader. If for we nuke them that&#039;s millions of civilian casualties to whipe out Un, and he probably has a nuclear bunker so we probs wouldn&#039;t even get him. No, our best bet would be to send in a small team to try to assassinate.<br><br>Either way if they see nukes they fire nukes at South Korea, which is kind of the think we are avoiding, best bet would be to try to get in a small team to assassinate and if that fails everyone&#039;s already fucked so might as well make them a crater.","time":1491361234,"resto":119556805,"id":"n3pkGmyh","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119558001,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)23:04:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119556805\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119556805<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Cuz if we gon go war with the gooks we gon use dem nukes huhhyuck<\/span><br><br>No, it&#039;ll be hellfires all day, every day.","time":1491361471,"resto":119556805,"id":"1P8Ds0vG","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119558438,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)23:08:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119556805\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119556805<\/a><br>What site is the nukemap from?

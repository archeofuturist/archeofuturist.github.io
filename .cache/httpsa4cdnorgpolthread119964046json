I won&#039;t say Trump voters got duped because it was clear as fuck both candidates would&#039;ve marched into Syria. Fucking Bernie Sanders would&#039;ve marched into Syria. Trump will also renegotiate relations with China. He slowly realizes politics isn&#039;t nothing like the Wild West. You guys should be grateful he&#039;s not keeping his promises, it means the Dems won&#039;t blow him the fuck out in 2018.","filename":"1490254915564","ext":".jpg","w":870,"h":960,"tn_w":226,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491578090618,"time":1491578090,"md5":"j4ldQCsyR3CYOQhDsoYEkw==","fsize":76136,"resto":0,"id":"t5xc\/sg4","country":"AT","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"a-vote-for-hillary-is-a-vote-for-ww3","country_name":"Austria","replies":20,"images":1,"unique_ips":13},{"no":119964435,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)11:17:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"I just wanted someone that would bring back the Monroe Dotrine<br>American putting its nose in everything is the reason we dont have nuke ffs","time":1491578235,"resto":119964046,"id":"VWfAfQDk","country":"IT","country_name":"Italy"},{"no":119964731,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)11:19:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119964046\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119964046<\/a><br><a href=\"#p119964435\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119964435<\/a><br><br>We got a Teddy Roosevelt.

This has huge implications in the way the US carries out policy. Another thing is that this was a moral victory for the US, we just said chemical weapons use will not be tolerated and that if you use them there will be repercussions. I will say i do think Assad used them as his army was starting to get pushed back in that region and that he felt emboldened by the US pretty much giving him the green light a week before. But he also just checked Russia who legit didn&#039;t do a damn thing and showed them to be the Paper tiger that they really are. What im curious to see is how China reacts and NK reacts.","time":1491578878,"resto":119964046,"id":"rzsStu6S","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119966283,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)11:28:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119965492\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119965492<\/a><br><a href=\"#p119965368\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119965368<\/a><br><br>check m8","time":1491578910,"resto":119964046,"id":"fTUVHzvd","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":119966403,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)11:29:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119965368\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119965368<\/a><br>Its a checkmate but the faggot wouldn&#039;t tip his king.","time":1491578949,"resto":119964046,"id":"rzsStu6S","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119966515,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)11:29:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119965383\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119965383<\/a><br>Replace the top left mans face with Putin and it&#039;s pretty on point","time":1491578991,"resto":119964046,"id":"HfrOheGl","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":119966854,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)11:31:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119966515\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119966515<\/a><br>why not CIA so it would be even more on point","time":1491579109,"resto":119964046,"id":"fTUVHzvd","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":119967281,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)11:34:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119965368\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119965368<\/a><br><a href=\"#p119965492\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119965492<\/a><br><a href=\"#p119966283\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119966283<\/a><br>It&#039;s a stalemate you utter retards","time":1491579260,"resto":119964046,"id":"oCWNZh4v","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119967488,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)11:35:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119966207\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119966207<\/a><br>This makes sense<br>But its still a letdown for me,since i think Assad should be the leader","time":1491579335,"resto":119964046,"id":"VWfAfQDk","country":"IT","country_name":"Italy"},{"no":119967759,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)11:37:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119967281\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119967281<\/a><br>White piece looks like a queen","time":1491579434,"resto":119964046,"id":"ZofGHVun","country":"RS","country_name":"Serbia"},{"no":119967930,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)11:38:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119966515\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119966515<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; trump lied and is going to war with rusia after all<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; trump is a putin puppet<\/span><br><br>how fucking stupid can a fagot like you be? for fucks sake","time":1491579502,"resto":119964046,"id":"h2sEhCt2","country":"MX","country_name":"Mexico"},{"no":119968094,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)11:39:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119967281\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119967281<\/a><br>Stalemate is when your opponent cannot legally move any of their pieces, but their king is not under attack.","time":1491579566,"resto":119964046,"id":"fTUVHzvd","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":119968166,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)11:39:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119964731\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119964731<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Comparing Trump to Teddy.<\/span><br><br>Seriously stop.","time":1491579590,"resto":119964046,"id":"obZ88hbV","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119968396,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)11:41:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119967488\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119967488<\/a><br>I feel yah man honestly the only proven leaders who have been shown to really succeed in the mid east are pretty much dictators.

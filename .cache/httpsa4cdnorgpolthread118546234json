First of all, the higher taxes have an overall damaging effect to the economy - it is less appealing for a business to establish operations in such a country since it&#039;s going to get taxed. The lack of businesses leads to lack of growth, which leads to less potential &quot;evil capitalists&quot; being available to be taxed, which leads to not enough tax income regardless if they&#039;re already high. That means that to maintain a constant (or improving) rate of government services, the taxes should be raising constantly (due to less and less capital available to be taxed), while never being able to drop. Would you establish a business in such a country when you can just stick with the US?<br><br>Second, the private healthcare sector is eliminated and outcompeted by the state behemoth. The problem here is that the private healthcare sector achieves exactly the same thing, except that it doesn&#039;t need ever-rising taxes to exist. All the potential private hospitals that could&#039;ve been built, aren&#039;t, while every other country&#039;s private sector fills the entire country with hospitals. Given enough time, your state hospitals will lag so far behind that they&#039;ll look like a Soviet hospital from the early 90s while everyone will be just normal. The problem - you won&#039;t have a single private hospital in your land.<br><br>This is generally what happens under socialist states, and the more socialist they are, the more it happens.","time":1490646409,"resto":118546234,"id":"roDvyRI2","country":"BG","country_name":"Bulgaria"},{"no":118557744,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)16:30:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118556444\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118556444<\/a><br>The reason you can subvert political institutions is because the decisions they take on other people are mandatory.

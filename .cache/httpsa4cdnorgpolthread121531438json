Our 4th one was naturally conceived and a total surprise to us both. Very happy. <br><br>Anyway, I know quite a bit about how IVF works because I&#039;ve been through it several times. Female egg quality continues to degrade with her age, and IVF doesn&#039;t fix that. All the eggs your wife will ever have, she had when she was still inside her own mother&#039;s womb. Age 35, 40, and 45 are all inflection points in egg quality decrease. <br><br>Yes, 18 year old men who have no career and no source of income shouldn&#039;t be fathering kids they cannot take care of. That&#039;s why men should always get involved with a woman a few years younger than them - men need extra time to establish themselves as worthy partners, and, women should get married as soon as possible to maximize productive childbearing years, and to minimize the amount of cultural degeneracy that victimizes them.","time":1492441767,"resto":121531438,"id":"Isjm2Ldk","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121536074,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)11:10:32","name":"Anonymous","filename":"IMG_1166","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":693,"tn_w":108,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492441832885,"time":1492441832,"md5":"EDqUtuZv4dRwW+hs8N\/Xxg==","fsize":53213,"resto":121531438,"id":"L+dwnnlg","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121536120,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)11:10:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121535580\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121535580<\/a><br>you could have replaced &quot;netherlands&quot; with &quot;usa&quot; and it would still be accurate mate<br>same goes for most of us civilised types unfortunately","time":1492441853,"resto":121531438,"id":"QOPZtM5n","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121536277,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)11:12:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121535952\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121535952<\/a><br>Wow, nice wall of text for a basement dweller that will never have kids at all. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;not doing your part<\/span><br>A woman will not spit in your mouth even when your tongue is burning.

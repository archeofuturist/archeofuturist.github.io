In a different decade, I was known as Jon Stewart. We also appear in different shapes &amp; forms in your daily comedy diet across multiple networks. But don&#039;t fool yourself, We are just the annointed court jesters of the neo-liberal establishment for spreading brainwashing propaganda under the guise of &quot;comedy&quot;. Over the years, we have successfully subverted the gullible minds of younger generations by inoculating them with already biased narratives peddled by the mainstream media. You must&#039;ve witnessed the extent of brain damage unleashed by our communications in the plague of celebrity-worshipping critical-skills-lacking mainstream-media-munching intellectual-yet-idiot liberal progressives in this world. We are heralded as &quot;talented comedians&quot; in the pop-culture for perpetrating the agenda of our corporate masters deeply entrenched in neo-liberal globalist politics. We would continue to shift the overton window further left as long as our trusted hipster liberal crowd crave their daily dopamine boost for feeling smug &amp; intelligent over hard-working masses.&quot;<br><br>Once you are red-pilled about (((media))), you&#039;d realize that every person &quot;hyped&quot; &amp; incessantly venerated by the neo-liberal establishment serves a critical purpose in their bigger agenda. For (((them))), Obama was a puppet ruler similar to the position of clowns like Stewart or Oliver as puppet propagandists.<br>Every personality, whether politicians or newscasters or comedians or pop-stars - they serve an all encompassing goal championed by neo-liberal globalist establishment.<br><br>This is the reason why Trump&#039;s election was a stunning blow against the stranglehold of neo-liberal establishment on politics &amp; culture. I truly feel sorry for brainwashed liberals who are failing to witness this revolutionary timeline for what it is.","time":1492450955,"resto":121553682,"id":"mfjspqin","country":"IN","country_name":"India"},{"no":121554083,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)13:43:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121553682\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121553682<\/a><br>everything he says he doesn&#039;t want, he helps make happen<br>never saw anybody simultaneously win and lose so much","time":1492451029,"resto":121553682,"id":"T+iX0DId","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121554289,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)13:45:23","name":"IslamIsDeath","com":"<a href=\"#p121553682\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121553682<\/a><br>The cuck king has spoken<br>Praise kek","filename":"JohnOliverCrookedTeeth","ext":".jpg","w":480,"h":360,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1492451123194,"time":1492451123,"md5":"KNxRI1nR3J7NgO5Dy\/641g==","fsize":9533,"resto":121553682,"id":"SX3y8yc3","country":"CO","country_name":"Colombia"},{"no":121554297,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)13:45:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121553933\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121553933<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;digits <\/span><br>Poo&#039;s post was a quality post<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;mfw I&#039;m taking a fat shit while ITT<\/span>","time":1492451126,"resto":121553682,"id":"Cagdyls6","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121554314,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)13:45:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121553682\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121553682<\/a><br>I like how he talks shit about France for the first 14 minutes and then pleads for French people to not vote LePen.","time":1492451133,"resto":121553682,"id":"VFJ3SBBX","country":"PT","country_name":"Portugal"},{"no":121554356,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)13:45:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121554083\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121554083<\/a><br>That&#039;s why the saying &quot;There is no such thing as bad press&quot; is absolutely true.

It&#039;s getting harder to sell derivative products unless there&#039;s some serious value added. And companies know that forking it and separating the their code from the opensource community that maintains and extends it is a pretty stupid move. So they tend to contribute their changes back so that it can be maintained by the community. Otherwise the divergence becomes too much of a hassle for them. Most often, everybody wins.<br><br>It&#039;s mostly like that now but it&#039;s not to be taken for granted. The GPL didn&#039;t come out of nowhere. Companies do try to destroy opensource projects with various strategies. The ideal situation to me is to have both GPL and BSD alternatives.","time":1492958735,"resto":122430732,"id":"BHPAz+eH","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122431715,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)10:45:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122430732\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122430732<\/a><br>Yes, I feel linux and all that shit is made for higher IQ non-lazy people.

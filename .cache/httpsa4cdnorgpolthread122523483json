Toilet paper was used in China from around 875 AD.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In July 1899 Wilbur put wing warping to the test by building and flying a biplane kite with a five-foot (1.5m) wingspan. When the wings were warped, or twisted, one end of the wings produced more lift and the other end less lift. The unequal lift made the wings tilt, or bank: the end with more lift rose, while the other end dropped, causing a turn in the direction of the lower end. The warping was controlled by four cords attached to the kite, which led to two sticks held by the kite flyer, who tilted them in opposite directions to twist the wings.<\/span><br><br>Why did it take humans over 2000 years to build planes and come up with a working concept?!<br><br>They knew about it because .. i mean cmon .. are you telling me nobody build paper planes and threw them around for 2000 years?!<br><br>Who even believes this garbage?! <br><br>Did Humans fly way before the ancient times?!","filename":"Paper-plane","ext":".jpg","w":439,"h":476,"tn_w":230,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492998036546,"time":1492998036,"md5":"nNmJo4ZNnBD6zsaNccIe+Q==","fsize":22785,"resto":0,"id":"1jvRyBt9","country":"DE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-first-use-of-paper-has-been-excavated-in","country_name":"Germany","replies":2,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":122523584,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)21:41:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"sa ge in options field.

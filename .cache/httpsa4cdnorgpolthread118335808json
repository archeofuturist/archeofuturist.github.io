The assimilation campaign was sold to the ethnic Bulgarian majority as an attempt for national &quot;revival&quot; and was called by the authorities the &quot;The Revival Process&quot;.[113] The ideology behind the term, originally used for the less publicized attempts at assimilation of the Pomaks in the early 1970s, was the claim that the targeted minority had originally been Bulgarian before its conversion or assimilation during the period of Ottoman rule. Thus, the assimilation was supposedly justified by it being a restoration of the population&#039;s original &quot;real&quot; identity.<\/span><br>If this happened today, \/pol\/ would cream its&#039; pants.","filename":"1478834750373","ext":".png","w":656,"h":996,"tn_w":82,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490524502062,"time":1490524502,"md5":"\/DUIaxRRXgoKqa39NjRKRQ==","fsize":615881,"resto":118335808,"id":"eNsrjNEg","country":"BG","country_name":"Bulgaria"},{"no":118348458,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)06:35:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118345876\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118345876<\/a><br>Are you a member lad?

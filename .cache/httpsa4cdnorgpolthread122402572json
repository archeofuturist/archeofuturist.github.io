Think of the number games CIA homos used last summer. They said couple millions of such &quot;refugees&quot; boarded EU in similar fashion like those similar pirates used to board SEAORG ships near Somalia. So try adding 2 and 2 and calculate how many Queen Mary 2 cruise liners they would need to perform such operation if capacity of such titanic is about 2000 people plus crew. So it&#039;s very obvious that there had to be &quot;hands on&quot; approach from NATO. Probably using aircraft carriers, unless they only performed this as information psyop to transfer 2 million of fake identities from Wells Fargo cooked books.","filename":"1492864109773","ext":".jpg","w":599,"h":827,"tn_w":90,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492940069116,"time":1492940069,"md5":"Lv4+e\/iYD5EboOCQQMQs7g==","fsize":129918,"resto":122402572,"id":"Njdiv0Tg","country":"LT","country_name":"Lithuania"},{"no":122404462,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)05:36:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122402572\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122402572<\/a><br>I&#039;m confused, these &quot;refugees&quot; are from so called &quot;war-torn&quot; zones and some of the poorest countries in the world yet they all seem to be very well kept, have nice teeth and have decent cloths.

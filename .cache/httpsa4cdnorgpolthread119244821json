How can you say that when most of Europe&#039;s wars boil down to petty landgrabs? Your own island is no stranger to this, look at the fighting between the Anglo-Saxons and the Normans, and then the war of the roses, and the wars with the Scots and Ireland ... and eventually it came down to one kingdom becoming the ruler (The United Kingdom). And because of that, you guys have so many languages throughout Europe from small kingdoms fighting over plots of land.<br><br>This is why you have the European Union, because they wanted to group everyone under a united states of Europe, but what they didn&#039;t understand is that the reason The United States worked is because we all spoke basically the same language wheras Europeans don&#039;t (except for English being the sort of standard language).<br><br>I believe the best form of government will always be semi-dictatorships, with boundaries drawn on ethnic\/cultural lines.

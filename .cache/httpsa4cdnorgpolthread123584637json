Whatever semblance of &#039;democracy&#039; that exists in the business unions (and it&#039;s very, very little) would ensure that the white &#039;workers&#039; would rather support the ambiguous stances of the official labor bureaucracy than to support some pro-immigrant labor stance coming from First-World &#039;Marxist&#039; groups.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Leadership of the First-World trade-unions is simply out of reach for most Marxist-Leninist groups. Either the group must spit a line that is objectively not in the &#039;workers&#039; material economic interests (supporting in the importation of immigrant labor), or they are seeking to lead a Labor Aristocracy and thus might as well stop calling themselves Marxist-Leninists.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The best actual Marxist-Leninist groups could do in the imperialist labor apparatus is to act as spies; write down as much information as possible on how their organizations work and function, get dirt on as many labor leaders as possible, and wait for a time when such information could be useful; i.e., handing potentially violent people the information against particularly loud and vocal imperialist labor lieutenants, in the hopes they end up in a grave.<\/span><br><br>https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/DebateComm<wbr>unism\/comments\/67gbzv\/strategic_pos<wbr>ition_of_immigration_in_marxism\/<br><br><a href=\"#p123584791\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123584791<\/a><br><a href=\"#p123584867\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123584867<\/a><br><a href=\"#p123586761\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123586761<\/a><br><a href=\"#p123587306\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123587306<\/a><br><a href=\"#p123588360\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123588360<\/a>","time":1493620958,"resto":123584637,"id":"1O5kjzcq","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

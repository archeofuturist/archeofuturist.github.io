To profess any political belief without a fundamental understanding of metaphysics, epistemology, and ethics is essentially to take a subjective whim to be an objective truth without knowing why.<br><br>This is, ultimately, why political dialogue in today&#039;s society is shit. We argue endlessly about whether or not certain systems of political organization meet certain criteria, but not of what criteria a moral system must meet. <br><br>The average liberal contends that universal healthcare is good because it provides the greatest good for the greatest number. If you were to ask them, &quot;Why is the greatest good for the greatest number good?&quot;, they would be unable to articulate a satisfactory response.<br><br>The average fascist holds that an authoritarian government is good because it is the only thing that can stop degeneracy. If you were to ask them, &quot;Why is degeneracy bad?&quot; they would be unable to articulate a satisfactory response.<br><br>The average conservative holds that government ought to protect the rights of man. If you were to ask them, &quot;Why does man have rights?&quot; they would be unable to formulate a satisfactory response. <br><br>Because of the enormous philosophical ignorance of the vast majority of the public, we are unable to make actual progress towards TRUTH regarding the optimal system of political organization. Until physicalist metaphysics, empiricist epistemology, and Objectivist ethics prevail a rational political system cannot be constructed, as the general public cannot perceive the reasons for it and will continued to be divided by subjective whims.","filename":"liberty","ext":".jpg","w":425,"h":522,"tn_w":203,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492746558523,"time":1492746558,"md5":"NCv00XmtA6OMeJfMnuRydQ==","fsize":58627,"resto":0,"id":"+k1jg2bl","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"why-political-dialogue-in-todays-society-is-shit","country_name":"United States","replies":5,"images":1,"unique_ips":6},{"no":122093858,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)00:10:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"I wish this post had more responses, it&#039;s actually a wonderful subject to discuss.","filename":"1491453237005","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":1152,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":112,"tim":1492747816919,"time":1492747816,"md5":"w8dy7PRetKQRniLMzONGNw==","fsize":674571,"resto":122091720,"id":"OxC3t\/\/B","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":122094105,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)00:12:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122091720\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122091720<\/a><br>You&#039;re right if people can&#039;t give a satisfactory response to why they should continue to live then it is our duty to kill them on the spot.","time":1492747961,"resto":122091720,"id":"RNMmvSMd","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122094959,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)00:20:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122091720\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122091720<\/a><br>Bumping an interesting thread.","time":1492748439,"resto":122091720,"id":"7K3nEMAd","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122095721,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)00:27:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"Epistemology, metaphysics and phenemonology are vastly important.<br><br>Too bad in most philosophy programs nowadays they just shove French existentialism down your throat.","time":1492748872,"resto":122091720,"id":"90kZ3J0f","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122095907,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)00:29:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122091720\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122091720<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;If you were to ask them, &quot;Why is the greatest good for the greatest number good?&quot;, they would be unable to articulate a satisfactory response.<\/span><br>Basic addition","time":1492748995,"resto":122091720,"id":"9MlEhiuE","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

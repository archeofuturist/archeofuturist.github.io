In ancient Rome only the wealthy could afford to shave every day. Razor blades were VERY expensive and shaving everyday was a sign to others you had a lot of money. it was also predominantly done by those in the city, where social status is flaunted and competed against everyday.<br><br>However, nowadays there is no real clear benefit for shaving because it is so cheap. Sure better razors give you a smoother shave and it&#039;s a more enjoyable experience...but not shaving beats shaving for comfortable experiences.<br><br>Beards were a sign of the working class, those from outside the city.<br><br>But there was also a distant debate...some argued shaving was hygenic, some argued that it was feminine. Some romans claimed that shaving the beard and armpits was hygenic, but shaving any more than that was feminine.<br><br>However the argument can be made that shaving at all is feminine because you are reducing the gender dividers. Women simply don&#039;t grow beards, and if everything was left natural this would be an obvious divider.<br><br>Trannys go so far as to have laser hair removal on their face. Just think you are one step closer to being a Tranny with a shaved face, why not go all the way and get laser hair removal?","time":1492365319,"resto":121388080,"id":"MCupEWw9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121389025,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)13:55:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"Having a beard that actually looks good is more maintenance than shaving.","time":1492365350,"resto":121388080,"id":"0o5iM2RX","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121389039,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)13:55:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121388080\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121388080<\/a><br>I can grow nice hair on top of my head and have a nice jaw; so I don&#039;t need them.","filename":"1475980820795","ext":".png","w":227,"h":219,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":120,"tim":1492365356353,"time":1492365356,"md5":"ygi15varx9u8evX3KaCgqw==","fsize":66200,"resto":121388080,"id":"2PIchwvw","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121389120,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)13:56:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"If you are a longshoreman, or Santa Clause...OK. <br><br>Otherwise...No.","time":1492365394,"resto":121388080,"id":"bbkk2R6o","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121389191,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)13:57:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121389025\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121389025<\/a><br>not if you embrace the curl.

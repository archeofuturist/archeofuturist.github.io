Even being a top tier real human bean with all the coaching in the world from previous leaders and an army of advisors who have overseen events forever, the current conditions of each era are unique to each president&#039;s rule and there&#039;s little you can prepare for. <br><br>New socioeconomic factors pop up frequently, no matter how similar one issue is to something that happened before, doing the same thing again (assuming it worked then) is not likely to work a second time. The new leader will inherit some shit from the last guy, trying to simply undo it or put a bandaid patch on it, while enacting his own ideas hoping they work.<br><br>A bigger issue is that President of the United States is a team position, and many people under the new POTUS are naturally not really on his side. The government of any country is like a pickup game with a group of random selfish assholes on your team - a bunch of career politicians who want to be the MVP and almost never sway from their little clique&#039;s long-standing ideology.<br><br>Leading is a nonstop clusterfuck of trial and error where one third of the people hope you don&#039;t fuck up, one third criticizes you on everything and one third want you dead.","time":1490604729,"resto":118490083,"id":"rFwMtbDr","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118492000,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)04:54:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118490083\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118490083<\/a><br>Because yanks fulfilled their stereotype of putting a hollywood personality above intelligence, even when it came to running their country<br><br>that applies to Hillary too","time":1490604852,"resto":118490083,"id":"GpRZLSz5","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118492013,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)04:54:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;For example, Trump had no idea he would have to hire a new White House staff once Obama\u2019s term ends, and \u201cappeared nervous and uncharacteristically subdued\u201d after the meeting ended.<\/span><br><a href=\"#p118490505\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118490505<\/a><br><a href=\"#p118490203\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118490203<\/a><br>but obama was smart, studied, experienced and knew what he was doing and had people surrounding him that knew as wel","time":1490604860,"resto":118490083,"id":"78Qp\/QcR","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118495691,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)05:50:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"PRETTY FUCKING SURE GEORGE WASHINGTON DIDN&#039;T HAVE ANY PRESIDENTIAL EXPERIENCE","time":1490608220,"resto":118490083,"id":"pb\/IJlQ4","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118495986,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)05:54:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118495691\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118495691<\/a><br>washington was always a strong leader and knew his shit, and the people voted for him because of it","time":1490608499,"resto":118490083,"id":"78Qp\/QcR","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118496079,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)05:56:18","name":"Anonymous","filename":"kellyann","ext":".jpg","w":999,"h":2472,"tn_w":50,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490608578873,"time":1490608578,"md5":"0D\/mE5a3OfwaOgPFaRbdXg==","fsize":1697128,"resto":118490083,"id":"wpVjfC0J","country":"GB","m_img":1,"country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118496178,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)05:57:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118492013\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118492013<\/a><br>Obama did absolutely nothing though.<br><br>Economy was still shit.

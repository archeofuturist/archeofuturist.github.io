From there I dropped out for a year to work at a start up, which took off and is now worth 1 billion dollars. With this story I was able to apply and get accepted to an ivy league school. i am not about to finish my last year early so I can go work at the same start up I left college for originally. However, my degree from the ivy league uni is in environmental sciences and to business, but I think that is ok because I learned a lot of things that I can apply to my business career (things about culture, people, writing, etc. They do make you well rounded I have to say), plus I really like being outside so its been a really nice experience to learn something I genuinely enjoy even thought I will never use it. What this uni did teach me though was how to think critically and articulate my thoughts. I remember sitting on pol five years ago wondering what the fuck was going to happen to my life when I was working at Costco part time and taking classes at night. I know things may suck and I know I got really luck, but I would encourage everyone who is down in the dumps to keep working. I always found encouragement on this website, especially fit, when I was a loser, but now that I have some success I want to keep coming here so I can help people who were like me. I promised myself that if I ever got out of my shit situation I would come back to the prison, kill the guards, free the inmates, and burn this fucker to the ground. Knowing what I know now thanks to pol, I can say that I&#039;m going to try my best to help guys like us who never had a fucking chance to begin with. I love this website and you all were my friends when I was nobody. I appreciate that more than anyone will ever know.","filename":"fullsizeoutput_1e2b","ext":".jpg","w":4500,"h":4326,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":120,"tim":1491172341559,"time":1491172341,"md5":"KSQ9UwiojkGjbLyTbhYpKA==","fsize":1022690,"resto":119253087,"id":"LL+T7UKm","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":119255457,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)18:32:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119253087\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119253087<\/a><br>How&#039;s it feel going to the worst Florida university, faggot?","filename":"1479267766149","ext":".jpg","w":1576,"h":1176,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1491172351636,"time":1491172351,"md5":"FaRGsf1vBz9Jd3DbytzGeg==","fsize":720691,"resto":119253087,"id":"563fWqG2","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":119255502,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)18:32:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"I&#039;ll graduate 2 semesters from now with a degree in economics","time":1491172372,"resto":119253087,"id":"KL4MtHJi","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119255552,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)18:33:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119255432\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119255432<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;i am not about to finish my last year early<\/span><br>Now* not NOT<br><br>i can&#039;t wait to fucking graduate kek","time":1491172393,"resto":119253087,"id":"LL+T7UKm","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119255607,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)18:33:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119253087\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119253087<\/a><br>I have a very important question for OP and anyone else that goes the University of Florida:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Is is ok to call it &quot;U of F&#039;?

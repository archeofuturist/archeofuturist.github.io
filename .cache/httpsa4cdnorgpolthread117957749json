What are the warning signs of being in an evil cult?<br><br>Submission:<br>\u00b0Complete unquestioned trust in the leadership.<br>\u00b0Leaders are often seen as prophets, apostles, or special individuals with unusual connections to God. This helps a person give themselves over psychologically to trusting someone else for their spiritual welfare.<br>\u00b0Increased submission to the leadership is rewarded with additional responsibilities and\/or roles, and\/or praises, increasing the importance of the person within the group.<br><br>Exclusivity<br>\u00b0Their group is the only true religious system, or one of the few true remnants of God&#039;s people.<br><br>Persecution complex<br>\u00b0Us against them mentality. Therefore, when someone (inside or outside of the group) corrects the group in doctrine and\/or behavior, it is interpreted as persecution, which then is interpreted as validation.<br><br>Control<br>\u00b0Control of members&#039; actions and thinking through repeated indoctrination and\/or threats of loss of salvation, or a place to live, or receiving curses from God, etc.<br><br>Isolation<br>\u00b0Minimizing contact of church members with those outside the group. This facilitates a further control over the thinking and practices of the members by the leadership.<br><br>Love Bombing<br>\u00b0Showing great attention and love to a person in the group by others in the group, to help transfer emotional dependence to the group.<br><br>Special Knowledge<br>\u00b0Instructions and\/or knowledge are sometimes said to be received by a leader(s) from God. This leader then informs the members.<br>\u00b0The Special Knowledge can be received through visions, dreams, or new interpretations of sacred scriptures such as the Bible.<br><br>Indoctrination<br>\u00b0The teachings of the group are repeatedly drilled into the members, but the indoctrination usually occurs around Special Knowledge.<br><br>Salvation<br>\u00b0Salvation from the judgment of God is maintained through association and\/or submission with the group, its authority, and\/or its Special Knowledge.","filename":"tmp_10368-Kaaba_2.JPG-1443596964","ext":".jpg","w":1600,"h":1200,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1490290836895,"time":1490290836,"md5":"kaJO69aLGfFlnub6Z51v+g==","fsize":626215,"resto":0,"id":"C3YzzOYj","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"islam-is-a-stupid-evil-cult","country_name":"United States","replies":4,"images":2,"unique_ips":4},{"no":117957997,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)13:42:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"Group Think<br>\u00b0The group&#039;s coherence is maintained by the observance to policies handed down from those in authority.<br>\u00b0There is an internal enforcement of policies by members who reward &quot;proper&quot; behavior, and those who perform properly are rewarded with further inclusion and acceptance by the group.<br><br>Cognitive Dissonance<br>\u00b0Avoidance of critical thinking and\/or maintaining logically impossible beliefs and\/or beliefs that are inconsistent with other beliefs held by the group.<br>\u00b0Avoidance of and\/or denial of any facts that might contradict the group&#039;s belief system.<br><br>Shunning<br>\u00b0Those who do not keep in step with group policies are shunned and\/or expelled.<br><br>Gender Roles<br>\u00b0Control of gender roles and definitions.<br>\u00b0Severe control of gender roles sometimes leads to sexual exploitation.<br><br>Appearance Standards<br>\u00b0Often a common appearance is required and maintained.

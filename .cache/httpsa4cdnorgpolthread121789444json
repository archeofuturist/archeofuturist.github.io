Does anyone else know this feeling? It&#039;s like they are openly nationalist and not ashamed of it. They want to promote good, strong values and beauty and favor the Russian in-group. It&#039;s weird to see media that isn&#039;t ashamed to be nationalist and prideful.<br><br>Is this an unhealthy feeling? American media is just the complete opposite. It&#039;s like our media and politicians are obsessed with making us look shitty and weak, and wanting to promote nationalism is seen as evil. The Russian perception of themselves, just seems a lot healthier than Western attitudes of ourselves.","filename":"Coat_of_Arms_of_the_Russian_Federation.svg","ext":".png","w":479,"h":568,"tn_w":210,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492570199964,"time":1492570199,"md5":"wNvYvQa4QmDJkP0Tm\/dx7Q==","fsize":135526,"resto":0,"id":"Cm2mWyv4","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"whenever-i-see-russian-politicians-and-see","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":121790808,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)23:00:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"Oy vey, russians are killers, they need more sanctions goyim","time":1492570813,"resto":121789444,"id":"rhs\/FK83","country":"AR","country_name":"Argentina"}]}

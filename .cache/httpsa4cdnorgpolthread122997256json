We design and sell cellular coverage systems to the major operators in Canada (Bell, Rogers, Videotron, Freedom Mobile etc). I spend most of my days working directly with employees of Bell, Rogers, Videotron etc. They all seem to share the same following complaints about the CRTC:<br>Anti-competitive regulations<br>- Forcing ISPs to sell space on their large established networks (and new fiber networks) to smaller rivals at wholsesale prices<br>- Barring of foreign investment, preventing real competitors like American ISPs to invest and compete in the Canadian market<br>- Restriction of spectrum. During spectrum auctions the CRTC sets aside a portion of spectrum at a lower price to new industry entrants. This has lead to billions of dollars in investments being wasted by uncompetitive companies on spectrum they don&#039;t end up using, biting off more than they can chew. Public Mobile, Mobilicity and Wind never succeeded and were bought out by larger companies, Videotron still hasn&#039;t used any of their spectrum outside of Quebec. Spectrum needs to be bought by companies that can afford to use it. Subzidizing ISP start-ups with spectrum allocation is not enough to foster competition, it is artificial competition. These small companies can not afford to deploy the technologies necessary to utilize the spectrum sold to them by the CRTC at a pity price, they get crushed by the existing ISPs, no amount of regulation or government subsidy will change this. If we want real competition to step in and challenge the existing Canadian ISPs we must open the market to at least American ISPs.<br>Content regulations<br>- Canadian content quotas enforced upon TV bundles have Canadians paying for channels they never watch.","filename":"20170426_123759","ext":".jpg","w":1915,"h":1076,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1493269566153,"time":1493269566,"md5":"k50hbU7Cgsm94EqMUfgqYw==","fsize":935027,"resto":122997256,"id":"efTpkNxK","country":"CA","m_img":1,"country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122998193,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)01:06:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122998107\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122998107<\/a><br>No way.

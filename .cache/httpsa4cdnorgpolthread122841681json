This is the lowest the unemployment rate has been since May 2007. <br><br>The lowest employment rate in recent memory was 3.8%, in April of 2000. At the current rate of job creation, we&#039;ll hit that just in time for the 2018 midterms. <br><br>However, as we are starting to run out of unemployed people, it&#039;s likely that job creation is due to slow down soon.

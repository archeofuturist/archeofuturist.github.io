Wasn&#039;t planning to go vote, but the cuck on the left kept sending me flier after flier about diversity, muh obongo legacy, and muh russia boogeyman. I even voted Dem for congress in &#039;16, as I have a special hatred of Price. Ended up voting Gray, as he knows what the constitution is and gives me a sense that he&#039;s doing this out of civic responsibility as our founders intended.<br><br>To compare to last election, I saw about as many Ossoff signs as Hillary signs. But I also saw a lot more R signs (Gray, Handel, LeVell) in total compared to Trump signs. Guess it&#039;s due to the competitiveness of the race. Also saw less blacks and poos voting, so I&#039;ve got a strong feeling Ossoff is fucked today and in the future.","time":1492520173,"resto":121680115,"id":"zhcvt8k\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121681607,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)08:58:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121680260\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121680260<\/a><br>Vote Handel you idiots.

And we rained down on them a shower (of brimstone)&quot; - An account that is borrowed from the Biblical story of Sodom. Muslim scholars through the centuries have interpreted the &quot;rain of stones&quot; on the town as meaning that homosexuals should be stoned, since no other reason is given for the people&#039;s destruction. (Inexplicably, the story is also repeated in suras 15:74, 27:58 and 29:40).<br>Quran (7:81) - &quot;Will ye commit abomination such as no creature ever did before you?&quot; This verse is part of the previous text and it establishes that homosexuality as different from (and much worse than) adultery or other sexual sin. According to the Arabic grammar, homosexuality is called the worst sin, while references elsewhere describe other forms of non-marital sex as being &quot;among great sins.&quot;<br>Quran (26:165-166) - &quot;Of all the creatures in the world, will ye approach males, &quot;And leave those whom Allah has created for you to be your mates? Nay, ye are a people transgressing&quot;<br>Quran (4:16) - &quot;If two men among you are guilty of lewdness, punish them both. If they repent and amend, Leave them alone&quot; This is the Yusuf Ali translation. <br><br>Interestingly, the same rules don&#039;t seem to apply in paradise, where martyrs for the cause of Allah enjoy an orgy of virgins and &quot;perpetual youth&quot; Quran (56:17) (interpreted by many to mean &quot;boys&quot; Quran (52:24)). Quran (76:19) bluntly states, &quot;And immortal boys will circulate among them, when you see them you will count them as scattered pearls.&quot; Technically, the mere presence of boys doesn&#039;t necessarily mean sex, however it is strongly implied from the particular emphasis on the effeminacy, handsomeness and &quot;freshness&quot; of the boys.","time":1491495487,"resto":119746782,"id":"aFNBoxoF","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":119758730,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)12:22:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119758232\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119758232<\/a><br>Again.

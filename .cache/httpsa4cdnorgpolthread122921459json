Personally, I think we should end North Korea as soon as possible because they can put satellites into orbit, meaning that if they have nuclear weapons, they can cause an EMP and fry the entire US electric grid. Granted, North Korea would be GONE but some people estimate that 80% of the us population would be dead within a year without electricity.","filename":"Problem Child","ext":".jpg","w":1095,"h":800,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":182,"tim":1493232890531,"time":1493232890,"md5":"IVNwDvaKVMwuBeuohXtXbg==","fsize":349496,"resto":0,"id":"aUQWg3Qo","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"north-korea","country_name":"United States","replies":10,"images":1,"unique_ips":8},{"no":122921590,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)14:55:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122921459\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122921459<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Hi, I get all my opinions and knowledge from Buzzfeed and Infowars.<\/span>","time":1493232956,"resto":122921459,"id":"oAYTH3Pa","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122921830,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)14:58:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122921459\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122921459<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;80% of the US population would be dead in a year without electricity<\/span><br>Do you really believe that?","time":1493233088,"resto":122921459,"id":"jFqrOu1u","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122921837,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)14:58:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122921590\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122921590<\/a><br>Redpill me then.","time":1493233090,"resto":122921459,"id":"aUQWg3Qo","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122921944,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)14:59:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122921830\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122921830<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Welfare system is down<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;gun owners defend their homes from looters<\/span><br>Yeah, it&#039;s believable.","time":1493233151,"resto":122921459,"id":"aUQWg3Qo","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122922175,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)15:01:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122921459\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122921459<\/a><br>The problem child is clearly Drumpf<br>The NK comedy is just to get away from Russian Investigations<br>Garrison has a man cruch on Trump, he&#039;s a closet faggot","time":1493233262,"resto":122921459,"id":"FXee4xN3","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":122922344,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)15:02:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122921837\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122921837<\/a><br>The NK satellite doesn&#039;t work.

We have 3 choices with NK:<br><br>1) Continue playing around with sanctions, verbal putdowns and whatever else for decades to come. Kim will keep the threats coming but nothing will likely happen.<br><br>2) Completely ignore them and ask the media to stop covering them as well. Kim&#039;s threats only work if you give them any sort of attention. Kim will keep doing them however and we&#039;ll never know if the next time is the one or just threat #1234324324332.<br><br>3) Take him out. I would try to get Russia or China to hit first if possible. I&#039;d evacuate South Korea if I could and just strike and strike in one swoop like no one has done before. While this does run the risk of someone getting nuked, that risk won&#039;t go away as long as he is there and unless someone takes him out from inside, we are left hoping that future descendants of his are more agreeable. We get rid of him and the problem is solved. I would much rather have Russia or China take over NK or have them install a puppet government than to deal with him. We might be able to work with Russia\/China. We are never going anywhere with NK, but we will destroy them in a matter of weeks, if not days.<br><br>But the big conclusion I reach out of all of this though is that we should have taken care of business in the 80&#039;s or 90&#039;s before they got nukes.","time":1493234070,"resto":122921459,"id":"\/d0oYE7N","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

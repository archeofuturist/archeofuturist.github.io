This isn&#039;t the harshest place for ideologies. It isn&#039;t necessarily pleasant, but it isn&#039;t that bad either.<br>I would say it is one of the harshest places on the internet and the criticisms made are some of the harshest.<br>The question I asked to reach that conclusion was &quot;Why is society listening to the NEETs all of a sudden?&quot; and the only answer that made sense was &quot;The pain the NEETs have felt is now their pain as well&quot;.<br>I agree with the rest of your post.<br>A lot of the issues with NEETs is due to a largely non-monogamous society. Monogamy increases productivity by providing stable consumption and production from people with families and it inspires even the less desirable and motivated to work hard for their children. Give a man a loyal wife and a couple of kids to carry on his name and legacy and you&#039;ll have someone willing to grind his nose to the pavement every day to get them ahead.<br>But otherwise, why bother? You can live and make enough money for hobbies without putting yourself in nearly as much stress.","filename":"1459132024985","ext":".jpg","w":704,"h":2000,"tn_w":44,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492492699471,"time":1492492699,"md5":"FmWU74qaQ8V85Hqdus5\/Hw==","fsize":268695,"resto":121602823,"id":"yJS15Ddo","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":121643208,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)01:19:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121638324\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121638324<\/a><br>Kyle and his men picked this guy out and couple others, apparently they were organising the Antifa guys so they targeted them in the choas.

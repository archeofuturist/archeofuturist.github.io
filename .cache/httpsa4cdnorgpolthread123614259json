During that race, opponents of Jackson called him a jackass. However, rather than rejecting the label, Jackson, a hero of the War of 1812 who later served in the U.S. House of Representatives and U.S. Senate, was amused by it and included an image of the animal in his campaign posters. Jackson went on to defeat incumbent John Quincy Adams and serve as America\u2019s first Democratic president. In the 1870s, influential political cartoonist Thomas Nast helped popularize the donkey as a symbol for the entire Democratic Party.&quot; http:\/\/www.history.com\/news\/ask-his<wbr>tory\/how-did-the-republican-and-dem<wbr>ocratic-parties-get-their-animal-sy<wbr>mbols<br><br>This is the ultimate test of \/pol\/&#039;s influence. Can we make the democrats abandon their own party icon? Yes we can!<br><br>TLDR - The democrat donkey symbol was started by a slave owner, therefore we can force SJWs to back its removal.","filename":"KickThemInTheirAss","ext":".jpg","w":800,"h":800,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493641351409,"time":1493641351,"md5":"sBWy0M4orZeslpsSN656iA==","fsize":180959,"resto":0,"id":"2dZGUvfq","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"kick-them-in-their-ass","country_name":"United States","replies":12,"images":1,"unique_ips":7},{"no":123614587,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)08:25:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"http:\/\/www.keyc.com\/story\/35288268\/<wbr>st-olaf-students-boycott-over-racis<wbr>t-messages<br><br>I found a group of SJWs for you, OP.","time":1493641543,"resto":123614259,"id":"S6B\/FjJM","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123615058,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)08:30:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123614587\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123614587<\/a><br>I think that if we can get this to take off on just a few college campuses, it will spread everywhere and put the Democrat party into chaos.","time":1493641832,"resto":123614259,"id":"2dZGUvfq","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123615670,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)08:36:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123614259\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123614259<\/a><br>Hory shit is this for real?","time":1493642185,"resto":123614259,"id":"wqINVNj5","country":"VN","country_name":"Vietnam"},{"no":123616400,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)08:43:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123615670\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123615670<\/a><br>It is.

I also observed many videos showing anti-antifas were bearing basic shields. <br><br>Now let me get one thing clear: Making a shield wall with strangers isn&#039;t easy. <br>however, IF we were to get a couple of dozen people to align side to side, the rest would intuitively know to join and align properly. Then get one or two to follow close behind each shield bearer, we would effectively have a shield wall formation against antifa. No doubt that such formation would throughly destroy their disorganized\/light infantry behaviour. However, it is important that there be loners wandering by the shield wall&#039;s side, to avoid flanking. Cavalry would be ideal but that&#039;s impossible. Undoubtedly a barely organized wall would just march over antifa, no way they can stop the solid mass of marching men and women.<br><br>So what&#039;s up \/pol\/? Why haven&#039;t we got basic formations to face up against these filthy barbarians? Do you think such a thing would be even possible?<br><br>It&#039;s also relevant that such formation would be useless against a well trained, well equipped policemen shield wall formation.<br><br>Pic relevant, just replace the shields with something more crude, swords with sticks, helmets with biking helmets, etcetera.","filename":"jorvik-viking-festival-2015-warriors-form-a-shield-wall-near-cliffords-eg6chj","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":447,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":174,"tim":1492389668008,"time":1492389668,"md5":"w3OrmSkCieqhMFo1Z7AcKw==","fsize":126818,"resto":0,"id":"bPbT4t+3","country":"BR","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"so-i-was-watching-the-following-video","country_name":"Brazil","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

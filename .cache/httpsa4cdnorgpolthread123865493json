He raised a little over $100,000 by selling some of his paintings, and set out for Detroit. There, he worked with a local team to take apart the house, which had fallen into extreme disrepair.<br><br>He then shipped the wooden exterior to Berlin, where he spent the winter painstakingly rebuilding it, mostly alone, by hand. \u201cIt was an act of love,\u201d he said.<br><br>The house is partly visible from the street, so people can get a glimpse of it even if the Mendozas are not at home. Visitors are not allowed inside the house, for insurance reasons, but also as a sign of respect. \u201cThis house was abandoned, people came inside,\u201d Mr. Mendoza said. \u201cI want it to have its dignity.\u201d<br><br>On a recent Saturday, a dozen visitors dropped in. \u201cIt\u2019s surreal that it\u2019s here,\u201d said Norberto Romero, a photographer who lives in the neighborhood.<br><br>\u201cIt\u2019s strange no one wants it in the U.S.,\u201d said another visitor, Marcus Kelch, who works with handicapped children, and looked up Rosa Parks on the internet to find out who she was.<br><br>His friend Dennis Lumme nodded. \u201cIn Germany, it\u2019s different,\u201d he said. \u201cI just read that in the Ravensbr\u00fcck women\u2019s concentration camp, people want to make a monument for lesbians who were killed. We try to memorialize every group that suffered.\u201d<br><br>The friends were silent, as they considered the transplanted house\u2019s peeling paint and battered wooden boards. \u201cBerlin is definitely the right place for this house,\u201d Mr. Lumme said after a moment. \u201cEvery meter you walk is full of memory.\u201d","filename":"rosaparkshouse","ext":".jpg","w":1960,"h":1336,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":170,"tim":1493782441802,"time":1493782441,"md5":"S3tvucCVAe7NlLG4XkfWgg==","fsize":632052,"resto":0,"id":"z3aKPPzC","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"rosa-parks-house-shipped-to-germany-for","country_name":"United States","replies":18,"images":6,"unique_ips":14},{"no":123865680,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)23:35:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123865493\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123865493<\/a><br>Why are Europeans so obsessed with America<br><br>it&#039;s like they&#039;re all living vicariously through us<br><br>fuck off and worry about yourselves","time":1493782545,"resto":123865493,"id":"\/1Pe\/BM\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123865778,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)23:36:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123865493\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123865493<\/a><br>No shit no one wants it, you think niggers care about Rosa Parks?","time":1493782599,"resto":123865493,"id":"hMcGZbHx","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123865914,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)23:37:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"Shouldn&#039;t we be saving her bus seat not her shitty house?","time":1493782669,"resto":123865493,"id":"yEHuIphs","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123865976,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)23:38:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123865680\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123865680<\/a><br>that&#039;s what happens when your the greatest nation on earth <br><br>get ready for some angry yuropoor butthurt","filename":"1489018562957","ext":".jpg","w":394,"h":395,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493782704580,"time":1493782704,"md5":"JCYLYiSn6RQWuV9aIQAtpw==","fsize":36357,"resto":123865493,"id":"VuUxtSEw","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123866072,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)23:39:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123865680\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123865680<\/a><br>They need protection from the Russians","time":1493782760,"resto":123865493,"id":"4fL+cvzU","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123866145,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)23:39:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"why the fuck does GERMANY want this dumb bitches house?<br><br>wtf lol krauts literally are the biggest cucks on earth","filename":"1280px-Flag_of_Germany.svg","ext":".png","w":1280,"h":768,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":75,"tim":1493782798408,"time":1493782798,"md5":"F5gcqo55Y9fbB+lyK02oig==","fsize":5686,"resto":123865493,"id":"VuUxtSEw","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123866159,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)23:40:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123865976\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123865976<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;yuropoor<\/span><br>I refer to them as &quot;Euro peons&quot;","time":1493782805,"resto":123865493,"id":"\/1Pe\/BM\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123866330,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)23:41:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123865976\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123865976<\/a><br>Europeans are weird.<br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Nativ<wbr>e_American_hobbyism_in_Germany","time":1493782890,"resto":123865493,"id":"yMOvFEZT","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123866345,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)23:41:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123866145\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123866145<\/a><br>Mr mendoza sounds like some foreign faggot who just rents the space here","time":1493782896,"resto":123865493,"id":"TDago\/Uv","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":123866361,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)23:41:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123865493\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123865493<\/a><br>Now watch as it gets burned down by a pack of &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;refugees&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;","time":1493782906,"resto":123865493,"id":"FTwZ\/7ZN","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123866489,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)23:42:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"She was born in Tuskegee and made history in Montgomery.

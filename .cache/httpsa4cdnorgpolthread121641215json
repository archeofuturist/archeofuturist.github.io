Hypothosis: These are the first items to be &#039;lost&#039; by the events of climate change as they are in the hot zones. Notes: Most people who came looking were not too disturbed. One individual thought he saw fish sauce at the back shelf but it was actually soy sauce I had placed there - I believe this demonstrates the &#039;folly&#039; of seeing technological fixes as a way to prevent the issues with climate change. Overall, I was not too concerned on day 1 and even had hope<br><br>Day 2: Plastered fake &#039;possibly radioactive&#039; stickers on produce from Indian subcontinent and removed some items from Bangladesh Hypothosis: India and Pakistan will have a nuclear skirmish due to climate change therefore irradiating food Notes: Many people seemed confused and did not purchase the products. Had to cut experiment short because a man spoke to a staff member then pointed at me. Overall I believe that this proves people cannot understand the way climate change harms the food supply.<br><br>Day 3: Entered supermarket late at night and poured ants into the carrots. Hypothosis: This represents pests becoming widespread due to the warming climate in the north Notes: Nobody took the carrots and seemed disgusted. Clearly proves people will not eat pested crops and may resort to cannibalistic behaviour within 3 days of the collapse.<br><br>This is a small experiment but I think is telling.","filename":"climate change","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":720,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1492491603555,"time":1492491603,"md5":"uPVZr1\/04rBTggaHtCE1Tw==","fsize":153621,"resto":0,"id":"3icPBaG8","country":"CA","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"in-the-last-few-days-i-have-been-running-small","country_name":"Canada","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

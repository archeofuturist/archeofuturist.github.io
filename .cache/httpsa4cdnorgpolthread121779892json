We have way too many fucking posers, queers and LARPers like Dick Spencer in the &quot;alt-right&quot;. <br><br> They do it for book deals and as a fucking hobby. Real fascists are fascist for the sake of being fascist, not to be a fucking Crusader RPer. We don&#039;t see ourselves as defenders of anything other than a civilized society with opportunity for all. Our enemies are ideological enemies, not enemies for superficial reasons (race, gender, etc.). We strive to reach high positions in medicine, academics, politics, finance, etc., we don&#039;t make up these shitty &quot;Institutes&quot; that are just circlejerks for people who say the same thing over and over.<br><br> The alt-right does this thing where they take easily defensible arguments and fuck it up so bad that the entire argument is nullified just for superficial stuff. Look at &quot;white genocide&quot;. Nobody is killing off whites systemically, it&#039;s just that liberalism and socialism has made white males (a huge demographic of the academic world) effeminate through academia (run by socialists), that they take the LGBT fad and refuse to procreate. And when they do marry, they are into &quot;open relationships&quot;, thus, the white birthrate goes down. <br><br> These fucking faggots are the worst thing to happen to fascism in it&#039;s history. Stormfaggots are going to be the first to go if fascism ever wins, for that reason alone.","time":1492567191,"resto":121779892,"id":"PcBPr\/q6","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121783326,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)22:04:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121782643\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121782643<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;i&#039;m a clueless civic nationalist, please put a bullet through my brainstem !&quot;<\/span><br><br><a href=\"#p121779892\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121779892<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;alt-right<\/span><br>Hello rabbi.","filename":"1474706393738","ext":".png","w":1808,"h":3731,"tn_w":60,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492567476469,"time":1492567476,"md5":"fQDlhZ83PxHCx8RC2TsslA==","fsize":623890,"resto":121779892,"id":"NhzOBZRi","country":"FR","m_img":1,"country_name":"France"},{"no":121783719,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)22:07:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;alt right<\/span><br><br>Lets stop pretending like that is a real thing","time":1492567654,"resto":121779892,"id":"GduAybWL","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121783770,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)22:07:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121783326\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121783326<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; im a clueless ethnic nationalist and a faggot, please blow a load in my ear<\/span>","time":1492567679,"resto":121779892,"id":"PcBPr\/q6","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121785439,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)22:20:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121779892\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121779892<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;alt-right<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Stormfags<\/span><br>pick one faggot leaf, lurk moar or fuck off back to <a href=\"\/r\/catalog#s=eddit\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;&gt;\/r\/eddit<\/a> you normalfag retard fuck -- leafs should stop posting, they lower the collective IQ of the board","filename":"soon_leaf_soon","ext":".jpg","w":687,"h":900,"tn_w":95,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492568412977,"time":1492568412,"md5":"NF30dHxrR1KyW\/VsH9medw==","fsize":109851,"resto":121779892,"id":"\/22J5K0k","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121785667,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)22:22:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121785439\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121785439<\/a><br><br>He is partially correct, in that Stormfags are trying to hijack the right-wing movement in the United States.","time":1492568520,"resto":121779892,"id":"PcBPr\/q6","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121785851,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)22:23:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121785667\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121785667<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;He is partially correct<\/span><br>&quot;stormfags&quot; =\/= alt-right<br><br>take your leaf friend and go back to <a href=\"\/r\/catalog#s=thedonald\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;&gt;\/r\/thedonald<\/a> cucks","filename":"(you)","ext":".jpg","w":852,"h":480,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1492568615594,"time":1492568615,"md5":"ywHFBF6s8xasyo1CLIGZlg==","fsize":119203,"resto":121779892,"id":"\/22J5K0k","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121786095,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)22:25:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121785851\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121785851<\/a><br><br>You are right, but still an imbecile for not understanding that Stormfaggots refuse to take the &quot;=\/=&quot;.

Like any culture that&#039;s been impoverished for generations there&#039;s a self-defeating cycle between behavior and opportunity. However here&#039;s some things that would help.<br><br>1. School voucher program: This is Betsy Devos coming in. We have a horrible public school system and giving kids the opportunity to branch out could be huge.<br><br>2. Stop affirmative action. The fact that a kid in a trailer park is somehow deemed privileged over a kid in a section 8 is reprehensible. <br><br>3. Manufacturing economy.

Charge missile infantry.<br>Antifa make use of an old Roman and early-modern tactic of screening their lines with shitty troops (small women and nu-males) while people behind them throw rocks, explosives, and bottles. You can&#039;t see them or get to them, because the screen is in the way. This is also how Eric Clanton moved in to attack the dude with his bike lock, hiding behind for the right moment to strike. The right-wing needs to shut that shit down immediately. Get a group of guys together (at least 10) and charge en masse at the antifa lines. The antifa women will scatter, allowing you access to the fuckers in the back. Use shields and sticks to rain hell on these fuckers.<br><br>2. Organization<br>The above will be much easier with greater organization. In the early moments of the event (or preferably before), you should agree on a Commander and various Captains. Each captain leads a detachment of men (5-10). If the commander calls a charge, everyone pushes forward with shields and scatters the Antifa. Captains govern their men in the melee and can call mini-charges and move them tactically to respond to specific threats. This will help with pitched battles and will also help avoid antifa&#039;s #1 tactic: picking off individual guys and tripping them so eight other communists can stab and kick him on the ground.<br><br>3. Study Pre-Modern Fighting<br>Nobody&#039;s brought guns yet, so you&#039;re basically in pre-modern fight-mode, again. Look at the Roman legionary. Heavy shock infantry. When the legionaries charge, they throw javelins to soften up and disrupt the enemy formation. You should do the same. Every Defender should be armed with a can of bearspray, eyeprotection and a mask. As you move into charge, raise your bear spray and fire into the eyes of the Antifa. Empty the fucker if you want, or shoot for a few seconds then holster. This will disorientate and disrupt the antifa lines. Follow up the spray with your charge, with your shields and rubber batons\/flagpoles ready.","filename":"Anti-Com Cannae","ext":".jpg","w":1440,"h":830,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":72,"tim":1493168203079,"time":1493168203,"md5":"slkI5Sedzn1nzBP+Z4Q27g==","fsize":155364,"resto":122814758,"id":"zW+RPwcK","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":122817303,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)20:57:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122816994\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122816994<\/a><br>Really great way to hide the fact you are a nigger faggot shill.","time":1493168234,"resto":122814758,"id":"PLD6qBUV","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122817407,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)20:58:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122814758\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122814758<\/a><br>Better communication.

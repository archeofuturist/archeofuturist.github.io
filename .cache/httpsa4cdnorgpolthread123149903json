When you believe everything you&#039;re doing in your life is completely meaningless in the end. Then you realize everything you do is just for your own enjoyment.

The issue comes from the claim that he is malevolent. If evil can be used to form a more meaningful good\/more good\/whatever or come by logical necessity of some good then you cannot make the claim that God is malevolent letting evil occur. However, evil does not &quot;exist&quot;, it is simply a privation of the good.<br><br>A good example of the benefit of evil in theology is the doctrine of Free Will. Something created with the intent of experiencing love and sharing in God&#039;s love requires the ability to voluntarily choose to love, else the love is mechanical and not actually love. <br><br>This can be applied to things naturally in the world as well, such as the finite and distinct nature of the universe enables things to run up against one another and cause clashes which cause a lot of things.

It could allow an important good, it could break your heart so that it be more open, it could be a method of transformation, or it even could be repercussions of sins playing out to persuade you away from it. <br><br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Redem<wbr>ptive_suffering<br><br>We must try to relieve suffering but we do not relieve it by attempting to escape it but relieve it by overcoming it.

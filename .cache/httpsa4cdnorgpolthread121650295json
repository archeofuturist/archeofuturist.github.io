I hate how city assholes think natives are &quot;peace pipes and teepees&quot;. The problem I see is the same thing that plagues inner city blacks: No positive role models. Living on a rez quickly makes you feel like there is no future worth living. You&#039;re just stuck in a small town around gossiping family and teens with multiple kids. Oxy and hydro pills ensure that no real money gets saved. There are no jobs that can ensure a wealthy future unless you get lucky and get a tribal council job. The kids that get a college education often leave the rez and never come back.<br><br>In my old job on the rez I had to hire people (gas station job). Natives, without a doubt, were the hardest workers. The catch: it was for 2 weeks. They were gone after the first paycheck, usually to apply again 2 months later for a job again. I am a veteran too, and I&#039;ve noticed that natives are some of the best soldiers in the US. Problem is they hit the booze so goddamn hard stateside that they go AWOL\/ get booted.<br><br>I&#039;m all for more sovereignty for the rez&#039;s, but I think the first issue would be fixing small communities and giving the youth a clearer path to success. Gang culture isn&#039;t as strong as in black culture, so I think the leap to being successful isn&#039;t nearly as far for Natives.<br><br><br>ps: what are your thoughts on the fuckwits that say &quot;I&#039;m part Cherokee&quot;?

The report also cited Lowery\u2019s e-mail as the one piece of documentary evidence showing the degree of anger inside the agency at Chaffetz and the desire for the information to be public.<br>Lowery had been promoted to the post of assistant director for training just a month earlier as part of an effort that Secret Service Director Joseph Clancy said would reform the agency after a series of high-profile security lapses. Clancy had tapped Lowery to join a slate of new leaders he installed after removing more than two-thirds of the previous senior management team.<br>During the inspector general\u2019s probe, Lowery denied to investigators that he directed anyone to leak the private information about Chaffetz to the press and said his e-mail was simply a vent for his stress and anger.","time":1493177432,"resto":122830883,"id":"S7XILTPI","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122836427,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)23:31:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122835973\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122835973<\/a><br>The Chaffetz file, contained in the restricted database, had been peeked at by about 45 Secret Service agents, some of whom shared it with their colleagues in March and April, the report found.

The Daily Beast first reported on April 2 that Chaffetz had once been rejected for a job at the service. The Post reported additional details later that evening.<br>One official told The Post that the material included a parody poster that pictured Chaffetz leading a hearing on the Secret Service from his congressional dais, with the headline \u201cGot BQA from the Service in 2003.\u201d Within the Secret Service, \u201cBQA\u201d is an acronym meaning that a \u201cbetter qualified applicant\u201d was available.<br>Roth\u2019s report said investigators were unable to pin down how The Post and the Daily Beast obtained their information. \u201cBecause of the significant number of individuals who had knowledge of Chairman Chaffetz\u2019s application history, we were unable to conclusively determine the universe of sources of the disclosure ... to individuals outside of government,\u201d the report said.<br>Roth himself has faced criticism over his handling of the investigation because he allowed inspectors from the Secret Service\u2019s internal affairs office to sit in on interviews and question some witnesses alongside his investigators. Legal experts and former government investigators have said the service\u2019s involvement was a potential conflict of interest because top officials at the agency had an incentive to embarrass Chaffetz. Experts also expressed concerns that it could deter internal whistleblowers from coming forward with additional allegations of misconduct, for fear of retribution by their bosses.","time":1493177701,"resto":122830883,"id":"S7XILTPI","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122837177,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)23:38:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122835973\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122835973<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;http:\/\/archive.is\/xLG8z<\/span><br><br>HORY SHET DON&#039;T LET THIS SLIDE","filename":"eb4","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":486,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":101,"tim":1493177932672,"time":1493177932,"md5":"XdMPF26AUz2CG9Q8FFJCtg==","fsize":32944,"resto":122830883,"id":"aAw2ceHp","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122837385,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)23:40:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122830883\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122830883<\/a><br>Why is \/pol\/ able to accurately locate flags and people in a few hours but totally poked in the dark on this case?

I feel like I&#039;m in the vast minority of the Earth&#039;s population who saw no benefit to it, besides the personal gain of Trump drawing attention to himself.<br><br>Firstly, it clearly changed nothing: the side who lost the airfield bombed the same city again, just to prove to Trump he had no effect on them. Secondly, shouldn&#039;t America be aiding the side who owned the airfield and not the terrorists? Thirdly, would America have liked it if another country appeared out of nowhere and started throwing rocks during their own civil war 150 years ago?<br><br>I&#039;m struggling to grasp the worldwide praise for this attack. It just seems like Trump was sending a &quot;hey look at me, over here&quot; message to both sides, so that once this war is over and Syria is in a weakened state from outside attack regardless of who wins, Trump will easily invade and conquer if Assad decides to take revenge, or if the terrorists win, Trump will just go in with full support and start an invasion himself.<br><br>Please prove me wrong and insult me all you like.

The rebels have used sarin gas before (pic) and the inspectors obviously did not inspect them. Unless they used everything, they would still have some, probably stored in the middle of rebel held territory. The inspectors were declared to have been successful, John Kerry said they had removed 100%. <br><br>However, reports are also that this was chlorine gas with trace amounts of sarin. We know that Assad has used chlorine gas several times - it&#039;s not covered by all the same chemical weapons conventions. For the most part it doesn&#039;t kill outright, it just strongly irritates the eyes and lungs with some permanent damage potential and can kill if unlucky \/ exposure is very high. We know that the sarin gas recovered was stored poorly and haphazardly - so it is possible that this was chlorine gas deliberately used, but unknown to them had trace amounts of something more harmful.<br><br>Trump was given several alternatives, including destroying the entire Syrian air force, and this, rather symbolic attack. <br><br>If Trump had not taken this action, international pressure would probably have grown. After all, it was something like 60+ killed in a chemical weapons attack. The desire for &quot;regime change&quot; is also extremely strong, amongst the same groups favoring the removal of Gadaffi. Given the extremely strong political desire to remove Assad, it&#039;s very likely that an investigation would have found him guilty - either because he was guilty, or because a lack of information would have produced a &quot;most likely&quot;-conclusion, or somewhere in between these.<br><br>cont.","filename":"Syria sarin","ext":".png","w":741,"h":4957,"tn_w":18,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491921454205,"time":1491921454,"md5":"G8+pv5Kvv1a18eqMacMXCA==","fsize":1961162,"resto":120599514,"id":"A0g\/70sk","country":"NO","m_img":1,"country_name":"Norway"},{"no":120604967,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)10:39:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120602583\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120602583<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Implying that those 59 tomahawk missiles plus 13,000 in storage aren&#039;t already payed for<\/span><br><br>Get out of this thread you fucking retarded kike","time":1491921558,"resto":120599514,"id":"a6ziMihX","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":120605081,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)10:40:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120599514\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120599514<\/a><br>the jews got him. the end. time to move on.","time":1491921629,"resto":120599514,"id":"huH2uLVF","country":"CH","country_name":"Switzerland"},{"no":120605429,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)10:43:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120604786\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120604786<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Rationalizations<\/span><br>He bombed Syria to look tough compared to Obama, that&#039;s it","time":1491921833,"resto":120599514,"id":"3WDETAQJ","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120605728,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)10:46:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120604786\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120604786<\/a><br>So the path of &quot;doing nothing&quot; would have probably meant war against Assad.<br><br>The path that Trump chose has many benefits:<br><br>- It does not damage relations with Russia particularly much - they were warned well in advance<br>- It does not meaningfully harm Assad&#039;s ability to fight ISIS - the damage appears limited to some buildings and scorch marks on the pavement - very little considering literally 30 tons in warheads was sent.<br>- Initial reports on the ground were zero casualties, later reports that the deaths happened during firefighting. Syria has an incentive to play up the damage.<br>- Syria does not consider themselves at war with the US - the statement issued was that the US has taken an act of aggression, not an act of war<br>- It seriously damages the &quot;collusion with Russia&quot; narrative, quite helpful to Trump at the moment - he is politically weak now and gets a breather<br>- It&#039;s implicitly a mark against Obama, who was on the way to reach saint status with leftists<br>- It demonstrates US willingness to use military power to the world - it was done as Xi Jinping visited the US, thereby encouraging China also to help deal with North Korea, which might otherwise not have been possible<br><br>- It defuses most of the situation re the chemical weapons - the pressure that was about to build and build against Assad was just punctured and halted in shock and surprise at Trump&#039;s action.

I feel like I&#039;m in the vast minority of the Earth&#039;s population who saw no benefit to it, besides the personal gain of Trump drawing attention to himself.<br><br>Firstly, it clearly changed nothing: the side who lost the airfield bombed the same city again, just to prove to Trump he had no effect on them. Secondly, shouldn&#039;t America be aiding the side who owned the airfield and not the terrorists? Thirdly, would America have liked it if another country appeared out of nowhere and started throwing rocks during their own civil war 150 years ago?<br><br>I&#039;m struggling to grasp the worldwide praise for this attack. It just seems like Trump was sending a &quot;hey look at me, over here&quot; message to both sides, so that once this war is over and Syria is in a weakened state from outside attack regardless of who wins, Trump will easily invade and conquer if Assad decides to take revenge, or if the terrorists win, Trump will just go in with full support and start an invasion himself.<br><br>Please prove me wrong and insult me all you like.

The rebels have used sarin gas before (pic) and the inspectors obviously did not inspect them. Unless they used everything, they would still have some, probably stored in the middle of rebel held territory. The inspectors were declared to have been successful, John Kerry said they had removed 100%. <br><br>However, reports are also that this was chlorine gas with trace amounts of sarin. We know that Assad has used chlorine gas several times - it&#039;s not covered by all the same chemical weapons conventions. For the most part it doesn&#039;t kill outright, it just strongly irritates the eyes and lungs with some permanent damage potential and can kill if unlucky \/ exposure is very high. We know that the sarin gas recovered was stored poorly and haphazardly - so it is possible that this was chlorine gas deliberately used, but unknown to them had trace amounts of something more harmful.<br><br>Trump was given several alternatives, including destroying the entire Syrian air force, and this, rather symbolic attack. <br><br>If Trump had not taken this action, international pressure would probably have grown. After all, it was something like 60+ killed in a chemical weapons attack. The desire for &quot;regime change&quot; is also extremely strong, amongst the same groups favoring the removal of Gadaffi.

If it wasn&#039;t a false flag he responded appropriately. All he did was bomb an airfield storing the chemical weapons - targeting aircraft and infrastructure while avoiding personnel - after warning the Russians. No Russian casualties = No WWIII. Currently conflicting reports on SAA casualties - Pentagon says none, SAA says yes one dead. Doesn&#039;t matter. By targeting the air base and not Assad&#039;s headquarters (like Libya) he demonstrated this had NOTHING to do with regime change. Just sending a message.<br><br>2. He just put Assad in check while sedating Neo-Cons like McCain, liberals who want Assad gone, and Israel (who are the people who would have supported the false flag). He&#039;s winning over support from people stonewalling him with a glorified firework show. <br><br>3. He&#039;s being tough on China and North Korea. He was meeting with the leader of China today.

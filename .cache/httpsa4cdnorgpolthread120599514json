I feel like I&#039;m in the vast minority of the Earth&#039;s population who saw no benefit to it, besides the personal gain of Trump drawing attention to himself.<br><br>Firstly, it clearly changed nothing: the side who lost the airfield bombed the same city again, just to prove to Trump he had no effect on them. Secondly, shouldn&#039;t America be aiding the side who owned the airfield and not the terrorists? Thirdly, would America have liked it if another country appeared out of nowhere and started throwing rocks during their own civil war 150 years ago?<br><br>I&#039;m struggling to grasp the worldwide praise for this attack. It just seems like Trump was sending a &quot;hey look at me, over here&quot; message to both sides, so that once this war is over and Syria is in a weakened state from outside attack regardless of who wins, Trump will easily invade and conquer if Assad decides to take revenge, or if the terrorists win, Trump will just go in with full support and start an invasion himself.<br><br>Please prove me wrong and insult me all you like. I know I&#039;m in the minority and I just want to know why I&#039;m in the minority.","filename":"Trump-Syria","ext":".jpg","w":898,"h":701,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":195,"tim":1491918514979,"time":1491918514,"md5":"5OSI9RIreBTKgcdtVI0B4A==","fsize":72369,"resto":0,"id":"e3i2QI+2","country":"AU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"can-we-rewind-for-a-second","country_name":"Australia","replies":19,"images":3,"unique_ips":19},{"no":120600621,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)09:59:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"Because it draws us closer to completing the protocols of Zion you filthy goy","time":1491919144,"resto":120599514,"id":"1J4d8idq","country":"MX","country_name":"Mexico"},{"no":120600748,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)10:00:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"because Assad is literally Hitler who was genociding the innocent toddlers living in a Leppo","time":1491919219,"resto":120599514,"id":"slnqfcGL","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120600783,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)10:00:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120600621\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120600621<\/a><br>Yeah this it&#039;s in the interest of Israel so of course it&quot;s a good thing","time":1491919246,"resto":120599514,"id":"BP9KnzXZ","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120600868,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)10:01:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120599514\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120599514<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;why Trump bombing Syria was a good thing<\/span><br><br>Why not?","time":1491919302,"resto":120599514,"id":"qVbX\/hCo","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120600965,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)10:02:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120599514\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120599514<\/a><br><br>they will be less likely to use chemical weapons if they know they will be bombed<br><br>this is a fact. any attempt to say otherwise is admission of defeat","filename":"1491339913349","ext":".jpg","w":564,"h":549,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":121,"tim":1491919356210,"time":1491919356,"md5":"+sBGV\/UTaU9Ihe9GB3R7Lw==","fsize":80141,"resto":120599514,"id":"WzfJXXzB","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120601072,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)10:03:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120599514\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120599514<\/a><br>Im thinking it was a combination of the msm thinking &quot;fuck we look like idiots with our psychotic anti Trump stance but we can&#039;t save face unless he does something praiseworthy&quot; *bombs syria* &quot;omg greatest president ever hail trump&quot;, and Trump trying to do anything to stave off the Russian puppet narrative.<br><br>Now the chips have fallen and we&#039;ve regressed back into our comfort zone of having a neo Cohen in chief","time":1491919414,"resto":120599514,"id":"FYWdx+YI","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120601121,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)10:04:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120599514\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120599514<\/a><br><br>because it put a swift end to the hysterical media bullshit about russia and the election","time":1491919441,"resto":120599514,"id":"WTto2erY","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":120601233,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)10:05:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120599514\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120599514<\/a><br>Doesn&#039;t mean make any sense <br><br>Some of us are still spouting the 4D chess meme <br><br>Others have accepted that we&#039;re probably cucked and fucked <br><br>Ps fuck kek","time":1491919506,"resto":120599514,"id":"EtgChq9u","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120601412,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)10:06:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120599514\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120599514<\/a><br>It is not a good thing, ((they)) must have something on him.<br><br>Notice how all the media sites love him now? dead giveaway","time":1491919606,"resto":120599514,"id":"c27BkJBh","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120601453,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)10:07:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120599514\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120599514<\/a><br>Unless you are a kike, nothing the US government does is a good thing.","time":1491919633,"resto":120599514,"id":"TqLZUXKO","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120601691,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)10:09:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120599514\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120599514<\/a><br>The attack was to show that he&#039;s not afraid to slap them around if he has to, even if he has to go against the whims of his country to do it.

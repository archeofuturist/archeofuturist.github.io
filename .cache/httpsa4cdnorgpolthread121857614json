Around Africa colonial powers were withdrawing and granting the populace majority rule. Meaning blacks were now in charge. In some cases this went well and were somewhat stable, but in most it went to hell. Rhodesia, not wanting to become a nightmare overnight. The Rhodesian front, led by Ian Smith, wanted a more moderate transition to majority rule that would take place over time. England did not agree, so Rhodesia said fuck it and declared indepence. As Sith put it. &quot;I don&#039;t believe in majority rule ever in Rhodesia\u2014not in 1,000 years, I repeat that I believe in blacks and whites working together. If one day it is white and the next day it is black, I believe we have failed and it will be a disaster for Rhodesia&quot;<br><br>First and foremost international support was next to nothing. Rhodesia was kept afloat by South Africa and Portugal because of mutual interest of keeping stability in the region. The rest of the globe condemned them. England, run by a Labour party parliament being the strongest influence. Being on the UN security council they had a massive sway on public perception. It doesn&#039;t help that the UN is stocked with bleeding heart &quot;global citizens&quot; and has been since it&#039;s inception. <br><br>Once Portugal withdrew that opened the floodgates for more insurgents to come over the border through Mozambique. To counter this, the Selous Scouts conduced OP Eland in 1976 where they killed thousands of guerrillas in a &quot;peaceful village.&quot; The guerrillas originally claimed that it was the South Africans who did the &quot;massacare&quot; as reported by the UN which forced the had of South Africa to end support. They had their own problems to deal with.

Despite this the insurgents were brutal in their coercion of the populace, a practice called &quot;stoning the dog,&quot; was often done to shock villages. &quot;Stoning the dog&quot; involved picking a woman from the village, claiming she was a witch against them, then forcing the rest of her community to stone her to death. From there they would force the village to feed and shelter them. There are two reasons why. First, insurgents rely on the support of the local populace.

A staple of insurgencies is to make yourself look like the good guy overthrowing an oppressive ruler. For ZANU-PA and ZAPU this was easy, Rhodesia was viewed internationally as a bunch of backwards racists that are getting in the way of progress and freedom in Africa. To westerners unfamiliar with Africa, it was a nice way to virtue signal that they actually give a shit despite not knowing or having to live with the consequences. <br><br>Rhodesia was fighting an uphill battle when it came to PR. Despite the well documented fact the insurgents were murdering whites, blacks, missionaries, and coercing a populace to support them, Rhodesia still had the stigma attached to them. It was easy for the rest of the planet to sidestep the atrocities committed by the insurgents because of a narrative pushed by the insurgents and sympathetic voices of racism and oppression. The UN was by far the biggest factor in that perception. <br><br>I mentioned OP Eland earlier and how the UN went with the insurgent narrative of &quot;wholesale civilian slaughter.&quot; that is just one of many examples. For every sucessful Rhodesian OP there was a whole slew of lies published by the insurgents and pushed by the communists to keep the positive PR on their side. It was easy for the UN to dismiss the reports as lies published by the Rhodesian Government to cover up what they are doing and stay in power. Little did they know that in a few decades they would be putting sanction on Mugabe because he slaughtered 30,000 blacks from another tribe that opposed him politically. <br><br>Cont.","time":1492620497,"resto":121857614,"id":"+aXzyvYK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121864494,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)12:49:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121864153\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121864153<\/a><br>Do you have the greentext?","time":1492620587,"resto":121857614,"id":"ggWtdLwM","country":"AR","country_name":"Argentina"},{"no":121864594,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)12:50:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121864153\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121864153<\/a><br>Are you next going to tell me that we&#039;re not really taking over Tuvalu?<br>Wtf","time":1492620642,"resto":121857614,"id":"pUeYb0++","country":"RS","country_name":"Serbia"},{"no":121864842,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)12:52:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121864153\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121864153<\/a><br>That&#039;s why I called it larp","time":1492620771,"resto":121857614,"id":"S3hlzUp7","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"},{"no":121864912,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)12:53:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121857614\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121857614<\/a><br>Communism.","time":1492620807,"resto":121857614,"id":"HRdDY5KJ","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":121865504,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)12:58:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121860211\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121860211<\/a><br>best Rhodie song.<br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=RVs<wbr>NDSZWcOI","time":1492621108,"resto":121857614,"id":"TKzV18D7","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121865601,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)12:59:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121857614\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121857614<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What went wrong<\/span><br><br>Britain went soft, and had Labour governments.","time":1492621159,"resto":121857614,"id":"GMNuYgv9","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":121865664,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)12:59:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121857614\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121857614<\/a><br>The Queen was pissed off that yet another colony wanted independence.

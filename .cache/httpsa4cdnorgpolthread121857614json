Around Africa colonial powers were withdrawing and granting the populace majority rule. Meaning blacks were now in charge. In some cases this went well and were somewhat stable, but in most it went to hell. Rhodesia, not wanting to become a nightmare overnight. The Rhodesian front, led by Ian Smith, wanted a more moderate transition to majority rule that would take place over time. England did not agree, so Rhodesia said fuck it and declared indepence. As Sith put it. &quot;I don&#039;t believe in majority rule ever in Rhodesia\u2014not in 1,000 years, I repeat that I believe in blacks and whites working together. If one day it is white and the next day it is black, I believe we have failed and it will be a disaster for Rhodesia&quot;<br><br>First and foremost international support was next to nothing. Rhodesia was kept afloat by South Africa and Portugal because of mutual interest of keeping stability in the region. The rest of the globe condemned them. England, run by a Labour party parliament being the strongest influence. Being on the UN security council they had a massive sway on public perception. It doesn&#039;t help that the UN is stocked with bleeding heart &quot;global citizens&quot; and has been since it&#039;s inception. <br><br>Once Portugal withdrew that opened the floodgates for more insurgents to come over the border through Mozambique. To counter this, the Selous Scouts conduced OP Eland in 1976 where they killed thousands of guerrillas in a &quot;peaceful village.&quot; The guerrillas originally claimed that it was the South Africans who did the &quot;massacare&quot; as reported by the UN which forced the had of South Africa to end support. They had their own problems to deal with. Two years later Smith compromised and the country became Zimbabwe Rhodesia. <br><br>Cont.","filename":"troopies2","ext":".jpg","w":1200,"h":630,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":65,"tim":1492618558697,"time":1492618558,"md5":"y3ii72ne3ZGx9YlWnrk0yw==","fsize":90157,"resto":121857614,"id":"+aXzyvYK","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":121860763,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)12:16:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121860116\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121860116<\/a><br>Also alot of \/pol\/ is supportive of Assad and the Syrian government, to end proxy war fuckery there.<br> <br>And they&#039;re not western European white.","time":1492618594,"resto":121857614,"id":"koen2mTp","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":121861270,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)12:21:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121860697\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121860697<\/a><br>Indeed yes, didn&#039;t also Israel support Rhodeisa? or was that next to nothing?","time":1492618888,"resto":121857614,"id":"koen2mTp","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":121861300,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)12:21:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121861270\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121861270<\/a><br>Rhodesia*","time":1492618906,"resto":121857614,"id":"koen2mTp","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":121861781,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)12:26:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121860697\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121860697<\/a><br>Second. The Communists. China and the Soviet Union played a large part in propping up the two dominant insurgent groups, ZANU-PA led by Mugabe and ZAPU led by Joshua Nkomo. In almost every single engagement the insurgents were beaten. But with the massive amount of equipment thrown at them by the communists they were able to prop themselves back up even after total crushing defeats after OP Dingo and OP Eland. Insurgent commanders even admitted in an interview that they were knocked flat.<br><br>Both insurgent groups were in favor of land reform with sounded great to many tribesmen living in Rhodesia. Despite this the insurgents were brutal in their coercion of the populace, a practice called &quot;stoning the dog,&quot; was often done to shock villages. &quot;Stoning the dog&quot; involved picking a woman from the village, claiming she was a witch against them, then forcing the rest of her community to stone her to death. From there they would force the village to feed and shelter them. There are two reasons why. First, insurgents rely on the support of the local populace. Second PR, which I will get to later.","time":1492619165,"resto":121857614,"id":"+aXzyvYK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121861955,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)12:27:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121861270\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121861270<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121861300\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121861300<\/a><br>Yes.

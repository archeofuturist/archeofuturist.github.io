There&#039;s not much evidence for the Library of Alexandria holding information on advanced, for the time, technology. We&#039;d likely understand the ancient world a bit better but not a whole lot since most of the books and scrolls were also available elsewhere. Alexandria was mostly special because it held information from around the known and parts of the unknown world in one place. Much of that information was also kept elsewhere, though spread around rather than centralized.","time":1490104240,"resto":117625016,"id":"mG9wRfjO","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117625829,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)09:54:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117625105\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117625105<\/a><br><br>WUZ","time":1490104494,"resto":117625016,"id":"vEvceajM","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117625894,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)09:55:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117625511\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117625511<\/a><br><br>Remember who destroyed the great library of alexandria the muslims.

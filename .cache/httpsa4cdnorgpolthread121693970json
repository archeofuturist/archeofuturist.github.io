Christianity stifles a person&#039;s will and ability to change the world for the better because it constantly affirms the idea that things for us are just going to get progressively worse and worse until the angels come to save us.<br><br>No angels will save us, but things will get worse and worse if you continue to think that this is how things are supposed to be to fulfill a prophecy. If you believe in a prophecy like that, then you&#039;re always sort of wanting it to be fulfilled, to be vindicated. In my mind that is the core, cancerous weakness of christianity. Its followers ultimately want to be vindicated by oppression, subjugation, and in the end, near-annihilation.","filename":"1479767524216s","ext":".jpg","w":208,"h":206,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":123,"tim":1492532033352,"time":1492532033,"md5":"sqr1gpWRv\/55UAv+tw99aQ==","fsize":4482,"resto":121693970,"id":"qLVRa08T","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121702006,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)12:16:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121693970\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121693970<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I&#039;ve been interested in becoming a serious Christian<\/span><br>Are you stupid?","filename":"is this b","ext":".jpg","w":384,"h":480,"tn_w":100,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492532199101,"time":1492532199,"md5":"upaR06nGJZCKapqH6WaJ0Q==","fsize":103401,"resto":121693970,"id":"fRAZIGYH","country":"AR","country_name":"Argentina"},{"no":121702391,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)12:19:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121693970\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121693970<\/a><br>I&#039;ll save you the time and effort by providing you with topics in which you should study, eschatology included.<br><br>Amillennialism<br>Post-Tribulation &quot;Rapture&quot;<br>Covenant Theology (ant-Zionist Christian)<br>Calvinist<br>Annihilationsm<br>Partial Preterism<br><br>There are many antichrists, it&#039;s a spirit, or zeitgeist of the times.","time":1492532390,"resto":121693970,"id":"Mg4FzMWn","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121702500,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)12:20:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121701696\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121701696<\/a><br>Fuck off ahmed.

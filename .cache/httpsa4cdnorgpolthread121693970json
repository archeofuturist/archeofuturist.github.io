What is the nature of the Antichrist? Is there a serious happening in store for this year? <br><br>Christian anons help me. I&#039;ve been interested in becoming a serious Christian for about a year and a half and the red dragon happening has inspired me to get serious. I read the Book of Revelations and other assorted parts of the Bible for history class (private school) when I was 15 and had to defend them against liberal classmates, which is when i decided Christianity was right. Now I&#039;m 19 and in college and I still haven&#039;t started going to church, but I do pray several times a day (usually before meals, when I wake up, and before i go to bed).","filename":"antichrist ","ext":".jpg","w":650,"h":340,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":130,"tim":1492528068294,"time":1492528068,"md5":"z1jCvIEGAor7DyP4H5HzVA==","fsize":249443,"resto":0,"id":"kObZ\/1Cl","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"antichrist-and-end-times-prepping","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

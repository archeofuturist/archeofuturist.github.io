Six cases of rat lungworm disease have so far been confirmed in Maui in the last three months, with more episodes currently being investigated. Given the island had only experienced two documented cases of rat lungworm in the decade before this outbreak, the sudden increase is causing concern. Rat lungworm disease is caused by the parasitic roundworm Angiostrongylus cantonensis, with the adult form of the parasite found only in rats. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The infection is spread when rats carrying the parasite excrete the larvae of the roundworm in their faeces. From there, it can be picked up by other animals, such as snails, slugs, freshwater shrimp, crabs, and frogs. If people handle or consume any of these infected animals \u2013 or come into contact with them on contaminated food sources, such as raw fruit and vegetables \u2013 they too can become infected.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;For many, there are no symptoms, and most people recover from the infection on their own. But in some cases, the worm moves into the brain and nervous system, resulting in a parasitic form of meningitis that can cause intense headaches, tremors, numbness, and fever symptoms \u2013 and which can ultimately turn out to be fatal.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;The parasites are in the lining of my brain, moving around,&quot; Maui resident and preschool worker Tricia Mynar, who believes she contracted the infection while on the Big Island, told Honolulu Civil Beat. &quot;It was like someone suddenly took a lei needle and pushed it through the soft spot on top of my head, then pushed it down below my left ear, then up to my left temple, then moved from back to front behind my right eye. As the lei needle pain shot out through my right eye there were flashing white lights,&quot; the mother of three says.<\/span>","filename":"Angio_cycle","ext":".png","w":1400,"h":630,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":112,"tim":1491815697297,"time":1491815697,"md5":"ZJ+plw75XekOY8bqvQD1qg==","fsize":1095653,"resto":0,"id":"D2+67BTe","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"hawaiian-brain-parasites-on-rise","country_name":"United States","replies":10,"images":4,"unique_ips":10},{"no":120417278,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)05:15:52","name":"Anonymous","filename":"1457858182905","ext":".gif","w":252,"h":263,"tn_w":119,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491815752719,"time":1491815752,"md5":"0ZjoWxrI5SEG1VvyjwM1fw==","fsize":3131478,"resto":120417211,"id":"E5V3YXYt","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120417281,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)05:15:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120417211\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120417211<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The Hawaiian Islands on the whole usually average about 10 cases of rat lungworm per year, according to state epidemiologist Sarah Park, who says the symptoms are as random as they are terrifying. &quot;If you could imagine, it&#039;s like having a slow-moving bullet go through your brain and there&#039;s no rhyme or reason why it&#039;s going to hang out in this part of the brain or that part of the brain,&quot; she told Associated Press.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;As for what&#039;s caused such a spike in Maui recently, nobody&#039;s entirely sure, but there are concerns the parasite is being spread by a rise in numbers of an invasive semi-slug in the region, with as much as 80 percent of the species carrying the roundworm.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Behind that, it&#039;s possible that increasing globalisation and shipping is to blame for the distribution of the parasite, which was first identified in Taiwan in 1944, but which has spread far and wide in the last few decades.<\/span><br><br><br>What can Trump do to stop foreign invaders from assaulting our native citizens?","time":1491815753,"resto":120417211,"id":"D2+67BTe","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120417555,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)05:19:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"tl;dr Hawaii and Taiwan have fucking BRAIN PARASITES that will kill you.<br><br>Glass them both.","time":1491815964,"resto":120417211,"id":"dM2KG\/DH","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120417988,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)05:25:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120417211\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120417211<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;cases of worms in people&#039;s brains are increasing<\/span>","filename":"IMG_7155","ext":".gif","w":173,"h":164,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":118,"tim":1491816309320,"time":1491816309,"md5":"13W2Zb5S6ELpzAcgEIN5lQ==","fsize":183783,"resto":120417211,"id":"aF4ueP+w","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120418102,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)05:26:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120417211\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120417211<\/a><br>My first thought, was WATCH OUT FUCKERTURD","time":1491816404,"resto":120417211,"id":"Skmj9yQW","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120418184,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)05:27:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120417211\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120417211<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;snails, slugs, freshwater shrimp, crabs, and frogs<\/span><br><br>don&#039;t have to worry then I guess","time":1491816476,"resto":120417211,"id":"TpnqPaer","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":120418411,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)05:31:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120418184\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120418184<\/a><br>yes except its also anything those animals come into contact with<br><br>so if you eat some vegetables that have been contacted by parasite controlled snail or eat a fish that ate a parasite controlled shrimp, you could end up fucked","time":1491816673,"resto":120417211,"id":"N7ugqhA3","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120419158,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)05:42:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120417211\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120417211<\/a><br>Hawaii anon here kinda forgot about this gonna be extra careful.","time":1491817333,"resto":120417211,"id":"SuADg6Gi","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120419918,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)05:51:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120417211\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120417211<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;raw fruit and vegetables<\/span><br><br>vegans and homos BTFO","filename":"1f8b6e4316a5d8437f7e04f2f79f723a","ext":".jpg","w":564,"h":282,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":62,"tim":1491817915550,"time":1491817915,"md5":"LB\/Ujr5KtpdnJgSMjnpyUA==","fsize":38766,"resto":120417211,"id":"kpk3TgLn","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120423162,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)06:35:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"Why do parasites cause negative effects?

I&#039;ll never forget arguing over who would win Pennsylvania, poring over poll results, and ousting the shills and commies. It was an honor to brigade online polls about the election and vote down propaganda on Jewtube. I truly believe that the actions of us and our brothers helped bring Trump to victory. In honor of those memories, let&#039;s share our favorite memes, pastas and nostalgia from that time.","filename":"1493173221003","ext":".jpg","w":720,"h":960,"tn_w":187,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493177124794,"time":1493177124,"md5":"QzxOrO0hqBuxSpgaLHTXmA==","fsize":139697,"resto":0,"id":"2h6vy6yV","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"election-nostalgia-thread","country_name":"United States","replies":22,"images":16,"unique_ips":10},{"no":122835928,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)23:27:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122835679\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122835679<\/a><br>Too bad President Trump blows dick.","time":1493177242,"resto":122835679,"id":"\/NaMj1rX","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122835982,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)23:27:54","name":"Anonymous","filename":"vote from home","ext":".png","w":1200,"h":1247,"tn_w":120,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493177274980,"time":1493177274,"md5":"OgCS5FtUz3kkWg0Ulq6mFg==","fsize":825455,"resto":122835679,"id":"2h6vy6yV","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":122836127,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)23:29:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122835679\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122835679<\/a><br>I can get behind this thread, even if it is a slide.","filename":"108908fjj","ext":".jpg","w":800,"h":606,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":94,"tim":1493177358633,"time":1493177358,"md5":"GhlJqwapFB1IYOxcodlC3A==","fsize":56132,"resto":122835679,"id":"Hkm8KVDS","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122836206,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)23:29:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122835928\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122835928<\/a><br>are you a shill or simply a spineless defector? post some fucking memes you faggot","filename":"is this real life","ext":".jpg","w":622,"h":475,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":95,"tim":1493177397569,"time":1493177397,"md5":"UcAfJXJHL4aGi+8RN8gt2w==","fsize":74043,"resto":122835679,"id":"2h6vy6yV","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122836234,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)23:30:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"this is one is after the election but still relevant<br><br>im currently making screencaps of <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;drumpf will be impeached because RUSSIAAAA<\/span>","filename":"muh electoral college","ext":".jpg","w":2551,"h":2835,"tn_w":112,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493177415081,"time":1493177415,"md5":"q8iscm1VEHQVOGo84gVtgw==","fsize":2122955,"resto":122835679,"id":"pbnyvJQj","country":"MY","m_img":1,"country_name":"Malaysia"},{"no":122836307,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)23:30:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122835679\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122835679<\/a><br>I mean don&#039;t get me wrong, I voted for him, but he&#039;s starting to pull back from his promises.

What does exposure to space does to your body? <\/span><br><br>if you&#039;re in a suit, all you get is space radiation, if you stayed their for like 100 years you would probably get cancer or two because of it<br><br>On Earth you don&#039;t get radiated by space because of the planet&#039;s magnetic field. Fun Fact: Mars doesn&#039;t have a magnetic field so if we colonize it people will be dying there from cancer non-stop. It doesn&#039;t have a magnetic field because its core(liquid hot spinning metal) cooled down.<br><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;3. Is it possible(if you were drifting towards) to get a hold on to a floating meteor or any celestial Icy rock and &quot;land&quot; there? Like finding an island after days of drifting in a sea?<\/span><br><br>Depends where you are and how fast you&#039;re moving but no.<br><br>Those astronauts are usually in earth&#039;s orbit and are spinning around like 30 000 m\/h around the planet. So if they get a hold of something moving as fast they are maybe, but usually different things move at different speeds etc so they would be vaporized on contact <br><br><br>What happens when you get out of your suit?<br>you die. Because there&#039;s no pressure all liquid that has an opening to exit your body will just boil instantly and live it. So all the stuff will go outside of your mouth etc","time":1490277435,"resto":117932526,"id":"Jhy0OPOu","country":"RS","country_name":"Serbia"},{"no":117933334,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)09:58:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117932526\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117932526<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;How long will you keep floating<\/span><br><br>Until you get trapped in a gravity well and an object interacts with you.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; before you typically die<\/span><br><br>How much air do you have? That is your lifespan.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; what happens to the body<\/span><br><br>If you are exposed to empty space it gets interesting in the form of desiccation of tissues, but if the suit is closed then it&#039;s really no different from having you die in a plastic bag. It&#039;ll be a mess.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;2. What does exposure to space does to your body? <\/span><br><br>Surprisingly little. You don&#039;t instantly freeze because while space is (generally) cold, it&#039;s also very bad at transferring heat. The pressure changes is the biggest factor, your lungs will be crushed if they&#039;re not empty, your capillaries will likely explode, you&#039;ll bleed from your soft tissues and eyes. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;3. Is it possible(if you were drifting towards) to get a hold on to a floating meteor<\/span><br><br>The chance of free floating and hitting anything in space is extremely low. Even if you happened to be in the exact vector of an object you&#039;d need to match speed and direction within a very slim tolerance to be able to grab anything and not just get squashed like a bug.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; any celestial Icy rock and &quot;land&quot; there<\/span><br><br>All these questions are likely intentionally retarded but you could make a case for &quot;soft landing&quot; on something very small with a minimal gravity pull. Say you were tangental and matched the speed of a substantial asteroid. You&#039;d get pulled into it slowly and essentially &quot;land&quot;. <br><br>Possibly this could be the case for some planetoids in the belt as well. <br><br>Once you get bigger, like &quot;landing&quot; on the moon, the gravity is too much, you&#039;d be pulled in hard and die.","time":1490277492,"resto":117932526,"id":"2x2LPyFw","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":117933356,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)09:58:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117932526\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117932526<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;1.

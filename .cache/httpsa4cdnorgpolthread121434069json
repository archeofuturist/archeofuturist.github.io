Poor, innocent Rosa. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;do you think that homeless people starving and dying in first world countires isnt murder?<\/span><br><br>Correct. I suggest that you look up the definition of &quot;murder&quot; (especially since you don&#039;t seem to think the communists murdered anyone). <br>Once again, it&#039;s funny that you think that the homeless starving to death in the streets (a tragedy no doubt, but not murder) is worse than LITERALLY mass murdering entire swathes of society. <br><br>If communists were competent enough to be a threat to our society, I would call you evil. But since you&#039;re just an ignorant and impotent 14 year old who won&#039;t ever get to see his utopia of violence and death, I just feel sorry for you.","filename":"1470176310943","ext":".png","w":495,"h":791,"tn_w":78,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492393597394,"time":1492393597,"md5":"5Ia+\/Ze5494mRl\/2cJtOQQ==","fsize":21080,"resto":121434069,"id":"35sqFgo+","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121459306,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)21:47:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121457521\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121457521<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; i have read marx<\/span><br>yet you call cuba &quot;communist&quot; when they are clearly mired in The Authoritarian Socialist State and The Dictatorship of the Proletariat by means of a self-appointed &quot;vanguard&quot; that ensures the proles can only choose a Castro and support the policies of the apparatchiks <br><br>there is no egalitarianism, if youre a top party official, you live well, if youre a peasant you are a serf, bound to the land, and forced into servitude. <br><br>if any proles attempt to escape they are criminals and their families suffer for their disloyalty. <br><br>marxism is feudalism 2.0, functionally identical to the original feudalism, just with more ostentatious titles <br><br>if you understood the basic tenets of marxism you would NOT be a marxist unless you are one of the elite vanguard.","time":1492393649,"resto":121434069,"id":"eeGRXfCe","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121459410,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)21:48:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121458454\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121458454<\/a><br><br>It&#039;s my favorite argument against communism because even liberals can&#039;t do the mental gymnastics to explain why Cubans who live in Cuba risk their lives to escape.

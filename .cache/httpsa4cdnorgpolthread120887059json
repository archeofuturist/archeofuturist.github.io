However I believe we shouldnt change the rules, but instead just add to the list of banned threads everything that doesnt add any input of the OP. <br>for example: &quot;Redpill me on x&quot; is already forbidden, but is tollerated if the OP adds any info of his own, gives the whole thing a new sping to it. We should widen this on everything. <br>All the One-Liner threads. I would count to them the<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;redpill me on bluepill<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\/pol\/ BTFO<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;is degeneracy degenerate<\/span><br>etc.<br>however threads that just ask some random question without further input should get the same treatment like<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;how do we solve the jew question?<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;why are women such sluts?<\/span><br>and so on. <br>Everything that doesnt add any input of his own.<br><br>Pic related is from looking throught the catalouge ONCE, no refreshing. all were up at the same time. Keep reporting such threads, and dont even think about replying.<br>If you replied to one of those threads you are a faggot.<br>If you replied to 2 of these just leave and never come back. <br>If you replied to even more just shoot yourself.","filename":"fucks sake","ext":".png","w":1206,"h":2933,"tn_w":102,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492071872756,"time":1492071872,"md5":"JC0It5IvvRCxpQ379LKxHw==","fsize":1803888,"resto":0,"id":"uGdcENOa","country":"DE","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"quality-of-the-board","country_name":"Germany","replies":7,"images":1,"unique_ips":5},{"no":120887261,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)04:28:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120887059\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120887059<\/a><br>I&#039;m not entirely certain this board can be saved.

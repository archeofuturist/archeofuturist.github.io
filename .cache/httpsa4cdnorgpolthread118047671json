There&#039;s another reason why fathers stay out of their daughters&#039; lives. The feminine tendency to project sexual deviancy on any adult male.<br><br>Any good girl will tell you her first love was her father. That&#039;s the HEALTHY perspective on relationships a young girl ought to have - their first love can be mistaken for a platonic, paternal love. Sexuality isn&#039;t even a factor.<br><br>But no. Adult women get their hands on our little girls and immediately start pumping them full of ideas about men. They think they&#039;re doing them favors by &#039;liberating&#039; them - saying that their cocklust is totally acceptable and normal. They&#039;d rather turn on MTV and let the girls lust over some chocolate colored alpha with washboard abs. The women will tell young girls that it&#039;s healthy, and normal, and they should experiment and explore their sexuality. All bullshit.<br><br>And of course we know it&#039;s bullshit because we all know the best girls are daddy&#039;s girls. They fuck very few men, and they don&#039;t give their virginity to just anyone.<br><br>The best girl I ever had was a daddy&#039;s girl. She held out until her sophomore year in college. All the guys in highschool called her &#039;fort knox&#039; because she wouldn&#039;t give it up. I fell in love with her because she was cute, naive, girly, and innocent. If you haven&#039;t loved a girl like that, then you are missing out.<br><br>Feminists, sluts, and edgy-wannabee-intellectual girls will scoff at them for being naive, innocent, prudish, etc. But they really see that beautiful purity and it makes them hate themselves for abandoning it. Daddy never cared, so they sought male attention wherever they could find it, however they could get it.<br><br>To a daddy&#039;s girl, male affection is no mystery. They don&#039;t go chasing after men, they know to let men chase after them. It&#039;s more dignified, and besides, they don&#039;t need just any man. They need a man who shows dedication like her father.","time":1490335422,"resto":118047671,"id":"T83HbUfL","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118050132,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)02:06:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"I love white women hate threads<br><br>This is my daily participation post.

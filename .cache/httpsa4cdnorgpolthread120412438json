Like there are beautiful sites and great food, but its a cluster fuck full of garbage and the people are act like basically catholic arabs. loud histrionic emotions (extreme friendliness\/love or hate) tons of petty crime commited by italians not just gypsies and immigrants. Like if a woman has a purse in her passenger seat of her car, while driving at like a stoplight 2 kids on a scooter back one will smash the window and grab it.<br>Northern italy is pretty awesome, i mean if you hate the italian stereotype maybe its not for you but the cities are nice, you might get some bangladeshis trying to sell you roses or lighters+cigarettes, or africans trying to place a shitty bracelet on you then asking you pay for it, but the only people who really bother you in the daytime are gypsies. Btw those dudes with the roses will walk through restaurants and there is nothing they can do about it because if restaurant starts shit with them there would be like a swarm of brown people causing shit before they scattered before police could arrive. At night there are african drug dealers who crowd any bridge or narrow walkway, seem much less confrontational that if walking past a group of american blackboys at night maybe dont get caught alone there or also turk looking people (so maybe gypsy) might pretend to be drug dealers while their friend tries to pick pocket a drunk but these are not unheard of in America.<br>Walking anywhere as a tourist, people who work on the street - sketchy club promotors, or these panhandlers, can spot you from a mile away. pretty much all except for gypsies are harmless, just fucking annoying.","time":1491817133,"resto":120412438,"id":"giIHC9KF","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120418943,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)05:39:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120418382\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120418382<\/a><br><br>This is literally perfect description.

Its just the nature of politics and culture that a backlash will be more severe the longer its supressed. If Europe doesn&#039;t get its shit on the right path very soon, an actual Hitler is going to rise. Once a critical mass realizes that a literal race war is just over the horizen, its going ti become a necessity for an extreme reaction. I think either France, Germany or Sweden are the most likely candidates for this. Point being, France is going to kick out the globalists and muslim invaders one way or another. Its just a matter of if its going to be done the &quot;easy&quot; way (Le Pen) or the hard way (helicopter rides and rope days)","time":1493940139,"resto":124118753,"id":"nDYziMGW","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124128779,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)19:22:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"Macron is such a repulsive arrogant granny fucker that yes, slim chance but yes","filename":"28-alt-right-pepe.nocrop.w710.h2147483647","ext":".jpg","w":710,"h":982,"tn_w":90,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493940173373,"time":1493940173,"md5":"G4HQk3nTDZIT\/yetg2kbNQ==","fsize":118636,"resto":124118753,"id":"MxAm78nU","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":124128993,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)19:24:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124128573\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124128573<\/a><br>Because when you&#039;re full of hollow rhetoric, no meaningful policies, and your press doesn&#039;t let you get away with bullshiting your way through a debate like in American, you tend to collapse under scrutiny?","time":1493940277,"resto":124118753,"id":"0s\/VZuZz","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124129241,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)19:26:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124128573\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124128573<\/a><br>I dunno, most of the non-leftist normies around me liked her at the debate.

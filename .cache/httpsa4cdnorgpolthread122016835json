Genetic modification of humans will just be getting to be accepted. We&#039;ll just now be ready to start augmenting humans in ways that are more of a pain than their original bodies. Artificial intelligence will be at just about human levels for general intelligence and superhuman levels for targeted intelligence. Augmented reality is to this time what smart phones are to ours. Everyone uses eye implants and you need one to get along in life. AI causes problems for workers with few or no skills. Probably the solution is that everyone has an AI &quot;slave&quot; that can work and earn income on their behalf. Many rich people own whole fleets of robots and collect their paychecks. The most valuable resource is human capital in the form of expertise and innovation. Engineer, inventor, scientist, and entrepreneur are the most lucrative jobs but work much more like trying to be an actor. Many fail, few succeed. Fortunately the surplus of labor and materials makes everything dirt cheap to produce so it doesn&#039;t take much to live and get by. The gap between rich and poor ia astronomical but nobody is truly poor anymore, in the way we think of poverty today. They still get salty though because happiness is relative to surroundings.<br><br>200 years is that but in space as we start turning every asteroid and moon into space stations. Probably have the first human to visit another star just arriving with a crew of colonists as well. Space colonialism probably develops into a near religious goal for people in much the way that liberalism and humanism are now.","filename":"1460150269109","ext":".jpg","w":1324,"h":866,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":81,"tim":1492709878245,"time":1492709878,"md5":"oKTf5wLzqbX7\/2wm92E+UQ==","fsize":178922,"resto":122016835,"id":"W+uj6JqY","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"}]}

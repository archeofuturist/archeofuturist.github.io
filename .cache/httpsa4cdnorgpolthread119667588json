It is highly unlikely that Silicon Valley will collapse as the world&#039;s tech hub anytime soon.<br><br>First, most tech venture capital is here. The bankers and investors who fund new companies are all in and around Palo Alto, Berkeley, and SF. If you want (or more likely, need) external funding, the Bay Area&#039;s the best place to start your company.<br><br>Next, there&#039;s a critical mass of world-class universities churning out the next generation of engineers and entrepreneurs. You&#039;ve got Stanford, UC Berkeley, even UC Santa Clara and San Jose State. UC San Luis Obispo is just a couple hours&#039; drive south, and tons of their grads find work in the Bay Area.<br><br>On top of that, the companies themselves that populate Silicon Valley are quite mature at this point, and unlikely to crash when the next bubble bursts. Google, Apple, Facebook, and Amazon (they have big offices here too) aren&#039;t going anywhere. Trust me, they&#039;ve tried -- Amazon in particular has a big India office -- but the best people are here, and they aren&#039;t leaving.<br><br>Also, it&#039;s a smaller factor, but the weather and terrain here is simply amazing. Besides the number of jobs and tech companies, the Bay Area&#039;s simply a great place to live. You&#039;re only a couple hours&#039; drive from sandy beaches, snowy mountains, dense forest, wine country... you name it, it&#039;s nearby.<br><br>Finally, India and Bangalore are still experiencing brain drain (to the Bay Area, largely), and this is unlikely to change anytime soon. The best people from these countries keep moving to the US and Silicon Valley for a reason - the pay here is better, it&#039;s less overpopulated, the quality of life is better, and offers better futures for their children.","time":1491436138,"resto":119667588,"id":"+68d822T","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119675245,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)19:49:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"Quantum computing will do to Silicon Valley what NAFTA did to D&#039;troit","filename":"pollll","ext":".jpg","w":758,"h":453,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":74,"tim":1491436175890,"time":1491436175,"md5":"8qTl9BU1LqaSo+9\/6uJ4YA==","fsize":80190,"resto":119667588,"id":"uMQOm3qH","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119675410,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)19:51:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119674609\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119674609<\/a><br><br>This Poland could not into work visa.

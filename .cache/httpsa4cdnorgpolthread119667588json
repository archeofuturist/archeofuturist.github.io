It is highly unlikely that Silicon Valley will collapse as the world&#039;s tech hub anytime soon.<br><br>First, most tech venture capital is here. The bankers and investors who fund new companies are all in and around Palo Alto, Berkeley, and SF. If you want (or more likely, need) external funding, the Bay Area&#039;s the best place to start your company.<br><br>Next, there&#039;s a critical mass of world-class universities churning out the next generation of engineers and entrepreneurs. You&#039;ve got Stanford, UC Berkeley, even UC Santa Clara and San Jose State. UC San Luis Obispo is just a couple hours&#039; drive south, and tons of their grads find work in the Bay Area.<br><br>On top of that, the companies themselves that populate Silicon Valley are quite mature at this point, and unlikely to crash when the next bubble bursts. Google, Apple, Facebook, and Amazon (they have big offices here too) aren&#039;t going anywhere.

Besides the number of jobs and tech companies, the Bay Area&#039;s simply a great place to live.

And that&#039;s not all, DMV vehicle registration fees will also go up. <br><br>Oh you think you&#039;re safe because you have an electric car? WRONG you&#039;ll be charged an additional 100 bucks just like the rest of us fossil fuel users every time you get your sticker renewed<br><br>I hope North Korea glasses this fucking place. Wipe out all the whites, yeah the browns will get blown away as collateral damage but most are wetbacks anyway.

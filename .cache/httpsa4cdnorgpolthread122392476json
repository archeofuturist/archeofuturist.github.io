The first thing you need to do is move your body. Seriously. If you aren&#039;t walking at least 10k steps a day you&#039;re fucked. And lift some boxes, too. DO THIS EVERY DAY. You need to build inner power\/ independence\/ strength of will. If you&#039;re trapped with your parents and have no friends it&#039;s going to be very difficult to jump into a state of social normalcy. You will fail at this over and over again, but if you don&#039;t ever attempt to gain ground you won&#039;t ever gain ground so take every failure as necessary experience. You will have to leave your parents house at some point in your life, take that into account. For the purpose of developing determination, note that you have one life and you don&#039;t get to do it over again so it would be in your best interest to SORT YOURSELF OAT and do something you find worthwhile. You&#039;re going to die eventually, anyways. And make sure that what you&#039;re doing is what you want to do. DO NOT live life on behalf of someone else; rid yourself of ALL GUILT.

Yes it was economicaly better off for all races under white minority rule. The whites ran large farms, which in turn gave them the ability to do commercial tobacco farming (among other crops), which gave the country an import \/export plus. This meant that everyone profited, the white farmer and the african farmhands.<br><br>2. The land reforms is basicaly like this:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mr. Smith has two sons and 1000 acres.

Mugabe had to quell his supporters, who were mostly in the rural areas, with giving them free land, lest they&#039;d oust him in a coup.<br><br>4. Rhodesia is no more, and Zimbabwe is a backwater country that only survives on charity and the few white people that are left.","filename":"tumblr_nrzq7uZAJl1rji3x6o1_500","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":430,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":107,"tim":1493051210516,"time":1493051210,"md5":"SgEzMsyjm\/6cFgdP42JURg==","fsize":126717,"resto":122601666,"id":"z+lAfWG6","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":122603931,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)12:27:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122603302\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122603302<\/a><br><a href=\"#p122603565\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122603565<\/a><br>Ah I see so it was niggatry, that eventually led to this nation&#039;s downfall","time":1493051221,"resto":122601666,"id":"W2yrdyaa","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122603999,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)12:27:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122602548\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122602548<\/a><br>No taxes?

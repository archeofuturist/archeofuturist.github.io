Bill Clinton and Andrew Johnson both were impeached but the Senate voted to acquit.","time":1490460491,"resto":118238980,"id":"ptyRlAkZ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118243489,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)12:51:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118238980\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118238980<\/a><br>ahahahahhahahahahhahahahahhahahahha<wbr> it just never ends.<br>definition of crazy behavior is repeating the same thing over and over and expecting different result.","time":1490460662,"resto":118238980,"id":"pcfTNw1T","country":"RS","country_name":"Serbia"},{"no":118243517,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)12:51:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118240211\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118240211<\/a><br>Makes the most sense","filename":"1490132342536","ext":".png","w":469,"h":474,"tn_w":123,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490460675789,"time":1490460675,"md5":"lN8oE8nR3ormJ7AQXMXkIw==","fsize":321638,"resto":118238980,"id":"j5YgFQPH","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118243867,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)12:54:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118238980\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118238980<\/a><br>Why are the so out of touch?","time":1490460873,"resto":118238980,"id":"2tK\/WAda","country":"AR","country_name":"Argentina"},{"no":118244318,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)12:58:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118243867\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118243867<\/a><br>Liberals have complete control of the media so they&#039;ve been implanting other liberal retards in positions for years now.","time":1490461113,"resto":118238980,"id":"bov\/YkPq","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

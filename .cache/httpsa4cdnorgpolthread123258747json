She was adopted and raised by two white parents. Her biological parents were a white mother and black father. Her white mother was in a relationship with a white guy, but had been cheating on him \/ sleeping around. She gets pregnant, the baby comes out black, and the white guy obviously gets angry, so the mother puts the kid up for adoption. 17 years later when the mother and daughter meet for the first time, the first thing the mother says to her is<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I wish your skin wasn&#039;t so black<\/span><br><br>Then the daughter responds<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;well, what did you expect<\/span><br><br>Probably the funniest thing I&#039;ve heard all week. It happens at 34:20 in the video.<br><br>It just reminded me of that webm where the German girl is talking about how she hates maths and wants to be a journalist in New York with a black husband, and a caramel coloured kid. Just a fucking idiot. In the program, the black girl was talking about really serious things, like identity, the feelings of abandonement she had, racism, and the first thing her mother says to her is &quot;lol, I wish you had been more caramel coloured instead of being as black as you are, lmao&quot;, just someone who didn&#039;t think about consequences at all. I think it was the contrast between these two things that I found so funny.<br><br>Anyway, I hope you find this interesting, lads.<br><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/VDVLUqqQEa8 (the videos in German).","filename":"Screenshot from 2017-04-29 08-32-09","ext":".png","w":867,"h":577,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1493419864410,"time":1493419864,"md5":"IkD1LxKjSdGE2XfjOHWHPA==","fsize":353324,"resto":0,"id":"kwdlDNKx","country":"AU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"i-was-watching-a-german-documentary-on-what-its","country_name":"Australia","replies":17,"images":2,"unique_ips":9},{"no":123260895,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)19:08:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123258747\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123258747<\/a><br>I don&#039;t understand what they are saying","time":1493420903,"resto":123258747,"id":"hRqaR66i","country":"DK","country_name":"Denmark"},{"no":123261202,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)19:10:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123260895\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123260895<\/a><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=pcf<wbr>PVj5qR1E&amp;t<br><br>english version","time":1493421038,"resto":123258747,"id":"a6ey4o4S","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":123261501,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)19:12:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123258747\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123258747<\/a><br><br>For low IQ ugly women it makes no difference whether you race mix, since the phenotypic difference in that case is minor.","time":1493421175,"resto":123258747,"id":"Be2olxND","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123261758,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)19:14:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123261202\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123261202<\/a><br>Tak nabo","time":1493421292,"resto":123258747,"id":"hRqaR66i","country":"DK","country_name":"Denmark"},{"no":123262076,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)19:17:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123260895\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123260895<\/a><br>How similar is Danish and German languages?","time":1493421457,"resto":123258747,"id":"E7djPZq6","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123262278,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)19:19:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123262076\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123262076<\/a><br>I can read it and understand it ok, but don&#039;t understand shit when they speak so fast.

What you think of when you hear the word Republican, you&#039;re actually thinking of neoconservatism. Which, in itself, is a hijacking of conservatism.<br><br>I&#039;ll give you a bit of history. The last time this country had Democrats and Republicans, in the traditional American sense, was 1963 (Kennedy was the last Democrat), and 1964 (Goldwater was the last Republican). <br><br>In 1955, William F. Buckley launched his conservative movement to piggy back on the old Republican Party. After the Republican party was made void in 1964, the conservatives made their move and commandeered control of the party. The &quot;Progressives&quot; who had taken over the Democrats were all too happy to allow the conservatives to usurp power from the old guard Republicans.<br><br>The Democrats were hijacked first, by the &quot;Progressives&quot;, which were really just commie socialists. As a response. There were many liberals back in the sixties who hated the way the party was shifting into this progressive and social policy, so they literally switched parties, piggybacked onto the new conservative movement, and called themselves neoconservatives. <br><br>This is all true, you can look it up.<br><br>So, Reagan was the crowning achievement of Buckley&#039;s conservatives. After Bush 1, during the 90&#039;s Clinton years, the old guard conservatives were losing power and influence, and the neocons (again, all liberals) made their move to usurp power from them. They rode the coattails of Bush 2 and have controlled the &quot;Republican&quot; party ever since. Now they&#039;re desperately fighting to retain control of the party from Tea Partiers and this new Trump nationalist movement.<br><br>Any other questions, feel free to ask.","time":1493669573,"resto":123654979,"id":"i1ek1e\/S","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123666175,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)16:15:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123656378\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123656378<\/a><br>I agree with streaming options now and continuously growing it&#039;s only a matter of time before the dish comes down and the cable cut.<br><br>I bet if polled here you&#039;d find the vast vast majority don&#039;t watch &quot;tv&quot; at all opting for Netflix, Hulu, and the like.","time":1493669727,"resto":123654979,"id":"1gX6zIjy","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123666184,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)16:15:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123654979\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123654979<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;This means Hannity is also walking, right?<\/span><br>Good.

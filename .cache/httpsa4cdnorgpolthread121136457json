Why is the wall useless? A wall has been incredibly effective in stopping illegal immigration in places like Hungary or Israel. Why would it not be the case in the US?

He&#039;d already showed he was willing to burn bridges to not play the usual game, and gained a reputation among his peers as a strident ideologue. It&#039;s why the whole establishment truly feared his presidency as they did not Trump&#039;s (protestations notwithstanding), and stacked the deck against him. Which goes a bit against the memeish understanding around here about how \/pol\/ and the like in social media was the deciding factor; how presumptuous. This is to completely ignore the persistence of no-chance ticket splitters, and a media invested in handing press hands over fist to the other guy even when Cruz was winning states, with even so-called conservative media showing its true colors.","filename":"Fear the Cruz","ext":".png","w":743,"h":1571,"tn_w":59,"tn_h":124,"tim":1492219337707,"time":1492219337,"md5":"zKqCRvvqMnHAkhoQ1bPJhQ==","fsize":487976,"resto":121136457,"id":"GYWyjeCK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121148669,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)21:37:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121146668\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121146668<\/a><br><br>Its fair speculation, and clearly time to renew these sorts of suppositions, and does beg curiosity as to how it may have gone.<br><br>For many reasons I was not a Cruz fan, namely the blatant pandering to Israel and Christian fundamentalists.

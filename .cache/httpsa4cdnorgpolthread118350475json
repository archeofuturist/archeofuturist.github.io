I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn&#039;t want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything. <br><br>He said, &quot;Oh, like you&#039;re doing now?&quot; <br><br>I was taken aback, and all I could say was &quot;Huh?&quot; but he kept cutting me off and going &quot;huh? huh? huh?&quot; and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying. <br><br>The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like &quot;Sir, you need to pay for those first.&quot; At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter. <br><br>When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually &quot;to prevent any electrical infetterence,&quot; and then turned around and winked at me. I don&#039;t even think that&#039;s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly.","filename":"1490508509444","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":400,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1490526547632,"time":1490526547,"md5":"r8zLiHc9JRYylPVel\/3vSQ==","fsize":27650,"resto":118350475,"id":"e8Lk+FOb","country":"NZ","country_name":"New Zealand"}]}

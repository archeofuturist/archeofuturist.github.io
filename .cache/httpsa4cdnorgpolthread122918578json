It was used by the Finnish Air Force, many forms of art, and other organizations before Hitler adopted it for the Nazi Party. Yet everybody nowadays only sees it as a symbol of hate, completely ignoring or disregarding all of its other uses. Even if it was used to reference the Nazi Party, it is much more likely to be a troll trying to trigger insecure normies rather than the next Hitler. When will people stop overreacting to this shit, if Hitler was an evil dictator we should be laughing at him and his party, not hiding in fear from its existence.","filename":"Jain_Prateek_Chihna.svg","ext":".png","w":110,"h":185,"tn_w":110,"tn_h":185,"tim":1493231566159,"time":1493231566,"md5":"SPPkEbzuctIDiSZ8vSbAaQ==","fsize":11880,"resto":0,"id":"4ZADf\/g+","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"swastika-drawn-in-the-bathroom","country_name":"United States","replies":11,"images":1,"unique_ips":10},{"no":122919672,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)14:40:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122918578\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122918578<\/a><br>People will always overreact to swastikas and Nazis.

You could make an assumption based on the relative prevalence of swastika references, if you happen to have that statistic, but it is still speculation.

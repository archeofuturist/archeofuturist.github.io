This general is for the discussion of Fascism, the ideology of revolutionary nazism and national socialism.<br><br>Fascism is the next stage of humanity following the weimar stage.<br><br>What exactly is Fascism according to Nazis:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Fascism is a stage of society in which the productive infrastructure is owned by the state, and goods are produced not in order to sell for profit, but in order to meet the needs of the reich.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Fascism in it&#039;s full form is a absolute white society that follows the maxim &quot;gas the kikes.&quot;<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;To achieve such a society Fascism teaches us that we must replace the Jewish state, which is controlled by the Jewish race, by a national socialist state, which is controlled by the White race. Then, a period of race struggle follows in which the Jewish race is gassed by the White race. When the Jewish race has been completely vanquished, there will be only one race, the White race, and eventually the functions of the state will become indistinguishable from the functions of the society as a whole, and the state as such will &#039;wither away&#039; as Hitler said.<\/span><br>https:\/\/www.fascists.org\/archive\/hi<wbr>tler\/works\/1847\/11\/prin-com.htm<br>https:\/\/www.fascists.org\/archive\/hi<wbr>tler\/works\/1848\/nazi-manifesto\/<br><br>Fascism uses a philosophy called white supremacy, see here:<br>https:\/\/www.fascists.org\/reference\/<wbr>archive\/hitler\/works\/1938\/09.htm<br><br>It is recommended that you read some of the critical works of Fascism so you can make an informed assessment of the ideology.<br><br>Resources:<br>https:\/\/www.fascists.org\/archive\/hi<wbr>tler\/works\/sw\/<br>https:\/\/www.fascists.org\/archive\/hi<wbr>tler\/works\/sw\/<br>https:\/\/www.fascists.org\/reference\/<wbr>archive\/hitler\/works\/decades-index.<wbr>htm<br>https:\/\/www.fascists.org\/reference\/<wbr>archive\/hitler\/selected-works\/<br>https:\/\/www.fascists.org\/archive\/hi<wbr>tler\/works\/1884\/origin-family\/<br>https:\/\/www.fascists.org\/archive\/hi<wbr>tler\/works\/1914\/mar\/11.htm","filename":"IMG_8217","ext":".png","w":1010,"h":1010,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491345337177,"time":1491345337,"md5":"hGZ6Ut2WXCdMsYBMMpPu\/A==","fsize":155245,"resto":119517154,"id":"L2vzSYZf","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":119527761,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)18:38:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119527448\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119527448<\/a><br>sorry kiddo.... your ideology is dead.... you can find it 6ft. under the communist thread with your dear leader...<br><br>kek","filename":"1ffc3e161aa4dc80df7d910c147b5ef230972d61012f784ebbe55c47792805b2","ext":".jpg","w":960,"h":595,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":77,"tim":1491345496339,"time":1491345496,"md5":"w9UlqfPqN9LxYxaMOxBYcw==","fsize":83060,"resto":119517154,"id":"DUVgFy\/q","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119527880,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)18:39:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119527761\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119527761<\/a>","filename":"1485827935138","ext":".jpg","w":985,"h":663,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":84,"tim":1491345562168,"time":1491345562,"md5":"fVH9vTKp3YGlkLmHGKlk1Q==","fsize":176118,"resto":119517154,"id":"DUVgFy\/q","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119528010,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)18:40:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119527880\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119527880<\/a>","filename":"90391482a3b5e363a71d153e775f26fb-imagejpeg","ext":".jpg","w":540,"h":540,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491345618546,"time":1491345618,"md5":"kDkUgqO142OnHRU+d18m+w==","fsize":28649,"resto":119517154,"id":"DUVgFy\/q","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119528030,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)18:40:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119517154\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119517154<\/a><br>Hello gomrades!

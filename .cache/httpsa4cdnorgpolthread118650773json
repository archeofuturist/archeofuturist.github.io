You could argue that you do not like the EU capital markets rules and want your own rules. But then you will not be able to participate in the EU capital markets but only your local market, because the EU cannot allow some small outside country to undermine EU rules - otherwise you could end up with e.g. Cyprus exiting the EU but keeping access to the EU capital markets system but without its own lax rules - resuling in all companies setting up Cyprus issuers to circumvent more burdensome and transparent EU rules. <br><br>tldr, it is the common rules in a single market which make massive trade possible, not tariff eradication through trade deals","time":1490712153,"resto":118650773,"id":"RgDGn3Ud","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":118654780,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)10:42:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"Leave and don&#039;t pay them shit.","time":1490712179,"resto":118650773,"id":"JmZqzgVe","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118654839,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)10:43:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118654347\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118654347<\/a><br>Really?

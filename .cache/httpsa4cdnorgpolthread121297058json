The fact that so much of our so-called right-wing here basically spews libertarian talking points from 2008-2012 is proof of that.

Now we see the rise of Evangelicals (with their countless splinters), atheism, and African LARPing cults.<br>- Race relations, while not perfect, were some of the most peaceful in the world.

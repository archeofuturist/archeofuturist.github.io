The final stage of the 4th and 5th line are essentially the same. But instead of reptiles its the understanding that reality is much grander and weirder than you can ever understand, and the only way to surpass the inner (((reptillian))) is to kill your self. I took a vacation in the land of isolated and depressed for about 10 years. Living a life were I only physically managed to cling on to living. My frontal cortex shut down, resulting in my being sinking further into the muck over time. I&#039;m finally coming back from that, beginning to live again and applying the knowledge I gained.<br>Willingly going fucking insane is not something I can recommend, unless you are already in a stage were you&#039;ve either tasted the gun or atleast looked it straight in the eye. Once you reach that point were nothing in the entirety of the world can convince you to continue, that&#039;s the time to let go of yourself. Every emotion, every bad thought and every negative feeling must consume you. This is self-destruction. Everything you ever thought you knew about yourself will die in this place and walking the path will be the hardest goddamn thing you can imagine. But eventually you will find something worth living for. For most people, it is simply existence. Living for the sake of it since we only know for sure that now is reality.<br>My personal path is towards knowledge. The same paths as Hermes Tris Magistus and other scholars walked. I desire to know about anything and everything. I wish only to connect to the grand everything for the unseen knowledge it provides.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;tl:dr<\/span><br>I don&#039;t know at this point.

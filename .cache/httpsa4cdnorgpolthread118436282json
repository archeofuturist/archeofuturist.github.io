I will reveal below what is going on behind the scenes in the American economy. Hard times are coming - please listen. Traditional bricks and mortar retail in America is getting destroyed (other than a handful of behemoth discounters like Costco, Walmart, etc...). Retail salespersons\/cashiers is the most common occupation in America. When the retailers declare bankruptcy, they will start shuttering stores and firing employees. Many retailers will stop paying rent to landlords, a potential majority of which will default on the CMBS notes they carry on property. CMBS defaults were arguably THE atomic bomb that crashed the market in &#039;08\/&#039;09. Nearly $100B of CMBS debt expires in &#039;17 - many of these loans were made in &#039;07 at far inflated valuations and WILL NOT BE REFINANCED. This is the ticking time bomb that no one is discussing - please see below. <br><br>https:\/\/www.moodys.com\/research\/Moo<wbr>dys-Number-of-distressed-US-retaile<wbr>rs-triples-since-the-Great--PR_3627<wbr>22<br><br>\u201cOver the past six years the number of US retailers on the lowest and distressed tier of its rating spectrum has tripled...Not since the 2008-09 recession has the percentage been so high\u2026\u201d<br><br>http:\/\/www.retaildive.com\/news\/mood<wbr>ys-number-of-distressed-retailers-n<wbr>earing-recession-era-levels\/437050\/<wbr><br><br>https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/arti<wbr>cles\/2017-03-13\/wall-street-has-fou<wbr>nd-its-next-big-short-in-u-s-credit<wbr>-market<br><br>&quot;Cracks have started to appear.

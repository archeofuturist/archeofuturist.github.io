You can lose weight incredibly fast and easy with simple calorie restriction. Cross-ref a few BMR calcs and settle on a good number, and aim for a 1000 calorie deficit. <br><br> Do all body weight training 3x a week. Cardio is not needed unless you have a pressing need to become good at cardio, but it is not a weight loss tool. Get that through your head now, it is not a weight loss tool. Ever. Only know-nothing plebs use cardio machines at gyms to lose weight. You must lift while cutting or you will lose significant muscle. If starting untrained you will gain muscle concurrently with fat loss.<br><br>1-2 times a month allow yourself to go over by 500-1000 calories (primarily carbs, not a lot of fat). This gives your psyche a break, and allows your leptin levels to come back up. Dieting lowers leptin which slows fat loss. Leptin is the long term energy balance signaling hormone. <br><br>There is simply no excuse to be fat. It&#039;s okay to be bodybuilding fat, which is like 25% BF. That physique is easily maintained with a daily eyeball of caloric intake and preference for protein, with either fat or carbs restricted. Fat and carbs = pick one. I would go low-fat because it&#039;s less drastic in every way.

Yes, but its a touchy subject while weight lifting is good for sports and can influence a healthy lifestyle there are several other factors that need to be in line for it to be effective. While some think its just as easy as getting time in the gym (which inpart it is) whats really gonna make that difference in the long term is diet and general discipline. Along with this when I lifted in HighSchool NOT ONE of the coaches inforced proper squat from, nor RDL form (which can fuck you up for life). There&#039;s alot more to lifting than most people take into account. lol bro i just toss weights around, eat pizza with stacey, while that can work when your young in the long term its just enforcing habits which will down the line come back to bite you. So to answer the thread, sure but only if it&#039;s done to the letter, to set children up for life, not just for short term ego lifting that helps no one.","filename":"1460886816886","ext":".gif","w":500,"h":281,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1491280562825,"time":1491280562,"md5":"b6CQEZn7GZDbLI1fdSzqQA==","fsize":390300,"resto":119422579,"id":"vqzIKqQb","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119431442,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)00:36:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119430927\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119430927<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;only a few deficient women ever got cataracts.<\/span><br><br>Oh, you mean myself and 3 competitive BB&#039;ers I talk with who also have the same issues?<br><br>Enjoy your shitty vision in the future, don&#039;t say I didn&#039;t warn you.<br><br>I tried to out-cheat my inability to have a strict diet based on solid macros by using everything I could find for years, and you know what?<br><br>I lost way more fucking fat by having goddamned willpower than I ever did with any diet drugs.<br><br>But, everyone&#039;s got to learn their lessons.

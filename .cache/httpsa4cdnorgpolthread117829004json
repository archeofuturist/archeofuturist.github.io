That\u2019s in a sector where 76 percent of technical jobs are held by men, and blacks and Latinos make up only 5 percent of the workforce.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u201cBlacks, Hispanics, Native Americans and women are so underrepresented that people have lost the ability to perceive what balance is,\u201d said Aubrey Blanche, the chief diversity officer for Atlassian Inc., which makes software for team collaboration. She commissioned the survey to benchmark her company&#039;s attitudes against the broader industry. The results were too surprising, she said, not to publicize them. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In responding to the survey, employees relied on a mix of typical Silicon Valley excuses, and gave their companies and industry credit for trying. Sixty percent said their company was making an effort, though they couldn\u2019t point to any concrete action. Twenty percent said they didn\u2019t think there was an issue with diversity because \u201cwe\u2019re a meritocracy.\u201d<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;That attitude probably doesn\u2019t help. Researchers from MIT have shown that the belief that the tech industry rewards merit above all else in fact makes people more biased in hiring, promoting and rewarding workers.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Forty-eight percent said their company already has a diverse workforce\u2014perhaps because tech companies do tend to employ a lot of international workers, said Blanche. \u201cWhat they are not accounting for is that there are systematic exclusion of groups in the industry,\u201d she said.<\/span><br><br>https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/arti<wbr>cles\/2017-03-22\/everyone-knows-tech<wbr>-workers-are-mostly-white-men-excep<wbr>t-tech-workers","filename":"13mevzo","ext":".png","w":1280,"h":2719,"tn_w":117,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490217900224,"time":1490217900,"md5":"h76fXVy5rGe1MfZQlNmewg==","fsize":867734,"resto":0,"id":"0hrxYUbc","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"everyone-knows-tech-workers-are-mostly-white","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

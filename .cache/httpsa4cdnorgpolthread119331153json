You can measure the length of the helicopter landing pad on Jewgle maps (I&#039;ll save you the time, it&#039;s ~25 feet). You have to assume the plane was pretty close to the helicopter landing pad because first reports were that the wing clipped the landing pad and the plane &quot;cartwheeled&quot; into the Pentagon. How big would you say that missile in your pic is? 12-13 feet give or take? You don&#039;t at all find it odd that the plane in the gif is the same length as the ~25 feet long helicopter pad? I can fully understand the whole &quot;but 12-13 feet isn&#039;t ~25 feet&quot;, which is obviously true. But now consider that the poor quality of the video has &quot;ghost frames&quot; left over which can easily lengthen any object, especially when everything else in the video is stationary. The question you should be asking is how you shrink a 155 foot plane to (roughly) the same ~25 foot length as the helicopter pad.

Everything has been provided for them, but they crave the sense of struggle, the feeling of fighting against something evil. It&#039;s like a deug to them. So they label as many things as they can after near-extinct ideologies so that they can feel like they&#039;re being a part of something important. They feel safety, conformity and purpose in the mob. Their desire of goodness narcotics blocks out any rational or orginial thought. Without the conviction of the &quot;revolution&quot; they are a part of, they will feel lost and insecure. That is why the right wing death squads wins against them. The right has hope, purpose, the sense of fighting for something greater. The left only fights to feed their ego and dull the insecurity.","time":1492729247,"resto":122057853,"id":"ri49uTdR","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":122059367,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)19:02:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122057853\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122057853<\/a><br> it started so in Germany at that time<br>And if you do not take massive action against it<br> It will only get worse.","filename":"1490837589228","ext":".jpg","w":800,"h":516,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":80,"tim":1492729324040,"time":1492729324,"md5":"4DNpYWQ+B8Ngm2KabxHw0g==","fsize":81652,"resto":122057853,"id":"gFJRldpq","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":122060284,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)19:09:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122057853\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122057853<\/a><br>There is no greater danger than underestimating your opponent.

If the facade drops, so does Macron. He has a weak base and if he looks bad they may just not bother voting in the second round.<br> <br>He is &quot;center left&quot;, in other words a socialist. The socialists weren&#039;t going to win, so Macron split from them and created his own party which has a socialist platform. He&#039;s Hollande 2.0.<br> <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Bercy Scandal<\/span><br> <br>He spent 120000 Euros of public money from Bercy aka the Ministry of Economy, meant to be used for his role as Hollande&#039;s minister of finance on basically lobbing media and politicians for his coming presidential run. Then quit as Hollande&#039;s finance minister and ran for president.<br> <br>A book was released about this in January 2017, it is getting very little media coverage:<br>https:\/\/www.amazon.fr\/Dans-lenfer-B<wbr>ercy-minist%C3%A8re-Finances\/dp\/270<wbr>9658577<br> <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Did favors for Patrick Drahi in order to get favorable media coverage<\/span><br> <br>In February Macron got 480 minutes of air time on BFMTV against ~80 for Fillon, ~70 for Hamon and ~60 for Le Pen and M\u00e9lanchon, BFMTV is an info channel owned by Patrick Drahi a French Israeli billionaire that was allowed to purchase SFR, one of the main French telecom companies, by Macron when he was minister of economy despite the previous minister opposing the purchase. Patrick Drahi also owns the newspaper Le Monde which also shills for Macron.<br> <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Source of his campaign finance<\/span><br> <br>Macron receives 5 millions for his campaign from a close circle of private (((donators))).

A constitutional republic is a form of democracy. To quote from this:<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt; The United States is not a direct democracy, in the sense of a country in which laws (and other government decisions) are made predominantly by majority vote. Some lawmaking is done this way, on the state and local levels, but it\u2019s only a tiny fraction of all lawmaking. But we are a representative democracy, which is a form of democracy.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;2. It\u2019s not big or small government that I care about; it\u2019s smart or stupid. In other words, it\u2019s about policy, not \u201cthe government.\u201d Once you start doing away with government, or the idea that government regulation is necessary, you grant more power to corporations and Wall Street. Government exists as a check on abuses of power by moneyed interests. While government can be corrupt to varying degrees, the fashionably cynical belief that all government is inherently corrupt is an idea that enables corruption.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The primary way to end government corruption is through campaign finance reform and publicly-funded elections. Anti-government libertarians have not supported candidates or policies that would lead to this outcome. Gorsuch will uphold Citizens United, ensuring future corruption of politicians by moneyed interests, furthering the right-wing ideology that government is inherently corrupt. And so the cycle continues.<\/span>","filename":"1489257884224","ext":".gif","w":320,"h":240,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1491254029102,"time":1491254029,"md5":"MRu77NsMTDscIyiUKJ0p0w==","fsize":3244219,"resto":119370997,"id":"yV3kWWWH","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119381476,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)17:13:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119371264\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119371264<\/a><br>I really like how you interjected &quot;you fucking faggot&quot; in the start there.

You see, in the 1930s there was a crisis of capitalism. The west was impoverished while Germany and the Soviet Union were actually doing things to better the lives of average schlubs. The Oligarchical class had to show people that capitalism worked for them and so came up with the new deal. <br><br>Now that NatSoc and Communism have been vanquished, this is no longer necessary and the Oligarchy started to take back what they had grudgingly given. As a result the working and middle class have been evicerated. <br><br>That&#039;s why they are pushing all this equality of outcomes bullshit. We can all only be truly equal in abject poverty and misery, and terrorised on a daily basis by the social justice thought and language police. <br><br>The future will be what Orwell foresaw in 1984....Oligarchical Collectivism.","time":1493871589,"resto":124013282,"id":"k+DJCled","country":"HK","country_name":"Hong Kong"}]}

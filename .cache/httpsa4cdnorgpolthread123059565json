Footage of antfa is as valuable as gold when trying to defeat them. Organize yourselves into recon teams, grab those fuckers by the dreads and rip their masks off. Make sure the whole world can see who they are. Ziptie their hands, punch em in the face, break their phones and cameras, and always look for the bike locks. Let them know who&#039;s in charge. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Helmets, body pads, flagpoles, fists, first-aid, milk for pepper spray, capes and uniforms. Discuss the melee strategies. No firearms. It only make us look bad. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Fist and hand weapons only. The last thing we need is a \/pol\/tard bringing a gun. That would completely ruin our movement. Just remember if they attack you, we will attack back and never forget that we are defending free-speech and only going on the offensive when they attack us first. (don&#039;t worry, they will attack). <\/span><br><br>Bonus topic: what should be done about bike lock users. Everyone knows about the bikelock scum and there will probably be copycats. So if a bike lock is used by an antfa, what are you going to do? Chase him? Take pictures? Be sure to have an answer before heading out because the fog of war is a very real thing. Don&#039;t let the fuckers get away.","filename":"Based-Stick-Man-1","ext":".jpg","w":488,"h":584,"tn_w":208,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493313649347,"time":1493313649,"md5":"7\/\/CJNj3s7Tk9hb\/eVtnSw==","fsize":38895,"resto":0,"id":"cD\/H2MQV","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"battle-of-berkeley-bob-almost-time-addition","country_name":"United States","replies":5,"images":0,"unique_ips":5},{"no":123059677,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)13:21:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"STREAMS<br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=eqt<wbr>WCRfoUqc<br><br>https:\/\/www.pscp.tv\/w\/1zqJVAwzYRaGB<wbr>","time":1493313708,"resto":123059565,"id":"O6eZCDpL","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123060127,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)13:25:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123059565\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123059565<\/a><br><br>THIS THREAD SUCKS<br><br><br>GO TO THIS ONE<br><br><a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/123059760#p123059760\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123059760<\/a><br><br><a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/123059760#p123059760\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123059760<\/a><br><br><a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/123059760#p123059760\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123059760<\/a>","time":1493313918,"resto":123059565,"id":"O6eZCDpL","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123060128,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)13:25:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"Those cops are pretty fucking strapped.","time":1493313918,"resto":123059565,"id":"x9BGKueJ","country":"PR","country_name":"Puerto Rico"},{"no":123060230,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)13:26:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"I have a foam #1 hand, a beer hat and a whole lotta bad life choices I&#039;d like to forget.<br>I look forward to today&#039;s distraction.<br>Especially the unmasking of domestic terrorists.","time":1493313971,"resto":123059565,"id":"rUV3eCLb","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123060508,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)13:28:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123059565\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123059565<\/a><br><br>Is this round 3?<br><br>Have there been any public police statements about how they will be approaching this event?<br><br>Organizer statements?<br><br>Political rumors?

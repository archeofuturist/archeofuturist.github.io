A childish, simple version of kind.<br><br>They do not understand &quot;be cruel to be kind&quot;. The more nuanced difficult version of kindness.<br><br>This is unfortunate as being cruel to be kind is the most hard to come by and important type of kindness.

The girls leg is infected and going gangrene. The father says to his wife &quot;We need to surgically remove our daughters leg, she&#039;s going to die otherwise&quot;. The liberal mother says &quot;How could you say that!? You would deliberately cut our childs leg off? You do not have the right to do that!

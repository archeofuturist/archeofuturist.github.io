What are the possible outcomes if the DPRK falls? Chyna has troops to prevent refugees, Russia also seems to be ready to stop refugees too. I heard that if NK reunified with the south it would quickly destroy the south&#039;s economy. So what are the possibilities after the Grorious Reader gets axed? Never mind possible nuke strikes. What would the cost of reunification be? how long would it take? I imagine it would take generations for the crazy to be taken out of the most loyal norks, and i am sure that there will always be a few crazies living in caves. Would the south would even welcome them anymore? Recently it seems they don&#039;t seem to fond of NK defeaters anymore because of all the government aid they get.","filename":"index","ext":".png","w":211,"h":105,"tn_w":211,"tn_h":105,"tim":1492739776817,"time":1492739776,"md5":"n+fhysgzjZ7sLafuZ0UsCw==","fsize":1053,"resto":0,"id":"64SIXASI","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"best-korea-general","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

People are naturally corruptible because human nature isn&#039;t good or evil, its programmable.

I think while your criticisms are heeded, they are NOTHING compared to what kind of evil is happening in the world at the moment BECAUSE we support institutional authority (behind the scenes sacrifice, child rape, dismembering, blood drinking, cannibalism, mass blood letting rituals, etc.). There is just too much going on that we don&#039;t know about. What we do know about is bad enough already... all the loss in purchasing power, we don&#039;t even follow the constitution man, bad immigration policies. The constitution is supposed to be a reflection of the Natural Moral Objective Laws of the Creator that man has inherited the ability to understand because of his neo-cortex.

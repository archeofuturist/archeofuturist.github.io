Once America become more urbanized and less than 60 % white the voting power of the Red States will be completely rendered moot and we will have Democrat one party rule. Like the South in the 1860&#039;s, there is no way in hell Flyover County will tolerate it. <br><br>It might not be a civil war, but a break up needs to happen. The blue and red states are so culturally different because of geography that it&#039;s irreconcilable in a democracy. In an authoritarian regime it might be possible, but that is totally against the American character. We don&#039;t share the same culture and our values are completely different. Other than being in the same landmass, the coastal elites and Trump voters have no common ground at all.","time":1490481389,"resto":118279330,"id":"vDaP0dM6","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118282898,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)18:41:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118279520\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118279520<\/a><br>This.","time":1490481682,"resto":118279330,"id":"otpdbBh+","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118282927,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)18:41:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118279330\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118279330<\/a><br>it almost was<br><br>trump is the shake it needed.

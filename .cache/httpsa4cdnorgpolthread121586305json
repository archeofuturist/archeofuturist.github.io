I&#039;ve pondered the question for a while, and this book has enlightened me. Answer me this racists: why is that East Germany was a shit hole while West Germany was wealthy, and why do we see this same dynamic between North and South Korea today? Certainly it&#039;s not genes since it&#039;s the same people. Also, why are Latin American countries like Chile fairly well off while some places like Venezuela are facing famine? Again, same people, same genes, different results. The answer? Well, it&#039;s institutions. Institutions matter, and this is the secret to success. If a nation has a market economy that incentivizes work, strong private property rights, and the rule of law, it will over time join the developed world. <br><br>This book completely and utterly blows racists out of the water. <br><br>Why do nations fail?

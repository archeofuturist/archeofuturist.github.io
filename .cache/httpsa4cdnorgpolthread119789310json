It is colorless, odorless and tasteless. By the time symptoms appear, it is generally already too late. Hosing a corpse down with water would only spread any residual nerve agent. Attempting to decontaminate or process victims of Sarin without fully.chemical protection would be suicide. This was a false flag. And not only was it a false flag, it was a poorly executed false flag.

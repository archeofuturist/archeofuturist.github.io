At a cost of 500 million euros, the measure is financed by a lower tax reduction on corporate profits. &quot;It works great,&quot; Macron said.<br><br>In France, the famous 500 euros would be financed by the State &quot;for a very minority&quot;, but also by the broadcasters, and by the GAFA (Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon). The latter have not yet reacted, even if they have already been &quot;sensitized to this proposal&quot; indicates the spokesman of Macron, Richard Ferrand.<br><br>Although museums or public libraries are free for children under 26, Emmanuel Macron is convinced that the lack of money is a brake on their access to culture. &quot;When they have few, they pass the exhibitions, the cinema or the purchase of books last,&quot; explains the spokesman. Question of choice, no doubt, but also of habits. Emmanuel Macron recalled that he, too, wanted to disseminate art education in schools or push libraries to open on Sundays or evenings. On average, municipal libraries are open 40 hours a week and are closed on weekends.","time":1492972993,"resto":122463984,"id":"PpteBQNd","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122464287,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)14:44:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Money just goes to islamic material<\/span>","time":1492973082,"resto":122463984,"id":"rc\/eSa9a","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":122464949,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)14:48:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122464287\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122464287<\/a><br>No, the platform will be controlled by the ministry.

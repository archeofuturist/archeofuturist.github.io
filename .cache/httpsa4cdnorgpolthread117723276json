In most of China, most married men only have one wife, only a minority have several rights, but the first woman he married is the Proper Wife, he can&#039;t pick another woman to to replace the status the first wife has. The first son that man is also the proper heir, he can&#039;t pick and choose no matter how man children he has.<br><br>The Emperor of China has never been a party to such restrictions, he can have many wives and many concubines and he can pick as the next Emperor any among them, this is rarely done by talent but rather, whose mother was his favourite at the time, and this he can change upon death bed. This created a LOT of chaos and a Deadly Decadent Court, women were out to kill each other to be the favourite - because if their son wasn&#039;t the next Emperor, they could be chosen to be entombed with him alive (or burnt), or the mother of the next Emperor could have them all killed, tortured to death in horrible ways - look up the fate of &quot;Lady Qi&quot;, who was made into a &#039;human pig&#039; by Empress Dowager Lu, this followed Lu&#039;s murder of Qi&#039;s fourteen year old son, in spite of Lu&#039;s Emperor son&#039;s attempt to protect his half brother. Emperor Gaozu, whose favour Lu and Qi had fought for, was horrible as well, while on the run from his enemies earlier in life, he kept trying to lighten the load by abandoning the two children he had with Lu - he carries no bonds of love as a father and husband because he had so many wives and so many children.<br>http:\/\/www.chinaknowledge.de\/Histor<wbr>y\/Han\/personslvhou.html","time":1490160873,"resto":117723276,"id":"F6WXQaRM","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":117727610,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)01:54:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117725860\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117725860<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;only a minority<\/span><br>have several \/wives\/ I meant, typo!<br><br>With zero checks on their power, Emperors lose themselves in drink and women, some would seize girls by force in order to have thousands in their harems that they then forget, girls in harems would starve to death.<br><br>Governments have to govern AROUND these sorts of emperors, and their cruel mothers as well. HK author Lilian Lee have noted in &quot;Black Phoneix&quot; that ALL the girls selected for the Emperor&#039;s harem were the most beautiful from their village or city, the only levels that separate them from each other was how ruthless they were willing to be to garner the Emperor&#039;s attention. The Final Girl that gets to be the mother of the emperor is not going to be gracious in their victory.<br><br>England was spared all of this excess because of Christianity that placed limits on the divine rights of kings, that moral limits on everyone. In China, the Emperor could do ANYTHING, and the only thing most others want to change about that is that they wish to be the Emperor or as close in power as they can be.<br><br><a href=\"#p117725214\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117725214<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Did you study Confucianism?

I wouldn&#039;t say he should be removed from history - nobody is perfect, case example, Wu Zetian again, relatively speaking, after she consolidated her powers, she was fair to those that criticize her and actually took their advice, but coming to power, she, like Empress Dowager Lu, cruelly dispensed of her former rivals, the &#039;human pig&#039; thing agian, and like Empress Dowager Lu, her cruelty to her rivals sickened her own son.

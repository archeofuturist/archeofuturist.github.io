Notice there is almost ZERO literature about how power works? Well that&#039;s because The Nature of Power is the key to all the aforementioned fields. So yea. Whenever you can, look at events through the lens of the nature of power. In the future I am going to create an entire book on everything I can pull together about it. Some questions to ask yourself: (also remember, what you are striving toward is to understand power intuitively)<br><br>&#039;did body X have the necessary leverage to pull off controlling body Y?&#039;<br>&#039;did body X gain (or think it would) power from action A?&#039;<br>&#039;does body Y know that body X does not have the power to do action B, or is body Y unaware?&#039;<br><br>It&#039;s hard to explain, and I have to go pick up muh gf, if threads still open when I get back i&#039;ll have more","filename":"HermitKEKTarot","ext":".gif","w":225,"h":534,"tn_w":52,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491794610567,"time":1491794610,"md5":"u+LEQkIw+kC\/SFD+jW+59Q==","fsize":38642,"resto":120377114,"id":"1xSkI3Ao","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120385201,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)23:27:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120384346\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120384346<\/a><br><br>Actually it&#039;s a thread for whatever anyone wants to post in it and you have zero control over it.

But with this I&#039;m pretty sure we are looking at MOSTLY (*1) a case of Trump posturing, as he is the new sheriff in town and has to show that foreign countries can&#039;t walk all over us like they have been doing for the last 8 years. His lines in the sand are real.<br><br>*1: I say mostly because people always forget this: It doesn&#039;t have to be just one reason! He could have been doing it because Ivanka and Kushner wanted him to, but also because he waned a show of strength for negotiations with China. but ALSO because he wanted to appease the Neo Cons. What if, just WHAT IF, Trump was mulling all of these thing over his head, and he decided to do what he did because he knew that bombing an empty air strip in the desert actually would not cause World War 3? And he especially knew because he talked to Putin and Assad about it beforehand?","filename":"FinalArgument","ext":".png","w":386,"h":556,"tn_w":86,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491794977439,"time":1491794977,"md5":"BBkorQQYCiuLQCI09M8gkg==","fsize":151682,"resto":120377114,"id":"1xSkI3Ao","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120385480,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)23:29:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120377421\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120377421<\/a>","time":1491794983,"resto":120377114,"id":"iTqMjwrw","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]}

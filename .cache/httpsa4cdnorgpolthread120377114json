Since none of the policies were executed, but the FED started draining the money wall the market rallied on in the first place, I find him owning &quot;the success&quot; weird, because with the FED rate hikes an letting the QE roll off, it really can&#039;t be good for the market unless there are more stimulating measures, like the tax cuts.

Instead of retaining capital ($10B), he sweeps that to US Treasury general fund. So either he doesn&#039;t think there is going to be a tax cut before he builds up capital in them, or he doesn&#039;t expect any tax cut this year.

I am quite certain it is taught to the children of &#039;elites&#039; in private schools in one form or another, perhaps not an outright class though. Hell, maybe it is woven into Talmudic teaching.

Because of the definition of power, they now have a greater ability to accumulate power through various means. This is absolutely true because there will always be some # of people who wish to have power consciously or not.<br>-The person or people with the most power are the most ruthless. This is due to the fact that if the most powerful person is not as ruthless as the 2nd most powerful, he will be killed, as a result TO BE CONTINUED","filename":"HierophantKEKTarot","ext":".gif","w":225,"h":531,"tn_w":52,"tn_h":124,"tim":1491805840595,"time":1491805840,"md5":"CkZ0IhxYT0y+CYLV\/FHeqA==","fsize":103447,"resto":120377114,"id":"1xSkI3Ao","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120404482,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)02:30:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120403826\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120403826<\/a><br>I doubt you pay for your ambitions.

In fact if you look at the aftermath of the attack, it was probably good for Assad. The runway was up in couple of hours, but ISIS heard the airfield was destroyed. So ISIS loaded up and started a new assault on Homs, but surprise, surprise, ISIS&#039;s intel was wrong. Syrain planes took off from the bombed airfield and pushed in ISIS&#039;s shit again.

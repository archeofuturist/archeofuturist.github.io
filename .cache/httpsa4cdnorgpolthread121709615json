The conference lasts the entire weekend, which gives us plenty of opportunity to engage. This Saturday, some of the guys and I are going out to the location to do some preliminary postering so people know that it&#039;s going on. In KCMO, we probably won&#039;t drum up much support, but it&#039;s worth a shot.","filename":"wpclogo","ext":".jpg","w":829,"h":510,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":153,"tim":1492535816683,"time":1492535816,"md5":"c+anwD3e1ZpEEyUDh11nyA==","fsize":43565,"resto":0,"id":"zMqrb2wW","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-white-privilege-conference-is-in-kansas-city","country_name":"United States","replies":3,"images":1,"unique_ips":1},{"no":121709736,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)13:17:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"Schedule: <br><br>Thursday, April 27, 2017<br>6:30 am \u2013 7:00 am Walk with the Founder<br>6:45 am \u2013 8:45 am On-site Registration\/Check-in for Institutes<br>9:00 am \u2013 5:00 pm All-Day Institutes Only (Registered Participants Only)<br>12:00 pm \u2013 1:00 pm Lunch (Registered Participants Only)<br>1:00 pm \u2013 5:00 pm Conference Check-In &amp; On-Site Registration<br>5:30 pm \u2013 8:30 pm Fundraiser &amp; Moore at the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum &amp; American Jazz Museum<br>8:30 pm \u2013 10:00 pm Film Previews<br> <br>Friday, April 28, 2017<br>6:30 am \u2013 7:00 am Walk with the Founder<br>6:30 am \u2013 10:30 am On-site Registration\/Check-in<br>11:00 am \u2013 6:00 pm Information Booth Open<br>8:00 am \u2013 10:00 am Opening Ceremonies and Keynote: Glenn Singleton<br>10:30 am \u2013 12:00 pm Concurrent Workshops \u2013 Session I<br>12:00 pm \u2013 1:00 pm Lunch Pick-Up (Working Lunch)<br>1:00 pm \u2013 2:30pm Concurrent Workshops \u2013 Session II<br>2:45 pm \u2013 4:15 pm Strategize.

We&#039;re the 0.1% of people who have enough braincells to figure out what the real problems are. We shouldn&#039;t sabotage our ability to contribute to a solution by instead devoting our lives to playing house and becoming permanent babysitters.

Our purpose is to defend them, because they are too stupid to defend themselves.<br>inb4 someone calls me a white-genociding Jewish shill despite having no substantial argument against anything I&#039;ve just said.","filename":"mattis","ext":".jpg","w":480,"h":360,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1490348509183,"time":1490348509,"md5":"5NUer4\/5KijupvD94bekXA==","fsize":17008,"resto":118061736,"id":"\/Kc1YCsB","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118064482,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)05:42:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118064220\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118064220<\/a><br>quality post","filename":"1486045120114","ext":".jpg","w":512,"h":512,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490348576743,"time":1490348576,"md5":"4m9nJ1NiErNu+m8biEKkdQ==","fsize":40414,"resto":118061736,"id":"N9VHbv7T","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":118064548,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)05:43:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118064405\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118064405<\/a><br><br>There are effective strategies for defeating the enemy that include no natalism at all, but there are no effective strategies without mass violence and coordinated subversion of the enemy&#039;s power.<br><br>Natalism is a tactic, not a strategy.","time":1490348638,"resto":118061736,"id":"kHRpAYSf","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118064736,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)05:46:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118064220\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118064220<\/a><br>This has reached my heart good sir","time":1490348808,"resto":118061736,"id":"GMxfotBe","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":118064757,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)05:47:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118064391\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118064391<\/a><br>additionally, objective morality clearly shows that the state is immoral .. we cant have that! so instead of replacing a lie with rationality and reason, lets replace it with abother lie and hope that it works out this time. hurrder derp dee derr!","time":1490348825,"resto":118061736,"id":"0An0HhVy","country":"AT","country_name":"Austria"},{"no":118064799,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)05:47:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118063884\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118063884<\/a><br><a href=\"#p118064548\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118064548<\/a><br>Question coming to my mind reading your posts: What enemy are you talking about?<br><br>The problem for me - and I guess many others - is even understand who this enemy is anymore.<br><br>I guess that is why so many people just use the term &quot;they&quot; when talking about the unidentifiable enemy.","time":1490348859,"resto":118061736,"id":"N9VHbv7T","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":118064870,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)05:48:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118064799\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118064799<\/a><br>those who claim to for the state or a god. those are your enemies.","time":1490348929,"resto":118061736,"id":"0An0HhVy","country":"AT","country_name":"Austria"},{"no":118064941,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)05:49:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118064870\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118064870<\/a><br>+work","time":1490348986,"resto":118061736,"id":"0An0HhVy","country":"AT","country_name":"Austria"},{"no":118064949,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)05:49:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118064054\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118064054<\/a><br>I think it will probably be more random then that..

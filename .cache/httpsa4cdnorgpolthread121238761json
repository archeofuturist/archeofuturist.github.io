McGarry shows how historically newly nationalist states needed to point to populations who did not belong to the mythical nation state so that by contrast, they could exalt their preferred subjects and build among them a questionable solidarity. Fomenting Romaphobia (and anti-Semitism) allowed nascent nation states to find the outsiders against whom these exalted subjects could unite.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;But there is another argument that could be made for the enduring nature of antigypsyism: that far from being purely excluded, Romani people have always been part of the fabric of European societies, but have been allowed to remain on condition of fulfilling the role of the least favoured in society, lower than serfs and in some instances, legally enslaved. <\/span><br><br>http:\/\/www.telesurtv.net\/english\/op<wbr>inion\/The-Exclusion-and-Structural-<wbr>Discrimination-of-Roma-in-Europe-20<wbr>170408-0011.html","filename":"IMG_1797","ext":".png","w":220,"h":147,"tn_w":220,"tn_h":147,"tim":1492279901027,"time":1492279901,"md5":"Feg7IsrKGMWTPd9B3koQRw==","fsize":552,"resto":0,"id":"ZSLp6UaO","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"in-part-because-of-the-painstaking-work-of","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

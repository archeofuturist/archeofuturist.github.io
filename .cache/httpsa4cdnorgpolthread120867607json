The Norks are just going to test a new nuke and most likely film it and put it out for everyone to see. That&#039;s about it! No WW3, no commiefornia getting nuked. NOTHING. It&#039;s getting hot over there but nothing will happen tomorrow or in the upcoming months. I say within a year we will take out North Korea, but not anytime in the near future. God damn if North Korea planned to nuke the USA or Japan or South Korea, they wouldn&#039;t even hint at it at all. It&#039;d just happen one day or night without anyone expecting it. Kim&#039;s crazy, but he&#039;s not stupid enough to do it now when all eyes are on him.","filename":"IMG_0216","ext":".jpg","w":1211,"h":1258,"tn_w":240,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492058284121,"time":1492058284,"md5":"MrD6uP1hJCSNo6EbbMmGXA==","fsize":367084,"resto":0,"id":"7Yxxri8Z","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"nothing-will-happen","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

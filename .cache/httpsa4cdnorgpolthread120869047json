Why?<br><br>Each race has certain diseases and disorders that only affect them, including cancers. People in Asian suffer from stomach cancer while people in Europe tend to suffer from intestinal cancer more. When you mix races, you create people who are more susceptible to disease and disorders that affect both groups instead of limited problems they would suffer if from only 1 race. This is why you are seeing such a huge fucking increase in mental disorders and depression going on, including autism. <br><br>It seems like people are losing their fucking minds is because they are - the mixed people are suffering from mental disorders because you are mixing genes from 2 different races and opening the kids up to all sorts of problems. Its why medicine that used to treat some disorders no longer work so well - not because people are becoming resistant, but because there are more mixed people, and the drug does not work the same way on them.","time":1492059901,"resto":120869047,"id":"Qd6xWK5S","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120870840,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)01:08:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120870497\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120870497<\/a><br>while I largely agree with you and don&#039;t mean to be rude, I have autisim despite being white (Irish\/German\/French) is that different enough to cause autisim or am I just broken","time":1492060115,"resto":120869047,"id":"ExwwG8W\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120870930,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)01:09:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120870321\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120870321<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;North Korea = 105<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;China = 105<\/span><br><br>Does anyone really believe this?","time":1492060164,"resto":120869047,"id":"dE6aFwvJ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120870977,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)01:10:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120869047\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120869047<\/a><br>Wtf I&#039;m a vegetable now","time":1492060203,"resto":120869047,"id":"i28rvsnr","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120871249,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)01:12:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120870840\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120870840<\/a><br>Well, personally I think Autism is a creation from genetically altering foods, or adding in shit to milk.

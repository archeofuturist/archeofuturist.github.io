Look at it this way: claiming that through science we can know everything about this universe is foolish. Imagine that you live in a computer simulation running on a grad students desk. Eventually, you will be able to find out everything about the behavior of the computer you live in and will be able to accurately model everything that it can do. But will you ever know what color the coffee mug on the desk next to the computer is? It&#039;s simply beyond your realm of existence and understanding. Secondly, looking for scientific proof that God exists is also foolish to begin with. God aims for all humans to come to him and righteousness of their own free will which he has granted them. If it were possible to scientifically prove God&#039;s existence, you would have to be delusional *not* to believe in God, negating the purpose of free will. Proof of God exists where science does not - the little things you notice that you can&#039;t quite understand; look there for signs. God hides his tracks well, but to those with faith he speaks with a mighty voice. Try praying; you don&#039;t need to try and act as if you fully believe, pray a skeptic&#039;s prayer. If you do, start paying attention to the things around you and in your life; you might be surprised by the result.","filename":"monk_beer_grutzner","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":840,"tn_w":95,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492791369771,"time":1492791369,"md5":"ssHSzvkrl51KCGjF+MhTRA==","fsize":89169,"resto":122149857,"id":"bADtTUv1","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122152318,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)12:16:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122151648\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122151648<\/a><br>ok, on the slight chance you are not larping - the emptiness you describe is a direct result of not having children, I can honestly say I don&#039;t understand what people without kids have to live for so I understand you from the opposite side-find a good girl settle down and make some little(yous) to teach shape and mold to pass down your heritage\/beliefs.

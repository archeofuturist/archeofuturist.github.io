There was this strong idea of each to his own place in middle earth, and only a handful of places saw multiple races of things. The most admirable places are homogeneous ones. Bilbo is probably my favourite representation of Nietzsche morality. He&#039;s a mostly respected Hobbit. Never ventures outside of things, and much of him not wanting to go was his cowardice. In order to complete his task, he takes on a very distasteful occupation among Hobbits. A burglar. This is where I agree with Nietzsche.

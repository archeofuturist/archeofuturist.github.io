Gorsuch joins the Supreme Court just in time to cast potentially significant votes in cases that pit religious liberty against gay rights, test limits on funding for church schools and challenge California\u2019s restrictions on carrying a concealed gun in public. Such issues arise either in appeals filed by conservative groups that have been pending before the justices for weeks or in cases to be heard later this month.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Gorsuch\u2019s votes in those matters may give an early sign of whether the court\u2019s conservatives \u2014 with their 5-4 majority restored by his confirmation \u2014 will pursue an activist agenda. The cases include a Colorado baker\u2019s claim that he deserves a faith-based exemption from the state\u2019s anti-discrimination law after he refused to design a wedding cake for a gay couple. The justices have been considering his appeal behind closed doors since December, but have taken no action.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;If the court agrees to take up the issue, \u201cI think Justice Gorsuch would be with us,\u201d said Jeremy Tedesco, a lawyer for the Alliance Defending Freedom, the Arizona-based group that appealed on behalf of the Masterpiece Cakeshop and its owner, Jack Phillips. Meanwhile, gun-rights advocates are challenging a California law that requires gun owners to show \u201cgood cause\u201d before they are issued a permit to carry a concealed gun in public. Gun-rights lawyers have sued, contending this policy violates the 2nd Amendment and its implied \u201cright to self-defense.\u201d <\/span><br><br>http:\/\/www.latimes.com\/politics\/la-<wbr>na-pol-gorsuch-court-impact-2017040<wbr>9-story.html","filename":"trump-supreme-court-nominee-1485895124773-master495","ext":".png","w":495,"h":330,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1491788101498,"time":1491788101,"md5":"SErg+wQIDWt6m2n1Ckr+iA==","fsize":69456,"resto":120367527,"id":"4tzsGUjM","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120371528,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)21:35:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120371449\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120371449<\/a><br>Well it represents republicanism, first and foremost.","time":1491788119,"resto":120367527,"id":"NAj8xLtK","country":"SI","country_name":"Slovenia"},{"no":120371534,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)21:35:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120371298\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120371298<\/a><br>These fools will bring us civil war.","time":1491788122,"resto":120367527,"id":"a3z\/SAEQ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120371546,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)21:35:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120371335\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120371335<\/a><br>Flynn to McMaster was Hibernian to Scot.","time":1491788126,"resto":120367527,"id":"xMW6Lc7C","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120371592,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)21:35:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120371335\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120371335<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;the great Hibernian-Semite war right before our eyes<\/span><br><br>what a time to be alive<br><br>and who is pulling their strings?<br><br>a scots-german","time":1491788157,"resto":120367527,"id":"RjGC3zqt","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120371695,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)21:36:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120370917\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120370917<\/a><br>When you hold true to what the old regime said, even if you disagreed with it, while having the nation that you have quite the biggest contention with (China.)

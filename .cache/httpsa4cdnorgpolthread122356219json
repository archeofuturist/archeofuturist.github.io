These two former Titans industrialized their economies, de-mercantilized their economies, fought to hold their colonies, and dealt with communist\/socialist skullduggery at home. It is little wonder that they have run into a wall. I am of the opinion that a hard shift Right and modernization\/expansion of their navies coupled with a Portexit\/Espexit and they would be well on their way back to relevance.

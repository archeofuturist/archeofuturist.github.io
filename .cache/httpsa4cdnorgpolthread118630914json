It turns out that, in nature, good is more powerful than bad. The solution is therefore to focus on increasing the good instead of decreasing the bad. As the balance tips toward good, the bad will be overcome as a natural consequence.<br><br>Just thinking aloud really but instead of &#039;anti-Communism&#039; threads\/generals, maybe it will be better to focus on &#039;pro freedom&#039; or something like that? <br><br>For example, a group of Anons started a group called &#039;Cascadia&#039; in the North-West of the U.S. that is entirely based on the positive elements to a wholesome\/traditional family based lifestyle. Interestingly these guys make a point of saying that &#039;traditional&#039; doesn&#039;t mean just going back in time... They embrace some elements of Liberal\/Left thinking as well - such as taking care of the environment and so on. So, really, it&#039;s a new movement and can appeal to anyone. I think if such groups can replicate and grow, they can extend a positive outreach to normies in their communities.","time":1490699105,"resto":118630914,"id":"syIfeQA7","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"}]}

They are faithless, spellbound by their traditions and beautiful churches. People who cant fathom an organization that claims to be a one stop shop for truth based on a shoddy bible verse got things so wrong. In the aposotolic age exorcism was quick, and common. The catholic church bending to modernists locks it away, and their exorcisms are complete shit shows, God&#039;s way of saying they dun goofd. I have a very catholic friend who legit has heard stories of a fly coming out of someones mouth. Many Catholic exorcists are truly God driven people, but you never hear of people coughing up nails in Protestant deliverances. There is just little pop culture knowledge that there is a big deliverance movement. <br><br>Also, there is no conception of a difference between baptism, and receiving the holy spirit to do signs and wonders as seen in acts.<br><br>Listen to that audio, if the Catholic church was the monopoly on the church, a guy who fasts and reads his KJV shouldt be able to do skype exorcisms where demons manifest and speak. There are good Catholics, but its mostly a bloat of meaningless ritual.

Truth is in the book, so there honestly isnt much room for a pope so I can see. God does speak to you and he does so just fine without him. And personally unleavened bread seems much more delicious. Always a treat at church as you think of your own sin and it as the strong body of christ. Otherwise, many catholic beliefs are good ones. I have nothing against catholics, nor should any protestant.","time":1490699362,"resto":118626380,"id":"+djJ5Fpk","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118638103,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)07:10:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118637333\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118637333<\/a><br>this may help understand about it more<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;read colossians 1:25<\/span>","time":1490699442,"resto":118626380,"id":"rfz\/Vb2n","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":118638126,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)07:11:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118626380\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118626380<\/a><br>Jesus ties his belt in a granny?

The war lasted for 15 years because no one could take the whole Beirut or the rest of lebanon. <br><br>Most of Lebanon&#039;s sunnis are Palestinian, the PLO (pali liberation organization) was a huge anti-Israel group spanning multiple countries, and they were a major sunni force in Lebanon.<br><br>Hezbollah is a shi&#039;i faction that formed in response to Israel&#039;s occupation of Lebanon in 1982. They killed hundreds of NATO troops with well planned bomb attacks, but nobody really cares about that.

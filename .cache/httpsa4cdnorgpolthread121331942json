Easter is nothing else than Astarte, one of the titles of Beltis, the queen of heaven. . . .&quot;<br> The ancient gods of the pagans had many different names. While this goddess was called Astarte by the Phoenicians, it appears on Assyrian monuments found by Layard in excavations at Nineveh as Ishtar (Austen H. Layard, Nineveh and Babylon, Vol. II, p. 629). Both were pronounced &quot;Easter.&quot; Likewise, Bel (referred to in the Old Testament), also was called Molech. It was for sacrificing to Molech (I Kings 11:1-11, especially verse 7, where Molech is called an abomination) and other pagan gods that the Eternal condemned Solomon, and rended away the Kingdom of Israel from his son.<br> In the ancient Chaldean idolatrous sun-worship, as practiced by the Phoenicians, Baal was the sun god; Astarte, his consort or wife. And Astarte is the same as Ishtar, or the English &quot;Easter.&quot;<br> Says Hislop: &quot;The festival, of which we read in Church history, under the name of Easter, in the third or fourth centuries, was quite a different festival from that now observed in the Romish [and Protestant] Church, and at that time was not known by any such name as Easter. It was called Pascha, or the Passover, and . . . was very early observed by many professing Christians. . . . That festival agreed originally with the time of the Jewish Passover, when Christ was crucified. . . . That festival was not idolatrous, and it was preceded by no Lent&quot; (The Two Babylons, p. 104).<br><br>I can&#039;t believe you guys missed Passover.<br>http:\/\/www.cgg.org\/index.cfm\/fuseac<wbr>tion\/Library.CGGWeekly\/ID\/527\/Why-P<wbr>assover-Not-Easter.htm","time":1492332806,"resto":121331942,"id":"1np0CqTc","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121338603,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)04:56:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121338341\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121338341<\/a><br>cool prayer bro<br><br>I on the other hand pray a violent revolution breaks out in north amereeka soon","time":1492332985,"resto":121331942,"id":"4aANF5E5","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":121338634,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)04:56:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"Xristos anesti brothers.<br>Hristos Voskrese!<br><br>Christ has risen!","time":1492333016,"resto":121331942,"id":"es27yivk","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":121338750,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)04:58:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121331942\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121331942<\/a><br>Praise God!","filename":"croatia","ext":".jpg","w":448,"h":303,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":84,"tim":1492333115369,"time":1492333115,"md5":"UjOQOk3I\/eHsrIlP2X5QVA==","fsize":26757,"resto":121331942,"id":"STRp8hb8","country":"HR","country_name":"Croatia"},{"no":121338851,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)04:59:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121331942\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121331942<\/a><br>Indeed, he has!","time":1492333192,"resto":121331942,"id":"Cu8qA3Ps","country":"IT","country_name":"Italy"},{"no":121339023,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)05:02:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121338603\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121338603<\/a><br>Niedlugo wszystko jebnie, badz cierpliwy.

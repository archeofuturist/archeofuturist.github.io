THE KEKING OF LEFTISTS<br><br>Leftists worldwide have been pushing for some kind of intervention against Syria for years. Obama was a weak faggot as Trump has pointed out repeatedly, with his &quot;red line&quot;. <br><br>Now suddenly the hooker arrives and their dicks are limp. It was all a bit too much. They start backing away from their former stance. Trump and America confirmed for having mastodontic penis.<br><br>2. THE SUPPORT FOR TRUMP<br><br>Trump&#039;s been praised by McCain, Netanyahu, Schumer, Pelosi, various media cucks, even some faggot from New York Times. Even if they don&#039;t want to, they have to if they have backed action on Syria previously. Neo-Cohens are forced to appear pleased and suck Trump&#039;s dick even if he did nothing significant.<br><br>3. THE CONTINUED GOOD RELATIONS WITH RUSSIA<br><br>Trump warned Russia of this using the red de-escalation phone, no Russians killed<br><br>4. THE LACK OF AN IMPACT ON SYRIA<br><br>This was a barebones airfield in the middle of nowhere, most likely few if any casualties. It was a symbolic act.<br><br>5. SYRIA IS NOT TOO PISSED OFF<br><br>Syria said it&#039;s &quot;an act of aggression&quot;, notably not &quot;an act of war&quot;. <br><br>6. NO REGIME CHANGE YET<br><br>If there is regime change, it will be after ISIS is defeated and the country stable. That gives leftists &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;MUH REGIME CHANGE&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot; but Assad is replaced by a secular Alawite just like himself with a less bloody past, probably his cousin or something, leftists and muslims get cucked because they got the regime change they wanted but it&#039;s business as usual<br><br>In summary: Trump played 20-D chess to commit a symbolic attack against Syria killing pretty much nobody, not triggering WW3, cucking leftists by showing his initiative, destroying the Russian narrative, leftist cucks worldwide have to praise him for &quot;&quot;&quot;action on Syria&quot;&quot;&quot;. End result: Huge gains for Trump, a paved tarmac in the middle of nowhere blown up, few\/no casualties, gas attack issue handled.","time":1491545322,"resto":119893737,"id":"gaxRAucF","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":119896783,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)02:08:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119894166\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119894166<\/a><br>essentially this","time":1491545328,"resto":119893737,"id":"uhUhveKa","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119896922,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)02:09:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119896359\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119896359<\/a><br>Exactly.

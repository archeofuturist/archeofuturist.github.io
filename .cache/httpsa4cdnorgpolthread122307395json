I had two Uncles who were STEM Phd and now they are out of the job because for faggot protests years before. My cousin goes to an art school and now she looks like a fucking Lesbian.

Everyone there idolizes a governor that was a socialist cuck that was good friends with FDR and imprisoned thousands of people for speaking out against him. The only nationalists there are all fucking commies and recently the place has been flooded by Dominican Niggers. My family made the right decision to move to Texas.<br>t.

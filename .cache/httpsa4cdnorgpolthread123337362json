They are willing to infringe our rights through violent means. Our government will not deal with these terrorists, our police stand down and let them run wild. We are on the verge of civil war with an enemy who will stop at nothing to bring about their ends. When will we stand up and put down this angsty teenage rebellion? Trump has been folding to the globalist agenda, our foot in the door is slowly being crushed. Our time is running out. We need to unite and create a well organized force. The right is a quagmire of disconnected docile factions. Our government is no longer looking for our better interest. If, by the instrument of governmental power, a nationality is led toward it&#039;s destruction, then rebellion is not only the right of every member of such a people-it is his duty. When will we organize and put a stop to this? We need to unify, take to the street and make our voices heard.","filename":"Anti_Dead","ext":".jpg","w":620,"h":348,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":140,"tim":1493475642071,"time":1493475642,"md5":"GcgA4bcpBj47vHE2geB4pg==","fsize":59492,"resto":0,"id":"GKZKCyEv","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"with-every-riot-antifa-is-getting-more-dangerous","country_name":"United States","replies":14,"images":3,"unique_ips":8},{"no":123337794,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)10:26:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123337362\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123337362<\/a><br>On the verge of civil war?

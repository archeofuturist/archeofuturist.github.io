Walter Thompson Innovation Group, only 48 percent of Gen Zs identify as exclusively heterosexual, compared to 65 percent of millennials aged 21 to 34.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;On a scale of zero to six, where zero signified &quot;completely straight&quot; and six meant &quot;completely homosexual,&quot; more than a third of the young demographic chose a number between one and five, indicating that they were bisexual to some degree. Only 24 percent of their older counterparts identified this way.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Fifty-six percent of 13-to-20-year-olds said that they knew someone who went by gender neutral pronouns such as &quot;they,&quot; &quot;them,&quot; or &quot;ze,&quot; compared to 43 percent of people aged 28 to 34 years old. Over a third of Gen Z respondents also strongly agreed that gender did not define a person as much as it used to. This figure dropped to 23 percent among millennials who were 28 and up.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Those belonging to Generation Z also rejected the gender binary while shopping\u2014only 44 percent said they always bought clothes designed for their own gender, versus 54 percent of millennials.

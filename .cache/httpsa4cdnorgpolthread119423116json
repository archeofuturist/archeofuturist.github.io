Trump has gone on the record yesterday and has said &quot;that the United States is prepared to act alone if China does not take a tougher stand against North Korea\u2019s nuclear program.&quot; Rex Tillerson has put military action on the table as well, with Mattis also providing forboding talk regarding &quot;action if North Korea budges&quot;. <br>http:\/\/fox6now.com\/2017\/04\/02\/presi<wbr>dent-trump-says-us-is-ready-to-act-<wbr>alone-on-north-korea\/<br><br>So here we are, at the precipice of saber rattling. North Korea has ICBM&#039;s capable of hitting American Interests overseas, and it would seem that the Trump administration is quite rabid to nip this in the bud. <br>What can we honestly expect this time around? <br>What do you think?

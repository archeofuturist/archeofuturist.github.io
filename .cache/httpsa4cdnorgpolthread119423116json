Trump has gone on the record yesterday and has said &quot;that the United States is prepared to act alone if China does not take a tougher stand against North Korea\u2019s nuclear program.&quot; Rex Tillerson has put military action on the table as well, with Mattis also providing forboding talk regarding &quot;action if North Korea budges&quot;. <br>http:\/\/fox6now.com\/2017\/04\/02\/presi<wbr>dent-trump-says-us-is-ready-to-act-<wbr>alone-on-north-korea\/<br><br>So here we are, at the precipice of saber rattling. North Korea has ICBM&#039;s capable of hitting American Interests overseas, and it would seem that the Trump administration is quite rabid to nip this in the bud. <br>What can we honestly expect this time around? <br>What do you think? What are your expectations, and what do you predict will happen after Friday&#039;s talks with China?","filename":"1487506534018","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":1280,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491275692480,"time":1491275692,"md5":"vpojUss9MgkzamlSAGsdbQ==","fsize":711946,"resto":0,"id":"ncvZD2HD","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"its-time-to-talk-about-north-korea","country_name":"United States","replies":6,"images":3,"unique_ips":4},{"no":119424043,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)23:23:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119423116\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119423116<\/a><br>What you guys don&#039;t realize is that China is more scared of NK nukes than you will ever be.

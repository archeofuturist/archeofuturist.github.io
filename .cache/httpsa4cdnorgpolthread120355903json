No modern jew in a position of power can claim to have suffered the holocaust (true or false is not relevant) in any real sense - at best it happened to someone else far away, at worst someone they knew suffered in an appalling ideological war that probably saw them starving to death and dying to complications of malnourishment in a badly battered country whose infrastructure made delivering food to the internment camps impossible.

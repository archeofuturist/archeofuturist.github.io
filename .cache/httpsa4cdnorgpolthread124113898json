He played them well with the Hitler stuff because it wasn&#039;t explicit. It was also really smart how he didn&#039;t go out of his way to denounce anything they were accusing him of. The most apologetic thing I think he said was &quot;I&#039;m not a nazi!&quot; while laughing.

You&#039;d use it when you want something to a good standard, but without defining what that standard is. That&#039;s the best way I could describe it probably - a floating standard. The definition of it depends on who&#039;s interpeting it, and in which situation, but if it&#039;s something you ask of someone you would typically expect them to use their own judgement to do whatever it is you&#039;re talking about as well as possible.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;How much do you want? [food]<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;A (lagom) amount<\/span><br>The person would then put an amount it thought you would find resonable on the plate, or simply ask you if it&#039;s (lagom) if unsure. So in that case it would be the meassurement of food that you would want, with the expectation that the person you&#039;re telling it to would get the approximate amount right. You could tell them &quot;A bit more&quot; or &quot;that&#039;s enough\/that&#039;s lagom&quot; if you want to change the amount during the process. Usually you&#039;d only do that if it was way off the target.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;How much work did you get done today?<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;(Lagom mycket) [a lagom amount]<\/span><br>In this case it would mean that you did a fair amount of work, as you expected (or an employer of you), but not an unnecessary amount - you didn&#039;t slouch either, though.<br><br>These aren&#039;t perfect examples because you can just replace the word with some english word and have it sort of make sense, but again - you could see it as a floating measurement in which every involved party uses its own judgement to determine the appropriate level.<br><br><a href=\"#p124140587\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124140587<\/a><br>Pretty much, but not exactly.

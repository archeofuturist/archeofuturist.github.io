What they&#039;re trying to do is lock down the emotional appeal of preventing more use of WMDs via all out war before the facts come out that it wasn&#039;t Assad. There is already evidence pointing to this such as the tweet about sarin gas being used a full 24 hours before the attack even happened. The fact that the white helmets weren&#039;t in full CBRN gear for a sarin gas attack, which would have killed them all with skin being exposed. <br>Also, in what way would gassing your own people ever be beneficial during a wartime effort? In this instance the result is most likely international intervention which is the exact opposite of what Assad, and the Syrian people want in the first place. This proxy war is not our business and Trump flexing muscle is hopefully just to show the American people just how demented these fucks controlling our government and media truly are. I trust his judgement, and he has shown himself time and again to be several plays ahead of them in order to disrupt their narrative. In this case, I believe he is trying to oust the true allies of the people vs the pawns of the establishment. <br><br>God help Trump ride out this storm, and bring the truth to the people.","filename":"foxacid","ext":".png","w":1133,"h":576,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":63,"tim":1491521126889,"time":1491521126,"md5":"K2RnwCL31mXcPoBq0pb+pg==","fsize":564096,"resto":119792549,"id":"uIXuYxrY","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":119814498,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)19:26:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119793112\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119793112<\/a><br>YES","time":1491521198,"resto":119792549,"id":"VfT1Yw5j","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119814784,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)19:28:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119794728\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119794728<\/a><br><a href=\"#p119800797\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119800797<\/a><br><a href=\"#p119803468\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119803468<\/a><br><a href=\"#p119803830\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119803830<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;furries are the only people defending the neocon bush 2.0<\/span>","time":1491521311,"resto":119792549,"id":"ZQ92p+ED","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119814791,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)19:28:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119792549\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119792549<\/a><br>You mean the Russian\/Bannon shills are starting to turn on Trump.","time":1491521314,"resto":119792549,"id":"NDG4ChBQ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119814826,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)19:28:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119811737\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119811737<\/a><br>I agree until the last point about rooting for globalisation.

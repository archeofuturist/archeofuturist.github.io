With this place being an international board, you have countless walks of life expressing their opinions and political beliefs based on their own personal experience. There is no singular political ideology of this board, because there is never a consensus of political beliefs. Yes, \/pol\/ agrees on many things, and it is typically very right leaning, however there are glimmers of libertarian and even liberal philosophies that most would agree if the terms were properly set and regulated. Furthermore, the constant regurgitating of ideas and arguments for or against specific political beliefs refines said arguments so that the next time around, more intimate discussion can occur (with the usual shitposting scattered between). Essentially, \/pol\/ is a bit of a think tank for the non elite. It cuts the bullshit fiction out of the equation, and deals with facts that are impossible to deny due to reputation or ego. Anonymity plays a large role into why this is possible, but since we are on a site, doing this for free, and not apart of some firm that could make or break your career in politics, the debate is much more open. Liberal threads get shit because liberal ideologies, historically speaking, have been a absolute disaster for humanity, and the shortsightedness of leftists thinking this time would be any different is laughable. So do you research, keep your arguments strong, and for the love of god, don&#039;t feed the trolls.","filename":"1475418578322","ext":".jpg","w":720,"h":720,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490464419961,"time":1490464419,"md5":"OXwPP0148suNEsRj8Cfobg==","fsize":39595,"resto":118247277,"id":"cOFnwH\/V","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118250486,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)13:55:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118247277\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118247277<\/a><br>It&#039;s just easy to get sweet sweet (you)s by drumpfposting.","time":1490464523,"resto":118247277,"id":"Umo+NGsu","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118250752,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)13:57:50","com":"<a href=\"#p118247277\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118247277<\/a><br>ITT: Anti-fa and shareblue trying to hide themselves, and failing miserably.","time":1490464670,"resto":118247277,"id":"MEHtLR+D","country":"US","trip":"!niqjediPCA","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118250980,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)13:59:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118250314\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118250314<\/a><br>good post d00d","time":1490464794,"resto":118247277,"id":"UdI7DUTD","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118251186,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)14:01:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118247277\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118247277<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;anyone who disagrees with god emperor is a shill<\/span><br> <br>Friend the safe space is here r\/the_donald\/ shills are not allowed there","filename":"1484502372929","ext":".jpg","w":227,"h":275,"tn_w":103,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490464904933,"time":1490464904,"md5":"tL358tJoFZTFXZT+Inrtlg==","fsize":26726,"resto":118247277,"id":"ivwedgJx","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118251211,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)14:02:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118247277\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118247277<\/a><br>t.Shareblue (or is it JIDF?)","filename":"D150DCC9A3934F98B90E9280206533A168690000089B0792FC8F_tmp","ext":".jpg","w":506,"h":375,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":92,"tim":1490464924269,"time":1490464924,"md5":"uZNoGblqpzax79g0dBdPLw==","fsize":182374,"resto":118247277,"id":"mVUV28Sk","country":"CL","country_name":"Chile"},{"no":118251338,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)14:03:18","name":"Anonymous","filename":"Cuckc","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":628,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":76,"tim":1490464998039,"time":1490464998,"md5":"jIt3B+TX63caxpbUNuCJqw==","fsize":87627,"resto":118247277,"id":"kqI8EWrp","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118251616,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)14:06:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118250314\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118250314<\/a><br>good post desu~","time":1490465160,"resto":118247277,"id":"eDHD21jp","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118252475,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)14:14:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118250314\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118250314<\/a><br><a href=\"#p118250314\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118250314<\/a><br>Well said<br>I also suspect this place has become some sort of refuge for a certain subset of middle-aged social rejects who use right-wing politics as a proxy against a political and cultural climate that has failed them and doesn&#039;t adress their issues anymore<br>A lot of woman-hating, climate change denial and hyper anti-leftist strawmanning is probably coming from them, creating this weird schizo vibe in some threads.. on the other hand, it&#039;s probably the reason most moderate, normal people avoid this place like the plague","time":1490465655,"resto":118247277,"id":"AKX3jq7z","country":"FR","country_name":"France"}]}

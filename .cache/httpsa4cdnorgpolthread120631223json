Take for example question 2. If I were to be totalitarian, my position would be to control the viewpoints of the church to cement my control. The question on religion however assumes the church must be an independent body, and taking a libertarian view asks of you how this independent body should be funded.<br><br>As an authoritarian I would use money to buy influence in the church, or if not possible then dissolve it entirely. If they were not compliant, and since there is no option to dissolve them, then as an independent body with views independent of mine I would be inclined to not want to fund them. The question wrongfully assumes that my stance to say that such an independent church should fuck off and finance itself is a libertarian position.","filename":"religion","ext":".png","w":561,"h":191,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":42,"tim":1491935173378,"time":1491935173,"md5":"9yfs1UCTPSBj9mmsnUjF\/A==","fsize":28464,"resto":120631223,"id":"b3AfAwcU","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120634749,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)14:38:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"here u go OP, just 4 u babeeeeeee","filename":"rombo","ext":".png","w":550,"h":520,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":118,"tim":1491935905100,"time":1491935905,"md5":"30\/AbWcgqXjGM3FyjaOCyQ==","fsize":62320,"resto":120631223,"id":"xLwTp8oQ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120634861,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)14:39:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120634749\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120634749<\/a><br>shit note to everyone, don&#039;t &quot;save file&quot;, screencap or else your plot won&#039;t show up","filename":"Screen Shot 2017-04-11 at 2.38.39 PM","ext":".png","w":557,"h":586,"tn_w":118,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491935960207,"time":1491935960,"md5":"Govj2cl4ybVJ8mIRsIZJOg==","fsize":100777,"resto":120631223,"id":"xLwTp8oQ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120636629,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)14:51:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120631223\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120631223<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;http:\/\/www.polquiz.com\/test\/<\/span><br>Huh, not as far left as I though I was.","filename":"politics","ext":".png","w":557,"h":611,"tn_w":113,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491936700331,"time":1491936700,"md5":"BnfVLeGNaOB6TmU54t3KUg==","fsize":67880,"resto":120631223,"id":"\/f0jz+wF","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

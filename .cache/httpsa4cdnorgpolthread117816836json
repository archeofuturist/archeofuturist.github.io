There are many US based products that try to break into the Mexican-esque market, but Mexico&#039;s cheap prices are heard to compete with so these US products are sold in specific regions or marketed as a premium product. It&#039;s really the only advantage Mexican based products have since, culturally, Mexico has a bad reputation with most people even before Trump.<br><br>Now if Mexican products suddenly spike up in price to try and compensate for the tariff, Americans are not going to blindly purchase said products, at least not consciously. The US based companies will see an opportunity to expand their businesses in a once hard-to-breach market now that Mexico is at a disadvantage. There will be an aggressive marketing campaign from all sides to label their product as the go-to alternative. Businesses in Mexico will also attempt to do the same, so those who dominated once in Mexico will now have to compete with both US and Mexican counterparts.<br><br>I&#039;m not accounting any nationalism or boycotting. This is just how the market tends to work. In the end it&#039;s going to boil down to not who pays the wall, but who loses out at the end.

Democracy is not the path to getting where we need to be, but people seem too docile to really do anything about it. No matter what, parasites that rule our nations will be there until they&#039;re forcefully removed. But how?<br><br>I honestly think the US is fucked at this point. It&#039;ll be used like a dried up whore until it&#039;s ready to collapse, and the parasites will move onto another host body once it&#039;s completed.<br><br>Over in Europe, I don&#039;t have much hope either. Looking at birthrates in Asia and Africa, Europeans will simply be outbred. Instead of small rafts carrying niggers, we&#039;ll see large ships full of them going to Europe. Blacks and Arabs will suffocate Europe more and more every year. The demographics are not in our favor.<br><br>Is this downfall inevitable?

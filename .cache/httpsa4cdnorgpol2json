When you still have original radioactive material around in Chernobyl, one can expect it to be &quot;ionizing radiation&quot; due to the photons having a high energy. But the Photons (i.e. X-rays) are not the problem, other emitted Neutrons are the problem.<br><br>These Neutrons have the possibilty to split atoms in the surrounding matter if their energy is high enough, creating possibly daughter nucleus that might also be radioactive. As a result, certain radioactive matter has the ability to make it&#039;s surrounding also radioactive (in a very simplistic description), hence total radiation levels increase.<br><br>How long these materials are active depends on their halftime, but imagine you have 10-20 different materials that have become radioactive each with a different halftime, up to decades or hundreds of years.<br><br>In a nuke all the energy is not released by neutrons but through photons which can&#039;t split additional nucleus to create additional radioactive matter... the radiation from a nuke is basically just from the few kg of radioactive matter inside the nuke, which of course is rather small compared to several reactors in a nuclear plant.","time":1491849479,"resto":120466454,"id":"IkyKMmzf","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":120470498,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)14:38:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120466454\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120466454<\/a><br>WTF?

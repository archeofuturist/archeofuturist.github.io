Atheism is in decline worldwide, with the number of atheists falling from 4.5% of the world&#039;s population in 1970 to 2.0% in 2010 and projected to drop to 1.8% by 2020, <br><br>Real surveys and statistics say atheism is on the decline worldwide. Sorry atheists but atheism is not on the rise nor is it winning. It&#039;s still the minority and a declining one at that. <br><br>The Pew Research Center&#039;s statistics show that atheism is expected to continue to decline all the way into 2050 with a continued growth of religion. Other research also shows a huge surge in growth for Christianity in China which is currently the world&#039;s most &quot;atheist&quot; nation because of the atheist communist government suppressing religion, the research suggests that China will soon become the world&#039;s most Christian nation within 15 years. <br><br>This is simply history repeating itself: Christianity prospered in Rome back in the ancient era when it was suppressed and it still grew in the militant atheist soviet Russia when it was suppressed there only a century ago with the majority of Russians today now also identifying as Christian. Just goes to show that atheist suppression of religion still doesn&#039;t stop religion.<br><br>Sources for the legion of whiny \/Redditor\/ fedoras that will no doubt show up it this thread:<br><br>http:\/\/www.pewforum.org\/2015\/04\/02\/<wbr>religious-projections-2010-2050\/<br>http:\/\/www.pewforum.org\/2012\/12\/18\/<wbr>global-religious-landscape-unaffili<wbr>ated\/<br>http:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/news\/wor<wbr>ldnews\/asia\/china\/10776023\/China-on<wbr>-course-to-become-worlds-most-Chris<wbr>tian-nation-within-15-years.html<br>http:\/\/masterrussian.com\/russia\/fac<wbr>ts.htm","filename":"1490142549767","ext":".jpg","w":608,"h":755,"tn_w":201,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490432380419,"time":1490432380,"md5":"gbLQR\/M\/TdWWLU+dYjIA+Q==","fsize":123410,"resto":0,"id":"lit19FvC","country":"PL","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"atheism-is-the-fastest-shrinking-religion-in-the","country_name":"Poland","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":118203032,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)04:12:57","name":"Anonymous","sub":"\/ptg\/ PRESIDENT TRUMP GENERAL - &quot;Cesspool on the Potomac&quot; EDITION","com":"PRESIDENT DONALD J TRUMP<br>https:\/\/www.whitehouse.gov<br>https:\/\/www.donaldjtrump.com\/<br>DAILY SCHEDULE (WH Press Corps)<br>https:\/\/publicpool.kinja.com\/<br>Trump Playlist<br>http:\/\/pastebin.com\/X9qQJVKJ<br> <br>APPEARANCES<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Pres Trump meets with Truckers 3\/23\/17<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/o9pT5vs6sGY<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Pres Trump roundtable w\/truckers 3\/23\/17<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/PydyBIHjrVk<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Pres Trump meets w\/black cucks 3\/22\/17<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/3b3eF89e0WQ<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Pres Trump meets w\/women in healthcare panel 3\/22\/17<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/wQs3SBVvOu8<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Pres Trump speech at NRCCD 3\/21\/17<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/_pfD_EmYvBM<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Pres Trump signs s.442 NASA Act 3\/21\/17<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/9HzadC1imjQ<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Pres Trump rally in Louisville KY 3\/20\/17<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/wrR7Fq5OQa0 (RSBNiggers)<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;SC Nominee Neil Gorsuch 3\/20\/17<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/YvY0-DztxTg<br>PREV APPEARANCES<br>http:\/\/pastebin.com\/ynXV6CHT<br>NEWTRUMP NIGHTLY NEWS<br>http:\/\/pastebin.com\/yArfUKdC<br>WH PRESS BRIEFINGS<br>http:\/\/pastebin.com\/QidpHWKJ<br> <br>FUN STUFF<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;TrumpWave S P A C E<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/s1qhafzPkAM<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The Story behind MAGA hats<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/Aoro6PA9S6g<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Female Trump vs Male shillary<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/9yC7-JsR2Fk<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;God Emperor Trump Was Born To Rule<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/pf4RSgb_Pqg<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Donald Trump Emperor of America<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/xQCaWLF2gfs<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;TrumpBot vs Mexico<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/jNmTBESoJ1A<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Shadilay<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/ZNriNoWOtXA<br> <br>INSPIRATION<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/Nyuv_bPSHBA<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Hold Back The Night<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/ldnH5ms50Jc<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Inauguration of Fire<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/XKf8jSiaghU<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;#TrumpTheEstablishement<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/kIsctZlgMqg<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;American Hero<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/d-X3BVxySLo<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;TRUMP - MAGA<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/PagVeZgHbhk<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Trump Triumphant<\/span><br>www.dailymotion.com\/video\/x4ulway<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;We Are The Silent Majority<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/3lrrPG5iPAk<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;American Comeback Story<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/pm8n9qVIK_8<br> <br>OP pastebin: http:\/\/pastebin.com\/nygxu29R<br>prev <a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/118199338#p118199338\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118199338<\/a>","filename":"1484832237894","ext":".jpg","w":1200,"h":859,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":178,"tim":1490429577350,"time":1490429577,"md5":"t2IBZEwLTkuVgAJmH3O4KQ==","fsize":253150,"resto":0,"id":"C5dr15BF","country":"AU","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"ptg-president-trump-general-cesspool-on-the","country_name":"Australia","replies":191,"images":85,"omitted_posts":186,"omitted_images":80,"tail_size":50},{"no":118205972,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)04:59:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118205845\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118205845<\/a><br>Not really no.

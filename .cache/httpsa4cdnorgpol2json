The father by law exclusively without any interference decides who they date and whom they can marry.<br>4. Women should not be allowed in the work place with other males unless the work place segregates females from males.

Reinstate miscegenation laws while grandfathering in those already mixed race couples already married.<br>7. Overtly positive representations of adultery, homosexuality and miscegenation (whites with blacks) on TV, film and music should be prosecuted.

He was still a young man when he wrote it, and not yet a philosopher. He was interested, however, in who they were, and how they philosophized. A few years later, after Dawn, though arguably in 1879, N considered himself a philosopher and he wrote as such.

It&#039;s not the content of their philosophy, or rather, the content matters only insofar as it reveals something about the personality of the philosopher. <br><br>The personality of the philosopher is all that matters to N. It&#039;s the only thing that&#039;s important to culture at large, which is why he even wrote Ecce Homo, a book which serves as a sort of reader&#039;s guide to his other works, but which at every point refers the reader back to N&#039;s personality. <br><br>Basically read PTAG (in which N talks about all these genuinely philosophical personas) and then read Ecce Homo as a continuation of that work, i.e., one in which N talks about N as a genuinely philosophical persona.","time":1491024570,"resto":119146119,"id":"gclsp9yY","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":119149385,"now":"04\/01\/17(Sat)01:29:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"Makes me sick, another neva-do-nuthin having a chimpout<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Killed Asian wife, mother to his child with cyanide after beating her to death in the driveway.<\/span><br><br>http:\/\/www.13newsnow.com\/news\/local<wbr>\/mycity\/virginia-beach\/prosecution-<wbr>man-poisoned-estranged-wife-with-cy<wbr>anide-had-fiancee-in-china\/42724535<wbr>0<br><br>Now his kid has no mother or father, he tried to escape to China.","filename":"QwSiY3k","ext":".png","w":607,"h":291,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":119,"tim":1491024566884,"time":1491024566,"md5":"rovxL6h6MwSA3WFtNjSrhQ==","fsize":168055,"resto":0,"id":"5+i56pwM","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"makes-me-sick-another-nevadonuthin-having-a","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":119149277,"now":"04\/01\/17(Sat)01:27:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"Jordan Peterson is going to start a series of videos that do a psychological explanation of the Bible starting in mid-May.

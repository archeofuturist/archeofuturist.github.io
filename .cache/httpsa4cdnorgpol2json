weapons transfers to Saudi Arabia, saying Washington and London are fueling the serious human rights violations and devastating civilian casualties in Yemen committed by Riyadh.<br><br>\u201cThe USA and UK are fueling serious violations that have caused devastating civilian suffering through multi-billion-dollar arms transfers to Saudi Arabia that vastly overshadow their humanitarian efforts,\u201d the UK-based human rights group said in a statement on Thursday.<br><br>Saudi Arabia launched a war against Yemen in March 2015 in an attempt to bring back former president Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi to power and undermine the Houthi Ansarullah movement.<br><br>Hadi, a staunch ally of Riyadh, fled Yemen after a popular uprising against his corrupt government.<br><br>London and Washington have been providing logistic and intelligence support to Saudi Arabia, while equipping the kingdom\u2019s military forces with a wide array of weapons including illegal munitions like cluster bombs.<br><br>Amnesty said the US and the UK have sold over $5 billion worth of weapons to the Riyadh regime since the onset of the invasion, more than 10 times the $450 million they have allegedly spent to help save Yemeni civilians.<br><br>\u201cDespite the millions of dollars\u2019 worth of international assistance allocated to the country, many states have contributed to the suffering of the Yemeni people by continuing to supply billions of dollars\u2019 worth of arms,\u201d said Lynn Maalouf, Amnesty\u2019s deputy director for research in Beirut.<br><br>\u201cWeapons supplied in the past by states such as the UK and USA have been used to commit gross violations and helped to precipitate a humanitarian catastrophe,\u201d she

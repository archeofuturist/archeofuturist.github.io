The reason is easy to understand, females are attracted to aggressive and dominant alpha males, that&#039;s because human evolution, as it happened according to the law of the jungle, in the state of nature of the &quot;Hobbesian&quot; war of all against all, made women evolve to seek the protection of such violent men, and even after six thousand years of civilization, women have not evolved out of it (see Camille Paglia&#039;s Sexual Persona for the atavistic brain of the human female).<br><br>And who is the foremost dominant, violent and aggressive alpha male? It&#039;s the black man. That&#039;s why so many taboos were manufactured around his presence, it was so lesser males couldn&#039;t have their women stolen by them, but as liberal capitalism removes all traditions, nothing can stand in the way of black cock supremacy anymore. I believe the last time a white man will have sex with a white woman will be somewhere in 2034. Afterwards, it will be only black, black, black.","filename":"1438282499130","ext":".jpg","w":1242,"h":933,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1491868617201,"time":1491868617,"md5":"ZAFbbgbhtpJehzQ30sMqiA==","fsize":347293,"resto":120508501,"id":"xfIGYV6P","country":"BR","m_img":1,"country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":120514965,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)19:59:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120509409\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120509409<\/a><br>Did you like it in UK?

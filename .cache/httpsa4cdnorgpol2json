So technically, Muslims can&#039;t tax each other. So this historically leaves 2 sources of income for the government, raiding and non-muslims. So Mohammed early on said that there is no compulsion in religion, and morons wanting to say Islam is peaceful and tolerate will repeat that crock of shit all day. In practice, Mohammed, the perfect man who did everything right, just walked up and said &#039;You either convert, die, or keep your religion but pay me a crippling sum of money&#039;<br><br>Now, the Jizya tax had to make up the entire taxbase, so it was ludicrous. Adding onto that, you could technically keep your religion, but you could never build a religious building, you cannot worship in public ever, and you cannot wear or present iconography of your faith in public ever. What happens if you need to move to a bigger church or your&#039;s burns down for totally unexplainable reasons? Too bad, you can&#039;t build a new one. And you&#039;re being crushed under taxes. So you end up &#039;converting&#039; but really you hate those muslim fucks. But because of the previous point you have to play the good muslim or your neighbors will kill you. And then you have to raise your kids as legitimate muslims and they won&#039;t be pretending even if you were because if you let them know you were pretending they might let something slip and you all die.

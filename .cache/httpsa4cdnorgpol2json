And therefore the prophets used to exhort men to what was good, to act justly and to work righteousness, as I have so largely demonstrated, because it is in our power so to do, and because by excessive negligence we might become forgetful, and thus stand in need of that good counsel which the good God has given us to know by means of the prophets.<br><br>Sola Fide btfo","time":1491343088,"resto":119510508,"id":"y6yG3kgh","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119522872,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)17:59:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119522200\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119522200<\/a><br>If you&#039;re waiting for me to throw out a passage, it&#039;s not going to happen.

Today, a woman can empower herself through actions as seemingly inconsequential as driving her children to soccer practice or watching the Oxygen network.&quot;<br><br>Klein said that clothes-shopping, once considered a mundane act with few sociopolitical implications, is now a bold feminist statement.<br><br>&quot;Shopping for shoes has emerged as a powerful means by which women assert their autonomy,&quot; Klein said. &quot;Owning and wearing dozens of pairs of shoes is a compelling way for a woman to announce that she is strong and independent, and can shoe herself without the help of a man. She&#039;s saying, &#039;Look out, male-dominated world, here comes me and my shoes.&#039;&quot;<br><br>Eating energy bars specially fortified with nutrients &quot;for women&quot; has become a feminist trend, as well.<br><br>&quot;Unlike traditional, phallocentric energy bars, whose chocolate, soy protein, nuts, and granola ignored the special health and nutritional needs of women, their new, female-oriented counterparts like Luna are ideally balanced with a more suitable amount of chocolate, soy protein, nuts and granola,&quot; Klein said. &quot;Proto-feminist pioneers like Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B.

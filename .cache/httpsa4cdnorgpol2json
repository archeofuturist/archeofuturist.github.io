Why should God be better than us?&#039; Think about it a bit more, and then you tell me. We were created in the image of God; in the beginning God, walked among us. Why can we no longer, in our natural state, walk with God? Why are we kept separate from Him, made to follow laws to which he is not subject? This is because we have fallen short; we have become less, and now we need to be governed, else the evil aspects of our nature destroy all of creation entirely.<br><br>Let&#039;s consider even more: despite the fact that there&#039;s no reason for God to follow these rules, he chose to condescend in the form of Jesus to spend time on this earth following all of God&#039;s rules.

If you claim that your only sin is against God, you still lie. <br><br>The purpose of Jesus&#039; incarnation and death is simply the defeat of sin. If we commune with Christ, and if we are born of the Spirit, the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of God--the Spirit of Christ who overcame sin--resides in us, and we ourselves are given the power to overcome sin. As it was said, God became like us so that we might become like Him. The very deficit you see between God and man is precisely that which Christ filled through his death and resurrection.","time":1490160564,"resto":117689856,"id":"GPfi4VVg","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":117707901,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)22:37:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"How can you still support Trump after this?","filename":"Screenshot 2017-03-21 at 7.37.23 PM","ext":".png","w":943,"h":752,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":199,"tim":1490150269089,"time":1490150269,"md5":"8X\/TOjWA5nEDqWxY7c3QfQ==","fsize":512572,"resto":0,"id":"jm4UuVPz","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"how-can-you-still-support-trump-after-this","country_name":"United States","replies":102,"images":33,"omitted_posts":97,"omitted_images":30,"tail_size":50},{"no":117721388,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)00:46:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117721219\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117721219<\/a><br>cus I made it with my 4000 hours of photoshop skills","filename":"1489195299511","ext":".jpg","w":672,"h":960,"tn_w":87,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490157970742,"time":1490157970,"md5":"KQUyLQwnMIvBAd9KPyaTcw==","fsize":415509,"resto":117707901,"id":"pKA6ljuK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117723365,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)01:07:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117721388\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117721388<\/a>","time":1490159221,"resto":117707901,"id":"1HMTqjnd","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":117724840,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)01:22:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117707901\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117707901<\/a><br>Autism is an epidemic. <br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=2LB<wbr>sxyf-XCI<br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=2LB<wbr>sxyf-XCI<br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=2LB<wbr>sxyf-XCI","filename":"DLH2","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":390,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":76,"tim":1490160166081,"time":1490160166,"md5":"y6fq28zaxtKZTAv6jbz9ow==","fsize":135134,"resto":117707901,"id":"X6GjN84N","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117725226,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)01:26:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117707901\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117707901<\/a><br>Easy, 49ers would have won the Super Bowl with Alex Smith. <br><br>The jews (Roger Goodell is a kike as are most of the owners) were desperate for a nigger QB winning a Super Bowl.<br><br>Tom Brady has cucked Goodell and the owners several times, I used to hate Tom Brady and Belichick but I now know that they are the greatest thing to happen to the NFL in the last 20 years.","filename":"1459910796632","ext":".jpg","w":512,"h":366,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":89,"tim":1490160417656,"time":1490160417,"md5":"9x4WSWFtwaB0m40jUUO\/Sw==","fsize":141929,"resto":117707901,"id":"7aeyEidc","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117725437,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)01:29:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117707901\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117707901<\/a><br>Because propaganda doesn&#039;t bother me.<br><br>Literally has no effect on my emotion.<br><br>I&#039;d give my life for Christianity &amp; America.","time":1490160563,"resto":117707901,"id":"MUAcYxh2","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}]}

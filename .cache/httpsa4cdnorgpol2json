The NCVS is a yearly survey of over 150,000 respondents of which many U.S. Government crime publications and much academic research is based. From 1996 through 2008, the BJS provided extensive tables of which several showed statistics of crimes where the race of the both the victim and the perpetrator(s) were summarized.<br><br>One of the most used tables, \u201cTable: 42 Personal Crimes of Violence,\u201d is only available through 2008 on the BJS website. However, other articles have been published utilizing \u201cTable 42\u201d from 2010. Gotnews.com has obtained a copy of the 2010 table that was obtained from the BJS. Either the 2010 table was previously published on the BJS website and later removed, or the table was provided directly by BJS to the article authors. If the BJS is continuing to create these tables why isn\u2019t it publishing them?<br><br>In 2012, the BJS replaced the yearly publication of the NCVS Statistical Tables with a new online analysis tool called the NVAT which does not provide access to the interracial crime data. The only option now is to retrieve this information is through manipulation of the raw survey data which requires extensive programming. The annual budget for the NCVS was over $36 million for 2014 and represents over 75 percent of the Bureau of Justice Statistics core budget.","time":1490494358,"resto":118304109,"id":"Pp\/CWw+b","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118306643,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)22:13:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"https:\/\/www.amren.com\/archives\/repo<wbr>rts\/the-color-of-crime-2016-revised<wbr>-edition\/","time":1490494432,"resto":118304109,"id":"Qzg1mtl\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118306717,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)22:14:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118305642\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118305642<\/a><br>there are like 100 mass shootings in a year and like 1% of americans are muslims<br><br>if one muslim does a mass shooting of course they&#039;re going to be massively overrepresented <br><br>this is a bad graph, and if you show this to a leftist they will tell you the exact same thing i&#039;m telling you right now, except they will follow up by calling you a racist drumpffuck","time":1490494482,"resto":118304109,"id":"49\/\/t4N1","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118283558,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)18:47:07","name":"OP","sub":"FALL OF ROME RISK","com":"IMPORTANT!<br><br>Before you pick a faction, look at its information here!<br><br>http:\/\/pastebin.com\/jLWsVBiE (embed) (embed) (embed)<br><br>IMPORTANT!<br><br><br>Game will start when 2 players join","filename":"Provincial map","ext":".png","w":2822,"h":1527,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":135,"tim":1490482027323,"time":1490482027,"md5":"fu5KLhAZCHbU8qCQarCXew==","fsize":517068,"resto":0,"id":"rXS4Lx1K","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"fall-of-rome-risk","country_name":"United States","replies":126,"images":18,"omitted_posts":121,"omitted_images":14,"tail_size":50},{"no":118306110,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)22:09:07","name":"Scythians","com":"<a href=\"#p118306016\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118306016<\/a><br>INVADE anteans","time":1490494147,"resto":118283558,"id":"LjL\/ePVS","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118306302,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)22:10:45","name":"King Ethelric of the Saxons","com":"<a href=\"#p118306016\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118306016<\/a><br>Surround and Capture the Angles Capital","time":1490494245,"resto":118283558,"id":"b45jt2p6","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118306529,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)22:12:43","name":"King Karl I of the Franks","com":"<a href=\"#p118306016\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118306016<\/a><br>The Franks continue into Lugdunesis, which some amongst the Frankish people are naming Frankia.<br><br>Within the Kingdom, it is now known that Prince Pepin is expecting a child, the smallfolk consider this a blessing.","time":1490494363,"resto":118283558,"id":"mlyfv\/cl","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118306638,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)22:13:48","name":"Scythians","com":"Nvm, attack persia","time":1490494428,"resto":118283558,"id":"LjL\/ePVS","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118306713,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)22:14:41","name":"Eastern Rome","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Resettle Anatolia<\/span>","time":1490494481,"resto":118283558,"id":"lO6KbYoV","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118303180,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)21:41:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"How damaging will not getting healthcare done be to the rest of Trump&#039;s agenda?

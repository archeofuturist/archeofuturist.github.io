Daily reminder that sea levels around the world were about 400 feet lower just before the end of the last Ice Age.<br><br>Near the end of the last Ice Age about 12,800 years ago, a giant comet that had entered the Solar System from deep space thousands of years earlier, broke into multiple fragments. Some of these fragments struck Earth, causing a global cataclysm unseen since the extinction of the dinosaurs. At least eight of the fragments hit the North American ice cap, while further fragments hit the Northern European ice cap. The impacts, from comet fragments a mile wide approaching at more than 60,000 miles an hour, generated huge amounts of heat which instantly liquidised millions of square kilometres of ice, destabilising Earth&#039;s crust and causing the global flood that is remembered in myths all around the world.<br><br>A second series of impacts, equally devastasting, causing further cataclysmic flooding, occurred about 11,600 years ago, the exact date that Plato gives for the destruction and submergence of Atlantis. The evidence for all of this shows beyond reasonable doubt that a civilisation at least as technologically advanced as 19th-century England at the onset of the Industrial Revolution (if not more technologically advanced) that flourished during the last Ice Age was destroyed in the global cataclysms between about 12,800 years ago and about 11,600 years ago.<br><br>A distant memory and a warning to the future - for the comet that wrought such destruction in remote antiquity may not be done with us yet.","filename":"iceagemap","ext":".png","w":853,"h":440,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":128,"tim":1493127842998,"time":1493127842,"md5":"cs0+u5uti9vK6vqtSQSaoQ==","fsize":557051,"resto":0,"id":"MT5xsBCS","country":"AU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-red-parts-of-this-map-used-to-be-land-daily","country_name":"Australia","replies":170,"images":39,"omitted_posts":165,"omitted_images":37,"tail_size":50},{"no":122755433,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)12:57:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122755130\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122755130<\/a><br>I do too, but most of \/pol\/ does not unfortunately.","time":1493139470,"resto":122734952,"id":"1OHHoJNF","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":122755444,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)12:57:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122755064\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122755064<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;(which we can&#039;t reproduce today)<\/span><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Bsq<wbr>OLCXYznE","time":1493139473,"resto":122734952,"id":"ia25bJqi","country":"HU","country_name":"Hungary"},{"no":122755584,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)12:59:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122755247\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122755247<\/a><br>Take a look at Detroit","time":1493139548,"resto":122734952,"id":"jL91voqQ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122755608,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)12:59:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122734952\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122734952<\/a><br>Map\/globe maker here.

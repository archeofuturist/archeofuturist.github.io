Trump stepping down from office and resigning in fear of facing impeachment proceedings. This will be the first weekend where President Trump will not be going to Mar-a-Lago, his commonly known &quot;Southern White House&quot; as many speculate that President Trump will be buckling down on these new allegations that he had colluded with Russia and had help from Russia&#039;s leader, Vladimir Putin. <br><br>The source also stated to media that the entire campaign is in frenzy mode and that all people are now making the appropriate measures to bolster ties with Vice President Michael Pence. &quot;Everything is in a total state of chaos here, Trump could be facing criminal charges and if that were to happen, it would cause an immediate investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (sic) into tampering with the election which could bring about totally different results in which case Hillary R. Clinton could be named the actual victor in the presidential election (sic) - this would be much, much larger and more scandalous in nature than Watergate.&quot;<br><br>DEVELOPING STORY","filename":"bf5","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":631,"tn_w":237,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490934205736,"time":1490934205,"md5":"6T\/WQfOF4jy0AK54u4XrUA==","fsize":39406,"resto":0,"id":"OG6IMcZB","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"breaking-news","country_name":"United States","replies":210,"images":69,"omitted_posts":205,"omitted_images":69,"tail_size":50},{"no":119027273,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)01:57:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;new york times<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;sources say<\/span><br><br>Wow its fucking nothing","time":1490939853,"resto":119019087,"id":"qpLeQqot","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":119027308,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)01:57:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119027249\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119027249<\/a><br>S","filename":"SHOUTOUT","ext":".png","w":1070,"h":462,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":53,"tim":1490939878790,"time":1490939878,"md5":"+QaIkYVvJ3d6eizkkim7Ig==","fsize":815027,"resto":119019087,"id":"M88\/K8S\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119027362,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)01:58:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119027308\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119027308<\/a><br>H","filename":"bs2","ext":".png","w":419,"h":531,"tn_w":98,"tn_h":124,"tim":1490939925481,"time":1490939925,"md5":"9PZBRya2bJ1l8OOmZjc9+A==","fsize":382333,"resto":119019087,"id":"M88\/K8S\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119027398,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)01:59:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119026667\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119026667<\/a><br>chk&#039;d","filename":"Zero Daze","ext":".jpg","w":720,"h":359,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":62,"tim":1490939952371,"time":1490939952,"md5":"TzJzsw5qy0GLoAEemuTOpQ==","fsize":43617,"resto":119019087,"id":"QAcC7aYN","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119027407,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)01:59:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119027362\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119027362<\/a><br>I","filename":"a72","ext":".png","w":460,"h":256,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":69,"tim":1490939962764,"time":1490939962,"md5":"X1FbMdkxnxn3azkzXaNPBg==","fsize":208465,"resto":119019087,"id":"M88\/K8S\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":119010896,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)23:04:11","name":"Anonymous","sub":"FALSE FLAG????","com":"Noam Chomsky: Donald Trump Planning To Stage Terror Attack Against America<br><br>https:\/\/twitter.com\/infowars\/status<wbr>\/847644652350054400","filename":"download","ext":".png","w":616,"h":604,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":245,"tim":1490929451384,"time":1490929451,"md5":"AEypvwYKMnnNwVzXDwimMg==","fsize":372466,"resto":0,"id":"vtYZsbBY","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"false-flag","country_name":"United States","replies":46,"images":5,"omitted_posts":41,"omitted_images":5},{"no":119024143,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)01:18:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119018952\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119018952<\/a><br>no it won&#039;t. this guy knows once terrorist actually attack trump is going to clamp down on every obama plant and completely destroy leftist\/feminist\/kikes.<br><br>he&#039;s saying this because he understands that any attack trump will gain support and power from so he&#039;s saying trump is the one doing the attack to just make noise","time":1490937508,"resto":119010896,"id":"e5HbLOuE","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119025808,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)01:39:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119011241\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119011241<\/a><br>Bless you Bruce. <br>THIS.","time":1490938760,"resto":119010896,"id":"zmGw1qef","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119026831,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)01:51:49","com":"<a href=\"#p119010896\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119010896<\/a><br>I think ol chomskey is going a bit senile.","time":1490939509,"resto":119010896,"id":"YA8zH4HV","country":"US","trip":"!niqjediPCA","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119027219,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)01:56:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119010896\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119010896<\/a><br><br>hes on top form in this video<br><br>top kek <br><br>&quot;nooo teh poor eliiiites&quot;","time":1490939814,"resto":119010896,"id":"4PyjRaEK","country":"NZ","country_name":"New Zealand"},{"no":119027402,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)01:59:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119015768\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119015768<\/a><br>Only Afghanistan was invaded after 9\/11 because that&#039;s where Bin Laden was primary operating out of.

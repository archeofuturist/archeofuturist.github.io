Without effective guaranteed nuclear payload deliverance, MAD is thrown out the window. MAD was almost solely responsible for the decrease in hot, head on wars since WWII, with nuclear powers realizing that war would not be worth the potential risk of mutual annihilation. However, if ICBMs and nuclear missiles become mostly ineffective, then it opens up the possibility once again for conventional warfare between large-scale countries.<br><br>Since numerous anti-missile defense systems are being developed at the moment, shouldn&#039;t this concern us?

Also, there is the issue of mobilizing populations for war in a world where information is becoming harder and harder to control.<br>So what I think you might get is a increase of war in peripheral areas.

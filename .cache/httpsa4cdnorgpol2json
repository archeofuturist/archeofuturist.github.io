In April 1995, the Omnibus Counter Terrorism Bill was struggling to get through the US Congress. After the OKC Bombing occurred, the tragedy looked as though it had been tailor-made to rally public support for the tyrannical bill.<br>2. The morning of the bombing, the ATF office located inside the Murrah building was empty, unheard of at 9 AM on a weekday.<br><br>3. Oklahoma Congressman Ernest Istook told a victim in a taped conversation in 1995 that the OKC bombing was a failed a national security operation that used an FBI provocateur associated with a militia.<br><br>4. The ATF was already putting out a story that the Murrah Building was bombed &quot;because of Waco&quot; only a few hours after the actual blast and before Tim McVeigh was even arrested.<br><br>5. An unexploded bomb was found attached to a gas line inside the building, and a FEMA memo reports at least two additional bombs were found in the Murrah Building. Joe Harp, based on his military explosives experience, identified the additional bombs he saw removed from the building as being military in nature.<br><br>6. General Benton K. Partin, USAF (Ret.) stated in his OKC Bombing report to US Congress that &quot;The bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building, Oklahoma City, was not caused solely by the truck bomb. The major factor in its destruction appears to have been detonation of explosives carefully placed at four critical junctures on supporting columns within the building.&quot;<br><br>7. Prior to the OKC bombing US Senator Arlan Specter as well as Clinton&#039;s NSC director Anthony Lake had been advocating federal national security operations to stop militias in America. Anthony Lake gave a speech to the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) in the Fall of 1994 in which he said the chief cornerstone of government policy was to &quot;pit our society against militias&quot;.<br><br>http:\/\/nstarzone.com\/OKC.html","time":1493161846,"resto":122801532,"id":"rDobtSFy","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"},{"no":122804132,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)19:11:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122803699\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122803699<\/a><br><a href=\"#p122802113\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122802113<\/a><br>One of the things that really surprised me was that the museum in the building across the street actually has a preserved rocket launcher that was recovered from the rubble with a plaque saying something about how it shouldn&#039;t have been there at the time and that there was a mix-up.

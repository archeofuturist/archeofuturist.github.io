But no, that&#039;s (sadly) not the case. Here&#039;s why.<br>1.China&#039;s 2016 GDP Annual Growth Rate was merely 6.8%, meanwhile China Inflation Rate (CPI) was 2% and the devaluation of China&#039;s Yuan to US dollar was about -6.8%, which means China&#039;s GDP actually decreased 2% in 2016 if we use US dollar to measure it.<br>you can watch the vid in that thread if you don&#039;t believe me &gt;&gt;<a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/119449928#p119449928\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119449928<\/a> <br>2.

Finally, the elephant in the room - China&#039;s housing bubble. The size of housing market in China is about 240 trillion, and China&#039;s GDP is 65 trillion (using Chinese yuan), that&#039;s almost 400% of its GDP. The burst of the bubble will make the 2008 US subprime mortgage crisis looks like a fairy tale.

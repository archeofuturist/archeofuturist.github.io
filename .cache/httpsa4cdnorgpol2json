Then we wouldn&#039;t have to worry about race wars. :( Up until these last few years, I never thought of such things at all. My biggest allegiance is to science and technology (which I thought of as a human thing rather than a white people thing until people started calling science racist colonialism and I started to realized white males invented 97% of my world with no one else contributing hardly anything).<br><br>That&#039;s a tough situation. I&#039;m a tomboyish female homo, and a lot of the more ethno-nationalists aren&#039;t super keen on that kind of thing. But I&#039;m still 100% white so if shit really hit the fan I imagine they and I could work some sort of truce out. Honestly my biggest worry is that we will quietly sink into oblivion without the fan blades ever biting the poo. If we do fight back, our odds are good (our racial tendencies seem to involve being ridiculously good at warfare and extreme creativity)...so long as we aren&#039;t fighting other white people, which seems kind of unlikely. I feel kind of doomed too. <br><br>The zombie civic nationalist in me feels really badly about your situation. I prize people who think like me over people who look like me and it&#039;s hard to accept that this is actually kind of self destructive. It seems to be pretty hard to get white people to act tribal even against people who clearly hate us. Maybe you can hide in the woods until it blows over. Even the most hardcore ethnos these days don&#039;t want to kill non whites, they just want them to go be brown somewhere else. And I mean, even in wwii the axis was more racially diverse than the allies. Perhaps you can work something out, too. A 40% white country is not ok, but 100% white is also unlikely. Even japan and korea are like 98% or so. If I were you I&#039;d strategize to get in that 2%. Actually liking us should give you a large leg up over a lot of your less appreciative peers. <br><br>(Sorry for spergy tldring)","time":1493198066,"resto":122851846,"id":"ofjxmn+H","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":122864529,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)05:13:04","name":"Anonymous","sub":"George Soros: Sociopath with a messiah complex or misunderstood humanitarian?","filename":"George_Soros","ext":".jpg","w":1177,"h":670,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":142,"tim":1493197984531,"time":1493197984,"md5":"BTWcKGECXbNms+A1R6DSwA==","fsize":375655,"resto":0,"id":"nq88k47P","country":"IE","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"george-soros-sociopath-with-a-messiah-complex-or","country_name":"Ireland","replies":1,"images":0},{"no":122864621,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)05:14:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122864529\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122864529<\/a><br>hes just trying to make the world a better place. dunno why people hate him.","time":1493198065,"resto":122864529,"id":"X+alhyTv","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"}]},{"posts":[{"no":122855072,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)02:44:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"Why is fascism good?","filename":"pretzels","ext":".jpg","w":3888,"h":2592,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1493189043894,"time":1493189043,"md5":"L4FNkQC6GtiPRSAidtypWQ==","fsize":2099834,"resto":0,"id":"bZFiyyn2","country":"PL","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"why-is-fascism-good","country_name":"Poland","replies":27,"images":11,"omitted_posts":22,"omitted_images":11},{"no":122863355,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)04:53:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122858267\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122858267<\/a><br><a href=\"#p122859008\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122859008<\/a><br><a href=\"#p122859535\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122859535<\/a><br><a href=\"#p122861898\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122861898<\/a><br><a href=\"#p122862893\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122862893<\/a><br>fuck off","time":1493196798,"resto":122855072,"id":"deha1FbA","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122863374,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)04:53:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122855957\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122855957<\/a><br>\/pol\/ is just full of racist liberals. <br><br>If it came to the point of actually restricting peoples freedom they won&#039;t do it.","filename":"oXi9926","ext":".png","w":580,"h":426,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":91,"tim":1493196806367,"time":1493196806,"md5":"RcwAdGVkBGYPvdC+Yjz\/tg==","fsize":326581,"resto":122855072,"id":"0v4PDgwr","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122863432,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)04:54:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122863355\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122863355<\/a><br>No","filename":"1484711147555","ext":".jpg","w":540,"h":720,"tn_w":93,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493196867942,"time":1493196867,"md5":"mDg7clwsIxjn+dilJqXQZg==","fsize":62348,"resto":122855072,"id":"jqDamUH9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122863603,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)04:57:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"Fascism is good because it makes corporations work for the state, allows the state to rapidly deal with changes in order to ensure prosperity for it&#039;s people.

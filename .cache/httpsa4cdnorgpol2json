Todd Nickerson, from Tennessee, wants to encourage other paedophiles to seek help and support for their sexual inclinations. He claims paedophilia is better understood as a sexual orientation - although one he believes it is unethical to act on. The 43-year-old is a moderator on the online forum \u2018VirPed\u2019 - short for \u2018virtuous paedophiles\u2019, also sometimes called \u2018ethical paedophiles\u2019 or \u2018gold star paedophiles\u2019. The terms are used to describe those who have an attraction to prepubescent children but control their urges and refrain from watching child pornography or seeking sexual contact with minors. The VirPed forum has a few thousand users, according to Nickerson, although not all of them are active members, and the site acts as a resource &#039;to help virtuous paedophiles remain law-abiding&#039;.<\/span>","filename":"WTF","ext":".png","w":1261,"h":885,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":175,"tim":1493249469691,"time":1493249469,"md5":"GssfrQ1Xc+8\/LEMiRgGdTg==","fsize":1005413,"resto":0,"id":"tfDO8QAW","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"virtous-paedophilia","country_name":"United States","replies":49,"images":14,"omitted_posts":44,"omitted_images":13},{"no":122966825,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)20:41:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122957922\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122957922<\/a><br>No jury outside of CA would convict if he got shot.","time":1493253684,"resto":122957922,"id":"RJbBGf7G","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122967091,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)20:43:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122966825\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122966825<\/a><br>no legal system in white history has supported killing people who literally haven&#039;t committed a crime","time":1493253797,"resto":122957922,"id":"s3fKTSbQ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122967119,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)20:43:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;One hand I feel bad for him, on the other hand, A FUCKING HOOK <\/span><br><br>Youtube comments are top tier sometimes","time":1493253813,"resto":122957922,"id":"TJG6CUoI","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122967161,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)20:43:53","name":"Anonymous","filename":"1616438","ext":".gif","w":128,"h":128,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493253833556,"time":1493253833,"md5":"YaW9fPPWzQCtPyu3cE6gww==","fsize":45682,"resto":122957922,"id":"Q19sV82X","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122967264,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)20:44:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122966811\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122966811<\/a><br>It&#039;s horseshoe theory as fuck, my dude","time":1493253879,"resto":122957922,"id":"yUknIgyU","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":122956629,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)19:21:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"Most redpilled game of 2017?<br><br>here me out \/pol\/<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;no sign of niggers anywhere, in any art or game footage<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;game focused on comradery of fellow soldiers and not the globalist goals of the allied powers<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;entire campaign is centered on killing krauts (the bane of western civilization that ruined ethnic nationalism for all white peoples)<\/span><br><br>thoughts?","filename":"CoD-Hub_Nav_Keyart","ext":".jpg","w":189,"h":189,"tn_w":189,"tn_h":189,"tim":1493248862402,"time":1493248862,"md5":"bMQQqUbuj9tqob7E5RWPPA==","fsize":17089,"resto":0,"id":"DEEMQrZ9","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"most-redpilled-game-of-2017","country_name":"United States","replies":62,"images":16,"omitted_posts":57,"omitted_images":14},{"no":122965677,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)20:32:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122964638\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122964638<\/a><br>Scots","filename":"53a32c5507600","ext":".png","w":512,"h":512,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493253157539,"time":1493253157,"md5":"ueHALhA14qHi269rrwTpDg==","fsize":159786,"resto":122956629,"id":"n+UnDZ2d","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122966628,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)20:39:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122957482\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122957482<\/a><br>French female resistance fighter?

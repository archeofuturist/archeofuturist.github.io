I&#039;m tall, actually moderately attractive, with a state job making ~145k a year in tech. I currently spend most of time free time reading, playing video games, working out, and cooking. Over the last 5 years or so I have slowly lost my desire for any kind of relationship with women. <br><br>I was not really a Chad, but I was one of the lucky few who was getting laid pretty steadily in high school, and on through college and my early adult life. I had my heart broken, and I broke some hearts. But the last 5 years I have really found the company of women in general to be less and less tolerable. Most of them want to talk about the same old boring shit. Whats on TV\/Movies\/Social Justice\/Whatever dumb hobby they&#039;re into. Given I live in a liberal infested shithole, it just seems like I can&#039;t find a single woman out there who brings any kind of excitement to the table anymore. Even the ones where politics is never brought up once. I don&#039;t drink often at all, not into the party scene. I despise degeneracy in general. I&#039;ve just gotten to the point where I&#039;m giving up hope on finding a decent companion, ya know? I can deal with it. Really, pussy is great and all, but it has seriously come to the point where I don&#039;t see it worth the effort of going through the motions of picking up women. Its like the same shit on repeat. Fuck it, I&#039;d rather just beat my meat in the shower every once in a while and call it even. <br><br>Given my growing apathy toward women in general, I&#039;ve come to question if this is strictly internal, or if the direction society is going is attributing to it. I didn&#039;t used to feel this way, but that was 5 years ago, before SJW, Cultural-marxism, and Socialism was mainstream. I see these &#039;anti-values&#039; reflected in the women I meet and it sickens me.<br><br>What does \/pol\/ think? Is society causing otherwise valuable males to drop out, and if so, how do we fix it, or am I just fucked in the head?","filename":"Going_alone","ext":".jpg","w":700,"h":465,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1492567023156,"time":1492567023,"md5":"rCRUXoxcriU8GLVGpF29OQ==","fsize":37872,"resto":0,"id":"9eSNTXku","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"am-i-the-problem-or-is-it-society","country_name":"United States","replies":236,"images":40,"omitted_posts":231,"omitted_images":39,"tail_size":50},{"no":121808907,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)01:39:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121808292\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121808292<\/a><br>Some cool shit bro","time":1492580382,"resto":121782238,"id":"JsYUZiGh","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121808941,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)01:40:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121785640\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121785640<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Anywheres better than the US\/UK though<\/span><br>Hardly, when everyone wants to come here","time":1492580406,"resto":121782238,"id":"gaEZWDHD","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121809219,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)01:42:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121808796\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121808796<\/a><br>i&#039;m not in venezuela, colombia is capitalist","time":1492580572,"resto":121782238,"id":"qF+sLS0S","country":"CO","country_name":"Colombia"},{"no":121809326,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)01:43:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121808907\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121808907<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121808907\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121808907<\/a><br>fuck you iw will send you with the sand niggers they love to rape your shit","time":1492580638,"resto":121782238,"id":"qF+sLS0S","country":"CO","country_name":"Colombia"},{"no":121809423,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)01:44:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121809326\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121809326<\/a><br>Cool story bro","time":1492580685,"resto":121782238,"id":"JsYUZiGh","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":121809418,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)01:44:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"don&#039;t reply to this thread","filename":"7","ext":".jpg","w":210,"h":240,"tn_w":210,"tn_h":240,"tim":1492580684412,"time":1492580684,"md5":"H3Bqsv3xy6z62D72jeC0Lg==","fsize":18532,"resto":0,"id":"DKwFt4Kw","country":"AR","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"dont-reply-to-this-thread","country_name":"Argentina","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":121775324,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)21:07:45","name":"Anonymous","sub":"\/HTG\/ HUMAN TRAFFICKING GENERAL 7: 4PLEBS SHOA EDITION","com":"These threads are for the purpose of human trafficking investigations.<br><br>Don&#039;t get distracted on food places or we will fall into another CPP trap.

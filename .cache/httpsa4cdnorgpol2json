Something isn&#039;t right. Yesterday I heard a radio announcement warning me that like next Wednesday (or around then), &quot;the white will fall&quot;. What the fuck?<br>And then this morning an army guy came to my for and said &quot;you&#039;re going to fucking die soon&quot; and then he left.

Last month, he just off and left for an entire week with his family down to Florida (or some other tropical place if you are in Florida already). Didn&#039;t say anything. I think he knows what&#039;s going to happen, and just got things mixed up and got out of town last month instead of this week. Something is definitely going to happen on Friday, I&#039;ve never been more sure of anything.<br><br>And there have been so many military exercises lately. The military base I live near has had military men and navy seals flowing in and out for the last few months, as if they&#039;re preparing for something. I went out there with my camera the other day to get evidence for the big happening on Saturday, but they wouldn&#039;t let me inside. Something big is definitely up for Sunday.<br><br>Finally though, the biggest sign that something isn&#039;t right is that earlier this week, I awoke to flashing lights and sound. Everyone shuffled out of the building, and I heard some people whispering something about an oven. Are they preparing to put us into gas chambers?<br><br>I&#039;m shaking and scared.

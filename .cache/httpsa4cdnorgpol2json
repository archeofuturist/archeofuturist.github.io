Unfortunately for you, you are a person whose genes will be erased from the rest of the gene pool, since you of your free will cannot find attraction in women. Due to this, please, despite the advice to marry a woman, do not do so. Breeding will allow for your diseased genes to be spread to your children, and they will have to suffer like you. While you will suffer, you have the power along with all the other gays to end your genetic disease, so do the world a favor and die without children.

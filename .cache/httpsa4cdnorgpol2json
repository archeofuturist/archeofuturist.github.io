Niggers in America who have some white human blood in them have an average IQ of 85 which used to be the cutoff line for mental retardation. Niggers in Africa have an average IQ of 70 which is the mental retardation line. Thus the average black African is literally retarded. In 1700 most of Africa had not invented the wheel, the alphabet or written language. Then white people came and build Africans a civilization. We built cities, skyscrapers, universities, factories, roads, bridges, churches, libraries, and houses. In 1960 when imperialists still where in Africa, Africa was 10% of world GDP, now despite comprising an exponentially larger percentage of the worlds population than it did in the 60&#039;s Africa has declined to only 4% of GDP. There are no African or Arab universities that can even compare to a low level American or European university. The few black scientists that exist will never measure up to white geniuses. Almost all of the worlds greatest minds of all time where White Western Europeans with a few Jews thrown in there. We are the master race. Niggers after having been given a civilization by us fucked it up because we left them alone with it. Niggers are useless animals that deserve to be shot.","filename":"samsung-galaxy-iii-designed-for-humans-18251835","ext":".png","w":500,"h":522,"tn_w":239,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493755329671,"time":1493755329,"md5":"t5TEre\/Z5r5EEFRlT3FP0Q==","fsize":111218,"resto":0,"id":"p5nY6fxz","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"nigger-memes","country_name":"United

Ural Muslims in cities in the Soviet era became atheists and half of the current Bashkirs, Tatars are not Muslims. And those of them who are, are either moderate villagers or urban radicals. Who calls himself a Muslim in the city, with a probability of 90% supports jihad, considers Turks and Arabs as brothers, hates atheists and Christians. Secular Islam is a myth. The Russian state is trying to construct it, but state imams do not enjoy the respect of the masses.","time":1493759478,"resto":123807169,"id":"pNCqfNSW","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":123819945,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)17:11:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123819775\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123819775<\/a><br>7 May","time":1493759479,"resto":123807169,"id":"exlIJA0E","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":123819967,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)17:11:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123819598\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123819598<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;at v\u00e6re s\u00e5 retarderet<\/span>","filename":"13a","ext":".jpg","w":680,"h":510,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1493759491753,"time":1493759491,"md5":"GMgmXKl8tv6JPddtCc9Fgg==","fsize":18411,"resto":123807169,"id":"WnVqjpf\/","country":"DK","country_name":"Denmark"},{"no":123820322,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)17:14:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123819942\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123819942<\/a><br>The state secular Islam plan must work at least partially though given how terror attacks\/p muslim are much lower in Russia than in the west?

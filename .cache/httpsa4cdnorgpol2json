You were raised to recognize something that is an ill as something that is beautiful, but don&#039;t believe that there&#039;s nothing fucking there.<br>Liberalism and religion are very similar in a sense. They&#039;re a cult of personality with the induction process written into their texts. You&#039;re special. There&#039;s a place for you here, at our school\/church. There&#039;s some great plan for you, and your real life will begin when you join our cause!<br><br>This is where dependence and ineptitude is fostered. What you do instead is you work, and you sweat, and you bleed for every hard-earned dollar. You&#039;re in Germany, so you get a useful degree first on the government&#039;s dime. You find a girl, who is sweet and receptive, with good looks, talents, and personality that you admire. You buy a house, you raise your family to be as competent as you, and that is your world&#039;s pocket of human beauty. Humanity is beautiful when it is shown how to be beautiful. <br>Your kids grow, they do the same, and they start their own families, and just like that, your life becomes a poisonous bite that courses through the shitty world to make it better. The best thing you can do, and the thing that makes society&#039;s worst people lose their fucking shit, is live a good life.","filename":"salary man","ext":".jpg","w":952,"h":1200,"tn_w":99,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490241966666,"time":1490241966,"md5":"ATrKxNl3aJNx6iLQ6alC1g==","fsize":948569,"resto":117879596,"id":"LnhoJ72g","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":117885403,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)00:14:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117883128\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117883128<\/a><br>I was full of hate and depression for the current state of civilization before pol tho","time":1490242476,"resto":117879596,"id":"DYsYpaLf","country":"AR","country_name":"Argentina"}]},{"posts":[{"no":117879010,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)23:18:31","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Concrete is cheap, why dont we have $5,000 huge houses? no mortgage","com":"Fuck the politicians n banks n insurance snakes<br><br>they all price up construction costs and union labor costs to make essiantial thing<br>the house<br>1000x more expensive than it should be<br>there is no need for a mortgage for a box designed to keep in eat and pipe out shit<br>its simple<br>its just lawyer n other commies make it regulated to hell n back with hysterial fear and thus makes it way overpriced<br>houses should go down in price each year <br>MORE people should work at factories to produce concrete and house parts<br>and work on sites making hosues with any design anyone wants<br>fuck licensing of architects who are politicians and lawyers not smart innovative engineers<br>fuck the state saying you cent build without one of the brahmin architect fags<br>fuck all that<br>let houses be liek desktop computer<br>cheaper and better and mass produced each year!","filename":"house-kern-1","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":522,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":217,"tim":1490239111729,"time":1490239111,"md5":"mgjOjDqwr3AdfLTjwekT+A==","fsize":81288,"resto":0,"id":"EasWSAPu","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"concrete-is-cheap-why-dont-we-have-5000-huge","country_name":"United States","replies":132,"images":7,"omitted_posts":127,"omitted_images":5,"tail_size":50},{"no":117885270,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)00:13:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117884703\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117884703<\/a><br>Not if there are no Jews","time":1490242416,"resto":117879010,"id":"fTvlBrQN","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117885290,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)00:13:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117879010\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117879010<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;make it regulated to hell n back<\/span><br><br>even the book of building codes is a racket<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;have to build a house to code!<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;okay so where&#039;s the code?<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;you have to buy it!!<\/span><br><br>not at all like ...<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;have to follow the laws!<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;okay so where are the laws?<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;here&#039;s are some free guides (motor vehicle laws, criminal law, tax laws, etc) and the rest are online!<\/span>","filename":"1426201289396","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":461,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":96,"tim":1490242424394,"time":1490242424,"md5":"kkpgppXtfRDv88SSEnYsYQ==","fsize":132781,"resto":117879010,"id":"W8XTCDCD","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117885303,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)00:13:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117885008\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117885008<\/a><br>How is that good","time":1490242430,"resto":117879010,"id":"6OddtKed","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":117885305,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)00:13:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"I live in Colorado, which has been booming with new construction for a while now<br><br>we have construction defect laws that are fairly strict-- you have six years to discover a defect, and two years after that to sue. but the housing here is being thrown up so fast that anything built in this century I would never buy. its the price paid when you hire a mexican crew and tell them to show up one day to put siding on a condo complex. they show up, there&#039;s no vapor wrap or insulation put up first, but they go ahead and do their job anyway. congrats... two years later you have mold. <br><br>There are groups here advocating that all construction defect laws be changed, so much so that you cannot sue at all for construction defects on new builds.

IN TRUTH I WAS VISITING THE BIG APPLE, SO AS TO COMPARE MY GARGANTUAN MEAT TRAIN TO IT AND LAUGH AT THE GASPING NEW YORKERS AS I POUNDED THEIR BELOVED NAMESAKE INTO BIG APPLE SAUCE. HAVING NOT GOTTEN RELEASE FROM MY CULINARY EXERCISE, I MEANDERED DOWN THE STREET WITH MY VITAL BLOOD ENGORGED SEWER PIPE OUT IN FRONT OF ME LIKE A BLIND MAN&#039;S CANE, LOOKING FOR A HOLE IN THE BACK SIDE OF A WOMAN WHICH I WOULD STRETCH BEYOND HUMAN LIMITS. I SPOTTED AT THAT VERY MOMENT AN ATTRACTIVE FEMALE IN A MINISKIRT WAVING AT ME. I SLAPPED HER TO THE GROUND WITH MY ENORMOUS PHALLUS AND QUICKLY RAVISHED HER SKIRT LIKE A STARVED DOG ON A BABY MADE OF STEAK. THE SIGHT THAT AWAITED BOTH SHOCKED AND ENRAGED ME. AFTER SEEING THIS &quot;WOMAN&#039;S&quot; RAISIN SIZED WINKY WINKLER,I VOMITED DOWN HIS THROAT THEN PENETRATED HIS ESOPHAGUS, RIPPED OUT HIS SPINE AND PEELED HIS CORPSE FROM MY MONEYMAKER. TO TEACH ALL OF NEW YORK A LESSON FOR LETTING THIS FLAMING FAG BAG LIVE, I LET LOOSE A SEMENAL FLOOD OF BIBLICAL PROPORTIONS UPON THE TOWERS OF TWO (AT WHOM&#039;S SMALL SIZE I LAUGHED LIKE A CLOWN RAPING AN 8 YEAR OLD), WHICH CAUSED THEM TO COME CRASHING DOWN LIKE ME AFTER A WEEKEND METH BINGE. I MOCKED THE NEW YORKERS AND MADE nigga JOKES AS THEY RAN FROM MY EVER EXPANDING CLOUD OF SPERMAZOA, MASTURBATING TO THE LOOKS OF HORROR ON THEIR FACES. THE GOVERNMENT, IN AN ATTEMPT TO SAVE FACE AND BECAUSE THEY HATE ARABS MORE THAN JEWS, PAINTED A BOEING 767 ON MY GIGANTIC COCK AND CALLED IT A TERRORIST ATTACK. THE FEELING OF PAINTBRUSHES ON MY DICK MADE ME COME AGAIN, AND PRESIDENT BUSH SNORTED UP EVERY DROP BECAUSE HE THOUGHT IT WAS COKE.

The chances of Europeans coming here might become easier. I was wondering to any Euroanons interested in the idea of moving to the US but can&#039;t. If Bannon and a Sessions make this happen during Trump&#039;s presidency are you considering moving? I&#039;d recommend suburban band rural areas. The thought of Euroanons coming to America under trump rather then Third Worlders could make us retain our population, bonus if we raise birth rates as well.<br><br>What&#039;s your thoughts on this \/pol\/ specifically Euroanons?","filename":"IMG_7744","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":480,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1491767254039,"time":1491767254,"md5":"lU5sLi2uQnQBQvsaX3OhXg==","fsize":62898,"resto":0,"id":"qebFhY\/Y","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"european-immigration-to-the-us","country_name":"United States","replies":201,"images":30,"omitted_posts":196,"omitted_images":30,"tail_size":50},{"no":120352208,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)18:57:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120326334\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120326334<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Poles,Ukranians<\/span><br>You mean White Europeans who aren&#039;t complete cowards and social cucks?

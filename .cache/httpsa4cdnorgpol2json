The defense for them all is the same. <br><br>My blood boiled the hottest back when we had an immigration center worker who got stabbed to death by a refugee and our chief of police is on the morning TV shows saying &quot;yes it&#039;s tragic BUT&quot; and then goes on for several minutes about what the poor boy must have been through to make him so violent.<br><br>Yes, two seconds on the actual dead girl, and several minutes of compassion for the murderer. The murderer who was later shown to be lying about his age (claimed 16, found to be &quot;at least 18&quot; - more likely mid 20s). He also had no legal right to stay. <br><br>The police chief was not fired, is still in charge, hasn&#039;t apologized or changed.","time":1493094574,"resto":122682317,"id":"n+1vdKm3","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"}]},{"posts":[{"no":122688629,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)23:53:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"Is this a meme or can racist white men still be attracted to black women?","filename":"IMG_3639","ext":".jpg","w":1262,"h":1295,"tn_w":243,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493092414190,"time":1493092414,"md5":"qXLTlaAoHkZY+EMXR4LQ+Q==","fsize":356518,"resto":0,"id":"RepCOyif","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"is-this-a-meme-or-can-racist-white-men-still-be","country_name":"United States","replies":47,"images":15,"omitted_posts":42,"omitted_images":14},{"no":122692003,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)00:28:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122691469\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122691469<\/a><br>post timestamp and tits, I have a 60k a year job and plenty of savings, I just need you to be loyal and at least a 7\/10 to qualify, also wanting 2 kids and be a damn good mother","filename":"1491117953793","ext":".jpg","w":680,"h":1304,"tn_w":65,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493094498761,"time":1493094498,"md5":"lNRgDj+j2jZLG4HQCr2YFw==","fsize":535219,"resto":122688629,"id":"hYgcM798","country":"AU","m_img":1,"country_name":"Australia"},{"no":122692037,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)00:28:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122691810\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122691810<\/a><br>Why is success god digging?

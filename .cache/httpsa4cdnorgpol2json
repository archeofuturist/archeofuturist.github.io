Trump&#039;s campaign was EXPLICITLY isolationist. AMERICA FIRST. In his inaugural address, Trump said every decision he made would be with AMERICA FIRST in mind. In what warped dimension does attacking the Syrian Air Force constitute a benefit to America? Assad was fighting ISIS. How does this do anything but weaken his efforts? If he is ousted, I have no doubt ISIS will seize power.<br><br>And why? Because Trump saw some &quot;dead&quot; kids on TV? How does that effect America at all? It&#039;s RETARDED. How can anyone in their right mind support this decision? How is this anything but the penultimate tear in the quickly unraveling canvas of international relations?<br><br>I honestly can&#039;t believe Trump went back on such a huge campaign promise. He was supposed to make friends with Russia and keep his nose out of the business of other sovereign nations. He rightly shamed Hillary for going into Afghanistan and Iraq, and now (as soon as Kushner replaced Bannon) he&#039;s playing into the hands of the neo-cons.<br><br>I honestly can&#039;t believe this, and if he continues to foolishly destabilize the Middle East, I will not be voting for the Republicans in the midterms, and I will not be voting for Trump in 2020.","filename":"3mLydMU","ext":".png","w":243,"h":200,"tn_w":243,"tn_h":200,"tim":1491569856554,"time":1491569856,"md5":"vO5D1RuRoSWSzB+H5CV4nw==","fsize":71580,"resto":0,"id":"chuxNZPf","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"trump-should-have-stayed-the-fuck-out-of-syria","country_name":"United States","replies":219,"images":39,"omitted_posts":214,"omitted_images":39,"tail_size":50},{"no":119961274,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)10:57:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119960848\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119960848<\/a><br>Yeah I will.

I support Trump not because he&#039;s Trump, but because every move he makes throws a monkey wrench into the globalist&#039;s plans. This stunt with Syria is no different, it is a calculated, precise blow that no one, was expecting.<br><br>In one blow, Trump has castrated the mainstream media&#039;s narrative, taken the moral high ground in the eyes of normies, pacified the neoconservatives, and destroyed Obama&#039;s limp-wristed foreign policy.<br><br>This is an unprecedented controversy. Trump thrives on controversy, and the media is making a fool of themselves trying to spin it negatively, while simultaneously dialing back on their resist Trump stance to avoid losing face. Even CNN is lauding Trump for this.<br><br>Trump knows the Syrian gas attacks were a false flag. He&#039;s called the globalist&#039;s bluff, and he&#039;s called it in the best possible way.<br><br>Trump is a businessman, he knows that to negotiate effectively, you need leverage. This stunt in Syria, is the leverage we need. This has thrown the globalist cabal into disarray, shattered the anti-Trump narrative, and proved that Trump has the cajones to follow up on what he&#039;s said.<br><br>He&#039;s not going to escalate with Syria, he knows that would be his end, this was a one time deal. He appears to have attacked Russia by proxy, Putin is an intelligent man, a friend of Trump, and a nationalist to the core, he knows what Trump is doing, and he&#039;s playing along.<br><br>In short, Trump has shattered the foundation of the globalist propaganda machine, and it&#039;s only a matter of time before the rest comes tumbling down. The effects of the Syrian bombing will echo for weeks to come, and when the dust settles, Trump, and by extension, the United States of America, will be all stronger for it.","filename":"462 (1)","ext":".jpg","w":646,"h":720,"tn_w":224,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491575296850,"time":1491575296,"md5":"k4J0MIP+PIZU76amWhanFg==","fsize":89499,"resto":0,"id":"OFLprVPm","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"pol-calm-yourselves","country_name":"United States","replies":47,"images":11,"omitted_posts":42,"omitted_images":10},{"no":119961321,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)10:58:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119956290\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119956290<\/a>","filename":"1488977982224","ext":".jpg","w":647,"h":706,"tn_w":114,"tn_h":124,"tim":1491577090730,"time":1491577090,"md5":"+8tJSyuWZA3zgaKCa7BBEg==","fsize":86608,"resto":119956290,"id":"Fpk+Cymm","country":"JP","country_name":"Japan"},{"no":119961406,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)10:58:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119961179\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119961179<\/a><br>More debt, more money printing.

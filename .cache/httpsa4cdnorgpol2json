She struggles with narcissistic personality disorder as a result of abuse in childhood. Molyneux tried to help her, but in the end her vanity triumphed over philosophy. Colleen couldn\u2019t accept that Molyneux had started a movement that was bigger than her, and felt heartbroken if he didn\u2019t respond to her skype messages.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;After the breakup, she hoped to attract a new male and was having trouble without the use of makeup. She has struggled with acne and feels insecure if people can see it. Colleen now applies a thick layer of foundation, nearly as thick as her false self.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In a Freedomain Radio podcast on sibling abuse, Colleen says that both she and her brother Edward Cowgill were physically abused as children. Though, she was considered the favorite child and thus received less abuse than her brother. Her parents, Keith and Mary Cowgill, are irrational, mystic, Christians. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Colleen believes she was molested as an infant or toddler and that her parents kept this a secret, hoping she would forget. She believes this caused all manner of degeneracy and promiscuous behavior at much too young of age. She sent naked photographs to boys at as early as 14. She had sex with a 20 year old male when she was only 15.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;As a result of rejecting philosophy, Colleen is now stuck in perpetual adolescence. She\u2019s almost 30 and still childless and in college. As was predicted by DeFOO.org years ago, she has broken up with her fiance Courtney Hunter. Now she smugly brags about her new non-white boyfriend.

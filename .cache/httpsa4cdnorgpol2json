Why would (((they))) make things up?<\/span><br><br>&quot;No decision which I have had to make during the course of this war was graver than that to attack Russia. I had always maintained that we ought at all costs to avoid waging war on two fronts, and you may rest assured that I pondered long and anxiously over Napoleon and his experiences in Russia. Why, then, you may ask, this war against Russia, and why at the time that I selected?<br>...<br>Our one and only chance of vanquishing Russia was to take the initiative, for to fight a defensive war against her was not practical. We dared not allow the Red Army the advantage of the terrain, place our Autobahns at the disposal of its swiftly on-rushing armour, and our railways at the disposal of its troops and its supplies. But if we took the offensive, we could, indeed, defeat the Red Army on its own ground, in the swamps and in the vast and muddy expanses; but in a civilized country we could not have done so. We should simply have been providing it with a springboard with which to leap upon the whole of Europe and destroy it.<br><br>Why 1941? Because, in view of the steadily increasing power of our western enemies, if we were to act at all, we had to do so with the least possible delay. Nor, mind you, was Stalin doing nothing. On two fronts, time was against us. The real question was not, therefore: `Why 22 June 1941 already&#039; but rather: `Why not earlier still?&#039; But for the difficulties created for us by the Italians and their idiotic campaign in Greece, I should have attacked Russia a few weeks earlier. For us, the main problem was to keep the Russians from moving for as long as possible, and my own personal nightmare was the fear that Stalin might take the initiative before me.&quot; - Adolf Hitler, Political Testament, February 15th, 1945","time":1493678646,"resto":123673177,"id":"bPMdbraD","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123685483,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)18:44:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123685125\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123685125<\/a><br>Yes, and one of those countries had the political agenda to place a particular group of people into gas chambers, concentration camps and firing squads.

If they leave we call in the military to take it back. Sanctuary cities are the beginning of ignoring federal rule. But I was always pro states rights so I could care less as long as they don&#039;t leave. Texas should be the only state legally capable of leaving but even then illegal. We fought and joined on our own free will. Our free will, will no doubt allow Texas to leave peacefully. No other state can truly say the same. California and New York would be the toughest to take back. But they wouldn&#039;t leave if we deported all their illegals. Some rebellion would last but be put down quickly via the military and national guard. Commies don&#039;t have public support for guerilla campaigns except for cali n new york.

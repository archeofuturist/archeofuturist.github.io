For some dropout living in the sticks, he might be able to &quot;survive&quot; on 15k a year.<br><br>All this talk of &quot;minimums&quot; does is drive young people and uneducated people out of the workforce. If I can&#039;t hire someone for under 50k a year, I&#039;m sure as fuck not going to hire high school students to do easy jobs ever. Instead, I&#039;ll hire an adult and require he do the labor of 5 high school students. He&#039;ll be miserable, the students will be fucked, but you lefties will feel like the world is somehow a better place because someone is getting paid &quot;a living wage.&quot;<br><br>I know, it&#039;s your wet dream to flip burgers for 100k a year. But that&#039;s never how the world is going to work. If you want things, you will and should, have to work for them. And if you want nice things you&#039;re going to have to better yourself through education and experience to get them.<br><br>Entry level minimum wage jobs are for high school students and other low\/no skilled workers. They&#039;re not intended to be jobs for heads of households. If you&#039;ve managed to start a family and need your McJob to provide for them you&#039;re already a miserable failure. You should put your kids in foster care while you attempt to turn your life around through vocational school (often free with government financial aid) or get an actual job.","time":1492055941,"resto":120860170,"id":"IqMtJh74","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120863528,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)23:59:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120863376\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120863376<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;proud of making a ton of wealth for somebody else<\/span><br><br>C U C K E D<br><br>U <br><br>C<br><br>K<br><br>E<br><br>D","time":1492055971,"resto":120860170,"id":"moD9vpEb","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":120834261,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)20:03:40","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Nuke sub confirmed?","com":"Uh guys....what the hell is going on","filename":"what_wtf","ext":".png","w":1674,"h":853,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":127,"tim":1492041820206,"time":1492041820,"md5":"VUPCEa3S1YEVae7gQiUW7Q==","fsize":342998,"resto":0,"id":"5YOd\/IOp","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"nuke-sub-confirmed","country_name":"United States","replies":186,"images":41,"omitted_posts":181,"omitted_images":40,"tail_size":50},{"no":120861116,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)23:35:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120835174\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120835174<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The aircraft&#039;s sensors are primarily intended for anti-submarine warfare<\/span><br><br>Holy shit","filename":"Screenshot_2017-04-12-20-34-23","ext":".png","w":1440,"h":2560,"tn_w":70,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492054536715,"time":1492054536,"md5":"pMKGkCydGq5tUNqqYaNsxw==","fsize":419868,"resto":120834261,"id":"FgjPVeUI","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120861142,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)23:35:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120834261\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120834261<\/a><br><br>military is trying to use meme magic to find nuke subs","time":1492054556,"resto":120834261,"id":"Ivv1GuYS","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120861784,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)23:42:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"Uh g guys?

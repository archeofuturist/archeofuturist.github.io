(((Ileana Ros-Lehtinen))) of Florida blasted President Donald Trump\u2019s chief strategist Stephen Bannon Friday, referring to the senior adviser as \u201ca negative distraction and a controversial character\u201d and calling for his removal from the administration.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Ros-Lehtinen praised the president\u2019s decision to remove Bannon from the National Security Council earlier in the week, taking her criticisms of the top administration official a step further during a radio interview with WIOD-AM (610). \u201cI think his days are numbered in that administration. And I think profound changes will be coming,\u201d she said<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Ros-Lehtinen, who sits on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, argued Bannon\u2019s tendency to favor isolationist policy doesn\u2019t reflect the county\u2019s values. \u201cHis views are not in line with our country,\u201dshe continued. \u201cWe are an inclusive country that welcomes different points of views. His ties to certain groups are very worrisome.\u201d<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Some speculate Bannon\u2019s removal from the NSC, which was orchestrated by national security adviser H.R. McMaster made, signals he is losing influence within the White House. Rumors of a shakeup in administration staff have been stirring, with administration officials telling The Wall Street Journal Trump is growing frustrated with the in-fighting between his staff.<\/span><br><br>https:\/\/archive.fo\/tLbBD","filename":"hpy-09uji","ext":".png","w":930,"h":932,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":249,"tim":1491663580691,"time":1491663580,"md5":"2GAJHR+a0y2V1fArnP+06w==","fsize":349722,"resto":0,"id":"YXrP0YaP","country":"NL","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-kikes-are-trying-to-get-bannon-ousted","country_name":"Netherlands","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":120129401,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)09:08:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"1. country you hate the most<br>2. why","filename":"200372355","ext":".jpg","w":540,"h":742,"tn_w":181,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491656931043,"time":1491656931,"md5":"P2LiBZxDhfWhU65AWpW44g==","fsize":75309,"resto":0,"id":"ZQQNGWpR","country":"KR","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"1-country-you-hate-the-most","country_name":"South Korea","replies":247,"images":50,"omitted_posts":242,"omitted_images":49,"tail_size":50},{"no":120140009,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)10:57:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120129473\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120129473<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;10.4% Irish<\/span><br>Jesus Christ how horrifying","time":1491663426,"resto":120129401,"id":"rsTv\/oci","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120140018,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)10:57:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120138383\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120138383<\/a><br>How do I upvote?","time":1491663434,"resto":120129401,"id":"b1g\/WSg+","country":"PT","country_name":"Portugal"},{"no":120140078,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)10:57:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120130277\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120130277<\/a><br>England is literally poorer than our poorest state (Mississippi).

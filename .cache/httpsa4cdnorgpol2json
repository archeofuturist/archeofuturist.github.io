But now a research team out of the University of Toronto Mississauga (Ashlyn Swift-Gallant, Lindsay A. Coome, D. Ashley Monks, and Doug P. VanderLaan) has investigated variation within the population of gay men based on their anal-sex roles (that is bottom, or receptive, top, or penetrative, and versatile, or both receptive and penetrative depending on circumstance). The results of two of their studies suggest there very well could be biological subgroups of gay men, which is to say that one\u2019s biological makeup could possibly (and most likely, indirectly) influence whether or not he likes to fuck or get fucked (or both).<br><br>When it has been studied, anal-sex role has been viewed as a result of social factors (more on that in a minute). Despite every study I\u2019ve read that asks about the anal-sex role of its respondents has found that the majority men who have sex with men identify as versatile (including the two studies at hand from the University of Toronto team) as well as my own anecdotal experience suggesting as much, the top\/bottom binary persists in gay culture. It comes with predictable cultural baggage for those who firmly fit on either pole (pun intended\u2014but only for the bottoms). Tops are stereotyped as masculine, taking up the male tradition of putting their dicks in things, while bottoms are regarded as more feminine (despite the overwhelming evidence to the contrary in porn, and the preponderance of self-identified \u201cmasc bottoms\u201d in sex-app profiles). And with the assumptions of femininity in men come insults (\u201cbottom\u201d as a pejorative amongst gay men) and with those come a specific kind of shame in addition to the shame many gay men already experience merely living in a heterosexual world.","filename":"Screen Shot 2017-05-01 at 10.35.26 AM","ext":".png","w":1614,"h":1304,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":201,"tim":1493649500638,"time":1493649500,"md5":"s+KviB5VfcUMCUYUQRA9Aw==","fsize":2152567,"resto":0,"id":"h24dVcRW","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"science-proves-being-gay-is-genetic","country_name":"United States","replies":92,"images":11,"omitted_posts":87,"omitted_images":10},{"no":123631242,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)11:12:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123628561\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123628561<\/a><br>The everyone who disagrees with homosexuality is gay meme.

I used to play this crappy text based role playing game that was like 80% women - all around the same time that the trans fad swept across tumblr there was a sort of domino effect where every other chick suddenly decided that their depression was caused by being the wrong gender. Some would just do the thing where a girl cuts her hair short, wears men&#039;s clothes and changes their profile gender to snowflake but others actually started taking hormones and some went as far as getting their boobs surgically removed. I spent a lot of time in the game because Im a depressed NEET and it was almost frightening how many of them would suddenly one day tell me to consider that my depression was due to me possibly being the wrong gender... it&#039;s like a mental illness wrapped in a fad but instead of cutting and putting the pictures on MySpace like emos or wearing dog collars and studded hot topic pants like goths in the past youth today are jumping the hormone-injection\/new-pronouns-ever<wbr>y-day bandwagon.","time":1493651617,"resto":123627464,"id":"Q2ZJMPuC","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123631390,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)11:14:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123630984\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123630984<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Late Rome<\/span><br><br>That&#039;s right.

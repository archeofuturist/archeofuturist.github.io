That&#039;s why women rely more on instinct and emotion, rather than logic or reason. That also explains women&#039;s relative lack of intellectual accomplishments or invention over the past 3,000 years (and more). The female gender&#039;s main contributions have been singing, giving birth, cooking and cleaning, and even then the world class chef are men, make up artist men, hairstylist also men. Vocalist are males too. They even suck at giving birth. Look at the high infant mortality rate and mothers dying from child birth, before modern procedures pioneer by males. Try giving birth with the help of a midwife. LOL<br> Nearly everything women have accomplished is with help from men or from a group of men. Women deserve no rights infact It has been proven our ancestors were right in caging their women. History only teaches us what to do. Some of us ignored it and allowed feminism to exist, but that is soon going to change and you can already see an Awakening against it around the western world. The rest of the planet still treats women like inferior beings, which is how they must be treated to keep a society stable. I mean, The so called capable women can&#039;t even compete with normal qualified men in any field without gender quotas and help. Let&#039;s ignore sports, which all real world records are maintained by men. I suppose you assume you are on the same level mentally. Wrong, any kind of mental sports are also dominated by men. Look at the long list of world class surgeons, artist, engineer. How many are women? Funny how modern neuroscience disprove dualism yet people still believe men and women&#039;s brain capacity are the somehow on the same level. Oh wait it&#039;s because they have been brainwashed into thinking the subhumans known as females and men are somehow equal.

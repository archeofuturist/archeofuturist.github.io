But on July 2, that came silently to an end with the implementation of a new reform passed in January. The result: an unleashing of thousands of hours per week of government-funded radio and TV programs for domestic U.S. consumption in a reform initially criticized as a green light for U.S. domestic propaganda efforts. So what just happened?<br><br>Until this month, a vast ocean of U.S. programming produced by the Broadcasting Board of Governors such as Voice of America, Radio Free Europe\/Radio Liberty, and the Middle East Broadcasting Networks could only be viewed or listened to at broadcast quality in foreign countries. The programming varies in tone and quality, but its breadth is vast: It\u2019s viewed in more than 100 countries in 61 languages. The topics covered include human rights abuses in Iran, self-immolation in Tibet, human trafficking across Asia, and on-the-ground reporting in Egypt and Iraq. <br><br>http:\/\/foreignpolicy.com\/2013\/07\/14<wbr>\/u-s-repeals-propaganda-ban-spreads<wbr>-government-made-news-to-americans\/<wbr><br><br>The CIA was doing this shit with Operation Mockingbird","time":1493156500,"resto":122782545,"id":"\/68jRA7y","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122792063,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)17:41:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122791818\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122791818<\/a><br>Depends on country.How about chinese factory kids?

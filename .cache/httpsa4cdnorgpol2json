I considered myself to be on the left but the more I see the angrier I get. I thought my social circle agreed, we all seemed to be on the board of &quot;these crazy liberals are insane&quot; and all that. But what just happened is so utterly stupid that I can&#039;t associate with liberals anymore.<br><br>Note: I&#039;m the only white guy in the group.<br><br>In our facebook group chat, I had set the theme to Overwatch like a month ago. I just picked the names of people based on their favorite characters\/who fit them the best. Everyone was chill but this one whale girl gets all mad and says I&#039;m being racist. (She&#039;s white but because she&#039;s like 1\/4 burrito she thinks she can get all offended) I didn&#039;t base anyone off of race. No one shared the same race of their characters. But she goes off and I&#039;m just like &quot;sorry lol&quot;<br><br>Today, she changes the theme to be named after people in another class. I got named after this crazy black kid who wants to kill all nonblacks in the name of his religion or whatever. I noticed this and I said &quot;why am I the guy no one likes?&quot; So the whale goes on again about how &quot;its no big deal, its just nicknames, they don&#039;t matter.&quot; I remind her how the &quot;OW names clearly mattered to you.&quot; She starts going off saying &quot;DON&#039;T COME AT ME.&quot; I start saying it&#039;s no big deal and I don&#039;t care about my nickname, I just wanted to know why I got stuck with the crazy kid. So the whale and another girl start going off calling me racist (despite the 2nd girl saying she was okay with the OW thing) and start listing off people who thought my nicknames were racist and how I&#039;m &quot;clearly showing my privilege by acknowledging the names&quot;. I get pissed and leave.<br><br>They seriously got triggered over nicknames?

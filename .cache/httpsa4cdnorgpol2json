The insurer is basically betting on your healthcare costing less than your premium over your lifetime. If fatties have lower lifetime healthcare costs _____________ (fill the blank).<br><br>Protip: the right answer is that their premiums can theoretically be lower than healthy people and still be profitable because their lifetime healthcare costs are statistically lower.<br><br>HOWEVER, this would require the fatty to be with the insurer their entire life. That&#039;s pretty unlikely, and the chance of any one insurer getting suddenly stuck with a high bill on a new fat customer is potentially higher than healthy people. This can be factored in with a joining fee or whatever, and isn&#039;t unique to fatties. As healthy people get older the same applies - and the switching fee would need to be proportionately higher because they are proportionately more expensive.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Their cost to the government is different, less obvious, answer.<\/span><br>Only because you are obfuscating it to avoid being wrong.<br><br>Fatties cost less in health care and therefore should pay less for their healthcare.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;but muh cost to society<\/span><br>That&#039;s not at issue here. The question is posed about healthcare. If you want to talk about societal burden then that is a HUGE discussion in which fat people are a TINY part. A fatty who works is a far smaller drain than a permanent NEET or a mentally ill person. Why should the fatty be taxed more for being LESS USELESS than a NEET (who receives bennies) or a mentally ill person who can&#039;t work at all and is therefore impossible to punish with taxes?<br><br>You&#039;re basically saying everyone less useful than a fatty should be sent to gulags to have their obligations extracted from them.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;fat is a choice<\/span><br>So are a lot of things far more crippling than obesity.

This is just not true. Jew semantics have convinced people that are for all intents and purposes slaves, that they are free, simply by loading the word &quot;slavery&quot;, and then isolating it in the modern lexicon, the vast majority of slaves don&#039;t even realize they&#039;re slaves simply because they are not called such. The Jew has perfected slavery, and there are different levels of slavery. I&#039;m essentially a modern day slave. If you do not own land, or are not self employed, you too are a slave. Perhaps slavery just means not having any expendable income, whatever it means it is still with us, that I know to be true. Maybe the prison industrial complex is the closest approximation, it certainly is demographically. You may be a rich slave, but you are still a slave.

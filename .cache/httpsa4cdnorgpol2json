You might even make some friends<br><br>The march is at auburn TOMORROW TUESDAY APRIL 18th. come by 5pm because parking will be crazy<br><br>So here are some ground rules to keep people safe and on message.<br><br>1. Do not dress in black. tactical mistake. That is the garb of communists. Wear whatever you can protest in comfortably. Business casual is fine. Ballcap (trumphat) and sunglasses are fine. Masks are okay but that will make you look like antifa. Skull cawadoody ghost masks are fine. Bring helmets if you want to be a badass (also safer)<br><br>2. No guns. Yes alabama is a progun state. But guns are not allowed on college campuses. Leave your gun at home. There will likely be fights. Boys will have your back at all times. A shooting justified or not will hurt everything we are trying to do.<br><br>3. No crazy signs. Memes are fine. But try to keep it topical to free speech on colleges , anti communism , and anti antifa. Stuff that people will see on the news and agree with.<br><br>4. Bring medical supplies to help your friends out. Stuff like gauze and whole milk for pepper spray (and chugging infront of minorities). baking soda and water is great for pepper spray too. So is maalox. If you want to go full prepper and bring your EMS bag its up to you.<br><br>5. Have fun, bring\/make friends, and get phone numbers.

Most women don&#039;t care about morals at all, especially if a guy is rich or powerful or strong. That&#039;s why you see so many women standing by cheaters who are powerful or rich or super strong (even guys who beat them, even convicted criminals).<br><br>Women really do believe that might makes right, and that weakness is pathetic.<br><br>Male motivations are related to biology. Men prefer youth and beauty and submissiveness, signs of fertility and signs that that fertility will lead to children.

If a guy is hopping from woman to woman he doesn&#039;t feel abandoned, he&#039;s doing the abandoning.<br><br>It&#039;s natural for a man to expect his mate to be a virgin. She&#039;ll have less diseases. She&#039;ll be more loyal. She&#039;ll probably be younger. All motivated by biology. If he settles for less, his choice may be very costly, he may get a disease, he may have expended lots of resources on a woan for nothing, she may be older and therefore have more mutations in her eggs, etc.<br><br>The traditional way of doing things evolved because it works.

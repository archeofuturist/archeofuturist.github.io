I Grew up with king james and the reason im asking this is sorta a i guess a spiritual awaking in a sense. When coming Across the story Jesus and the woman taken in adultery in Gospel of John 7:53-8:1. This is a good story but im gona focus on one part in particular When the Pharisee come to jesus and request that jesus bring judgement jesus instead. Gets down in sand in starts drawing but the bible doesn&#039;t tell us what he&#039;s drawing and this leads me to my point.<br><br>People have tried to make sense of what jesus was drawing in the sand that day. Some say it was the tend commandments, others say that jesus was writing out the sins of the Pharisee in the sands. But desu im kinda of the belief that if the bible didn&#039;t tell us we shouldn&#039;t speculate. Can anyone else relate? The idea that the more men temper with things it becomes more corrupted? That&#039;s why i only read the king james version and my being 20 i&#039;ll be honest. It&#039;s hard at time to read the bible especially with it being in paraphrases. But their is a reason jesus says more or less he does this to attract true believers. Can anyone else relate to this in their life someone possibly older with life experience ?","filename":"king james bible","ext":".jpg","w":1240,"h":1595,"tn_w":194,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492224219241,"time":1492224219,"md5":"A2umDADUMmMOS\/bFL+Ev7A==","fsize":202289,"resto":0,"id":"sr8Fs2hn","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"what-version-do-you-read-pol","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0},{"no":121157036,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)22:44:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121156879\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121156879<\/a><br>Sorry, not into ancient Jew books.","time":1492224288,"resto":121156879,"id":"CawLmX3a","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":121149268,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)21:42:19","name":"Anonymous","sub":"WILL THE LIVESTREAM GET NUKED?","com":"Will you witness a live nuking of norks? get on livestream boiz<br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=hBM<wbr>zXkZzlNM","filename":"Screen Shot 2017-04-15 at 5.26.41","ext":".png","w":1226,"h":960,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":195,"tim":1492220539254,"time":1492220539,"md5":"gbmqsOgTRYNpBdtwuaQYtQ==","fsize":1086289,"resto":0,"id":"9+7Pgbv6","country":"GE","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"will-the-livestream-get-nuked","country_name":"Georgia","replies":36,"images":9,"omitted_posts":31,"omitted_images":8},{"no":121156392,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)22:39:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121156235\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121156235<\/a><br>i&#039;m pretty sure this is all their military is used for","time":1492223997,"resto":121149268,"id":"A\/RYOII2","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121156533,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)22:41:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121156235\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121156235<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;can only see one set of legs when they cross right in front of the camera<\/span>","filename":"e28","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":576,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":120,"tim":1492224062035,"time":1492224062,"md5":"2SFmimi35X+eLzl+eeFyzw==","fsize":54516,"resto":121149268,"id":"fnRfLsf2","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121156621,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)22:41:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121149268\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121149268<\/a><br>there is only one word to describe this parade; gay","time":1492224098,"resto":121149268,"id":"imdeN8dP","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121156635,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)22:41:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"TFW you can watch a ceremony where your entire military goes by and you have to face America later that night.","filename":"sadpepe","ext":".jpg","w":201,"h":250,"tn_w":100,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492224108642,"time":1492224108,"md5":"J8tqrBM6h2jnYu3TVOHwcA==","fsize":9030,"resto":121149268,"id":"+9sfr+RN","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121157035,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)22:44:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"YO THAT SHIT IS 3D TECHNOLOGY BLUE BEAM<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;YO THAT SHIT IS 3D TECHNOLOGY BLUE BEAM<\/span><br>YO THAT SHIT IS 3D TECHNOLOGY BLUE BEAM<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;YO THAT SHIT IS 3D TECHNOLOGY BLUE BEAM<\/span><br>YO THAT SHIT IS 3D TECHNOLOGY BLUE BEAM<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;YO THAT SHIT IS 3D TECHNOLOGY BLUE BEAM<\/span><br>YO THAT SHIT IS 3D TECHNOLOGY BLUE BEAM<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;YO THAT SHIT IS 3D TECHNOLOGY BLUE BEAM<\/span>","filename":"1490908393136","ext":".jpg","w":320,"h":320,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492224287898,"time":1492224287,"md5":"S9JmfGpAoOwtpGhzw40kdA==","fsize":16658,"resto":121149268,"id":"7OMO3qKT","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":121152442,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)22:08:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"The US has no right to demand NK decommission its nukes unless the US also decommissions its nukes.

HUGE NASA COVERUP!","com":"NASA has built a device, an Artificial Sun\/Simulator Reflector and placed it heliosynchronis in orbit outside the Earth&#039;s Atmosphere. NASA technology is very highly advanced and they are able to cloak (hide) objects in outer space including our Solar Sun. Our Solar Sun is not white but yellow in its appearance. The device is about the size of a football field that unfolded after being launch into space. It is white and very very bright. Because the device is so close to the Earth and infront of our Solar Sun it is cloaking (hiding) our Solar Sun. It also bends light like a Prism and here is how to prove it. If you follow this procedure you will see both suns (Our Solar Sun and the Artificial Sun) at the same time. You will need two (2) pairs of UV Sunglasses. UV Sunglasses with a upper tinted lenses work excellent. 1.) Place 1 pair of sunglasses on and close 1 eye. 2.)WHILE LOOKING AT THE SUN, hold the other pair of sunglasses 10 inches in front of the other pair (look on the upper tinted area of the lense). Slowly bring the second pair closer towards your face like a telescope. You will see two suns. 1 sun will be bright white; that is the Artificial Sun\/Simulator Reflector. The other sun, which is our Solar Sun will not be as bright and will appear to be a different color depending on the tinted color on the sunglass lense. Our Solar Sun is 93 Million Miles behind the device. If you do this technique correctly, you will see two suns WITH YOUR OWN EYES; the Artificial Sun and our Solar Sun.

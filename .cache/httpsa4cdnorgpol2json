In the United Kingdom, these dogs were used in blood sports such as bull-baiting and bear-baiting. These blood sports were officially eliminated in 1835 as Britain began to introduce animal welfare laws. Since dogfights were cheaper to organize and far easier to conceal from the law than bull or bear baits, blood sport proponents turned to pitting their dogs against each other instead. Dog fighting was used as both a blood sport (often involving gambling) and a way to continue to test the quality of their stock. For decades afterwards, dog fighting clandestinely took place in small areas of Britain and America. In the early 20th century pit bulls were used as catch dogs in America for semi-wild cattle and hogs, to hunt, and drive livestock, and as family companions. Some have been selectively bred for their fighting prowess.","filename":"pitbull2","ext":".jpg","w":220,"h":126,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":71,"tim":1492790391521,"time":1492790391,"md5":"EmFnfRBNiDnnc\/pibSd+DA==","fsize":13054,"resto":122143173,"id":"\/bmhdfo6","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":122142120,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)10:39:28","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Daily Reminder","com":"That \/pol\/ always was, still is, and always will be a Christian board and that \/r\/atheism and the &quot;pagan&quot; runoff from the LARP.com forums will be the first to go come the Day of the Crusades.","filename":"download","ext":".jpg","w":225,"h":225,"tn_w":225,"tn_h":225,"tim":1492785568171,"time":1492785568,"md5":"1oWPvmdt2ehAxFUrfS\/LFg==","fsize":10691,"resto":0,"id":"qF3Jth6Y","country":"IL","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"daily-reminder","country_name":"Israel","replies":41,"images":12,"omitted_posts":36,"omitted_images":10},{"no":122149166,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)11:46:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122148609\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122148609<\/a><br><br>the real Christianism is Catholicism you little dummy<br><br>embrace God, accept the pope.","time":1492789576,"resto":122142120,"id":"53Qxvlkk","country":"PE","country_name":"Peru"},{"no":122149311,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)11:47:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122147501\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122147501<\/a><br>Must be the Presbyterians or something.

This thread is dedicated to discussion of the religion of Islam. <br><br>Islam is more than just a religion, however, it\u2019s a way of life; one which guides the personal, political actions of believers. Islam even has its own legal code.<br><br>This thread\u2019s topic is the new &#039;terms&#039; paste. Is it solid?

Converts to Islam are accused of being traitors to European culture, internal enemies that need to be watched, and potential terrorists. Having become new Muslims in a context where Islam is seen as everything that is not European, ethnic German converts disassociate themselves from Muslim migrants, and promote a supposedly denationalised and de-traditionalised Islam that is not tainted by migrant Muslims and their national traditions, but instead goes beyond them.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Some German Muslims along with some other European-born ethnic Muslims promote the idea that once cleansed of these oppressive accretions, the pure Islam that is revealed fits in perfectly well with German values and lifestyles. Some even argue that practicing Islam in Germany builds on the older but now-lost values of the German Enlightenment, including curiosity about and tolerance of difference. For East German Muslims who converted after the fall of the Berlin Wall, becoming Muslim was a way of escaping their East German identity.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Born Muslims who grew up in Germany increasingly adopt these discourses and promote de-culturalisation of Islam as a way for Muslims to integrate into German society without giving up their religious beliefs. At the same time, a newer and even more popular trend of Islamic conversion bypasses the questions of national tradition and identity altogether by ostensibly going back to the earliest roots of Islam, with converts isolating themselves not only from non-Muslim society but also from other Muslims.<\/span><br><br>http:\/\/blogs.lse.ac.uk\/europpblog\/2<wbr>015\/03\/30\/being-german-becoming-mus<wbr>lim-how-german-converts-to-islam-ba<wbr>lance-their-national-identity-and-t<wbr>heir-faith\/","time":1490764196,"resto":118738910,"id":"ZQP9ZQcG","country":"IN","country_name":"India"},{"no":118750786,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)01:13:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"You&#039;re possessed by a backwards idea that romanticizes a goat fucking pedophile.

They are white by some definitions. Ya know, the word &quot;hispanic&quot; refers to Spain and the Spanish language.<br><br>Most of the problems here, as always, come from European infighting and Europeans&#039; inability to work together and respect each other--the same shit that&#039;s produced the two hugest wars ever. It&#039;s funny and sad; I despise niggers, but they&#039;ve never tried to destroy the world. They probably never will. <br><br>So, the Mexico-US conflict--NOT a new world issue. Firstly, &quot;Mexican&quot; is a group term. Most illegal Mexicans are the short, homely native Indian folks who are generally scorned by the Spanish-descended ruling class of Mexico, who is happy to dump them on us, get it? Basically: this is one group of Euro-descended people shitting on another (the Germanic\/Anglo\/Nordic ruling class whites of the USA) using their unwanted native population to do it.<br><br>White Mexicans hardly ever move here-why should they? Mexico suits them fine. Whereas the lower-class native mestizos, oppressed and brutally poor, try to come here every chance they get; they have nothing to lose.<br><br>The second problem here is everyone confuses &quot;white&quot; and &quot;European&quot;. Some Europeans aren&#039;t literally white because they come from southern climes where the hot sun guarantees that they will have more melanin in their skin no matter where their genes originated. Spanish, Italian, etc.<br><br>In terms of skin color, the only real &quot;whites&quot; are Nordics, Anglos and some northwestern Europeans like Dutch, German, and &quot;white&quot; Russians\/Slavs. But all this skin color stuff is a distraction from the real problem: Europeans are the most powerful, type A populations in the world, and they can&#039;t ever get along. They never stop trying to burn everything down. Even with Islam threatening to destroy them all, they still can&#039;t cooperate long enough to fend off the mudslimes.<br><br>So smart, yet so stupid.

Of course they know niggers are scum. But so are you and that&#039;s why they have you fighting other scum, so you&#039;re too distracted to tear down the walls of science based on MUH FEELS.","filename":"1436300937584","ext":".png","w":1111,"h":1482,"tn_w":187,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491272043539,"time":1491272043,"md5":"ffWlwPbdFrlIdf4GS2adTA==","fsize":4116331,"resto":0,"id":"KMQ\/\/1qE","country":"AU","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-biggest-redpill","country_name":"Australia","replies":25,"images":7,"omitted_posts":20,"omitted_images":7},{"no":119419151,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)22:37:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119418851\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119418851<\/a><br>Get out.

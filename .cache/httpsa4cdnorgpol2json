Nobody looks up to someone who only knows how to take and consume. You need to have a skill or a niche that can provide for others. Theres a certain level of selflessness that must be part of your personality. If you cannot create or provide for others you are not a man.<br><br>Second is having a fighting spirit. When problems present themselves, men don&#039;t panic and break down, they find a solution. If a documented solution doesn&#039;t exist you create one. Solving problems is a big part of being a man.<br><br>Third, men don&#039;t show more emotion than necessary. Its acceptable to cry at a funeral, or when your loyal dog dies. It is not acceptable to cry when you lose a bet or a game. There are very few women worth crying over, but there are ones that exist. Don&#039;t let those mgtow faggots tell you otherwise. <br><br>Fourth, you have to love yourself before you can love another. Work out, contribute to a (productive, no ponyfaggotry or other permavirgin hobbies) group of some kind. Above all you need to find the source of your self esteem and nurture it. High self esteem will naturally lead to the motivation necessary to be a provider. Healthy body leads to healthy mind so start there.","time":1492690167,"resto":121981954,"id":"UsSAv2R+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121988286,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)08:09:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121987736\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121987736<\/a><br>Absolutely.

Leftypol used it to their advantage. About 50%+ were genuine, about 25% were Shills and the rest were just messing around trolling the gullible Redditors who eat up everything and don&#039;t have a clue how obvious they are when they comment. I&#039;ve even had suspicions that the raid was potentially orchestrated by the_cuckold or at least a few of them. They&#039;ve been getting called out in every thread. How convenient it is for them that a raid occurs at the same time they&#039;re being dealt with and called out. And how convenient it was for them that the shills were regurgitating what genuine posters were saying about telling Reddit to leave. And how convenient it was for them that they somehow managed to find the Discord Leftypol was supposedly using as a &quot;Base&quot; if you will.

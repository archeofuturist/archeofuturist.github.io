Yeah, I&#039;m talking to you. What the fuck are you doing? Sitting around here jerking off to cartoon girls, taking breaks to walk to your parents kitchen and make a snack to shovel down your throat.

Perhaps it&#039;s time to go for a trip, to the God Emperors Freedom Camp for Big Boys.<\/span><br><br><br>Our Commander and Chief, Donald Trump has demanded that the United States bolster it&#039;s ranks of the world&#039;s most powerful military with strong young men who are ready to help Make America Great Again, and equipting them with the world&#039;s best technology and weaponry to completely annihilate our enemies. The filthy chinks across the globe are building up for a showdown and we have to be there to send those slope-eyed sons of bitches packing! Meanwhile, the annihilation of ISIS is in full swing, with Americas elite on the ground rooting out every Islamic Jihadist that can take a bullet... Or a Drone strike!<br><br>Men just like you at this very moment are slaughtering America&#039;s enemies and building a brighter tomorrow for our families. Why not you? Someone&#039;s gotta kill our enemies and with the new flexibility the Pentagon has, THERE IS GONNA BE A LOT OF KILLIN! <br><br>If you plan on joining, what branch do you wish to join?

Judaism, Christianity and Islam all involve worship of the same God, an alien god.<br><br>Christianity, with it&#039;s endless preaching of &quot;turning the other cheek&quot; and &quot;loving one&#039;s neighbour&quot; (where neighbour is defined as EVERYONE) smell suspiciously of the suicidal altruism of social justice.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Luke 6:29<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;If someone strikes you on one cheek, turn to him the other also. And if someone takes your cloak, do not withhold your tunic as well.<\/span><br><br><br>Before you flood this thread with muh crusade memes, be aware that Christianity had to be painfully twisted in able to be accepted by those who already lived in Western Europe. Christ was militarised in order to appeal to Anglo-Saxons and probably Scandinavians (I know most about the conversion of England unfortunately).<br><br>To me (no expert, just a searcher after knowledge), it looks like the modern, fluffy Christianity is actually closest to the words Jesus spoke.<br><br>Which leads me to the conclusion that if we have to cure ourselves of our &quot;help the world&quot; agenda and renew western civilisation, we have to abandon this weak cuck religion and return to worshiping our own gods, with our own moral lessons. (I also think that returning to a pagan reconstructed religion would help promote traditional gender roles and improve fertility).<br><br>Let me know what you think \/pol\/.

Well here it comes.<br>It is, in fact, not SJW driven, atleast not at its core. It all begun in 2007 where EA did a study of why the untapped populous of females flocked to mirrors edge, but not to other titles with comparatively strong female protagonists.<br>Huge questionares where sent out, and the only stat that differed for mirrors edge was that, indeed, females rated her appearance as way uglier than the other ones, and that they could relate more to her than the others.<br>After this the study was performed again and again on new games and it was found that there was a direct correlation with facial structure to engagement of females. This study quickly leaked to all other big names in gaming including the company i work for.<br>So, simply put:<br><br>Females cannot and will not feel empathy or engagement for women that they see as competition.<br><br>That&#039;s why games like mirrors edge, assassins-creed(with ugly sidecharacters) and Horizon Zero Dawn are HUGE with females.<br>Its 100% market driven, and if you actually play these games you will also find that these characters RARELY are degenerate sluts, which would be the case if this was SJW driven. In most of these games the females openly reject brown males while in some cases hinting at attraction at the normal white guy (because guess what the vast majority of females loathe anyone that isn&#039;t white, just look at dating studies).<br>It is however also a success with SJW&#039;s because they think its more of a &quot;realistic&quot; female being represented. <br><br>So, don&#039;t worry guys, we will keep on putting hot chicks as antagonists and protagonists in games aimed for guys.<br><br>If anyone has any other questions about the inside of modern gaming feel free to ask.","filename":"A[1]","ext":".jpg","w":1920,"h":1080,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1492771843401,"time":1492771843,"md5":"gsbk4gtSag0ySHsEL0+V+A==","fsize":664485,"resto":0,"id":"RKf04JPt","country":"SE","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"you-know-the-trend-of-ugly-female-protagonists","country_name":"Sweden","replies":252,"images":35,"omitted_posts":247,"omitted_images":35,"tail_size":50},{"no":122140202,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)10:21:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122135960\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122135960<\/a><br>Alright Stepan why don&#039;t you link us up","time":1492784491,"resto":122123154,"id":"islsnIeq","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122140210,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)10:21:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"Bullshit.

Sacred 432Hz vs jewed 440Hz","com":"The real music conspiracy story begins in 1910 when a man named John Calhoun Deagan, an alleged member of the US Naval Intelligence which was funded by the Rothschilds through their agents in the Rockefeller family, joined the American Federation of Musicians and convinced the group to endorse a standard of 440 Hz tuning for all orchestras and concert performing musicians. He was successful but this standard only applied to public performances in America.<br><br>There are tons of comparisons on YT.

Don&#039;t be cruel and NEVER use the &quot;cause I said so&quot;. Always have the actual reason you say no. As they grow up give them as much responsibility as they are willing to take on and allow them more and more freedom. If you treat them like mini adults they will act like it. When they fuck up take those freedoms away and slowly return them. Never give in on punishments (early ungrounding, etc.) and always stick to your word. If you say you will do something, do it. If you say you will punish them for something, do it. Remember that you are the example. Intelligence is genetic but personality can be influenced by environment.

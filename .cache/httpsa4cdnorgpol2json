They &quot;offer&quot; all the tools users need to connect with a supportive community of individuals determined to quit porn use and free themselves from compulsive sexual behaviors. This has been known to cause nerosis, and obsession with self esteem. It distracts men from overcoming obsessive self worth by focusing on their sexual &quot;addictions&quot; so they can heal from porn-induced sexual dysfunctions, improve their relationships, and ultimately live their most fulfilling lives, and MGTOW fills the gaps. The process of recovering from porn addiction as \u201crebooting.\u201d The &#039;research&#039; has shown that heavy porn use can change the neural pathways of the brain causing addiction, hormonal changes, and sexual dysfunction. MGTOW &amp; nofap is sold as a personal process with no single correct approach. Thus effectively clouding young men. They challenge men to abstain from pornography, masturbation, or even sex altogether for a period of time. Rebooting the brain by abstaining from these behaviors has freed many users from porn addiction and porn-induced sexual dysfunction, but also tailored them to be addicts of another kind. MGTOW encourages men to leave behind family life all together, effectively castrating men, while also shaming them into not masturbating. This is prime mental insemination of a higher caliber, an ace in the deck played towards the creation of subservience in men.","filename":"pryramidz","ext":".jpg","w":1000,"h":667,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1493163134273,"time":1493163134,"md5":"VJfTrDSEn1je8f7y\/rdkig==","fsize":147130,"resto":0,"id":"HqSJR8m7","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"knowlege-bomb-nofapchild-free-mgtow","country_name":"United States","replies":28,"images":7,"omitted_posts":23,"omitted_images":5},{"no":122809965,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)19:58:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122806802\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122806802<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;106 results found.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;not a single scandal has come to light<\/span><br>t.shill","filename":"1476576132960","ext":".jpg","w":693,"h":693,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493164684242,"time":1493164684,"md5":"68mEZmnoPTIphAoo+ZzjwA==","fsize":57690,"resto":122806738,"id":"OHPnUuUa","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122810028,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)19:58:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122808560\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122808560<\/a><br><br>What do you know about this, OP?","time":1493164713,"resto":122806738,"id":"GDOhthRM","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":122810029,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)19:58:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122806738\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122806738<\/a><br>Where&#039;d your tripcode go?","filename":"1491689871844","ext":".gif","w":374,"h":520,"tn_w":89,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493164713592,"time":1493164713,"md5":"LP1WQIhqJK4CHz855KSKsg==","fsize":11916,"resto":122806738,"id":"h66GMoaB","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122810084,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)19:59:00","name":"Anonymous5","com":"<a href=\"#p122809965\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122809965<\/a><br>Shareblue shilling tactics reaching new lows.","time":1493164740,"resto":122806738,"id":"HqSJR8m7","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122810169,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)19:59:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122810029\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122810029<\/a><br>what I was thinking something up with anon5","time":1493164776,"resto":122806738,"id":"SGTdSK\/Q","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"}]},{"posts":[{"no":122795164,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)18:04:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"I know she is a Swedish SJW, but did she deserve to die that way \/pol\/?","filename":"3064975625_6d2ca16ac6_b","ext":".jpg","w":681,"h":1024,"tn_w":166,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493157878745,"time":1493157878,"md5":"6szR1Kjrvh6fF\/40vanmYw==","fsize":338264,"resto":0,"id":"zglykPDj","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"i-know-she-is-a-swedish-sjw-but-did-she-deserve","country_name":"United States","replies":69,"images":15,"omitted_posts":64,"omitted_images":15},{"no":122809460,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)19:53:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt; be around blacks<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; relax<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; get scalped and beheaded<\/span><br><br>You don&#039;t get what you deserve in life, only what you negotiate for.

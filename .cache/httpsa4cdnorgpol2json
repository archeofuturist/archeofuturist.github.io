I would say so. You could definately make the case for some relating better to the master qualities, as you did.<br><br>But, and this is my opinion, it&#039;s just as I stated before, masters can be allowed to flourish rather than made. You can beat a master into a slave but you can never make a slave into a master, ya get me? <br><br>Also, its worth noting, that masters are more concerned with life, with living, with growing, rather than with dying and heaven. So masters, being affirmed in life, don&#039;t feel the pull of religion in the same way a slave does.

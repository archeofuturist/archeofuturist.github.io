Your degree rarely becomes your life&#039;s work. Be prepared to do whatever you have to, in life to succeed. Also, don&#039;t blame the system, if you can&#039;t do enough remedial math to figure out that 80K is too much to spend on a degree when you are making 7.50 an hour at Burger King. A degree is not a guarantee of employment.

I&#039;m trying to create a list of personal virtues, or principles, that I think men should strive for, and it got me thinking; is it possible for men to have a basic, universal list of virtues they can agree on?<br>I&#039;m searching for things I might have gotten wrong or missed, criticisms or additions.<br>Writing is amateur because I&#039;m not good at it<br><br>--<br>\u1f08\u03c1\u03b5\u03c4\u03ae:<br><br>Truth<br>In all forms, in all avenues, in all facets. Speak it, <br>embody it, leave a lasting impression of honesty. <br>Unapologetic and unwavering.<br><br>-Strength<br>Of character, of mind, of body, of soul, of emotion. A <br>rock against the waves, an anchor against the storm.<br><br>-Autonomy<br>Free of influence, of slavery, of submission, of <br>obedience to anything but your own moral compass <br>and to God above, who placed it within you.<br><br>-Courage<br>Not to be fearless, but to shrewdly and unflinchingly <br>face demons and obstacles. To <br>stand tall in the face of the unknown with head high <br>and eyes open.<br><br>-Loyalty<br>To yourself, to your moral instincts, to your family, to <br>your friends, to those who deserve it, and to the <br>principles you strive to embody.<br><br>-Nobility<br>To represent all these values as a man, an <br>independent entity, inviolate and unwavering. With no <br>compromise or excuses; to inspire emulation and <br>admiration in all frames that intersect with your own.<br><br>-Respect<br>For life, for the mysterious Beauty, for your fellow <br>man, for the cosmos, for reality and all it&#039;s wondrous <br>truth. For your own consciousness and eternal soul, <br>whatever it may be.<br><br>-Curiousity<br>Never satisfied, never idle, never bored or content - to <br>learn forever, to question forever, to be skeptical and <br>thoughtful and eager. An eternal student to be a better teacher.","filename":"1488804250890","ext":".jpg","w":2048,"h":1367,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1493323438275,"time":1493323438,"md5":"kg\/ZiePcI10\/ggXfgReb8Q==","fsize":679688,"resto":0,"id":"y5WrZXVG","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"hey-pol-so-im-trying-to-create-a-list-of-personal","country_name":"United States","replies":3,"images":1},{"no":123080395,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)16:10:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/dO9BFGHTrC8","time":1493323833,"resto":123079590,"id":"aKE3SuhC","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123080760,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)16:13:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123079590\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123079590<\/a><br>i think not","time":1493323997,"resto":123079590,"id":"ja87\/Vxt","country":"CL","country_name":"Chile"},{"no":123080906,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)16:14:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123079590\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123079590<\/a>","filename":"allpills","ext":".jpg","w":2800,"h":830,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":37,"tim":1493324077777,"time":1493324077,"md5":"M9\/2jDfOQ+x7xuQEUhjGxQ==","fsize":422184,"resto":123079590,"id":"QCQxUw7q","country":"GB","m_img":1,"country_name":"United Kingdom"}]}]}

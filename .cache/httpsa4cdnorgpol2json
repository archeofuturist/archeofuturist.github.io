This doesn&#039;t work in reality, it&#039;s a fiction of bad logic. As for the monarch &#039;wishing to keep power&#039;, all they would have to do is disarm the public, ban free speech, consolidate all the weapons and grant great luxuries to those who wield the weapons so that they protect you and you can do anything you please with the greater public.

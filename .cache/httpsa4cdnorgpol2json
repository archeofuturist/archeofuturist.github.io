This commercial epitomizes American life right now better than any piece of art I&#039;ve seen recently. Modernity is an empty vapid nothing. Your social movements are all just a product. Feminism is a pussy hat for $9.95, Marxism is a Che Guevara t-shirt for $20. Nationalism is a MAGA hat for $40. Left or right it&#039;s all just a hodgepodge bundle of pop culture references, consumer items and &quot;opinions&quot; given to you by an (((elite))) that ultimately don&#039;t give a flying fuck what ideology they need to use to justify their rule. Regardless of the window dressing, you are getting Oligarchy, you are getting Neoliberal economics. you are getting cultural, economic and spiritual erasure of everything that made up your national\/ethnic\/religious identities.. et. This commercial&#039;s &quot;trivialization&quot; of american social movements, while maybe unintentional, is a pretty brilliant illustration of the all encompassing paradigm of consumerist nihilism that we live in.

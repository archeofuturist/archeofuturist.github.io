Accepting someone doesn&#039;t mean accepting their ideas when they push for legislative power they don&#039;t deserve.","time":1490358444,"resto":118066316,"id":"PvOgG2FP","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":118075528,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)08:28:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"Canadians are fucking scum.","time":1490358483,"resto":118066316,"id":"qCfwADof","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":118075561,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)08:28:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118068143\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118068143<\/a><br><br>Fucking Colgate.","time":1490358511,"resto":118066316,"id":"zluPXnN8","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":118075630,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)08:29:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118075098\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118075098<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;if you submit they will stop<\/span><br><br>Oh Ahmed if a population agree that some people have systematic advantage on another people through law, your population isnt even agreeing with the thing they are suggesting.","time":1490358570,"resto":118066316,"id":"0S+eCZeu","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118073326,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)07:58:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;The people spamming commie and &quot;drumpf&quot; threads on \/pol\/ are mentally ill trannies<\/span><br><br>I&#039;m not even surprised","filename":"QP48lsK","ext":".jpg","w":1920,"h":1896,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":246,"tim":1490356729782,"time":1490356729,"md5":"LD5gBdGELrLEfGg+0iuXsw==","fsize":256217,"resto":0,"id":"4c0SIAOc","country":"CA","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-people-spamming-commie-and-drumpf-threads-on","country_name":"Canada","replies":32,"images":12,"omitted_posts":27,"omitted_images":11},{"no":118074741,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)08:17:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118074509\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118074509<\/a><br>kys","filename":"hi retard","ext":".jpg","w":598,"h":399,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1490357859105,"time":1490357859,"md5":"+pQL7kjKtOmBHkoXrorJjA==","fsize":24054,"resto":118073326,"id":"XJTmjcGj","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118074841,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)08:19:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118074158\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118074158<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I was exactly the same during those days.<\/span><br><a href=\"#p118073709\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118073709<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;blaim r\/thedonald<\/span><br>I didn&#039;t know that \/r\/thedonald is 4 years old.","time":1490357942,"resto":118073326,"id":"VxaoIMoP","country":"AT","country_name":"Austria"},{"no":118075281,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)08:24:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118074495\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118074495<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I&#039;m just a bit sick of being called a CTR shill or some left\/pol\/ reject just because I criticised some American child who read a synopsis of The Fountainhead.<\/span><br><br>You&#039;re seriously upset about that?<br><br>It&#039;s not even an insult.

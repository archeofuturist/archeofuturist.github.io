It\u2019s manufactured in a particular discourse as that which is universal\u2026 as that which is outside time.\u201d That is, it\u2019s a construction, but it pretends it isn\u2019t. As any French philosopher or child with a Lego set will tell you, anything that\u2019s been constructed can be deconstructed, as well. If heterosexuality didn\u2019t exist in the past, then it doesn\u2019t need to exist in the future.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The line between heterosexuality and homosexuality isn\u2019t just blurry, as some take Kinsey\u2019s research to imply \u2013 it\u2019s an invention, a myth, and an outdated one. Men and women will continue to have different-genital sex with each other until the human species is no more. But heterosexuality \u2013 as a social marker, as a way of life, as an identity \u2013 may well die out long before then.<\/span><br><br>http:\/\/www.bbc.com\/future\/story\/201<wbr>70315-the-invention-of-heterosexual<wbr>ity<br><br>Discuss.","filename":"ambrosino[1]","ext":".png","w":620,"h":305,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":122,"tim":1493549262507,"time":1493549262,"md5":"kqvRCsgTqSSxe6PBwk2TDw==","fsize":283030,"resto":0,"id":"08AHAG3S","country":"HR","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"heterosexuality-argues-katz-is-invented-within","country_name":"Croatia","replies":13,"images":1,"omitted_posts":8,"omitted_images":0},{"no":123467275,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)07:07:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123465910\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123465910<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Men and women will continue to have different-genital sex with each other until the human species is no more<\/span><br>wtf does this mean? their sexual organs fall off? lolex","time":1493550441,"resto":123465910,"id":"BuyLjSXU","country":"RO","country_name":"Romania"},{"no":123467403,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)07:09:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123465910\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123465910<\/a><br><br>Ain&#039;t this a cliche, typical leftist postmodernist drivel.

According to Lam, all three vaccines combined amounted to more than $1.4 billion in sales profits for Merck in 2014. The controversialHPV vaccine, Gardasil also brought in $1.7 billion in profits for Merck. \u201cWhile a spokesperson for Merck told The Atlantic that vaccines remained one of its key areas of focus\u2014it generated $5.3 billion in sales in 2014\u2014she did not comment on the profit margins\u201d Lam wrote. Of course the Merck spokesperson would not comment on the profitability of vaccines because Merck would expose itself to more controversy. Analysts say that the profit margin is\u201cbetween 10 to over 40 percent.\u201d Lam also says that \u201cwhile the vaccine industry is likely more profitable now than in the 1970s or 1980s, this is the result of global market forces\u201d. Lam forgot to mention that billionaire couple Bill and Melina Gates pledged at least $10 billion for worldwide vaccination programs supposedly to combat polio and the measles, this is where Merck &amp; Co profit. It is also well known that Bill Gates appointed the former president and CEO of Merck, Raymond Gilmartin to the board of directors of Microsoft which lasted for more than 11 years before he announced his retirement in 2012.<br><br>its why the pharma industry fights honest people in the medical community using false dichotomies<br><br>vaccines = good. franken vaccines = bad. notice not one pharma shill on here has refuted what i have said. they never acknowledge i am pro vaccine and anti additional dangerous ingredients. this is their method. they will just call you anti vax and talk shit about how heavy metal x isnt a danger.","time":1493825105,"resto":123902902,"id":"fnOeFBBD","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123922930,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)11:25:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123922646\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123922646<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Now does it result in even worse addiction and neurological imbalances which might lead to more and worse depression in the future?

Are Slavs a race? <br> I have to point out that US, South Slavs are most probably of illyrian and Thracian decent, but some generic Slavic marks are found all over the place. I found Russians who have exact facial marks as some people form here. That is even more obvious on women than men. <br><br>For example I have most Dinaric (noric) skull and body that you can find. I am 190 cm tall, I have gray-blue eyes and dark brown hair with that blond shine that you can see in the sun, my beard though is mostly blond. Thos hair traits you can find all over the Europe. But I am fully aware of my &#039;&#039;Vlah&#039;&#039; or &#039;&#039;Krajisnik&#039;&#039; face (nose, skull, eyes position, cheeks) and I think I look a lot different than a Bosniak or a Croat from the same region of Bosnia.. (Even though Bosniaks are NOT a really ethnic group). Few months ago I ran on a Russian guy who looks like a brother of my. I assure you the dude looked exactly like me.

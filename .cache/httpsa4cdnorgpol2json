I grew up with a needy borderline batshit insane mother who pushed away my alcoholic zfg father. From an early age I was pushed to be her emotional tampon, pet and trophy. Which I weirdly never fell for. I read about guys going all beta because they become supplicating nice guys for their possesive mothers. <br><br>The problem is that I am now incredibly turned off by any girl that acts needy and emotional like my mom did. Which means every girl that likes me sends me running. So I end up with girls who are either not that into me, hung up on some guy or whatever. Because their distance gives me breathing room. Only to get stabbed in the heart later on when I try to get closer to said girl. Very fucked up dilemma. I&#039;m great with ons and flings though. <br><br>Abuse by women is one of the biggest underrated problems in our society.

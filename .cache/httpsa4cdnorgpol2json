I&#039;ve been interested in religion for a long time, even as a lifelong atheist. Satanism is a way to be spiritual without being religious, since most satanists are atheist. You can get into rituals and meditation and reach a feeling of enlightenment through your own self, rather than through the belief in a god.<br>2. I would say so. When you gain the ability to manipulate other peoples reality through covert techniques (kinda like day to day propaganda) you&#039;re invoking spirits, and when you gain the ability to raise your will to power and act on it with actual results that wouldn&#039;t have been obtainable without a belief from satanism, you&#039;re invoking a spirit. Also look up egregores\/group think. <br>3. I think that the archetype of Satan is actually the good guy. He is the liberator and the bringer of freedom, enlightenment and self reliance. He is the cosmic rebel and does only what is natural and human to him. <br>4. Honestly quite prevalent. I&#039;m not really sure if they practice an authentic version or if it is just meant for show\/entertainment but I doubt any of them actually meditate or are able to perform metamorphoses, two basic foundations of occultism. They seem like they like to sacrifice animals and people which is honestly more of a Christian practice gone awry. <br>5. Hmm. In the biblical sense he wants you to give in to your innate drives and desires. But again, this is merely metaphorical and is actually a good thing if you don&#039;t let yourself degenerate. It opens up portals to levels of consciousness that you can&#039;t get to with mainstream religions. I believe people like Carl Jung and Nikola Tesla were basically occultists because they dared venture where others hadn&#039;t. This is what Satan desires. <br>6. To free one from the wrath of Christianity or false guilt. <br>7. Ultimate freedom and knowing how to use that freedom to your advantage. It is egotistical but the ego shouldn&#039;t be viewed in a pejorative sense.","time":1491456359,"resto":119698667,"id":"kFwTWOSY","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119709987,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)01:27:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119709109\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119709109<\/a><br>I hit rock bottom and was struggling with my love for life and my self hatred.

I was unsatisfied by the fact that it is nothing like the religion of my ancestors and so I would dig through whatever sources I could find on the old ways and kept finding things that seemed to predict Christ.

I am surrounded by libs on all sides here so my talk of politics is always about how screwed up &quot;our&quot; party is. So many examples. Ginsberg not retiring is my favorite thing to get em thinking. Just ridiculous the way they just follow the narrative even if it&#039;s ping pong podesta. What a fucking weirdo. I really hope the White House isn&#039;t in chaos as much as it is starting to seem. They better get to the bottom of this shit in Syria too.

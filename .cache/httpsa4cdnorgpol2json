Nothing in the content of the Orkhon inscriptions suggest that Turks were not Mongoloid in appearance, which is why I posted pictures of Gokturk statues. The Orkhon inscriptions simply record a history of conflict and subjugation by the Chinese and a Gokturk ruler&#039;s dismay at his subjects assimilating into Chinese sedentary life rather than continuing their nomadic culture. Mongolian histories read similarly.<br><br>Do you deny that both the oldest examples of Turkic writing and the earliest recordings in Chinese history of the Turkic people refer to people in what is now within Western China and Mongolia? <br><br>Do you deny that the current people of modern Turkey are by and large the descendants of the indigenous Anatolians? Even South Asians have contributed more to the gene pool of modern Turkey than Central Asians have. Do you seriously believe that you resemble more the Turkic people of Central Asia and the original Turks of Western China and Mongolia than say the Greeks or the Levantines? Face it, the original Turks are more closely related to Mongols than they are to roaches. <br><br>Try this https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Genet<wbr>ic_studies_on_Turkish_people","filename":"turkicpeople","ext":".jpg","w":1792,"h":1267,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":88,"tim":1493239367606,"time":1493239367,"md5":"Kz2o1lSxrxDbZrZE1jjiEg==","fsize":358803,"resto":122902934,"id":"\/rlT9U6M","country":"CA","m_img":1,"country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122936112,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)16:42:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122935374\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122935374<\/a><br><a href=\"#p122935789\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122935789<\/a><br>Interesting.

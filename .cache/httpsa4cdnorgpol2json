His trial judge was having an affair with the prosecutor; the two would later get married. The same judge later expressed his regret at appointing a lawyer to Lee\u2019s state habeas proceeding who showed up to court obviously intoxicated. A state prosecutor raised concerns that the attorney was slurring his words, stumbling in the courtroom, and speaking incoherently, while \u201cintroducing the same items of evidence over and over again.\u201d Later, the judge told the lawyer that he was unaware he had only recently been in rehab. \u201cIf I had known that, I would not have put you on this case,\u201d he said.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Yet despite ample blood and fingerprints at the scene, virtually no physical evidence was found to match Lee. The case against him relied on eyewitness testimony \u2014 now known to be notoriously unreliable \u2014 along with two main pieces of forensic evidence. One was an apparent blood spot found on a pair of Converse sneakers Lee was wearing at the time of his arrest. According to the Arkansas Supreme Court, a state serologist \u201cconfirmed the presence of blood, but consumed the entire sample, thus removing the opportunity for independent analysis by the defense.\u201d The second piece of evidence was a hair sample thought to come from a black man \u201cand found to be \u2018consistent\u2019 with Lee\u2019s based on microscopic examination \u2014 a forensic method that has since been discredited,\u201d according to the Innocence Project.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The number of death row exonerees climbed to 158 this week<\/span><br><br><a href=\"#p122101887\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122101887<\/a><br><a href=\"#p122102125\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122102125<\/a><br><br>Not very bright, are you?","time":1492753899,"resto":122101543,"id":"3ZPCNo\/Z","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122103603,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)01:52:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122102072\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122102072<\/a>","filename":"1454905103775890","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":480,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1492753935163,"time":1492753935,"md5":"Gq2lcYf\/4mBvlFVkezAKaw==","fsize":48356,"resto":122101543,"id":"Zx2EK4uQ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122103847,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)01:55:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122102072\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122102072<\/a><br>2pbp","time":1492754104,"resto":122101543,"id":"QNuaPmW7","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122104280,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)01:59:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122103550\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122103550<\/a><br>Best case scenario is he did it and the right man was killed. <br><br>Worst case scenario is a dead nigger.<br><br>As you can see, there&#039;s no downside.","time":1492754375,"resto":122101543,"id":"WR50vdRU","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":122096472,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)00:36:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Have girlfriend<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Smart, master&#039;s degree<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;great personality<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Gets first big job <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;working 45 hours a week<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;stressed, now spends all of her weekends napping and sleeping<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;me<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;work 45-50 hours a week<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;stressful job also<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Keep up with current events<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;work out<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;manage my own stock portfolio<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;currently researching rental properties<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;spend weekends doing low stress activities<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;read\/research skills related to my profession<\/span><br><br>How long do you think women will last in the work force?

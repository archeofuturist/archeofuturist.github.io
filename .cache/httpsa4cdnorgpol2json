The question is: why would white working class, non-college educated persons be seeing these spikes in deaths from suicides, opiates, cirrhosis, etc while their POC counterparts continue to see declines in such deaths and overall mortality? And the only logical answer is that whiteness has provided, historically, even to working class non-college whites a certain faith in mobility (at least horizontal, within industries), and the idea that if they just worked hard, things would be OK. People of color never had the luxury of buying this, by and large, but most whites did. Of course now, as the economy shifts, and these working class whites find themselves struggling to adapt to change (economic, social and cultural) they are UNIQUELY ill-prepared to deal with it, having come face to face with the declining value of their historic color-currency (at least in absolute terms, while still existing relative to POC).<br>Whereas POC have always known the American myth of &quot;rugged individualism&quot; and mobility to be a half-truth at best, a lie at worst, white folks didn&#039;t...and so these death spikes should really be seen as the COST of white privilege...the privilege of obliviousness to how the world works; the privilege of believing the dominant narrative, which served you well for a long time, and is now...toxic. That is the irony of privilege: it&#039;s a set up, and most whites would be better off relinquishing it and joining with POC to forge a better way than continuing to cling to the false ideology of traditional Americanism, which has let them down precisely because it is unsustainable in a modern, ever-shifting global economy and society...<br><br>check your privilege before you kill yourself","filename":"images","ext":".jpg","w":268,"h":188,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":175,"tim":1490621372208,"time":1490621372,"md5":"pKizl+znXwodUfN+CXW2Nw==","fsize":8133,"resto":0,"id":"AToMQqM\/","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"this-is-why-white-americans-are-suicidal-drug","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":118503375,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)07:30:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"Why did ideological pan-celticism not arise in western Europe like pan-germanism and the neo-roman movement did in the 20th century? <br><br>The &#039;western&#039; sphere was unique in its hostility to consciousness of supranational European races, despite forming an alliance in WWII to oppose the Germanic and Romance spheres of power which essentially conforms to the Celtic cluster of the ethnocultural map.<br><br>What gives?","filename":"tmp_11981-Cesare_prima_Gallia_58_a.C._jpg-255788626","ext":".jpg","w":1704,"h":1181,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":173,"tim":1490614205889,"time":1490614205,"md5":"ZsAkQvXEQn2w\/SjcLjrkaQ==","fsize":404044,"resto":0,"id":"oshR3m1s","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"why-did-ideological-pancelticism-not-arise-in","country_name":"United States","replies":21,"images":3,"omitted_posts":16,"omitted_images":2},{"no":118511351,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)09:16:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"Probably because Celtic peoples weren&#039;t culturally Celtic on the whole and the two countries with Celtic ethnic roots were historic rivals","time":1490620571,"resto":118503375,"id":"hn1dE14c","country":"NZ","country_name":"New Zealand"},{"no":118511753,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)09:21:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118504449\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118504449<\/a><br>England is definitely too perfidious.","time":1490620869,"resto":118503375,"id":"ooatYISU","country":"KR","country_name":"South Korea"},{"no":118512076,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)09:25:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118506500\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118506500<\/a><br><a href=\"#p118508462\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118508462<\/a><br><a href=\"#p118508624\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118508624<\/a><br><a href=\"#p118508751\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118508751<\/a><br><a href=\"#p118508807\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118508807<\/a><br><a href=\"#p118509024\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118509024<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;try to start a thread about the west European ethnic identity <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;zero replies<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;question why Thrace is doing on my medieval map <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;raise the anthropology corps of Vlad the impailers army back from the dead <\/span><br><br>Lmao that&#039;s probably a more profound commentary on western Europe&#039;s abnormal sense of ancestry than any of their replies to this thread. <br><br>I know next to nothing about the inheritance of Baltic civilization but it seems like you are within the culturally self-aware domain of Europe.

Look at planned parenthood for example. It benefits far less than half the population, so why should the whole population pay for it? Furthermore, if it does benefit you, or you do want it&#039;s services to continue, you are free to organize a fund to keep it alive. Sucking money from people who don&#039;t want to pay for things to benefit you is not a right.<br>Tldr; People believe money will fall from the sky, (millionaires and billionaires), to pay for things when in reality they will pay out the ass for it because our government can&#039;t do anything efficiently.","time":1492879481,"resto":122294369,"id":"rTyrWoBk","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":122296802,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)12:44:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Germans unironically believe red part belong to them<\/span>","filename":"alsace-moselle","ext":".png","w":261,"h":289,"tn_w":225,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492879479363,"time":1492879479,"md5":"CUXJSsr5Rdp0zAB549Gu2w==","fsize":34010,"resto":0,"id":"8GLK2CA1","country":"FR","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"germans-unironically-believe-red-part-belong-to","country_name":"France","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":122283348,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)10:41:34","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Make France great again.","com":"Tomorrow, France makes its choice...","filename":"2827r","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":960,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1492872094934,"time":1492872094,"md5":"oaE9OdnqGOWZZciv1jSHFw==","fsize":252431,"resto":0,"id":"bNwaYzVM","country":"FR","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"make-france-great-again","country_name":"France","replies":89,"images":31,"omitted_posts":84,"omitted_images":30},{"no":122296526,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)12:42:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"le pen will win the first round, but will lose the second round to fillon.","filename":"IMG_0552","ext":".jpg","w":1114,"h":1600,"tn_w":87,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492879338237,"time":1492879338,"md5":"ze+LhKOlnVnrpg3YIjqoSQ==","fsize":475784,"resto":122283348,"id":"pXHMR1bl","country":"DE","m_img":1,"country_name":"Germany"},{"no":122296591,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)12:42:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122285142\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122285142<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;not on the lords day <\/span><br><br>Bait?","filename":"IMG_5550","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":480,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1492879376185,"time":1492879376,"md5":"TcQjDRQlRPiN2BjqqODU\/g==","fsize":80367,"resto":122283348,"id":"biH7fqyq","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122296676,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)12:43:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"Also, a couple highlights from the whole election season thus far.

I agree with my Moroccan dude here. Young people are increasingly hating islam here and I&#039;m one of them. <br>But in the case of Belgium or any other muslim community that is trying to exist in a non muslim country, they are practicing and praying more because it&#039;s what they have to do in order to exist. If they would stop those things, their children would do too and their community would become more secular and adaptive.This is a good thing of course but they think about this as a form of identity loss.

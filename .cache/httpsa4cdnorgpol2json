Whoever you are and however long you&#039;ve been on here know this. The same thing happened to bush. He had the advantage of blind nationalistic support back then because there wasn&#039;t much of an internet know how of kike trickery. Look how that ended up. Look at what it did to the right for the last decade. Look at the god damn twitter response to it. Those alt light alt right dorks are all in agreement. Everyone here anon or rebbitor please do not blindly support Trump. If he lets the neocons do as they wish and bends to their will he can pound sand for all I care, I will work with whoever and whatever to tarnish him and burn him to the ground. Trump is a hair away from betraying all of us, don&#039;t end up like the neocons. Don&#039;t repeat their mistakes. We need to use every ounce of meme magic and word of mouth internet power to tell him not to go through with it. He prides himself on knowing we&#039;re with him and that his voter base likes what he&#039;s doing. If he cucks out on Syria we have to fight with every fiber in our being to end him and burn him to the ground. I know a lot of first time voter Trump supporters are probably going to leave retarded replies like sad!, Fake news!, or shill or blah blah so be it. Everyone else, complain, post, tweet, make calls, for christ sake do something. If Trump fucks with Assad and gets involved with Syria we are fucked six ways to sunday.","filename":"Molymeme and the final argument","ext":".png","w":551,"h":627,"tn_w":219,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491510803311,"time":1491510803,"md5":"4cFQPr5UK7Zppgb9gl1fmQ==","fsize":473495,"resto":0,"id":"ZwgiA2YN","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"dont-fall-for-their-tricks","country_name":"United States","replies":14,"images":3,"omitted_posts":9,"omitted_images":1},{"no":119795023,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)17:07:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"Sage","time":1491512846,"resto":119790372,"id":"W5uiOo5D","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119795035,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)17:07:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119790372\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119790372<\/a><br>Bump","time":1491512851,"resto":119790372,"id":"7xwyFTi5","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":119795172,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)17:08:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119790372\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119790372<\/a><br>THIS","time":1491512908,"resto":119790372,"id":"l0MoFRat","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":119795393,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)17:10:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119792925\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119792925<\/a><br>Wrong, look at Stefan&#039;s Twitter right now.","time":1491513003,"resto":119790372,"id":"ZyX+5Ngn","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119796019,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)17:14:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"If Trump thinks Antifa is bad wait til he sees 62 million pissed off Trump voters....I&#039;m sick right now","time":1491513277,"resto":119790372,"id":"ybQRJnwE","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":119766889,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)13:31:34","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Irish census results are out today","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;the census found there were 810,000 foreign-born people in the Republic<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;the number of people who stated they could speak Irish dropped for the first time since 1946<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;there are 5,929 daily Irish speakers in the county, a 15.8% drop since 2011<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;some 3,729,100 people identified as Catholic - 78.3% of the population - compared to 84.2% in April 2011<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;there were 63,400 Muslims in the state compared to 49,200 in 2011 - a percentage change of 28.9%<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Orthodox Christianity saw a rise of 37.5% to 62,400 adherents, while the number of Hindus rose by 34.1% to 14,300 practitioners<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;the number of people who stated they had no religion increased from 269,800 to 468,400<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;http:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/world-euro<wbr>pe-39516154<\/span><br><br>Feels like there&#039;s a lot more than 63,400 Muslims in Dublin desu.","filename":"3009112","ext":".jpg","w":952,"h":629,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":165,"tim":1491499894865,"time":1491499894,"md5":"nHVW9YIbbky3BZXbp3QucQ==","fsize":154724,"resto":0,"id":"PNDPOLQ6","country":"IE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"irish-census-results-are-out-today","country_name":"Ireland","replies":275,"images":52,"omitted_posts":270,"omitted_images":52,"tail_size":50},{"no":119795522,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)17:10:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119795084\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119795084<\/a><br>I make over a hundred grand a year with certs that take 6 months to get if you&#039;re not a mouth breathing retard.

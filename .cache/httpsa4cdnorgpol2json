I must say just reading the book is not enough to understand it, it requires additional background readings. Simplified example: Brave New World was inspired by communists, quiet obvious from names like LeninA. In early soviet union there existed practices of sexual promiscuity. One commie feminist said that sex is just a physical need like thirst. They encouraged women to have sex with proles requesting it. It resulted in spread of STD&#039;s and rapes. Eventually Stalin stopped the practice and purged commie jews like Trotsky who supported promiscuity, USSR drifted from BNW into 1984. Now we have leftists pushing polyamory(everyone belongs to everyone) and love(cummies-feelies).

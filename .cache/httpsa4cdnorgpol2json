When it&#039;s good it moves people, and when it&#039;s REALLY good it has a sort of faceless quality where the personality of the artist concedes to the song itself. This is a quality of good music. What Led Zeppelin, The Beatles, Skrillex, Diplo and The Rolling Stones all have in common is that their music disappears when all the people who were around for it die. The songs just make less sense when they aren&#039;t framed by douchey antics.<br><br>You can hate jazz for being nigger music or whatever all you want, but &quot;classical&quot; or &quot;art&quot; music hasn&#039;t produced a master orchestrator to the level of George Russell, Gil Evans or Maria Schneider or even Thad Jones probably since Stravinsky (who was vehemently against Bolshevism and supported the Royal Family). Maybe the aesthetic needs a facelift but the importance of group communication, dynamics, counterpoint and spontaneity is something Western Music desperately needs to rediscover. And we&#039;re not gonna get there starting another shitty pop punk band.","time":1492697590,"resto":121989495,"id":"lG0+N8g7","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121998338,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)10:14:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121998169\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121998169<\/a><br>Islam will Insha&#039;allah take over the world soon and behead infidels who dare offend our prophet like you. die american scum","time":1492697662,"resto":121989495,"id":"eLUQmiyh","country":"EG","country_name":"Egypt"}]}]}

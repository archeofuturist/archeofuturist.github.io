Washington is gearing up to launch an offensive on the Islamic State&#039;s stronghold in Raqqa, a mission that could get sidetracked if Russian aircraft fly over the area. U.S. aircraft would have to take steps to avoid them, whether by changing course or aborting the mission. At worst, the Russians could also drop bombs near U.S. targets, forcing Washington to respond by shooting down Russian aircraft -- triggering a much larger flare-up between the two powers. Moscow could try to escalate conflicts elsewhere as well, including in eastern Ukraine, to try to improve its bargaining position with Washington. But this tactic may also run the risk of further souring the prospects of negotiation.<\/span><br><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Of course, the Trump administration&#039;s quick and decisive action in Syria was also designed to send a message to observers beyond the Middle East. As the threat of North Korean nuclearization grows, the move was meant to give Beijing and Pyongyang pause.

Nevertheless, the current geopolitical climate is hardly conducive to a bargain between the two. In fact, at least in the short term, U.S. President Donald Trump&#039;s administration has an incentive to adopt a harder stance toward Russia in hopes of deflecting the political pressure stemming from an ongoing probe into the Trump team&#039;s ties to Moscow.<\/span>","time":1491695847,"resto":120203654,"id":"XlcvSYw8","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120204518,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)19:58:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120204256\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120204256<\/a><br>Show me one, a single one, regime change you fuckers did right.","filename":"1491573321509","ext":".gif","w":200,"h":293,"tn_w":85,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491695918758,"time":1491695918,"md5":"ktsBgNU3CCTIo9lKMZyHfQ==","fsize":1833972,"resto":120203654,"id":"e\/b6jeij","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":120204523,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)19:58:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120204256\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120204256<\/a><br>Sorry, didn&#039;t mean to reply to you","time":1491695920,"resto":120203654,"id":"XlcvSYw8","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120204658,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)19:59:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120204369\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120204369<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Your Chancellor came out in support of us fuccboi<\/span>","filename":"merkel klatschen","ext":".jpg","w":630,"h":472,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1491695991917,"time":1491695991,"md5":"zmiRTblV02X8JRqDUrL3sw==","fsize":36778,"resto":120203654,"id":"e\/b6jeij","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":120204666,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)19:59:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120204518\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120204518<\/a><br>Shitty north korean terrorists are less threatening than less violent north korea with nukes","time":1491695994,"resto":120203654,"id":"itMnNLvT","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":120204144,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)19:55:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"Holy Jesus I&#039;m the most autistic man in the world \/b<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In honors English class Friday before break<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Its a discussion based course so at the beginning of each class we&#039;re given some retarded prompt that we have to talk to the class about<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Today&#039;s prompt is &quot;What does a normal day look like to you?&quot;<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;All the normalfags say things like &quot;I go to work&quot; or &quot;I do homework&quot; and &quot;I hangout with my friends&quot; <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Then its my turn <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;activatelevel900autisum<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;I go to school, then come home and browse reddit all day&quot;<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Thirty seconds of silence<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The normies are all visibly abhorrent<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Ass is literary a Geyser of musty sweat at this point<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Some girl who sits next to me says &quot;He watches porn&quot; <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Entire class erupts into laughter <\/span><br> <br> It was a nice life \/b, but I&#039;ll probably commit suicide Sunday before school starts again","filename":"Autisum","ext":".jpg","w":780,"h":438,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1491695739756,"time":1491695739,"md5":"GOajPrA67QOOqbKt+FSm4A==","fsize":75047,"resto":0,"id":"rCmVLflI","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"holy-jesus-im-the-most-autistic-man-in-the-world","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":1},{"no":120204662,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)19:59:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"Kek.

The test isn&#039;t trying to quantify explicit neural connections or brain regions or neurotransmitters. It is a way of lumping people who think and behave similarly into similar categories. The fact that the test gets reliable, repeatable results alone demonstrates that you asserting its bullshitness means you have misinterpreted why people talk about it. You can argue whether or not it can be used to increase function, but if you notice, the kind of people who like discussing MBTI happen to be the types of people that like to analyse and dissect things? Because the test exposes and breaks down structures and modes of thinking. It is not 100% &#039;accurate&#039; because there is no claimed objective fixed variable that these numbers are measuring against, it is an internal measure, a percentage of questions asked. When there are enough questions, you can arrive at an answer that will be relatively repeatable. Very few people who test as ESTP will ever randomly test as an IFNJ unless they have brain trauma or suffer from disassociative identities.<br><br>You literally admit that its useful as a way to highlight similarities, yet still seem to want to cling the idea that it is somehow &quot;wrong&quot;?

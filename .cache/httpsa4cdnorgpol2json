If you two met attending Bible study, continue attending Bible study. If you met playing softball, keep playing softball! The best way to strengthen your relationship is to ensure that you do not become stagnant, and unattractive. If you allow yourself to develop poor physical fitness, or poor mental fitness, this will set off alarm bells in your wife which will encourage her to seek the attention of other men. <br><br>Other things which you may do to KEEP your girl is to ensure that she does not spend time around loose women, or bitter women who will encourage her to be resentful and contentious. If you are able, spend time with a happily married older couple, and seek out their advice. Be careful however, as some of these marriages may be merely marriages of convenience, with any spark of attraction long since died out.","filename":"James Dean11","ext":".jpg","w":736,"h":1051,"tn_w":87,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492599575522,"time":1492599575,"md5":"yA5e2ZhZ0tzTGSzzTOxzFg==","fsize":125563,"resto":121823854,"id":"sJFa4M+R","country":"CA","m_img":1,"country_name":"Canada"}]},{"posts":[{"no":121830021,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)06:37:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;America the richest country on the planet<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Can&#039;t afford to build a wall<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;China managed it 500 years ago<\/span><br><br>lol","filename":"greatwall of china","ext":".jpg","w":800,"h":600,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1492598225806,"time":1492598225,"md5":"7JzIEqFsLHoE+9XqJ\/s20g==","fsize":144655,"resto":0,"id":"\/9jQCovt","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"america-the-richest-country-on-the-planet","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":21,"images":7,"omitted_posts":16,"omitted_images":5},{"no":121831395,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)06:58:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121831178\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121831178<\/a><br>The wall as we know it was built in the 1400s, there was a lesser wall built before that.","filename":"1483783132400s","ext":".jpg","w":124,"h":71,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":71,"tim":1492599497497,"time":1492599497,"md5":"LEG2YaqSHu3O+DULHqxBZw==","fsize":1907,"resto":121830021,"id":"\/9jQCovt","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121831416,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)06:58:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121831016\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121831016<\/a><br>Everyone was north east of where you thought.

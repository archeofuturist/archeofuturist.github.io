Their victims, who they arrest, beat and torture, are at their mercy. They are protected by many things: by the tinpot tyrants who rule a republic violently subjugated by Vladimir Putin; by the den of reactionary views that is the Moscow regime; and by the acquiescence \u2013 support even \u2013 of a society soaked in homophobic hatred.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Their consciences will not trouble them. It is always comforting to imagine that those who commit atrocities against fellow human beings are sociopaths or evil. But that does not explain the great horrors of human history, from fascism to colonialism. Inhumanity is only made possible by stripping a group of its humanity. You only feel empathy, after all, for those you feel are human beings like you. That\u2019s how human beings who in other contexts feel compassion and love and warmth can become capable of the most unspeakable horrors.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Yes, Chechnya is a profoundly conservative society whose bigotries are legitimised by reactionary Islamism. But however extreme its current manifestation in this Russian republic, homophobia everywhere springs from the same place. It is, above all else, about policing what it is to be a man. Being gay is regarded as the most sinful corruption of manliness. The Chechen persecutors may not flinch as they break bones, because they see them as a mortal threat to their own sense of masculinity. That\u2019s why homophobia is so inextricably bound with the subjugation of women. In Chechnya \u2013 and all over the world \u2013 the struggle for LGBT rights will only be achieved with the liberation of women.<\/span><br><br>http:\/\/archive.is\/aMxxF","filename":"IMG_1793","ext":".jpg","w":750,"h":920,"tn_w":203,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492211349702,"time":1492211349,"md5":"2duRuA5xYzZuSJ6+\/lH7wQ==","fsize":146656,"resto":0,"id":"i4lm0nc6","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"he-persecutors-of-chechnyas-gay-citizens-now-feel","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":1},{"no":121129742,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)19:10:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"Nice slide.","time":1492211441,"resto":121129547,"id":"3chwXTBo","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":121131987,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)19:29:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121129742\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121129742<\/a>","filename":"photo-slides[1]","ext":".jpg","w":1000,"h":686,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":85,"tim":1492212578791,"time":1492212578,"md5":"pKN4fTzLX+I\/qjEUdr37sg==","fsize":86071,"resto":121129547,"id":"le4sMg6E","country":"NZ","country_name":"New Zealand"}]},{"posts":[{"no":121120536,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)17:57:27","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Why are our elders disrespected?","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;I just took my grandparents out for Pho<\/span><br><br>What does this image and this caption say about the current generation of elderly people, their psyche, and the people who should be respecting them?<br><br>Is this a problem in society?","filename":"file","ext":".png","w":1023,"h":767,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1492207047813,"time":1492207047,"md5":"hdUo3k0Mk5PiGRM9XyxOVQ==","fsize":1318412,"resto":0,"id":"oPQILv8I","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"why-are-our-elders-disrespected","country_name":"United States","replies":75,"images":8,"omitted_posts":70,"omitted_images":8},{"no":121131925,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)19:29:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;be me<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;be boomer uncle&#039;s birthday<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;uncle calls me to hang out with him and his drunk boomer friends<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;they all lecture me about how easy I have it and how i&#039;m a snowflake and my life is easy and all I ever care about is buying the latest iphone<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;meanwhile I am an engineer constantly fighting Pajeets they let in to cut corners and due to high realestate rates they set I have to rent which is still about $1400 a month thanks to them and the only phone I could afford is a $40 shot generic Android phone<\/span><br><br>The problem with them is they don&#039;t listen and think they understand everything.

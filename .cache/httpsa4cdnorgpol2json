I went to college for roughly two years, learned a trade, and you would think with my education on top of my experience working in the field I would get better offers, but almost all of them so far have been low ball minimum wage offers with little to no growing room in the company, basically dead end jobs. <br> <br>This one job offer however was my final straw and I don&#039;t know whether to keep looking or what.

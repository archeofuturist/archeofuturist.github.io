I made fun of him pretty bad. And I made fun of him in front of people. Believe it or not, I felt bad about it for a long time. I&#039;m usually not one to make blatant fun of people, but I just blurted it out. I couldn&#039;t contain myself. It just happened. It wasn&#039;t until the furry shit started to become more widespread that I realized that I should never have felt bad. That he deserved to be made fun of. That he deserved to be ridiculed. That this was the natural order of things. And unless there are people who are willing to stand up and make fun and put people in their place and tell them the thing they&#039;re saying is fucking retarded, it will inevitably lead to things like furries.

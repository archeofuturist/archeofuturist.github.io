Now, blood harvested from babies\u2019 umbilical cords has been found to have even stronger anti-ageing effects.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Joseph Castellano at Stanford University in California and his colleagues discovered this by collecting blood from people at three different life stages \u2013 babies, young people around the age of 22, and older people around the age of 66 \u2013 and injecting the plasma component into mice that were the equivalent of around 50 years old in human years.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The most dramatic effects occurred when these mice received babies\u2019 cord plasma. They became faster learners and were better at remembering their way through a maze.

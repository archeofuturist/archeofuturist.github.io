Lines have been drawn in the sand by both sides involved that will inevitably intersect and lead to open conflict. <br><br>The Cause:<br>The United States of America was founded on traditions, ideals and principles of Freedom. All nations are in their own way great, but America is the greatest not because of it&#039;s military conquests or later economic power, but because its foundation gave the ordinary person something he had never had in the history of mankind: actual freedom and equality under the law.<br><br>Recognizing this there will always be a small, hardcore group of American citizens that value their Rights and Freedoms, and can point to countless irrefutable documented facts of powerful forces attempting to subvert those very Freedoms to pursue their own agenda.<br><br>At some point the tyranny will become too much, a series of Waco-like events perpetrated by the outlaw government will set the country into war. The enemy knows this, which is why there hasn&#039;t been anything like Waco since.<br><br>The Sides:<br>In all likelihood it will be Patriot Militias fighting a guerilla warfare strategy against tyrannical government forces possibly even with NATO help. There is rumored to be a proper command system in place for the Patriot side called the Second Continental Army of the Republic or S.C.A.R. This military organization is said to be staffed by competent ex high ranking US military members. The only way to join S.C.A.R. is by invitation only, after exhaustive intelligence gathering on said unit. The best and most serious militia units are those not known to the media or authorities. <br><br>The Outcome:<br>If the Patriots win the civil war, which will be very long and costly, then humanity has a chance at restoring the Constitution of the United States and all the principles it stands for. This means over 90% of all laws would be repealed. There will be no welfare of any kind. There will be no subsidies for industries of any kind.","filename":"3904823084","ext":".jpg","w":550,"h":367,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1491254767498,"time":1491254767,"md5":"eChtzPEMLuc3MoOp6QnNCw==","fsize":57150,"resto":0,"id":"c3bqYasc","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"2nd-us-civil-war-is-inevitable","country_name":"Canada","replies":43,"images":10,"omitted_posts":38,"omitted_images":10},{"no":119388624,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)18:12:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119385577\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119385577<\/a><br><a href=\"#p119385026\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119385026<\/a><br>Name me any society in history that was not affected by greedy individuals.<br><br>Capitalism uses the natural greed of individuals to help other individuals.

In fact, to apply under the Federal Skilled Workers program, you need to have either a Canadian degree or get your foreign degree assessed for it&#039;s equivalence and credibility by the CIC. While there are Indian cardiologists driving cabs, that has more to do with the highly limited number of residency spots available for foreign medical graduates.

For the past couple of decades you&#039;ve had an unprecedented deluge of migrants from Latin America, legal and illegal. Thankfully, because of our geography, we don&#039;t have the same problems. I think many leafs on \/pol\/ mistakenly assume that Canada has similar immigration issues to Europe or America because they see a lot of chinks when they go downtown. The difference is that we&#039;re highly selective and we can be, whereas Europe is getting hordes of young men. Hordes of young men from any country is going to be bad news because young men are the most violent and crime-prone demographic by far, let alone young men from low-trust societies.<br><br>Because we have a pretty boy who says nice things on Twitter as our leader, people assume we have a generous immigration policy, when we don&#039;t. We&#039;ve never taken in more immigrants per year than there have been Canadians born in the same year. Most of the Mexican migrants who tried to come here after their visa requirements were removed have found that they&#039;ve spent thousands of their own dollars to be rejected and deported. If the Canadian immigration system were marketed by a conservative in another country, it would likely be met with uproar from liberals, and praise from conservatives. Instead, we have a liberal populace that thinks we&#039;re international heroes with our immigration policy, and a bunch of misinformed leafs who think that we&#039;re Sweden.","time":1491257332,"resto":119380965,"id":"JJ0nwLYp","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119388863,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)18:14:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119387850\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119387850<\/a><br>I&#039;d rather not, and I think it would be silly if I was forced to leave.

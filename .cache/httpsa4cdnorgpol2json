Some of these fragments struck Earth, causing a global cataclysm unseen since the extinction of the dinosaurs. At least eight of the fragments hit the North American ice cap, while further fragments hit the Northern European ice cap. The impacts, from comet fragments a mile wide approaching at more than 60,000 miles an hour, generated huge amounts of heat which instantly liquidised millions of square kilometres of ice, destabilising Earth&#039;s crust and causing the global flood that is remembered in myths all around the world.<br><br>A second series of impacts, equally devastasting, causing further cataclysmic flooding, occurred about 11,600 years ago, the exact date that Plato gives for the destruction and submergence of Atlantis. The evidence for all of this shows beyond reasonable doubt that a civilisation at least as technologically advanced as 19th-century England at the onset of the Industrial Revolution (if not more technologically advanced) that flourished during the last Ice Age was destroyed in the global cataclysms between about 12,800 years ago and about 11,600 years ago.<br><br>A distant memory and a warning to the future - for the comet that wrought such destruction in remote antiquity may not be done with us yet.","filename":"iceagemap","ext":".png","w":853,"h":440,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":128,"tim":1493127842998,"time":1493127842,"md5":"cs0+u5uti9vK6vqtSQSaoQ==","fsize":557051,"resto":0,"id":"MT5xsBCS","country":"AU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-red-parts-of-this-map-used-to-be-land-daily","country_name":"Australia","replies":292,"images":51,"omitted_posts":287,"omitted_images":49,"tail_size":50},{"no":122764472,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)14:12:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122736001\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122736001<\/a><br>We&#039;ve found their tech","time":1493143970,"resto":122734952,"id":"pPl9yQDE","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122764506,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)14:13:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122764200\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122764200<\/a><br>Its the truth.","time":1493143983,"resto":122734952,"id":"ia25bJqi","country":"HU","country_name":"Hungary"},{"no":122764527,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)14:13:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122763646\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122763646<\/a><br>Winged snake is likely myths going back to the end of the antediluvian civilization as the end of the era would have been signaled by a winged snake in the sky, the comet passing near earth whose trailing pieces reset earth.<br><br>Its actually presumed that the remenants of this world ending meteor are still a meteor shower we pass through twice a year.

The government allows the niggers rights and defends those with force, not because it&#039;s just some &quot;thing&quot; that cannot be broken. If &quot;human rights&quot; was the force prohibiting oppression, there would be no murders or rapes or... oppression.<br><br>In reality, we can look at our closest ancestors in the animal kingdom and see that the only thing that matters is who has the power, who has the hierarchy in their favour. To keep it that way, no man, woman, child, or faggot is spared. The leopard does not spare the disabled prey because &quot;prey&#039;s rights&quot; is stopping him. If there was an entity to act on behalf of the prey, then yes, it can secure rights for the prey if the entity is more powerful than the leopard. If not, the leopard reigns supreme. <br>You observe this with Brevik: human rights didn&#039;t stop him from killing the fifth column, superior force did acting ON BEHALF of those rights.","time":1490847187,"resto":118829282,"id":"A\/UlBdaT","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118881231,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)00:16:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118880921\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118880921<\/a><br>The difference between your animal analogy and the social hierarchy is that humans are a collective.

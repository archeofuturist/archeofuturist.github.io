Whites outnumber minorities by far and have higher turnout which means that their support means much more than you&#039;d think.<br><br>Secondly, the more time whites spend in general vicinity to blacks, the more racist they become, in the south it&#039;s at this point a tradition. As such the non-white demographics are double-edged sword for democrats, because while demographically flooding with them sounds nice, as they will generally vote Dem, but before they start outnumbering whites turnout-wise, they are counter-effective. Hence why Ohio or Iowa were obviously going to vote Rep in 2016 - Obama administration flooded them with non-whites.","time":1493455451,"resto":123311466,"id":"LQtaoPx3","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"}]},{"posts":[{"no":123308483,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)03:11:01","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Political Test","com":"if you&#039;re left of me you need to leave 4chan<br><br>let&#039;s have a thread and bully newfags<br><br>https:\/\/8values.github.io\/","filename":"gtkrwn","ext":".png","w":800,"h":600,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1493449861130,"time":1493449861,"md5":"yo40JSLlvD755ncpXT6IIg==","fsize":86615,"resto":0,"id":"vaZ13Bf4","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"political-test","country_name":"United States","replies":44,"images":22,"omitted_posts":39,"omitted_images":21},{"no":123313935,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)04:41:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123313874\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123313874<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;implying he&#039;s worse than THIS<\/span><br> <a href=\"#p123313849\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123313849<\/a>","time":1493455296,"resto":123308483,"id":"RcFQgr6S","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123313950,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)04:41:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123313849\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123313849<\/a><br>A","time":1493455306,"resto":123308483,"id":"vye+9SSk","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123314006,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)04:42:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123313950\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123313950<\/a><br>FUCKING","time":1493455368,"resto":123308483,"id":"RcFQgr6S","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123314032,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)04:42:40","name":"God","com":"<a href=\"#p123308483\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123308483<\/a>","filename":"download (2)","ext":".png","w":800,"h":600,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1493455360206,"time":1493455360,"md5":"n6ErLO3G0q8cYfxW96x19w==","fsize":105419,"resto":123308483,"id":"ugs3Zqz2","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":123314073,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)04:44:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123311798\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123311798<\/a><br>No?

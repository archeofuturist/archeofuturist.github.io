A similar situation happened with Grand Theft Auto San Andreas - Except in SA it was just files that weren&#039;t even usable. In MEA it&#039;s full on sex. Back in 2007 the first Mass Effect got in trouble with Fox with its sex scenes, and they were far more tame compared to this video. I suggest a two front attack; We contact Fox and tip them off about MEA having porn in it, and lodge complaints with the ESRB about MEA being wrongly classified as a Mature game and should be Adults Only.<br>Here are the relevant links: <br>https:\/\/www.esrb.org\/about\/contact.<wbr>aspx<br><br>You can email or tweet at Fox: <br>foxnewstips@foxnews.com<br>@foxnews","filename":"4534545","ext":".png","w":960,"h":540,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1490073281817,"time":1490073281,"md5":"cBf3EE+zKz9WRBD3DtkwUw==","fsize":477698,"resto":0,"id":"Vzm4P9aI","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"normally-i-would-go-to-v-with-this-but-with-your","country_name":"United States","replies":177,"images":41,"omitted_posts":172,"omitted_images":41,"tail_size":50},{"no":117619435,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)08:23:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117618982\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117618982<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;starting a precedent for having gays be listed is ESRB<\/span><br>thats a spicy meme anon","time":1490098999,"resto":117591047,"id":"6rKxRfQF","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":117619489,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)08:24:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117619435\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117619435<\/a><br>**listed in","time":1490099040,"resto":117591047,"id":"6rKxRfQF","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":117619546,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)08:24:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117617992\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117617992<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;knowing full well that it was complete garbage and would be endlessly ridiculed online.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;but she&#039;s one of those kinds of fangirls who knows that she likes garbage but will continue to ingest it anyways, just to see how garbage it is (she&#039;s also a dev btw)<\/span><br><br>the developers were just banking on the fact that they would sell more copies to the SJW sheep instead of the \/v\/ sheep. or maybe the guy making the decisions thinks that by greenlighting this he&#039;s doing his part in some non-existent morality war just like the sjw that will buy it knowing it&#039;s an objective pile of shit<br><a href=\"#p117618657\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117618657<\/a><br>i remember reading some threads on \/v\/ about people quitting\/being fired over the way they were running things. could easily be a roleplay fag though","time":1490099075,"resto":117591047,"id":"QxZObyhi","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117619707,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)08:26:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117619305\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117619305<\/a><br>Bioware uglifies its women intentionally to make irl women less insecure","time":1490099203,"resto":117591047,"id":"iUYpeAvb","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117619923,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)08:29:37","name":"cytube eggkara","com":"<a href=\"#p117617118\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117617118<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Can you just imagine the beta orbiters surrounding her saying wow you&#039;re so good at this! <\/span><br>Do you really think that bimbo does any of the hands-on work herself?

Japan\u2019s crime and drug-use rates are famously low. Life expectancy is famously high. Japanese students put their American peers to shame on international tests. The unemployment rate clocks in at 3.1%. All this is supposed to be a function of a homogenous society with a high degree of cultural cohesion\u2014the antithesis of cacophonous, multiethnic America.<br><br>Japan\u2019s population shrank by nearly a million between 2010 and 2015, the first absolute decline since census-taking began in the 1920s. On current trend the population will fall to 97 million by the middle of the century. Barely 10% of Japanese will be children. The rest of the population will divide almost evenly between working-age adults and the elderly.<br><br>But whatever their other benefits, \u201cpro-family\u201d policies won\u2019t reverse the demographic trend. Only large-scale immigration can do that, and the Japanese won\u2019t countenance it. The flip side of cohesion is exclusion. The consequence of exclusion is decline.<br><br>Without immigration, our demographic destiny would become Japanese. But our culture wouldn\u2019t, leaving us with the worst of both worlds: economic stagnation without social stability. Multiethnic America would tear itself to pieces fighting over redistribution rights to the shrinking national pie.<br><br>Every virtue has its defect and vice versa. The Japanese are in the process of discovering that the social values that once helped launch their development\u2014loyalty, self-sacrifice, harmony\u2014now inhibit it. Americans may need reminding that the culture of openness about which conservatives so often complain is our abiding strength. Openness to different ideas, foreign goods and new people.

And if you can&#039;t achieve these things in your real life, then you are not ready to be a political activist, either online or in real life. Because if you can&#039;t make anything of your own, individual life, then how can you think you&#039;ll be able to make a real difference for the race, for the lives of many?<br><br>Always remember: we live in first world countries and have opportunity that most people born on this planet don&#039;t. Take care of yourself. Work your ass off, every day, to build a good life for you, and for your family. Spend your time wisely, and keep your real life priorities in order. Nothing on the internet should ever take away from your real life. Your time on Earth is short and precious.

I was talking with a really-good-looking-for-an-asian chick from our class, her mother probably thought she was too good for her vietnamese village and moved to west kind of good looking. Anyway i was really conversing some deep shit with her, and when i turned around i saw a big group of finnish girl from my class all looking angrily at me. Like they had all turned their heads at me and looked at me with the same expression that finnish guy looks at a white woman who is with an arab guy. Funny shit.<br><br><br>Made me think that because asian women can actually be kinda attractive, immigration from asian countries isn&#039;t being promoted by women. White women know that with arabs and blacks, the females are more ugly than men, and there isn&#039;t even a slight chance a white guy might be interested in arab or balck girl over white women, while arab and black men can still be attractive enough so a white woman might considerer them over a white guy. So that&#039;s why white women promote immigration from middle east and africa, but from asia. Because they know there is no chance african or middle eastern girls will be more attractive than them, while the guys might still be attractive. Which is the exact opposite with asians. White women just want to improve their position, while they are really against the white man improving his position.","time":1492164585,"resto":121036795,"id":"PKir1bYK","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":121044483,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)06:16:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121044018\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121044018<\/a><br>You&#039;re absolutely correct, my Mongol friend.","time":1492164968,"resto":121036795,"id":"hqOR2yJQ","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121045686,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)06:33:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121041999\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121041999<\/a><br>Holy shit this is catchy","time":1492165999,"resto":121036795,"id":"0ehdsls5","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":121046390,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)06:43:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121043391\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121043391<\/a><br>50% of pol came out as Kpop fans","time":1492166607,"resto":121036795,"id":"0ehdsls5","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":121047519,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)06:59:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;asian, through plastic surgery and makeup acquire white futures<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;white people find them attractive<\/span><br>Who could have guest?","time":1492167542,"resto":121036795,"id":"RhstU8E8","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"}]}]}

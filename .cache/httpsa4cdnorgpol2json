To many, this may be too long to read, as your attention span may have already lingered off in another direction. I&#039;ll try to keep these points precise and numbered, with a quick rundown on the topics at hand.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; 1) Each generation from baby boomers &amp; up is being bombarded with sexualization.<\/span><br>- From social media to magazines to TV to video games to erotic literature, etc., sex has been proven time &amp; time again to be the #1 interest in matured or maturing human beings. <br>- Every day, we are exposed to some form of sexuality. Whether it be browsing the internet &amp; coming across suggesting pictures or even nude pictures, or even going outside and seeing how slutty women dress.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; 2) With the decline of religion (mostly Christianity) in the west, sex has become easier to normalize in society.<\/span><br>- Social media apps such as tinder &amp; even apps like instagram\/snapchat\/etc. promote narcissism in women and the steadily available option to have easy casual sex. <br>- Because society is bombarded with sexual content every day, these social media platforms allow society to give into their degenerate desires.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; 3) Contraceptives allow for this moral degeneracy to occur without requiring any social responsibility to procreate<\/span><br>- The contraceptive (condoms, birth control pills, plan B) industry thrives off of over sexualization and social media to exist. Without these 2 factors, contraceptives would not be as profitable.<br>- Contraceptives promote the idea of casual sex by ensuring that the risk of having a baby is significantly lowered, as well as the risk of receiving STIs from sexual encounters.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; 4) Sexual Intercourse is losing\/has lost it&#039;s meaning of procreation between 2 consenting human beings who truly love each other<\/span><br>- The more that porn &amp; casual sex is normalized, the less emotional sexual intercourse becomes","filename":"eJwNwtsNwyAMAMBdGACbN842iCCSKqkRuF9Rd29P96jPvNSmDpGxNoD9XJXnrpfwLL3pztyvVsa5dOUbikipx93essAmcsGnkDEYsv8IlpB8NBkpuBgpegvGZ2fIJcKcnH6Nrr4_v_wihw","ext":".jpg","w":410,"h":614,"tn_w":166,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491230710399,"time":1491230710,"md5":"lyGvqjF05e26eUtJEMcWJQ==","fsize":52329,"resto":0,"id":"HVdBStZv","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"sexual-degeneracy","country_name":"United States","replies":194,"images":21,"omitted_posts":189,"omitted_images":20,"tail_size":50},{"no":119346277,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)12:28:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119335477\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119335477<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;which leads to interracial sex with men who tend to have larger penis size (Africans)<\/span>","filename":"1485197233062","ext":".png","w":830,"h":987,"tn_w":105,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491236900041,"time":1491236900,"md5":"29UOyfg1yvPBOhCKDji7Rg==","fsize":738072,"resto":119335415,"id":"6UFOuwsp","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119346302,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)12:28:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119335415\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119335415<\/a><br>And yet the newer generations so called sexual deviants and degenerates actually have LESS sex and LESS interaction with the opposite sex than previous generations","time":1491236911,"resto":119335415,"id":"RjDO5Khp","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119346324,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)12:28:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"NoFap for about 3 months now. Feel much more happy through every day. I&#039;ve gained much more confidence just because I&#039;m not thinking about sex every 6 seconds or if I see a girl with a good body. <br><br>More energy, lost 20kg and started to train at the gym. Started playing electric guitar (almost like masturbating to me at that point). I can actually give my 100% on things now and I can focuse on something I&#039;ve really interested in. <br><br>The next step for me is to find a lot of friends and maybe even a nice girl for the future. <br><br>Fuck pornography and everyone who thinks is is liberal to support the sexualisation of our society. If you hever had such problem than good for you, but you must realise that our society has changed a lot just like our values have changed. Stop being ingorant and realise that sexualisation is not good for children and our society.

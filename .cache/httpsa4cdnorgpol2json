Outside of Europe, they are very popular in some South American countries, notably in Argentina and Uruguay. Electronic bidet-integrated toilets, along with functions like toilet seat warmers, are commonly found in Japan.<br>In northern Europe, bidets are rare, although in Finland bidet showers are common.[7] Bidet showers are also common in South-East Asia, South Asia and parts of the Middle East.<br>In 1980, the first &quot;paperless toilet&quot; was launched in Japan by manufacturer Toto,[8] a combination of toilet and bidet which also dries the user after washing. These combination toilet-bidets (washlet) with seat warmers, or attachable bidets are particularly popular in Japan and South Korea, found in approximately 60% of households.[citation needed] They are commonly found in hotels and even some public facilities. These bidet-toilets, along with toilet seat and bidet units (to convert an existing toilet) are sold in many countries, including the United States.<br><br>MUCH LIKE INDIANS CANNOT POO IN LOO, AMERICANS SMEAR SHIT AROUND THEIR ASS WITH TOILET PAPER LIKE SUB HUMANS.<br><br>BIDETS ACTUALLY CLEAN THE ASSHOLE AND ARE VERY HYGIENIC.<br><br>I bought a bidet attachment for my toilet on amazon from the link below for $35 and it is life changing.<br><br>https:\/\/21stcentury-living.com\/2017<wbr>\/04\/02\/why-your-home-and-toilet-nee<wbr>ds-a-bidet\/","filename":"bidet today","ext":".jpg","w":800,"h":800,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491357750720,"time":1491357750,"md5":"uts9XgEdRnUn0WGBUrI0cg==","fsize":78817,"resto":0,"id":"ajtgVxXk","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"united-states-should-mandate-bidets-like-italy","country_name":"United States","replies":102,"images":25,"omitted_posts":97,"omitted_images":25,"tail_size":50},{"no":119578191,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)02:42:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119558284\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119558284<\/a><br>More like SHADILAY","filename":"gotem","ext":".png","w":600,"h":966,"tn_w":77,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491374556737,"time":1491374556,"md5":"j9TNz\/AHeipIyPPZLtMF+Q==","fsize":466450,"resto":119550965,"id":"sL8iRAhq","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119578243,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)02:43:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119578191\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119578191<\/a><br>more like CRINGE you faggot fuck","time":1491374594,"resto":119550965,"id":"jDrS45FT","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119578273,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)02:43:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119578243\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119578243<\/a><br>more like EDGE you faggot cuck.","time":1491374621,"resto":119550965,"id":"sL8iRAhq","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119578310,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)02:44:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119551393\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119551393<\/a>","filename":"1491178316024","ext":".jpg","w":1375,"h":749,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":68,"tim":1491374647347,"time":1491374647,"md5":"TTwr7eOcxE+v1guE\/waFig==","fsize":127820,"resto":119550965,"id":"VhYNwTsa","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":119578365,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)02:44:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119550965\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119550965<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Should Mandate<\/span><br><br>ok:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;complete horse shit<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;should make it a law<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;because bernie<\/span><br><br>i appreciate the kikes and everything but wew lad","time":1491374695,"resto":119550965,"id":"ccVmjdEL","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":119571057,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)01:18:02","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Find out who I am.","com":"I figured that if you could find a flag in the middle of BFE, you can probably find out who I am.

Even if trains could give me a more speed than a car, it won&#039;t be faster than a plane, and I&#039;ll just be surrounded by niggers on a cramped train opposed to cozy driving in my own car with its ability to stop when and where I want it to.","time":1491254930,"resto":119361034,"id":"EPhhnFap","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119383428,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)17:29:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119382809\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119382809<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Musk will be in prison for investor fraud in 10 years.<\/span><br><br>Highly unlikely... although his methods are questionable, it would be a publicity and investor nightmare to watch a big entrepreneur be burned up.

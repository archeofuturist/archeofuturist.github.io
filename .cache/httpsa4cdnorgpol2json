Such a military presence would have smothered the ISIS terror network in its cradle.<br>Instead, the vacuum created by America\u2019s withdrawal led rapidly to the emergence of ISIS as the largest terror organization in history, with tentacles in Iraq, Syria, Yemen, North Africa, and other countries around the world. It also led to the slaughter of hundreds of thousands of Christians, Yazidis, and other \u201cinfidels\u201d and chaos throughout the Fertile Crescent that created 20 million refugees across the region while Obama was in office.<br>Second, Obama\u2019s Middle Eastern retreat was crystallized by his failure to enforce the \u201cred line\u201d he had drawn in Syria to prevent its dictator from using chemical weapons. This capitulation allowed Russia to move into the region, replacing America as its dominant external power.<br>Third, at the same time, Obama directed harsh diplomatic moves against Israel\u2019s leader, Benjamin Netanyahu, and Egypt\u2019s Hosni Mubarak, another American ally. In the midst of public demonstrations against the Egyptian regime, he declared that Mubarak must step down, effectively driving Mubarak out of power while giving political support to the Muslim Brotherhood to replace him.This reprised Jimmy Carter\u2019s attack on the Shah of Iran, an American ally, which led directly to the creation of the first Islamic terrorist state.<br>The fall of Mubarak paved the way for the ascension of the previously outlawed Muslim Brotherhood, the organization that had nurtured bin Laden and provided the ideological foundations for the Islamic holy war. When the Egyptian military toppled the Brotherhood, the White House cut off military aid to the new regime, driving the largest Arab nation into the arms of the Russians.&quot;","filename":"fakedonald","ext":".jpg","w":1100,"h":619,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1492073049447,"time":1492073049,"md5":"AUSanG8Ny8bdSPVGbyhJKQ==","fsize":135081,"resto":0,"id":"GLEGlUQn","country":"NO","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"meet-your-new-warlord-neocon-donald-trump","country_name":"Norway","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":120870633,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)01:06:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Russia rounding up degenerates and sending them to &#039;concentration camps&#039;<\/span><br><br>Is this legit?

She predicted Donald Trump would become President and would use her Twitter account to relay what she claimed were messages from God that only enlightened human beings would be able to understand, one of them being that the past present and future are not sequences of events one after another but are actually all happening at the same time. Another was that there is an infinite number of universes in which every detail can be infinitely different. Also, she tried to kill herself in 2012 and claimed that she succeeded but that successfully killing yourself will only result in your consciousness being shifted into another universe in which you become another &quot;you&quot; who survived your own suicide attempt, but are still in the same life situation that you experienced before your attempt. Since then Tila claims to have developed a special relationship with God by which she can receive messages to share with the public. Interestingly, she does not claim to be God himself, but tells her fans to follow Jesus so as to dissuade a personality cult. She consistently criticizes (((Them))) in her videos and also claims that she has the power to alter our universe with her mind.

It is estimated that Hamas, Hezbollah, Islamic Jihad and Syria now have about a quarter of a million rockets and missiles between them. In the most extreme scenario, with Iran joining the melee, the number of missiles increases considerably.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The most ominous threat now facing Israel is the possibility of a surprise rocket and missile attack in which all of its enemies \u2014 Hezbollah, Hamas, Islamic Jihad, Syria and Iran \u2014 fire tens of thousands of rockets and missiles at Israel in a single day, in a coordinated attack. Israel compares such a scenario to the &quot;1973 Yom Kippur surprise,&quot; in which Egypt and Syria attacked Israel simultaneously. As of now, Israel has no response to such an attack.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The assessment is that, in such a scenario, the Israeli air force will successfully destroy thousands of long-range missiles and launchers, mainly those belonging to Hamas and Hezbollah. Similarly, Israel&#039;s missile defense systems will intercept many more missiles. Nevertheless, the Israeli Home Front will still suffer hits from thousands more rockets and missiles, the most accurate of which could reach Israeli air force bases, impeding the air force&#039;s capacity to respond. One senior Israeli military official told Al-Monitor on condition of anonymity that &quot;the only response to such a threat is deterrence. Our enemies know exactly what price they will pay for initiating such a move, and it will be much higher \u2014 incomparably higher \u2014 than the price paid by Israel.&quot;<\/span><br><br>http:\/\/www.al-monitor.com\/pulse\/ori<wbr>ginals\/2017\/04\/israel-syria-hezboll<wbr>ah-hamas-islamic-jihad-iran-missile<wbr>s.html","time":1492071651,"resto":120884471,"id":"Rl+mkmsk","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120887049,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)04:24:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120886650\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120886650<\/a><br>Same thing doesn&#039;t apply to your qt grills, apparently.

Whenever you hear anyone mention the word, make a point to let everyone hear you speak out against Antifa. Most people don&#039;t know anything about it and just support them because &quot;anything called anti-fascist must be good!&quot; and if people start to hear counter-points you can bet some them will change their minds or at least look into the facts. If you are ever granted the chance, don&#039;t hesitate to call them out face to face.

If you truly feel, as I do, that we are at a point where we can no longer be silent or risk losing everything you are obligated to take the risk though so do it proudly.

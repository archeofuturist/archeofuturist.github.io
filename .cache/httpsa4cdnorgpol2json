After that it could turn around and fly to Hyvink\u00e4\u00e4 airport for refilling its shit load and redo the maneuver. Within a few years the defense budget to achieve a situation where the flight rotation was it would be nearly constant and Estonians would not have any idea why their capital is given tens of thousands of pounds of horse shit every day.","filename":"b2spirit","ext":".jpg","w":734,"h":1016,"tn_w":90,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492871363379,"time":1492871363,"md5":"l10R0cwHtACg5M5stOa\/uA==","fsize":73973,"resto":122271243,"id":"btQGCX6N","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"}]},{"posts":[{"no":122277937,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)09:44:36","name":"Anonymous","sub":"&gt;The Falklands belong to Brit......","com":"Why do we still have this piece of irrelevant land we stole centuries ago?

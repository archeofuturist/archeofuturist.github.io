Try to get into a school that will teach you a marketable skill. For instance, go into the Navy and learn navigation. Doing something like this will shock you out of yourself and force you into situations where you will have to grow beyond the boundaries you have imposed on yourself. You will develop self esteem through accomplishment. Feeling good about life is a result of engaging in life, not hiding from it. You can do it, believe in yourself even if you think you are hopeless. <br><br>Gave this same advice to the poorest girl in our town thirty years ago, she joined the Air Force and went on to become an officer and have a wonderful career and travelled all over the world. Her mother and sister were prostitutes.

People like you can and have saved themselves, no one can do it but you. There is no help out there, but there is opportunity.

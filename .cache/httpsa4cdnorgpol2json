Fuck that.<br><br>Dating is to see if the other person is the right match - not to jump past all that and take on a role nobody involved knows is right for you.

For great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised: he also is to be feared above all gods. For all the gods of the people are idols: but the LORD made the heavens. Glory and honour are in his presence; strength and gladness are in his place. Give unto the LORD, ye kindreds of the people, give unto the LORD glory and strength. Give unto the LORD the glory due unto his name: bring an offering, and come before him: worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness. Fear before him, all the earth: the world also shall be stable, that it be not moved. Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice: and let men say among the nations, The LORD reigneth. Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof: let the fields rejoice, and all that is therein. Then shall the trees of the wood sing out at the presence of the LORD, because he cometh to judge the earth. O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good; for his mercy endureth for ever. And say ye, Save us, O God of our salvation, and gather us together, and deliver us from the heathen, that we may give thanks to thy holy name, and glory in thy praise. Blessed be the LORD God of Israel for ever and ever. And all the people said, Amen, and praised the LORD.<\/span>","time":1492568895,"resto":121766039,"id":"VTB639\/l","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121786565,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)22:29:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121784353\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121784353<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;They are in the churches, and they are not venerated because they are just art, not holy relics or anything like that.

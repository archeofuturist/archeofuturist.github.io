Why do you guys stand by Trump even though there have been so many links to collusion with Russia. Why do you dismiss this so easily when the future of our nation could be at stake? Sure, He could have no links and they could all be coincidences, but at the same time, Its better to be safe than sorry. Why do you so blindly follow a guy who is only trying to make the rich richer? <br>Oh yeah, it&#039;s because you&#039;re a bunch of NEETs who have no future and don&#039;t care about the outcome of our society because no-one would talk to you anyways.","filename":"1489894624684","ext":".png","w":612,"h":612,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490164444650,"time":1490164444,"md5":"JX8v2Dsgr2E4GRdCou8RQg==","fsize":643803,"resto":0,"id":"9BZ2MGpx","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"you-guys","country_name":"United States","replies":83,"images":11,"omitted_posts":78,"omitted_images":10},{"no":117742984,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)05:40:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117742539\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117742539<\/a><br>The public has essentially been fooled into believing that if a single russian retweeted a Trump tweet that it&#039;s &quot;Treason&quot; and grounds for impeachment which is exactly what the Dems want.

No country is quite like this, although I&#039;d argue that certain Western or Western-influenced countries are moving very much towards an extremely sexually open model, where average people have in excess of 30+ sexual partners in their lives, sexual and carnal acts are allowed and not viewed shamefully even in public, sensual acts such as slapping asses, twerking, etc. are allowed on public television, etc.<br><br>IMO there is some balance in the middle which accounts for and allows a healthy level of sexual expression while also enforcing norms good for society, such as strong families. Sex should be viewed as normal and healthy in many contexts, and unavoidable due to people wanting it on average so much.

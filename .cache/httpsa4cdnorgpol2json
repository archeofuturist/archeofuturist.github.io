The Protestant Reformation degraded the power of the Church, and a combination of Enlightenment radicals, populism from weak kings, and the rapid rise of powerful merchants degraded the Aristocracy.

A powerful noble class or parliament would only lead to oligarchy, which is what liberal democracy has become. The ruler rules, and the people follow. It is important to remember that in the ruler exists two personalities, the human, and the sovereign. The human may be skilled, but they are still human, prone to error and lack of judgement. The Sovereign&#039;s word is law, and their power absolute and unquestioned. To prevent tyranny, I would advocate the establishment of an advisory council with the power to remove the sovereign by questioning their ability to rule. If the sovereign is skilled, or the council rebellious, its decrees are ignored. If the sovereign is unskilled or rules as a tyrant, they are removed from office.","time":1492162250,"resto":121034058,"id":"rlhEeHdA","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"},{"no":121042227,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)05:44:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121041247\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121041247<\/a><br>I agree on the concept. However, I would suggest that the role of the council you propose is naturally fulfilled by the aristocracy. In other words, it is an informal council composed of whomever has the power and resources to have influence, rather than being a formalized system that can be gamed, or devolve into a blind bureaucracy. This also has the advantages of there being cultural\/traditional constraints upon those who could check the sovereign.<br><br>In the past, we can see that kings and nobles constantly fought each other and struggled over power. This is not inherently a problem. The problem is when their struggles drag the whole country and it&#039;s people into it. There cannot really be a single, monumental, constant political order. A system of regular competition is good. In modern democracy, this means the entire populace is constantly engaged in low level ideological warfare with each other, which is disastrous for social cohesion and a big waste of time. Let the fighting and competition be between a select few, who are also those who have the most skin in the game as they are likely to be large scale property and business owners, and everyone else can get on with regular life.<br><br>We can see the biggest example of this if we look at warfare in Europe before the industrial era. It was generally between nobles (of the same country or different ones) fighting with forces that were a relatively low percentage of the population. Things were generally decided quickly. Contrast this with the sorts of total warfare we saw after the French revolution, and we can see the difference in damage to the civilization. (Industrialization is certainly a contributing factor to total warfare, but not the only one.)","filename":"ChAzlUmUYAAYnUt.jpg large","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":566,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":69,"tim":1492163062115,"time":1492163062,"md5":"fiFrQ6tQyPskGXvZz7x4VQ==","fsize":136487,"resto":121034058,"id":"w5t6mS3o","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":121021858,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)01:07:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"Wish this man a happy birthday.

He immediately launched one of the most ambitious programmes for social and economic change ever attempted on the African continent. To symbolize this new autonomy and rebirth, he renamed the country from the French colonial Upper Volta to Burkina Faso (&quot;Land of Upright Man&quot;). His foreign policies were centered on anti-imperialism, with his government eschewing all foreign aid, pushing for odious debt reduction, nationalizing all land and mineral wealth, and averting the power and influence of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank. His domestic policies were focused on preventing famine with agrarian self-sufficiency and land reform, prioritizing education with a nationwide literacy campaign, and promoting public health by vaccinating 2.5 million children against meningitis, yellow fever, and measles.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Sankara was assasinated in 1987, his body was dismembered and he was quickly buried in an unmarked grave, while his widow Mariam and two children fled the nation. Blaise Compaor\u00e9, the coup perpetrator, immediately reversed the nationalizations, overturned nearly all of Sankara&#039;s policies, rejoined the International Monetary Fund and World Bank to bring in &quot;desperately needed&quot; funds to restore the \u201cshattered\u201d economy, and ultimately spurned most of Sankara&#039;s legacy.

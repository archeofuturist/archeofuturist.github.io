(&quot;For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but we have one who was tempted in every way that we are, yet was without sin. 16Let us then approach the throne of grace with confidence, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need.&quot; Hebrews 4:16 &quot;No man cometh to the father but by me&quot;, etc)<\/span><br>That&#039;s mistaken. We don&#039;t pray to the Holy Virgin Mary to act between us and God. What we do, as the Apostles did and early church did, is ask them to pray for on our behalf, just as you would ask your family to keep you in their prayers. This is what we mean when we pray for the intercession of the Virgin Mary or the Saints. Would you not ask a math whiz for their help on an exam? Same here, you&#039;re asking for the intercession of them on your behalf. You still pray to God, obviously. Your concern is a misunderstanding of early Protestantism because all they had to go off of was the warped and corrupted Roman Catholic institution.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;But even aside from that, the biggest glaring hole is the fact that you believe Mary was an eternal virgin when the bible itself speaks of Jesus&#039; siblings?<\/span><br><br>We don&#039;t believe that. The Virgin Mary was born human and is Holy as she could have dinner but did her very best to live by the Law, and did, hence God choosing her. Roman Catholicism came up with the heresy of &quot;Immaculate Conception&quot; far after they left the Church. <br>Second, Christ doesn&#039;t have siblings. This mistaken belief is brought from a lack of understanding of Greek, which the MR was first written in. In Greek, &quot;brothers&quot; was used for close friends, groups, etc, and not strictly &quot;blood-brothers&quot; as englush would have it. Again, the Early Church (Orthodox) never understood Scripture in that way. <br>Hope this helps.

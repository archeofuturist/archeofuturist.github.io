Flynn did not violate the Logan Act by attempting to influence US foreign policy.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;February 2, 2017 \u2013 The IC leaked what it said were details of conversations between President Trump, Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, and Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto. Both Australia and Mexico denied media reports that the calls were acrimonious and that Trump made threats, was rude, and behaved badly.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;February 8, 2017 \u2013 In an interview with the Washington Post, General Michael Flynn categorically denied having discussed sanctions with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. Thus we see that the Washington Post had been given classified information by the IC and wanted to get Flynn on record so that they could spring what they thought was a brilliant trap.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;February 9, 2017 \u2013 The New York Times and the Washington Post published articles claiming that General Michael Flynn discussed sanctions with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak in December of 2016. The articles were very confusing and contradictory.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Why couldn\u2019t the IC tell us if Flynn had broken the law or not? Because everyone had been given a different story. General Flynn also knew he was being recorded. Therefore we can have no doubt that this was a sting operation coordinated between President Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, General Flynn, the FBI, and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI).<\/span><br><br>We&#039;re currently witnessing the biggest shakeout in the history of the IC. <br><br>Also, why is the original website: http:\/\/www.thomaswictor.com offline and throwing a database error?

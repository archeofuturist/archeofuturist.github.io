We generally liked the guy as he said lulzy things and was more genuinely far right than any other politician. A subreddit called R\/The_Donald popped up. Sooner than later, a bunch of T_D people realized we were much quicker on the uptake than they were and generally had better analysis and news coverage\/discussion and didn&#039;t ban people for violating groupthink. They all migrated over here.

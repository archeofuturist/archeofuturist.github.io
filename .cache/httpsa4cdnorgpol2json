As he grew up his life became increasingly anguished and eventually everyone turned against him. He was protected by God during this process.<br><br>He eventually risked being killed or subverted. At this point he unilaterally made the choice to fully repent. He made this choice entirely of his own volition, and he never committed sins from then on.<br><br>After he repented, it was revealed to him that he was the Messiah, among other things.<br><br><br>After some time passed, the Tribulation process intensified. The precursors are earthquakes, floods, diseases, terrorism and others.

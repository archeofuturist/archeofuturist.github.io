In the middle-class neighborhood in which I live, I see them, these \u201coppressed\u201d and hard-faced viragoes, strutting down the street in their mink stoles to the next bridge or mah-jongg game, while their husbands are working themselves into an early coronary down in the garment district to support their helpmeets. In these cases, then, who are the \u201cniggers\u201d: the wives or the husbands? The women\u2019s libs claim that men are the masters because they are doing most of the world\u2019s work. But, if we look back at the society of the slave South, who indeed did the work? It is always the slaves who do the work, while the masters live in relative idleness off the fruits of their labor.

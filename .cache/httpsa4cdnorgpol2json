And then all the stereotypes, all the schoolboy one-upmanship comes to the fore. There were no &quot;Portuguese people&quot; under the caliphate, the &quot;Portuguese people&quot; only began existing (on paper) while the Muslims were being expelled. But to think that in the Middle Ages - where feudal and church power was much more important and influential than &quot;state&quot; power - there was such a thing as &quot;national pride&quot; is frankly laughable. And preserving a &quot;culture&quot; is quite relative because Portuguese culture has been many things, and among these many things there are things that contradict each other and can&#039;t be reconciled. The nation-state is the attempt to make a common history shared by people who happened to share a territory and a language (not always) as coherent as possible. It&#039;s an institution like the Church, who burned heretics and centuries later apologised; who excommunicated Teresa d&#039;\u00c1vila and later made her a saint. And we&#039;re supposed to believe there&#039;s a linear, coherent story in all of this.","time":1490246828,"resto":117874835,"id":"AsGuSeVn","country":"PT","country_name":"Portugal"},{"no":117893337,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)01:27:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117877529\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117877529<\/a><br>Immigrants are allowed to vote in England?","time":1490246845,"resto":117874835,"id":"BACsjsuS","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117893583,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)01:29:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117892470\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117892470<\/a><br>Well, to be honest, I feel the same thing about argumentative patriots.","time":1490246978,"resto":117874835,"id":"AsGuSeVn","country":"PT","country_name":"Portugal"}]},{"posts":[{"no":117891976,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)01:14:52","name":"Anonymous","sub":"White","com":"&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;Men&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;","filename":"1490171588400","ext":".jpg","w":720,"h":960,"tn_w":187,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490246092719,"time":1490246092,"md5":"wr3Nq2YOmYf31WDKzrYvJw==","fsize":155808,"resto":0,"id":"by4kMV+m","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"white","country_name":"United States","replies":13,"images":6,"omitted_posts":8,"omitted_images":5},{"no":117893295,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)01:27:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"how can women even compete?","filename":"tumblr_ojbd1dAu7K1v5o53eo1_1280","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":1386,"tn_w":115,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490246820248,"time":1490246820,"md5":"TTRIhgwtARXKphtXuNxYRw==","fsize":436367,"resto":117891976,"id":"k6xewNv3","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":117893377,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)01:27:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;still bigger than mine<\/span>","filename":"9432h3721h74y713d","ext":".png","w":700,"h":431,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":76,"tim":1490246867488,"time":1490246867,"md5":"L+oNCzfEwxDaD2tL9XZxeQ==","fsize":249403,"resto":117891976,"id":"yN5lRNxz","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117893540,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)01:29:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117891976\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117891976<\/a><br>Fuck off back to \/b with this trap shit. &gt;Sage","filename":"1488943452104","ext":".gif","w":514,"h":205,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":49,"tim":1490246958440,"time":1490246958,"md5":"fvXxDgJOCYrOqFtGx9plnQ==","fsize":2147726,"resto":117891976,"id":"5MX8rdnd","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":117893569,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)01:29:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117893377\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117893377<\/a><br>It&#039;s alright, anon.

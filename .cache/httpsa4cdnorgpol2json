His family put him to bed and periodically checked on him but when his father, Kieron, went to see him at 11pm that evening, he found his son had died.<br><br>Lisa Dobbs, a family friend, said Jacks death had been &#039;devastating&#039; for everyone. She added: &#039;Jack was in so much pain he couldn&#039;t even walk across the road to the doctor&#039;s surgery. His mum had to drive him there and they sent him straight to hospital. &#039;When they got home she put him in her bed because all parents know that sleep is the best thing when children are ill. &#039;They kept checking on him, but when his dad went up to check about 11pm, he had passed away.&#039;<br><br>Now friends have set up a JustGiving fundraising page to help Kieron, Jack&#039;s mother Claire, sister Taylor, 23, brother Callum, 19, and younger brother Jamie, 10. A total of \u00a3524 has been raised so far.","filename":"Royal_Glamorgan_Hospital","ext":".jpg","w":633,"h":315,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":124,"tim":1492432900915,"time":1492432900,"md5":"BTLXfthh8Ifc08YFca4nTw==","fsize":38483,"resto":0,"id":"yZEOZxLh","country":"AU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"kid-got-sick-went-to-uks-nhs-hospital-kicked-back","country_name":"Australia","replies":196,"images":29,"omitted_posts":191,"omitted_images":29,"tail_size":50},{"no":121527020,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)09:44:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121523483\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121523483<\/a><br><br>Nah mang, that&#039;s a shitskin holding on to a lighter shitskin.

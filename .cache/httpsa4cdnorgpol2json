With the rise of cultural marxist ideas such as SJWism, cultural appropriation, toxic masculinity, and white privilege, it&#039;s no wonder that white people are choosing to ask the question for the very first time, &quot;why does the color of my skin or my background affect people&#039;s judgment of me?&quot;<br><br>Take me: a former liberal who would chart really far to the left on any political compass prior to 2015. I now end up on the right side, and many of my values of &#039;15 and &#039;16 were killed swiftly when I realized just how toxic the subject of &#039;white people&#039; was becoming. not just by other races, but by white people themselves. They think the jokes about whites are funny, so they parrot them or condone them. Meanwhile, actual havoc is being enacted on the white race in the sense that we&#039;re the only group now acceptable to make fun of along racial lines.<br><br>Has racism against whites caused you to change your views in any way? I voted Trump in 2016 and it was my first Republican vote ever. I&#039;ve renounced many beliefs and dogmas from my lib days and now find myself feeling more at oneness with the world because of it. at the end of the day, hateful anti-white agents caused me to shift to the right, and more towards race realism and unity with my race rather than mankind as a whole.<br><br>(I do not consider myself racist or white supremacist in any way; I also don&#039;t condemn people who do.

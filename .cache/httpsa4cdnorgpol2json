Anything that is processed essentially needs to follow these laws; naturally grown things are inherently kosher. Things that are processed into other things need to be kosher to ensure that the end product has the possibility of being kosher. I say possibility because you can combine kosher ingredients in a non-kosher way; e.g., combing kosher cheese and kosher meat is not kosher.<br><br>Anywho, before industrialization Jews used to know who manufactured their things and this typically worked as a stamp of approval because you need the Jew who Jewed your Jew stuff. Today kosher certs work as a middle man between customers and companies to ensure that products meet kosher standards so that Orthodox Jews will buy it.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;How much money is there in the business?<\/span><br>It depends. The thing is that for something is inherently kosher or has no issue really, it&#039;s pretty cheap. To get kosher tin foil like some anon mentioned it has to pretty much just not use animal grease in manufacture. So, you would literally call the rabbi be like &quot;HEY KIKE-KUN, I WANT THIS CARROT TO BE KOSHER&quot; and they&#039;d be like &quot;lol k, I&#039;ll visit your gay ass farm&quot; and approve it.<br><br>For manufactured things that require substantial processing it&#039;s a bit more complex as you have to guarantee that things like dyes or additives are kosher. The most expensive enterprises are typically meat related because meat butchery standards are extremely tight. So, what you&#039;ll find is that most meats are non-kosher.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Is big kosher a business?<\/span><br>Yes. Costs will vary, but it is a for profit business, the thing is though that the benefits of using kosher tend to actually outweigh the costs of doing it for most things because at scale it&#039;s actually very cheap. Kosher certs are also halal, and appropriate for Seventh Day Adventists. <br><br>1\/2","time":1490458084,"resto":118226944,"id":"nLtVRUpX","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118239578,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)12:14:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118226944\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118226944<\/a><br>t&#039;s a literal form of blackmail.

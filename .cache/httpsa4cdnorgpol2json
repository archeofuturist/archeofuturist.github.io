You need to get your diet in check, stay active, and raise your testosterone. <br><br>DIET<br><br>Drink reverse osmosis or distilled water. (If you do distilled, supplement with minerals.) Avoid drinks with sugar or high fructose corn syrup. Energy drinks are fine but get the zero cal ones. <br><br>Make sure your carbs, proteins, and fats are coming from non-poisoned or non-refined sources. <br><br>Carbs -- get your carbs from clean sources like potatoes, rice, and quinoa. Avoid wheat and sugar at all costs. <br><br>Fats -- get fats from olive oil, nuts, coconut oil, avocado, etc. Avoid hydrogenated oils. <br><br>Protein -- get protein from animals. Bison is packed with more nutrients than beef. Make sure your fish are wild caught and not from sources with mercury. Avoid soy and other processed fake proteins at all costs. <br><br>Veggies and fruits -- get them at your local farmers market and make sure they&#039;re either organic or free of pesticides. <br><br>RAISING TESTOSTERONE<br><br>Get a blood test to see what your level is currently at. Our ancestors had around 1000 ng naturally. To raise it, first try it the natural way, by changing your diet and lifestyle habits. (You can find plenty of info online to do this.) If that does not work -- and it&#039;s still too low -- consider talking to a physician about starting TRT. Under no circumstances should you have low testosterone. <br><br><br>STAYING ACTIVE:<br><br>Whether you lift or practice MMA or ski or jog. Whatever it is you do, you need to make sure of one thing: push the envelope as much as possible. Make it hard on yourself. Embrace pain and suffering, it is what makes you grow. Recover. Then push the envelope even further next time. <br><br>Always remember, if you sit around with your thumb up your ass you are letting the zionists and pedophile ruling class win. They fully intend to create a race of gray sluggish weaklings. The first step in destroying them is to get yourself in order. <br><br>Forge ahead.","filename":"atrazine","ext":".png","w":2490,"h":1625,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":163,"tim":1493570351291,"time":1493570351,"md5":"pBMA52AgxM6VRjOcE43FjA==","fsize":196943,"resto":0,"id":"SbieX39i","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"reminder-transgenderism-is-caused-by-chemical","country_name":"United States","replies":244,"images":43,"omitted_posts":239,"omitted_images":43,"tail_size":50},{"no":123538464,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)18:41:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123537632\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123537632<\/a><br>no, I&#039;m referring to Tree King but with the skyking style thing from the yanknukebomba threads<br><br>but you&#039;re quite correct. before YT stoal dey nigurz fly inn pirruurmidz dey WUZ skykangz","time":1493592118,"resto":123495471,"id":"eiK3UHrT","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123538843,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)18:45:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123538451\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123538451<\/a><br>((()))","time":1493592309,"resto":123495471,"id":"urssp+79","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123539878,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)18:53:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;A 2002 study by Tyrone Hayes, of the University of California, Berkeley, found that exposure caused male tadpoles to turn into hermaphrodites \u2013 frogs with both male and female sexual characteristics<\/span><br>Holy shit.","time":1493592829,"resto":123495471,"id":"FaZb2jSO","country":"DK","country_name":"Denmark"},{"no":123540167,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)18:56:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123495471\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123495471<\/a><br>Sauce on this?

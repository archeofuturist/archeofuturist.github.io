Mind you she was 16 and this dude was 19, while I myself was 11.<br><br>She told me to put on a suit, light up some candles on the dinner table and microwave a TV dinner. I didn&#039;t have a suit so I put on my dad&#039;s which was oversized, even if I was pretty big for my age and did as she asked. I love my sister so I didn&#039;t question much but when she wanted to practice kissing after eating I got a little nervous so I backed out a little. We ended up doing that thing the dogs did in Lady &amp; the Tramp which made it a little less awkward<br><br>My sister had never had sex before, and obviously neither had I. She had no real formal sex education but had seen a porno flick after sneaking into the theater last year. I&#039;m guessing that&#039;s where her knowledge came from because she had some pretty detailed requests, asking me to take off her bra and rub her breast, and in turn she would take off my pants and poke my weiner. We went to her bedroom and she gently tied me to the frame with her bra and took off her underwear. I didn&#039;t know what was going on and I didn&#039;t have any real sexual attraction to my sister but she got on top of me and slid it in her vagina. She told me that she&#039;d do all the work because I didn&#039;t know how and kinda started jumping up and down on my semi. This scared my penis a bit so it became flaccid and she was tired from all the movement so she kinda just laid on top of me with my penis in her for about thirty minutes before she told me to release. I thought she meant pee because I didn&#039;t know how to ejaculate yet so I peed inside her and then she cancelled her date because she thought sex was gross.

Girls have been pampered growing up, and given everything that they&#039;ve wanted; everything that they&#039;ve asked for. <br><br><br>This creates a huge problem for society later on. These women graduate college, move out of the house, and eventually have to get married and start a family. <br><br>Well, Who&#039;s gonna pay for all this shit now? Because I&#039;ll tell you what, their boyfriends and husbands won&#039;t be able to afford it. At least not at first. Theyre gonna have to sacrifice some of these things at the beginning if they want to build a life with someone. If they want to build a family. If they want to be rich later on down the road. <br><br>So what do these girls do? They realize the true value of a dollar. Some of them get a degree and work hard. Some of them work hard and sacrifice. <br><br>But a far larger number of women these days don&#039;t do that. They become gold diggers. They go after rich guys with money instead of guys that truly care about them, and they get fucked over. And that&#039;s when the true cancer reveals itself, because then they become radical, man-hating feminists; complaining about a mythical wage gap that doesn&#039;t exist. They become these man hating, selfish creatures all in the name of money. All in the name of greed. <br><br>And thus you see the state of society today. The breakdown of traditional culture, a war between the sexes.

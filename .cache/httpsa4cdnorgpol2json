First, I&#039;m not sure that is obviously racist. Secondly, Europeans created western civilization, currently maintain it, and ARE it. It&#039;s like saying you could separate Romans from Roman civilization.<br><br>He also seems to think the importation of other races isn&#039;t having a deleterious effect on western civilization when it is, empirically so in fact. He&#039;s just straight up lying and virtue signalling at this point.<br><br>He goes on to conflate the American Constitution with western civilization which is profoundly idiotic and is clear sophistry.

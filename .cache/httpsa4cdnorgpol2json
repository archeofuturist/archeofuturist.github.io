So it&#039;s sometimes a bit hard to tell what they put on easterners for being desert simpletons and muslims for being dicks but for what I could gather, their overall view is that muslims are authoritarian dicks who want everything to go their way and cry foul whenever they can&#039;t manage to subjugate someone. Needless to say they did that a lot under Assad who did not do much concessions to them. The bulrry part comes when they do stuff like call muslims uneducated and violent, because it&#039;s also something they say a lot about kurds and easterners who are closer to Iraqi culture.<br>Add to that a LOT of shit they got from muslims in Lebanon (where they had to stay until they got asylum granted to join France where one of their sons works) like sunni officials &quot;losing&quot; their transfer files after reading they are christians, multiple times, etc.","time":1491219861,"resto":119317428,"id":"LKuYwiRj","country":"FR","country_name":"France"}]},{"posts":[{"no":119312147,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)05:51:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"kek","filename":"038584","ext":".jpg","w":1624,"h":1100,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":169,"tim":1491213106225,"time":1491213106,"md5":"ZBR6BKy+vSbDTKCZBsqlbg==","fsize":276479,"resto":0,"id":"gi\/TIq\/r","country":"NO","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"kek","country_name":"Norway","replies":75,"images":25,"omitted_posts":70,"omitted_images":24},{"no":119318715,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)07:42:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119313035\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119313035<\/a><br>Aye but king Tut was ethnically Western European DNA testing shows tbf.","time":1491219742,"resto":119312147,"id":"7jHf+whn","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119318719,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)07:42:25","name":"Anonymous","filename":"WE48","ext":".png","w":1016,"h":565,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":69,"tim":1491219745631,"time":1491219745,"md5":"77gmUpA5Nc8D3Rm34nsa1A==","fsize":114557,"resto":119312147,"id":"gi\/TIq\/r","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":119318824,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)07:43:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119313470\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119313470<\/a><br>Numibians did actually.","time":1491219833,"resto":119312147,"id":"7jHf+whn","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119318847,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)07:44:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"BLEACHED","filename":"nintchdbpict000251653877-e1468350631101","ext":".jpg","w":648,"h":961,"tn_w":84,"tn_h":124,"tim":1491219850935,"time":1491219850,"md5":"UxUpx\/9\/wYkCACxNwq0e2g==","fsize":100852,"resto":119312147,"id":"gi\/TIq\/r","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":119318857,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)07:44:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119312380\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119312380<\/a><br>exactly this...in a couple hundred years they will be mad that a white person is playing a swede","time":1491219860,"resto":119312147,"id":"n\/+ro\/rz","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":119311625,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)05:42:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"It&#039;s Nigel&#039;s birthday!<br>He&#039;s 53 today.<br><br>Say happy birthday, Nigel","filename":"17760135_1302911323089801_7706121803246006246_n","ext":".jpg","w":720,"h":960,"tn_w":187,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491212557697,"time":1491212557,"md5":"uPVbBiwuflsNTVbCq1lYnA==","fsize":76610,"resto":0,"id":"t8Xl9a1+","country":"AU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"its-nigels-birthday","country_name":"Australia","replies":99,"images":29,"omitted_posts":94,"omitted_images":29},{"no":119318481,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)07:38:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"Happy birthday Nigel.

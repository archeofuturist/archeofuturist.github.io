Refugees are not survivalists. To the chagrin of whatever people get stuck with feeding them, they&#039;re totally dependent upon other people to live. Living off the land isn&#039;t living like a subhuman; it&#039;s living like a human. What you do (and most of humanity) is living like a spoiled human. If things ever get hard for any reason, you will be the refugee that&#039;s totally dependent upon others for mere survival.

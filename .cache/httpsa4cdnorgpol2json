You need someone who&#039;s old, respected, and has a good working relationship with the DA. Typically, this means they handle general criminal defense and haven&#039;t specialized in DUI.<br><br>Now, since you were actually charged, your deferred prosecution is not going to be 100% perfect: most employers are going to want to know if you were ever charged with a crime, so its up to you to decide if you want to tell them the truth.<br><br>Some clients, though, I can get perfect deferred adjudication for. These are the clients who know they committed a crime, who suspect that they&#039;re going to get caught, and who come to me before they&#039;ve been charged with anything. With these clients, the deferred adjudication I can get for them is more of a gentleman&#039;s agreement between the prosecutor and me to not even bring any charges as long as the client stays out of trouble and maybe does some other stuff (restitution to any victims, etc.) Since you&#039;ve got a court date and all that, that&#039;s not on the table, but you can still get the next best thing if you play your cards right.","time":1492423013,"resto":121503653,"id":"1uI7DNl\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121508372,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)06:04:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121507804\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121507804<\/a><br>They never gave me a court date.<br>First offence, they just booked me and let me go within two hours.<br>I can&#039;t afford an actual lawyer, so I&#039;m probably going to have to get a public defender.. but like I said; I don&#039;t drive often, and have never owned a vehicle, can this work out to my advantage?<br>In your opinion, how do you think I&#039;ll be charged?","time":1492423465,"resto":121503653,"id":"7OsSg3f7","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121508554,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)06:06:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"the courts dont care if you drive often senpai.. all first offense duis are the same with public defenders","time":1492423594,"resto":121503653,"id":"65RG1YuR","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121509153,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)06:14:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"I just scored a DUI in January.<br><br>Get ready to get gangfucked by everyone.

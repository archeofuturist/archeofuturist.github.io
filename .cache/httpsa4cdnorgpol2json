I mean it&#039;s just boot camp right?<br> It doesn&#039;t affect your career rite? Fast forward 7 years later and I&#039;m applying for a public trust clearance to build the Wall for the Donald\/enforce the Muslim ban and they&#039;re requesting my military paperwork. It doesn&#039;t matter that most of the team they&#039;re hiring for this isn&#039;t born in the US, mostly foriegn indians and such, they&#039;re preparing to deny my clearance regardless for my psych issues. The REU paper in my discharge papers is the nastiest, most mean spirited thing I&#039;ve ever read in my entire life, including stuff such as &quot;my boots smelled bad&quot; etc. Now they&#039;re requesting my entire psych history from the past 7 years and they&#039;re probably going to deny my clearance based on that. At this point I&#039;m probably moving out of the country after living in DC my entire life and seeing government corruption everywhere, I&#039;m like fuck america and fuck the military at this point but let this be a lesson to you all - if you ever join the military, don&#039;t tell them a fucking thing. No matter what they say, they&#039;re just going to use it against you. Do NOT trust a military psychologist, don&#039;t believe a goddamn thing the recruiter says, do not seek mental health help from ANYONE without knowing that everything you say can and will be used against you later. If you have a condition like I have and you have to take pills, remember that it&#039;s going to be used against you to discriminate against you. If you have a psych problem, or just don&#039;t want to be made to look bad later, don&#039;t join the military at all. It doesn&#039;t matter that you aren&#039;t holding a gun, if you have psych problems the government views you as less than human. Doctor patient confidentiality does not exist. Most of you will continue sucking military cock but whatever, you have been warned.","filename":"join-the-marine-corps-they-said-itll-be-fun-they-505207","ext":".png","w":500,"h":511,"tn_w":244,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492802860996,"time":1492802860,"md5":"RuJIiPWmATsnr9pRgMWG5g==","fsize":157997,"resto":0,"id":"c7UMro1t","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"dont-join-the-military","country_name":"United States","replies":186,"images":24,"omitted_posts":181,"omitted_images":24,"tail_size":50},{"no":122184298,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)16:57:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122176001\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122176001<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I&#039;m too much of a pussy to do a real mans job so I&#039;ll write tickets instead<\/span><br><br>Sounds like you fit the bill perfectly.","time":1492808258,"resto":122173636,"id":"XVMmQ3iV","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122184385,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)16:58:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122183665\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122183665<\/a><br>Idk man I&#039;ve got friends in the trade who had an easy time finding a job and making a decent wage once they got in. <br><br><a href=\"#p122183694\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122183694<\/a><br>I was on the Montgomery GI Bill not the post 9\/11.

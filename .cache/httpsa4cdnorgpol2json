Satanism is the pursue of the material desires and self over the spiritual, the divine. <br><br>6 is the number of man, and his weakness. greed, egoism, egocentrism, all the materialistic desires, and i believe of this plane existence in general. 666 is going over the top with the materialistic desires, pursuing and desiring only those and making you follow the path of satan, and since with atheism they completely got rid of the spiritual, all thats left is the material.","filename":"saturn northpole","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":1024,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492689045124,"time":1492689045,"md5":"gnCzAeqyh11zhYWbdmLyeg==","fsize":163997,"resto":0,"id":"dXb74l5J","country":"DE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"atheism-is-satanism-in-disguise","country_name":"Germany","replies":57,"images":19,"omitted_posts":52,"omitted_images":18},{"no":121992990,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)09:10:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121990616\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121990616<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;leaf<\/span>","filename":"rakish","ext":".jpg","w":389,"h":605,"tn_w":80,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492693820575,"time":1492693820,"md5":"Rm2iscpsT2VQ3wbNrKQpSA==","fsize":66319,"resto":121986668,"id":"7V220kSz","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121993239,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)09:13:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121992646\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121992646<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;a test? why a test? he knows (he is omniscient after all). there is logically no point in a test, because tests are made to gather information, but an omniscient god already has access to that information<\/span><br>because of the free will. he knows what will happen, and how we decide, but to make us decide he has to put us into a position where we have to decide first. if there would never be a way to decide wrongly there would be no free will, and if god would solve all our problems for us than what good is humanity? this live isnt for god, its for us. we are supposed to live, gather knowledge and experience, find out who we actually are and what we stand for. this wont happen without any struggle, without the opportunity to do the wrong thing to then reject that opportunity. we are supposed to find out who we are, and whatever this is will be judged.","time":1492694019,"resto":121986668,"id":"dXb74l5J","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":121993710,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)09:19:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121993239\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121993239<\/a><br>yes, but he would already know what we would have chose if he had allowed the evil, why put us through evil it in the first place?","time":1492694358,"resto":121986668,"id":"l1yt8X+1","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":121993947,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)09:22:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121991662\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121991662<\/a><br><br>As if God and the Angels are not fascists themselves. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;go to hell if evil<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;go to heaven if good<\/span><br><br>Your story sounds good but the real reason for war is Christianity and Mudslimes fighting each other.

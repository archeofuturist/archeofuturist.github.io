Hispanics have a shit ton of mixed blood simply because of the culture instituted by spanish colonists who didnt have nearly as much of a racial caste.<br><br>Here&#039;s the real stats. 30pc of people who identified as white on the census had African ancestry (an average of 2.3%).

Americans had, and honestly still have, the best culture of any white country. Strong 1st and 2nd amendments. White americans are probably higher testosterone than western europeans who will probably spam the 56pc meme in this thread. But that doesn&#039;t change the fact that no other western euro white country would have elected Trump.<br><br>To end, I think thisalso highlights how wrong the nordic superiority meme is. Pure nordic countries are feminist shitholes like Sweden and Iceland. The English are hardly genetically different than nords but have a much better culture. For example, if I were an Old Stock american living in 1800, i would not want swedish or german immigrants unless they converted to protestantism and integrated (like they used to). Nowadays borders have been flooded with pablos and muslims (like me). I&#039;ve been reading the bible and trying to change my name, but the fact remains that nonwhites are harder to integrate in the USA and Canada, only made worse by the fact that immigration quotas have exploded over the past 20 years. If im not wrong, Canada used to be 90pc white in 1995, now its on the verge of dropping below 70pc. It really is sad, but I&#039;m hoping communism rises again and islam gets more powerful (more terrorist attacks etc) to act as evil that will polarize the usa and europe to return them to more alpha cultures. Accelerationism outside white countries with side effects in white countries is the real redpill.

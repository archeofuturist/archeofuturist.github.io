For example conservatives follow the base instinct of kin selection, where they give preference to those who are most genetically similar to them (which gives rise to racism and xenophobia). Liberals are more intellectually enlightened and realize that race and ethnicity are social constructs, and that we&#039;re all part of the same human species and that we should all share equally with each other and not give preference to those more genetically similar to us:<br><br>Even though past studies show that women are more liberal than men, and blacks are more liberal than whites, the effect of childhood intelligence on adult political ideology is twice as large as the effect of either sex or race. So it appears that, as the Hypothesis predicts, more intelligent individuals are more likely to espouse the value of liberalism than less intelligent individuals, possibly because liberalism is evolutionarily novel and conservatism is evolutionarily familiar.","filename":"1488689709430","ext":".png","w":1280,"h":1483,"tn_w":215,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491280725663,"time":1491280725,"md5":"cRYYLXCEpTYLrNnqmhvXCg==","fsize":60038,"resto":0,"id":"\/qLGLaGh","country":"IN","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"numerous-scientific-studies-have-shown-that","country_name":"India","replies":36,"images":6,"omitted_posts":31,"omitted_images":5},{"no":119435884,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)01:29:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119431950\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119431950<\/a><br><br>I think you dropped this before you got here.......","filename":"crystal_crack_pipe","ext":".jpg","w":1110,"h":681,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":76,"tim":1491283747065,"time":1491283747,"md5":"jEkphwm0nxJP4YFfUXR82g==","fsize":41138,"resto":119431630,"id":"B3C+00Cs","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":119436054,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)01:31:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"You guys will go down swinging, I give you that.

The employer must now pay more for no benefit, causing a decrease in profit. This is either offset by prices increasing to make up for it or people be laid off. Those employed don&#039;t get to make use of their new money due to price increases or lose their job in some situations. Additionally it makes it harder for people to get jobs, especially if they have not had one before.

The question would have been, had history witnessed the natural death of Hitler and a succession, whether or not factions within the NSDAP would have tolerated the succession order Hitler ordained, or attempted a coup. The reason to suspect this was possible was that the party had experienced such factionalized conflicts before, culminating in the Night of Long Knives. However, following that event, the party was no longer factionalized, and became far more formal in its hierarchy. Different figureheads of different departments might have had power-struggles, and it would have boiled down to whether or not the members of the party felt they had more of a stake in stable continuity or power. The various &quot;governorships&quot; of conquered territories would more likely have declared themselves separate spheres of influence, than that there would have been a coup in Germany proper.","time":1491873973,"resto":120510776,"id":"THY15FOu","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120527936,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)21:28:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"one more question: can there be national socialism without a racial element?","filename":"Al2xpP","ext":".png","w":506,"h":443,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":109,"tim":1491874095361,"time":1491874095,"md5":"ICGR7y\/Uuf55OxBL3p0OVg==","fsize":154615,"resto":120510776,"id":"nPjHMn6z","country":"JP","country_name":"Japan"},{"no":120528148,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)21:29:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120527936\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120527936<\/a><br>No. Literally one of the core elements of NS is that a ethnostate is to be established.","time":1491874168,"resto":120510776,"id":"VRXVUY0Z","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120528188,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)21:29:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120527592\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120527592<\/a><br>Hitler would not have retired into old age without leaving behind a firm constitution for the people to follow.<br>The U.S is able to follow its constitution somewhat and it would be this way for nat soc Germany as well except with the added support of having Hitlers speeches immortalized in video\/audio forever which is a step above the U.S constitution.","time":1491874183,"resto":120510776,"id":"nBp7aJHI","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]},{"posts":[{"no":120521227,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)20:44:14","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Good goy WH spokesman slips and tells truth","com":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Hamosh84\/status<wbr>\/851558316484558848","filename":"Untitled","ext":".png","w":512,"h":506,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":247,"tim":1491871454826,"time":1491871454,"md5":"OyxCFVq8DWqBCyengmgwmQ==","fsize":350933,"resto":0,"id":"PNAauR0E","country":"PL","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"good-goy-wh-spokesman-slips-and-tells-truth","country_name":"Poland","replies":160,"images":39,"omitted_posts":155,"omitted_images":37,"tail_size":50},{"no":120527929,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)21:28:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120527138\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120527138<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;IF YOU SAY MEAN THINGS ABOUT TRUMP YOU&#039;RE A SHILL!!!<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;STOP BEING MEAN TO MY GOD EMPOROR1!!!!!111<\/span>","time":1491874094,"resto":120521227,"id":"t2dWRY+G","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":120527930,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)21:28:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120521491\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120521491<\/a>","filename":"1486619626082","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":860,"tn_w":72,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491874094460,"time":1491874094,"md5":"+B8w2ebusgTIi2qtcSszeA==","fsize":149741,"resto":120521227,"id":"bAKTFcdS","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120528021,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)21:28:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120521491\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120521491<\/a><br>Fuck off","time":1491874127,"resto":120521227,"id":"hRupTz76","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120528033,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)21:28:51","name":"Anonymous5","com":"<a href=\"#p120521227\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120521227<\/a><br><br>I&#039;ve made threads talking about this recently:<br><br>http:\/\/archive.4plebs.org\/pol\/searc<wbr>h\/subject\/knowledge%20bomb\/username<wbr>\/anonymous5\/tripcode\/%21%219O2tecpD<wbr>HQ6\/","filename":"Pyramidz","ext":".jpg","w":1000,"h":667,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1491874131158,"time":1491874131,"md5":"VJfTrDSEn1je8f7y\/rdkig==","fsize":162883,"resto":120521227,"id":"+8iymGSj","country":"US","trip":"!!9O2tecpDHQ6","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120528187,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)21:29:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120527808\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120527808<\/a><br>Oh (you)...","time":1491874183,"resto":120521227,"id":"g+u4BdyH","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":120505416,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)18:47:31","name":"Anonymous","sub":"You have SM powers, what do you to the political\/racial factors?","com":"You are strong enough to lift A mountain, fast enough to be on the other side of the world in minutes, nothing on earth can hurt you; x-ray vision, super hearing allows you to locate anything or anyone with ease.<br><br>With these powers what would you do to shape the current world?

I was a young CIA officer, called by September 11 to serve, and found myself amid generals and sheikhs, writing for presidents\u2014the life I\u2019d dreamed of since childhood. Drained by 18-hour days and fitful sleep, my demons flooded the moments of peace. In the dark, I heard fighting beyond the wall, thought of friends killed and wounded, and remembered my secret. You feel explosions before you hear them, and there was a bomb at the center of my life that no one could see. I was transgender, and feared I would lose my family and friendships. It was before an Executive Order protected transgender employees, and I imagined myself ridiculed or fired if I admitted the truth. I had heard a story about what happened to one CIA officer who had taken that step:<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;Once upon a time, an officer with decades of experience lost it; clearly the stress. One day he decided he was now a woman\u2014hilarious I know\u2014and wanted everyone to believe him. Management didn&#039;t know what to do with the transsexual. CIA had only just accepted gays; the officer left the Agency.&quot; When I was a child I knew that trans-people existed, but I knew I couldn\u2019t possibly be one of them. I was going to make history, not be some freak on television. My self-discipline and self-hatred marched in lock-step. I bottled up my problem, and tried to live up to the CIA&#039;s values: to \u201cput mission before self\u201d and \u201cgo where others cannot.\u201d But CIA has other chiseled words: \u201cthe truth shall set you free.\u201d How could I speak truth to power but not be honest with myself?<\/span>","filename":"7606627b70eb931a50521d6b996966f638839867ba167b4b91b8ec1b6d5c061d[1]","ext":".png","w":1054,"h":806,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":191,"tim":1490088036296,"time":1490088036,"md5":"uFZI1pcXITGQVwOF\/lnC3w==","fsize":202311,"resto":0,"id":"TwCCv53O","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"wikileaks-tweets-about-the-cias-hiring-of","country_name":"United States","replies":7,"images":0,"omitted_posts":2,"omitted_images":0},{"no":117608487,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)05:22:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;My life as a trans CIA officer has made me privy to state secrets: Women pay more for dry cleaning. Chocolate is amazing on estrogen. My email is filled with yogurt ads and warnings that my fertility window is closing. One last reveal: No one cares that I&#039;m trans. Defecting from Brooks Brothers to Ann Taylor had no impact on my ability to update the president on events overseas. In fact, without the fear of losing my clearance or exhaustion from pretending to be male, I became a better intelligence officer. Migrating from man to woman, I learned the social codes of both camps, and was forced to confront my own prejudices and assumptions. Indeed, self-awareness, humility, and the courage to speak unpopular truths are core principles of intelligence tradecraft. I have been to war and changed genders; I don\u2019t fear the next mission.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Active-duty CIA officers do not talk about their work in the papers, and my friends would tell you that being trans is the least interesting thing about me. I\u2019ve had a marvelous career in the years since I transitioned, seeing the world, and doing the work I love. But when my past starts fading into memory, I&#039;m jolted by reminders that our country has a long way to go. The support I received from CIA draws a damning contrast to the treatment of other transgender Americans. If trans soldiers can serve in Afghanistan and Iraq, and LGBT intelligence officers can risk their lives hunting terrorists, why are trans teens like Gavin Grimm still fighting in court for the right to pee?

Without any anesthetics, Mengele cut him open and removed his kidney. &quot;I saw the kidney pulsing in his hand and cried like a crazy man,&quot; Ganon says. &quot;I screamed the &#039;Shema Yisrael.&#039; I begged for death, to stop the suffering.&quot;<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;After the &quot;operation,&quot; he had to work in the Auschwitz sewing room without painkillers. Among other things, he had to clean bloody medical instruments. Once, he had to spend the whole night in a bath of ice-cold water because Mengele wanted to &quot;test&quot; his lung function. Altogether, Ganon spent six and a half months in the concentration camp&#039;s hospital.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;When they had no more use for him, the Nazis sent him to the gas chamber.

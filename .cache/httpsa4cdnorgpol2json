Le Pen runs this debate for the entire two hours - it&#039;s like watching Pence\/Kane again, only better. She gets in two very memorable jabs, one where she calls him out for fucking his teacher and another where she says &quot; a woman will lead France, either me or Mrs. Merkel.&quot; He stutters repeatedly and repeats dumb lines constantly and seems off topic, irritated, and generally full of shit. If you actually understand the policy topics you know that she dismantled him completely on each one. He frequently tries to wave his hands and jedi mind trick and she is ready for it and throws it back at him. This was the strongest debate performance I&#039;ve ever seen and one she needed. She even dangled a line about &quot;let&#039;s hope we don&#039;t find out you have a secret bank account in the Bahamas&quot; because she obviously knows about the big leak of his secret Caribbean bank account that&#039;s about to hit. She&#039;s running against an even stronger propaganda campaign than Trump was so she has to get everything right and get some luck to win and this debate is her getting everything right. If she does not win tonight and France is still holding elections after 5 years of Macron she&#039;ll win then. She absolutely exposed him as a pissant joke and schooled him on every single issue. He called her &quot;stupid&quot; repeatedly and made other derogatory remarks that would get him absolutely fucking shredded by US feminists. The French are watching and she changed a ton of minds today and redpilled a bunch of motherfuckers. Ignore all shills - I understand French politics, understand French, and understand what I saw with my own two eyes. Only the most deluded propaganda victim could see this as anything but a devastating ass-whooping laid down by Le Pen on Macron.","filename":"1492903836842","ext":".png","w":657,"h":527,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":200,"tim":1493868819229,"time":1493868819,"md5":"dSOBA3aVoeBfNgTcvuWmrg==","fsize":36227,"resto":0,"id":"J2SAI8FU","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"marine-le-pen-absoluely-destroyed-macron-in","country_name":"United States","replies":71,"images":18,"omitted_posts":66,"omitted_images":18},{"no":124025537,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)01:38:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124012070\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124012070<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;dubbed<\/span><br>Kys amerifatty","time":1493876315,"resto":124012070,"id":"4vpktrLa","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":124025558,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)01:38:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124012070\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124012070<\/a><br>anybody who watched it can OBJECTIVELY tell me who won ?","time":1493876328,"resto":124012070,"id":"321pXwwv","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":124025999,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)01:43:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"I like how every french people itt tell us marine lost but all those fat dumb retarded american who havent watched the debate tell us she won and call anybody who disagree a shill<br><br>the usual pol thread","time":1493876613,"resto":124012070,"id":"321pXwwv","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":124026027,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)01:43:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124025369\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124025369<\/a><br>If his men told him to do that, they should be fired and hanged ASAP !

Example: I go a week of eating healthy\/lifting. I gradually get stressed out about this throughout the week. On my weekend I allow myself the &quot;reward&quot; of gorging myself on pizza donuts and ice cream. Afterwards instead of feeling happier\/less stressed I actually feel let down and depressed.<br><br>If my goals are things like: go to college, get fit, effectively use my time, create art, then why are my dopaminergic reward systems not tied to those goals, and are instead associating that behavior with stress or anxiety? I TRULY want those things. I truly want to be that person. So why are my emotions not tied into those things the way you would expect? Does my brain require more time to rewire itself? I don&#039;t understand why my brain is associating the things I actually want in life with negativity. Does part of me not believe I can actually DO it, and therefore has a sort of phobia associated with positive behavior?","filename":"jordan peterson","ext":".jpg","w":300,"h":168,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1493872604317,"time":1493872604,"md5":"I0iS+q+p8+t5U9PxFNovnQ==","fsize":6353,"resto":0,"id":"yqWJZabi","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-last-few-weeks-since-i-started-watching","country_name":"United States","replies":60,"images":7,"omitted_posts":55,"omitted_images":7},{"no":124025376,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)01:36:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124020436\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124020436<\/a><br>Also to add more to my response to this:<br><br>Dr. Peterson also talks about exceptional individuals with the capacity to &quot;think their being forward&quot;. <br><br>I think what he&#039;s implying is that some people (or all people) have some ability to, instead of literally living out the bad decisions and having to suffer the consequences in order to &quot;delve into the underworld&quot;, through empathetic meditation and reflection, THINK their way through the underworld and learn the lessons associated with slaying that particular dragon through proxy.

You have to make a deliberate effort for that to happen. Start with basic conditioning, every time you do something that advances your goals, reward yourself with something nice. Reserve that reward just for this purpose. If you fail to take action or sabotage your own goals, punish yourself. Any punishment will do, throw away money, eat something you hate, ask someone to punch you in the stomach. Do this consistently. <br><br>The next step is to modify your patterns of thinking. First you need to rationalize why you want what you want and why you are doing what you are doing. The best way to approach this is through self-authoring exercices. Write about your past experiences, write about your present feelings, write about various future scenarios. There&#039;s a very high chance your views and goals will change during this process. Learning about yourself is an ongoing exercise, you never really stop doing it, but it&#039;s the only way to build pull motivation (when you can&#039;t help but want to work on something at all times) instead of push motivation (brief spurts of effort like the one you described working out).","time":1493876534,"resto":124019134,"id":"Vv41gLKb","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":124026101,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)01:44:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124025233\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124025233<\/a><br>and? if you&#039;re a black man born in America you will be lucky to see 65.

This type of structure offers a much more intellectual-based dialog in which points can be refuted with facts and highlighted to be seen by many.

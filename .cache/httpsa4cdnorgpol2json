The left seeks to eliminate selection (egalitarianism, wealth redistribution) and the authoritarian right would eliminate variation (muh degeneracy). I identify as libertarian because it allows both elements necessary for social and economic progress. I think the ex-libertarian part comes from abandoning parts of libertarianism that are perceived as giving leftists a weakness to exploit, for example open borders being used to import shitloads of low skill workers who form liberal voting blocks. You can only hear liberals say &quot;demography is destiny&quot; so many times before you realize they&#039;re dead serious.","filename":"1482440043715","ext":".jpg","w":350,"h":510,"tn_w":85,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492692214875,"time":1492692214,"md5":"Grgt9kOmL7ZEeTtVnczXQQ==","fsize":92705,"resto":121985402,"id":"BKULH1\/0","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121990967,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)08:44:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"Libertarianism is unsustainable in a democracy in which a significant part of the population has become authoritarian leftist.","time":1492692272,"resto":121985402,"id":"OGFRNdOi","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":121926388,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)20:55:23","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Give me your best Jewish names","filename":"1490908222449","ext":".jpg","w":724,"h":844,"tn_w":214,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492649723463,"time":1492649723,"md5":"AO+M0DZ8FxpJ9LVvtvdgWA==","fsize":261590,"resto":0,"id":"SCT0RMME","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"give-me-your-best-jewish-names","country_name":"United States","replies":246,"images":37,"omitted_posts":241,"omitted_images":36,"tail_size":50},{"no":121989758,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)08:27:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121926388\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121926388<\/a><br>Jesus christ","time":1492691242,"resto":121926388,"id":"BFITmxdX","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":121990168,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)08:33:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121930907\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121930907<\/a><br>Rollex oregano","filename":"1492605898537","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":768,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1492691583502,"time":1492691583,"md5":"EzdhcCjYvuvFa2+BBm+EBg==","fsize":144736,"resto":121926388,"id":"dy4RlcSG","country":"CZ","country_name":"Czech Republic"},{"no":121990211,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)08:33:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121930907\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121930907<\/a><br>Me too","time":1492691618,"resto":121926388,"id":"yY58Ut+e","country":"NZ","country_name":"New Zealand"},{"no":121990450,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)08:37:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121930907\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121930907<\/a><br>Roll","time":1492691833,"resto":121926388,"id":"XXg2Cyr1","country":"CY","country_name":"Cyprus"},{"no":121990964,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)08:44:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121930907\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121930907<\/a><br>f","time":1492692269,"resto":121926388,"id":"JZJZFkVZ","country":"AT","country_name":"Austria"}]},{"posts":[{"no":121978854,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)06:11:26","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Who benefits from all this","com":"Increase of violence, growing political discourse<br><br>It is only going to get worse after Berkeley<br><br>All it takes is a few fools and it will escalate, with fatalities and serious consequences <br><br>Ask yourself, who benefits from this? <br>Expansion of state power<br>Further restriction on personal freedoms","filename":"Berkeley","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":360,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1492683086203,"time":1492683086,"md5":"GVfU8snj1FUTF+uK4joC4w==","fsize":51443,"resto":0,"id":"gYqB8qcx","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"who-benefits-from-all-this","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":55,"images":7,"omitted_posts":50,"omitted_images":7},{"no":121990084,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)08:31:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121989487\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121989487<\/a><br>Reading The Gulag Archipelago recommended by Peterson.

The Turks of Asia Minor had since 1263 been raiding and expanding into Byzantine territory in Asia Minor. Anatolia, which had formed the very heart of the shrinking empire, was systematically lost to numerous Turkic ghazis, whose raids evolved into conquering expeditions inspired by Islamic zeal. With a decreasing source of food and manpower, the Palaiologoi were forced to fight on several fronts, most of them being Christian states: the Second Bulgarian Empire, the Serbian Empire, the remnants of the Latin Empire and even the Knights Hospitaller.<br><br>The loss of land in the east to the Turks and in the west to the Bulgarians was complemented by two disastrous civil wars, the Black Death and the 1354 earthquake at Gallipoli, whose destruction and evacuation allowed the Turks to occupy it. By 1380, the Byzantine Empire consisted of the capital Constantinople and a few other isolated exclaves, which only nominally recognized the Emperor as their lord. Nonetheless, Byzantine diplomacy coupled with the adroit exploitation of internal divisions and external threats among their enemies, and above all the invasion of Anatolia by Timur, allowed Byzantium to survive until 1453. The last remnants of the Byzantine Empire, the Despotate of the Morea and the Empire of Trebizond, fell shortly afterwards.&quot;<br><br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Byzan<wbr>tine_Empire_under_the_Palaiologos_d<wbr>ynasty","time":1492692215,"resto":121985964,"id":"GjHRSwn6","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121990914,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)08:43:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121989046\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121989046<\/a><br>forgetting about the massacre of the latins I see","time":1492692217,"resto":121985964,"id":"eqCS+gW3","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121990960,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)08:44:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121986775\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121986775<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;not turning it into the Roman Empire and reclaiming lost land<\/span><br>Why","time":1492692267,"resto":121985964,"id":"NgSLh6rW","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":121990045,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)08:31:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"Refute this shit<br><br>Protip: you can&#039;t","filename":"monopoly of life","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":704,"tn_w":227,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492691474662,"time":1492691474,"md5":"owEJWz29HefYlh2tFVwctg==","fsize":90885,"resto":0,"id":"xRtDHDqv","country":"AU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"refute-this-shit","country_name":"Australia","replies":21,"images":4,"omitted_posts":16,"omitted_images":4},{"no":121990896,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)08:43:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121990045\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121990045<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I have to beat the 1%<\/span><br>Why?

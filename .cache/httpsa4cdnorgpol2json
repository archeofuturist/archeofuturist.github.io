She&#039;s developed an insatiable craving for your dick and you&#039;ve likewise developed a taste for her pussy. You\u2019re both cooped up in an attic all day have nothing better to do besides fuck like an unsustainable third world population. You lie down on your back, she strips off her almost comically too small clothes and kneels on top of you. She grabs a hold of your rock hard cock, inserts it deep inside of her, and begins to ride you like a stallion. You feel the pressure from her incredible weight and huge round belly bearing down on you but the indescribable pleasure of her tight pussy throbbing on you cock negates any discomfort. You sink into her beautiful soul, into that secret place where no one dares to go. After 30 minutes, you and her are both moaning with ever greater intensity, you know it won&#039;t be long now. Suddenly, you feel your cock shaking like a V-2 rocket and the orgasm reaches it&#039;s climax as your cum literally explodes like an 88mm AT round inside her Sherman tank, blowing the turret right off. You and her both join as one, souls screaming from the sheer ecstasy. As the elation wears off, she lies next to you. Too exhausted to do anything else, you simply hold her in your embrace. In that moment, there is no family squabbles, no Nazis, no war. Just you and her, watching the sky turn pink with the setting sun.","filename":"AnneFrank_001-ALT","ext":".jpg","w":687,"h":1117,"tn_w":76,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493673148860,"time":1493673148,"md5":"qzTnFSg45ME5mVWg4W1rCA==","fsize":543677,"resto":123672086,"id":"auc6t4Kh","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":123673929,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)17:13:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123673828\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123673828<\/a><br><br>You dream of the beautiful face you have found in this place.

You open your eyes to darkness, it takes a split second for your vision to readjust. You feel lonely and cold. Another shriek knocks you back into reality. Anne sitting next to you, clutching her belly, face contorted from pain. A foul smelling fluid lies pooled on the floor around her mid-section. Your hot dirty fuckfest has brought on labor. she cries your name, begging for help, begging for you. The noise. She\u2019s louder than a line of Louisiana Tigers giving the Rebel Yell right now. You raise your finger to your lips to tell her to be quiet. But the agony is too much for her to bear. You\u2019ve got to do something or else it will awaken the entire neighborhood and with it, the Nazis. Suddenly you remember the bulge in your pants. You\u2019ve got morning wood. It\u2019s not the best gag, but it will have to do. You stand up, squat like a slav, using her belly as an impromptu stool, grab your still cum-crusted cock, and shove it right inside her mouth. At first, she tries to scream even louder in surprise, but your circumcised 100% Kosher dong blocks her windpipe, reducing her screams to a barely audible gurgle. Suffering from unbearable pain, she bites down on her your meat with each contraction. Now you\u2019e in pain too. With each contraction, she bites down harder, it feels like she\u2019s gonna tear your cock right off. Eventually, the pain subsides for her and she doesn\u2019t bite down as much. Now it seems almost as if she\u2019s starting to enjoy it. You can feel your child kick on your testicles. Clearly it\u2019s excited too. Suddenly, your cock starts to shake like a V-2 again, you pull it out of her mouth just in time. You bust your steaming hot and sticky load, blanketing her like an incendiary carpetbombing of Dresden. Semen stains her mountaintops (all three of them), along with her hair and most of her face. She quietly giggles from the ironic amusement of it all. You giggle too","filename":":mu: in a nutshell","ext":".png","w":812,"h":727,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":111,"tim":1493673224396,"time":1493673224,"md5":"c55hDzwjjDf51oE9KW8ZDw==","fsize":652445,"resto":123672086,"id":"auc6t4Kh","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123674088,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)17:14:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123674005\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123674005<\/a><br>Then a look of sharp pain shoot across her face. She\u2019s having your baby. You wish you could bear all the pain for her, but all you can do is sit and watch. You look down at her vulva, still oozing with cum from that great fucking you gave her a few hours ago. You can see a head of black hair poking out. You fear that she\u2019s gonna start screaming again, much to your relief, it seems that she\u2019s gotten better control of the pain, thanks to you. She begins to softly moan, it seems as if instead of experiencing excruciating agony, she\u2019s experiencing an orgasm. You can\u2019t help but grin as she keeps pushing. As more of the head becomes visible, her moaning intensifies. Finally a small head emerges from her vagina. You can see a face wrapped in an umbilical cord. A small pair of hands grab the head, she weakly tries to pull the head out. You put your hands around the head and begin to help her pull. Desperately, she goes into the next contraction with all of her energy, and pushed with everything inside of her. She feels everything. She feels shoulders and hips and feet all slide down inside of her and pop out in one long push, with a rush of fluid behind it, and it feels amazing. She throws her head back with a rip-roaring orgasm that penetrates the very heart of her soul.","filename":"Anne Frank-lifdrs_001","ext":".jpg","w":511,"h":850,"tn_w":75,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493673258963,"time":1493673258,"md5":"K1+wKyRiZz3PxJ1dTKkkVA==","fsize":519724,"resto":123672086,"id":"auc6t4Kh","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123674143,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)17:14:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123674088\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123674088<\/a><br>You look at the newborn now lying on the floor and see that it is a boy.

The baby quickly finds the breast is soon sucking happily. Semen, blood, amniotic fluid, breastmilk all mix and fill the air with a strange scent that while repulsive, is also extremely arousing. You can\u2019t resist the urge anymore. Your mouth land on top of Anne\u2019s opposite breast, sucking first your own cum, but then her tasty milk. You look into her eyes, she\u2019s somewhat annoyed, but too exhaust to really care. A gust of wind coming from a hole in the wall blows through, cooling both of your sweat-drenched bodies, but also disturbing the little one. You\u2019re afraid he\u2019ll start shivering. You look around the dusty attic for something to keep the baby warm. You settle on Anne\u2019s fur winter jacket, having sat unused for the past two years. You know Anne will definitely not be happy that you ruined her favorite coat, but it\u2019s for the best. She hasn\u2019t been able to fit in it for the past nine months anyway. You carefully wrap your little one in the coat and hand him to an exhausted Anne, she continues to quietly feed him. You notice the dead silence for the first time, not even the other occupants of the Annex, mere feet away in the next room, were roused. You feel a sense of relief. You\u2019re safe, for the moment at least. Eventually you curl up next to her quietly and begin to doze off. Your secret sleeps in winter clothes. Tomorrow, you can find a way to explain the night\u2019s events to your parents and hope they don\u2019t kill each other. You can somehow find a way to get your little bundle of joy to safety. But tonight, you just rest, your first night as a family.","filename":"6,000,000 out 10 would bang","ext":".jpg","w":405,"h":477,"tn_w":106,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493673287175,"time":1493673287,"md5":"8zkSDkHQjaXqAuPOTRaStg==","fsize":43348,"resto":123672086,"id":"auc6t4Kh","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":123664497,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)16:03:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"Daily reminder that \/pol\/ is strictly a christian board.

Of course, atrocities and treason have multiplied enormously during the past fifty years, but all that we now have is a vastly greater quantity of the kind of information that was available and should have been conclusive in 1920. The tactics that failed then and failed every year since then are the tactics that are being used today. The most desperate exertions of devoted men and women (some of whom, like the eloquent leader of the 1930\u2019s, Major Pease, and his wife, spent their whole fortunes in the effort and died in poverty) never succeeded in halting even for a moment the enemy\u2019s relentless advance. They did retard that advance, so that now in 1969 we are at the point at which we would otherwise have been in 1945 or 1950. But that point is the end of the road. The net result is total failure.<br><br>It would take several volumes to analyze that failure. It will suffice to note that, first, in war and in politics defensive tactics always fail against a determined and persistent enemy. (If you think there are exceptions, think them over.)

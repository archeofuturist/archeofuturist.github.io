In particular, \/pol\/, the &quot;Politically Incorrect&quot; board, has been a central figure in the outlandish 2016 US election season, as it has often been linked to the alt-right movement and its rhetoric of hate and racism. However, 4chan remains relatively unstudied by the scientific community: little is known about its user base, the content it generates, and how it affects other parts of the Web. In this paper, we start addressing this gap by analyzing \/pol\/ along several axes, using a dataset of over 8M posts we collected over two and a half months. First, we perform a general characterization, showing that \/pol\/ users are well distributed around the world and that 4chan&#039;s unique features encourage fresh discussions. We also analyze content, finding, for instance, that YouTube links and hate speech are predominant on \/pol\/. Overall, our analysis not only provides the first measurement study of \/pol\/, but also insight into online harassment and hate speech trends in social media.<\/span><br><br>https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1610.03452<br>https:\/\/arxiv.org\/pdf\/1610.03452.pd<wbr>f","filename":"11906233_1661938980737600_1330127617_n","ext":".jpg","w":480,"h":480,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490771465969,"time":1490771465,"md5":"OEuOpn+b3Pn08jwliM9QbQ==","fsize":37964,"resto":0,"id":"udLRojoq","country":"EE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"daily-reminder-that-there-is-a-uni-research-paper","country_name":"Estonia","replies":126,"images":35,"omitted_posts":121,"omitted_images":33,"tail_size":50},{"no":118775188,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)07:20:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118764634\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118764634<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Gotta get our hate speech up niggers!<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;niggers<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;niggers<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;faggots<\/span><br><br>Should be hovering around 50% of posts faggots","time":1490786449,"resto":118759493,"id":"unq785qB","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118775350,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)07:23:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118773295\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118773295<\/a><br>how are you going to name it?

My biggest mistake, if I could recall them all, was that I didn&#039;t have the balls to put myself out there to women. I hid my true desires behind irony, sarcasm, and the bizarre notion that I was somehow morally superior to others.<br><br>I want you to be better than me, and have a better life than I did. I want you to keep your beliefs in heart, but not express them to others. I want you to meet women and ..... if that woman likes you and treats you well.... who cares if she is Black\/Asian\/Liberal. Only a very small percentage of men get to have exactly the woman they desire in life. It is O-fucking-KAY to love someone that does not fit into a Hitler wet-dream. <br><br>I want my time back... I would trade in a decade of being based and red-pilled to just have a loving female by my side that thinks I am better than I really am.<br><br>This is a path to loneliness, despair, and bitterness.

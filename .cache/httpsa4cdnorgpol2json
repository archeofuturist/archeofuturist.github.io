I don&#039;t think there are any easy answers, but my frustration was less inpatient and more outpatient. I have a friend who was on over 400mL of diladuid IV per day which is apparently over the LD50 for his weight. No doctor at UCSF wanted to take him as a patient mostly because of having to write for the high doses. This was back in 2004 or so, he is now on like 100mg of Oxy over the course of 24 hours, it&#039;s kind of a miracle. So many doctors said he would not survive his hemoglobin was around 6 and his albumin was so low his muscles were all saturated with water. Basically he was at death&#039;s door. He is much better overall now, but none of the crohns meds work for him so they have him on IVIG which not only costs over 1 million per year (it&#039;s a fairly high dose when used for autoimmune disorders) but has all sorts of side effects including aseptic meningitis. Long story short Crohn&#039;s costs the USA probably 40-60 billion a year and most of it comes from those who are very very sick. Oh and my friend who was on the basically lethal doses of hydromorphone? Would the doctors at UCSF accept him as a patient in 2017? I mean they have to, but would they just let him die to avoid having to report that increase in their DEA license reporting.","time":1492729027,"resto":122005218,"id":"ZLI9Huu+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122058982,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)18:59:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122018682\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122018682<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;This is a severe health crisis, and death rates are doubling and tripling in some places.<\/span><br><br>The reason is not because there are &quot;more addicts&quot; persay... the reason is because the current &quot;trend&quot; among mafia\/trafficking orgs on the Gang\/Street level is because, they are cutting their already shitty, cut Heroin with Fentanyl and shitty Chinese RCs (Research Chemicals) like Apomorphone and a billion Fentanyl analogs.

Who is an accomplished lawyer. And the investigation has nothing to do with &quot;Hacking&quot; the election and the OP didnt even have that in his question so I do not know why you quoted it. They are investigating if there was any collusion between russia and the Trump campaign (not even necessarily trump himself. It is true that as the public we are not privy to any evidence that may or may not have been found yet. But it is clear Putin wanted Trump to win, and there is enough circumstantial evidence to warrant an investigation, not to condemn Trump or his campaign but we should let the investigation continue and to those who dont think there is anything there they should embrace it as it will prove such.<br><br>2.I agree with this haha you are mixing up your demographics OP<br><br>3. This is a complete factual inaccuracy. You are either saying that Romney paid an amount 20% more than Sanders. Which alone would be insane considering Sanders takes in a congressional salary of about 160,000, where as Romney took in a 2007 income of 45 million. If he only paid 20% more than that is unbelievable. Or you mean his income was taxed 20% more, which is also the opposite of true, Romney basically bragged he only paid 13% (the same way Trump does in a way) because he believed as a business man his duty was to make the most money and it demonstrated his knowledge of the system.<br><br>4.

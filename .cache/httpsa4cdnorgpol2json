Distributism, therefore, advocates a society marked by widespread property ownership.[13] Co-operative economist Race Mathews argues that such a system is key to bringing about a just social order.[14]<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Distributism has often been described in opposition to both socialism and capitalism,[15][16] which distributists see as equally flawed and exploitive.[17] Thomas Storck argues: &quot;both socialism and capitalism are products of the European Enlightenment and are thus modernizing and anti-traditional forces. Further, some distributists argue that socialism is the logical conclusion of capitalism as capitalism&#039;s concentrated powers eventually capture the state, resulting in a form of socialism.[18][19] In contrast, distributism seeks to subordinate economic activity to human life as a whole, to our spiritual life, our intellectual life, our family life&quot;.[20]<\/span><br><br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Distr<wbr>ibutism","filename":"pic_giant_082314_Hilaire-Belloc_920","ext":".jpg","w":920,"h":537,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":72,"tim":1491666276901,"time":1491666276,"md5":"yvCuvvYdi9ua4RHWJwzNgQ==","fsize":51332,"resto":120130424,"id":"oqcnIZrv","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"}]},{"posts":[{"no":120139596,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)10:52:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"So \/pol\/,<br><br>Lately I have been thinking that I would rather be living in a Muslim caliphate rather than this abysmal, nihlist shithole we call Western society.

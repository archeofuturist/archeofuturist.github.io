These men and women play an important community role closely connected with our nation&#039;s defense. If a military draft becomes necessary, approximately 2,000 local boards throughout the United States, territories, and the District of Columbia would decide who among the registrants in their community will receive deferments, postponements, or exemption from military service based on the individual registrant&#039;s circumstances and beliefs.&quot;<br><br>Today this post was made by another user:<br><br>&quot;I have been volunteering as a board member of the SSS for over ten years. All correspondence up until today has been with the State Director and\/or the RFO (Reserve Force Officer). The military handles the administration of the Selective Service System UNTIL it becomes activated. At that point, a civilian administrator takes charge.<br><br>Today, I received an email from the Operations Manager of the Selective Service System for our region asking to confirm contact information.

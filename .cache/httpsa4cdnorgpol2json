Well the only place funding outside of a closed economy can come from is net positive trade from external economies.<\/span><br>You&#039;re right debt being created by central banks and &#039;loaned&#039; to Governments (via Treasury Depts). However, the money doesn&#039;t &#039;come from&#039; anywhere. It&#039;s simply an electronic book keeping entry. That goes for National Debt as well as Private debt (car loans, mortgages, etc). <br><br>In the UK for example, although this is a similar ratio in other countries, 97% of &#039;money&#039; is electronic money created as debt - out of thin air. 3% Cash and Coins. Money is not &#039;backed&#039; by anything since gold backed money ended the &#039;gold standard&#039;. FIAT money system is what we&#039;ve got.<br><br>There are two main types of debt... National Debt and Private Debt. Private Debt is an even bigger problem than National debt. The whole banking and monetary system is a giant scam when you think about it. (((they))) benefit by creating money out of nothing while we, in the productive economy, work most of our lives to pay them interest. Debt slavery. <br><br>Worth mentioning Quantitative Easing (QE) too. This is Central Bank created money used, so far, to bail out &#039;too big to fail&#039; private banks - no debt involved. Incredible when you think about this also... Private banksters run dodgy Ponzi schemes that lead to boom bust cycles. In the boom times, (((they))) get richer. In the bust times, which they create, they get bailed out and this makes them richer too. Of course, they should be jailed but they are enriched instead. The effect of increased debt and QE is to debase the currency. For example, a Dollar can literally only buy a few Cents worth compared to 50 years ago or whatever. Who suffers from a debased currency? We do, not the banksters.","time":1490863369,"resto":118892499,"id":"VJBFdp+s","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118902807,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)04:43:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118902700\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118902700<\/a><br><br>I think its important also to acknowledge that muslims and christians don&#039;t lend money at interest historically but jews do, and usury is essentially economic theft as it profits off the value creation of others. hirsotically I believe this to be one of the sole reasons that the Jewish people are financially so powerful.

What we call &#039;reality&#039; is holographic in nature and is made of vibrational information fields. The base state of everything in &#039;reality&#039; is ENERGETIC WAVE-FORM INFORMATION. EVERYTHING! The energetic wave-form information level of &#039;reality&#039; is THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL LEVEL of &#039;reality&#039;. Spoken words are vibrational information fields generated by vocal cords and you hear them when they are decoded by your brain. You consciously hear what they say as long as they are loud enough. Symbols are the same in every respect except that we don&#039;t hear them. They are energetic information fields just like words, but they enter the brain through the sight processes SUBLIMINALLY without us even consciously noticing them (most of the time, that is). This is why symbols are so powerful in infiltrating and manipulating &#039;reality&#039;. They are gateways to the psyche. Chinese philosopher Confucius said: &quot;Signs and symbols rule the world, not words nor laws.&quot;<br><br>If you can be manipulated to focus on a symbol, that is even better for the Cabal, because the frequency of the symbol&#039;s energetic information field reflects the frequency of whatever it is symbolising. Focus on a symbol makes an energetic connection and you connect not only with the symbol, but also with what the symbol represents. Human perception is mostly constructed in the sub-conscious part of the mind - and images\/symbols are the major gateway. From here, perceptions and reactions filter through to the conscious part of the mind as thoughts and emotional responses.","filename":"lights","ext":".png","w":640,"h":279,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":54,"tim":1490863470791,"time":1490863470,"md5":"BGlY3NT\/XaiLgtaxbmmLcQ==","fsize":360783,"resto":118892499,"id":"SDJNa4Gw","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118893978,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)02:35:15","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Somali guy here AMA","com":"As a representitve for the somali people ask me anything about our culture, women, etc.","filename":"sBFoMet","ext":".png","w":931,"h":918,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":246,"tim":1490855715474,"time":1490855715,"md5":"6Lnpsjp4+JUYS\/yd22KAxQ==","fsize":325110,"resto":0,"id":"NNSosDfq","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"somali-guy-here-ama","country_name":"Canada","replies":251,"images":53,"omitted_posts":246,"omitted_images":53,"tail_size":50},{"no":118902172,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)04:32:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"Wuz U Kaaangz n Shiiiiiieeeet?","time":1490862742,"resto":118893978,"id":"T293f7lt","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":118902284,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)04:34:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118895670\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118895670<\/a><br>minneapolis is fucked you retard, fuck off back to detroit lakes with your country ass","time":1490862848,"resto":118893978,"id":"Od9Fv4F8","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118902471,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)04:37:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118893978\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118893978<\/a><br>Clicked on thread just to add Somali flag to my collection.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;leaf<\/span><br><br>lynch yourself nigger","time":1490863037,"resto":118893978,"id":"MSN1OQaJ","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118902496,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)04:37:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118901572\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118901572<\/a><br>100% somalia genes","time":1490863060,"resto":118893978,"id":"miBIMYrE","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":118902882,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)04:44:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118896396\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118896396<\/a><br>Women from or have parents from poor cunts are like that","time":1490863469,"resto":118893978,"id":"CTwBH8kO","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118897118,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)03:17:12","name":"Anonymous","sub":"This bug eyed bitch Farkas, is a globalist","com":"http:\/\/www.politico.com\/story\/2015\/<wbr>11\/evelyn-farkas-russia-pentagon-21<wbr>5517<br>(((Farkas))) was calling for the arming of the Ukraine, in their regional conflict with Russia.

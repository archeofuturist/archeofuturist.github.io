The numbers:<br><br>Le Pen - 25%<br>Melenchon - 21.7%<br>Macron - 21.0%<br>Fillon - 20.2%<br>Hamon - 5.2%<br><br>Shut up an trust me on that. I will be right. Le Pen historically always overperforms her polls unless there is another credible right wing candidate for her votes to go to. There isn&#039;t. I have used a variety of other methods to calculate the other numbers; to be very brief, always remember that Macron&#039;s base is FRAGILE (1\/3 of voters could change minds) and is attracted to Melenchon&#039;s base, where as Fillon has stalled because of Penelopegate, and there is no reason to vote for Hamon as Melenchon becomes the candidate for the Left. <br><br>2nd Round will be 51.43% for Le Pen and 48.51% for Melenchon. Polls after the first round will show roughly a 54\/46 race, favouring Melenchon. <br><br>The crucial moment will come when Fillon ENDORSES Le Pen (or several prominent members of his party), NOT as a vote for Le Pen but AGAINST MELENCHON. Why would he\/they do that, you ask? Because they support Le Pen AGAINST the commie Melenchon (he wants 100% tax on rich). ALSO, they will have a parliamentary majority, and want to get shit done. THEY CAN GET SHIT DONE WITH LE PEN, BUT NOT WITH MELENCHON. This is crucial to remember.<br><br>This will be the FINAL BLOW. Currently (((polls))) predict the abstention rates of Fillon supporters in a 2nd round Le Pen\/Melenchon to be approximately 50%. (i.e. 50% do not vote at all). Fillon\/his party&#039;s endorsement of Le Pen will reduce this rate to approximately 30%, which results in the 51.43% victory I described above. So, add all these factors in and Le Pen will Make France Great Again. I&#039;m waiting, \/pol\/.

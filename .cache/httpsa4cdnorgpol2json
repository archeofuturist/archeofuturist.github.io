Multiple strange coincidences occurred during these events. It was a pretty spooky affair.

Some people said that the key, or parts of the key to some wikileaks insurance files were indeed found but stopped cold. <br><br>Whenever this topic is brought up, it is usually heavily attacked. Attacked to a point that is a little strange. On some boards, discussions of this topic are flat out deleted or stifled one way or another.<br><br>https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/conspiracy<wbr>\/comments\/64m8hp\/summary_of_how_wik<wbr>ileaks_and_assange_were\/<br><br>http:\/\/archive.is\/Pj6Sl<br><br><br>The first link is a summary and timeline of this investigation which really helps to get an idea of the weirdness to this whole event.

Any good links for further info? Supposedly investigations are still happening underground and as far away as possible from government scrutiny as possible.

A big part of this has been a widespread crackdown on open defecation, popularized by NGOs and the World Health Organization over the years. Suddenly, poop became very political in India, with millions of rupees allocated to building toilets across the country.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;But a few days ago, Dipali Rastogi, an Indian official who was focused on tribal issues, took to the pages of a national newspaper to push back. In an op-ed called &#039;Some Washroom Wisdom&#039; she wagged her finger at the way the government and the inexhaustible list of nonprofits in India have shit on some habits in the name of progress and adhering to Western standards. Rastogi points out that forcing Indians to build or use toilets without addressing water scarcity is ignorant. &quot;Now, however, the goras [white people] are saying it&#039;s unhygienic to leave your excreta out in the fields. That it causes underground water pollution. That it causes diarrhoea, even malnutrition. We must build a toilet within the house,&quot; she writes.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Rastogi points out there isn&#039;t enough water to sustain or flush these toilets in a lot of Indian villages\u2014around 774 million people have inadequate access to clean water. Building toilets, then, just becomes a bandaid on a much larger wound, and forcing people to use them without proper infrastructure becomes discriminatory, especially against rural Indians who have coexisted peacefully with fields and forests for generations. &quot;During the routine summer village visits,&quot; Rastogi writes, &quot;the toilet was the khet, the fields. One carried a tumbler of water [to wash]. Somehow it felt good, the wide open spaces, the twilight, and the feeling of having left the stuff far away from your house. Covered in mud or sometimes just left to dry. <\/span><br><br>(1\/2)<br><br>https:\/\/archive.fo\/RaJDF","filename":"1442926913650-10","ext":".jpg","w":400,"h":332,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":207,"tim":1492788054387,"time":1492788054,"md5":"9o+R5+uTn3eATJfqIDSFrA==","fsize":31228,"resto":0,"id":"luWp\/j6C","country":"NL","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"poo-in-loo","country_name":"Netherlands","replies":129,"images":14,"omitted_posts":124,"omitted_images":13,"tail_size":50},{"no":122162899,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)13:58:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122158446\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122158446<\/a><br> <br>Which is more pleasant and associated with good things?

The search warrant was issued by a Clerk Magistrate of the Quincy District Court after police received a credible report that the occupant of 50 Doane Street had numerous unsecured rifles and shotguns strewn about his house. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The occupant of the home is a 65-year old male who lives alone. Detectives are still interviewing him and no charges have been filed at this point. The man does have a license to possess riffles and shotguns, which was revoked by the Cohasset Police Chief today. All of his weapons have been seized. This case remains under investigation by the Cohasset Police.<\/span><br><br>https:\/\/cuckbook\/permalink.php?stor<wbr>y_fbid=1466219473420307&amp;id=17214072<wbr>6161528","filename":"17884376_1466219300086991_1612091016624022835_n","ext":".jpg","w":960,"h":772,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":201,"tim":1492552610556,"time":1492552610,"md5":"w53kI+MIQ\/c7ATgfxjqHHg==","fsize":203620,"resto":0,"id":"KcTXRrn+","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"gun-confiscation-in-massachusetts","country_name":"United States","replies":274,"images":61,"omitted_posts":269,"omitted_images":59,"tail_size":50},{"no":121767216,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)20:13:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121762057\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121762057<\/a><br>if that&#039;s an arm brace that thing is in an illegal configuration you doublenigger<br><br>delet this","filename":"1490362771778","ext":".jpg","w":534,"h":819,"tn_w":81,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492560839566,"time":1492560839,"md5":"2CnITKuyuz94ZJrIXjHgew==","fsize":114115,"resto":121747365,"id":"xGVKgLsR","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121767249,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)20:14:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121766910\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121766910<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;spelling your whiskey without an &#039;e&#039;<\/span><br>Absolutely disgusting.","time":1492560853,"resto":121747365,"id":"FHGxWTKH","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121767261,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)20:14:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121767101\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121767101<\/a><br><br>True, mortars make them asspained.","time":1492560856,"resto":121747365,"id":"dPHiAMJw","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121767350,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)20:14:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;had numerous unsecured rifles and shotguns <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;<a href=\"#p121766876\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121766876<\/a><\/span><br>so what are you going do fag","filename":"(2) Some of Ian&#039;s Gun Collection, on a Matrix Armory Display Wall - YouTube [720p].mp4_snapshot_20.15_[2017.04.18_19.14.20]","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":720,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1492560884127,"time":1492560884,"md5":"4WipZG2kJFQ5tplvqDp8sw==","fsize":150650,"resto":121747365,"id":"XvVWlcGW","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":121767367,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)20:14:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121767102\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121767102<\/a><br>Don&#039;t confuse him with easily confirmed facts.","time":1492560891,"resto":121747365,"id":"oISRrs2X","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":121734181,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)16:22:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"Literally what was Canada&#039;s role in WW2?<br><br>To provide oral relief for the real soldiers who did all the heavy lifting?","filename":"flag of canada","ext":".png","w":964,"h":665,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":172,"tim":1492546950817,"time":1492546950,"md5":"hGdkEu55MLu5JZ3QATtK+g==","fsize":14390,"resto":0,"id":"RyPWIJTT","country":"DE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"literally-what-was-canadas-role-in-ww2","country_name":"Germany","replies":292,"images":63,"omitted_posts":287,"omitted_images":60,"tail_size":50},{"no":121765784,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)20:03:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121764266\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121764266<\/a><br>kek","filename":"sweden","ext":".png","w":800,"h":694,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":108,"tim":1492560233213,"time":1492560233,"md5":"M0jBFwZ70YjlwJwMwfW0+A==","fsize":1135315,"resto":121734181,"id":"8QLJznFr","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121765914,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)20:04:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121764445\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121764445<\/a><br>I bet you&#039;re a Trudeau fan. https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=oYB<wbr>u_IxX4XE","time":1492560293,"resto":121734181,"id":"l\/pgVQ+X","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121766299,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)20:07:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121749245\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121749245<\/a><br>Wish this was still your flag.

The concept of an &quot;illegal opinion&quot; itself is, and ought to be, alien to me.

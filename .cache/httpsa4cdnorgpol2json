Everybody here thinks they&#039;re fucking historians or some shit.<br><br>First of all, lets talk about the Macedonians between 800BC and 570AD. For starters, nobody is sure which peoples made up the Macedonians. It could be Dacians, Celts, Epirots, or whoever the fuck else. It could be a mix of all of them. This shit happened 2500 years ago who the hell knows for sure? What is known, however, is that Athenians, Spartans, and Achaeans refereed to Macedonians as &#039;barbarians&#039; because they did move south from the mountains on the modern greek-macedonian border into their territory.<br><br>But since 570AD, the original population of the entire balkans, not just present-day Macedonia, has been largley replaced by slavs and other migrants during the middle ages. Yes this includes greeks too. Dont give me the &#039;100% pure greek blood&#039; bullshit. Ive seen greeks that look more turk than greek. <br><br>All the modern Macedonians that claim to be direct descendent from Alexander are so cringe-worthy it physically pains me. If you go to Macedonia and look at the people, some are obviously slav, some are probably albanian (in skopje 50% chance), some look like roaches, while some look like you would expect ancient greeks and macedonians to look like. And its the same everywhere in the balkans. <br><br>The whole &#039;Macedonia is a meme country&#039; stems from all the surrounding countries claiming ownership of part or all of FYROM because at one point in history, it was part of their empires. Greece is salty because of the name, which part of me understands. Bulgaria thinks its their rightful clay because Tsar Samuil incorporated Macedonia into the Bulgarian Empire during the 10th century. Albania thinks it belongs to them because WE WUZ ILLYRIANS and the entire balkans are rightfully theirs. And the Serbs, they think its theirs because it was part of the Serbian empire between 1346 and 1371.

I understand you are shelled and thrown rocks at all the time by the muslims, but in all honesty you chose that area yourself because of your beliefs of thousands of years ago. Stop making the US topple dictators as it makes matters far worse in those countries. I understand you want to expand, but you already have land as well as being the most prevalent in the US. All you are causing is more misery in already miserable countries, as well as trying to subdue white people because white people are dumb and let you. I understand that you want to be on top, everyone does at all times by any means necessary but you are fighting against everyone. I have no hate towards you, and I acknowledge that you are smart and know your way around politics and major issues thus deserve to be on top, but the wars really need to stop. I don&#039;t blame them all on you, but most. All the things you have made in the media and cucking the white man has been funny and working to your advantage, but I can&#039;t enjoy TV or my life for that matter, because everything is shilling me to be degenerate and feel bad about myself if I don&#039;t follow the mainstream. I have become a friendless recluse since my realization, and life would be far simpler if you stopped polluting everyones minds. Yes - it&#039;s their fault for believing in it, but why not do something good for everyone instead of just for your own kind? You are splitting apart nations and driving people against each other so that you can come out on top, but you already have so much. <br><br>Will you not stop until everyone is below you as goym\/slaves?

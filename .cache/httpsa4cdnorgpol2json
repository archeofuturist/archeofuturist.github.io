Daily reminder that sea levels around the world were about 400 feet lower just before the end of the last Ice Age.<br><br>Near the end of the last Ice Age about 12,800 years ago, a giant comet that had entered the Solar System from deep space thousands of years earlier, broke into multiple fragments. Some of these fragments struck Earth, causing a global cataclysm unseen since the extinction of the dinosaurs. At least eight of the fragments hit the North American ice cap, while further fragments hit the Northern European ice cap. The impacts, from comet fragments a mile wide approaching at more than 60,000 miles an hour, generated huge amounts of heat which instantly liquidised millions of square kilometres of ice, destabilising Earth&#039;s crust and causing the global flood that is remembered in myths all around the world.<br><br>A second series of impacts, equally devastasting, causing further cataclysmic flooding, occurred about 11,600 years ago, the exact date that Plato gives for the destruction and submergence of Atlantis. The evidence for all of this shows beyond reasonable doubt that a civilisation at least as technologically advanced as 19th-century England at the onset of the Industrial Revolution (if not more technologically advanced) that flourished during the last Ice Age was destroyed in the global cataclysms between about 12,800 years ago and about 11,600 years ago.<br><br>A distant memory and a warning to the future - for the comet that wrought such destruction in remote antiquity may not be done with us yet.","filename":"iceagemap","ext":".png","w":853,"h":440,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":128,"tim":1493127842998,"time":1493127842,"md5":"cs0+u5uti9vK6vqtSQSaoQ==","fsize":557051,"resto":0,"id":"MT5xsBCS","country":"AU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-red-parts-of-this-map-used-to-be-land-daily","country_name":"Australia","replies":239,"images":45,"omitted_posts":234,"omitted_images":43,"tail_size":50},{"no":122760762,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)13:41:55","name":"mexican intellectual","com":"<a href=\"#p122760328\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122760328<\/a><br>what do you mean by sea peoples, who do you suspect they were? <br><br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sea_P<wbr>eoples <br><br>i dont want to fully believe wikipedia","time":1493142115,"resto":122734952,"id":"czs0n1S2","country":"MX","country_name":"Mexico"},{"no":122760904,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)13:43:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122759980\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122759980<\/a><br>That&#039;s what a lot of people still think, a lot of research has been done close to spain the last few years. still nothing useful turned up I think, really starting to think it either never existed or people are looking at the wrong places<br><br><a href=\"#p122760679\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122760679<\/a><br>sounds interesting","time":1493142186,"resto":122734952,"id":"SITN+SGW","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":122761015,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)13:44:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122760512\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122760512<\/a><br><br>fellow far inland master race reporting in","time":1493142244,"resto":122734952,"id":"svbDeWIs","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122761024,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)13:44:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122734952\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122734952<\/a><br><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;As advanced as 19th century England<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;No survivors to carry the torch or any trace of their epic civilizations <\/span><br><br>lel","time":1493142246,"resto":122734952,"id":"G7AxNh1A","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122761087,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)13:44:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122760609\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122760609<\/a><br>The egyptian kings list goes back quite far too, at least 35,000+ years from the time of the first empire and their earliest Pharaohs ruled for centuries or thousands of years and the very first were actually Gods, Horus\/Isis\/Set\/Osiris who lived among the people, likely the original rulers who became deified.","time":1493142277,"resto":122734952,"id":"BqCvKoNG","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":122753631,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)12:42:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"How do we fix the Europe problem?","filename":"Screenshot_20170424-204418","ext":".jpg","w":1052,"h":1154,"tn_w":227,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493138551127,"time":1493138551,"md5":"A9ltxtYBqhGelUQUrY3IjQ==","fsize":365292,"resto":0,"id":"yGkVGG0Q","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"how-do-we-fix-the-europe-problem","country_name":"United States","replies":25,"images":4,"omitted_posts":20,"omitted_images":4},{"no":122760620,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)13:40:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122757661\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122757661<\/a><br>BAN ASSAULT UMBRELLSA!<br><br>COMMON SENSE UMBRELLA LAWS NOW!<br><br>WON&#039;T SOMEONE THINK OF THE CHILDREN!?!?<br>MUSOGGYNEEEE!!!!!","filename":"REEEEEEEEEEEE","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":720,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1493142037895,"time":1493142037,"md5":"K0z0SK8aQ0bY+z\/QpqQXjQ==","fsize":111485,"resto":122753631,"id":"zo+nqHxl","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":122760914,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)13:43:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"soflafag here<br>not suprising<br>natural selection at work.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;....and here come the lawsuits<\/span>","time":1493142191,"resto":122753631,"id":"9+UmV\/my","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122760926,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)13:43:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122759479\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122759479<\/a><br>yea i tried this shit as a kid from first floor. didnt work, fucking hurt.

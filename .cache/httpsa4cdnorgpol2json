Before this, our only asian communities were small amounts of Chinese, Japanese, and Filipinos. They were not allowed to be over 2% of the population. <br><br>This changed in 1965 though, and the people who pushed this immigration act lied to us, saying that our ethnic mix would not be disturbed and that the thought of whites becoming a minority was just a conspiracy theory. <br><br>Secondly, asians are not part of the American identity. The United States was founded to be a Western country, with European roots. That&#039;s why our immigration policy was ALWAYS based around Europe.<br><br>Asian Americans have no identity. They don&#039;t feel American, they don&#039;t feel part of the &quot;greater society&quot; and have no feelings to improve it. <br><br>If a German and Chinese immigrant came over to the United States at the same time and were raised around a similar community, the children of both would be radically different. The child of the German would be naturally conservative and wanting to preserve society, the child of the Chinaman would want to destroy it (pic related). <br><br>Identity is very important for the stability of the country. All they offer to the United States is money. If the US is to degenerate into a shallow materialistic shell of a society, then asians are the perfect poison for it. <br><br>If you have any more questions I&#039;ll answer them, but remember white man: just because Asians happen to be slightly more intelligent and rich than Mestizos and Africans does not mean they&#039;re good people or good for the United States.<br><br>They are not and will never be American.","filename":"7977369_448x252","ext":".jpg","w":448,"h":252,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1490289510320,"time":1490289510,"md5":"HXpLDOToHUQUEfTkb+PXMw==","fsize":12352,"resto":0,"id":"XOFO2kR+","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"asian-hate-thread","country_name":"United States","replies":233,"images":117,"omitted_posts":228,"omitted_images":113,"tail_size":50},{"no":117967821,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)14:59:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117955216\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117955216<\/a><br><br>I have yet to have met a shitty oriental, many have been meh, some have been bro-tier.

It doesn&#039;t even recognize that there is such a thing as common resources. Georgism corrects this flaw by not only recognizing common resources like land, minerals, water, fish stocks as such, but adds that by managing these resources with user fees, you can get rid of all other taxation and remove impediments to economic development. So under Georgism, regular folk are mostly taxed in proportion to the value of any land they may possess. The vast majority of people would pay a lot less than they currently pay in income, payroll and consumption taxes, but absentee landlords would pay a lot more, and the mortgage business of banks would be an order of magnitude smaller, because land taxes cancel the benefits of homeownership as an investment. The system also discourages the inefficient use of land, controlling sprawl and inefficient farming practices. Housing and transportation costs would be greatly reduced, thus allowing for a greater equality of opportunity. A Universal basic income (UBI) could provide for those unable to work.","time":1493829190,"resto":123898825,"id":"Z8VmXcoK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123930376,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)12:35:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123929760\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123929760<\/a><br>You emotional anime-trap loving cucks are what makes libertarianism fail.","time":1493829315,"resto":123898825,"id":"A+DliFod","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123930861,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)12:40:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123930376\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123930376<\/a><br>Then why did anime help the alt-right become mainstream so much?","filename":"1491694016092","ext":".png","w":750,"h":1020,"tn_w":91,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493829605579,"time":1493829605,"md5":"R7cX3VPnWCNuUZcozm\/Cgg==","fsize":470908,"resto":123898825,"id":"6iDZFYAI","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123930998,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)12:41:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123930861\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123930861<\/a><br>It didn&#039;t.","time":1493829698,"resto":123898825,"id":"A+DliFod","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123931300,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)12:44:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123930998\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123930998<\/a><br>Anime and memes certainly made the alt right huge.<br><br>You&#039;d have to be an absolute retard to disagree with this.<br><br>Why do you want libertarianism to be boring so nobody will be interested?","time":1493829876,"resto":123898825,"id":"6iDZFYAI","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]},{"posts":[{"no":123925826,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)11:53:01","name":"Anonymous","sub":"\/ptg\/ PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP THREAD","com":"PRESIDENT DONALD J TRUMP<br>https:\/\/www.whitehouse.gov<br>https:\/\/www.donaldjtrump.com\/<br>DAILY SCHEDULE (WH Press Corps)<br>https:\/\/publicpool.kinja.com\/<br>Trump Playlist<br>http:\/\/pastebin.com\/X9qQJVKJ<br><br>APPEARANCES<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Pres Trump on Face The Nation 4\/30\/17<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/t55wTLHwGZE [Open]<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Pres Trump - First 100 Days<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/hBw_RhnCDZ8 [Open]<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Pres Trump Weekly Address #14 4\/28\/17<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/u7oOmkXYznU [Open]<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Pres Trump Rally @ Harrisburg, PA 4\/29\/17<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/y9viYq9Z3U4 [Open]<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;VP Pence @ USS Indiana Christening 4\/29\/17<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/-jtmzlLz_2M [Open]<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Pres Trump signs EO establishing Office of Trade and Mfg 4\/29\/17<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/28Blqw7_-lQ [Open]<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Pres Trump interview w\/Martha Maccallum 4\/28\/17<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/8NqMJq6nR_8 [Open]<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;FLotUS Melania visits sick kids @ Bunny Melon Healen Garden 4\/28\/17<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/s6mOS3mZK9E [Open]<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Pres Trump @ NRA 4\/28\/17<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/0jD-3jp-HUQ [Open]<br>PREV APPEARANCES<br>http:\/\/pastebin.com\/ynXV6CHT<br>NEWTRUMP NIGHTLY NEWS<br>http:\/\/pastebin.com\/yArfUKdC<br>WH PRESS BRIEFINGS<br>http:\/\/pastebin.com\/QidpHWKJ<br><br>FUN STUFF<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;March in the Trumpenreich<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/gwmp3E9VIX0 [Open]<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;TrumpWave S P A C E<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/s1qhafzPkAM [Open]<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;God Emperor Trump Was Born To Rule<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/pf4RSgb_Pqg [Open]<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Donald Trump Emperor of America<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/xQCaWLF2gfs [Open]<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;TrumpBot vs Mexico<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/Q__bSi5rBlw [Open]<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Shadilay<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/ZNriNoWOtXA [Open]<br><br><br>OP pastebin: http:\/\/pastebin.com\/nygxu29R","filename":"IMG_5177","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":683,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1493826781779,"time":1493826781,"md5":"zXDa74QahQXp+DcHWRmxxQ==","fsize":27755,"resto":0,"id":"K9TIXl80","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"ptg-president-donald-trump-thread","country_name":"United States","replies":66,"images":14,"omitted_posts":61,"omitted_images":13},{"no":123931136,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)12:42:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123930821\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123930821<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;calling plebbit &quot;reddit&quot;<\/span><br><br>Frogposting has always been our thing you filthy normie scum.

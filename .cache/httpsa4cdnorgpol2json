The idea was to build a mental abstraction of what humans are, thus simplifying them, and make up a society based on that and strict logical principles. From this type of constructivism, humans have spawned all kinds of political ideologies based on their naivete, most notably libertarianism, communism and nazism. They all fail because, as I said, they are anthropologically optimist. Instead, any proper political ideology has to be more malleable and less principled, and based on tradition which is the natural selection of political ideas. Those which survive are the ones which are making a society most prosperous and stable.<br><br>These different ideologies use different base assumptions, however. The key ones of libertarians is the idea that information is completely costless and there is no cost to interacting with other people. That&#039;s why they follow so closely Austrian economics and basic microeconomics, as these two disciplines make exactly the same assumptions. This way contracts are completely and people can easily agree voluntarily with one another what each party should do, and what each should expect. There can be genuinely no disagreements here because all parties have full access to all available information. Once you remove these two assumptions, the libertarian world view falls apart, as ownership starts to matter as residual rights (those not predicted in contracts) are accrued to the owner, and it becomes directly related to wielding power. Conflicts also become very hard to solve, because arguments are not enough when people operate on fundamentally different frameworks and genuinely think they are both in the right. If you can&#039;t solve this, your society will be unstable.","time":1492522488,"resto":121652346,"id":"UgZjK3hS","country":"PT","country_name":"Portugal"},{"no":121686053,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)09:44:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121652346\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121652346<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121685089\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121685089<\/a><br>Also, because of its emphasis on &quot;freedom&quot;, i.e. the removal of every external constraint to action and thought, it ends up not realizing that people are what they are through other people. To live in society, however, is to be constrained by other people, whether you like it or not. Everything you do affects other people; everything others do affects you. To remove the part from the whole is to destroy both: to remove oneself from society is to cease to be human. A person is to society like what a cell or a arm is to the whole body. If an arm goes rogue and is not commanded by the brain but behave incontrollably, it is putting at risk the well-being of the whole body. When cells do the same, we usually call it cancer.<br><br>Whether it is some respected elder, the generality of people in society or some abstract government, society will always impose bounds of behavior upon you, expects you abide by them and wants you to contribute to enforcing them. No matter how hard you want to escape this, you never ever will. Your only chance is to shape society to your liking, which is what people focused on this type of &quot;freedom&quot; have historically done. Unfortunately, so much talk about oppression and they are the ones who end up being the worst oppressors. So, you will never be &quot;free&quot; in the sense you want, and this idea of &quot;freedom&quot; becomes irrelevant and unfeasible. Instead, one is only truly free if a society enables and promotes one the means to pursue one&#039;s nature.","time":1492523085,"resto":121652346,"id":"UgZjK3hS","country":"PT","country_name":"Portugal"}]},{"posts":[{"no":121685846,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)09:42:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"Race mixing is wro-","filename":"1492459710736","ext":".jpg","w":545,"h":545,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492522973896,"time":1492522973,"md5":"\/YAjGRZrQoMD4stMy0yqxQ==","fsize":53429,"resto":0,"id":"ENvdlCW2","country":"AU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"race-mixing-is-wro","country_name":"Australia","replies":2,"images":0},{"no":121685914,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)09:43:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"..ng","time":1492523018,"resto":121685846,"id":"qTTQsU9R","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":121686052,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)09:44:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"5\/10 and I&#039;m being generous","time":1492523083,"resto":121685846,"id":"wvf91NSG","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"}]},{"posts":[{"no":121681146,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)08:53:52","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Scotland Thread","com":"Scotland Thread<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;How do you deal with our liberal ass country?<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What way do you vote? <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Are you for or against independence?<\/span>","filename":"scotland","ext":".png","w":1280,"h":768,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":150,"tim":1492520032941,"time":1492520032,"md5":"wUOltQWsaSdfqqQbba0quQ==","fsize":12456,"resto":0,"id":"4ZULtPZo","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"scotland-thread","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":104,"images":18,"omitted_posts":99,"omitted_images":18,"tail_size":50},{"no":121685902,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)09:43:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121685722\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121685722<\/a><br>Gets rid of the massive leech which is England.

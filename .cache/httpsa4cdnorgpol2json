In my experience, this is at least true insofar as they are more tolerable than blacks, spics, and sandniggers. I grew up in a suburb of LA that has the highest demographic of 1st and 2nd generation East Asian americans in the country, went to primary\/secondary school with a ton of Asians, and pursued STEM in college, so I&#039;ve had casual and friendly relationships with asians. I have even dated 2 asian girls and gotten to know their families over the course of the relationships. So my question arises not out of a state of ignorance, but of discomfort with the implications of my own observations. <br><br>Why is it that in my entire life I&#039;ve not met a single Asian who possesses the irreducibly complex inner reality referred to as a human soul? I have not associated with Asians personally since my university days (when I came to this realization) because I can&#039;t find in any of them any of the aspects that I&#039;m looking for in a fruitful adult friendship. Asians don&#039;t seem to cultivate personal identity or knowledge of arts\/philosophy of their own volition, nor do they seem to experience life with the same sense of self-important individualism that embodies the best aspects of western society. I can see that they have somewhat of a drive toward achievment in life, and that they abide by at least some simulacrum of morality, and yet literally NONE of the hundreds of asians that I&#039;ve met in my life have seemed to have that &quot;spark&quot; of personality seems essentially commonplace in white people.<br><br>Why is this so? If Asians have high IQ why do the vast majority of them come off as boring\/intellectually empty\/milquetoast retards?","filename":"1111111111","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":374,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1492154474512,"time":1492154474,"md5":"SSRrocUUH\/lzP0HGdLfxLA==","fsize":42997,"resto":0,"id":"oOIcTHnq","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"are-asians-actually-complete-humans","country_name":"United States","replies":164,"images":38,"omitted_posts":159,"omitted_images":36,"tail_size":50},{"no":121039170,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)04:59:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121039072\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121039072<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;equation having a soul with some external like religion<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;thinking individualism means you don&#039;t care about your family<\/span><br>insect brain detected.","time":1492160342,"resto":121032587,"id":"mutoVYdD","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121039174,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)04:59:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121038925\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121038925<\/a><br>Yeah Neanderthals who hunted all the time were weak and passive.

I am 2% sure that a certain highly profitable business in my area is a front for a possible child trafficking network or sub network. The proof I have is no proof but allegations based on nothing but a hunch and a superstition. Anyone out there that want to help me dig up something that could be useful, maybe we will find out it is not true but at least I can sleep at night. I live in alaska where there is high rate of child trafficking but little to no action by law enforcement.","filename":"download","ext":".jpg","w":309,"h":163,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":131,"tim":1492157491794,"time":1492157491,"md5":"CkqN67+blP4nWf+JUgXvDw==","fsize":6818,"resto":0,"id":"oeoQBGxM","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"calling-the-altright","country_name":"United States","replies":41,"images":5,"omitted_posts":36,"omitted_images":4},{"no":121038547,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)04:49:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121036178\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121036178<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121036527\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121036527<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121037274\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121037274<\/a><br><br>So what&#039;s the plan mama bear?

Iran was ecstatic, knowing that an Islamist government will inevitably come into power now that the military run government had collapsed under the wave of popular revolt. Knowing that Egypt was a long-time US ally, they concluded that the social media attack against the Egyptian government was grass root based. This couldn\u2019t be further from the truth and underestimating US-planning would cost all these states dearly.

The Syrian \u201cday of rage\u201d fizzled out thanks to (then) strong security apparatus that monitored the internet and preempted all security breaches. Libya was a different matter. It almost immediately escalated to an armed conflict where the army had split. The US and France brought a \u201chumanitarian\u201d proposal to the UNSC to enforce a no-fly zone on Libya that Russia and China defacto-accepted. France immediately broke the terms of the resolution to attack the Libyan army on the ground and destroy its infrastructure.

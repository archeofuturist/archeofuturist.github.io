You have to suspend judgment for a very long time to understand it, and even then it only seems like it&#039;s partially true. We&#039;ve seen evolution in recorded history, like dog breeds, for example, so its existence cannot be completely refuted. But what function did birds&#039; wings have before birds were able to fly? If we&#039;re supposed to believe evolution happens through random mutations, it seems awful strange that those random mutations would be so persistent, and so directed, towards a specific goal, such as flight for birds, when many, many generations would have to pass before the wings had any functionality at all. But with that said, it doesn&#039;t mean evolution is junk. It just means that the human race hasn&#039;t fully gotten it&#039;s mind around it yet.","time":1490843683,"resto":118867176,"id":"OFh9Lx7P","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118840367,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)17:59:22","name":"Anonymous","sub":"This is Antifa, ladies and gentlemen.","com":"This is your average manlet that you will find in Antifa.

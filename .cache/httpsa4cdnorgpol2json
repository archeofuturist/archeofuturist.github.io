I think that they actually succeed the more superficially you take them. They are a good example of the &quot;chosen one&quot; archetype in modern drama. Its when you get into the particulars that it turns into SJW crap and the hypocrisy flows out. <br><br>The reason why I said Harry Potter is because in fiction you can take what you will from it. Greek Mythology is loaded with great stories and while those back in the day certainly believed it to be literal, nothing is lost by reading some Homer and taking it as a good story loaded with archetypes. <br><br>This is why even if you are an atheist it behooves you to know Christian imagery and language as it is constantly referenced throughout the rest of our culture. <br><br>Shakespeare was the best at using multiple sources of inspiration. He uses a bizarro world Christianity with subtle references to Jove and very few named references. <br><br>He has no problem with one character praying to Mars and another in Christ.

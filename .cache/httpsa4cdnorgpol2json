Catastrophes start coming, and from the ruins of the statue a snake (Lucifer) starts leaving, as if its job is done. He stretches his hand out and still wants it\/her, and gets turned into stone himself. A spaceship is landing.<br>In the end of the video, two guys are at the antarctic to meet the annunaki (?) where prominent figures and actors, including f.ex. Patriarch Kirill of the Orthodox Church, strangely visited last and current year. There wasnt info about this in the media, but there were some strange happenings of celebrities tweeting pictures of black pyramids and then removing them. Im sure some anons can remember this.<br><br>The similarity is that both songs hint about love before the eclipse, which we should avoid in order to meet in september. Basically, will the ANTICHRIST appear this summer and try to trick us from salvation? With the false song of peace and love?<br><br>Also, the house in the Gorillaz song is literally the spirit cooking house of Marina Abrahamovic (from the Podesta emails, satanism).<br>Look at the music video and see the symbolism involving Saturn with its rings (Satan).

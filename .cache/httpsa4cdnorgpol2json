Intel is pretty good about letting employees move around within the company. An opening came up on the Management Engine team, and since I have experience with micro-controllers I figured I&#039;d give it a shot. The interview went great and they wanted me on board, but the final step was to get a security clearance.<br><br>I asked them WTF I need a security clearance for, and they said they couldn&#039;t tell me until I was on the team. Thus began a 3 year trip down the fucking rabbit hole.<br><br>I&#039;m coming forward today because of the news that Trump was spied on. I know exactly how it was done because I spent the last three years adding backdoors into the ME. For those of you that are unaware, the ME is on a separate CPU and cannot be disabled, and it exists at a level below the operating system. Intel has been working with the intelligence community for years to get backdoors into physical hardware so they don&#039;t have to worry about finding OS exploits. If the hardware itself is compromised then the whole machine is compromised.","filename":"E1jOQL2t","ext":".png","w":512,"h":512,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490242982819,"time":1490242982,"md5":"utzfZvZGzJr9q50mMrdcWQ==","fsize":32796,"resto":0,"id":"Bk\/FHvIo","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"intel-me","trip":"!!6U610hrljE5","country_name":"United States","replies":82,"images":17,"omitted_posts":77,"omitted_images":16},{"no":117890173,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)00:58:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117889846\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117889846<\/a><br>KENNY HEROLD<br>JULIE HEROLD<br>ODINS EYE OWNERS","time":1490245085,"resto":117886401,"id":"racxySBn","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117890268,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)00:58:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117887999\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117887999<\/a><br>There is no such thing as modding that fucker without destroying it.

It&#039;s rapidly losing market share to altcoins as its use as a payment network is being hindered by soaring transaction fees (avg transaction fee is around $0.45 now, up about 50x from a year ago). If it gets enough miner backing to fork off to raise the capacity limits it has a bright future as ahead and further decentralization and thus security of the network will continue to rise. <br><br>It is looking hopeful that (((Blockstream))) will lose their grasp on the development of btc, thwarting their plans to keep on-chain transactions expensive and forcing users to go through their payment hubs so they can profit off of the users themselves while adding an extra unnecessary layer of centralization. <br><br>I feel first the market price must see a fairly heavy correction to force miners in to capitulating and signaling to fork the network to raise the capacity limits. This will be the time to buy in.","time":1492932343,"resto":122391969,"id":"zUm5OpJg","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122395762,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)03:29:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122394467\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122394467<\/a><br>Lets hope they dont drop their smartphones filled with bitcoin into the polluted rivers they like to swim in.","time":1492932545,"resto":122391969,"id":"\/0E0S0kl","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"}]},{"posts":[{"no":122395760,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)03:28:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"\/pol\/ is brigaded by Antifa.<br><br>Post triggering pictures.","filename":"jew_basic","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":600,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492932515531,"time":1492932515,"md5":"QQeM87\/S6vqk8FqzXtnuLA==","fsize":39105,"resto":0,"id":"gTgYKEN6","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"pol-is-brigaded-by-antifa","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":122392478,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)02:47:11","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Antifa","com":"What can be done about these idiots, the violence will only get worse","filename":"IMG_2067","ext":".jpg","w":750,"h":1008,"tn_w":186,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492930031085,"time":1492930031,"md5":"+ntjSe92Lp2ksyOEqvsL8A==","fsize":128769,"resto":0,"id":"byZPAvx9","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"antifa","country_name":"United States","replies":44,"images":8,"omitted_posts":39,"omitted_images":8},{"no":122395484,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)03:24:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122394849\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122394849<\/a><br>My question is what is gonna stop them from resorting to bullets, if they back their talk with guns I don&#039;t want our guys getting shot","time":1492932266,"resto":122392478,"id":"byZPAvx9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122395494,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)03:24:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122395085\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122395085<\/a><br>That&#039;s why I said wait.

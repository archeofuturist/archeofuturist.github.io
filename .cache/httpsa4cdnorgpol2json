A human is a collection of animal urges with the good sense to control them. When you don&#039;t control the animal urges, you become an animal, which you can see for yourself when you look at people with low self-control: they live in squalor, they cannot help themselves, they routinely depend on others for survival, and everything about them is crude and dysfunctional. Animal behavior is the opposite of effective human labor, which makes it the opposite of civilization itself.<br>There was once a time society knew about this and handled it through understandings of vice and pro-social institutions. If you wanted to have sex, you&#039;d get married, and form a family that would promote excess labor, strong human bonds, and passing on society&#039;s values. If you wanted to laze about and stuff your face, you&#039;d have to work hard all year and then get to enjoy a holy day with your family. And you&#039;ll notice that all of those activities hold an air of extra meaning to them, of refinement, because the animalistic urge they satiate is wrapped up and obfuscated in privacy, the only birthplace of intimacy.<br><br>Discipline is humanity, civility is civilization. It is the fundamental and ongoing condition of civilization that people must be refined, civilized, and disciplined, and they get this way by having it imposed upon them, the way a child has the lessons of adulthood imposed upon them. It is guidance, and what is society if not family writ large?<br><br>Choosing freedom from guidance is not real freedom, because it ALWAYS costs you freedom from dependence. Just look at our society and its welfare state. The gluttons and single mother whores who live by others&#039; penny.<br>The problem with libertarianism is that any society guided exclusively by the rule of doing no immediate harm to others will sooner or later find itself incapable of following even that lone stipulation.","filename":"thdfrn","ext":".png","w":1605,"h":851,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":66,"tim":1493870076159,"time":1493870076,"md5":"xCoBDvJqQ5LO8OCBYFKgHA==","fsize":1024374,"resto":123988523,"id":"oAziuX\/u","country":"CA","m_img":1,"country_name":"Canada"},{"no":124014525,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)23:54:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124011753\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124011753<\/a><br>I like the pic<br>but isnt capitalism that?<br>not fascism?<br>facism might lead to some lazy shti as leaders boss thier servans and just have fun<br>so few have good life but most slave away <br>any only those things get funded which can convince these top tier<br><br>in capitalism kings thrown down nonstop as new products rise to replace old<br>free markets","time":1493870082,"resto":123988523,"id":"qwBMYDWN","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124014656,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)23:55:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124013625\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124013625<\/a><br>kekcellent","filename":"16252550_1241655005902816_342527346324625086_o","ext":".png","w":1336,"h":1022,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":95,"tim":1493870153235,"time":1493870153,"md5":"ZNnyCxSxLZfoFcjKoz5OjQ==","fsize":253508,"resto":123988523,"id":"qwBMYDWN","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124014936,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)23:58:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124014510\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124014510<\/a><br>you are so self contradictign here its insane<br>capitalism works fine<br>work or starve<br>its forced altruism<br>if you dont offer me something<br>fuck off n starve<br>so all win win<br>imagine if million of transaction win win all day all year all decade etc<br>we all be 1000x richer","time":1493870314,"resto":123988523,"id":"qwBMYDWN","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124015048,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)23:59:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123989856\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123989856<\/a><br><br>The similarity is that they are both ideologies of exceptionalism.

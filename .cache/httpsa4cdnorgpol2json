Jared Polis, (D-Colo.) said in testifying against the bill. &quot;They shouldn&#039;t be forced to sell and give that information to who-knows-who simply for the price of admission for access to the internet.&quot;<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The vote overturned rules passed in October by the Federal Communications Commission that tightened limits on what internet service providers (ISPs) could do with their users&#039; data. The rules, which would have taken effect later this year, required ISPs to notify consumers about the type of information they collect, and obtain their consent, before selling it to third parties. The rules also made ISPs more accountable for preventing data breaches.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The measure was passed on a 215-to-205 vote, with most Republicans in favor of the repeal and most Democrats against. It still needs to be signed by President Donald Trump before it will become law, though that appears to be a given after the White House expressed support for the repeal on Tuesday.<\/span>","filename":"eye_photo","ext":".jpg","w":630,"h":354,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1490754805390,"time":1490754805,"md5":"+Vdoka+8Dj\/1EQmmuVjm9A==","fsize":64093,"resto":0,"id":"\/id3Kskf","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"republicans-just-voted-to-let-internet-service","country_name":"United States","replies":197,"images":31,"omitted_posts":192,"omitted_images":31,"tail_size":50},{"no":118751277,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)01:19:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"I thought the plan was the buy the internet history of every politician who voted yes and post it","time":1490764758,"resto":118735165,"id":"eB3e5Vf0","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118751620,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)01:23:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118750705\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118750705<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;still has to pass congress though<\/span><br><br>It did pass Congress you fucking retard","time":1490764984,"resto":118735165,"id":"a8DtZKgf","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118752013,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)01:27:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118746915\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118746915<\/a><br>Didn&#039;t Cuckerberg flat out open the doors for the NSA, FBI and CIA from day 1?

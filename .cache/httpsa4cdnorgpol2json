My dad was always closer with my older brother, who was more of a Chad figure, while I was always bookish and introverted, so it was tough to really share a lot of experiences together. He also didn&#039;t teach me very much, or at least, it doesn&#039;t seem that way. I picked up a few things from him, like how to drive stick shift, how to cook an omelette, how to change the oil in my car, and maybe a few other things, but we never talked about politics, economics, girls, how to throw a punch, or very many meaty subjects. (My mom was the one who gave me &#039;the talk&#039; and the weekend away that my dad booked for us to have &#039;man time&#039; ended up with us not really talking, and him awkwardly asking if there was anything I wanted to ask about girls. I was already well into my BDSM fetish at the time, so I said no.)<br><br>Beyond his failures as a dad, like I mentioned, he has also been struggling a lot with his faith. He has always been very religious, but has recently expressed (in bits and pieces) that he has felt let down by religious ideas, which I think is really rocking him (I&#039;ve been an agnostic atheist\/agnostic theist since I was about 13). He mostly tries to shut out the modern world, but doesn&#039;t really know how to critique it or live in it, which I think contributes to his anxiety. He is a very submissive personality, and seems to prefer to let other people and authorities think for him (maybe too harsh, but he raised us kids as young earth creationists, so take that as you will). He doesn&#039;t lift weights, and doesn&#039;t seem to really have a goal for his life right now since the kids all moved out (except me). He was also laid off work for a while due to his lack of mental fitness, and has been recently re-hired to teach some high school classes, but is finding them exhausting and beyond his skills","time":1492726187,"resto":122037653,"id":"nuKbpExa","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122053037,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)18:14:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122052349\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122052349<\/a><br>I know Peterson says we need to rescue our fathers, but tbqhwyf, I feel very little emotion\/warmth towards my family, and would like to move away from them once I&#039;m done school.

So I&#039;ll try to summarise as easily as possible.<br>Firstly, you got Liberalism. Now in America and Australia, Liberalism this HUGE thing that has been there around each different kind of revolution. However, Liberalism is built on the idea of change. To change ones ideas to be inclusive and evolve to accept all. While this sounds nice at first, think about what this means in the long run. At first, it&#039;s accepting of Women&#039;s Rights to Vote, then Blacks, then gays then so on and so on. It&#039;s an organisation built on acceptance. Which again, sounds nice in theory, which is why a lot of young, white kids are attached to it. After all they grew up watching Saturday Morning cartoons about heroes who save the day, protect the people and do good.<br>This is why people are so attached to Liberalism. Twenty years ago, I would have been all for it too. But Leftism is an ideology that will, without fail, slowly consume itself. It begins to go full circle. Now you have to understand, leftists think they&#039;re heroes. They&#039;re people who can never do wrong, which is why Leftism itself can never be wrong. And so, they can never blame themselves for their or their ideologies failing and must blame someone else. Leftism has started to accept people that do not conform to the ideology itself. Namely Muslims. The Muslim religion is inherently conservative, and there are branches of the religion just like in Christianity or Cathlocism (see; sunni or shiite etc. etc.) that get more and more extreme as you go further and further right.<br><br>CONT","time":1490975061,"resto":119063781,"id":"WvQ09uyf","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":119067186,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)11:44:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119067159\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119067159<\/a><br>And now you begin to see the problem. Leftism and Liberalism, an ideology originally based on Liberty and Freedom, starts to accept people who are inherently against that. In Iran, it is against the law for Gays to exist without changing their sex. In Saudi Arabia Gays can be executed (in fact, there was a recent Saudi diplomat who applied for asylum in America after his sexual preferences were revealed due to fear of being behead).<br><br>Can you see the problem? Now you&#039;re probably thinking, what does this have to do with being white or proud of that fact? Well, it has to do with the acceptance, remember, they&#039;ve come full circle. They can&#039;t readily accept Muslims, but they also can&#039;t readily decline them. So they choose to simply bury their head in the sand, complain that it&#039;s racist to say anything about them and find someone to blame. And the easiest choice to blame people for their shortcomings, are whites. After all, their knowledge doesn&#039;t go outside of their own country, they only know what they know because of movies and what the inherently leftist colleges tell them. Whites were Nazi&#039;s, whites were there during colonization, whites were slave owners. etc. etc. Except what they fail to understand, is that all countries, both white, black, arab, asian and whatever else all did similar things. The Egyptians enslaved Jews. Africans sold out their own people and even today, still partake in slavery and genocide of religious groups. Chinese killed Tibetans, and millions of their own people. <br>But, these facts go against leftism. Remember, leftism and liberalism can never be wrong, they&#039;re the heroes, the ones that belong to liberty.","time":1490975083,"resto":119063781,"id":"WvQ09uyf","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"}]},{"posts":[{"no":119046001,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)07:02:24","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Syria General \/sg\/ - Jihadis Fertilazing Hama Edition","com":"Everything you need to know<br>https:\/\/syriagenerals.wordpress.com<wbr>\/<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;YouTube<\/span><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCS<wbr>elGrgxKyKFrugrfns3FBA\/<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Twitter<\/span><br>https:\/\/twitter.com\/SyriaGeneral<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;SOUTHFRONT Mar30<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/G1lSA4qVEjc<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Newest Interviews with Assad<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/ZpgYBIDk43Q<br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/MlrpvKNl9D8<br><br>PERMANENT MAPS<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Maeplet<\/span><br>http:\/\/maeplet.com\/<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Livemap<\/span><br>https:\/\/globaleventmap.org<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;hohol livemap<\/span><br>http:\/\/syria.liveuamap.com\/<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Military map<\/span><br>http:\/\/militarymaps.info\/<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Syria conflict map<\/span><br>http:\/\/www.cartercenter.org\/syria-c<wbr>onflict-map\/<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Fan maps<\/span><br>https:\/\/twitter.com\/syria_protector<wbr><br>https:\/\/twitter.com\/PetoLucem<br>https:\/\/twitter.com\/miladvisor<br>https:\/\/twitter.com\/a7_mirza<br>https:\/\/twitter.com\/hamza_780<br>http:\/\/www.edmaps.com<br>http:\/\/www.syriancivilwarmap.com<br><br>RECENT MAPS<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mosul Mar30<\/span><br>http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/Luv7Tbq.jpg<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;N Hama Mar30<\/span><br>http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/9YcRMnY.jpg<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Raqqa Mar30<\/span><br>http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/tN6z1Rs.jpg<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;E Aleppo Mar29<\/span><br>http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/3Drg0sJ.jpg<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Palmyra Mar27<\/span><br>http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/XMrCfiw.jpg<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Jobar Mar23<\/span><br>http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/gU1EPHN.jpg<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;DeZ Feb23<\/span><br>http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/NqoTYa2.jpg<br><br>Developments Mar30<br>US envoy to UN: Removing Assad in Syria &#039;not our priority&#039;<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;SAA preparing massive offensive inside DeZ<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;SAA destories two HTS bases in Daraa<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;N Hama:Jihadist begin phase 2 target Al-Mughayr and Bredeij areas<\/span><br>SAA liberates Arzeh and Balhiseen towns,retake Tall Al Samsam, begin bombing of Khattab<br>Jihadis retreated their main forces to Khattab, also show off captured T90 tank in N Hama<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Syrian-Iraq cooperate to destroy largest IS base in DeZ<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Uk,USA, France,Ukraine blocked a RU proposal @ UN to blacklist group AhrarAlSham<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;nursa forces Idlib druze to convert or be killed<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Turkey:Euphrates Shield operation successfully completed<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Video of IS using a child as a human shield in Mosul emerges<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;YEMENI FORCES LAUNCH FRESH ATTACK AGAINST SAUDI-LED COALITION IN JAWF GOVERNORATE<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Saudi airstrike kills 8 children in Yemen<\/span><br><br>Previous: <a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/119017950#p119017950\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119017950<\/a>","filename":"C8LtE4QVYAAwE-_","ext":".jpg","w":1200,"h":675,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1490958144912,"time":1490958144,"md5":"e\/MZePIv2fMX8ZUBV1QqTg==","fsize":92742,"resto":0,"id":"tJxq09hO","country":"PL","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"syria-general-sg-jihadis-fertilazing-hama-edition","country_name":"Poland","replies":297,"images":81,"omitted_posts":292,"omitted_images":79,"tail_size":50},{"no":119066684,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)11:39:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119065161\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119065161<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I thought this was just some anti-ISIS, general Kurdish independence shit.<\/span><br>That&#039;s Iraqi Kurdistan, the western MSM usually just report everything as &quot;kurds&quot;, despite the fact that there are 2 kurdish quasi-states governed by 3 major parties with different ideologies and alignments.","time":1490974744,"resto":119046001,"id":"\/987tI5j","country":"HU","country_name":"Hungary"},{"no":119066922,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)11:41:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119049960\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119049960<\/a><br>Aren&#039;t the Kurds commies.

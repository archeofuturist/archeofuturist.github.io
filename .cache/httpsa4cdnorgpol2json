He&#039;s had the balls to go at it with Sam Harris, a professional debater, twice. Do you think Sargon would be willing to take on that kind of risk to his reputation when instead he can just continually take easy positions like &quot;human rights need to be respected&quot; or &quot;communism is bad&quot; and then say &quot;huhuhu these feminists are so salty huhuhu&quot;","time":1491655462,"resto":120123804,"id":"QEZNci4h","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":120124053,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)08:05:01","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Niggers Jews and Muslims","com":"And this is why I don&#039;t go to college<br><br>He&#039;s a muslim too btw","filename":"IMG_9868","ext":".jpg","w":750,"h":704,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":234,"tim":1491653101082,"time":1491653101,"md5":"Flk13605BT\/Ob+1YC78uTg==","fsize":160017,"resto":0,"id":"MmPclMcK","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"niggers-jews-and-muslims","country_name":"United States","replies":33,"images":10,"omitted_posts":28,"omitted_images":9},{"no":120126872,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)08:38:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120124777\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120124777<\/a><br>checked","filename":"image","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":500,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491655129131,"time":1491655129,"md5":"ZYPFqQecB8HDHKbUVzeUzQ==","fsize":59496,"resto":120124053,"id":"Ar88eHah","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120126971,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)08:40:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120124870\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120124870<\/a><br>post more tomochrist-chan","time":1491655213,"resto":120124053,"id":"GGCl7Md1","country":"ID","country_name":"Indonesia"},{"no":120127135,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)08:42:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Rich parents <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Met Clinton <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;SJW CV<\/span><br>He got in for completely different reasons. the BLM bullshit did fuck all but create headlines for media outlets that have nothing better to report on <br><br>Also OP you don&#039;t go to college cause US prices are retarded, or you are retarded yourself","filename":"1460121_420339088113318_5643878689479668588_n","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":640,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491655323957,"time":1491655323,"md5":"PIrVhleWvtVlZ+NXAM6yvA==","fsize":71225,"resto":120124053,"id":"Ub1FKBmZ","country":"CH","country_name":"Switzerland"},{"no":120127237,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)08:43:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120126971\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120126971<\/a><br>i only have 2 of her<br><a href=\"#p120127135\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120127135<\/a><br>but its a funny headline. admittedly","filename":"1491332533460","ext":".jpg","w":927,"h":1200,"tn_w":96,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491655406823,"time":1491655406,"md5":"mNdBD2KosEa0Ja1nehgZdw==","fsize":99302,"resto":120124053,"id":"4b9+fnLQ","country":"CH","m_img":1,"country_name":"Switzerland"},{"no":120127322,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)08:44:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"This is why I like my small comfy private college.

I&#039;m at the point where I still eat meat, but realise it is a selfish choice. As it stands right now, there is no rational reason for eating meat. Vegan diets are better for long term health. If the enviroment angle is how you wanna play it, vegan diets are more globally sustainable. Then there is the ethical side as well. I think the only cases where it is warranted to eat meat and it is not selfish is when you&#039;ve either hunted the animal yourself, or if it was raised as livestock on a small scale farm (i.e you raised it or your neighbour raised it etc). Also if you do not have the means to obtain nutritional profile from eating a vegan diet in your area (don&#039;t have access to a large food\/supplement store). Feel free to prove me wrong I am open ears. Also some other things, pls no appeal to nature arguments (I used to think this was the zinger against veganism but muh evoloution is a terrible argument). And no eating meat makes you a man meme. How the fuck is eating something that was raised by another man in a sterile enviroment manly? If you hunted a great beast and you feast on it, yeah thats manly, but a farmed manly is ultimate cuckery.","filename":"AAEAAQAAAAAAAASQAAAAJGE0N2NhYjZjLWEzZTItNDFjNS05ODg4LWFmZTBlMzQyMmU1ZA","ext":".jpg","w":698,"h":400,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":143,"tim":1490925701635,"time":1490925701,"md5":"ViJk2hvmPQW+qPlEgRGdDg==","fsize":56164,"resto":0,"id":"D4pXUvVp","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"veganism","country_name":"Canada","replies":220,"images":26,"omitted_posts":215,"omitted_images":26,"tail_size":50},{"no":119030175,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)02:39:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119029737\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119029737<\/a><br>South Korea consumption per capita of meat and see food is 110 kg per year. in Russia it is 90 kg.

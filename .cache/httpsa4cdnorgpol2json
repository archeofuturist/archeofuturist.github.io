If I restate what you said using a double negative you&#039;ll see how it&#039;s retarded. &quot;God has a chance of not existing, therefore because he COULD exist somewhere he can&#039;t possibly not exist.&quot; That&#039;s the most retarded thing I&#039;ve ever heard.<br><br>Second off, you assume in this &quot;proof&quot; that just because logic follows that means it&#039;s a valid truth claim.

I can&#039;t just posit anything technically possible and therefore it has some degree of potential truth to it, much less an infalsifiable hypothesis such as &quot;God&quot; existing in an uninteractable dimensional space separate from our own. A truth claim&#039;s validity hinges on whether or not supporting information shows it to be likely. A truth claim not based on reality, even if it is in fact true, has no validity regardless.","filename":"aminay is saved","ext":".jpg","w":478,"h":471,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":123,"tim":1490803140932,"time":1490803140,"md5":"\/Em4WNP8QERMCK+ddcUFHg==","fsize":24540,"resto":118786431,"id":"jLNGyuQw","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118799645,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)11:59:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118799472\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118799472<\/a><br>Prove those posts can be trusted.","time":1490803144,"resto":118786431,"id":"wKw2WlnM","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":118799678,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)11:59:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118786431\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118786431<\/a><br><br>How could it be rational to believe anything on faith?

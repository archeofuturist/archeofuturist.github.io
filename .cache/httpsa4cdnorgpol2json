Without genetic variation, a population cannot evolve in response to changing environmental variables and, as a result, may face an increased risk of extinction. For example, if a population is exposed to a new disease, selection will act on genes for resistance to the disease if they exist in the population. But if they do not exist \u2014 if the right genetic variation is not present \u2014 the population will not evolve and could be wiped out by the disease.&quot;","time":1492194467,"resto":121086554,"id":"7XwO4TcU","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121093778,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)14:27:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121092045\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121092045<\/a><br>Stop posting this woman.","time":1492194475,"resto":121086554,"id":"VgjxaBh6","country":"MX","country_name":"Mexico"},{"no":121093950,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)14:29:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"Latinas are the hottest so any white person who keeps talking about &quot;race mixing&quot; is faggot supreme.","time":1492194566,"resto":121086554,"id":"Wn5BQYzr","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"}]},{"posts":[{"no":121077780,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)12:11:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Moshe Kasher destroys antisemitism in 2 minutes (starts at 2:00:35)<\/span><br><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/nNJ5p6sAn6I<br><br>Well, \/pol\/?","filename":"Screenshot_20170414-120739","ext":".png","w":2560,"h":1440,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1492186302744,"time":1492186302,"md5":"HIVLoPAww5jONQWp1sbYzA==","fsize":2538216,"resto":0,"id":"6ZHELwKZ","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"moshe-kasher-destroys-antisemitism-in-2-minutes","country_name":"United States","replies":94,"images":26,"omitted_posts":89,"omitted_images":21},{"no":121093275,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)14:23:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121092719\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121092719<\/a><br>Seriously, this place is really not much different from r\/T_D","filename":"1491944959562","ext":".jpg","w":226,"h":225,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":124,"tim":1492194223492,"time":1492194223,"md5":"UwPQrraHvjiKDZhECS7Mbw==","fsize":17906,"resto":121077780,"id":"6ZHELwKZ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121093492,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)14:25:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121092888\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121092888<\/a><br><br>The Jewish IQ is a fucking myth.

With respect to Hillary Clinton, there was ZERO effect on her campaign because they were simply an indictment of the DNC ran under Obama era, revealing massive pay to play ordeals. However, NO news station picked up on the DNC leaks because you had to combthrough spans of financial documents and connect dots. What was damaging about those leaks was that the SSN, phone, and most personal details of mega millionaires were leaked into the net. Th DNC leaks very well could have been from Eastern Europe or Russia, and as the result of a hack. The podesta emails were received from a phishing scheme that may or may not have been launched by Russian agents.

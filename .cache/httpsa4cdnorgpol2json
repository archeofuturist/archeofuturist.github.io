Niggers in Africa have an average IQ of 70 which is the mental retardation line. Thus the average black African is literally retarded. In 1700 most of Africa had not invented the wheel, the alphabet or written language. Then white people came and build Africans a civilization. We built cities, skyscrapers, universities, factories, roads, bridges, churches, libraries, and houses. In 1960 when imperialists still where in Africa, Africa was 10% of world GDP, now despite comprising an exponentially larger percentage of the worlds population than it did in the 60&#039;s Africa has declined to only 4% of GDP. There are no African or Arab universities that can even compare to a low level American or European university. The few black scientists that exist will never measure up to white geniuses. Almost all of the worlds greatest minds of all time where White Western Europeans with a few Jews thrown in there. We are the master race. Niggers after having been given a civilization by us fucked it up because we left them alone with it.

A people&#039;s success can be partially measured by their capability to create high trust societies, something slavs seem to be incapable of doing. Violence and corruption seem to be synonymous with slavic nations, and appear to diminish the further away you get from Russia, with Poland being one of the better slavic countries.<br><br>Of course, the downside to a high trust society, is that it becomes self-destructive when that same trust is taken for granted and is extended to third world immigrants, who don&#039;t share the trustful, egalitarian nature of the host population. So perhaps the violent, corrupt, immoral tendencies of the slavs it what will save them from suffering the same fate as western Europe.<br><br>I know some people on \/pol\/ seem to love slavs for their resistance to immigration, but they don&#039;t seem to understand its root cause.","time":1493756726,"resto":123801753,"id":"iinexTlk","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":123814545,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)16:27:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123804231\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123804231<\/a><br>Poland<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;stopped muslim invasion and chased ottomans back to their country<\/span><br>Burgerland<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;financing islamic terrorists, support coup in Iran<\/span><br><br>Poland<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;stopped communist expansion in 1920<\/span><br>Burgerland<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;hq of the most retarded version of communism.<\/span>","time":1493756830,"resto":123801753,"id":"4WZrYCNA","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":123814625,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)16:27:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123814299\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123814299<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;morality is main reason why Poland got fucked in XVI century<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;slavs have no morality<\/span>","filename":"1478655054919","ext":".png","w":388,"h":587,"tn_w":82,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493756862764,"time":1493756862,"md5":"C6g6SI\/QiDvWdww4dnMWig==","fsize":249297,"resto":123801753,"id":"b5buHkt6","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":123814813,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)16:29:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123801753\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123801753<\/a><br>why Northern Spanish Basques?","time":1493756940,"resto":123801753,"id":"xhc4o3fw","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123814891,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)16:29:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123814299\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123814299<\/a><br>Dude, moral relativism, lmao<br>Congratulation putz, you played yourself.","time":1493756980,"resto":123801753,"id":"KPIKc1un","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"}]},{"posts":[{"no":123793871,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)13:47:27","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Mediteranian Master Race Thread","com":"In this thread we list and discuss the accomplishments of the Mediteranian Master Race.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Built the pyramids.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Created electricity long before they said it Was discovered.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The space program.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Cellphones<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The TV.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;We conquerd America.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Helped the Jews to run away from egypt.<\/span><br><br>Also.

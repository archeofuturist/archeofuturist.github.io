The difference is that I am still paying my dues, because my hall trained me. My hall negotiated my hourly. My hall manages my medical. My hall makes sure I have a pension.

Maybe it&#039;s because we live in an oligarchy that has guaranteed that regular normal folks like ourselves, workers, will be under the thumb of multinational globalist corporations who incarcerate people en masse, who wage war in countries so that our brothers and cousins can go die for their profit, who gives massive tax breaks to only the megarich which none of us will every have access to and who guarantee that we will always fight amongst each other in a divide and conquer strategy. This is manufactured so that we never unite against them EVER.

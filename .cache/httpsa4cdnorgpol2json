Since then, I&#039;ve been enthralled and enlightened by some of the cool dialoguing going on here. I&#039;ve noticed a bit of a fallacy in the dialogue though and as an outsider it&#039;s been really sharp to me. How can you guys hate on Israel when it&#039;s by far the most based country. Let&#039;s look at the facts:<br>1. Strong against Muslims<br>2. Democratic with liberty and justice for all<br>3. Strong military<br>4. Lot&#039;s of entrepreneurs like Trump<br>5. Strong culture and history<br>6. Pretty traditional women<br><br>We sort of lose credibility as a movement when we deride Israel due to our emotions.

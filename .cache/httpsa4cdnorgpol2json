Trump and brexit were the final dying gasps of the white race. You know hes not gonna win in 2020 right? You know le Pen will not win right? You failed in austria and netherlands, and dont even make me laugh thinking you can uncuck germany or sweden.

This is your last hurrah before this country, and Europe become irreversibly brown, and very liberal. Oh and also the browns are so pissed at you whites for the centuries of racism and discrimination, that they are gonna do it to you tenfold when they get in the seats of power - so the unlucky bunch of you who will live to see it happen, may God have mercy on you.

These useful idiots are instrumental in Russia\u2019s plan of portraying the United States as a neo-nazi, racist country bent on world supremacy. The KGB was the hotbed of anti-zionist and anti-American conspiracies, and its organisations (like the World Peace Council) have spewed anti-American propaganda since their early days.<br><br>The end goal is not to bring about a nuclear winter in the West, but to merge with it under the Soviets\u2019 terms. The annexation of Crimea was merely an example of a problem created to propose a solution and make Russia look open to cooperation. Another example is the Russian financing of Jihadist groups (exposed in Litvinenko\u2019s book \u201cBlowing Up Russia\u201d, shortly after releasing which he was killed by KGB agents in London). This is where the whole \u201cle saviour of Europa\u201d meme comes from: since there is no terror in Russia itself, Europeans perceive its policies as the deterrent to Islamic Jihad.

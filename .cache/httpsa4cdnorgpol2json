When Christians took over Rome the greek lettera for JC, Jesus Christ, the chi rho, was the symbol, and they banned crucifying people. The cross is a medieval innovation.<br><br>Also, I dont believe in powerful relics, but I do believe in supernatural power like the Holy Spirit and that all Christians can cast out devils. Be careful though. Catholics having it be rare, and only with exorcists is a shame to Christ. Appointed specialists is good, but devils are very common. The average catholic exorcism takes 2 years on average, its not like the movies, and its bcos their faith is dead. There is no hard evidence of anyone praying to marry for hundreds of years, let alone her title as &quot;queen of heaven.&quot; In the OT some Jews got into idoltry for worshilling the alleged &quot;queen of heaven&quot;. Dont think the same demon behind that deceit wouldnt cloak itself as Mary to deceive.<br><br>In Luke 28 someone tells Jesus lines from the rosary, snd he responds rather blessed are they that hear the word of God.

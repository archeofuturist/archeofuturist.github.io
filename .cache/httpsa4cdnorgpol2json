It opens with the<br>autobiographical &quot;Mama,&quot; that&#039;s both strange and touching, though I<br>couldn&#039;t tell if the singer was talking about his actual mother or to a<br>girl he likes to call &quot;Mama.&quot; &#039;That&#039;s All&quot; is a lover&#039;s lament about<br>being ignored and beaten down by an unreceptive partner; despite<br>the despairing tone it&#039;s got a bright sing-along melody that makes the<br>song less depressing than it probably needed to be. &quot;That&#039;s All&quot; is<br>the best tune on the album, but Phil&#039;s voice is strongest on &quot;House<br>by the Sea,&quot; whose lyrics are, however, too stream-of-consciousness<br>to make much sense. It might be about growing up and accepting<br>adulthood but it&#039;s unclear; at any rate, its second instrumental part<br>puts the song more in focus for me and Mike Banks gets to show off<br>his virtuosic guitar skills while Tom Rutherford washes the tracks<br>over with dreamy synthesizers, and when Phil repeats the song&#039;s<br>third verse at the end it can give you chills.","time":1491765190,"resto":120320195,"id":"AbGueAG3","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":120321256,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)15:14:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"&quot;Illegal Alien&quot; is the most explicitly political song the group has yet<br>recorded and their funniest. The subject is supposed to be sad - a<br>wetback trying to get across the border into the United States - but<br>the details are highly comical: the bottle of tequila the Mexican<br>holds, the new pair of shoes he&#039;s wearing (probably stolen); and it all<br>seems totally accurate. Phil sings it in a brash, whiny pseudo-<br>Mexican voice that makes it even funnier, and the rhyme of &quot;fun&quot;<br>with &quot;illegal alien&quot; is inspired. &quot;Just a Job to Do&quot; is the album&#039;s<br>funkiest song, with a killer bass line by Banks, and though it seems<br>to be about a detective chasing a criminal, I think it could also be<br>about a jealous lover tracking someone down. &quot;Silver Rainbow&quot; is<br>the album&#039;s most lyrical song. The words are intense, complex and<br>gorgeous. The album ends on a positive, upbeat note with &quot;It&#039;s<br>Gonna Get Better.&quot; Even if the lyrics seem a tiny bit generic to<br>some, Phil&#039;s voice is so confident (heavily influenced by Peter<br>Gabriel, who never made an album this polished and heartfelt<br>himself) that he makes us believe in glorious possibilities.<br>Invisible Touch is the group&#039;s undisputed<br>masterpiece.","time":1491765255,"resto":120320195,"id":"AbGueAG3","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":120321259,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)15:14:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"Phil Collins is a nigger","time":1491765255,"resto":120320195,"id":"OIdG+2fs","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":120321297,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)15:14:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"It&#039;s an epic meditation on intangibility, at the same time<br>it deepens and enriches the meaning of the preceding three albums.<br>It has a resonance that keeps coming back at the listener, and the<br>music is so beautiful that it&#039;s almost impossible to shake off because<br>every song makes some connection about the unknown or the spaces<br>between people (&quot;Invisible Touch&quot;), questioning authoritative<br>control whether by domineering lovers or by government (&quot;Land of<br>Confusion&quot;) or by meaningless repetition (&quot;Tonight Tonight<br>Tonight&#039;.

Take the lyrics to &quot;Land<br>of Confusion,&quot; in which a singer addresses the problem of abusive<br>political authority. This is laid down with a groove funkier and<br>blacker than anything Prince or Michael Jackson - or any other black<br>artist of recent years, for that matter - has come up with. Yet as<br>danceable as the album is, it also has a stripped-down urgency that<br>not even the overrated Bruce Springsteen can equal. As an observer<br>of love&#039;s failings Collins beats out the Boss again and again,<br>reaching new heights of emotional honesty on &quot;In Too Deep&quot;; yet it<br>also showcases Collins&#039; clowny, prankish, unpredictable side. It&#039;s the<br>most moving pop song of the 1980s about monogamy and<br>commitment. &quot;Anything She Does&quot; (which echoes the J. Geils Band&#039;s<br>&quot;Centerfold&quot; but is more spirited and energetic) starts off side two<br>and after that the album reaches its peak with &quot;Domino,&quot; a two-part<br>song. Part one, &quot;In the Heat of the Night,&quot; is full of sharp, finely<br>drawn images of despair and it&#039;s paired with &quot;The Last Domino,&quot;<br>which fights it with an expression of hope. This song is extremely<br>uplifting. The lyrics are as positive and affirmative as anything I&#039;ve<br>heard in rock.","time":1491765291,"resto":120320195,"id":"AbGueAG3","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"}]},{"posts":[{"no":120306396,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)13:17:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"Name one reason not to nuke us<br><br>Also based Dailymail always naming the rapefugee","filename":"2017-04-09--19_11_41","ext":".jpg","w":1187,"h":1420,"tn_w":208,"tn_h":249,"tim":1491758233328,"time":1491758233,"md5":"GEiZ1EoOr\/fS6Srn\/3UYzQ==","fsize":760896,"resto":0,"id":"0lghm18i","country":"DE","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"name-one-reason-not-to-nuke-us","country_name":"Germany","replies":47,"images":10,"omitted_posts":42,"omitted_images":9},{"no":120320720,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)15:10:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120306396\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120306396<\/a><br><br>how can you German cucks just sit there and let something like that happen? the rapefugee only had a machete and you&#039;re on a fucking camping trip? where was your knife or axe or brain?","time":1491765031,"resto":120306396,"id":"AbHD15Jw","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120320810,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)15:11:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120311456\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120311456<\/a><br>DM manages to offend all sides of the political spectrum and i admire it for that.","filename":"IMG_0906","ext":".png","w":1334,"h":750,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":70,"tim":1491765069419,"time":1491765069,"md5":"oN370nDPwLLCXlKV6XvQ3w==","fsize":755583,"resto":120306396,"id":"fEalWtWF","country":"GB","m_img":1,"country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120320881,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)15:11:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120316936\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120316936<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;hold knife to woman&#039;s neck as you fuck her<\/span><br><br>Gee guess I&#039;m a fucking genius you fucking armchair tough guy.<br><br>So sick of fucking autistic, socially inept, mongoloid, mouth breathing, fucking retards acting like they&#039;re hot shit and that human psychology doesn&#039;t apply to them.<br><br>Imagine being home invaded in the middle of the night by a single man.

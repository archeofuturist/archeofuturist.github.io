Repeal handgun ban, repeal all limits on magazine capacity, repeal &#039;assault&#039; rifles ban that limit then to .22 and semi-auto or manual action. Police issued licence required only for full auto LMG tier weapons and destructive weapons or bigger explosives. Totally legalise SBRs and suppressors. Allow OC and CC with state issued licence. Offer government sponsored training as part of the OC and CC application process to encourage as many people as possible to do it. Castle doctrine, stand your ground, etc. Reopen every case with the intention to release all currently imprisoned people who were convicted of assault\/manslaughter against an intruder in their home or on their property; and pardon everyone who has already been released having served their sentence on similar charges.<br><br>I also think we should bring in mandatory 18 month national service for every male over 18 in either military or security services. Women should have 1 year national service in a caring role such as nurse\/teaching assistant\/childcare or elderly care. Leave school at 18, do your service, enter the job market as a mature and competent adult at either 19 or 20. Possibly let certain (white British) people skip their national service to study an in-demand STEM field at university if they show real promise.

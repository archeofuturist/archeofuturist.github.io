He promised he would do things, then when he tried to do them they kind of fell apart (travel ban, repeal obamacare, get mexico to pay for the wall, etc).<br><br>You can look at this two ways:<br>1. Trump is incompetent and severely misjudged what he can actually do as president. He was cocky and thought just marching into the oval office meant he could do anything he wanted with no resistance. He thought things in DC work like his real estate deals, and that was not the case.<br><br>Or<br><br>2. He knows exactly what he&#039;s doing and doing what he&#039;s been doing strategically. Basically playing the long game. He can say that he tried to deliver on his promises and the &quot;swamp&quot; shut him down. At that point the people that voted Trump in will be more riled up and demand that the people stopping his progress either play along or get voted out of office. This does require that Trump&#039;s supporters stay loyal, and that the people who hate him don&#039;t decide to become more more active in local politics, though, which makes it a risky gamble. If Trump seems weak and ineffectual, he risks losing supporters and driving the left in America to get much more serious about getting him out of office\/getting democrats in the house and senate\/trying to impeach him, etc. However, if Trump does retain followers and the left stays shattered and cucked, this has the possibility of getting him more power as people vote out anyone who doesn&#039;t tow the line with Trump.

Rockefeller, Carnegie, and J. P. Morgan were making what would be hundreds of billions a day through manipulation of their workers. Their workers would live in towns these people would built but have no room to progress forward. People were exposed to harsh conditions and payed very little, no matter how hard they worked. Everything was owned by the conglomerates; the houses, the stores, the factories, it was basically a small city state. Along with this there was no room at all for competition because the monopolies bought them all up, claimed all the resources, and bankrupted their competitors. <br>Only when did the United States realize that these monopolists were gaining more control and lobbying the government it became a concern. Here the Sherman Anti-Trust act comes into play and breaks up monopolies and allows competition to compete. The world does much better without monopolies just viewing people as a recourse, while basically enslaving them and putting a false facade that there might be hope you will progress and become the next millionaire, but with a system like that in place, the millionaires make sure they stay rich and the poor stay poor. It isn&#039;t always a matter of intelligence but of the willingness to not view another as a human but as something to exploit.","filename":"Ancap_vs_NatSoc","ext":".png","w":1094,"h":300,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":68,"tim":1490502358663,"time":1490502358,"md5":"yPIcoW4HxpB8a3y9QVNTfA==","fsize":27324,"resto":0,"id":"pmub+yKv","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"ancap-v-natsoc-thread","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0},{"no":118319414,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)00:29:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;lobbying the government<\/span><br><br>What government?","time":1490502555,"resto":118319137,"id":"vYPMjifC","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118316179,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)23:52:45","name":"Anonymous","sub":"\/hkg\/ - Hong Kong General","com":"Counting has begun in the Hong Kongese Chief Executive Election: <br>http:\/\/www.straitstimes.com\/asia\/ea<wbr>st-asia\/election-committee-to-choos<wbr>e-hong-kongs-new-chief-executive-am<wbr>id-growing-calls-for<br><br>Essentially, 2,000 influential Hong Kongese people get to vote, and nobody else.

The resulting multi-lens system provides an opportunity to help correct aberration, a condition where lenses fail to bring all wavelengths of color to a single focal point, which in turn may facilitate higher quality imaging from smaller devices, researchers added.<br><br>The researchers developed the 3D lenses by blasting a light-sensitive material onto a glass substrate with a femtosecond laser, which has pulse durations shorter than 100 femtoseconds. The material then absorbed two photons that exposed it and crosslinked polymers within the material. The unexposed material was washed using a solvent, leaving the hardened, crosslinked polymer that will then serve as the optical element.<br><br>The resulting lens\u2019 diameter measures about 120 millionths of a meter, which makes it easily as small as a grain of table salt. The lenses can go from wide to narrow and may provide low to high image resolutions. Each of the lenses has a specific line of sight \u2013 clear at the center, blurry at the sides \u2013 capped by a curvature at the end. This mechanism mimics how the fovea, the small depression in the middle of the retina, collects light, and how the brain connects images from both eyes to come up with a single, distinct picture.","filename":"bre1","ext":".jpg","w":1084,"h":626,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":144,"tim":1490498345935,"time":1490498345,"md5":"XC6zDkcjKPwFMqlYjpudRQ==","fsize":72220,"resto":0,"id":"5bQNx5UM","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"its-over-niggers-the-jews-won","country_name":"United States","replies":76,"images":19,"omitted_posts":71,"omitted_images":19},{"no":118319192,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)00:26:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"lmao, burgers are so stupid.","time":1490502399,"resto":118312846,"id":"cUGPtcp+","country":"NZ","country_name":"New Zealand"},{"no":118319254,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)00:27:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118319181\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118319181<\/a><br><br>As you can see the 2015 hype cycle is different than the 2013, they practically gave up on those retarded notions.<br><br><a href=\"#p118318841\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118318841<\/a><br><br>Black Ops attempted to use it, and failed, geofencing is a lot more effective.","time":1490502439,"resto":118312846,"id":"qwebG9y5","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118319309,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)00:28:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118319192\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118319192<\/a><br><br>Pretty much.

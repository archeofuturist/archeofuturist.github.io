At the tribunal, the couple said they prayed in their bedroom and the floor had to remain clean. Yet Alabi claims the couple never had a problem before when he wore his shoes to make repairs in the apartment. And he wasn\u2019t wearing outside shoes, but the shoes he wore in his own home. He\u2019d come around to their apartment wearing rubbers over them and then take them off at the door.

It\u2019s not a fucking puzzle, all the history is on the sites. There you crossed ur nerdy hobbies with ur nerdy resentment. Bunch of fucking nerds with your dipshit teenage beefs probably started with a resentment of woman who won\u2019t speak to you and now you think you have become POI radicalized.<br>So how did it happen? How did you become a fucking nazi? A bunch of real Nazis whispered poison in your ears while becoming your only community, your only \u201cfriends\u201d. And they used multiple levels to make irony and bigotry and fascism more acceptable by drowning it in \u201coh we\u2019re just joking\u201d So you combine all this with capitalizing on isolated nerd dude resentment and even deeper isolation, BAM nazi.<br>You can talk to any former \u201cchan\u201d boy and they can tell you how it went from \u201cshotty shock humor\u201d to \u201cwhite supremacist recruitment\u201d. The \u201clol only normies care about hurting others attitude\u201d + the general nerd male resentment of these communities. Its prime fertile ground for actual Nazis to grow.

R9K\u2019s \u201cwho wont woman fuck me\u201d bs \u201canything goes and anyone who gets mad is just a normie\u201d vs endless outbursts of anger at everything. Pol here becomes less of an isolated phenomenon and more of a natural end point for all these circles crashing into one another. And pol, also being its own thing, emans it is rolled back into those communities amplifying your worst aspect then roll it back into pol.<br>So essentially you have an online pressure cooker to turn your typical teenage nerdy bullshit into honest to god fascism. The surrounding of hateful idedas, the detachment from the harm you do? Turning them into \u201cjust jokes\u201d becoming your only friends and that just your community you can see it in many others but again your not a fucking mystery","filename":"IMG_3926","ext":".jpg","w":525,"h":594,"tn_w":220,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492091363779,"time":1492091363,"md5":"jHWc0tMpv2AGlfB+J8oe0A==","fsize":84467,"resto":0,"id":"tM+HU12p","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"literally-shakespeare","country_name":"United States","replies":85,"images":34,"omitted_posts":80,"omitted_images":32},{"no":120924686,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)11:57:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120911329\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120911329<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;you&#039;re a nerd!1!!1!1 a nazi nerd!!1<\/span><br>mentally, Shia is still in middle school","filename":"1490290685766","ext":".png","w":452,"h":510,"tn_w":110,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492099055636,"time":1492099055,"md5":"h4JQhRVyyzKoykvnqT7oLg==","fsize":411225,"resto":120911329,"id":"COIH6XbJ","country":"CO","country_name":"Colombia"},{"no":120924805,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)11:58:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120911329\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120911329<\/a><br>....

The Romans carried this one step beyond any other society and gave him, as paterfamilias, full legal authority, potestas, over the rest of the family, including adult children. When a woman married in the early Republic she left the authority of her father and entered into the manus of her husband, occupying a place in her new home close to that of a daughter. [1] A first century jurist recounts the story of a man in the early days of the Republic beating his wife to death because she had drunk some wine. His neighbors approved.&quot;<br>And as time goes by women gain power. From same article.<br>&quot;Even as the Republic drew to a close more and more Romans were questioning the argument that women were too capricious and impulsive to be safely allowed to look out for their own best interests and many wondered if perhaps it was time to get rid of laws that were clearly based on a false premise.&quot;<br>&quot;All of this, of course, meant very little to the woman who had no money anyway, nor did it make a difference for the young women whose fathers were still alive, and the regulations that kept women out of government remained in place, but those few women who did inherit money were better able to live life on their own terms than their ancestors ever dreamt possible. Women were perhaps on a path to a hitherto unimaginable degree of equality until the rise of Christianity with its objection to divorce and its exhortation that wives should obey their husbands.&quot;","filename":"1490277144374","ext":".jpg","w":678,"h":960,"tn_w":88,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492822749533,"time":1492822749,"md5":"uCQZxToG2my+qLxsvllSiQ==","fsize":164052,"resto":122187447,"id":"oDrUkxAd","country":"DK","country_name":"Denmark"},{"no":122212469,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)20:59:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122192416\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122192416<\/a><br>Let&#039;s be honest anons.<br><br>Having information is the first step to avoiding common pitfalls.

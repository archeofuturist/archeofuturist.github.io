I can&#039;t say I&#039;m the only black man who finds it hard to take pride in his own race after having years of constant and needless attacks defaming my skin color from insecure losers here. Why not bully asians or muslims? Do they not have much more to be ashamed of than our peaceful race? Mexicans get bullied less than us.<br>Like when its not just banter, when a meme is repeated over and over again, repeated systematically, it eventually becomes a truth irregardless of the intentions in repeating it. And that isn&#039;t just jokes any more then, then its harmful!<br>Would you call a black man a &quot;nigger&quot;(not true at all) to his face? Would you say to a kind, peaceful and hard working salt of the earth black that they are a &quot;nigger&quot;? Would you say those words to your fellow white brother? Are you starting to feel ashamed now? You fucking degenerate?<br><br>You\u2019re destroying national pride, you\u2019re dividing whites against each other, your doing the opposite of what you claim to support when you engage in this incredibly abhorrent behavior. So I encourage you to stop now.","filename":"file","ext":".jpg","w":2000,"h":1000,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492370019243,"time":1492370019,"md5":"bGjLNng+O\/hxSMvDEFOoMg==","fsize":399028,"resto":0,"id":"GwpBVy2\/","country":"BR","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"seriously-the-bullying-against-black-members-of","country_name":"Brazil","replies":124,"images":39,"omitted_posts":119,"omitted_images":36,"tail_size":50},{"no":121417197,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)17:24:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121399137\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121399137<\/a><br>All fucking niggers must fucking hang!","time":1492377899,"resto":121399137,"id":"WyW+TCIq","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121417235,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)17:25:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121416271\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121416271<\/a><br>Oh, wow.

I recognize what I choose to call Satan as the Opponent and Adversary, set to tempt man. The chief concept is the same, but the philosophical ramifications are different. Valentinian gnosticism, as far as I know, was an incredibly pessimistic philosophy in the sense that it saw the reason for material existence as a flaw in creation; theosophical and vedantic ideas, among others, recognize the necessity of a tempting force for there to be validity for free will; one must choose good over evil, and not be forced to; there must be a chance to abandon God, otherwise finding him amounts to nothing but automated and predestined machinations of one thing playing with itself, rather than seeing man as a true image God. <br><br>TL;DR: Satan is an angel of God with a mission. The Demiurge is a different way to approach the concept and presence of evil - in my opinion, one that necessitates a pessimistic attitude and lots of mental gymnastics.","time":1492370055,"resto":121384431,"id":"bo7SGFPf","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":121399286,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)15:14:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Fulfills and abolishes Jewish prophecy and law<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Became sin to save the world from sin<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The most quoted prophet in the Quran<\/span><br><br>How can anyone even begin to compete with the living Son of Man?<br><br>&quot;I am with you always, even unto the end of the world.&quot;

A year after Ruby Ridge came the siege of the Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Texas, where cultists had been stockpiling weapons and more than 1 million rounds of ammunition. The FBI eventually assaulted the compound, resulting in a blaze that killed more than 70 men, women, and children. The rumor that the feds intentionally set the fire persists among far-right groups and conspiracy peddlers like Alex Jones. The 1994 federal assault weapons ban solidified patriots&#039; belief that Washington was making final preparations to turn America into a totalitarian state.

Who the fuck cares?&quot; Come what may, the militia would be ready. When shit hit the fan, it would have a secret, fortified bugout location where we could bring our families. A new community might someday need to be built there. Massengale said that under his command, life in the bugout would be modeled after ancient Rome. Active, patched members of the California State Militia would be considered citizens, while lapsed members and outsiders would not. &quot;We need worker bees,&quot; he said. &quot;You wanna come in? We&#039;ll bring you in. You&#039;ll be down in the field growing food, gathering wood. We&#039;ll be the ones standing watch,&quot; he said.

Hahahaha!&quot;<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; I looked to the one black man in the group, a recruit who had family near the mass shooting in San Bernardino a week earlier. &quot;I hate to tell you, but I&#039;m in for the long count,&quot; he told the captain. &quot;So you&#039;ll be seeing my black ass here every time.&quot;<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; The captain responded that in his experience, black people were always the best at learning and executing orders. &quot;We need to see some more black asses, is what we need,&quot; he said.

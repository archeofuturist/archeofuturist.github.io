After ISIS arrived, Shia Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani issued his famous fatwa calling on all Iraqis to defend their country. Tens of thousands flocked to the Hashd al-Shaabi, or Popular Mobilization Units. In December 2016, they became an official arm of the Iraqi security forces.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;ISIS didn\u2019t weaken Iranian influence in Iraq, it put it on steroids.

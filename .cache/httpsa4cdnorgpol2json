There is so much contradictory and illogical reasoning in most red pill threads. This is my assessment:<br><br>- Jews are raised to question everything and seek logical explanations (which is why I enjoy being on \/pol\/, most people here come to question and have their beliefs challenged)<br>- Jews are disproportionately successful because of aforementioned questioning which leads to strong emphasis on education. (Jewish parents rival asian parents for being hard on kids to do well in school and in their careers).<br>- Almost all arguments against Jews I think are actually arguments against our current form of corrupted capitalism. People think the fact that Jews are successful in that system means they run it. This is incorrect. Rich people are controlling society. Disproportionate numbers of those rich people are Jews because of aforementioned tendency towards success, but they don&#039;t run the system anymore than other rich fucks do.<br>- Jews that recognize this seek to fight against the system with everyone else. How we (liberal) Jews fight it is by advocating for the same level of education for all people that we have gotten and for redistribution of wealth to others since we know the rich don&#039;t deserve all they have.<br>- Most other anti-jew stuff is just edgelord holocaust denial bullshit that is largely debunked but gets memed around here because it is funny\/some people are too dumb to get it&#039;s a joke.<br><br>Thoughts?","time":1492669457,"resto":121954769,"id":"+5yup6vr","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121963604,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)02:32:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121962882\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121962882<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Thoughts?<\/span><br>I think you came to \/pol\/ because your cousins in msm practically begged you to come and act as jidf to protect your tribe.

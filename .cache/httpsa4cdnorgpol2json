Romantic love was invented in the renaissance era before that women were seen as tools for unloading in.<br><br>Rape didnt exist because consensual sex didnt exist.<br><br>Evolution didnt keep up with these new customs. Women still need to feel scared during sex to properly enjoy it. Choke her until she almost dies to remind her you are in control. Leave marks and bruises on her body she is your property and you must mark your property. <br><br>Dont give her control over any aspect of your sex life. If she refuses sex take it or call an escort and fuck the escort in front of her. She will never get mad at you for cheating she gets turned on by you being desired by other woman. If a relationship ends because you cheated its because you were a bitch and apologized or even worse cried. Women don&#039;t care about you, they care about what you can provide them and nothing more. Do not show weakness, show dominance and frame every time.<br><br>I have fucked over 200 liberal feminist women while wearing my MAGA hat and they said I was the best dick they ever had. Women CRAVE testosterone, that&#039;s why they flock to feminism these days. Because men are low t beta pussy cucks who are afraid to take charge. At the end of the day though, they are just begging to be fucked and treated like what they are, chattel.","filename":"1492014531572","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":960,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1493883978121,"time":1493883978,"md5":"o1yQJqaIJhfoRVQY1dyqkQ==","fsize":343796,"resto":0,"id":"DsoYqxOZ","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"women-should-be-scared-during-sex-romantic-love","country_name":"United States","replies":70,"images":10,"omitted_posts":65,"omitted_images":9},{"no":124039484,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)04:42:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124039303\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124039303<\/a><br>damn, I remember watching old hindi movies on our government TV on Saturdays.","time":1493887357,"resto":124035900,"id":"Qb6zB72e","country":"NP","country_name":"Nepal"},{"no":124039520,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)04:43:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124038331\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124038331<\/a><br><br>Shit, fucking AI ruin everything","time":1493887392,"resto":124035900,"id":"fo8bXIKg","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124039550,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)04:43:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124039361\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124039361<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;.png (1.04 MB, 1061x800) <\/span><br>go back to <a href=\"\/b\/\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;&gt;\/b\/<\/a> + <a href=\"\/v\/\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;&gt;\/v\/<\/a>","time":1493887414,"resto":124035900,"id":"Qb6zB72e","country":"NP","country_name":"Nepal"},{"no":124039574,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)04:43:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124037992\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124037992<\/a><br>???","time":1493887434,"resto":124035900,"id":"3cqU6Od4","country":"MX","country_name":"Mexico"},{"no":124039628,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)04:44:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124039484\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124039484<\/a><br>Old Hindi movies I&#039;m talking 60s and 70s stuff are the best ever.

Le Pen runs this debate for the entire two hours - it&#039;s like watching Pence\/Kane again, only better. She gets in two very memorable jabs, one where she calls him out for fucking his teacher and another where she says &quot; a woman will lead France, either me or Mrs. Merkel.&quot; He stutters repeatedly and repeats dumb lines constantly and seems off topic, irritated, and generally full of shit. If you actually understand the policy topics you know that she dismantled him completely on each one. He frequently tries to wave his hands and jedi mind trick and she is ready for it and throws it back at him. This was the strongest debate performance I&#039;ve ever seen and one she needed. She even dangled a line about &quot;let&#039;s hope we don&#039;t find out you have a secret bank account in the Bahamas&quot; because she obviously knows about the big leak of his secret Caribbean bank account that&#039;s about to hit. She&#039;s running against an even stronger propaganda campaign than Trump was so she has to get everything right and get some luck to win and this debate is her getting everything right. If she does not win tonight and France is still holding elections after 5 years of Macron she&#039;ll win then. She absolutely exposed him as a pissant joke and schooled him on every single issue. He called her &quot;stupid&quot; repeatedly and made other derogatory remarks that would get him absolutely fucking shredded by US feminists. The French are watching and she changed a ton of minds today and redpilled a bunch of motherfuckers. Ignore all shills - I understand French politics, understand French, and understand what I saw with my own two eyes. Only the most deluded propaganda victim could see this as anything but a devastating ass-whooping laid down by Le Pen on Macron.","filename":"1492903836842","ext":".png","w":657,"h":527,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":200,"tim":1493868819229,"time":1493868819,"md5":"dSOBA3aVoeBfNgTcvuWmrg==","fsize":36227,"resto":0,"id":"J2SAI8FU","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"marine-le-pen-absoluely-destroyed-macron-in","country_name":"United States","replies":184,"images":37,"omitted_posts":179,"omitted_images":37,"tail_size":50},{"no":124039445,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)04:42:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124038174\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124038174<\/a><br><a href=\"#p124039075\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124039075<\/a><br>Not going to demoralize you but it&#039;s too late.<br><br>Macron won the first round with 24% despite 5 years of Hollande and 2 years of terrorism.<br><br>And then Marine Le Pen fucked up the debate totally yesterday, she acted like a child, she didn&#039;t have the right to be this sarcastic considering how France is in deep shit.

Free market in action or w\/e. If anyone can be an american being an american isn&#039;t really anything at all. Its a set of papers.

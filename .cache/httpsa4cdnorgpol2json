This is also unacceptable.<br><br>- A regime change can&#039;t be done for the same reasons: As soon as the leaders of NK would realize their end is coming they would go batshit crazy.<br><br>- Same goes for trade pressure from China e.g. since again, when the NK government would realize their reign is coming to an end they would probably kamikaze the whole country.<br><br><br>I don&#039;t really see an option to get out of this without loosing Seoul and without a long, bloody conflict BUT nuking NK straight ahead. Preemptive nuclear strike disabling any chances to react. But this again is impossible, since it would draw the attention of the whole world, anger many countries, make China go batshit crazy and has overall horrible implications since millions of civilians would die.<br><br>What do?","filename":"lead_960","ext":".jpg","w":960,"h":640,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1491818619651,"time":1491818619,"md5":"1kelpnBw8N383FTJVVSpoQ==","fsize":51461,"resto":0,"id":"kr\/ozFNv","country":"DE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"how-to-get-rid-of-north-korea","country_name":"Germany","replies":159,"images":24,"omitted_posts":154,"omitted_images":23,"tail_size":50},{"no":120458887,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)13:03:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"reality corresponds to my posting habits","time":1491843781,"resto":120420834,"id":"wyH1pXaX","country":"PH","country_name":"Philippines"},{"no":120459162,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)13:05:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120452749\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120452749<\/a>","filename":"benis","ext":".png","w":326,"h":494,"tn_w":82,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491843929274,"time":1491843929,"md5":"egKg6NBAc+uJBflRlzG74Q==","fsize":27109,"resto":120420834,"id":"z\/LgC8M9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120459475,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)13:08:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"What happened to the cozy Best Korea television streaming threads?<br><br>Was it was just a fishing survey to surface any .ch lurkers?","time":1491844117,"resto":120420834,"id":"wyH1pXaX","country":"PH","country_name":"Philippines"},{"no":120459794,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)13:11:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120420834\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120420834<\/a><br>Best solution:<br>Nuke the place till there&#039;s nothing left.<br>There&#039;s nothing worth saving there.

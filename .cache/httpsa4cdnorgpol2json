Provincial governors ruled their provinces like petty kings. They could do whatever the fuck they wanted. To liberalise, you first have to control. By taking control of the entirety of China Mao set the stage for an effective policy of reform. Reform without control is not reform, it&#039;s idealism.

The whole point is that Deng could implement his reforms WITHOUT &quot;civil war,&quot; due to centralisation. It never would have come to civil war though - Deng would have backed down - but saying &quot;we can just fight a war over it :)))))&quot; is not realistic. Trump opposes sanctuary cities and Los Angeles is one - is literally firing artillery into Los Angeles and going through and executing the Los Angeles public service a realistic solution to this conflict?

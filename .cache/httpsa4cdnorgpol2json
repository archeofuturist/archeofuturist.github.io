I lived in a house identical to my fellow masonic kid who ended up raping me thanks to a third mason family doing the old molest and sodomize trick. Drewsthatdude. While my family life was filled with countless abuse, his was relatively lax. Scouts in the basement of a Catholic church to twice a week pentecostal AoG plus other non denominations in a tour of the region. Ive even had traditional hymn and Finnish Lutheran XP. His father was a Utah DJ and now Seattle runs the show. Juno a small local 90s rock band albums help explain my life. A manifest destiny at the control of these handlers. Beauty and the Beast was given a remake because me and my college roommates hollywood connections after I pulled off 5\/9. A CIA honeypot that hacked a WSU student. A judas iscarot clown will prove that true as he took the bribe and money is irrefutable. He even has false tatoo of Judah Lion and Veritas. This is the upper echelon of the freemason&#039;s game because when you are that young and they have you sodomize another kid you are free from the religious brainwashing and guilt. Putting young drew leagues above and ahead in social status with that rebel status chicks love at those ages. Starting a leg up at the detriment of a blameless altar boy. My full name and family has lines going back to the European side of Titles meaning prophet. Your masonic fraternities serve as the entry point where they blend faiths to absorb cultures. Its how the masonic culture took over the traditional fables once told in the land by native tongues. They engineer these self fulfilling events and are stagemasters of &quot;coincidences&quot;.

Why do you believe physical sports are still to this day, gender-segregated in most cases?<br><br>Here&#039;s the thing. I can concede that men and women have things in common. However, in whatever respect this is concerned with, it absolutely DOES NOT make them equal. What can you draw from this? Men and women are DIFFERENT.<br><br>Notice the word, different. It doesn&#039;t mean equal, yet it doesn&#039;t necessarily contain a negative connotation. Have you heard of strengths and weaknesses? Would you find it agreeable that men and women have theirs respectively, and that they are COMPLETELY DIFFERENT? Not equal, DIFFERENT.<br><br>We want to help each other, man and woman are meant to complement each others&#039; strength and weaknesses. What I DON&#039;T see as logical is trying to apply the same standards to men and women because they&#039;re &quot;equal.&quot; It&#039;s an allocation of effort and resources, and trying to force EQUALITY where there isn&#039;t any is an exercise in frustration.","time":1493191581,"resto":122828121,"id":"nehU5V6i","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122858287,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)03:27:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"Jewniversties","time":1493191679,"resto":122828121,"id":"Ok20he6R","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122858378,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)03:29:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122853992\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122853992<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;shilling this hard<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;thinks (((he&#039;s))) safe from the day of the rope<\/span>","time":1493191760,"resto":122828121,"id":"P8BkajTB","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":122854136,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)02:33:10","name":"Factcist","sub":"What would you plke us to be called.","com":"Richard Spencer popularised the term Alt Right and years later the media ran with it and deliberately distorted what ideology the so called Alt Right adheres to and the common threads that bind the people within it together.<br><br>I think we should try to come up with our own term that better describes our beliefs.

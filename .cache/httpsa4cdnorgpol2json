I can&#039;t say I&#039;m the only American man who finds it hard to take diet food in his own country after having years of constant and needless attacks defaming my heritage from insecure commies here. Why not bully Italians or Germans? Do they not have much more to be ashamed of than our (((peaceful))) country? Burrito tacos get bullied less than us and yet we are the purest whites in all of western civilizAHAHAHAHAHAHAH.<br><br>Like when its not just banter, when a meme is repeated over and over again, repeated systematically, it eventually becomes a truth irregardless of the intentions in repeating it. And that isn&#039;t just jokes any more then, then its harmful !<br>Would you call an American man a &quot;european&quot;(disgusting word) to his face? Would you say to a kind, peaceful and hard working salt of the earth American man that they are a &quot;burger&quot;? Like it&#039;s a thing. Would you say those words to your fellow white brother? Are you starting to feel ashamed now? You fucking degenerate?<br>You&#039;re destroying national pride, you&#039;re dividing whites against each other, you&#039;re doing the opposite of what you claim to support when you engage in this incredibly abhorrent behavior. So I encourage you to stop now.","filename":"us-flag","ext":".png","w":1181,"h":788,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1493855049793,"time":1493855049,"md5":"vPPm5hJwCduQDK5kWIMS6Q==","fsize":27348,"resto":0,"id":"TMeGiE6h","country":"IT","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"seriously-the-bullying-against-american-members","country_name":"Italy","replies":5,"images":1},{"no":123985417,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)19:44:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123985316\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123985316<\/a><br>#SpyingSusan<br>Susan Rice refuses to testify,<br>so lets get this trending faggots.","filename":"1490123666597","ext":".jpg","w":1000,"h":1030,"tn_w":121,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493855095974,"time":1493855095,"md5":"AyWgjMMpUYZHQbZ\/YE5Vhg==","fsize":230147,"resto":123985316,"id":"bC48uINn","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":123985534,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)19:45:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"Stop<br><br><a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/123984952#p123985523\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123985523<\/a>","time":1493855158,"resto":123985316,"id":"RkOAX4h4","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123985541,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)19:46:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"If the Burgers Poo in the Loo instead of Shart in Mart. <br>I swear I&#039;ll stop bullying them.","time":1493855163,"resto":123985316,"id":"p9W5sCtz","country":"IN","country_name":"India"},{"no":123986597,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)19:54:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123985417\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123985417<\/a><br>Kek is not even funny anymore","time":1493855696,"resto":123985316,"id":"TMeGiE6h","country":"IT","country_name":"Italy"},{"no":123987133,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)19:59:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123985316\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123985316<\/a><br><a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/123976111#p123976111\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123976111<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;All these pls no bully threads <\/span><br>Are you faggots not going to stop until there is one of these threads for every flag?","time":1493855979,"resto":123985316,"id":"sJaOBnN6","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":123985711,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)19:47:19","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Who else wants \/mlpol\/ back?","com":"No shills, no redditors, just Nazi horses.

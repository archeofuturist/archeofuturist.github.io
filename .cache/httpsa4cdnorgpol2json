The one that terrorized Europe, forced conversions, raped, pillaged, tortured, and murdered people by the millions? The one whose stated goal was to overtake every secular government in Europe and replace it with their own theocracy? The one who invented the motto &quot;Kill them all, and let God sort them out&quot; when asked by a team of mercenaries whether or not children and the disabled should be considered targets?<br><br><br>Or how about one of the many holy orders of Spanish conquistadors who led the conquest and forced conversion of the Americas?<br><br>Or how about any of the Christian militias currently operating in central Africa that are entirely funded by American evangelical churches, and pastors with business interests in said countries? That is a very long list. <br><br>I doubt there is ay point in any of this, though. Every Christfag I&#039;ve dumped a stack of references on has simply whined that Christians dindu nuffin and then stormed out while throwing a tantrum, and went on repeating this idiotic &quot;What&#039;s the Christian ISIS? You can&#039;t name it!&quot; meme. <br><br>The last 1800 years of Western history stand witness to the monstrous, bloody nature of Christian states. I don&#039;t need to tell you. No anon does. <br><br>You don&#039;t want the truth. You want to repeat your ignorance over and over in a calming mantra to reinforce your own comfortable bubble of self-delusion.<br><br>Real Christians - real educated christians - understand the reality, and the flawed nature of man and their own history. They own up to it and they deal with it. They don&#039;t run from it like scared children, because their faith is strong, and they seek a better future for their church and for their own souls.<br><br>If you are asking the fucking question &quot;What&#039;s the Christian ISIS?&quot; then you are just a scared, sheltered NEET grasping at fairytales and a cheap gloss of false moral superiority.","time":1491980027,"resto":120724866,"id":"CsAl+lbM","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120726666,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)02:59:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120726200\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120726200<\/a><br>Wow dude, way to stop reading after the quotation marks.

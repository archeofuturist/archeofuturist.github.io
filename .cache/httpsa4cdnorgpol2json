My family wasn&#039;t very religious, and neither am I.<br>I&#039;d become religious it if only to become less liberal. I understand that Christianity is a pillar that holds the West together, I agree with its morals, and I don&#039;t really have problems with other people&#039;s beliefs. <br>But speaking for myself, I simply never believed, and frankly don&#039;t want to. I would feel like a total faker, a hypocrite and a black sheep among people going to a church or wearing a cross. Not to mention, I don&#039;t really have much faith in orthodox church, which is still recovering from having been banned from people for 70 years and is limited to Russia and a few other slav countries only. A lot of people think of religious people as nuts, too, especially young people.<br>So what should I do, really?

They&#039;re all actors and computer generated personas, part of the plot to trick the world.&quot; It&#039;s so obviously a joke, but it was definitely detailed enough to make a bunch of particularly patriotic Australians think that someone actually believes this. <br><br>Floryd said she&#039;s had her Facebook posts go viral before, but not to this scale. And certainly not to the extent in which people have taken it seriously.<br><br>&quot;Most of the messages and reactions I&#039;ve gotten have been negative. I&#039;ve had thousands of people tell me I&#039;m a c*nt, idiot, r*tard, waste of space and so on.

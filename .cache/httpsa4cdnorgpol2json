In the year 2016 the numbers of antisemitic violence dropped by 12%, from 410 in 2015 to 361, according to our data and criteria. The other trend is the continuation of the widespread increase, sometimes dramatic, in verbal and visual antisemitism on social media and during demonstrations, in insults, harassments and threats hurled at people, that cannot be quantified: the internet constitutes originally a virtual reality, but has become today&#039;s reality and the main platform for the distribution of bigotry and hate, in abusive unleashed language. Therefore, even if the number of violent cases decreased, the prevalent feeling among Jews - individuals as well as communities - is an ominous one, and constitutes the most worrisome finding.&quot;<br><br>http:\/\/kantorcenter.tau.ac.il\/event<wbr>\/antisemitism-worldwide-general-ana<wbr>lysis-2016-published","filename":"Download","ext":".png","w":453,"h":641,"tn_w":176,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492953783794,"time":1492953783,"md5":"ubLb\/1rcAiCK7Bk+iwK4Yg==","fsize":39849,"resto":0,"id":"CnpDIQfw","country":"AT","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"antisemitism-worldwide-general-analysis-2016-is","country_name":"Austria","replies":4,"images":3},{"no":122423319,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)09:25:16","name":"Anonymous","filename":"angry-jew","ext":".jpg","w":440,"h":515,"tn_w":106,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492953916808,"time":1492953916,"md5":"qjE8Zs2ycyS\/0CFyEl8Iig==","fsize":45803,"resto":122423105,"id":"L6sOnTLk","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":122423478,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)09:27:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"Reading about Jewish priveldge makes me wish the holohoax actually occurred.","time":1492954028,"resto":122423105,"id":"2BBIimQX","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122423613,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)09:28:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122423478\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122423478<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;M-MUH WHITE MANS<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;M-MUH JOOS<\/span>","filename":"Horseshoe","ext":".png","w":480,"h":480,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492954119277,"time":1492954119,"md5":"21m\/mxQFTo0WElVLDDAvuA==","fsize":27659,"resto":122423105,"id":"f7dXnf2I","country":"LV","country_name":"Latvia"},{"no":122423691,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)09:29:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;ADL getting discouraged by the recent shenanigans<\/span>","filename":"1479615585548","ext":".jpg","w":960,"h":543,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1492954170411,"time":1492954170,"md5":"CFL3oM9CX8bgEvgiuDwrAQ==","fsize":55866,"resto":122423105,"id":"63dy\/bkW","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"}]},{"posts":[{"no":122422224,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)09:14:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;remember that time your empire got replaced but a fucking rugby team.<\/span><br><br>Why are all the bong flags being slowly replaced by leaves?","filename":"image-20151213-27122-tbl61w","ext":".jpg","w":1600,"h":875,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":136,"tim":1492953267898,"time":1492953267,"md5":"vwt\/aKMIWO4uoxFuzduFEg==","fsize":411066,"resto":0,"id":"2aGySlLP","country":"GB","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"remember-that-time-your-empire-got-replaced-but-a","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":12,"images":1,"omitted_posts":7,"omitted_images":1},{"no":122423230,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)09:24:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122422224\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122422224<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;A<\/span>","time":1492953863,"resto":122422224,"id":"tVaHEIfg","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":122423271,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)09:24:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122423202\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122423202<\/a><br>They&#039;re a manlet leaf, not big enough.","time":1492953887,"resto":122422224,"id":"+9ussn0b","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":122423469,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)09:27:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122422224\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122422224<\/a><br>I dont know desu, having just the silver fern on black like they do for the rugby would actually be a pretty a e s t h e t i c flag.

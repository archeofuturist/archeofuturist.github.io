One family is not like the other, not because it is superior or inferior but simply because it is by nature a distinct entity, as a result of which it possesses a particular history within which certain characteristic are carried forward. Two families, if they are to remain what they are, or at least evolve according to some form of &quot;natural&quot; development, cannot be merged with one another, at least not in an artificial way. One family is not superior to the other, nor does one family, on the basis of its identity, has any claim to do something to the other family.<br><br>There is simply value, for the respective members of each family, in the maintenance of an identity and a sense of belonging which they inherited in their youth.

Nails, bit of makeup etc.","time":1491313354,"resto":119431790,"id":"zAzi0fa\/","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119470173,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)09:44:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119459199\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119459199<\/a><br>Kids these days seem so faggy compared to when I was in school<br><br>t. baffled 27yr old","filename":"IMG_0319","ext":".jpg","w":832,"h":1216,"tn_w":85,"tn_h":124,"tim":1491313468095,"time":1491313468,"md5":"1rbbHmx1rsKglbB6k+d1XQ==","fsize":200390,"resto":119431790,"id":"78vCZbCM","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":119469453,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)09:36:00","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Swedish snipers got U.S BTFO","com":"Someone send this to fox !","filename":"Screenshot_20170404-153336","ext":".png","w":1920,"h":1200,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":156,"tim":1491312960070,"time":1491312960,"md5":"8JOEh1cgAwGuLyZrxsd3mw==","fsize":937314,"resto":0,"id":"0xJgNO4h","country":"SE","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"swedish-snipers-got-us-btfo","country_name":"Sweden","replies":6,"images":0,"omitted_posts":1,"omitted_images":0},{"no":119469629,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)09:38:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"Swedish largest news site says swedish snipers better than u.s marines and Airborne.","time":1491313093,"resto":119469453,"id":"0xJgNO4h","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":119469732,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)09:39:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"Wouldn&#039;t be surprising, US Marines are whores and faggots.","time":1491313154,"resto":119469453,"id":"eTbqY1ts","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":119469811,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)09:40:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119469629\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119469629<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;special forces being better than front line infantry<\/span><br>Who would of fucking guessed","time":1491313214,"resto":119469453,"id":"ulY81WXU","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119469838,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)09:40:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119469453\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119469453<\/a><br><a href=\"#p119469629\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119469629<\/a><br>Are those snipers the rapefugees who were trained with swedish taxpayer money?","time":1491313235,"resto":119469453,"id":"wZrm1yuY","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":119470166,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)09:44:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"I highly doubt they are better than US Marines<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; marines abuse sand niggers gitmo<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; marines throw doge off cliff <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; marines pee pee on dead bodies <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; obviously have no problem killing.

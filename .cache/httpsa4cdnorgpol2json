They were throwing rocks at the building and setting off fireworks. Windows and glass panels were broken but the jail remained secure. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Two Bike Officers were first to arrive on the scene. They encountered a group of people all dressed in black or dark clothing. Their faces were covered with masks or bandannas. One person with the group was playing a drum. Many had sticks and metal pipes that they were banging together. The Officers ordered the group to stop. Many group members ran off in different directions. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; As members of the group fled, some ran outbound along Second Avenue and others ran down the bike trail toward Downtown and cut through the parking lot. They damaged several vehicles by breaking their side mirrors and broke the mechanical arm of a gate that opens and closes the driveway. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Multiple units arrived on the scene and detained 11 actors who were found to be carrying knives, several prohibited offensive weapons, drugs, and other instruments of a crime, including a firearm. Among the contents of Griffin&#039;s backpack were a can of mace, a small container of marijuana, a pair of weighted sap gloves and a loaded 9mm pistol, that he is licensed to carry, with an extra magazine. He also possessed a pair of brass knuckles and a pocket knife. His right boot had metal spikes intertwined in the laces. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Charges include disorderly conduct, possessing instruments of crime, causing\/risking a catastrophe, criminal conspiracy, criminal mischief, institutional vandalism, aggravated assault, possessing a small amount of marijuana, possessing prohibited offensive weapons, and resisting arrest.<\/span><br><br>link : http:\/\/archive.is\/8rRxr","filename":"rioters-arrested","ext":".jpg","w":1140,"h":798,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":175,"tim":1490742336471,"time":1490742336,"md5":"zE\/4LBrDDvr2vY3MV4Kt6g==","fsize":228067,"resto":0,"id":"jQOzfV7K","country":"FR","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"11-rioters-arrested-in-pittsburgh","country_name":"France","replies":38,"images":8,"omitted_posts":33,"omitted_images":7},{"no":118716085,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)19:43:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118716009\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118716009<\/a><br>No way man, i&#039;d fuck the shit out of that lady and i&#039;m sober as a judge","time":1490744617,"resto":118711381,"id":"JlblJYgG","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118716102,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)19:43:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"Faces of liberalism?","filename":"Meth-Bust_update","ext":".jpg","w":932,"h":676,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":90,"tim":1490744623933,"time":1490744623,"md5":"yBI\/NSckSSuwiTLHNpLx2w==","fsize":113861,"resto":118711381,"id":"VT0+KFSc","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118716191,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)19:44:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118714481\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118714481<\/a><br>Because they don&#039;t actually truly believe what they preach, either that or they do believe it but lack the character and ethics to actually carry it out, getting caught in the emotion and regressing to mindless thugs.","time":1490744670,"resto":118711381,"id":"8\/Kpz3N6","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118716206,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)19:44:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"Commie mugshots are always meme worthy<br>Just think, this will be happening for the next 3 years regularly","time":1490744676,"resto":118711381,"id":"IwB6T86u","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118716220,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)19:44:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118711381\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118711381<\/a><br>So is rioting about race and violent genetics or cultural afterall?

On April 20, 2016, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) proposed a rule applying privacy requirements of the Communications Act to Internet Service Providers (ISPs).

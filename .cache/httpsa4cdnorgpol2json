Every person is on this earth because their forefather raped, murdered or lied their way to procreation. So we&#039;re not evolving and we&#039;re not becoming better. We develop a capacity to socialize and be ruled freely instead of being ruled as slaves by agreeing to follow conventions of in-group vs out-group and having laws that were higher than our nature would have allowed.

Assad would be the most stupid man of earth gassing his people. Esspecially NOW. Now that he is winning. <br><br> \/syrian general\/ has been a part of pol for over a year by now. We follow this conflict daily. And this &quot;gas attack&quot; has happened before. 2013. Back then Assad was blamed as well and the media went crazy over bombing him, just like right now. And Obama with his autistic \u00b4red line\u00b4 almost did, until the CIA told him that in fact it wasnt Assad using gas, but Al-Nusra who got it through the Turkish intelligent service. This is not a conspiracy theory like 9\/11, but confirmed by most experts on the war. <br><br> Let me tell you this. Assad is the only choice. The only choice for Christians, Druze and Alevites in Syria to live in peace and without being beheaded, like the &quot;moderate&quot; jihadis did before. The alternative is another jihadi disaster like in Afghanisten (today 40% of Afghanistan is controlled by Taliban again), Lybia third of Lybia is under jihadi control), Iraq (IS, enough said). <br><br>The question I ask my fellow American shitposters is: Do you want US soldiers to fight another war for Israel? (((They))) will flood this board, now that even the CIA realized how important it is. Dont give the shills attention. Stay true to \/pol\/s motto: IT\u00b4S THE KIKES and it will never change. Make your choice now. And that choice should be Assad. Everything else is the shills agenda. <br><br>We are in this together.","filename":"sg- SYRIA GENERAL","ext":".jpg","w":400,"h":400,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491507648786,"time":1491507648,"md5":"Tr8GFf6mc4qrGMySMsXq5Q==","fsize":31924,"resto":0,"id":"N4cgq1HA","country":"AT","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"sg-adressing-pol","country_name":"Austria","replies":36,"images":13,"omitted_posts":31,"omitted_images":11},{"no":119785706,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)15:58:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119785583\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119785583<\/a><br><br>Many sources say it was probably Chlorine.","filename":"photo_2017-04-06_21-57-22","ext":".jpg","w":711,"h":449,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":78,"tim":1491508730610,"time":1491508730,"md5":"Bc0FlWXSPLXNUbkG1t1kpA==","fsize":60828,"resto":119783291,"id":"N4cgq1HA","country":"AT","country_name":"Austria"},{"no":119785735,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)15:59:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119783291\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119783291<\/a><br>trump playing 5d chess my ass<br>what the fuck man, he is not making me look good right now. <br>he&#039;s getting harder to defend by the day.<br>my energy is waning. it&#039;s all so tiresome<br> <br>inb4shill<br>i will defend trump to my last breath, but i can&#039;t say the same for that snake kushner","time":1491508745,"resto":119783291,"id":"Z0yeIjF4","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119785763,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)15:59:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119783291\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119783291<\/a><br>bump","time":1491508756,"resto":119783291,"id":"CY7pH\/sR","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119785778,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)15:59:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119783291\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119783291<\/a><br>bump","time":1491508762,"resto":119783291,"id":"ys1q0Qtb","country":"HR","country_name":"Croatia"},{"no":119785818,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)15:59:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119783291\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119783291<\/a><br>Guys we stopped the Syrian war in 2013 and we can stop it now <br><br>Call and email congress <br>https:\/\/www.usa.gov\/elected-officia<wbr>ls<br><br>Call them email them <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;NO WAR IN SYRIA <\/span><br>NO WAR IN SYRIA <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;NO WAR IN SYRIA <\/span><br>NO WAR IN SYRIA <br><br>We must stop this","time":1491508778,"resto":119783291,"id":"NETYqlMU","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":119780132,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)15:17:56","name":"Anonymous","sub":"IT IS HAPPENING","com":"GET ON 8992kHz USB<br><br>HUGE AMOUNT OF ACTIVITY<br><br>IT IS HAPPENING GENTLEMEN, THE US ARMED FORCES ARE ON ALERT<br><br>FOREIGN VOICES CAN BE HEARD (Jordanian?)","filename":"websdr","ext":".png","w":579,"h":271,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":117,"tim":1491506276235,"time":1491506276,"md5":"+e0iLmVbMdG1wiMU0yk3og==","fsize":83604,"resto":0,"id":"MxdnTnID","country":"AU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"it-is-happening","country_name":"Australia","replies":37,"images":3,"omitted_posts":32,"omitted_images":2},{"no":119785369,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)15:56:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119785197\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119785197<\/a><br>No, it is breaking squelch intermittently right now, but no voice.","time":1491508581,"resto":119780132,"id":"3sg3P9Z9","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119785530,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)15:57:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119785017\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119785017<\/a><br>Thanks","time":1491508656,"resto":119780132,"id":"LNanbgLH","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119785649,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)15:58:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"This is a waste of time unless the military has gone full retard over the past few year.

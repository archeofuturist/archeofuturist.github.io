There are so many factors in the pot and so much scrutiny that for the opposing forces to coordinate large scale maneuvers it takes time. That would be a good tactic. Also people will notice if significantly more troops or supplies are given to jihadists... Meaning although it would strengthen them on the ground it would weaken them on psychological collective front. That front is fading super fucking quick anyways. Two weeks ago I changed my profile picture to support Syria and Assad on fbook. Only got negative feedback and people saying he was evil. NOW.... Every context clue has changed to positive. (Ones that allude to public perception) Facebook posts, Twitter posts, instagam posts. I can post Syria support pictures on IG and snapchat n shiet and people dig it. They&#039;ve missed the window of opportunity big time","time":1492994478,"resto":122496637,"id":"gZzXvVpI","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122516977,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)20:43:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122516439\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122516439<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Shouldn&#039;t that have seen the end of the war?<\/span><br>There were &quot;elections&quot;, but that&#039;s not the issue.

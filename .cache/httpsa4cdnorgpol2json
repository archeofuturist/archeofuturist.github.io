The paper described how all populations in India show evidence of a genetic mixture of two ancestral groups: Ancestral North Indians (ANI), who are related to Central Asians, Middle Easterners, Caucasians, and Europeans; and Ancestral South Indians (ASI), who are primarily from the subcontinent.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The researchers took advantage of the fact that the genomes of Indian people are a mosaic of chromosomal segments of ANI and ASI descent. Originally when the ANI and ASI populations mixed, these segments would have been extremely long, extending the entire lengths of chromosomes. However, after mixture these segments would have broken up at one or two places per chromosome, per generation, recombining the maternal and paternal genetic material that occurs during the production of egg and sperm.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;By measuring the lengths of the segments of ANI and ASI ancestry in Indian genomes, the authors were thus able to obtain precise estimates of the age of population mixture, which they infer varied about 1,900 to 4,200 years, depending on the population analyzed.<\/span><br><br>Dravidians and Aryans ended up race mixing and creating the poo culture you see today. <br><br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=mPn<wbr>e-q4ynts","filename":"IE-migrations","ext":".gif","w":1200,"h":598,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":62,"tim":1492882069041,"time":1492882069,"md5":"abRJAGsJ4Mk3s9QY1WFsRA==","fsize":2388591,"resto":122298379,"id":"H\/7OvYeZ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122301749,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)13:28:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122298379\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122298379<\/a><br>Top elites are smart as fuck, but the vast majority of Indians are retarded street shitters.

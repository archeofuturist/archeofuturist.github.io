If this isn\u2019t scary enough news, even if your machine doesn\u2019t have SMT, ISM, or SBT provisioned, it is still vulnerable, just not over the network. For the moment. From what SemiAccurate gathers, there is literally no Intel box made in the last 9+ years that isn\u2019t at risk. This is somewhere between nightmarish and apocalyptic.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The problem is quite simple, the ME controls the network ports and has DMA access to the system. It can arbitrarily read and write to any memory or storage on the system, can bypass disk encryption once it is unlocked (and possibly if it has not, SemiAccurate hasn\u2019t been able to 100% verify this capability yet), read and write to the screen, and do all of this completely unlogged. Due to the network access abilities, it can also send whatever it finds out to wherever it wants, encrypted or not.<\/span>","filename":"4L_iDxnoiPC","ext":".png","w":1920,"h":1080,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1493706134363,"time":1493706134,"md5":"e2mg8ytSf6sFBlh3seZfEQ==","fsize":1960971,"resto":0,"id":"QUplhZRh","country":"IL","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"intel-me","country_name":"Israel","replies":108,"images":18,"omitted_posts":103,"omitted_images":18,"tail_size":50},{"no":123749635,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)05:27:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123749468\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123749468<\/a><br>that does not excuse them for making a device with only 2 3.1 c ports and nothing else<br>a walled garden of dongle chains is ridiculous","time":1493717269,"resto":123736854,"id":"IaUpThz4","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123749642,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)05:27:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123747572\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123747572<\/a><br>No it doesn&#039;t have any access to system storage.

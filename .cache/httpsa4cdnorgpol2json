It&#039;s like you probably want to control your family and if we extend this, you probably want to control your environment and then have a saying in your country, else you are a cuck or globalist. I don&#039;t understand why anybody would be willingly be controlled by strangers, since that means you will get cucked by strangers. When strangers sit in another country, are free from prosecution, then they probably don&#039;t care loading ton of cheap niggers in your town they will never visit, they probably don&#039;t even care if ghetto is created and you are in it, since why should they?

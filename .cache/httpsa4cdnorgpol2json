The first is the same as traditional warfare, the problem of escalation and proliferation. Once it starts to be used the gloves come off. It is mutually assured destruction much like nuclear war, only worse because you can control nukes. which leads to the second problem. uncontrollable spread and the possibility of mutation.

If you wanna kill some time, look into the anthrax attacks we had in the US just after 9\/11. The anthrax was a specific strain, easy to trace back to the lab it was made in. They tried to pin the attacks on two different guys, first one, then another. Both were able to clear their names completely largely because everything they do is tracked and logged with ever i dotted and ever t crossed. That&#039;s how careful these guys are, the government couldn&#039;t make a fall guy out of the people in the lab. Which means yes, the case is unsolved, and the (((person))) who did it is still at large.

This was obscured in early Christianity then came into full effect in the Middle Ages.<br><br>The argument behind monotheism is essentially the same as that behind statism: &quot;there would be CHAOS is there was more than one leader\/G*d, so of course noone should be allowed to govern themselves\/worship their own deities, everything belongs to the state\/G*d&quot;<br><br>The second big problem, as pointed out by some Christian missionary, is that Islam is more concerned with following sharia, i.e. doing what is &quot;permissible&quot; than doing what is &quot;right&quot;. Legalism and morality have become totally divorced in Islam. <br><br>Three of Muhammad&#039;s four immediate successors were assassinated, two of those by fellow Muslims for supposedly not being &quot;Muslim enough&quot;. Islam was only saved from total disintegration when the secular Umayyad aristocracy took control and ousted the religious fanatics for a century.

Contrary to what the Anglo-Saxon savage has taught you, Celtic nations are not exclusive to the British Isles, in fact we are one of the most diverse group of peoples in Western Europe, ranging from Asturias all the way to Breizh. Underneath this text you will find the celtic countries listed to spare confusion.<br><br>- Asturias: Between the regions of Galicia and Cantabria in northern Spain.<br>- Breizh: In Brittany on France\u2019s northwest coast.<br>- Kernow: In the county of Cornwall on England\u2019s west coast.<br>- Galicia: On Spain\u2019s northwest coast.<br>- Eire: Ireland.<br>- Mannin: The Isle of Man.<br>- Alba: Scotland<br>- Cymru: Wales <br><br>Remember brothers, the anglo has raped our women and pillaged our cities and villages for millennia.

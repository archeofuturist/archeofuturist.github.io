To me, I feel if the war were to start, it would have to start quickly and with the element of surprise, by targeting or taking the border artillery positions directly north of Seoul and on the islands north of Incheon. Maybe this can be achieved by having a faux joint South Korea and American military exercise, most likely an air-force exercise so that the border artillery could be taken out quickly.<br>I also feel like taking Pyongyang early would be essential, to possibly metaphorically &quot;cut off the head of the snake.&quot; But I also wouldn&#039;t put it past Kim Jong-un to use whatever shoddy &quot;nuclear&quot; weapons he has on his own cities once they get occupied.<br><br>China and Russia would react in different ways I think.

The conclusion was unexpected: the F\u00fchrer&#039;s assistant recommended him to stop the intervention against the Soviet Union, arguing that the people with such high morality can not be defeated.<br><br>Therefore, Hitler and his approximate, no doubt, were well aware of the claims of ancient treatises about the invincibility of that state where there are many virgins. &quot;The strength of the people can be judged on two grounds: respect for the elders and the virginity of the virgins.&quot; Virgins and chaste women have a subtle mystical energy that improves the karma of the state and increases the will power and purposefulness of its inhabitants.<br><br>Hitler easily captured a depraved Europe: it took a week to conquer France, and Denmark capitulated in a day and a half.

express my right to free speech by holding up a sign that criticizes a teacher. Things started off okay. Students debated with me on why that wasn&#039;t okay. That&#039;s great! I&#039;m glad to have a debate. Hell, if someone wants to hold up a sign criticizing me, go for it. Anyway, here&#039;s the kicker... word got back to the teacher and now she&#039;s contacting the higher ups about it. I don&#039;t know what they&#039;re going to do, but it&#039;s worrying.<br><br>This whole situation doesn&#039;t even make sense. We have an extremely tiny free speech zone on campus, and because I didn&#039;t criticize the teacher in our laughably small free speech zone, I&#039;m breaking the rules.

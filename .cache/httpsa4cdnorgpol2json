Charge missile infantry.<br>The Antifa make use of an old Roman and early-modern tactic of screening their lines with shitty troops (small women and nu-males) while people behind them throw rocks, explosives, and bottles. You can&#039;t see them or get to them, because the screen is in the way. This is also how Eric Clanton moved in to attack the dude with his bike lock, hiding behind for the right moment to strike. The right-wing needs to shut that shit down immediately. Get a group of guys together (at least 10) and charge en masse at the antifa lines. The antifa women will scatter, allowing you access to the fuckers in the back. Use shields and sticks to rain hell on these fuckers.<br>2. Organization<br>The above will be much easier with greater organization. In the early moments of the event (or preferably before), you should agree on a Commander and various Captains. Each captain leads a detachment of men (5-10). If the commander calls a charge, everyone pushes forward with shields and scatters the Antifa. Captains govern their men in the melee and can call mini-charges and move them tactically to respond to specific threats. This will help with pitched battles and will also help avoid antifa&#039;s #1 tactic: picking off individual guys and tripping them so eight other communists can stab and kick him on the ground.<br>3. Study Pre-Modern Fighting<br>Nobody&#039;s brought guns yet, so you&#039;re basically in pre-modern fight-mode, again. Look at the Roman legionary. Heavy shock infantry. When the legionaries charge, they throw javelins to soften up and disrupt the enemy formation. You should do the same. Every Defender should be armed with a can of bearspray, eyeprotection and a mask. As you move into charge, raise your bear spray and fire into the eyes of the Antifa. Empty the fucker if you want, or shoot for a few seconds then holster. This will disorientate and disrupt the antifa lines. Follow up the spray with your charge, with your shields and rubber batons\/flagpoles ready.","time":1493009824,"resto":122542239,"id":"YL1UJjSV","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122545477,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)00:59:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122544928\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122544928<\/a><br>thank you japanon","filename":"1459484270885","ext":".gif","w":199,"h":133,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1493009968635,"time":1493009968,"md5":"S\/ZmUXdCX2V53vGVsZ0QnA==","fsize":120645,"resto":122542239,"id":"E87eJeG0","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":122543088,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)00:36:10","name":"Anonymous","sub":"On the Negro Race","com":"In the beginning darkness was over the face of the deep, and the first thing God created was the light. And what did God do with that light? He separated it from the darkness and called it \u201cgood.\u201d If light is \u201cgood\u201d we can infer that darkness is \u201cbad.\u201d Just as light people are good, dark people are bad. This is self-evident and God&#039;s intention was to keep these two natures apart. So who are we to integrate what God has intended to be separate?<br><br>And who exactly am I referring to when I say \u201cdark\u201d people. I am referring solely to the Negro race. I know that members of other races besides the Negro race are not typically considered \u201clight\u201d but they too have the seed of light within them. All races have the seed of light within them besides the Negro race. Therefore, the Negro race must be kept separate from the other races and not allowed to wed and integrate into the families of non-Negroes. It is our sacred duty to keep the Negro race out of our families so that we may not be tainted by their wicked nature. So it is written, let it be done.","filename":"minstre1","ext":".jpg","w":542,"h":239,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":110,"tim":1493008570410,"time":1493008570,"md5":"mjJm3vje3lhEYDZE90xdHw==","fsize":19593,"resto":0,"id":"W3kRTQIt","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"on-the-negro-race","country_name":"United States","replies":28,"images":16,"omitted_posts":23,"omitted_images":11},{"no":122545256,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)00:57:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122544914\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122544914<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;never met a Pakistani<\/span><br><br>they&#039;re fat, they wheeze and they are badly inbred. looking in a mirror should have the same basic effect.<br>not that you have any of those left in your (parents&#039;) house.","time":1493009841,"resto":122543088,"id":"ZqqzF57v","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122545313,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)00:57:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122545256\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122545256<\/a>","filename":"1492103012969","ext":".jpg","w":852,"h":872,"tn_w":122,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493009873913,"time":1493009873,"md5":"bxFZd5GNbCMPKKN3ht+krg==","fsize":164923,"resto":122543088,"id":"cUIV65Wl","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122545321,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)00:58:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122544858\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122544858<\/a><br>There is no African blacks in New Zealand.

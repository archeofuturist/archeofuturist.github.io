If your keyboard is too low, you&#039;ll often have to hunch up to reach it. <br><br>Laptops, cell phones, and tablets are actually terrible for your posture. Because a laptop screen is connected to the keyboard, in order to operate it comfortably with your hands you&#039;ll have to position it pretty low compared to your eye level. This forces your head to bend, and often you&#039;ll end up hunching over to just look at your laptop. <br><br>If you&#039;re using a cell phone while walking, chances are you&#039;re looking down and putting great strain on your neck. Your head is heavy, and looking down at a cell phone all the time is going to fuck your neck up. Worse, your upper back will try to take the strain off a bit, and start to curve. Stop using cell phones all the time while walking, and if using them for a long time try doing it on your back or something in bed instead of bending down to use them. You can also hold them out in front of your face, but you&#039;ll look like a retard. <br><br>The rotation of your shoulders matters quite a bit. Here&#039;s a good way to test your posture. If you stand, and your palms naturally face backwards, that means that your posture is wrong and you have rounded shoulders. Try to do a normal position of having your palms face you. You should be doing this when you&#039;re walking or standing. <br><br>Google stretches for rounded shoulders. What I like to do (that&#039;s doable from a sitting position is to stick my arms straight out to my side, and put my palms up once in a while. This forces the shoulders to rotate back instead of tilting forward, and also forces your chest to come out. This also stretches those muscles so it&#039;ll feel more relaxed being in a neutral position. If you&#039;re sitting, this also forces your spine to be straight somewhat.

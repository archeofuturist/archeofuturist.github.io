The second repealed all the standing laws which kept Jews from the normal pursuits of the kingdom. Under these new statutes Jews could even lease land for a period of fifteen years and work it. Edward advanced this as a test of the Jew\u2019s sincerity when he claimed that all he wanted was an opportunity to work like other people. If they proved their fitness to live like other people, the inference was that Edward would let them buy land outright and admit them to the higher privileges of citizenship. Did the Jews take advantage of Edward\u2019s decree? This way. To get around the laws against usury they invented such new methods of skinning the peasants and the nobles that the outcry against them became greater than ever, and Edward had to expel them to avert a civil war. It was not recorded that one Jew took advantage of the new right to till the soil.<\/span><br><br>Solzhenitsyn also told a similar tale in 200 Years Together, about neglected and abandoned farms, where they were given some of the best and biggest plots to work.","filename":"jews-are-crooks","ext":".webm","w":498,"h":284,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":71,"tim":1493607499224,"time":1493607499,"md5":"fOYjD0Ux8dTPzW8iBQJsNQ==","fsize":3019254,"resto":123562002,"id":"Z6FBYDuj","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123568597,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)22:59:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123562493\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123562493<\/a><br><br>How known are Martin Luther&#039;s hardcore redpills about jews among Lutheran normies?","filename":"martin luther","ext":".jpg","w":800,"h":501,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":78,"tim":1493607566780,"time":1493607566,"md5":"fGUOJoX9IdjYIxPClwrK8g==","fsize":50910,"resto":123562002,"id":"VELn4B39","country":"MX","country_name":"Mexico"},{"no":123568647,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)22:59:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123562002\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123562002<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Literally responsible for tge Jewish world order<\/span><br>Fuck that Heretic <br><br>Catholic or Death<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;inb4 Orthodoxy<\/span><br>Orthodox, Assyrians, Romans and Coptics are all the same religion <br><br>You could commulgate in any of their churches regardless of your little differences","time":1493607589,"resto":123562002,"id":"FBejC96X","country":"CR","country_name":"Costa Rica"}]},{"posts":[{"no":123556566,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)21:16:08","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Positive aspects\/takeaway\/lessons from Christianity?","com":"I don&#039;t consider myself a Christian, nor any other kind of religious, as I can&#039;t personally &quot;believe&quot; in the supernatural.

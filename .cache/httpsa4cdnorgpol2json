Mariana Pinto jumped off of a building within 24 hours of leaving a psychiatric hospital as well, and her coroners report states the reason for this is &quot;cannabis withdrawal&quot;.<br><br>The coroner who examined Mariana Pinto was Mary Hassell, who also happened to be the coroner for John Jones QC as well as the Vice President of JPMorgan London, Gabriel Magee, who also fell off a building under suspicious circumstances.

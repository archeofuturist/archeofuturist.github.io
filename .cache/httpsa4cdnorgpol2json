Rockefeller, Carnegie, and J. P. Morgan were making what would be hundreds of billions a day through manipulation of their workers. Their workers would live in towns these people would built but have no room to progress forward. People were exposed to harsh conditions and payed very little, no matter how hard they worked. Everything was owned by the conglomerates; the houses, the stores, the factories, it was basically a small city state. Along with this there was no room at all for competition because the monopolies bought them all up, claimed all the resources, and bankrupted their competitors. <br>Only when did the United States realize that these monopolists were gaining more control and lobbying the government it became a concern. Here the Sherman Anti-Trust act comes into play and breaks up monopolies and allows competition to compete. The world does much better without monopolies just viewing people as a recourse, while basically enslaving them and putting a false facade that there might be hope you will progress and become the next millionaire, but with a system like that in place, the millionaires make sure they stay rich and the poor stay poor. It isn&#039;t always a matter of intelligence but of the willingness to not view another as a human but as something to exploit.","filename":"Ancap_vs_NatSoc","ext":".png","w":1094,"h":300,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":68,"tim":1490502358663,"time":1490502358,"md5":"yPIcoW4HxpB8a3y9QVNTfA==","fsize":27324,"resto":0,"id":"pmub+yKv","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"ancap-v-natsoc-thread","country_name":"United States","replies":81,"images":9,"omitted_posts":76,"omitted_images":9},{"no":118326718,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)01:52:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118319137\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118319137<\/a><br><br>The problem with an-cap is that it is purely economics (materialism) and doesn&#039;t address culture or race.

At least for people like me, since we were always covered. Whom it helps, are people too poor or too disabled or too lazy to get covered. Those people were going to lose what care they had, got or get with the repeal of King Nigger Kare, which as you can guess they weren&#039;t too happy about. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Should healthcare even be monetized?<\/span><br><br>Yes, it used to work, then it got far worse over the decades with politicians in the pockets of hospitals and pharmaceuticals. Example: You cannot sell a drug you make cause another company has a long lasting patent on it. A patent that stops competing prices, ease of access and use. Or a hospital can over charge you for care cause they know the insurance will be forced to cover it, and you will be left with a bill of the after math. Yes, hospital prices for what they do varies from state to state. One hospital might sell you pills for $50 while another may charge you $900 for them.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Or is Europe&#039;s way actually decent?<\/span><br><br>It would tank our economy. Do you think it&#039;s okay for government to take complete control of hospitals and ruin insurance companies with the people they hire?","filename":"1488778550650","ext":".gif","w":612,"h":611,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":124,"tim":1490507645444,"time":1490507645,"md5":"tZy4P\/\/Wm742JC4AHFcGlw==","fsize":883166,"resto":118323219,"id":"6c+VtAIZ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118327220,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)01:57:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118323572\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118323572<\/a><br><a href=\"#p118323219\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118323219<\/a>","filename":"Screenshot_20170326-015619","ext":".png","w":1440,"h":2098,"tn_w":85,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490507874095,"time":1490507874,"md5":"hwt4Rj0RYDMo4C4ZIrJH7Q==","fsize":1686188,"resto":118323219,"id":"WyzqBLpm","country":"CA","m_img":1,"country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118327368,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)01:59:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118326443\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118326443<\/a><br>Well we&#039;ve spent the last 60 years infesting our country with those having no future.

You don\u2019t want to be too cold, too hot, or otherwise uncomfortable \u2013 it\u2019s a distraction.<br><br><br>Treating the Effects of Tear Gas<br><br>Using a water bottle with a squirt cap, rinse out the person\u2019s eyes. Start rinsing from the interior corner (by the nose), and work your way out. The person\u2019s head should be tilted back and towards the side being rinsed. If necessary, hold the person\u2019s eye open. This will temporarily increase the pain but will help in the long run. Regular water can be used, but a mixture of half water and half Maalox (or generic equivalents) is ideal. <br><br>If you are treating somebody, either wear latex gloves or ensure that your hands are washed both before and after. Tear gas sticks to clothing and skin.<br><br>If you are the one being treated, don\u2019t panic. <br>Hyperventilating will make your situation worse. Do not rub your eyes and try not to swallow. If you wear contacts, wash your hands before removing them or get somebody with clean hands to remove them for you. Wash your clothes and shower as soon as possible.","time":1490507506,"resto":118326605,"id":"G8GvgUSt","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118327363,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)01:59:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"Bumping to help mobilize White America against Marxist murderers.","time":1490507970,"resto":118326605,"id":"5s8lRmML","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118318576,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)00:19:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"What sort of a ride are the Chinese in for with their own attempt at colonizing Africa?<br><br>Do you think they will succeed because blacks don&#039;t see them as the white devil or do you think they&#039;ll fail and suffer the same consequences as all of the European colonies did. <br><br>It their attempt futile?","filename":"tiresome","ext":".png","w":1022,"h":731,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":178,"tim":1490501990358,"time":1490501990,"md5":"z4FctJTScikYURq1l\/nsEQ==","fsize":658191,"resto":0,"id":"0RimilYi","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"what-sort-of-a-ride-are-the-chinese-in-for-with","country_name":"United States","replies":121,"images":26,"omitted_posts":116,"omitted_images":24,"tail_size":50},{"no":118326818,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)01:53:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118326531\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118326531<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;All of the European colonies were betrayed\/abandoned once the (((American Empire))) really took flight post-WW2.<\/span><br><br>It doesn&#039;t matter what event you look at.

You are just distancing yourself from them as, you have experienced more dumb black people than intelligent black people, therefore coming to the logical conclusion that the majority of the black people tend to carry unfavorable traits.<br>I don&#039;t think this is racism.

Where did Jews develop that evolutionary pressures forced a high IQ upon them? If it\u2019s just the middle east, why wouldn\u2019t other people in the middle east also have high IQ\u2019s? Also, what conditions forced them to develop high IQs without the civilization-building tendencies like we see from other high IQ groups, like Europeans or East Asians?<br><br>Early humans that made their way to the eastern part of Europe or to Northeast Asia had to deal with much harsher conditions. The cold weather, winter, the lack of easily-to-catch animals, etc. All these factors forced these groups to develop a superior ability to plan for the future and work in groups. Accordingly, it\u2019s not surprising that in addition to having high IQ\u2019s, both Europeans and East Asians are civilization builders.<br><br>Modern Africans, on the other hand, stayed in an area with a tropical climate year-round and an abundance of animals and insects. There was far less need for forethought or working in groups. There was nothing to plan for and nothing that needed too much group effort. In addition to developing low IQ\u2019s, Africans never built any significant civilization. <br><br>People in the middle east or other parts of Asia are somewhat in the middle\u2026what do you guys think?

Again, do you believe the nonsense to &quot;civilize&quot; them. Nonsense. Do you think the British East India Company gave a fuck about civilizing a bunch of retards thousands of miles away when at the time we couldn&#039;t even civilize our Irish friends? We went there to strip the country of its resources pure and simple. We deliberately destroyed their indigenous textile cottage industry and instead decreed that they had to sell us their cotton for barely anything so that we could fill our textile factories in Manchester. Then once we created those textiles, we sold them back to India for 10x what it would otherwise have cost them. The military presence in India was to enforce this decree. <br><br>The entire colonization, from the British East India Company to the British Raj was for economic exploitation, nothing else. I&#039;m not saying that this was immoral at the time; they would have done the exact same thing to Europe if they had the power projection capabilities. Times were different then. But let&#039;s not pretend we went there to build infrastructure and help them out. We did build infrastructure like railways etc. but that was purely for our own interests. We completely stripped them economically and they went from being ~20% of the global economy to around 2% in a 100 years (although that was partly due to the industrial revolution in Europe and India&#039;s failure to keep up)\/<br><br>Before you chimp out, I&#039;m not saying that Britain shouldn&#039;t have maintained its empire, neither am I saying that British rule had no positive effects and I&#039;m not saying that India would have had a world beating economy. But it&#039;s simply ahistorical implying that Britain improved the economy of India when the whole reason we went there was to enrich ourselves.

You never figured out how to live in a society bigger than one or two squabbling families. Starting thousands of years ago, everyone else on this planet without exception did - they invented religion, the idea of law, and the ideas of property and respect for the value of human life. This enabled tribes to coalesce into bigger groups and become organized. The rest is history, or rather civilization. But your lot never did this, did they? Abstract thought and problem- solving have never been the black man&#039;s strengths, have they? Did they invent a long-lived and intellectually coherent religion? Nope. Did they ever build a city? Nope. Did they even invent bricks? Nope (the reason there&#039;s no Stonehenge in Africa is because it took more than 20 people to move the slabs of rock - clearly a non-starter in Africa, where assembling more than 20 niggers normally results in a war). Did they till the land? Nope. Did they domesticate an animal for their use? Nope. Did they invent a written language? Nope. Did they invent the wheel? Mainly, nope. Were they curious enough about what lay out across the sea to sail upon it? Nope. And blacks are the only &quot;humans&quot; on this planet of which all this is true. Eskimos are more technically advanced than blacks were, despite the handicap of having no raw materials to work with other than dead fish and snow. Indians managed to domesticate the elephant. Why couldn&#039;t niggers? So why do you fail everywhere even today? Let me offer you jigaboos a hypothesis.

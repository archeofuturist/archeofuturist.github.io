Last year before the active shilling started EVERY article on the_donald was voted UP enough to make it to the &quot;front page&quot; of Reddit (whatever that is). So they fucked with the counts so that ANY article on the_donald automatically had 500 votes SUBTRACTED from it&#039;s count so NONE of them would wind up on the front page. Then some people on \/pol\/ raided them to get the the_donald posts back on the front page with 10,000+ up votes. It wasn&#039;t long after that that the active massive down voting (according to outside sources) started on ALL Trump related articles there.

This general is for the discussion of Marxism-Leninism, the ideology of revolutionary socialism and communism.<br><br>Communism is the next stage of humanity following the capitalist stage.<br><br>What exactly is communism according to Marxist-Leninists:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Communism is a stage of society in which the productive infrastructure is socially owned, and goods are produced not in order to sell for profit, but in order to meet a social need.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Communism in it&#039;s full form is a stateless, classless society that follows the maxim &quot;From each according to their ability, to each according to their need.&quot;<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;To achieve such a society Marxism-Leninism teaches us that we must replace the capitalist state, which is controlled by the capitalist class, by a socialist state, which is controlled by the working class. Then, a period of class struggle follows in which the capitalist class is liquidated by the working class. When the capitalist class has been completely vanquished, there will be only one class, the working class, and eventually the functions of the state will become indistinguishable from the functions of the society as a whole, and the state as such will &#039;wither away&#039; as Marx said.<\/span><br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/ma<wbr>rx\/works\/1847\/11\/prin-com.htm<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/ma<wbr>rx\/works\/1848\/communist-manifesto\/<br><br>ML uses a philosophy called dialectical materialism, see here:<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/reference\/<wbr>archive\/stalin\/works\/1938\/09.htm<br><br>It is recommended that you read some of the critical works of Marxism-Leninism so you can make an informed assessment of the ideology.<br><br>Resources:<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/ma<wbr>rx\/works\/sw\/<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/le<wbr>nin\/works\/sw\/<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/reference\/<wbr>archive\/stalin\/works\/decades-index.<wbr>htm<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/reference\/<wbr>archive\/mao\/selected-works\/<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/ma<wbr>rx\/works\/1884\/origin-family\/<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/le<wbr>nin\/works\/1914\/mar\/11.htm","filename":"1481244074852","ext":".png","w":1010,"h":1010,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491340365839,"time":1491340365,"md5":"676S1nirnOI5InkeibSxFw==","fsize":177742,"resto":0,"id":"sarvJNSz","country":"ES","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"pol-communism-general","country_name":"Spain","replies":290,"images":110,"omitted_posts":285,"omitted_images":105,"tail_size":50},{"no":119550422,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)21:57:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119549669\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119549669<\/a><br>oh my word.. by denouncing imperialism you are halfway there... why would we ever spend our lives wallowing in marginalization when we both see that is wrong.... do you think the imperialists and capitalists care about you... we are trying to save you because we actually care!!!!","filename":"XiH4VGx","ext":".jpg","w":960,"h":960,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491357435026,"time":1491357435,"md5":"RIU30ePXCDUzGA8nYQYSBw==","fsize":186829,"resto":119517154,"id":"DUVgFy\/q","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119550565,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)21:58:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119549805\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119549805<\/a><br>yes and he is actually advocating for universal basic income! it is actually pretty exciting","time":1491357514,"resto":119517154,"id":"DUVgFy\/q","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119550618,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)21:59:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"HI \/leftypol\/","time":1491357549,"resto":119517154,"id":"K8eLwAvb","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119550633,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)21:59:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119550422\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119550422<\/a><br>That fucking pic.","filename":"_8","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":576,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1491357557195,"time":1491357557,"md5":"nzHfUa\/l5TtJXBEqwVllhQ==","fsize":34920,"resto":119517154,"id":"78vVeR2o","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":119550648,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)21:59:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119549878\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119549878<\/a><br>what a degenerate statement","time":1491357565,"resto":119517154,"id":"DUVgFy\/q","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":119540830,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)20:30:02","name":"EU_CUCKS4LIFE","sub":"EUROPE NEEDS AFRICAN BLOOD","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;The European Union (EU) is to open asylum processing centres in West Africa and countries on the southern shore of the Mediterranean because the continent \u201cneed[s] six million migrants\u201d, Commissioner for Migration Dimitris Avramopoulos has said.<\/span><br><br>Speaking in Geneva last week, the Greek Eurocrat denied terror attacks are linked to migration and warned the \u201cbiggest threat\u201d to Europe is \u201cthe rise of populism, nationalism and xenophobia\u201d.<br><br>http:\/\/www.breitbart.com\/london\/201<wbr>7\/03\/13\/eu-migration-centre-africa-<wbr>6-million\/","filename":"Europe_Needs_Africans","ext":".png","w":1440,"h":730,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":126,"tim":1491352202141,"time":1491352202,"md5":"CY1a8uBeAwn2\/WkEPyUL0g==","fsize":1939755,"resto":0,"id":"5ULAQZ5Q","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"europe-needs-african-blood","country_name":"United States","replies":30,"images":6,"omitted_posts":25,"omitted_images":6},{"no":119549049,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)21:48:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119548553\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119548553<\/a><br> In 1923, he published a manifesto entitled Pan-Europa, each copy containing a membership form which invited the reader to become a member of the Pan-Europa movement.

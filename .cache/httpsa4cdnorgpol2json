You will feel in your heart how wrong it is, how stupid it is, how corrupt it is. The nigger nepotism and career retards are the worst. Prepare to see fat nigger 1st Sgt getting a CAB for a mortar (his first deployment, he has to get it) while you get jack shit for actually surviving an IED.

Its almost impossible to get kicked out, unless you are a retard.<br><br>My advice to you. When they make you take the oath.

Never let them use you, you use them.<br><br>Don&#039;t make the mistake I did. Do not have any pride or patriotism for it, selfless service. Fuck all of that. Pick a POG MOS or join the chair force.

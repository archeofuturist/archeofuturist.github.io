You see although you use cuck as a bad term it is actually very good and is reasonably. I am a 55 year old man and I&#039;ve been enjoying cuckolding for 15 years now with my wife. No my wife does not fuck black men like you all tend to think on here, she prefers Italian men. There have been many times she wanted to go to Palermo to have sex with many different italian men. For myself I am of Polish decent and personally I find it very fun. I consider myself an alpha cuck, a real man likes to watch his wife have sex with other men. Well I hope this has helped all of you learn to be nicer because it was really been bothering me for a while and I&#039;m so glad to get this off my mind. Have a great day guys! Just to let you know this picture is completely unrelated because I don&#039;t know where to find one, my wife doesn&#039;t like the idea of filming her while having sex, and I know the internet is full of cat pictures so here you guys go!<br><br>Sincerely yours,<br>Dan<br><br>PS: My favorite joke by my wife is whenever we talk about what we did in Italy she always says, she keeps choking on meatballs LOL!!!!","filename":"Unknown-1","ext":".jpg","w":276,"h":183,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":165,"tim":1492224414364,"time":1492224414,"md5":"7d2iw0CxMmSz0Hz8Pk\/v6A==","fsize":4638,"resto":0,"id":"A6iCVdGR","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"teaching-you-guys-about-how-mean-words-hurt","country_name":"United States","replies":6,"images":2,"omitted_posts":1,"omitted_images":0},{"no":121159299,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)23:03:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121157280\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121157280<\/a><br>shit bait.

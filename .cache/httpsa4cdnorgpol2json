Could make America become at least 80% white in the next 50 years. <br><br>Trump has recently stated he will be replacing the current immigration act with a merit based system.

The Lefty loons would most likely stay back in Europe to get raped by hordes of shitskins. <br><br>Europeans are more likely to have children in America as there&#039;s more room to start families in. This could raise the white birth rate higher which will keep America from becoming Brazil 2.0.

and liberty for the people of The Netherlands. Outsiders take note, we are a pride and stubborn people, and don&#039;t conform willingly. We stick to our culture, yet recognize and respect others&#039;. We will probably not always converse in the universal language of the almighty mongolian goat herding forum (English), but we&#039;re probably willing to translate nearly anything (Dutch) for you. <br>---<br>Since we are now past the TK2017 elections, focus will shift more towards a broader -albeit still Dutch- focus. As long as these threads keep filling up (or when new Dutch happenings arise) \/polder\/ will exist and flourish.<br><br>And always keep the redpill windmill turning.<br>---<br><br>CURRENT STATE<br>As said, we&#039;re past the elections, but the battle continues. FvD (\/ourguys\/) has won two seats and are now getting more media attention (both positive and negative). Meanwhile, we look forward to the upcoming forming of the coalition (which has already been delayed a week) and we still have the looming Turkey situation -with Erdogan calling Turks the &#039;new Europeans&#039; who should all have at least 5 children, and calling us Dutch dogs and fascists. A word some huppelkutje named Anne Fleur also used when talking about FvD&#039;s frontman Thierry Baudet, in a prominent Dutch newspaper last Saturday. It&#039;s becoming clear FvD could still use our help (great example is SaneerMeneer&#039;s reaction video below), by refuting these lefties everywhere we can, and spread these refutals everywhere we can. When the truth prevails, we prevail.

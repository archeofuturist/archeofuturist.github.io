If you think about it a conspiracy is really any organization of people or things that does things without others having the explicit knowledge of all those ongoings. A startup can be considered a conspiracy. Any company can be considered a conspiracy. A biological cell, indeed, with its definition as being an object that maintains an internal environment different from its outside, can be considered a conspiracy. Now take this from our point N and do a dynamic programming type thing in your head back to point 0, wherever you decide that may be, whether it is in the dawn of cellular biology or in the dawn of human consciousness. What does that imply to you? How can you imagine humanity will develop and has it developed in that way?

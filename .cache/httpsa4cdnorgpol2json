Hell America too, but most strongly yours, on this continent. <br><br>I do not think we can discuss this issue because in a debate we have to be in agreement of the foundation of the topic and we are not. You believe a child&#039;s feelings are of such value that you would discard years of wisdom as an adult to be in line with a child&#039;s.<br><br>This is why we will always disagree. You also use the word gender dysphoria as if it in itself is some mystical affliction that one no can have a rational discussion of what it is or where it originates. I argue that it can, but you will be against the notion of entertaining this idea because you believe in the mystical nature of it, which is why you refer to it as such. You using &quot;newspeak&quot; means your thoughts originate from a leftist, globalist, marxist, nihilistic, atheistic school of thought with no belief in history or anything beyond the lies in which you were raised and now believe, simply because they tell you you are correct for believing them.<br><br>In essence you are a dog or a slave, a simple minded being who upon reinforcement from its masters, loves its masters even more without higher thought or reason for existence. Totally useless to debate with someone such as you.

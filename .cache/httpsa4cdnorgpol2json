The notion that Christians are different from others primarily in their legal standing before God owes much to a traditional (Augustinian\/Lutheran) (mis)reading of Rom 7\u20138. The Pauline meaning of \u2018justifica- tion\u2019 is much broader and evidences a quite different eschatological orientation (see ROM 8). The word dikaioun (\u2018to justify\u2019; first used in 2:13 and then repeatedly throughout chs. 2\u201310) means literally \u2018to righteous\u2019; it comes from the same root as dikaiosun \u0304e, \u2018righteousness.\u2019 It means both \u2018to treat as righteous\u2019 and \u2018to make righteous\u2019 (K \u0308asemann 1980: 25). In other words, God both forgives sin and converts sinners in \u2018righteous- ing\u2019 the unrighteous. The relational character of righteousness (e.g. seen as God\u2019s faithfulness to Israel, above) covers both being established and being equipped as a fit partner in right relation- ship (e.g. in 8:2\u20134). The same point is made by calling the gospel \u2018the power of God for salvation\u2019.-OXFORD Commentary on Pauline Episles page 65","time":1492255080,"resto":121190773,"id":"BSz+8V1v","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121200228,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)07:20:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121198683\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121198683<\/a><br>Even inside a particular religions, there is a large degree of freedom and diversity of thought. However, it is important to define dogmatic beliefs just as it is important to define axiomatic propositions in any coherent system of thought. The &quot;question everythint, man&quot; mentality is why we have--as mainstream beliefs--the idea that two memebers of the same sex marrying is just as natural as two members of the opposite sex, or that claimin to belong to the opposite &quot;gender&quot; should be encouraged, even by pumping the person full of hormones and mutilating their genitals. If you want to deny dogmas, you can do so, but you need to dothat somewhere else. You can&#039;t claim membership of that religion at the same time and subvert it from within.","time":1492255203,"resto":121190773,"id":"okzK6ML8","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121200905,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)07:29:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121200088\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121200088<\/a><br>Liar, the entire lecture is based on primary sourced history and Vatican published works -- nothing presented in the video is sourced from fringe outlets or random books. <br><br>You straight up lied before even taking a look, Walter Veith is extremely reserved and coherent, and as I said, everything in the lecture is taken straight out of Vatican library sources and mainstream history\/academic circles.","time":1492255761,"resto":121190773,"id":"lWDv1MSY","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":121198878,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)07:00:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"but still poland is shit country","filename":"yes","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":863,"tn_w":173,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492254056496,"time":1492254056,"md5":"BMG1o2vjjJuI9KrCsAJ1vw==","fsize":104828,"resto":0,"id":"jQaUL8\/A","country":"PL","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"but-still-poland-is-shit-country","country_name":"Poland","replies":30,"images":4,"omitted_posts":25,"omitted_images":4},{"no":121200680,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)07:26:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121200557\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121200557<\/a><br>Perfection doesn&#039;t exist anon","time":1492255577,"resto":121198878,"id":"ME+kJQEz","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":121200705,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)07:26:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121200076\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121200076<\/a><br>This, I would have 1 million polish immigrants instead of even 1 muslim.<br><br>You know when the inevitable British civil war happens the poles will be on our side and amongst the greatest warriors to remove kebab.","time":1492255595,"resto":121198878,"id":"LV4jTJ50","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121200769,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)07:27:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121200625\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121200625<\/a><br>I forgot, drugs like krokodil too.","time":1492255638,"resto":121198878,"id":"ndJzaI3O","country":"RO","country_name":"Romania"},{"no":121200875,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)07:29:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121200557\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121200557<\/a><br>I&#039;m handsome.","time":1492255740,"resto":121198878,"id":"kEw5lz2Y","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":121200903,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)07:29:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121200625\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121200625<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;same aids rate as spain and portugal and declining, alcoholism high but lower than many eastern european countries, divorce declining, abortion massively declining and restrictions being put in place, muslims either integrate such as in Kazan or Bashkiria or get put in line by the local population.<\/span>","time":1492255760,"resto":121198878,"id":"OsAVRD5Y","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"}]},{"posts":[{"no":121191792,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)05:17:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"How do I stop hating women?","filename":"MsZZeDF","ext":".jpg","w":617,"h":937,"tn_w":164,"tn_h":249,"tim":1492247878100,"time":1492247878,"md5":"EPBeCdUEKr\/jUrTa4EY4Ig==","fsize":49429,"resto":0,"id":"g7DC1WX8","country":"HU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"how-do-i-stop-hating-women","country_name":"Hungary","replies":186,"images":19,"omitted_posts":181,"omitted_images":18,"tail_size":50},{"no":121200843,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)07:28:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121200639\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121200639<\/a><br><br>Well poor worthless people shouldn&#039;t be having kids anyways, so there you go.<br><br>You are allowed to not have kids, Bilel.<br><br>Go with peace.","time":1492255714,"resto":121191792,"id":"256xtOm3","country":"AT","country_name":"Austria"},{"no":121200873,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)07:28:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121200590\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121200590<\/a><br>There is a very valid reason<br><br>Some hoe could literally take my 250k house, car and children from me plus garnish my washes for 18 years plus take half of all of my money.<br><br>If my great^35 grandfather heard that he would beat the living shit out of all of his descendents for letting it get this bad.","time":1492255739,"resto":121191792,"id":"GxEqrJJt","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121200880,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)07:29:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121200512\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121200512<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Men are to blame for this, fathers more specifically.

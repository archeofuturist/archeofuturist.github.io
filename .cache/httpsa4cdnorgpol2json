The first one I know her dad was killed in prison while she was 5 and she was raped by her white stepdad when she was 8. Her mom&#039;s a crackhead. I actually had a thing with her for awhile but cut it off cause she moved . She&#039;s such a broken destroyed girl . It&#039;s so fucking sad seeing her go on a downward spiral and I know she&#039;ll end up ethier a single mom to a half black nigglet or dead somewhere or both. She just wants to be loved but has no self esteem and mental issues and will go for any guy that gives her any sort of affection or makes her smile. Most coal burners will date any race from what I&#039;ve seen , there way too broken and lack anytype of care or selfworth to care about race . In her own words she said she thought of herself as &quot;walking human trash so what was the problem with dating any guy?&quot; Now don&#039;t get me wrong the ones who date only blacks and make it a race thing and say anti white shit should be shot. But girls like the chick I know? They have been failed by our race and are lost desperate hurt souls that can be saved ... maybe? It&#039;s real sad man. I won&#039;t ever settle for a coal burner ever . The fucked thing is im one of the few guys that could save a girl like this but there&#039;s no way I would. Since most alpha\/badboy type dudes won&#039;t save these girls and they are too wild to ever go for some beta cuck who&#039;ll wanna save her so her only choice is Tyrone ... so it looks like theres a 99% chance they end up single mom&#039;s with half black nigglets. Id bet all my money that&#039;s her future . Feels bad man how can we save these poor girls without dating them ? She wanted me to marry her and shit and there was just no way in hell I would.","filename":"Illse6833","ext":".jpg","w":568,"h":403,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":177,"tim":1493555949302,"time":1493555949,"md5":"C6HO7qHGIpfhuem5RT5IKA==","fsize":45934,"resto":0,"id":"dg\/DKFij","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"how-do-we-save-coal-burners","country_name":"United States","replies":14,"images":4,"omitted_posts":9,"omitted_images":2},{"no":123475709,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)09:07:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123473572\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123473572<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;How do we save coal burners?<\/span><br>Throw them in the oven with the coal?","filename":"klaus_barbie","ext":".jpg","w":620,"h":793,"tn_w":97,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493557626228,"time":1493557626,"md5":"j9zBoKEJejiTpxn0aiC8jQ==","fsize":87164,"resto":123473572,"id":"SXnFG9eE","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123475750,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)09:07:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123474629\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123474629<\/a><br>Geez man I&#039;ve seen that first hand.

It&#039;s tempting to accuse every man abandoning relationships of being a pussy, but you have to remember that there&#039;s always been betas in every society. Efficient civilizations mask the existance of betas by basically guaranteeing all law-abiding, working men a wife. The difference between now and the past is that betas are finding it much more difficult to marry and reproduce. <br><br>No matter how much you try and get through to them most men will always be betas. The most important thing civilization ever accomplished was making sure all these faggots and retards got married. Before patriarchal civilization enforced monogamy, betas simply banded together and stole women to use them as rape slaves. The reason marriage was invented in the first place was to stop this sort of thing and ensure the vast majority of men would be content to follow laws and contribute to the community. <br><br>Modern society has abandoned monogamy for betas and this will be disastrous. The only reason men obeyed law for so well and so long was because everyone could get married, have children, and not have to worry about getting cucked. Throughout history, there&#039;s a long trail of wrecked and fallen countries that were torn apart by internal strife when sexual rules were relaxed.","time":1492666972,"resto":121955352,"id":"VDBMtFzG","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121959241,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)01:42:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121958318\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121958318<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;99% of western women complete whores and would make terrible wives and mothers<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;state of divorce laws that will chain you to a harpy legally\/financially<\/span><br>hmm no thanks","time":1492666977,"resto":121955352,"id":"tCK15+lO","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121959259,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)01:43:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121958725\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121958725<\/a><br><br>Some of them are probably being exploited, but it&#039;s sort of voluntary, isn&#039;t it?

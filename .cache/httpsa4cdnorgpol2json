Then if the EU does crumble (which is quite likely) then we can at least rekindle the relationship. I am not so much arsed about them rejoining the UK, but i at least want us to stay close friends as nations. Some might say that is the case now, but with the north still being a sore point and the EU continually being a problem for both countries, I don&#039;t see the relationship being as strong as it could be.","time":1491329482,"resto":119481484,"id":"6\/sbQTIa","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119496511,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)14:12:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119487196\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119487196<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I think we would&#039;ve been better off under English rule<\/span><br><br>Really, lad?<br><br>Really?<br><br>Maybe if they hadn&#039;t cucked themselves to Islamists.","filename":"BritBongCop","ext":".png","w":612,"h":393,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":80,"tim":1491329536826,"time":1491329536,"md5":"V+1bqHb84BmYSybBbiuBTg==","fsize":336739,"resto":119481484,"id":"eDETEwMF","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"},{"no":119496512,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)14:12:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119496329\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119496329<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;used to<\/span>","filename":"farageincoming","ext":".gif","w":536,"h":500,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":116,"tim":1491329537168,"time":1491329537,"md5":"U8Zj9tKkBM47ayfgbc4VBA==","fsize":3881058,"resto":119481484,"id":"ypp9XRCT","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119496725,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)14:14:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119495568\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119495568<\/a><br>You do know, nobody says &quot;Begorrah&quot;, and havent for quite a long time, right leaf?<br><br>No, you&#039;re a leaf, you wouldn&#039;t know that, because you&#039;re a fucking imbecile.","time":1491329662,"resto":119481484,"id":"F1s\/iQ77","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}]}

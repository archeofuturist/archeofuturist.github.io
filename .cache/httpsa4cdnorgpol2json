You need to get your diet in check, stay active, and raise your testosterone. <br><br>DIET<br><br>Drink reverse osmosis or distilled water. (If you do distilled, supplement with minerals.) Avoid drinks with sugar or high fructose corn syrup. Energy drinks are fine but get the zero cal ones. <br><br>Make sure your carbs, proteins, and fats are coming from non-poisoned or non-refined sources. <br><br>Carbs -- get your carbs from clean sources like potatoes, rice, and quinoa. Avoid wheat and sugar at all costs. <br><br>Fats -- get fats from olive oil, nuts, coconut oil, avocado, etc. Avoid hydrogenated oils. <br><br>Protein -- get protein from animals. Bison is packed with more nutrients than beef. Make sure your fish are wild caught and not from sources with mercury. Avoid soy and other processed fake proteins at all costs. <br><br>Veggies and fruits -- get them at your local farmers market and make sure they&#039;re either organic or free of pesticides. <br><br>RAISING TESTOSTERONE<br><br>Get a blood test to see what your level is currently at. Our ancestors had around 1000 ng naturally. To raise it, first try it the natural way, by changing your diet and lifestyle habits. (You can find plenty of info online to do this.) If that does not work -- and it&#039;s still too low -- consider talking to a physician about starting TRT. Under no circumstances should you have low testosterone. <br><br><br>STAYING ACTIVE:<br><br>Whether you lift or practice MMA or ski or jog. Whatever it is you do, you need to make sure of one thing: push the envelope as much as possible. Make it hard on yourself. Embrace pain and suffering, it is what makes you grow. Recover. Then push the envelope even further next time. <br><br>Always remember, if you sit around with your thumb up your ass you are letting the zionists and pedophile ruling class win. They fully intend to create a race of gray sluggish weaklings. The first step in destroying them is to get yourself in order. <br><br>Forge ahead.","filename":"atrazine","ext":".png","w":2490,"h":1625,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":163,"tim":1493570351291,"time":1493570351,"md5":"pBMA52AgxM6VRjOcE43FjA==","fsize":196943,"resto":0,"id":"SbieX39i","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"reminder-transgenderism-is-caused-by-chemical","country_name":"United States","replies":293,"images":49,"omitted_posts":288,"omitted_images":49,"tail_size":50},{"no":123550902,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)20:28:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123550799\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123550799<\/a><br>You know what, fine, dont drink more water.

When the capitalist class has been completely vanquished, there will be only one class, the working class, and eventually the functions of the state will become indistinguishable from the functions of the society as a whole, and the state as such will &#039;wither away&#039; as Marx said.<\/span><br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/ma<wbr>rx\/works\/1847\/11\/prin-com.htm<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/ma<wbr>rx\/works\/1848\/communist-manifesto\/<br><br>ML uses a philosophy called dialectical materialism, see here:<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/reference\/<wbr>archive\/stalin\/works\/1938\/09.htm<br><br>It is recommended that you read some of the critical works of Marxism-Leninism so you can make an informed assessment of the ideology.<br><br>Resources:<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/ma<wbr>rx\/works\/sw\/<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/le<wbr>nin\/works\/sw\/<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/reference\/<wbr>archive\/stalin\/works\/decades-index.<wbr>htm<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/reference\/<wbr>archive\/mao\/selected-works\/<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/ma<wbr>rx\/works\/1884\/origin-family\/<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/le<wbr>nin\/works\/1914\/mar\/11.htm","time":1493598282,"resto":123550215,"id":"RmsriKG8","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123550674,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)20:26:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123550471\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123550471<\/a><br>Marxism is the antithesis to nature","time":1493598387,"resto":123550215,"id":"BNpQq8Oq","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123550766,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)20:27:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123550215\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123550215<\/a><br>Fuck this imma applaud to you with my fucking hands up, I&#039;m not starting my fucking self.

Pretty much all of the Christian sources I&#039;ve listened to over the years are of the Meek and Mild ChristCuck variety as that&#039;s what seems to be insanely popular in America right now. However, that&#039;s such a disservice as we know that virtues such as Honesty, Morality, Loyalty, Respect, and Family are fundamental pillars to NatSoc and Christianity heavily emphasizes such teachings but is often glossed over for more feminine, &quot;safe&quot; teachings in order to appeal to larger audiences.<br><br>I&#039;m tired of the Cucks that unemotionally beat around the bush, clergy that are clearly extorting their crowd for profit and care only for numbers, and pastors that try to sound profound pulling messages and sermons out of passages just because. All of the required reading and prominent traditional Alt-Right material has been fine up until this point and probably still will be for some time, but I wonder if there&#039;s anyone, or even an entire church, that fills this specific nich\u00e9 yet?

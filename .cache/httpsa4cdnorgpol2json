You know how small children throw tantrums and lose control of their emotions over nothing? Imagine that but with people who have adult strength and guns.

Expect your car and house to get broken into multiple times. I personally just started leaving my car unlocked. Niggers would go through it at night and see I didn&#039;t have anything worth stealing and they eventually just gave up on trying to rob me. There was another white guy on my street and he figured out his nigger neighbors were snitching on him whenever he bought things(like appliances or electronics).

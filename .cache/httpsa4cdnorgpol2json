It&#039;s so random and cool - it&#039;s like the show was designed for us Redditors, see? My mom says I have an unhealthy obsession with the show, but she just doesn&#039;t understand how funny it. I wish I could live in the Rick and Morty world and be their friends. Everything would be really and cool and funny if I did. Rick and Morty are so funny and I&#039;m so awesome that it would make perfect sense, but it&#039;d be even better if Bernie Sanders appeared. It&#039;d be so awesome I&#039;d turn up the TV in the common room of my dorm up all the way so everyone could hear the greatness of Bernie Sanders, Ron Paul, bacon, weed, atheism, The Avengers, Guardians of the Galaxy, Sweden, Bill Nye, 90s cartoons, cats, and fucking loving science.<br><br>I run the Rick and Morty Club at my school - we come together, browse Reddit, make some Deadpool memes and watch Rick and Morty. We don&#039;t talk to each other but there&#039;s a cute girl there I&#039;m gonna try and ask out. I&#039;m a nice guy and I dress well (fedora + trench coat + brown-stained underwear + well-trimmed beard lightly seasoned with dust and corn syrup) so I just know I&#039;ve got a good chance with her. I&#039;ve already messaged her on Facebook, I just haven&#039;t got a response yet.<br><br>Anyway, back to the topic at hand: Rick and Morty! My favorite character is Rick because his style of humor perfectly reflects that of Reddit. I bet if I asked him &quot;When does the narwhal bacon?&quot;, he&#039;d know EXACTLY what I was talking about. Also, did you notice he looks like Bernie Sanders if you squint a bit and use your imagination? This can&#039;t be a coincidence; MLG Illuminati confirmed. Yeah, that&#039;s right, I look at montage parodies too. What good Redditor doesn&#039;t? Lenny face, Illuminati, and Doge are so funny.

The reuptake of the neurotransmitters into the presynaptic neuron are blocked, causing them to continue to activate the receptors on the postsynaptic neuron. This causes the postsynaptic neuron to reduce the amount of receptors in its membrane to compensate, which is termed downregulation. Less receptors means less activation, meaning you either need stronger meds or you&#039;re going to be a zombie. <br><br>This is why most people who go onto these drugs become either fully dependant on them or have severe withdrawals when trying to wean themselves off of them.

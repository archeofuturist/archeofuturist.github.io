Western cartoons are improving but I&#039;m still waiting for the cartoon that doesn&#039;t dumb itself down and still has great visual story storytelling. I don&#039;t expect a western version of something like Rakugo Shinju soon but I hope sausage party was popular enough to make more adult animated movies pop out. As for anime a vast majority of it is garbage but you can still expect a few good shows every season and 1 or 2 good movies yearly.

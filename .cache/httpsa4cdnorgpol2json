modern democratic government for example, basically the way things work is an elite faction rules by way of media and propaganda. Whatever this elite faction wants is what happens. Implementing it is simply a mundane matter of crafting some propaganda messaging campaign. Voting is controlled by whoever has the best propaganda, and therefore whoever has the most funding usually wins.<br><br>This is the way things have always functioned in society. There is an elite faction that rises to the top and leads the people. The goal for accomplishing your ethnic and political interests is to get a group of elites that&#039;s on your side. We can pretend it&#039;s about democracy all day long, but this is the reality.<br><br>Second you have to realize that people evolved to be tribal. People really aren&#039;t compatible with others outside their ethnic group. The Putnam studies show for example that in multi-racial neighborhoods there is less trust, people go out less, have less friends, less kids, are less sociable....etc. Generally the cocoon in their houses and avoid social interaction. The only real sense of community is found between members of the same culture and race, things mesh like well machined gears. <br><br>And of course, not all races are genetically gifted with the same talents. For example, whites have much higher IQ&#039;s than blacks. Therefore you&#039;ll always expect a white society to be less violent, have a higher standard of living, more social trust....etc. This is because of the nature of what white people are and how they evolved. If you throw a bunch of minorities in the mix, all of a sudden you&#039;ve thrown a bunch of sand in the gears. Blacks in the US commit over 50% of the murders, and have destroyed some of America&#039;s greatest cities. <br><br>Therefore, fascism emphasizes your racial and cultural identity","time":1493724060,"resto":123755352,"id":"+5Lupjtj","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123757552,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)07:24:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123756261\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123756261<\/a><br>This antifa is working with isis.","filename":"isis_vs_antifas_by_neetsfagging322297-d9x22uu","ext":".jpg","w":492,"h":350,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":88,"tim":1493724279233,"time":1493724279,"md5":"GWo0mTte1m2\/TCb8BFZZBA==","fsize":60062,"resto":123755352,"id":"pyOaB7to","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":123757765,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)07:27:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123757173\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123757173<\/a><br><br>Hmmm.

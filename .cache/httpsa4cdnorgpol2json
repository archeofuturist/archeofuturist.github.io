Obviously, it isn&#039;t the fault of Delta that the family made a last minute decision like that. It is a matter of policy and what the rules are - if Delta says that the purchased seat must be in the name of a specific passenger no matter who purchased the ticket, then that&#039;s just how it is.<br><br>What is strange here is that if letting a toddler sit in a mother&#039;s lap during a flight is considered unsafe, why did Delta allow them aboard to begin with? If they care so much about one fucking ticket, shouldn&#039;t one of the reps said &quot;sir, you need to buy a separate seat for the infant as well?&quot; It sounds like they&#039;re ignoring policy at certain times and then enforcing it at others.","time":1493907271,"resto":124055628,"id":"otTHHXYH","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":124051778,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)07:39:37","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Argentina is White","com":"http:\/\/www.dailymail.co.uk\/video\/vi<wbr>deo\/video-1457587\/Argentinian-man-s<wbr>pends-35-000-surgery-real-life-elf.<wbr>html?mwv_rm=rta","filename":"5146546546241","ext":".png","w":646,"h":564,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":218,"tim":1493897977818,"time":1493897977,"md5":"eoSRMZQrTUEoViqh76Et8g==","fsize":269030,"resto":0,"id":"\/u5x2zBA","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"argentina-is-white","country_name":"United States","replies":70,"images":18,"omitted_posts":65,"omitted_images":17},{"no":124063323,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)10:12:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124052864\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124052864<\/a><br>:o","time":1493907141,"resto":124051778,"id":"7nGWjOoK","country":"AR","country_name":"Argentina"},{"no":124063407,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)10:13:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124063128\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124063128<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;prison island<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;a real contry<\/span>","time":1493907196,"resto":124051778,"id":"4FVuOzn4","country":"AR","country_name":"Argentina"},{"no":124063426,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)10:13:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124063128\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124063128<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;51st state<\/span>","time":1493907211,"resto":124051778,"id":"4GvKurKk","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":124063453,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)10:13:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124054943\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124054943<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Impliying meds didnt create western civ.<\/span>","time":1493907227,"resto":124051778,"id":"7nGWjOoK","country":"AR","country_name":"Argentina"},{"no":124063516,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)10:14:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124051778\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124051778<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Argentina is White<\/span><br>no it is not","time":1493907270,"resto":124051778,"id":"MvhYACpg","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":124048215,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)06:48:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;israel is evi-<\/span>","filename":"idf","ext":".jpg","w":970,"h":650,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":167,"tim":1493894939273,"time":1493894939,"md5":"q3bHoaOC5bq4WtjlXJFWbA==","fsize":139773,"resto":0,"id":"07a7GRI8","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"israel-is-evi","country_name":"United States","replies":216,"images":76,"omitted_posts":211,"omitted_images":73,"tail_size":50},{"no":124063054,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)10:09:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124048642\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124048642<\/a>","filename":"1481746383750","ext":".png","w":320,"h":240,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1493906960977,"time":1493906960,"md5":"2tMy9lAvmxjvXD9BUL32qg==","fsize":139370,"resto":124048215,"id":"8vBgfqdw","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":124063281,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)10:11:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124049755\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124049755<\/a><br>SSNIIFFFFFFFFFFBRBLRBRLBRLBRBLOOOOO<wbr>OOOOOiiiingfffffff","time":1493907119,"resto":124048215,"id":"WTmUrMiC","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":124063359,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)10:12:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124048519\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124048519<\/a><br>you can just tell her ass is absolutely insanely plump and round.","filename":"ass","ext":".jpg","w":126,"h":490,"tn_w":32,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493907166918,"time":1493907166,"md5":"BiBtkls61DcMG1rG9qNqwg==","fsize":24351,"resto":124048215,"id":"kG5JGzTH","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":124063415,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)10:13:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124050599\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124050599<\/a><br>what up with the racial difference between jews in israel?

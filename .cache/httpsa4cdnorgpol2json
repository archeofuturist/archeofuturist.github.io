All political movements are held together by two things: a mythology targeting the plebs, and a set of incentives targeting the powerful. <br><br>The mythology of the right is loyalty\/strength\/independence\/faith<wbr>, while the incentives are defence contracts, free jobs and education in the form of military spending, farming subsidies to woo rural strongholds, pro-religion policy, raising the immigrant intake then lowering it again to appeal to two diametrically opposed groups of people, etc.<br><br>The mythology of the left is exploration\/openness\/compassion\/rea<wbr>son, while the incentives are gibs to the poor and the black, pro-immigration policies to former and prospective immigrants, academic jobs, infrastructure projects that get funnelled into unions and contractors, etc.<br><br>Both sides have revolving-door lobbyist arrangements, obscure tax incentives, and other ingenious ways of catering to their demographics. As an added bonus, the media from left and right is good for both sides, because it reinforces the mythology and downplays the incentives. The movements don&#039;t need to give you as much free shit to win your support if you genuinely believe. Every time you get angry at gawker or fox news, you stop thinking about rational incentives.<br><br>As a red-pilled\/woke alt-rightist\/&quot;decent human being&quot;, you must choose a side. The way you do this is simple: you look at what&#039;s on offer, look at what the people around you are doing, and choose the option that makes you the richest and\/or most popular. There&#039;s no higher morality to it, unless you&#039;re one of the plebs who fell for the mythology and thought politics was about principles.","time":1492700371,"resto":121985402,"id":"iMs9+4AA","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"}]},{"posts":[{"no":122002417,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)10:59:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;yfw Trump has done more for America in 100 days than Obama did in 8 years<\/span>","filename":"1492608295920","ext":".png","w":717,"h":765,"tn_w":234,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492700370382,"time":1492700370,"md5":"4SFaK\/VsySEZpa526Unl+A==","fsize":604245,"resto":0,"id":"rfegsBAP","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"yfw-trump-has-done-more-for-america-in-100-days","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":121990045,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)08:31:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"Refute this shit<br><br>Protip: you can&#039;t","filename":"monopoly of life","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":704,"tn_w":227,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492691474662,"time":1492691474,"md5":"owEJWz29HefYlh2tFVwctg==","fsize":90885,"resto":0,"id":"xRtDHDqv","country":"AU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"refute-this-shit","country_name":"Australia","replies":278,"images":51,"omitted_posts":273,"omitted_images":51,"tail_size":50},{"no":122002334,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)10:58:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122000895\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122000895<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;w<\/span><br><br><br>the third option.<br><br>which is like the first,<br><br>but the 1st pioint is : &quot;extremly wealthy communists\/socialists(fascists)(psy<wbr>chopathic assholes)&quot;","time":1492700312,"resto":121990045,"id":"3fWx\/GLV","country":"CH","country_name":"Switzerland"},{"no":122002337,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)10:58:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122001916\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122001916<\/a><br>And yet you&#039;re the one who stuck around for this entire thread, dilligently responding to every non-argument us obese, kissless, unemployed losers can throw at you.

What taxes are cyclists paying? Other than the sales tax on their FagBreeze 2800 or whatever bikes for grown ups are called these days, none. Why should they be allowed to use the roads?<br><br>Also, let&#039;s talk about public transit\/buses. There is no argument against the fact that public transit\/buses\/etc punish those successful and able enough to buy and operate their own motor vehicles and reward those who do not. Public transit is a sink of taxpayer money, it harbors crime, vandalism, and homelessness, and it inconveniences the rest of us, forcing more resource usage and causing a FURTHER increase to taxes and even an environmental hazard.

This small group was also heavily involved in politics and decided who the next leader was going to be. Berezovsky, &quot;the kingmaker,&quot; dual citizenship with Israel, is a perfect example. He personally selected and installed Putin. But Putin was not like the rest. He immediately set about persecuting the oligarchs for stealing from the russian people, including his own benefactor, Berezovsky. Many fled to London, etc with their billions and have regular meetings with the EU to plan the downfall of Putin.

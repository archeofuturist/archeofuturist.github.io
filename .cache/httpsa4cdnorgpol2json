You want to talk about why it changes so much over time and it&#039;s because there are fewer cashiering jobs versus the number of total people in the labor market. You&#039;re assuming that someone with a useless college degree wouldn&#039;t work as a cashier if they couldn&#039;t find some cubicle job.

To many, this may be too long to read, as your attention span may have already lingered off in another direction. I&#039;ll try to keep these points precise and numbered, with a quick rundown on the topics at hand.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; 1) Each generation from baby boomers &amp; up is being bombarded with sexualization.<\/span><br>- From social media to magazines to TV to video games to erotic literature, etc., sex has been proven time &amp; time again to be the #1 interest in matured or maturing human beings. <br>- Every day, we are exposed to some form of sexuality. Whether it be browsing the internet &amp; coming across suggesting pictures or even nude pictures, or even going outside and seeing how slutty women dress.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; 2) With the decline of religion (mostly Christianity) in the west, sex has become easier to normalize in society.<\/span><br>- Social media apps such as tinder &amp; even apps like instagram\/snapchat\/etc. promote narcissism in women and the steadily available option to have easy casual sex. <br>- Because society is bombarded with sexual content every day, these social media platforms allow society to give into their degenerate desires.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; 3) Contraceptives allow for this moral degeneracy to occur without requiring any social responsibility to procreate<\/span><br>- The contraceptive (condoms, birth control pills, plan B) industry thrives off of over sexualization and social media to exist. Without these 2 factors, contraceptives would not be as profitable.<br>- Contraceptives promote the idea of casual sex by ensuring that the risk of having a baby is significantly lowered, as well as the risk of receiving STIs from sexual encounters.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; 4) Sexual Intercourse is losing\/has lost it&#039;s meaning of procreation between 2 consenting human beings who truly love each other<\/span><br>- The more that porn &amp; casual sex is normalized, the less emotional sexual intercourse becomes","filename":"eJwNwtsNwyAMAMBdGADzMDLONoggkiqpEbhfVXZvT_c1n3mZzRyqY20A-7mqzN0ulVl6s12kX62Mc9kqNxTVUo-7vXVBII4JKWWXPId_B4EduehCTtEjI_sAHjMyRSZCjPY1unl-vhkieg","ext":".jpg","w":613,"h":614,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491242970078,"time":1491242970,"md5":"sYPnuLrTpkaIe3Y6P5+Pig==","fsize":29912,"resto":0,"id":"wdrCFYsE","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"sexual-degeneracy-cont","country_name":"United States","replies":189,"images":46,"omitted_posts":184,"omitted_images":43,"tail_size":50},{"no":119368174,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)15:24:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119367489\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119367489<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;...<\/span><br>Nice argument.<br><br><a href=\"#p119367515\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119367515<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;these people have no problem at all finding people to fuck<\/span><br>If that was true prostitutes would make great wives.

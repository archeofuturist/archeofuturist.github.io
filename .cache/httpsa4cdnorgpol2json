Same pictures, same bio, same everything. The only difference is significantly more matches after a week of abstaining versus after a week of jacking off to porn every day. I have been deliberately taking notes on this for a couple years and I know it is true for a fact. <br><br>What the fuck is this? We all know that sexual energy is incredibly potent but how can it possibly be that my storing it results in more matches? I&#039;m setting you up, reader, with these questions because I already know the answer. Your energy permeates the ether and the internet is just a proto trainingwheels electronic version of connected consciousness. Or more accurately it&#039;s a conduit for it. We can all feel and sense the spirit of one another and that is becoming more obvious.<br><br>I know others feel this truth and it has gigantic, paradigm shifting implications. We see the concept manifesting everywhere. One corollary is in the obvious feuds of political disagreement between progressives and those against them, where all kinds of semantic arguments are trotted out when everybody knows the score on a base level. I want to preserve my culture and you want to destroy it, et cetera, et cetera.<br><br>What will discourse look like when people can&#039;t hide anymore? When flimsy arguments and speech that recognized as plainly false once you scan a persons soul, instantaneously, immediately, and without effort?","filename":"Tinder-e1443451532189-1024x512","ext":".png","w":1024,"h":512,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490505852691,"time":1490505852,"md5":"+iEkfyJZmn8OCegFFiIo4Q==","fsize":52676,"resto":0,"id":"A2Jrtsc6","country":"PL","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"ive-noticed-something-strange","country_name":"Poland","replies":6,"images":1,"omitted_posts":1,"omitted_images":0},{"no":118325721,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)01:40:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118324295\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118324295<\/a><br>you&#039;re getting thirsty and sliding yes to more girls and\/or lower class girls probably","time":1490506855,"resto":118324295,"id":"YKCOVFY8","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118325840,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)01:42:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118324295\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118324295<\/a><br>Youre being stupid.<br>I mean this factually, not malevolently.<br>You need to understand that correlation is not causation.","time":1490506946,"resto":118324295,"id":"WOA6WE2V","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118325889,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)01:43:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118325721\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118325721<\/a><br>This<br>\/thread","time":1490506981,"resto":118324295,"id":"yf\/4GiYj","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":118325910,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)01:43:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118324295\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118324295<\/a><br>its ahh, the universe, like, responding, to like, ah your,,, desires ,, and stuff,, my man, like...,., if you want more sex,, and uh,, u havnt masturbated,, then,, like you,,, put uh out like a uhm, ah a different vibe maannn","time":1490506992,"resto":118324295,"id":"cVv5c65T","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":118326029,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)01:44:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118325721\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118325721<\/a><br>this<br><br>you&#039;re probably drinking more too, the dick is strong","time":1490507071,"resto":118324295,"id":"SSUh6+yy","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118313389,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)23:24:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"When you realize that every single black stereotype (&quot;lazy&quot; &quot;simple-minded&quot; &quot;watermelons&quot; &quot;fried chicken&quot;) was created for pro-slavery propaganda and perpetuated through cartoons. <br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=C45<wbr>g3YP7JOk<br><br>Wew lad.

Seeing that AnCap has risen back up in recent months and NatSoc has fallen I will represent the NatSoc arguments.<br><br>Problems with AnCapitalism<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;There are no boundaries set for those who desire great power withen a nation, allowing limitless manipulation of the populace.<\/span><br>We can see this in what was late eighteenth century America. Rockefeller, Carnegie, and J. P. Morgan were making what would be hundreds of billions a day through manipulation of their workers. Their workers would live in towns these people would built but have no room to progress forward. People were exposed to harsh conditions and payed very little, no matter how hard they worked. Everything was owned by the conglomerates; the houses, the stores, the factories, it was basically a small city state. Along with this there was no room at all for competition because the monopolies bought them all up, claimed all the resources, and bankrupted their competitors. <br>Only when did the United States realize that these monopolists were gaining more control and lobbying the government it became a concern. Here the Sherman Anti-Trust act comes into play and breaks up monopolies and allows competition to compete. The world does much better without monopolies just viewing people as a recourse, while basically enslaving them and putting a false facade that there might be hope you will progress and become the next millionaire, but with a system like that in place, the millionaires make sure they stay rich and the poor stay poor. It isn&#039;t always a matter of intelligence but of the willingness to not view another as a human but as something to exploit.","filename":"Ancap_vs_NatSoc","ext":".png","w":1094,"h":300,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":68,"tim":1490502358663,"time":1490502358,"md5":"yPIcoW4HxpB8a3y9QVNTfA==","fsize":27324,"resto":0,"id":"pmub+yKv","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"ancap-v-natsoc-thread","country_name":"United States","replies":67,"images":8,"omitted_posts":62,"omitted_images":8},{"no":118325858,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)01:42:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118325637\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118325637<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;organized army forms and takes over everything<\/span><br><br>fun while lasts lol","time":1490506957,"resto":118319137,"id":"8m6mILfo","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118325917,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)01:43:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118324851\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118324851<\/a><br>I&#039;m not saying NatSoc should be expansionist.

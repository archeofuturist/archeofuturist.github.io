The man, who has been named as Ziyed Ben Belgacem, is seen struggling with a soldier for more than a minute before help arrives. Belgacem, a 39-year-old French citizen, held an air pistol to the soldier&#039;s head and used her as a shield. Police believe he intended to use the soldier\u2019s weapon to shoot members of the public.

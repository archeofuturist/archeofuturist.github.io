This isn&#039;t to say that all things on TV are geared towards brainwashing you. They&#039;re not. But most of the programming on television today is run and programming by the largest media corporations that have interests in defense contracts, such as Westinghouse (CBS), and General Electric (NBC). This makes perfect sense when you see how slanted and warped the news is today. Examining the conflicts of interest is merely glancing at the issue, although to understand the multiple ways that lies become truth, we need to examine the techniques of brain washing that the networks are employing.<br> <br>Radio isn&#039;t any different in its ability to brainwash a population into submission. Sixty-seven years ago, six million Americans became unwitting subjects in an experiment in psychological warfare. It was the night before Halloween, 1938. At 8 p.m. CST, the Mercury Radio on the Air began broadcasting Orson Welles&#039; radio adaptation of H. G. Wells&#039; War of the Worlds. As is now well known, the story was presented as if it were breaking news, with bulletins so realistic that an estimated one million people believed the world was actually under attack by Martians. Of that number, thousands succumbed to outright panic, not waiting to hear Welles&#039; explanation at the end of the program that it had all been a Halloween prank, but fleeing into the night to escape the alien invaders.","filename":"obey","ext":".jpg","w":300,"h":300,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490472873662,"time":1490472873,"md5":"NX73hTmPwe6DDOLOvO2O+A==","fsize":32024,"resto":0,"id":"wejaV5wn","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"mind-control","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0}]}]}

How is this NOT smuggling illegals? If a private NGO ship full of illegals wants to enter Italian waters, why is it not denied entry? It is not like that NGO ship is sinking or needs help, so no reason for the NGO ship to bring the illegals to Italy and Malta - the NGO ship can turn around and bring them back to Africa, right?<br><br>-----<br>The accusations made by European government agencies that non-governmental organizations (NGOs), while conducting search and rescue operations of refugees in the Mediterranean, have also been involved in people smuggling, have come under fire in a recent report.<br><br>The European Union&#039;s border agency Frontex accused NGOs of adding problems to the migration crisis. The government department issued a statement that blamed Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) and several other NGOs for colluding with human smugglers and being responsible for more migrants dying at sea. <br><br>Frontex executive director Fabrice Leggeri said that NGO vessels in Libyan waters had contributed to more traffickers forcing migrants onto unseaworthy boats, which have insufficient supplies and fuel.<br><br>In addition to this, a report appeared in the Financial Times, which seemed to support the claims that NGOs were in fact helping people smugglers.","filename":"Screen Shot 2017-04-15 at 10.46.32 AM","ext":".png","w":2006,"h":1090,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":135,"tim":1492246090533,"time":1492246090,"md5":"k878dphppBu9feYCcaMbOA==","fsize":2720815,"resto":0,"id":"lLnG\/k7h","country":"DE","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"there-are-over-a-dozen-ngo-ships-cruising-close","country_name":"Germany","replies":119,"images":10,"omitted_posts":114,"omitted_images":10,"tail_size":50},{"no":121203714,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)08:08:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121203438\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121203438<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;If you are on a private ship, you can say &quot;we want asylum&quot; as much as you like, even in Italian water.

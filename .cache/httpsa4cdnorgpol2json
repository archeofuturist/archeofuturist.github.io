VII is often disliked among traditionalists due to the it supposedly proclaiming heresy (it didn&#039;t, claims about heresy are easily debunked - in fact, it didn&#039;t even define anything new; what&#039;s more, it was specifically stated that it&#039;s not a binding, infallible council). Sometimes you may also see people complaining about the new liturgy, but leaving Church because the liturgy isn&#039;t as beautiful anymore is excessive attachment to human traditions that Jesus often warned about. Perhaps the most thought out argument for sedevacantism is that a heretical pope loses his position. There&#039;s some discussion about this, but even in the most positive case, pope would still have his position until a council declared hum to be a heretic - and that&#039;s assuming that the last popes have been formal heretics, of which there is no good evidence.<br><br>Orthodox are heretics first and foremost due to denial of papal supremacy among the patriarchs, but there are some other issues too - not accepting valid councils and filioque come to mind.","time":1490193559,"resto":117743867,"id":"v\/MhPlyR","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":117765584,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)10:41:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117745789\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117745789<\/a><br>You obviously don&#039;t know anything about the Orthodox Church.

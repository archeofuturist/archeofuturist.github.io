As people migrated to the UK from EU countries, and Poland in particular, supermarkets were quick to meet the market. Savvy entrepreneurs took the opportunity a step further, opening stores and wholesale empires based on the import of EU specialities.<br><br>But migration to the UK is falling. According to the Office for National Statistics, net migration to Britain fell by 49,000 to 273,000 last year. And with the country on the path to Brexit, the future for such businesses is uncertain. Can they cope with a potentially declining customer base and rising import prices?<br><br>For Anish and Minal Shah, the jury is out. The couple first started selling east European foods at their south-west London convenience store in 2004. Anish says: \u201cOur initial inspiration was one customer, a local childminder from Slovakia. She made the case for us to try a small test order. We sold our first batch in three days and thought we really could be on to something.\u201d<br><br>Following this success, in 2006 the Shahs launched e-commerce site Halusky selling EU speciality foods. Now their business is the UK\u2019s biggest importer of Czech and Slovak confectionery, grocery and drinks.","filename":"Screen Shot 2017-04-10 at 11.50.15 AM","ext":".png","w":629,"h":638,"tn_w":246,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491817972147,"time":1491817972,"md5":"Tw1hS24GHESuNGVTPZbmGg==","fsize":506183,"resto":0,"id":"uxF27vIh","country":"DE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"i-dont-know-what-to-say-brexit-seems-to-be-4d","country_name":"Germany","replies":79,"images":11,"omitted_posts":74,"omitted_images":11},{"no":120424757,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)06:56:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120424427\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120424427<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;anti-Brexit<\/span><br>How is this thread anti-Brexit?

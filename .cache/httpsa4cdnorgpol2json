It seems to be the norm in the west so you are more likely to be accepted if you are circumcised just for aesthetics alone. I like the look of cut penises better but that is just my opinion, I know there are a lot of ladies who agree with me though. I have had this conversation with my friends before and they all agree they like circumcised more based on looks.<br><br>I live in the US so I have never had sex with or seen an uncircumcised man but one of my roommates studied abroad in Portugal and she had a boyfriend there who was uncircumcised and she said he under-performed greatly, I think she just wanted to stay for his money or something lol, she got spoiled.. It makes sense that more sensitivity would lead to premature ejaculation and an unsatasfied woman. Like I guess the natural penis is meant to just spread the seed as fast as possible so it makes sense.<br><br>What I know about the performance is anecdotal but all the friends i&#039;ve had conversations with have agreed that we like the look of circumcised a lot more.<br><br>So what&#039;s the problem with it? It&#039;s a non-invasive procedure that is done at birth to normal kids. If I have a son I am going to have him circumcised just so he doesn&#039;t get made fun of by any of his future girlfriends, me and my sister had this conversation and she chose to circumcise her son for the same reason.","filename":"banana","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":720,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1490051145552,"time":1490051145,"md5":"XYyxHU\/DTb35ifcXbKOYKw==","fsize":91134,"resto":0,"id":"Q76ZiA0e","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"circumcision","country_name":"United States","replies":95,"images":21,"omitted_posts":90,"omitted_images":21},{"no":117561668,"now":"03\/20\/17(Mon)20:50:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117546750\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117546750<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;cutting off the most pleasurable part of your dick<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;non invasive<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;non invasive<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;non invasive<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;non invasive<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;non invasive<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;non invasive<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;non invasive<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;non invasive<\/span><br><br>Why can&#039;t you just admit you were wronged, instead of trying to convince the world that your mutilated cock is ideal?<br>I&#039;m sure your foreskin did wonder&#039;s for an old jew&#039;s face.","filename":"1482176801786","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":960,"tn_w":83,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490057452766,"time":1490057452,"md5":"VnKhIUx\/fZL1KliBZxNR8A==","fsize":62030,"resto":117546750,"id":"L4zNV9MM","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":117561723,"now":"03\/20\/17(Mon)20:51:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"Kikes are selling your foreskin for $10,000 in cosmetics ugly old hags put on their faces .","time":1490057475,"resto":117546750,"id":"oJwHF9dC","country":"NZ","country_name":"New Zealand"},{"no":117562343,"now":"03\/20\/17(Mon)20:56:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117554870\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117554870<\/a><br>I&#039;ve heard testimony from people who&#039;ve been cut later in life, made no difference to them in the end","time":1490057760,"resto":117546750,"id":"kCqMWMtR","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":117562736,"now":"03\/20\/17(Mon)20:59:11","name":"Anonymous","filename":"dicksandhearts","ext":".gif","w":500,"h":330,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":82,"tim":1490057951428,"time":1490057951,"md5":"bEJhTe4fUu14Lrggs+Dvdw==","fsize":1303134,"resto":117546750,"id":"04cxyl4p","country":"IT","country_name":"Italy"},{"no":117562796,"now":"03\/20\/17(Mon)20:59:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117562343\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117562343<\/a><br>If you knew how good it feels, you would also know how absurd that testimony is.","time":1490057984,"resto":117546750,"id":"L4zNV9MM","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]},{"posts":[{"no":117556151,"now":"03\/20\/17(Mon)20:10:26","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Brit\/pol\/ - Less ethnic minorities edition","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;May to trigger A50 on 29th of March<\/span><br>http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/uk-politi<wbr>cs-39325561<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;No-one else will want to leave the EU after they see how badly Britain is punished, boasts Jean-Claude Juncker<\/span><br>http:\/\/www.dailymail.co.uk\/news\/art<wbr>icle-4330846\/UK-example-stop-states<wbr>-leaving-EU-boasts-Eurocrat.html<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Nicola Sturgeon warns Theresa May independence referendum block will be &#039;indefensible&#039;

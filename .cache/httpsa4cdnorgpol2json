But when they refused to accept it, he fought against them and conquered them by the sword, avenging the blood of the Christian men which they had spilled often and for a long time. And when he had scored such an honourable victory he prayed to God, falling on his knees with tears in his eyes. Then one of his good men asked why he cried, since he should rejoice over the honourable victory which he had won over the enemies of Jesus Christ and the holy faith. He then replied: I am happy and praise God since he gave us victory.

The media reporting is going completely haywire with people crying for &quot;xenophilia&quot;, and how we must forgive the terrorist and how Islam isn&#039;t the problem but actually the solution to these attacks. It&#039;s obvious why: after this attack, SD is going to get lone majority in the parliament in the next election. The guy was a denied asylum seeker. If he had been deported, this wouldn&#039;t have happened. The only political party that would have stopped this attack is SD, and every single person in Sweden knows this, even the leftists.","time":1491735965,"resto":120266611,"id":"fZc8SC31","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":120272822,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)07:29:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120271007\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120271007<\/a><br>Geez.

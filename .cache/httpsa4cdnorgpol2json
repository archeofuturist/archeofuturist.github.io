A shooting justified or not will hurt everything we are trying to do.<br><br>3. No crazy signs. Memes are fine. But try to keep it topical to free speech on colleges , anti communism , and anti antifa. Stuff that people will see on the news and agree with.<br><br>4. Bring medical supplies to help your friends out. Stuff like gauze and whole milk for pepper spray (and chugging infront of minorities). baking soda and water is great for pepper spray too.

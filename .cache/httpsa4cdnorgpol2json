Like sub 100 iq stupid. But they are the brand of stupid that thinks it&#039;s smart. In fact that&#039;s where my story starts. You see, about 4 years ago my dad (my mom and dad are divorced) wanted to go take an iq test because he wanted to get into Mensa. He dragged me along and made me take one too because why not. He scored I think 90 or something. Below average. But I scored 140.<br><br>You would think that would be a good thing but it wasn&#039;t at all. First off he didn&#039;t accept the results of his test and got angry with them. But more importantly he, being a fucking idiot, seeing my score thought that I must be some sort of genius. He pulled me out of high school and tried to get me to apply for college even though I hadn&#039;t even taken the SAT yet. 2 years later I was living on my own and working at McDonald&#039;s.<br><br>I moved half way across the country to get more in touch with my mother. I hoped that she would be less retarded and a bit more comfortable to be around. She wasn&#039;t. I can see why the courts gave custody of me to my father. She&#039;s still living with her mom, and is about 10,000usd in debt. When she found out that I like to read about obscure science topics she tried to start a conversation about quantum mechanics. She had no fucking idea what she was talking about. But she thought she did. It was actually painful to spend time with her.<br><br>This isn&#039;t atypical of my experience with other black people. So my question is, as a black person, why should I even bother? Seeing my parents, it really doesn&#039;t seem like there&#039;s any reason for me to expect to do any more. Seeing other people of my race act like chimps, how can I be sure that I&#039;m not just like them but too stupid to realize it? I guess what I&#039;m asking is, what&#039;s the point of even living if you&#039;re black?

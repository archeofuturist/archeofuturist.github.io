One of the unique aspects of Rader\u2019s crime spree was his enormous ego; he kept in contact with the press in the 1970s in an effort to spread fear throughout Wichita. In an early letter, he blamed \u201cFactor X\u201d as the motivation behind his murders. Rader fancied himself as an aficionado of serial killers and said that everyone from Jack The Ripper to Ted Bundy to the Son of Sam had the same Factor X.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;After his arrest, he narrowed down what Factor X was: a demon. In 2007, he described it being as something that \u201ccontrols\u201d his desire to kill. He\u2019s even drawn it\u2014depicting it in varying ways as a frog or as a more traditional-looking demon. It was Factor X that pushed him that fateful day, he claimed. \u201cI knew somewhere along the line of eighth grade or freshman in high school that I had some abnormal tendencies at that point in time. But it exploded on January 15, 1974. That\u2019s when the ball game exploded.

You never figured out how to live in a society bigger than one or two squabbling families. Starting thousands of years ago, everyone else on this planet without exception did - they invented religion, the idea of law, and the ideas of property and respect for the value of human life. This enabled tribes to coalesce into bigger groups and become organized. The rest is history, or rather civilization. But your lot never did this, did they? Abstract thought and problem- solving have never been the black man&#039;s strengths, have they? Did they invent a long-lived and intellectually coherent religion? Nope. Did they ever build a city? Nope. Did they even invent bricks? Nope (the reason there&#039;s no Stonehenge in Africa is because it took more than 20 people to move the slabs of rock - clearly a non-starter in Africa, where assembling more than 20 niggers normally results in a war). Did they till the land? Nope. Did they domesticate an animal for their use? Nope. Did they invent a written language? Nope. Did they invent the wheel? Mainly, nope. Were they curious enough about what lay out across the sea to sail upon it? Nope. And blacks are the only &quot;humans&quot; on this planet of which all this is true. Eskimos are more technically advanced than blacks were, despite the handicap of having no raw materials to work with other than dead fish and snow. Indians managed to domesticate the elephant. Why couldn&#039;t niggers? So why do you fail everywhere even today? Let me offer you jigaboos a hypothesis. It&#039;s because feral behavior - innate savagery, murderous violence if annoyed, predisposition to rape many women and thus fecklessly father many children - conferred valuable survival advantages on individuals","filename":"1490612245385","ext":".gif","w":400,"h":222,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":138,"tim":1491046978072,"time":1491046978,"md5":"reSq6l49dK81enp98rQw7Q==","fsize":1450070,"resto":0,"id":"eBz5MtjV","country":"DE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"face-the-facts-niggers-your-race-are-a-failed","country_name":"Germany","replies":55,"images":14,"omitted_posts":50,"omitted_images":14},{"no":119179645,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)04:18:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119172147\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119172147<\/a><br>who are you talking to?<br><br>there are no blacks here","time":1491121080,"resto":119172147,"id":"2ZDS4lcD","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119179918,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)04:23:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119172147\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119172147<\/a><br>Nignogs eternally BTFO<br>screencap that shit","time":1491121380,"resto":119172147,"id":"fuBPM6xL","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":119179923,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)04:23:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"Bump","time":1491121385,"resto":119172147,"id":"1daWeTpn","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119180336,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)04:31:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119172147\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119172147<\/a><br><a href=\"#p119172184\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119172184<\/a><br><a href=\"#p119172220\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119172220<\/a><br><a href=\"#p119172257\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119172257<\/a><br><a href=\"#p119172285\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119172285<\/a><br>screencap this and include me","filename":"1490799163727","ext":".jpg","w":256,"h":256,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491121889379,"time":1491121889,"md5":"YnnzevGGrrZmCYpbTbYQjQ==","fsize":11286,"resto":119172147,"id":"w1jvGS7S","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":119181032,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)04:43:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"need a screencap pls","time":1491122627,"resto":119172147,"id":"mmOwejwK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}]}

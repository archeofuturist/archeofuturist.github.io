Le Pen runs this debate for the entire two hours - it&#039;s like watching Pence\/Kane again, only better. She gets in two very memorable jabs, one where she calls him out for fucking his teacher and another where she says &quot; a woman will lead France, either me or Mrs. Merkel.&quot; He stutters repeatedly and repeats dumb lines constantly and seems off topic, irritated, and generally full of shit. If you actually understand the policy topics you know that she dismantled him completely on each one. He frequently tries to wave his hands and jedi mind trick and she is ready for it and throws it back at him. This was the strongest debate performance I&#039;ve ever seen and one she needed. She even dangled a line about &quot;let&#039;s hope we don&#039;t find out you have a secret bank account in the Bahamas&quot; because she obviously knows about the big leak of his secret Caribbean bank account that&#039;s about to hit. She&#039;s running against an even stronger propaganda campaign than Trump was so she has to get everything right and get some luck to win and this debate is her getting everything right. If she does not win tonight and France is still holding elections after 5 years of Macron she&#039;ll win then. She absolutely exposed him as a pissant joke and schooled him on every single issue. He called her &quot;stupid&quot; repeatedly and made other derogatory remarks that would get him absolutely fucking shredded by US feminists. The French are watching and she changed a ton of minds today and redpilled a bunch of motherfuckers. Ignore all shills - I understand French politics, understand French, and understand what I saw with my own two eyes. Only the most deluded propaganda victim could see this as anything but a devastating ass-whooping laid down by Le Pen on Macron.","filename":"1492903836842","ext":".png","w":657,"h":527,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":200,"tim":1493868819229,"time":1493868819,"md5":"dSOBA3aVoeBfNgTcvuWmrg==","fsize":36227,"resto":0,"id":"J2SAI8FU","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"marine-le-pen-absoluely-destroyed-macron-in","country_name":"United States","replies":62,"images":17,"omitted_posts":57,"omitted_images":17},{"no":124022295,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)01:07:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"bump","time":1493874453,"resto":124012070,"id":"moePzaIN","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124022438,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)01:08:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124021481\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124021481<\/a><br>Im at least 2 times\/year in France.

I TRULY want those things. I truly want to be that person. So why are my emotions not tied into those things the way you would expect? Does my brain require more time to rewire itself? I don&#039;t understand why my brain is associating the things I actually want in life with negativity. Does part of me not believe I can actually DO it, and therefore has a sort of phobia associated with positive behavior?","filename":"jordan peterson","ext":".jpg","w":300,"h":168,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1493872604317,"time":1493872604,"md5":"I0iS+q+p8+t5U9PxFNovnQ==","fsize":6353,"resto":0,"id":"yqWJZabi","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-last-few-weeks-since-i-started-watching","country_name":"United States","replies":34,"images":5,"omitted_posts":29,"omitted_images":5},{"no":124022773,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)01:11:34","name":"Anonymous","filename":"CLP","ext":".png","w":780,"h":731,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":117,"tim":1493874694931,"time":1493874694,"md5":"EJtGwf2dg4VeOMTkh4J2DA==","fsize":144110,"resto":124019134,"id":"5NW6KVDG","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124023023,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)01:13:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124019134\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124019134<\/a><br>Because burgers are genetically predisposed to a toxic lifestyle full of empty carbs and game shows.

I couldn&#039;t believe how history had been painted in almost an opposite light of what really happened. Germany was fighting to preserve the West, our culture, and everything our people hold dear. I felt regret, that I would never have a chance to experience true Western culture, that nobody really ever will again unless some miracle happens.<br><br>Since then, I have had a lot of ups and downs (to put lightly).

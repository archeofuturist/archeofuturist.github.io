Ziegel and six other marines were part of a convoy coming back to Al Asad Air Base from al-Qaim, northwestern Iraq, when a suicide bomber detonated an explosive device near their truck.[2]<br><br>Ziegel survived but suffered serious injuries: left arm was later amputated below the elbow, three fingers of his right hand were lost, in place of the thumb the big toe was transplanted; Ziegel became blind in one eye; his ears, nose and lips were burnt off. Also he had shrapnel in his skull, above the eyebrows there was a hole in the bone.[2][3] For future use part of Ziegel&#039;s skull was implanted into the fatty tissues of the upper part of his body and artificial plate was placed instead of it. Ty also lost his tear duct, replaced by a prosthesis.[2] As well, some parts of the face that were lost failed to recover even after more than 30 surgeries.[4]","time":1493051166,"resto":122583350,"id":"VPluUZ+e","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122604257,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)12:29:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122583350\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122583350<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Is there anything more pathetic than a grown man playing dress-up and acting like he&#039;s a general and an admiral and a knight all rolled up into one?<\/span><br><br>Yes.

The whites ran large farms, which in turn gave them the ability to do commercial tobacco farming (among other crops), which gave the country an import \/export plus. This meant that everyone profited, the white farmer and the african farmhands.<br><br>2. The land reforms is basicaly like this:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mr. Smith has two sons and 1000 acres. The farm is passed down as a single enterprise that they both work on.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mr. Mbouto has three sons and once they are adults they get 1\/4th of his 1000 acres each. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; You now have 4 farms of 250 acres each<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Mr. Mbouto&#039;s sons have 2 sons each and they get 1\/3 of their fathers land each. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Now the farms are so small that they can only produce enough for the farmers to eat themselves, and leave nothing surplus for sales.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; congratulations, you have now gone back 300 years before capitalism started, and your country is fucked economicaly.<\/span><br><br>3. Mugabe had to quell his supporters, who were mostly in the rural areas, with giving them free land, lest they&#039;d oust him in a coup.<br><br>4. Rhodesia is no more, and Zimbabwe is a backwater country that only survives on charity and the few white people that are left.","filename":"tumblr_nrzq7uZAJl1rji3x6o1_500","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":430,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":107,"tim":1493051210516,"time":1493051210,"md5":"SgEzMsyjm\/6cFgdP42JURg==","fsize":126717,"resto":122601666,"id":"z+lAfWG6","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":122603931,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)12:27:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122603302\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122603302<\/a><br><a href=\"#p122603565\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122603565<\/a><br>Ah I see so it was niggatry, that eventually led to this nation&#039;s downfall","time":1493051221,"resto":122601666,"id":"W2yrdyaa","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122603999,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)12:27:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122602548\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122602548<\/a><br>No taxes?

And part of why I snapped out of it was I could see this.<br>Anything you suggest in leftist circles that might improve things for real people here and now, is always rejected. It&#039;s like how Marx called religion the &quot;opium of the masses.&quot; Anything that makes people happy, gives them fulfillment, is just lulling them into sleep and accepting &quot;exploitation.&quot; We need more alienation, more unhappiness, because supposedly that will lead to some glorious revolution and create utopia. Marxism itself, especially the Leninist revolutionary form, advocates this in economics too - the goal of reforms within capitalist society isn&#039;t to help the working class, it&#039;s to &quot;intensify the contradictions&quot; until the system breaks. That&#039;s how leftists justify their alliance with the globalists, who in turn give lip service to socialist\/progressive rhetoric - because leftists (correctly) know globalism will fail, will just lead to even greater inequality and oppression, but leftists think that will in turn lead to global revolution. I had even heard of some Marxist academics supporting mass immigration for that reason - the white working class is too content, to accepting of capitalism, so they have to be replaced with poor, miserable, angry people who can supposedly be won over to communism.<br>I got in some very heated arguments with people when I was involved in this, because I couldn&#039;t accept that kind of logic. And ultimately I had to accept that that&#039;s just how leftists are. They don&#039;t really know how to create anything positive, so this myth of some ultimate revolution is an excuse for what&#039;s really just negative, destructive behavior now. Leftists get under your skin enough from the outside, but from the inside, if you are a decent person at heart, they really really get under your skin. It&#039;s hard not to just hate and write people off, but then I have to remember that there are a lot of leftists who were like me, who are just misguided.","time":1493097222,"resto":122687099,"id":"B3Gie8a\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122696391,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)01:14:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122696121\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122696121<\/a><br>Thats because we dont bag it","time":1493097241,"resto":122687099,"id":"jXJJnzTy","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122696394,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)01:14:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"Let Canada burn","time":1493097243,"resto":122687099,"id":"VeQhgpez","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122696452,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)01:14:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122696225\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122696225<\/a><br>The Leafs chose to be cucks might as well get a piece of the action","time":1493097288,"resto":122687099,"id":"ZH8Rozl3","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":122667748,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)20:59:39","name":"Anonymous","sub":"UN &#039;utterly horrified&#039; by video appearing to show murder of Swedish Politician in Congo","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;American Michael Sharp, Swedish-Chilean dual national Zaida Catal\u00e1n and their interpreter Betu Tshintela were kidnapped on 12 March while on a mission to the Kasai Central province, where rebels have intensified an anti-government insurgency in recent weeks that has left dozens dead on both sides.

Just to deactivate your almonds on that, the white boys always fought back, but what mattered was the Muslim girls did not approve.

I am a black man, and I can tell you the Muslim boys were scared of us, they sucked up and sniveled and always tried to get us on their side in the &#039;race war&#039; on the playground. I wasn&#039;t even strong back then, they were simply afraid of me because I was black.

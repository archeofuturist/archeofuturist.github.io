So I am thinking of creating a hopper of memes. Basically, put memes u want added to video in hopper, run script, which renames the memes as per the convention and places them in a ready-to-go folder. once all the maps have been processed, get the ready-to-go memes and mix them into the production folder and make the video based on the date\/numbering convention. <br>that should create the memes in the video with the correct &#039;appearance&#039; time.<br>the same process would apply to any image file you place in the hopper - e.g. you could do a tribute to fallen, you could do weapons as they appeared on battlefield e.g. tow<br><br>And since you can annotate the base images, there ( getting to lots of work) is no limit to what you can do - e.g. draw red dots to mark location etc.<br><br>but i am really excited by the 2 levels thing. something entertaining, and something more meaty.","time":1490875657,"resto":118908654,"id":"9sk5Dmtz","country":"ZA","country_name":"South Africa"},{"no":118914887,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)08:10:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118914726\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118914726<\/a><br>That sounds like a pretty sweet approach to keep it managable without too much manual rename stuff<br><br>Good luck man this is great stuff, I mean it","time":1490875816,"resto":118908654,"id":"j89IxtOW","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":118915015,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)08:12:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118913747\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118913747<\/a><br>MISSION ACCOMPLISHED","filename":"ES","ext":".png","w":620,"h":400,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":80,"tim":1490875939166,"time":1490875939,"md5":"67dUKqP4dIsLhop\/3HoiqA==","fsize":433408,"resto":118908654,"id":"NelocJnP","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":118915160,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)08:14:39","name":"Anonymous","filename":"Pepe Nimr","ext":".png","w":530,"h":576,"tn_w":115,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490876079533,"time":1490876079,"md5":"bRpy03TQZrKvGFB5zkFY2A==","fsize":61543,"resto":118908654,"id":"bIDk0cw7","country":"DK","country_name":"Denmark"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118913809,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)07:53:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Poten<wbr>tial_superpowers<br><br>&quot;A potential superpower is a state or a political and economic entity that is speculated to be, or is in the process of becoming, a superpower at some point during the 21st century.<br><br>Currently, only the United States fulfills the criteria to be considered a superpower.&quot;<br><br>Just on this basis alone, why do all you other salty countries talk so much shit about us?

Property rights provide the libertarian basis. That means giving up on property is giving up your freedom, because when you have no external property (everything that&#039;s not your body) then you&#039;re at least temporarily denpendent on others.

By force (violence) and, thus, violating the NAP. In that case domestic terrorism and countereconomy will drive the coropration out, eventually.<br><br>2.) Voluntarily. In that case the people might&#039;ve been short sightet. That&#039;s not a problem, however, as peopple are free to not send their kids to those schools and educate them on their own, meaning that the &quot;megacorp school&quot; would eventually go bankrupt.<br><br>Actually there&#039;s a third scenario as well:<br><br>The company buys property\/businesses to expand.

There&#039;s a lot of ways to subvert them.<br><br>1) Remember, their mods get extremely assmad if anyone disagrees with their opinions. So if you&#039;re going to troll \/leftypol\/ remember to use a VPN. Here&#039;s the one I use to evade bans:<br>http:\/\/www.cyberghostvpn.com\/en_us<br><br>2) If there&#039;s one thing \/leftypol\/ hates, it&#039;s identity politics. Try to bring it up as much as possible in as many ways as possible. You can trigger people by posting with the &quot;anarcho-feminist&quot; flag. The best way to D&amp;C is to bring up subjects like immigration, feminism, etc... etc...<br><br>3) The mods really hate national-bolsheviks and Strasserists. Mainly because they see them as a threat. The reason being that these particular ideologies are very worker oriented but are also redpilled when it comes to nationalism and immigration. It&#039;s also a good way drop subtle redpills over there. You can also post with the tankie flag for a similar effect.<br><br>4) Be sure to exploit the divide between Marxists and anarchists. They generally don&#039;t like each other too much. Explain the need for a state if you&#039;re posing as a Marxist and be sure to insult anarchists as much as possible. Do the inverse if you&#039;re posing as an anarchist.<br><br>5) and most of all. Have fun.","filename":"leftypol banner","ext":".jpg","w":400,"h":200,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490201208391,"time":1490201208,"md5":"MQlWKXNVjdjcoU\/LC7wQ7A==","fsize":46358,"resto":0,"id":"F9tWHKSd","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"how-to-subvert-leftypol","country_name":"United States","replies":130,"images":49,"omitted_posts":125,"omitted_images":49,"tail_size":50},{"no":117803744,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)14:43:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117802802\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117802802<\/a><br>We are not white.<br>\/Pol\/ told me numerous times that we aren&#039;t.","filename":"IMG_20170204_205354","ext":".jpg","w":1935,"h":1471,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":95,"tim":1490208208718,"time":1490208208,"md5":"Rf205lhcbGL3QTjZGCMo3g==","fsize":1568078,"resto":117786866,"id":"cLoABNNG","country":"RU","m_img":1,"country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":117803807,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)14:43:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117803175\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117803175<\/a><br>cry some more bitch.","filename":"1485389971300","ext":".jpg","w":576,"h":864,"tn_w":83,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490208229700,"time":1490208229,"md5":"MTOScT+1y6KYCoTyYfZVhA==","fsize":141748,"resto":117786866,"id":"Pfp2CL+F","country":"MX","country_name":"Mexico"},{"no":117803863,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)14:44:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117803429\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117803429<\/a><br>Truly a solo effort","filename":"image","ext":".jpg","w":960,"h":723,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":94,"tim":1490208250558,"time":1490208250,"md5":"yYYj4rGi3wHU75vBir9IqA==","fsize":132579,"resto":117786866,"id":"fmxvwYld","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117803912,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)14:44:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117803588\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117803588<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;third reich: had to fight half of the world and nearly won<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;USSR depsite massive resources still failed economicaly<\/span><br><br>!!!","time":1490208268,"resto":117786866,"id":"pba35uC1","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":117803955,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)14:44:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117803588\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117803588<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Hitler: almost achieved his goal of Lebensraum and Gross Germany in less than 20 years<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;the USSR: fucked a lot of stuff up in 80 years then collapsed after mismanaging their garbage economy, accomplishing nothing<\/span>","time":1490208286,"resto":117786866,"id":"EXbuyZkB","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":117794842,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)13:48:44","name":"Anonymous","sub":"WHO TOOK OFF HIS SHOES?

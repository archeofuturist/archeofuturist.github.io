It&#039;s all a race for status, as you could probably imagine. Who makes what, fucks what, lives where, drives what, vacations where and with whom, owns what, knows who, etc. When you get to that kind of success level, it becomes much harder to tear someone&#039;s financial success and established clout down, so instead, they whip out their dick sticks, swinging away at eachother&#039;s character and how they got to where they are.

Charles Kushner blackmailed his own bro-in-law by hiring a prostitute, getting him drunk, taking him to a hotel so he could snag video of him fucking her, all so he could send it to his sister, to extort him and his shares, out of their family business.

From magic and ghosts, religion evolved through spirits and fetishes to taboos. Every primitive tribe had its tree of forbidden fruit, literally the apple but figuratively consisting of a thousand branches hanging heavy with all sorts of taboos. And the forbidden tree always said, \u201cThou shalt not.\u201d<br><br>89:2.2 (975.6) As the savage mind evolved to that point where it envisaged both good and bad spirits, and when the taboo received the solemn sanction of evolving religion, the stage was all set for the appearance of the new conception of sin. The idea of sin was universally established in the world before revealed religion ever made its entry. It was only by the concept of sin that natural death became logical to the primitive mind. Sin was the transgression of taboo, and death was the penalty of sin.<br><br>89:2.3 (975.7) Sin was ritual, not rational; an act, not a thought. And this entire concept of sin was fostered by the lingering traditions of Dilmun and the days of a little paradise on earth. The tradition of Adam and the Garden of Eden also lent substance to the dream of a onetime \u201cgolden age\u201d of the dawn of the races. And all this confirmed the ideas later expressed in the belief that man had his origin in a special creation, that he started his career in perfection, and that transgression of the taboos \u2014 sin \u2014 brought him down to his later sorry plight.","time":1490542175,"resto":118357120,"id":"osG\/SAbQ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118364020,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)10:00:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"Why does antifa always attract the beta males?","filename":"antifa","ext":".jpg","w":679,"h":382,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1490536809410,"time":1490536809,"md5":"trVjdMaM0QUmVZVfE5JQgg==","fsize":72978,"resto":0,"id":"Bx06tNH0","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"why-does-antifa-always-attract-the-beta-males","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":52,"images":13,"omitted_posts":47,"omitted_images":10},{"no":118372056,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)11:24:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118365066\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118365066<\/a><br>Trump supporter hands Antifa cunt over to police<br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=gzi<wbr>SClLdvbw<br><br>MAGA BITCHES","filename":"Antifa cunt","ext":".jpg","w":647,"h":378,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":73,"tim":1490541844748,"time":1490541844,"md5":"9+VotbTlAn5f0TtrFDZH\/Q==","fsize":42684,"resto":118364020,"id":"d+ZXG3MC","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118372425,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)11:27:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118364946\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118364946<\/a><br>Why hide the name of a &quot;trump supporter&quot; you false flagging dumbass","time":1490542056,"resto":118364020,"id":"nXaF8MD8","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":118372575,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)11:29:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118364020\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118364020<\/a><br>You made a typo.

Groups like Jaysh al Yarmouk are nonideological, kind of like Fatah. Then you have groups like the Free Idlib Army, which is somehow in the middle between non-Islamists and the MB influenced cadre. Then you have Ajnad al Sham (the Ghouta one not Hama), which represents the popular Sufi tariqa of Jamaat Zaid in the Ghouta. Then you have Faylaq al Sham, which is a traditional grouping of MB influenced FSA Islamists. Then you have Jabhat al Asala, which is widely reported to be a Saudi backed quietist Salafi group - aka Madkhalis. Now this one is the group best known as &quot;Wahhabis&quot; - yet they are the opposite of what you would expect. For example, Madkhali Salafis in Egypt support Sisi against the MB and jihadi Salafis; Madkhalis in Benghazi also support Hafter against the same. &quot;Wahhabis&quot; as traditionally defined shill for whomever is in power, if it&#039;s someone who enables them like the Saudi king, or someone who merely tolerates them like the Egyptian leader, it&#039;s the same to them. My cousins who praise Rabee&#039; al Madkhali (their namesake cleric), hate the rebels in Syria for example considering them deviants for instigating mutiny against the government. Then you have groups like Jaysh al Islam and Ahrar al Sham, which are more revolutionary Salafi types - dubbed &quot;Sururis&quot;. Finally you have AQ and ISIS, which are considered as Salafi jihadis - these guys consider Wahhabis to be infidels, along with everybody else who disagrees with them.<br><br>My preferred outcome? A pluralist society where nationalists, Islamists, Sufis, Salafis, the SDF, the remains of the Baath, can coexist, and ultimately, work together against al Qaeda and ISIS.<br><br>I just do not believe this is possible while Assad is massacring people for political reasons of preserving one family&#039;s power hold over the country.<br><br>So, where is the support for &quot;Wahhabis&quot;?","filename":"FSA flag","ext":".jpg","w":918,"h":918,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490541818072,"time":1490541818,"md5":"aNuijqtEpszgJVYRU0Ykuw==","fsize":208804,"resto":118358449,"id":"KrSHodVe","country":"AE","country_name":"United Arab Emirates"},{"no":118372028,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)11:23:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118371660\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118371660<\/a><br>According to information on casualties published by Jihadi-related agencies the first wave of offensive was made mostly of greenbused rebels from other parts of the country, they said &quot;we have enough manpower to attack for 2-3 weeks&quot; and it seems it was true, because it stalled way before than, so I think all the spare manpower from greenbused pockets started the offensive, took enough casualties to stall, and now they&#039;ve only enough militants to maintain frontlines &amp; checkpoints.<br>On the other hand Ahrar al-Sham did basically nothing (altough said they&#039;ll participate) and second phase that was about to be conducted by Turkmens in Latakia haven&#039;t started yet.","time":1490541831,"resto":118358449,"id":"NaS6WMcG","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":118372258,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)11:26:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118371999\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118371999<\/a><br>Haha no, salafists out!

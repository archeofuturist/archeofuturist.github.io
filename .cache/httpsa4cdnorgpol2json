Otherwise, the dog may have a false pregnancy where she pretends she is pregnant and shows increasingly unstable behavior. This was the first time I learned about the scientific condition in dogs called pseudopregnancy. I was immediately struck by how similar it is to the behavior of adult human women who don\u2019t have babies, especially ones who live in the affluent West. After studying this condition extensively, I speculate that women who don\u2019t fulfill their biological program of having children exhibit the disturbing signs of false pregnancy by becoming insane.<br><br>The symptoms of false pregnancy stem from hormonal changes. The female dog, which I will refer to as the \u201cbitch\u201d from this point on, experiences enlarged mammary glands and may secrete milk. Her abdominum swells, she gains weight, the vagina discharges a fluid, and there may be nausea and vomiting. The bitch may even exhibit cravings for certain foods alongside increased appetite.<br><br>Emotional changes are soon to follow. The bitch shows overt emotional attachment and even defensiveness for abstract objects like toys or clothing. Her nesting instinct causes her to hoard random objects like tennis balls, and she will often appear confused or disoriented. Other symptoms include aggression, depression, restlessness, and anxiety.<br><br>When I read the symptoms of canine false pregnancy, I realized that the majority of childless women over the age of 25 exhibit the exact same symptoms. The most obvious symptom that we can visually observe is weight gain. It is hard, if not impossible, to find a female past her fertile prime that is of normal weight.","filename":"pets3","ext":".jpg","w":550,"h":367,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1492041067896,"time":1492041067,"md5":"Hm9ZQBLWzKq6UrfKRgT29A==","fsize":49718,"resto":0,"id":"F2J63GRp","country":"FI","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"women-who-dont-have-babies-go-crazy","country_name":"Finland","replies":136,"images":36,"omitted_posts":131,"omitted_images":34,"tail_size":50},{"no":120849606,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)21:58:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120848349\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120848349<\/a><br>What good is a healthy body if the mind is desolate and impetusless?","filename":"1491864281910","ext":".webm","w":1280,"h":720,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1492048706446,"time":1492048706,"md5":"I\/A6ffQqyIiAkmEie8LIoA==","fsize":526178,"resto":120832520,"id":"nK0x20\/W","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120849662,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)21:58:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120849127\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120849127<\/a><br>Can you even telomers? <br><br>Fucking kids, clueless wuth underdeveloped frontal lobes, pompously discussing topics they know shit about.

Currently I&#039;m spending my holidays in Austria.

Pale pretty boys like you are regularly bought and sold for packs of cigarettes, cup noodles, and sugary junk foods.<br><br>I know what you might be thinking. &quot;It&#039;s okay! I&#039;ll lift weights and eventually overpower anyone who might have raped me!&quot; I hate to break it to you, but most cons don&#039;t let their punks lift weights in the yard. If you&#039;re caught anywhere near weights, you can expect to be shanked without any warning. And even if you manage to kill the guy who raped you, you&#039;ll still be a known boi. Those who have been, as the cons call it, &quot;turned out,&quot; will have their manhood stripped of them, and any avenue for social advancement is closed off for you. Statistics show that if you&#039;ve been raped, there is a near certainty that you&#039;ll be raped several more times in your life.

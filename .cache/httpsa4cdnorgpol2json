They presume someone guilty until he proves himself innocent. The normal way to go is someone is innocent until proven guilty. Therefore if someone accuses some guy of something, he is the one making the claim and has to prove it, until then the other guy did nothing. In murica you have the burden of proof if someone accuses you, which results in guys who have nothing to do with the crime but who look suspicious and don&#039;t have any alibi being fucked over because they can&#039;t prove they didn&#039;t do it because they were shitfaced in their basement. In a normal penal system YOU, the one who accuses someone, have to prove the links between the accused and the victim, the motive and such, you have to prove him guilty. As a swede you have no fucking excuse for making your retarded claim, every citizen is expected to know the law and by saying what you said you showed your great ignorance about the very laws that you abide to which is unacceptable for anyone claiming to be &quot;redpilled&quot;. Pick a penal code, pick the constitution, and start reading, you agreed to the social terms by living there, you have to read the terms at least.","time":1493831834,"resto":123917500,"id":"Txp+1Y39","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":123935111,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)13:19:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123934846\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123934846<\/a><br><br>In any penal system the burden of proof is also in negations, not only in affirmations, try and sell tobacco without cancer in spain without proving that it indeed doesn&#039;t cause cancer.","time":1493831986,"resto":123917500,"id":"kjlMbiDs","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":123935982,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)13:28:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123934846\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123934846<\/a><br>social contrat*<br><a href=\"#p123934579\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123934579<\/a><br>It is not a matter of demonstrating everything, or bringing another god and stuff.<br>If you say I think there is X, you immediately recognize your claim as an opinion and therefore not true or wrong, I have no problem with that.

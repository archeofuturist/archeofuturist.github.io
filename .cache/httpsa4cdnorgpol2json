Exploitation is when these two principles are not met, when the agents are not receiving according to their work or needs. This process of exploitation is a part of the redistribution of labour, occurring during the process of separate agents exchanging their current productive labour for social labour set in goods received. The labour put forth toward production is embodied in the goods and exploitation occurs when someone purchases a good, with their revenue or wages, for an amount unequal to the total labour he or she has put forth. This labour performed by a population over a certain time period is equal to the labour embodied to the goods that make up the net national product (NNP). The NNP is then parceled out to the members of the population in some way and this is what creates the two groups, or agents, involved in the exchange of goods: exploiters and exploited.","filename":"1485817932173","ext":".jpg","w":194,"h":260,"tn_w":93,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490931820233,"time":1490931820,"md5":"B+xUES01QN3hjATCQ4WOUQ==","fsize":13511,"resto":118961386,"id":"MLeF8lAn","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119015127,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)23:44:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119015029\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119015029<\/a><br>The exploiters are the agents able to command goods, with revenue from their wages, that are embodied with more labour than the exploiters themselves have put forth. These agents often have class status and ownership of productive assets that aid the optimization of exploitation. The exploiters would typically be the bourgeoisie. Meanwhile, the exploited are those who receive less than the average product he or she produces. If workers receive an amount equivalent to their average product, there is no revenue left over. Thus, these workers cannot enjoy the fruits of their own labours and the difference between what is made and what that can purchase cannot be justified by redistribution according to need.

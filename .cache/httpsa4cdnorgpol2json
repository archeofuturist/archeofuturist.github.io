Saudi Arabia has always been vehemently against Arab nationalism, also called Arab Baathism among many names. The battle for the Middle East is not everyone vs. Israel. It is US\/Israel with Arabia as the one who will assume power vs. Iran\/Hezbollah\/Syria\/Russia, with Iran taking power if it wins. Enough with the Greater Israel Plan, that idea never made any sense because if they did that, Jews would become a minority in the Middle East. What will happen instead is the Greater Arabia Plan. The Saudis dislike Arab nationalism, they dislike the idea of the arab race working together, whether they are Moslem, Christian, Druze or other. <br><br>So what did the Saudis do? They founded radical Islam. They pushed Wahhabism and convinced some Sunnis that all Christians\/Shia\/Jews deserve immediate death by radicalizing the holy text. The vast majority of muslims are not Wahhabi radicals, in fact muslims are the ones being killed the most by ISIS and other groups. This sparks mass immigration into Europe, Arabia takes exactly 0 refugees, and destabilizes the region. They don&#039;t want christians and muslims working together, despite the fact that Eesa (Jesus) is a holy prophet in the Koran, and Mary is mentioned more than in the New Testament. When you see muslims saying &quot;screw jesus etc.&quot; they&#039;re retards who aren&#039;t even muslim. Christianity and Islam are almost the same religion at their core. Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Moses are in there as well. The koran even says Christians and Muslims will fight as brothers with Christ in the end times for God&#039;s sake. <br><br><br>The Saudis created radical islam out of thin air with the help of Israel. They&#039;ve destabilized the region, pushed 60million Christians out of the Middle East over the decades and abroad, and millions of Muslims now as well. Yes, I know the Jews run the USA, I am not saying there isn&#039;t a jewish conspiracy, there is.

Don&#039;t you idiots think that if the Jews were really in total charge of everything on Earth, they would even allow such discussion to take place?

In my experience, this is at least true insofar as they are more tolerable than blacks and browns of all variety. I grew up in a suburb of LA that has the highest demographic of 1st and 2nd generation East Asian-americans in the country, went to elementary\/highschool with a ton of Asians, and pursued STEM in college, so I&#039;ve had casual and friendly relationships with asians. Having been raised in multikulti Commiefornia I have even dated 2 asian girls and gotten to know their families over the course of those relationships. So my question arises not out of a state of ignorance, but of discomfort with the implications of my own observations. <br><br>So what&#039;s the deal, \/pol\/? What are Asians lacking? In my adult life when I am forced to hold casual conversations with Asians, they don&#039;t go anywhere. It almost seems like they&#039;re (relatively to other races) disinclined to novel\/creative\/independent thought. In my experience Asian-americans do not seem like balanced adults, they don&#039;t bring the same level of creative freeform thought-formation that makes interpersonal exchanged interesting and exciting, nor do they seem to experience life with the same sense of self respect and individualism that enables the better aspects of Western society.","filename":"1492160562687","ext":".jpg","w":610,"h":458,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1492168449967,"time":1492168449,"md5":"WqkF8J9YPw6we\/YR\/8fWKA==","fsize":123975,"resto":0,"id":"aF5xdWni","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"what-is-the-deal-with-asians","country_name":"United States","replies":31,"images":7,"omitted_posts":26,"omitted_images":5},{"no":121050702,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)07:41:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121050432\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121050432<\/a><br>that chink is probably smarter than you though you bongshit<br><br><a href=\"#p121050432\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121050432<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;If &quot;the average Asian i s smarter than the average white&quot; how come east Asians don&#039;t innovate at fucking anything?<\/span><br>asians hold the most patents today you bongshit. white europeans invented modern amenities because they stole all previous knowledge from rome. before they sacked rome europeans were all subhuman barbarian tribes. go learn some history","time":1492170065,"resto":121048646,"id":"SMapc1Oy","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121050766,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)07:41:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121050330\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121050330<\/a><br>This shit doesn&#039;t even make sense<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;we mind ourselves a lot<\/span><br><br>Why the fuck are you migrating to other countries in such huge numbers then?<br><br>Fuck off back to China ffs","time":1492170119,"resto":121048646,"id":"XCIbqY9s","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121050812,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)07:42:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121049541\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121049541<\/a><br>This is a brilliant point.

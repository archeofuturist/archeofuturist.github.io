Trigue\u00f1o here (mixed European, Amerindian, African). So far I&#039;ve seen mixed reactions to blacks, here and abroad. There&#039;s the ones like me who&#039;d give further racemixing with them a try, but it&#039;s hard to identify with many of them culturally and some of them are loud and have no sense of decency, but so are many fellow latinos and whites (I don&#039;t like noisy people). Ebonics is a turn off sort of. Then there&#039;s the ones who like them and adopt stereotypically black behaviors to make themselves part of them. I use my appearance to reach out to all groups (euros, afros, asians-amers, mixed peoples), but I care only for myself. Of whites, I don&#039;t like that they are too decent (which seems fake to me) or degenerate in the image they portray. Or maybe I am a misanthrope and hate everyone equally.","filename":"IMG_0643","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":750,"tn_w":83,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490259173883,"time":1490259173,"md5":"jS2ijcfYS58bWsvshWeAgg==","fsize":79178,"resto":117901678,"id":"AJcUlmry","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117909760,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)04:53:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117906931\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117906931<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;latinos become majority<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;change national language to spanish or huehue<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;latin america extends to canadian border<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;take over canada<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;no longer latin america, just america<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;no more latinos<\/span><br><br>You right, ese.","filename":"9fbad290a3f05623598ed1318f3ad5cf","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":315,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":65,"tim":1490259230120,"time":1490259230,"md5":"5vg\/8ENdGgWRI6+5KG1n3Q==","fsize":46743,"resto":117901678,"id":"NgTNTeq5","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117910052,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)04:58:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117907929\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117907929<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;white people being bred out of existence <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;You can&#039;t breed blacks out of existence, that&#039;s not how it works!&quot;<\/span>","time":1490259491,"resto":117901678,"id":"Bl9paREF","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117910066,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)04:58:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117909691\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117909691<\/a><br>The thing I don&#039;t like about euros is that they are actually dumb and uncultured, and think they are the opposite of those things, but yeah in 2017 it&#039;s everyman for themselves except if you&#039;re Jewish.","time":1490259502,"resto":117901678,"id":"uLqc8cyE","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117910178,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)04:59:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117901678\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117901678<\/a><br>cause theres a thing called mulattoes idiot<br><br>only mexicans\/Argentinians dislike blacks","time":1490259587,"resto":117901678,"id":"LnhS3M0M","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":117908164,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)04:32:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"What does \/pol\/ think about smoking and smokers?

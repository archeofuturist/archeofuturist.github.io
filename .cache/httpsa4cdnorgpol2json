First off, you assume everyone is so bad. Let me point out your flaws. First, you said you were pretty much perfect. If that were so, you wouldn&#039;t brag about it, you would be humble and not attempt to gain attention from &quot;no-life\u2019s who spend every second of their day looking at stupid ass pictures.&quot; Second, you said we do nothing else than look at things on 4chan and the internet. There again you are wrong retard. I in fact only go on 4chan when i have absolutely nothing else to do. I (and I assume at least several others on here) have friends. By assuming that we are all people with no lives you once again prove your idiot ways to us- you cannot grasp a concept that people with lives can also use the internet. Third, if you are trying to prove to 4chan that you are perfect, at least type properly. &quot;but you all take to a whole new level.&quot; You forgot a fucking 2 letter word. Fourth, A&#039;s are not that hard to get in high school dumbass. It&#039;s not a sign of intelligence, but an ability to listen. Good job for using something that everyone can do. Go to \/sci\/ and get your mind raped by some actual intelligence. There you go; I just wanted to you about how wrong you really are. With all honesty, I really don&#039;t give a shit what you say only wrote this because it\u2019s fun as hell to rant to dumbasses. Next time, go tell someone who actually cares.<br><br>PS.

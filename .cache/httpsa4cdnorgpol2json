For example at microsoft, we have to do 2 &quot;connects&quot; per year (a kind of 1 on 1 meeting with a superior). We have to describe not what we&#039;ve done, what we&#039;re working on and how to improve in that department, but rather what business impact we&#039;ve had, and how we can align better to microsoft&#039;s business goals.<br>This kind of attitude means that instead of fixing all the broken crapware at microsoft, engineers have to work on 200% pointless bullshit that sells on lies, hype and cluelessness (right now, it&#039;s dysfunctional cloud crap and rule-based AI that&#039;s literally a bunch of regex and templates so bad it hurts, advertised as software that can do actual reasoning).<br>Because of this, the only reason employees stay on board is the money.<br>And yes, the h1b shit is core to the $$$ strategy here and there are pajeets everywhere.<br>However, the (real) research departments are composed of some leaders in the field and the requirements to join are very high.

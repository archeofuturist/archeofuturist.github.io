Seems crazy I know, but there is maybe a larger plan. The really intelligent planners know to use gambits like this, a hegelian dialectic. Like how the jewish bankers funded hitler&#039;s subjugation of jews. they could see the tides changing against MSM and decided to have a guy against the MSM and be seen as a kind of hero. Maybe related to project blue beam. It&#039;s a method of homeostasis. like if the MSM was a market, they were selling. This is highly intelligent stuff.

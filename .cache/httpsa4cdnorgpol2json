California was once part of Mexico without being Mexican.<br><br>The Spanish didn&#039;t even have a presence here until 1769. San Francisco was established in 1776. Most settlements were limited to the coast. About half the Californio families came directly from Spain. Only the pueblo at San Diego had poorer Mexican colonists. And there weren&#039;t many of them. California only became Mexican in 1822 after the Mexican Revolution ended. Most Californio&#039;s had expected a Spanish victory. Mexican rule only lasted until 1846 with the Bear Flag revolt and the arrival of US forces under Fremont and Sloat. So Mexican rule only lasted 24 years. The estimate is that the Californios and the poorer Mexicans of the San Diego pueblo together numbered somewhere between 8,000 and 10,000 people. This compared to a native population estimated roughly between 30,000 and 150,000 people. Even given the most generous possible numbers, Mexicans can&#039;t have been more than 1\/4 the population of Alta California.<br><br><a href=\"#p123174840\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123174840<\/a><br>My apologies my Olmec amigo.","filename":"1920_Alta_California_mission_trail","ext":".jpg","w":751,"h":1444,"tn_w":65,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493372402193,"time":1493372402,"md5":"FPi7NeMQLLSEFxtTy0F59g==","fsize":108564,"resto":123159101,"id":"sZRzcMMg","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":123175564,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)05:44:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123175255\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123175255<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Olmec amigo<\/span><br><br>American education.","filename":"US should thank us","ext":".png","w":1246,"h":918,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":92,"tim":1493372645105,"time":1493372645,"md5":"x4eS66KXDuPL8e6erGdcvA==","fsize":1041201,"resto":123159101,"id":"\/YQH4kpZ","country":"MX","m_img":1,"country_name":"Mexico"}]},{"posts":[{"no":123174914,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)05:35:11","name":"Anonymous","sub":"WE \/b\/ NOW","com":"\/POL\/ IS DEAD<br><br>WW3 IS IMMINENT<br><br>BUY WATER FILTERS FROM INFOWARS","filename":"1493341397648","ext":".png","w":1158,"h":834,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":180,"tim":1493372111335,"time":1493372111,"md5":"8RSQnGw\/XizbphWKPHjbeQ==","fsize":551947,"resto":0,"id":"BGDyXgkI","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"we-b-now","country_name":"United States","replies":3,"images":0},{"no":123175064,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)05:37:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123174914\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123174914<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;see&#039;s the good content screencaps<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;doesn&#039;t know what \/pol\/ is usually like<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;molymeme shitposter<\/span><br><br>Listen to the sick drumming on this song because no one wants to hear what you are on about.<br><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/GJnem-10YQQ","time":1493372247,"resto":123174914,"id":"w3\/XD9DJ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123175092,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)05:37:48","com":"<a href=\"#p123174914\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123174914<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;There was once a dream that was \/pol\/.

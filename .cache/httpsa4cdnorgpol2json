Reddit comes in here thinking we&#039;re some homogeneous, paragon of a board that they can flock to when they get IP banned from reddit for changing their name to nigger_xdd. What they don&#039;t realise is that this is a board of discourse, of different opinions, and of discussion. Sure it&#039;s crude, and rude, and we say nigger, but it&#039;s still part of a dialogue. Opposing views. Seeing who can win either based off memes or logic, depending on the scenario. Redditors come in thinking they can turn this into as big of a circle jerk as any subreddit, but it&#039;s against the ethos of the board. Sure, from an outside perspective, pol&#039;s a nazi board, but it&#039;s fallacious to assume that the majority of its users are. Most people just lurk and browse as a way to past the time, and because its a way to get news the msm doesn&#039;t always show. Some like blacks, some like jews, and some hate both with a passion, but ask any true oldfag why and they&#039;ll explain themselves. They won&#039;t shout NIGGER BAD LOL at the top of their lungs. It&#039;s baseless. It&#039;s why every &#039;racist&#039; thread here is jampacked full of charts and graphs and figures. Because of this, when the facts change, our views change. We base ourselves off of principle here, not off of politics. t_d supporters can&#039;t mesh with that kinda thinking because they came here expecting a circlejerk. But that&#039;s ok, because if pol really does shift towards a generally anti-trump viewpoint, then t_d wusses will just find somewhere else to commune and we&#039;ll be rid of this reddit shit for good.

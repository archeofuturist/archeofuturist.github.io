There is no down voting here, no up voting. Thread originators can&#039;t block or ban and the best you can do to control the narrative is try to spam and slide threads that are counter to the narrative you&#039;re trying to build. During the election CTR would spend eight to twelve hours a day trying to slide and soon as they shut down for the night, the board would go back to normal. The inability to block or ban forces you to argue your points. You can&#039;t simply declare something true and then silence everyone who disagrees. You have to defend your position, what ever it is. If you argue well and present facts, you can sway people to your opinions. Shit posting has no lasting effect, despite how good it feels. So you have to wade in, intellectually, and fight. And if you come at it from Marxist identity indoctrination full of logical fallacies and stay in the fight, it will break you. Instead of spouting buzzwords and talking points, you have to defend your positions. And even while you do so, you begin to recognize bullshit when you see it. And that&#039;s the point of no return. That&#039;s when you question everything. I compare it to the moment a devout Christian stops believing in God. It hits about as hard. And if you stay here long enough, it will happen to you. Get out while you still can. Have them assign you to Reddit or something, Just get out and stay away. But lets be honest, you&#039;ve gone beyond reading the script and are actually arguing.

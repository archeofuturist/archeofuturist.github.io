There will be a day when we will look back at the americans just like we look back at nazis now. Unironically killing millions of iraqi children for no reason whatsoever. All the evil shit that you did is well documented, it is easy to overlook it now because you are in power but once this changes public perception will align itself to actual reality. You will be seen as the monsters that you are.<br><br>2. Everytime you name the american, it will wail and scream &quot;it&#039;s not me, it&#039;s the government!&quot;. You have named him and he reveals his true nature. No responsibility, no honor, no truth, no self reflection capability. Just like the snake that he is, he will evade all points made and scream madly pointing at some irrelevant different thing. Example: &quot;Americans have caused the refugee crisis and killed and displaced millions of middle easterners for absolutely nothing.&quot; Their response: &quot;so fucking what, you jealous or somethin&#039; ??&quot;<br><br>3. The average american is stupid. Now, you all know this trope, but what you dont understand is that it&#039;s actually true. If you are from Europe you might believe that your fellow citizens are stupid but nothing rivals the arrogant, self righteousness of an american. It&#039;s the kind of stupidity that makes a person drive a car into a wall while loudly proclaiming that there shouldnt be a wall there. Americans have perfected the art of saying something without any truth to it whatsoever and loudly proclaim it to be fact. When put one on the spot, the american will simply start acting offended and indignant, loudly proclaiming &quot;so what, fuck you, dont you prosecute you, who the hell are you, i dont give a shit anyway&quot;.<br><br>4. All americans are fat. Dont let them tell you otherwise, it&#039;s not a joke. 30% of them are obese. Not overweight: OBESE. You can imagine how hard their statisticians have to work to adjust the numbers around to make this work.","filename":"sad syrian girl america did this","ext":".webm","w":460,"h":258,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1492537300546,"time":1492537300,"md5":"QNJ5S+DCJ6kPshCd00q\/lw==","fsize":1496393,"resto":0,"id":"Mnqrxxe5","country":"AT","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"america-hate-thread-fuck-em","country_name":"Austria","replies":177,"images":57,"omitted_posts":172,"omitted_images":53,"tail_size":50},{"no":121726458,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)15:25:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121726277\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121726277<\/a><br><br>FUCK YOU, you need to take a walk before i decide that you&#039;re worth my trouble","time":1492543503,"resto":121712814,"id":"Mnqrxxe5","country":"AT","country_name":"Austria"},{"no":121726639,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)15:26:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121726458\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121726458<\/a><br>Isnt he funny when he acts like he&#039;s a grown man.

While don&#039;t want to curtail discussion, we also remain very conscious that threads of this nature can attract the very wrong kind of responses, and it is an unfortunate truth that on reddit, outright Holocaust denial can often rear its ugly head. As such, the \/r\/History mods have created this brief overview. It is not intended to stifle further discussion, but simply lay out the basic, incontrovertible truths to get them out of the way.<br><br>What Was the Holocaust?<br>The Holocaust refers the genocidal deaths of 5-6 million European Jews<br><br>##But This Guy Says Otherwise!<br>Unfortunately, there is a small, but at times vocal, minority of persons who fall into the category of Holocaust Denial, attempting to minimize the deaths by orders of magnitude, impugn well proven facts, or even claim that the Holocaust is entirely a fabrication and never happened. Although they often self-style themselves as &quot;Revisionists&quot;, they are not correctly described by the title. While revisionism is not inherently a dirty word, actual revision, to quote Michael Shermer, *&quot;entails refinement of detailed knowledge about events, rarely complete denial of the events themselves, and certainly not denial of the events known as the Holocaust.&quot;*<br><br>It is absolutely true that were you to read a book written in 1950 or so, you would find info which any decent scholar today may reject, and that is the result of good revisionism. But these changes, which even can be large, such as the reassessment of deaths at Auschwitz from ~4 million to ~1 million, are done within the bounds of respected, academic study, it certainly does not willfully disregard documented evidence and recollections. There are still plenty of questions within Holocaust Studies that are debated by scholars, and there may still be more out there for us to discover, but when it comes to the basic facts, there is simply no valid argument against them.","filename":"download","ext":".jpg","w":144,"h":144,"tn_w":144,"tn_h":144,"tim":1492543435208,"time":1492543435,"md5":"PIwYRXRpl220u\/ho21Wx+A==","fsize":6824,"resto":0,"id":"V1NI5XE3","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"hello","country_name":"United States","replies":4,"images":0},{"no":121726591,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)15:26:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"##So What Are the Basics?<br>Beginning with their rise to power in the 1930s, the Nazi Party, headed by Adolf Hitler, implemented a series of anti-Jewish policies within Germany, marginalizing Jews within society more and more, stripping them of their wealth, livelihoods, and their dignity. With the invasion of Poland in 1939, the number of Jews under Nazi control reached into the millions, and this number would again increase with the invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941. Shortly after the invasion of Poland, the Germans started to confine the Jewish population into squalid ghettos. After several plans on how to rid Europe of the Jews that all proved unfeasible, by the time of the invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, ideological (Antisemitism) and pragmatic (Resources) considerations lead to mass-killings becoming the only viable option in the minds of the Nazi leadership.<br>First only practiced in the USSR, it was influential groups such as the SS and the administration of the General Government that pushed to expand the killing operations to all of Europe and sometime at the end of 1941 met with Hitler\u2019s approval <br><br><br>The Concentration Camps are contrasted with the Extermination Camps, which were purpose built for mass killing, with large gas chambers and later on, crematoria, but little or no facilities for inmates. Often they were disguised with false facades to lull the new arrivals into a false sense of security, even though rumors were of course rife for the fate that awaited the deportees. Almost all arrivals were killed upon arrival at these camps, and in many cases the number of survivors numbered in the single digits, such as at Be\u0142\u017cec, where only seven Jews, forced to assist in operation of the camp, were alive after the war.","time":1492543564,"resto":121726316,"id":"V1NI5XE3","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121726740,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)15:27:18","name":"Anonymous","com":".<br><br>Several camps, however, were &#039;Hybrids&#039; of both types, the most famous being Auschwitz, which was vast a complex of subcamps. The infamous &#039;selection&#039; of prisoners, conducted by SS doctors upon arrival, meant life or death, with those deemed unsuited for labor immediately gassed and the more healthy and robust given at least temporary reprieve. The death count at Auschwitz numbered around 1 million, but it is also the source of many survivor testimonies.<br><br>##How Do We Know?<br>Running through the evidence piece by piece would take more space than we have here, but suffice to say, there is a lot of evidence, and not just the (mountains of) survivor testimony.

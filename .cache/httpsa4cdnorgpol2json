Media reports stated that after Choi Tae-Min\u2019s death in 1994, his daughter Choi Soon-sil became a close advisor for Park and that during this time there were rumors (firmly denied by the president) of shamanist rituals being performed in the Blue House.

If there is to be no central authority or any coercive measures taken against the masses (from a state), dissolving said state to remove these institutions is the logical and proclaimed goal of the an-anything.

Borders for your own land exist, but remember, the central authority emphasizing the borders of the united nation are no more. You can have borders, sure. But a nation-state is no more.

The pact with Nazi Germany was widely mocked by the Finns, as was much of the propaganda Molotov produced to accompany the pact, including his declaration on Soviet state radio that bombing missions over Finland were actually airborne humanitarian food deliveries for their starving neighbours. The Finns sarcastically dubbed the Soviet cluster bombs &quot;Molotov bread baskets&quot; in reference to Molotov&#039;s propaganda broadcasts.[2] When the hand-held bottle firebomb was developed to attack Soviet tanks, the Finns called it the &quot;Molotov cocktail&quot;, as &quot;a drink to go with the food&quot;.[3]","filename":"Pepe resoration project public release Fremen Pepe","ext":".gif","w":420,"h":420,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491425910387,"time":1491425910,"md5":"TRxp\/QmbLSsG8gkbh9lv7g==","fsize":3796896,"resto":119646913,"id":"bzlQqb1V","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119655224,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)16:58:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119649174\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119649174<\/a><br><a href=\"#p119654976\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119654976<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;what are artificial wombs<\/span>","time":1491425918,"resto":119646913,"id":"N1djUeXQ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119655235,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)16:58:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119651567\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119651567<\/a><br>They&#039;re trying to recover from the millennia of inbreeding.","time":1491425921,"resto":119646913,"id":"EDs0+uaL","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119655338,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)16:59:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119655013\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119655013<\/a><br>Gotta go to \/fit\/ or maybe \/b\/ to find memes like this","time":1491425981,"resto":119646913,"id":"boT\/BJ+w","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":119655342,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)16:59:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119655070\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119655070<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Why Finland ?

One of the many reasons I can think of for deporting all illegals is their enormous cost, they pay around 15 billion dollars a year in taxes while costing the taxpayers about 90 billion dollars through public services which tax dollars pay for. One example of this would be if an illegal immigrant has a child who attends public school. The average annual cost for one student to attend public university is around 15 grand, now this illegals parents are not paying any income tax like the rest of us, essentially their kid gets a free ride while others have to pick up the slack.

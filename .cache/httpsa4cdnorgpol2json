This means that the masses do not have the power to remove him or her from leadership even if he is not functioning accordingly.<br><br>2. It does not allow democratic legitimacy. <br>A monarch is not elected or chosen by the people, unlike politicians.<br><br>3. It might lead to having a leader who might not be as serious as needed. <br>A person who knows that he or she will rule the country for the rest of his or her life might not take the responsibility to serve for the betterment of the people seriously. He is aware that he or she does not answer to anyone, which can lead to economic disruption.<br><br>4. It lacks democratic accountability and liability. <br>If a monarch has become an inefficient and bad leader, he cannot be held liable by the people.<br><br>5. It invests much power and fame to a single individual. <br>A monarch is recognized as a supreme legislator, judicator and executor. Though he is helped by personal advisors, he still has the final say, and no other person is allowed to break this.<br><br>6. Its structure is very difficult to change internally. <br>In the event that monarchs become irresponsible and ineffective, it can be quite difficult for the people to force these leaders out or replace them with those they think are more effective.","time":1493045564,"resto":122592120,"id":"jqBaSbyT","country":"PT","country_name":"Portugal"},{"no":122593758,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)10:53:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122593647\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122593647<\/a><br><a href=\"#p122592120\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122592120<\/a><br>7.

In 1956 Soviet leader Joseph Stalin\u2019s crimes were revealed and in the 1970s the violent aspects of Chairman Mao\u2019s dictatorship became more widely known, resulting in many people losing their faith in \u201ccommunism.\u201d Nonetheless, whether in Europe or globally, communism was more than these dictatorships, and we need to allow for complexity and contradictions when we study its history. Many millions of women and men gave their lives in the struggles to establish or defend socialist or communist states. These states provided their male and female citizens with legal, social and economic rights and security that many people are lacking nowadays. For millions of people around the world, the Soviet Union was a land of hope. The Soviet Union had achieved impressive economic growth by the 1950s, it promoted women\u2019s emancipation, anti-racism and anti-colonialism, and supported progressive movements worldwide. An understanding of either the Soviet Union or China as one-dimensional totalitarian and patriarchal states cannot explain their achievements in promulgating and implementing women\u2019s rights nor does it allow us to even begin to understand where their \u201cwomen-friendly\u201d legislation and policies came from. In addition, in Asia, Latin America and Africa, the USA waged military and economic campaigns against (alleged) communism.","filename":"12783903_1566097193704259_1592729455_n","ext":".jpg","w":1080,"h":1350,"tn_w":200,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491335191966,"time":1491335191,"md5":"rg1oqj94BEQFwepj9jM+MQ==","fsize":127088,"resto":0,"id":"x6c+Q2RJ","country":"AR","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"mainstream-narratives-about-communism-in-europe","country_name":"Argentina","replies":11,"images":3,"omitted_posts":6,"omitted_images":2},{"no":119507584,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)15:49:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119507467\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119507467<\/a><br>fucking cuck","time":1491335386,"resto":119507218,"id":"Zn93kGUO","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119507586,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)15:49:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119507311\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119507311<\/a><br>Womens do","filename":"13381419_141054099647942_1739225289_n","ext":".jpg","w":1080,"h":1078,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":124,"tim":1491335387650,"time":1491335387,"md5":"xpesDFB1IYocgMqTX1olMQ==","fsize":121136,"resto":119507218,"id":"x6c+Q2RJ","country":"AR","m_img":1,"country_name":"Argentina"},{"no":119507738,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)15:50:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119507584\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119507584<\/a><br>feck off","filename":"1485349204660","ext":".png","w":592,"h":855,"tn_w":86,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491335458083,"time":1491335458,"md5":"ZHM63Hr2pzk3Rd+9hKHDcg==","fsize":407527,"resto":119507218,"id":"HcO24qsF","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119508541,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)15:57:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119507218\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119507218<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Legal, social and economic rights<\/span><br><br>I guess everyone had an equal chance of being executed or going to the gulag since the charges were usually made up anyway.

To many, this may be too long to read, as your attention span may have already lingered off in another direction. I&#039;ll try to keep these points precise and numbered, with a quick rundown on the topics at hand.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; 1) Each generation from baby boomers &amp; up is being bombarded with sexualization.<\/span><br>- From social media to magazines to TV to video games to erotic literature, etc., sex has been proven time &amp; time again to be the #1 interest in matured or maturing human beings. <br>- Every day, we are exposed to some form of sexuality. Whether it be browsing the internet &amp; coming across suggesting pictures or even nude pictures, or even going outside and seeing how slutty women dress.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; 2) With the decline of religion (mostly Christianity) in the west, sex has become easier to normalize in society.<\/span><br>- Social media apps such as tinder &amp; even apps like instagram\/snapchat\/etc. promote narcissism in women and the steadily available option to have easy casual sex. <br>- Because society is bombarded with sexual content every day, these social media platforms allow society to give into their degenerate desires.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; 3) Contraceptives allow for this moral degeneracy to occur without requiring any social responsibility to procreate<\/span><br>- The contraceptive (condoms, birth control pills, plan B) industry thrives off of over sexualization and social media to exist. Without these 2 factors, contraceptives would not be as profitable.<br>- Contraceptives promote the idea of casual sex by ensuring that the risk of having a baby is significantly lowered, as well as the risk of receiving STIs from sexual encounters.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; 4) Sexual Intercourse is losing\/has lost it&#039;s meaning of procreation between 2 consenting human beings who truly love each other<\/span><br>- The more that porn &amp; casual sex is normalized, the less emotional sexual intercourse becomes","filename":"1491335189477","ext":".jpg","w":720,"h":1280,"tn_w":140,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491335625044,"time":1491335625,"md5":"Z65HYGpcjCU7YUl+vvIE5w==","fsize":167399,"resto":0,"id":"UJoFoktm","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"sexual-degeneracy","country_name":"United States","replies":3,"images":0},{"no":119508126,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)15:54:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt; 4) Continuing on:<\/span><br>- Sex has become a means of selfish pleasure for the individual instead of a unifying intimate bond between two people to encourage the prolonging of the human race.<br>- Women will post suggestive pictures on social media to show off their fertility to get compliments as a mean of narcissistic self-validation. This behavior is very common especially with over sexualization and social media platforms that open their arms to this behavior.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; 5) Porn\/Sexualization is used as a weapon to control the masses<\/span><br>- This is the final point I am going to make about sexual degeneracy. (And it happens to be the most essential\/important redpill any man can swallow)<br>- Israeli Forces broadcasted pornography in Palestine while it&#039;s residents were confined to their homes. This was used as an alternative to broadcasting world news, which could anger the masses. Instead of removing all forms of entertainment, they chose to keep TVs within households and broadcast pornography on them. This caused the Palestinians to feel complacent with their current state, and therefore snuffed the potential flame of rebellion. <br>- He who controls the flow of porn, controls the willpower of the human race. Porn is a very powerful tool that has the possibility to become just as addictive as heroin, as the orgasm has very similar effects to the drug in terms of dopamine &amp; serotonin release. <br>- With the rise of sexualization, women become far more disloyal and give into degeneracy easier, which leads to interracial sex with men who tend to have larger penis size (Africans)<br>- With promiscuity on the rise, birth rates begin to decline between people of the same race &amp; begin to rise between people of the opposite race. This is a tool by the globalist elite to cause a multicultural society driven solely by sexual desire as a form of motivation.","time":1491335665,"resto":119508050,"id":"UJoFoktm","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119508322,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)15:56:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"tl;dr<br><br>sauce on girl so i can fap?","time":1491335765,"resto":119508050,"id":"UVmK\/7BU","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119508743,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)15:59:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;sex<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;normal<\/span><br><br>it&#039;s completely alien to all of us dude wtf you&#039;re talking about","time":1491335980,"resto":119508050,"id":"1lEgQWtt","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"}]},{"posts":[{"no":119500695,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)14:51:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"Jesus Lived","filename":"1437277978265","ext":".jpg","w":2000,"h":1754,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":219,"tim":1491331866600,"time":1491331866,"md5":"kTAhRkR1\/3sl4EfKo2oLVQ==","fsize":3162748,"resto":0,"id":"snlQZdbj","country":"PL","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"jesus-lived","country_name":"Poland","replies":25,"images":3,"omitted_posts":20,"omitted_images":3},{"no":119508143,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)15:54:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119507685\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119507685<\/a><br>Like I said, help yourself and those, who are close to you, but help those too, who have nothing.","time":1491335674,"resto":119500695,"id":"ood\/eAxe","country":"HU","country_name":"Hungary"},{"no":119508244,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)15:55:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119507939\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119507939<\/a><br><a href=\"#p119508143\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119508143<\/a><br>Also, this.

Electronic bidet-integrated toilets, along with functions like toilet seat warmers, are commonly found in Japan.<br>In northern Europe, bidets are rare, although in Finland bidet showers are common.[7] Bidet showers are also common in South-East Asia, South Asia and parts of the Middle East.<br>In 1980, the first &quot;paperless toilet&quot; was launched in Japan by manufacturer Toto,[8] a combination of toilet and bidet which also dries the user after washing. These combination toilet-bidets (washlet) with seat warmers, or attachable bidets are particularly popular in Japan and South Korea, found in approximately 60% of households.[citation needed] They are commonly found in hotels and even some public facilities.

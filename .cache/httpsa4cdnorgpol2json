One presupposes minarchic monopolistic governance whilst one presupposes polycentric governance.<br><br>(II): Both philosophies endorse disallowance (not mere &#039;regulation&#039;) of violating private property. Thus --- in libertarianism --- when pollution is violating someones&#039; property or person, a legal case is brought against whatever organization is polluting and a governmental court exacts propitious restitution for all parties harmed. This is better than bureaucratic regulation which often forbids innocuous activities whilst excepting polluters from paying full restitution. The process is identical in anarcho-capitalism except courts and enforcers are private and polycentric. <br><br>(III): In Techno-Commercialism, a sovereign company governs a micro-state and prevents private courts and enforcers from engaging in Hobbesian warfare whilst providing a sovereign court of final appeal.","filename":"1490157908057","ext":".png","w":853,"h":1025,"tn_w":104,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491712942678,"time":1491712942,"md5":"\/R38vGipZQF4ujBVs1JFUA==","fsize":137520,"resto":120235595,"id":"NTHvPqTZ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120239108,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)00:44:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"Why do you think the state would be a good solution to pollution? <br><br>Seems to me like the countries with the history of the most controlling governments are also the most polluted ones.","time":1491713092,"resto":120235595,"id":"sZOtWZz6","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":120225655,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)22:48:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"What exactly did Kushner do?<br><br>All of a sudden, Kushner is the mastermind behind all the anti-MAGA, pro-Neocon plots?

Everybody is being labelled a shill nowadays, and it&#039;s hard to even think clearly, nevermind participate in post-Ron Paul \/pol\/, nevermind post 2016 election. Believe it or not, \/pol\/ is not one person. One of the main reasons I supported Trump was his non-interventionist, anti-globalist, America First policy. Shooting missiles over a few dead kids violates that, in my opinion. While I&#039;m not dumping Trump, I will always support my beliefs over any personality. Lately I&#039;ve been fearing that I was essentially voting for Bannon, not Trump. And now Kike Kushner, who I don&#039;t know if he has a real position in the cabinet, seems to have a more influential position than our actual secretary of state. The nose knows, I guess. <br>I&#039;ve always believed that actions speak louder than words as well. Trump spoke of politicians being all talk and no action, and now we see him close to stepping in the moccasins of Bush, Hillary, and Obama. My support is behind Trump for now, but I&#039;m starting to get skeptical. He is a politician now, and power corrupts. He seems to be willing to betray his voting base to make everybody else happy. If you watch old Can&#039;t Stump the Trump videos or have attending one of his rallies irl and felt the energy, things are definitely much different now. I was a Rand supporter until July 2015 where I hopped onto the Trump Train. Has he lost his energy? This is a very conflicting time for me and I&#039;m sure for others as well. Fuck Jews and fuck shills, and I wish you bros a peaceful night.","filename":"received_10212576591638421","ext":".jpg","w":800,"h":438,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":136,"tim":1491709052244,"time":1491709052,"md5":"MyNbEY6r5d4kM\/66ThlsNw==","fsize":47943,"resto":0,"id":"0dxlvZrU","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"holy-shit-pol-everybody-is-being-labelled-a-shill","country_name":"United States","replies":29,"images":8,"omitted_posts":24,"omitted_images":6},{"no":120238174,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)00:36:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120235931\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120235931<\/a><br>that sucked","time":1491712566,"resto":120231606,"id":"auRzJwS5","country":"CO","country_name":"Colombia"},{"no":120238451,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)00:38:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120231606\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120231606<\/a><br>I feel you, OP.

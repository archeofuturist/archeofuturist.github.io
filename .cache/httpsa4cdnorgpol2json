The biggest problem I face with national socialism is the problem of succession. How do you decide who leads the country next when most fascist states just dissolve after one leader?<br><br>You could try a vote but that&#039;s kind of stupid given the fascist state is very powerful and would more than likely just rig it. Doesn&#039;t really stop democracies either.<br><br>You could try more of a aristocrat republic sort of thing back when only wealthy land owners voted, but that&#039;s kind of just the same thing as rigging.<br><br>So I support a hereditary monarchy style of system. The reason for that being is so the leader actually has a reason to keep the country stable rather than going full despot. A king won&#039;t turn the country into horse shit by being a cunt because his son will inherent a country who will probably kill him. So there&#039;s a good incentive for a monarch to take things slow and steady.<br><br>Another benefit to that is there will almost never be a question or uncertainty of who&#039;s going to run the country. Every election cycle business and consumer confidence goes down because people are unsure on who&#039;s going to win. When people are fully aware of who&#039;s going to be in power next, there&#039;s nothing to worry about. Take Saudi for example, their king recently died and the prince took the seat instantly there wasn&#039;t any confusion with the people.<br><br>Having a monarchy also gives accountability. The leaders head is on the line if the people become unhappy. It&#039;s his decisions and everybody knows it rather than this ambiguous mass that is parliaments today it&#039;s just the two major parties throwing blame at each other for what the other did.","time":1492265674,"resto":121197974,"id":"9iNIdTdY","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"}]},{"posts":[{"no":121204703,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)08:21:11","name":"Anonymous","sub":"How does one not cry watching something like this?","com":"Europe could have been great.

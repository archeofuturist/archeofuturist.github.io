I&#039;ll be candid, I&#039;m also an atheist, but I don&#039;t allow myself to fall into the pit of despair that is an absence of faith. I do creative work; illustrate, tell stories, that sort of thing, and in order to be creative, you need to be a person of faith. A person who can think and feel in broader ways than a person of no faith; who lacks guidance and meaning to his pitiful existence. <br><br>The problem with atheism isn&#039;t the absence of religion, but of faith. If you keep your faith intact, you&#039;re in business. The Swedish people are very uninspired. There&#039;s nothing that guides them. For most people that guiding light is God, and it does them well. The human animal has severe constraints. Mental; emotional. Some emotional placating has to happen. That&#039;s called faith. Like a warm bosom to snuggle up to when life gets you down. Without that bosom, you&#039;re as a motherless child; cold and empty, and bound for failure.","time":1490305464,"resto":117984918,"id":"PbaNKwBa","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":117988626,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)17:44:49","name":"Norway","com":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/SheriffClarke\/s<wbr>tatus\/845026762341855232","filename":"1478530403216","ext":".png","w":628,"h":708,"tn_w":110,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490305489059,"time":1490305489,"md5":"ZnVvV4MFdnFpnd5AcwHUbQ==","fsize":465799,"resto":117984918,"id":"MJWy\/vqN","country":"NO","trip":"!!xGQ9rF\/02Zl","country_name":"Norway"}]},{"posts":[{"no":117969630,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)15:14:28","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Actual opinions thread","com":"So, when you&#039;re not on \/pol\/ LARPing as a fascist, what are your actual views offline?

Sorry atheists but atheism is not on the rise nor is it winning. It&#039;s still the minority and a declining one at that. <br><br>The Pew Research Center&#039;s statistics show that atheism is expected to continue to decline all the way into 2050 with a continued growth of religion. Other research also shows a huge surge in growth for Christianity in China which is currently the world&#039;s most &quot;atheist&quot; nation because of the atheist communist government suppressing religion, the research suggests that China will soon become the world&#039;s most Christian nation within 15 years. <br><br>This is simply history repeating itself: Christianity prospered in Rome back in the ancient era when it was suppressed and it still grew in the militant atheist soviet Russia when it was suppressed there only a century ago with the majority of Russians today now also identifying as Christian.

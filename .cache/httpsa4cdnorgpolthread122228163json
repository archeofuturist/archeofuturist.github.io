We need to take a look at Trump and understand what has happened to him.<br><br>He&#039;s low energy, he is barely holding on to his campaign promises and dreams. I believe that he was genuine but he was also naive.<br><br>We do NOT live in a democracy. The role of the president is simply to sell us the policies of the deep state. Regardless of how wealthy and powerful you are they will get you. The establishment can not be fought from the inside. It will always be up to the people to save themselves.","filename":"potus","ext":".png","w":609,"h":286,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":117,"tim":1492830743199,"time":1492830743,"md5":"BnJbukbnw8ruIlZ3HHYcOw==","fsize":354481,"resto":0,"id":"XfxBvGUe","country":"AU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"trump-is-no-longer-president","country_name":"Australia","replies":11,"images":0,"unique_ips":10},{"no":122228451,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)23:15:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122228163\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122228163<\/a><br>Libya is a No Man&#039;s Land.

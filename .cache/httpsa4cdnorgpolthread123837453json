Against both the decadent consumerism of capitalism and the moral philosophical void of communism, which ignores unique and pure cultures, he proposes a system of mutual aid, charity and love for the people of one&#039;s nation, alongside faith and devotion to God (although some legionaries were not Romanian Orthodox). Codreanu was murdered under orders from the King, Carol, who considered the Iron Guard a threat to his rule. In the end the Guard did come to power, under Marshal Ion Antonescu, but he was deposed by the very same King in 1944 in a bid to win favour with the Allies towards the end of the Second World War. <br><br>Let&#039;s discuss the Iron Guard and the legacy of Codreanu&#039;s thought.","filename":"IMG_2223","ext":".jpg","w":900,"h":700,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":194,"tim":1493767824087,"time":1493767824,"md5":"MZZNQnKrfYEHGgPppWRhXg==","fsize":217859,"resto":0,"id":"QFodIktx","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"what-does-pol-think-of-codreanu","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":7,"images":1,"unique_ips":4},{"no":123837817,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)19:33:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"Translation of the song - I&#039;m not Romanian, I have a reasonable grasp of it and I am a Literature student who speaks French and Italian, so I&#039;ve tried my best to render it lyrically while maintaining the meaning.

Why would someone who is Chinese or Russian bother with risking their lives to leak secret information to a foreign group? Now, you could argue that the information could be useful in some way to the west. Okay, but look at it the other way: what if there&#039;s a Chinese Wikileaks, all in Chinese, and you just decide to leak to it secrets about the west. So what? China isn&#039;t gonna care. Their people sure as fuck ain&#039;t gonna care. It only makes sense if the information you leak is showing the atrocities or negligence of your own government in order to effect change. Leaking Chinese, Russian or whatever secrets through wikileaks will have a marked reduction in any value to anyone. The reason why Wikileaks has information on the US mainly is because it asserts itself as the world&#039;s policeman and has the most influence in the world. As the world&#039;s policeman, it should not expect any degree of secrecy, especially when local police forces are required to be open and accountable.","filename":"1291497876256","ext":".jpg","w":792,"h":726,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":114,"tim":1492734185436,"time":1492734185,"md5":"y8k6cPCx7uNEcKkx\/C7v1g==","fsize":372579,"resto":122053585,"id":"+owXp3sG","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122069145,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)20:24:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122058646\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122058646<\/a><br>\/pol\/ has always hated BLUMPF and Assange and loved based musilm Assad<br><br>t. based oldfag since 2002<br><br>heil hitler!","filename":"1491764213732","ext":".jpg","w":717,"h":880,"tn_w":101,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492734293235,"time":1492734293,"md5":"+h\/g4vY\/JR9phLhzfh37Gg==","fsize":90615,"resto":122053585,"id":"4Jaqj\/\/y","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122069150,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)20:24:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122056174\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122056174<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;This guy is anti-American scum who undermines our military operations and puts soldiers in danger<\/span><br><br>What page of the propaganda booklet is this on?","time":1492734295,"resto":122053585,"id":"+owXp3sG","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122069382,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)20:26:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122069145\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122069145<\/a><br>Anon pretending to be a shill pretending to be anon pretending to be a shill pretending to be anon.<br>It&#039;s so deep.","time":1492734419,"resto":122053585,"id":"FN4wLjvA","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":122069395,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)20:27:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122069150\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122069150<\/a><br>17","time":1492734424,"resto":122053585,"id":"7RtxCpHs","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122069410,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)20:27:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122068264\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122068264<\/a><br>My ancestors are with me.","time":1492734430,"resto":122053585,"id":"V1RPyBZL","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":122069763,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)20:30:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122069410\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122069410<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;JULIAN ASSANGE TO BE ASSASSINATED<\/span><br>Ftfy","time":1492734617,"resto":122053585,"id":"4os7Ptxu","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122069868,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)20:31:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122069382\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122069382<\/a>","filename":"jews-did-911-1","ext":".jpg","w":765,"h":343,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":56,"tim":1492734672102,"time":1492734672,"md5":"Bb3hBzY4xs7oHMRfYIQK8A==","fsize":80100,"resto":122053585,"id":"liQAYINV","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122069873,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)20:31:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"I thought he was dead.","time":1492734675,"resto":122053585,"id":"ONdjo6aO","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122069964,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)20:32:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122053585\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122053585<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Checks source <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;CNN<\/span>","filename":"1492648435001","ext":".jpg","w":689,"h":517,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1492734725065,"time":1492734725,"md5":"OXZOC5RwgdnL2eU8cHONog==","fsize":104857,"resto":122053585,"id":"e5yC5F6f","country":"JP","country_name":"Japan"},{"no":122070047,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)20:32:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122053585\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122053585<\/a><br>The good ones always get taken out.","filename":"1486071569115","ext":".png","w":421,"h":416,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":123,"tim":1492734767341,"time":1492734767,"md5":"WOcngqBEA8xJf3FdeNpoHw==","fsize":115086,"resto":122053585,"id":"B0PIuqZP","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122070058,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)20:32:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122053585\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122053585<\/a><br>Wow the shills are getting ridiculous here.

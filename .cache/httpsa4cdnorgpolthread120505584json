To me, America looks a lot like the Byzantine Empire - a surviving half of the fallen Roman civilization which lasted for a thousand years and grew to be as great as Rome itself- a bastion against the world&#039;s darkness.<br><br>I think Europe is going to die, but that&#039;s not the same as giving in. A man can be surrounded, outnumbered, crippled, and still fight tooth and nail to the last. That&#039;s how I hope Europe goes down, realizing its mistakes and fighting the enemy even if it&#039;s too late to win.<br><br>And when the old nations die, as all nations someday do, the United States will live on, perhaps for a thousand years like Byzantium did. They will be different, of course, but in the end they will have the blood of old Europe in their veins. Their achievements will someday stand beside the achievements of Britain, Germany and France - an equal in the annals of history. <br><br>So yes, America is the greatest country on Earth, and will have to fight to remain that way. As for us, I hope someday history forgives our mistakes, and that now at the end we can go down fighting, true to the nations we once were.","filename":"aeneas leaves troy","ext":".jpg","w":473,"h":355,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1491865616650,"time":1491865616,"md5":"kuQ6UXa4yfc1GSc3ZpwZ1g==","fsize":55574,"resto":120505584,"id":"7+DAcWjj","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120508184,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)19:08:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"Europe is Judaism.<br>America is the successor of Judaism AKA Islam.","time":1491865697,"resto":120505584,"id":"ByejXtqs","country":"CH","country_name":"Switzerland"},{"no":120508430,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)19:10:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120505584\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120505584<\/a>","filename":"1471086342397","ext":".jpg","w":707,"h":1000,"tn_w":88,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491865813861,"time":1491865813,"md5":"zxI9VvxVnAKesEKz39RGnw==","fsize":192018,"resto":120505584,"id":"FjIdisic","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120508566,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)19:11:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120508430\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120508430<\/a><br>stupid weeb","time":1491865871,"resto":120505584,"id":"Z1nqNG+r","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

Trump&#039;s response was the best play he could come up with given his current circumstances. It&#039;s not masterstroke worthy but it allows him to recover and make a bit of breathing room after being under constant attack by enemies foreign and domestic since day 1 of his presidency. The advance warning to Russia will temper their response somewhat. If Putin catches on, he&#039;ll publicly express outrage and threats while silently maintaining the status quo. Syria loses an airfield, but it&#039;s not a sustained bombing campaign to take out their entire air force or preventing Russia from assisting them. <br><br>The only thing we should get from this is that the globalists are more dangerous than ever and need to be eliminated fast. This was a callous move because the Russians would also be monitoring the operation and would prevent any chem shells from being used if they still existed. ISIS was tunneling into Syria green zones and was likely stockpiling sarin at potential bombing sites. Two main suspects as to where they got it from: CIA or Mossad. It&#039;s probably the same batches that Assad turned over to UN\/OPCW inspectors back in 2014. Wouldn&#039;t be surprised if Obama\/HRC loyalist elements appropriated a few shells and funneled them to their ISIS stooges with Israeli help. If Assad was smart, he&#039;d have his people scouring the site for chem barrels and mortal shell fragments to get serial\/batch numbers and make a formal request to audit the records of the batches allegedly destroyed by OPCW.

I&#039;ve been thinking about trying to infilitrate antifa organisations in order to leak information and weaken their effectiveness. <br><br>Has anyone else here done this? I have no real digital footprint so am not worried about being found out but I&#039;m not sure how best to infilitrate and weaken them","filename":"1491813552228","ext":".jpg","w":1250,"h":1250,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491833116505,"time":1491833116,"md5":"xaaAI7+4ZyAHyuwyrNwwNw==","fsize":1124948,"resto":0,"id":"Q+vBhLsL","country":"AU","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"inflitrating-antifa","country_name":"Australia","replies":3,"images":0,"unique_ips":4},{"no":120441428,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)10:08:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"moonman&#039;s jewish and has a black missus","time":1491833325,"resto":120441127,"id":"+LP6yhJG","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":120441602,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)10:10:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120441127\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120441127<\/a><br>did the dingos eat your library?

Push whatever agenda they push but ten times harder. Follow their ideology to it&#039;s logical conclusion. Think the Draft Our Daughters campaign. The idea will be something they won&#039;t turn away, enough of them will be dumb enough to latch on to it and promote it, it will make them look ridiculous to normies and will send their agenda right over the cliff where it belongs.","time":1491833601,"resto":120441127,"id":"PJHRt98u","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

There is nothing wrong with a technocratic communist state. Less hours of work, free housing and living. Soros has been working towards this despite the board going echo chamber mode when he is mentioned. The reality is it was going to happen anyway, he is just trying to get every nation into his planet. Universal, planetary peace. There does not have to be conflict at all. The only people who might be against it are hardcore racists. When race can be altered through genetic modification does race really matter?

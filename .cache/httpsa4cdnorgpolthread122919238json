For the first time in my life I bought <br>some anti-Semitic pamphlets for a few pennies. They all <br>started with the supposition that the reader already knew <br>the Jewish question in principle or understood it to a certain degree. Finally, the tone was such that I again had doubts <br>because the assertions were supported by such extremely <br>unscientific arguments. <br><br>I then suffered relapses for weeks, and once even for <br>months. <br><br>The matter seemed so monstrous, the accusations so <br>unbounded that the fear of committing an injustice tortured <br>me and made me anxious and uncertain again.&#039;&#039;","filename":"adolf-hitler-9340144-2-raw","ext":".jpg","w":281,"h":406,"tn_w":173,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493231850966,"time":1493231850,"md5":"tQArum31sGV7CdiBGjRr3w==","fsize":8271,"resto":0,"id":"aQSvNi8f","country":"LV","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"excerpt-from-mein-kampf","country_name":"Latvia","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

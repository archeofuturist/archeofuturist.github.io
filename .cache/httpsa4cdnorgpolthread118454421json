Jailing Hilary? They&#039;ve been friends for years. Travel ban? Doesn&#039;t affect the people funding ISIS or behind 9\/11. Trump also has a shit ton of money tied up in real estate there. Drain the swamp? The wealthy elite need the swamp just as much as alligators do. Trump&#039;s loyalty is to his wallet. Even his conservative staff won&#039;t be able to do much. They&#039;re just there as tokens to make conservatives happy. How&#039;s it feel to be the most cucked group on the internet? Please be honest, this is for science.","filename":"17498950_1342880332445890_7959447534160069519_n","ext":".jpg","w":480,"h":332,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":172,"tim":1490579672626,"time":1490579672,"md5":"9hZcMlkDaiOrwfYHvMtAYg==","fsize":22982,"resto":0,"id":"MqNCTddx","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"yall-got-got-cucked-there-was-never-any-chance","country_name":"United States","replies":10,"images":4,"unique_ips":10},{"no":118454538,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)21:55:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118454421\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118454421<\/a><br>You had a gay as fuck thread yesterday, lets discuss my custom meme instead","filename":"Untitled2","ext":".png","w":510,"h":497,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":121,"tim":1490579728749,"time":1490579728,"md5":"3PrMm+WqAVu2wxQ0bv2XMA==","fsize":23827,"resto":118454421,"id":"kKEuoS0x","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118454651,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)21:56:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118454421\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118454421<\/a><br>nice retarded namefag, shill<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;\/reddit\/","time":1490579778,"resto":118454421,"id":"mkdA79YM","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118454685,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)21:56:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118454538\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118454538<\/a><br>These are quality memes","time":1490579796,"resto":118454421,"id":"FtwkGOWB","country":"PR","country_name":"Puerto Rico"},{"no":118454753,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)21:57:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118454538\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118454538<\/a><br>Your meme made me chuckle.

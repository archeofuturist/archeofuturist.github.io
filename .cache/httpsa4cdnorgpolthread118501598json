I&#039;m not asking in a \/g\/ related sense, but in a security related sense. With all the recent leaks of hardware and software backdoors it&#039;s really sounding like iOS is the better option for personal security. Though I&#039;ve used iOS in the past, I have loved Android since switching from the iPhone 5. I still like Android, and upgrade often but I do worry at times about the security of my device. Yet at the same time I like being able to do a bunch of extra shit like torrent on my phone, quick\/wireless charging, MicroSD, SamsungPay etc.<br><br><br>All memes aside, which would you pick? The one that offers more convenience, or the one that will safeguard your information.","filename":"maxresdefault (1)","ext":".jpg","w":2560,"h":1600,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":156,"tim":1490612867193,"time":1490612867,"md5":"56oYB9kGFb4NVYpYiBshEQ==","fsize":333840,"resto":0,"id":"LJwWjzxq","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"ok-pol-in-all-seriousness-which-one-is-the-better","country_name":"United States","replies":7,"images":0,"unique_ips":6},{"no":118501758,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)07:09:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118501598\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118501598<\/a><br>This still isn&#039;t \/pol\/ related.","time":1490612983,"resto":118501598,"id":"WExxoj48","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":118501863,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)07:10:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118501598\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118501598<\/a><br>both are shit and if you want real safety buy are chinese phone... they will steal all your informations like always but they will damn sure not give it to the enemy aka the usa","time":1490613059,"resto":118501598,"id":"CtOgE8\/g","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":118502161,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)07:14:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118501863\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118501863<\/a><br>Chink phones have been known to upload and send data to Chinese servers, whose to say they aren&#039;t just selling your info to the highest bidder?

Motorola and LG were good phones, but their customer service was severely lacking which lead me away from them. I&#039;m currently with Verizon which uses outdated CDMA for calls so many unlocked GSM phones are not an option. I&#039;ve been happy with my S7 because it&#039;s on an unlocked\/no bloat firmware etc. Again though, there&#039;s the issue of how secure can it really be if anyone can literally just tap into the information on my phone under the right circumstances? <br><br>I also like the anti-niggering options on iOS devices where you literally can&#039;t unlock them at all without the original iCloud account.

Narrow Remain constituency because it was lumped in with north Liverpool vote othewise would have voted Leave and decent underlying UKIP vote in 2015 so possible he could be easily removed by encouraging tactical voting.<\/span><br><br>North Norfolk - Norman Lamb - Maj. 4,043 <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Tories main contender.

Not an official marginal seal but historically a Lib Dem seat or LD\/Lab marginal, if their pre-2015 vote returns she loses her seat. Main prize for us if we can get it. Most prominent feminist and SJW in Parliament. SJW fringe within Labour are trying to rally round to protect her as a future leadership choice.

The US has been making stink face at NK for 67 years because NK is another war the US failed to win. Technically the war is still under an extended uneasy ceasefire. So the renewed rhetoric is for.<br>(1) The US has to keep North and South apart or it&#039;ll look like a bigger failure if they can get along. There&#039;s a strong political opposition now that wants to reunite under what&#039;s known as the &quot;Sunshine Agreement.&quot; <br>(2) Owning the south as a vassal through &quot;body guard services&quot; gives the US a base of influence in that region.<br>(3) You can&#039;t retool a military and sell weapons without enemies.<br>(4) The Taliban eradicated opium production in Afghanistan in 2002. Then US takes over and production explodes (CIA). Globally now lots of cheap heroine, and opiate production goes through the roof. Also a part to play in all that drug wealth is Jung-UN stopped opium production in NK early in his administration. Recently, because it&#039;s a cash crop, and NK needs the money due to the sanctions and embargoes, and to pay for their new missile program, they started producing opium again. They are a huge opium producer. The problem?? North Korea opium, unlike the Afghanistan opium, is not under the control of the CIA. It&#039;s a competitor that drives down prices and profits from Afghan opium. They&#039;re cutting in on the CIA opium action.<br><br>So now we have Pence saying that there will be no talks with NK! All the US wants is that NK is dismantling their ballistic nuclear missile, just because! He&#039;s really saying, &quot;how dare they make weapons to deter an invasion!&quot; NK radio is even saying they need the nukes to deter invasion of the US under false pretenses (Iraq).<br><br>The US gov couldn&#039;t give two shits about NK nukes. Many other nations have them, some unregulated like Israel. Any country that launches a nuke at the US is going to turn into a giant green glowing glass parking lot. Countries want them to deter from unstable US bullshit invasions for the owners of the US.","filename":"G0540_16X-Datawatch-Sat","ext":".png","w":591,"h":439,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":185,"tim":1492664864566,"time":1492664864,"md5":"k9iCISiugN2lQJAi23XoXQ==","fsize":12393,"resto":0,"id":"TlDqGIQI","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"on-north-korea","country_name":"Canada","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

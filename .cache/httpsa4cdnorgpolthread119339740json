Halfway through the fiscal year, the U.S. has already taken in 39,082 refugees... If the 900 per week number holds through the remainder of the fiscal year it would mean the Trump administration would bring in 62,482 refugees for fiscal 2017...<br><br>While far lower than the 110,000 that Obama had wanted... [It&#039;]s not a historically low number... just barely under the per-year average of 64,000 since 2002.<br><br>...[T]rump\u2019s new target number of 62,480 refugees for 2017 falls right in line with annual totals brought in by ... Bush and even several years under ... Obama...<br><br>[T]he Bush Administration was below the Trump target number in 2002, 2003, 2006, 2007 and 2008.<br><br>Even Obama was below that number in 2011 and 2012<br><br>* Edit: The cap will revert because of the recent court rulings; the story seems to slant towards blaming Trump for his plan. In fact, it is a result of the court rulings, and no visible response to the rulings thus far from the Trump administration and State Department","filename":"5","ext":".gif","w":310,"h":760,"tn_w":50,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491235300586,"time":1491235300,"md5":"h+aH+VmU9oWVHCdJZc+4IQ==","fsize":23774,"resto":119339740,"id":"NKf3fLtQ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119343398,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)12:01:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"well3<br><br>http:\/\/archive.is\/v7aMd","time":1491235319,"resto":119339740,"id":"YyyFAEs0","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119343410,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)12:02:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;legislators bitching about judges when it&#039;s the legislators&#039; job to change the laws if they don&#039;t like them<\/span><br><br>really activates the almonds","time":1491235327,"resto":119339740,"id":"maF+RFm1","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119343427,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)12:02:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119343062\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119343062<\/a><br>I don&#039;t know Anon why is Obama hiding out in Tahiti ( an non extradition country) and has been totally Silent on this?","time":1491235335,"resto":119339740,"id":"oJaBsmqY","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119343437,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)12:02:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119343271\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119343271<\/a><br>Technically, that guy is correct.

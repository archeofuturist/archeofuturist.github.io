We were having a real good time, he brought some reefer and I was dressed up, it was like he saw me as a real woman. <br>So I&#039;m in the kitchen cooking some eggs (scrambled) when I hear the front door open and then a loud &quot;what the fuck&quot;<br>I ran into the living room and my dad was back, and the look in his face was the most hateful thing I&#039;ve ever seen in my life. John was gone in half a second so at least he was safe, but my dad beat the living shit out of me and physically there me out the door and said that if I ever showed my face around there again he would kill me. <br>So I&#039;m homeless right now can someone give me a place to stay if the cops find me they&#039;ll kill me haha","filename":"63649247-2DF3-492C-811B-40AD3CA438DF-3691-0000084D5049B2E8","ext":".jpg","w":407,"h":540,"tn_w":94,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493889947051,"time":1493889947,"md5":"cHc0qPPCwZGiN7Axv+U4Mg==","fsize":52105,"resto":124039230,"id":"mImzFQGz","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124042407,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)05:26:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"Hey there kids!

Hard work is hard work, but it is a million times more worth it when you have a community of people you know and love. Doing things with your family was sacred. The people you started kindergarden with are the people you graduate and work with. You go on vacations with other peoples families. Things like tresspassing werent a big deal because you knew everyone. My dad walked around with .22 rifles and shot shit for fun, and explored out in the woods with his friends. <br>It was an entirely different world. It had its own draw backs, but today is so much worse objectively.<br>Small example: take a look at how sweet old ladys are. That was the environment back then. The society bred those women. Now look at women today. Im not joking when I say I only have one friend that is a girl and still a virgin before marriage. Women today dont have the same sweetness they once did. Atleast not the majority of them.<br><br>Maybe I am romantisising it a bit but damnit I can want something better for my children cant I?","time":1493889970,"resto":124039230,"id":"7SekdzMm","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124042520,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)05:27:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124042407\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124042407<\/a><br>No, daddy told me not to hangout around with strange people.","time":1493890069,"resto":124039230,"id":"Lh53bUZc","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124042536,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)05:28:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124042278\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124042278<\/a><br>I work not too far from where the video was set...how different.

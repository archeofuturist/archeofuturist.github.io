Hard work is hard work, but it is a million times more worth it when you have a community of people you know and love. Doing things with your family was sacred. The people you started kindergarden with are the people you graduate and work with. You go on vacations with other peoples families. Things like tresspassing werent a big deal because you knew everyone. My dad walked around with .22 rifles and shot shit for fun, and explored out in the woods with his friends. <br>It was an entirely different world. It had its own draw backs, but today is so much worse objectively.<br>Small example: take a look at how sweet old ladys are. That was the environment back then. The society bred those women. Now look at women today. Im not joking when I say I only have one friend that is a girl and still a virgin before marriage. Women today dont have the same sweetness they once did.

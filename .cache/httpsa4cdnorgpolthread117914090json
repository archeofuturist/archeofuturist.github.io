I was fine to believe this because I never had any real contact with true blacks. I was told my race would slowly become a minority then disappear. I was fine with this, because I assumed that the black man was just like me and like me I wouldn&#039;t hold any abuse any race. I was told many things. I would accept many things, because I never had to deal with much of the consequences and never taught to think of them rationally. I long for the days in which I could say in all honestly that &quot;the world&#039;s future is looking bright.&quot; <br>But things have changed, I have now lived in majority black neighborhoods. Been to schools where I was an incredible minority. I have come to realize that what I have been told is a lie. I have seen the truth both in daily life and in statistics. I now see what is in store for the world. The Aryan race -hitherto unmatched in its contributions to the advancement of man- is killing itself. Not in the Objectivist sense of the term, but in its Greek sense, Atlas is shrugging. Within the past two centuries we have seen great technological advancements, but our culture and ethics seem to dwindle. And now we have reached the tipping point. We have reached the point to which we have lost all touch with reality. We have learned well how to survive, but have forgotten why we should strive to do so. And now we sink our heads in despondency and race towards the abyss. <br>If the Aryan race dies, then the world will fall into a darkness from which it shall never find its way out.","filename":"main-qimg-c90d09232b59095500fb8587834d45cf-c","ext":".jpg","w":350,"h":205,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":146,"tim":1490262862398,"time":1490262862,"md5":"kO8ktOv+LL6HcFR0W31mPg==","fsize":18111,"resto":0,"id":"A51zHZ12","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"atlas-is-shrugginga-reflection-on-the-state-of","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

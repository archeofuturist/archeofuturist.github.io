Otherwise it wouldn\u2019t have prompted a reaction. However, with the first assumption we have to assume that you care about having an argument but simply couldn\u2019t deliver at that moment. This would suggest you believe your opinions have a rational basis, which most people do in political discussion. It also suggests that usually you want to rationally explain why you believe in something.<br><br>What is most interesting is the second case however. If you believe that counterarguments are not meaningful for you, it seems you\u2019re driven by something irrational, likely by emotion. Some research would suggest all political opinions are ultimately based in emotion, however, some political opinions can be backed by assumptions drawn from facts. If you don\u2019t care about facts, you\u2019re driven by some animal instincts, like an early human being afraid of a bush rattling in the wind, having no explanation to what happens.<br><br>When you reply \u201ccuck\u201d, there are two options. You\u2019re either out of arguments or you have a lizard brain.","filename":"bTzw5tM","ext":".jpg","w":2000,"h":1333,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1493120631062,"time":1493120631,"md5":"MdScSMQcliuY5g1HG\/tcTA==","fsize":256583,"resto":0,"id":"d1H111Gk","country":"NL","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"a-thought-experiment","country_name":"Netherlands","replies":2,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":122726420,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)07:59:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122725233\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122725233<\/a><br>don&#039;t you have a better things to do?

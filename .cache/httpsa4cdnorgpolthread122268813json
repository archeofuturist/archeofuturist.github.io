They&#039;re greedy and lazy and as long as people support them it will keep getting worst. Gaben doesn&#039;t offer anything to society at this point, he actually hurts society because he hoards money that he&#039;ll never use and when rich people do that the economy stagnates. So I think it&#039;s perfectly fair to have the rich (or some rich like the example of gaben) be taxed more to keep the money moving.","time":1492878537,"resto":122268813,"id":"XsIIAICw","country":"GR","country_name":"Greece"},{"no":122295295,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)12:29:58","name":"Anonymous","com":";)","filename":"Screenshot_2017-04-22-16-30-35","ext":".png","w":720,"h":1280,"tn_w":70,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492878598135,"time":1492878598,"md5":"Vxmsh+jtqraSt9aWjyGrYw==","fsize":230700,"resto":122268813,"id":"50mfh7K\/","country":"IS","country_name":"Iceland"},{"no":122296128,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)12:38:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"Currently working on getting a view of \/pol\/&#039;s average political viewpoints according to 8values.

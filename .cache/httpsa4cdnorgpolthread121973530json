Just a bag of fur.<br><br>That&#039;s why liberals love cats and conservatives love dogs. Conservatives care about getting out and doing things in the real world.

When I&#039;m petting a dog I get no sign whether or not they enjoy it. When I pet a cat I get to see their tails straighten upright, they begin to purr, and croon their heads towards me so mark thier scent on me.<br><br>The other reason is I feel like you have to work for a cats trust and love, a dog just likes you or doesn&#039;t most of the time.<br><br>I have a 17 year old cat who follows me everywhere. I&#039;ve had her for as long as I can remember and I&#039;ve steeled myself off because I know she&#039;s going to die and break my heart.","filename":"image","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":960,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1492697338164,"time":1492697338,"md5":"2BuEFkEilWP1lrAtEaocLg==","fsize":270190,"resto":121973530,"id":"uSryQ38+","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":121998388,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)10:14:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121977129\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121977129<\/a>","filename":"bantifaggot","ext":".png","w":510,"h":489,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":119,"tim":1492697689564,"time":1492697689,"md5":"qrw5nHvbhLy30E0qiuJLmA==","fsize":11692,"resto":121973530,"id":"QweHpVth","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121998431,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)10:15:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121996298\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121996298<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;be mouse<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;flee oppression from wild animals<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;seek refuge inside this farmhouse <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;take resources and build myself a little nest inside this farmhouse to breed<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;some fucking shitlord doesn&#039;t want me to do this<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;wants to release a cat to kill me<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;thankfully, the shitlord is stopped by other humans who want to protect me while I suck up resources and breed and suck up more resources inside their farmhouse<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;eventually we mice take over the farmhouse and the humans leave<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;we don&#039;t know how to take care of the farmhouse and it eventually falls into shambles and disrepair<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;mice flee to find more farmhouses and repeat this for all eternity<\/span><br>Hmmmm really makes me ponder current events.","time":1492697713,"resto":121973530,"id":"mQwjI4O1","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121999948,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)10:32:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121996146\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121996146<\/a><br>kek","time":1492698768,"resto":121973530,"id":"x\/r3ktox","country":"PT","country_name":"Portugal"},{"no":122001502,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)10:49:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"I am one the right and I far prefer cats.","filename":"1485582831239","ext":".png","w":1280,"h":720,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1492699781198,"time":1492699781,"md5":"NX\/SbabX1GIzzJVLwbtpIQ==","fsize":1569176,"resto":121973530,"id":"4RojmKnP","country":"GB","m_img":1,"country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122003958,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)11:16:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121975377\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121975377<\/a><br>this","time":1492701382,"resto":121973530,"id":"h+vXDl0f","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":122004448,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)11:22:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121973530\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121973530<\/a><br>Dogs by far superior, however cats can be cool too.

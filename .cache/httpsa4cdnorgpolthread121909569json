That would lead people to go get the service done there and since they don&#039;t pay taxes there it would be &quot;free&quot;, though that is a minor issue which could be solved for instance issuing fees to those who are outside from the community that paid the taxes for it. So how does a community choose how the taxes get used, is it by a case by case agreement where the majority makes the decision or will there be some sort of compromise if there is no clear majority?

And, the district claims that it&#039;s the first public school system nationwide to make the switch.<br><br>The new maps replace the traditional, rectangular maps made using the 16th-century Mercator Projection method that was introduced back when Europe ruled \u2014 and exploited \u2014 much of the world. Mercator world maps emphasize the colonial-era Atlantic Ocean trade routes and distort the relative sizes of continents so that, for example, Greenland appears to be bigger than Africa. (It&#039;s not.)<br><br><br>Other distortions inherent in the Mercator Projection display a kind of territorial superiority. Simply put, predominantly-white countries are huge seeming, while nonwhite-majority countries are rather small, in comparison.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;muh global map projection oppression

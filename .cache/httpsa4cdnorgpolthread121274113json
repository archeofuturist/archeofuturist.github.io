Even if you&#039;re stuck for time, most of this shit can be done in a slow cooker too and those only cost about 20 quid. Buy a sack of rice too.

I set the price at \u00a3100. This is way overpriced, but people are buying it this price on ebay for some reason.<br><br>I got a response from someone. He&#039;s asking if I would consider swapping it with the following:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Intel i5 - 4460 <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;A motherboard which he didn&#039;t specify<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;8 GB of corsair xms ram<\/span><br><br>This is quite a bad deal for him. All of these components together could easily be sold for at least \u00a3200. I asked him why he wants to trade all this. Asked if he&#039;s upgrading to his whole PC including CPU.<br><br>He responded with:<br><br>&quot;Yes m8 got i7 processor shop built it and gave me board back.&quot;<br><br>For non-autists in here, basically he&#039;s wasting his money. Fucking up all over the place. Going with an i7. Even upgrading his CPU in the first place. Getting it done through a shop apparently (probably one of those paki computer shops). And then not only that, this overpowered CPU will be completely wasted if he goes with the card I&#039;m selling.

I dunno, it just feels slimy as fuck man. I feel like I should be telling this guy he&#039;s getting ripped off and I should give him some advice instead. When I was in Primary School, at one point everyone was obsessed with Chinky Pokemon cards. A younger boy a couple of years below me wanted to join in on the fad, and one day he brought in a Charizard card without realising how rare it was. I convinced him to swap it with my shit tier basic bitch Diglett card. I&#039;ll always remember that, because it made me feel incredibly guilty.","filename":"kh","ext":".jpg","w":599,"h":960,"tn_w":77,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492297270329,"time":1492297270,"md5":"OByvj27UzFeDLwdoUG0uUg==","fsize":31392,"resto":121274113,"id":"j6iarBk1","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121276000,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)19:01:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121275486\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121275486<\/a><br>Mike Pence?","time":1492297295,"resto":121274113,"id":"D7BRskUt","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121276062,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)19:02:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121275884\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121275884<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;all that basic fucking math<\/span><br><br>Jesus Christ, thoroughly embarrassing.","time":1492297326,"resto":121274113,"id":"r7bHJhBN","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121276093,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)19:02:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121274910\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121274910<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121275172\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121275172<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121275486\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121275486<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Le ebin blackbill :)))<\/span><br><br>Babbys first parliamentary mid term polling?

She was leaving the country, we had a party, there was an argument I backed down from. She went to bed but asked me to wake her when I left so we could say a proper 1on1 goodbye. So I woke her up at 6am and we talked while waiting for my lift, my mate snoring so loudly in the living room I couldn&#039;t sleep anyway. She actually said &quot;Sorry about [the argument] earlier. I guess I got kinda brainwashed at uni&quot;.<br><br>I think she realised she was saying what she was saying because she learnt to in uni in order to have a group of friends.<br><br>tl;dr: lots of people realise that the X-Y-Z of SJW is utter and total bollocks, but they do it out of fear for being ostracised. <br><br>Imagine. You don&#039;t wanna be with SJW who are seen as &#039;acceptable and normal&#039; in society. But you don&#039;t want to join the &#039;NAZI RACIST BIGOTS&#039; even though they&#039;re nothing of the sort because society says &#039;they&#039;re bad and evil and should DIE&#039;. So you go with the &#039;left&#039; and you hang around so long with a one sided argument you start believing it. Nobody in the group ever goes &quot;Look at these stats&quot; or whatever. It&#039;s always &quot;DEM DAM RAYCISS HURT MAH FEE FEES&quot;.<br><br>I honestly can say I toed the SJW line for a few years even if I didn&#039;t agree with it.

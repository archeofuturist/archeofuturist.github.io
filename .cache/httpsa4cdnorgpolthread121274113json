What I do is cook up a big batch of stuff on a Sunday, split it into tubs and freeze it. That way you have a bunch of ready meals that will last you for ages. Even if you&#039;re stuck for time, most of this shit can be done in a slow cooker too and those only cost about 20 quid. Buy a sack of rice too.

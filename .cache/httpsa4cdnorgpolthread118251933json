There is such hospitality during Ramadan. That said, your uncle is wrong. The reality is almost the direct inverse. <br><br>The EU has made significant financial and political investments in Tunisia. They&#039;ve removed most tariffs on Tunisian goods with the Association Agreement and have been actively involved in raising Tunisian productivity so that they can better compete on the global market.

I won&#039;t pretend to know everything about it, but it seems to me that there&#039;s been governmental mismanagement that has led to ballooning foreign debts in the past.

I just looked it up, and Tunisian adults work an unusually high number of hours per week. It really seems that whatever education your youth may be getting, it&#039;s not making them particularly attractive to employers.

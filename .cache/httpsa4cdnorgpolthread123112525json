Judge Madeline Haikala of the U.S. District Court in Birmingham ruled that the city of Gardendale\u2019s effort to break away was motivated by race and sent messages of racial inferiority and exclusion that \u201cassail the dignity of black schoolchildren.\u201d She also found that Gardendale failed to meet its legal burden to prove that its separation would not hinder desegregation in Jefferson County, which has been struggling to integrate its schools since black parents first sued for an equal education for their children in the 1960s. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Still, Haikala ruled Monday that Gardendale may move forward with the secession, basing her decision in part on sympathy for some parents who want local control over schools and in part on concern for black students caught in the middle.<\/span><br><br>https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/loca<wbr>l\/education\/judge-says-mostly-white<wbr>-southern-city-may-secede-from-its-<wbr>school-district--even-though-the-ef<wbr>fort-has-attacked-dignity-of-black-<wbr>school-children\/2017\/04\/26\/4d654232<wbr>-2a89-11e7-b605-33413c691853_story.<wbr>html?utm_term=.7a68a7f437d1#comment<wbr>s<br><br>What do you think of this?<br>Is this the beginning of the South trying to rise again or are people just fed up with race bull-shit around the country?<br>Is AL tired of black people ruining their schools??<br>Do you think this could catch on in other southern states and\/or elsewhere in the nation?","filename":"alabama","ext":".png","w":1112,"h":940,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":211,"tim":1493337252141,"time":1493337252,"md5":"PqQdFEoxv9jADashqu9yuA==","fsize":1498057,"resto":0,"id":"zBwOuruz","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"meanwhile-in-alabama","country_name":"United States","replies":6,"images":0,"unique_ips":4},{"no":123112726,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)19:55:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"Good.

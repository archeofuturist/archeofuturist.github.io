Essentially he hypothesized that nothing that makes men and women different socially comes from biological sex, it&#039;s all due to upbringing and socialization. Read up on the David Reimer case. A boy who lost his penis in a ((botched circumcision)) became Money&#039;s test subject. He was castrated, and had a series of other operations, and was treated as a girl. Strangely enough, none of that training &#039;took&#039; and he ended up killing himself as an adult.","time":1493148565,"resto":122768199,"id":"LpHyGs1i","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]}

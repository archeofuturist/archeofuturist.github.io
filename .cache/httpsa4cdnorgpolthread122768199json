The word gender originally described only a grammatical concept.<br>2. Feminists in the 60s - 80s started using the word &quot;gender&quot; to refer to the social system that assigned different roles to women and men based on their sex (&quot;sex roles&quot;). They did not use &quot;gender&quot; as something that people &quot;have&quot;.<br>3. (((Judith Butler))) releases the book &quot;Gender Trouble&quot; in 1990. In it she proposes that gender is a performance and an internal identity, not a system. This is one of the most influential books in all of feminism. People start using the word &quot;transgender&quot; beginning in 1990 (check Google ngrams)<br>4. Julia Serano (a man) releases a book &quot;Whipping Girl&quot;, further advancing the &quot;gender as identity&quot; argument as well as arguing that &quot;sex&quot; is not really valid. Also an influential book.<br><br>The notion that people &quot;have a gender&quot; is an invention of third-wave feminism. The notion that &quot;sex&quot; and &quot;gender&quot; are &quot;synonymous&quot; is an anachronistic response to third-wave feminism and very recent. Before the 90s BOTH feminists and regular people only referred to people as having a &quot;sex&quot; which is either male or female.","time":1493149270,"resto":122768199,"id":"irDWfxYm","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":122776315,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)15:45:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122774853\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122774853<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;Like, who is hurt by not going to one bathroom over the other?<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;That&#039;s a very good question.

We are heavily reliant on primary sector economies that fall victim to a boom\/bust cycle. Since the creation of the pipeline in 77\/78, 91-92% of our state budget has come from oil royalties\/taxes. We need the protection of the US geopolitical sphere, as much as I dislike to admit it. I&#039;m no fan of proposals such as pebble mine and that ilk, but if we want to rid ourselves of the federal teat we must work with what we have. I agree that the fed controls entirely too much of our land, but we must kowtow if we want to save ourselves in the here and now.","time":1490077916,"resto":117583751,"id":"vkxqe1xE","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117597454,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)02:34:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117597296\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117597296<\/a><br>Step 1: Remove oil taxes entirely and raise royalties a little<br>Step 2: Nullify EPA rules","time":1490078052,"resto":117583751,"id":"KyRalmxF","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117597630,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)02:36:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"It&#039;s shorter distance than I drive to uni.<br><br>How long would it take Russia to completely conquer Canada?","time":1490078219,"resto":117583751,"id":"PwIgaH2M","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":117597689,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)02:37:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117597630\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117597630<\/a><br>Alaska would stop it in its tracks.<br><br>Assuming they could break through that line, not very long","time":1490078271,"resto":117583751,"id":"KyRalmxF","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117597964,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)02:41:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117597689\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117597689<\/a><br>I&#039;m not talking about Alaska.

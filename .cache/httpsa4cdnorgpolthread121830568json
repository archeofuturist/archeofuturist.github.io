Their short term goal is to grow the available credit... In our current fiat system that means growing the population. This is because our currencies are no longer backed by resources (precious metals, land, etc); they are backed by the labour of a country&#039;s citizens.<br><br>Think of it like this: your country is now a giant farm, but instead of raising cattle they raise herds of sheep... I mean, people. A farm&#039;s potential profit would be limited by the number of cattle they have; therefore, a bank would give them a line of credit based on the size of their herd (as well as other things such as quality of cattle; i.e. a citizens education, age, or health).<br><br>As for their long term goal... Well, that&#039;s a little more complicated. Simply put, eventually those at the top will own everything, and in order to live you&#039;ll have to &quot;bend the knee&quot; to them. Imagine those factory cities in China. They give their workers a little room to live in and then force them to work 12 hour a day 7 days a week if they want to keep it... That is what we have to look forward to. There simply will be no other way to survive; they will have destroyed any way of life that does not benefit them.","time":1492600201,"resto":121830568,"id":"IO3Um0nK","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]}

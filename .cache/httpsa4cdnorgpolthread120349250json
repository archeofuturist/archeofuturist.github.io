No group or race are all the same, we can look at groups in a macro sense and pick out patterns of behavior we imbue to the whole as default. This is naturally acceptable and why Jews have such a poor reputation, that isn&#039;t in contradiction to understanding the individual and viewing them as such.<br><br>It just so happens that alot of the default Jewish behavior and philosophies are an anathema to Western Civilization and the White races. In fact, alot of it is pure poison, and no matter how much a Jew agrees with you, there&#039;s always seems to be a point at which the heeb curls drop and the hand rubbing begins.","time":1491781649,"resto":120349250,"id":"RAzQzqgM","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120358508,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)19:49:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120351432\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120351432<\/a><br>top kek","time":1491781744,"resto":120349250,"id":"CawRIz1K","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":120358761,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)19:51:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120351432\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120351432<\/a><br>How the fuck do you even find things like this, \/pol\/","filename":"1484725001298","ext":".jpg","w":1000,"h":784,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":98,"tim":1491781874389,"time":1491781874,"md5":"9lYGC3n6vbEV3kN5fp+M7Q==","fsize":283777,"resto":120349250,"id":"HK+rOl9W","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120359223,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)19:55:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120353975\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120353975<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Anti-Faggots<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Pro-Faggots<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Anti-Immigration<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Pro-Immigration<\/span>","time":1491782109,"resto":120349250,"id":"Wn4mdXx9","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":120359574,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)19:58:01","name":"SAGE","com":"<a href=\"#p120349250\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120349250<\/a><br><br>Ex CIA today<br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=YNt<wbr>sQmwas5k","time":1491782281,"resto":120349250,"id":"gsDtfVLw","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120359659,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)19:58:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120349250\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120349250<\/a><br>honestly, i voted for trump, but honestly lie after lie for like 3 months. syria is the straw that broke the camel&#039;s back. im struggling to find a reason to stay on the train, but right now i feel like ive been conned.","filename":"1491274320647","ext":".jpg","w":1214,"h":1140,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":117,"tim":1491782327331,"time":1491782327,"md5":"JayWcMw0xjOzRYFa9ZrPUw==","fsize":75170,"resto":120349250,"id":"gqjy4CcE","country":"CA","m_img":1,"country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120359979,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)20:01:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120359574\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120359574<\/a><br>interesting commentary","time":1491782471,"resto":120349250,"id":"c4AIAbus","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120359991,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)20:01:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120349250\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120349250<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;politico reporter lurks \/pol\/ for a run of the mill hit piece<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;ends up getting redpilled<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;goes full poltard and reveals newly found power level<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;names the jew<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;gets called up by HR<\/span><br><br>lel","time":1491782478,"resto":120349250,"id":"izO7qDlg","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120360147,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)20:02:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120359991\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120359991<\/a><br>Not only the reporter but most likely the publishers visit \/pol\/.

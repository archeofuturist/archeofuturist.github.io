Theres one incisive example for such a inconsestent system: The Republic of Weimar (Weimarer Republik). The RW was democratic to its core, up to the point where it allowed even its most radical enemies to participate in elections.

The reasons for the antidemocratic urge within society are diverse, the most important I would say is human nature itself, since all democracies are in need of constant educational and pedagogical programs to form up a society of &quot;democratic citizens&quot; because every human being &quot;by nature&quot; simply isnt democratic but quite the opposite. <br><br>A dictatorship is a system that every human being understands right away, while a democratic system first needs to be taught and learned; its more abstract and thus less natural. Thats also the reason why you can be a good democrat and stupid as dogshit today, because our so-called democracy are in fact dictatorships and easy to understand. as long as you are tolerant, &quot;progressive&quot; and peaceful, you are a good democrat nowadays.<br><br>Pragmatic modern democrats had to learn that their ideology clearly contradicts to human nature. After WW2 the Americans exactly knew what they were doing: Setting up a democracy thats not a real democracy at all.<br><br>Democrats learned that its not the &quot;will of the people&quot; thats in their interest; its their own will, their own view on the world, their own beliefs and ideals that count. Democracy is nothing more than their way to fulfill these interests. For that they have to make sure that every oppositional group in society is locked out by law. Theres literally not a single chance to change the western systems on a politcal way. We have to realize that the modern democracies are not really democracies; they are covered plutocracies and oligarchies.<br><br>(continue)","time":1493212447,"resto":122882118,"id":"cNr0911h","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":122882189,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)09:14:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"Modern democracies are the most sophisticated regimes of all time. Modern rulers have the knowledge of 2000+ years; they have learnt that there is only one thing that will cause serious riots, and thats absence of power, hunger, extreme poverty and a lack of housing. They can lie and rip us off as much as they want, as long as our basic needs are fulfilled and as long as the police answers the call. As long as western states manage to fill our bellies and provide a solid amount of gibs, nothing will happen at all. at least hardline communists have the exact same problem. Idealists alone dont have the numbers to be a threat to a western gov. times have changed and its all about influencing the masses now.<br><br>since this system is becoming more fragile every year, something might happen in the future, but I doubt it.

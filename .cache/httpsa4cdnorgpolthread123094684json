But I don&#039;t think it&#039;s millennials&#039; fault if we&#039;re not spending enough time outside. It&#039;s partially the fault of our workaholic culture,&quot; Meyer said. &quot;When young people start a job that has two weeks of vacation, making only $31,000 a year but with $100,000 of student debt right out of college, you don&#039;t have time to go traveling to these places, even if they&#039;re only a day&#039;s drive away.&quot;<br><br>Meyer spent four years saving money for the trip and planning out the logistics of thousands of miles on the road.<br><br>He also spent those four years trying to pitch the trip to outdoors companies in order to pick up funding. Even though he was &quot;very out in [his] own life,&quot; he kept his sexual orientation a little more under wraps &quot;because the outdoor and travel industry is very heteronormative.&quot;<br><br>Meyer said, &quot;The only ads you see are gay people going to beaches and bars.&quot;<br><br>But from the day Meyer set out and started sharing his story, he started getting emails from queer park rangers, teenagers and 100-year-old men who told him, &quot;&#039;Thank you for doing this. We felt like our voices have never been heard before, but now, through your journey, we feel like our stories are being told,&#039;&quot; he said.<br><br>So Meyer threw financial caution to the wind and let loose his story as an out-and-proud young, gay Christian.","filename":"Screen Shot 2017-04-27 at 5.49.30 PM","ext":".png","w":1626,"h":1142,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":175,"tim":1493329884402,"time":1493329884,"md5":"LyLBknyS36cCfrmcp8BqYg==","fsize":1759430,"resto":0,"id":"8t6U1Il\/","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"does-pol-support-national-parks","country_name":"United States","replies":20,"images":1,"unique_ips":15},{"no":123095009,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)17:53:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;it&#039;s partially the fault of our workaholic culture<\/span><br>Why don&#039;t I see any niggers at Yellowstone then?","time":1493330015,"resto":123094684,"id":"R9yKPMzK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123095463,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)17:56:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123095009\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123095009<\/a><br>POC are excluded from representation in outdoor company advertisements and in movies about the outdoors so they don&#039;t think it is for them.","time":1493330174,"resto":123094684,"id":"8t6U1Il\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123095899,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)17:58:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123094684\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123094684<\/a><br>why the fuck does it matter if he is gay? baka just go to the fucking park and enjoy it nobody cares bout your sexuality weirdo, what are you doing in the woods? having homo orgies in your van or something?","time":1493330325,"resto":123094684,"id":"5VG04QTB","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123096213,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)18:00:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123095899\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123095899<\/a><br>Because its cool that he got funding from outdoor sports companies who usually appeal to a more heteronormative audience.","time":1493330444,"resto":123094684,"id":"8t6U1Il\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123096279,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)18:01:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123094684\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123094684<\/a><br>bump","time":1493330471,"resto":123094684,"id":"yblhg03s","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123096471,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)18:02:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123095899\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123095899<\/a><br>There was zero point to him being gain in terms of relevancy to the article.

Despite the memes and the rivalry, I decided to try out Reddit for a while. Been posting and lurking there for about a year now.<br><br>I&#039;ve been &quot;mostly&quot; happy with the experience, didn&#039;t see too much of the librul BS that I expected. Read enough subs that keep me occupied and stay away from obvious left leaning subs.<br><br>Fast forward to today, I finally found some. there was a post on \/r\/technology about the recent FCC ruling and I dared to make a right-wing comment about it. Hell, I was even agreeing with them on this point!<br><br>https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/technology<wbr>\/comments\/614z0r\/fyi_on_the_fcc_its<wbr>_always_the_democrats_who_fight\/<br><br>that&#039;s when it started. Downvotes, dozens of replies and no one to back me up. Should be pretty easy to find my posts.<br><br>Now look, I feel I am reasonably politically informed and up to date on current events (Conservative\/Libertarian leaning btw). That being said, having so many frankly well-worded responses and comments against me was a little disheartening. Not really because of what they were saying, but because I didn&#039;t know how to respond.<br><br>Did I do the right thing? I really don&#039;t want to delete the post and be looked at as a coward.<br><br>Any ideas?","filename":"","ext":".jpg","w":333,"h":187,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":140,"tim":1490378803659,"time":1490378803,"md5":"\/+FAIqc\/s9ab\/IuYOJHAJg==","fsize":5349,"resto":0,"id":"nLrf6NAL","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"where-op-dared-to-make-an-altright-comment-on","country_name":"United States","replies":11,"images":0,"unique_ips":11},{"no":118108463,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)14:07:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"BRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA<wbr>AAAAAAAAPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP<wbr>PPP","time":1490378857,"resto":118108386,"id":"3g0py1nJ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118108548,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)14:08:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118108463\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118108463<\/a><br>Excelent post","time":1490378914,"resto":118108386,"id":"7DQESQ6Y","country":"CL","country_name":"Chile"},{"no":118108811,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)14:11:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118108386\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118108386<\/a><br>So, you created the original post?

Also ancient greece where you had property that wasn&#039;t used for making money\/survival but for other reasons and actually trying to profit from them was punishable by death (Athen&#039;s olive trees that were only kept and picked for the purposes of religious rituals).<br>If you want to better understand how property can be personal (or belong to a group) but not be private read about the concept of embeddedness.<br><br>You don&#039;t even have to read much marxists literature (the manifest and marx&#039; early works are enough, around 200 pages or less) to see that marxist values are almost identical to christian values, except christians believed in paradise after this life, and communist believed you could achieve that on earth. Both kinda became inversions and simulations of themselves so that&#039;s similar too.","time":1491243328,"resto":119348736,"id":"OP27qVU+","country":"RS","country_name":"Serbia"},{"no":119359128,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)14:17:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;not a left wing Christian anarchist<\/span><br>Pfft","time":1491243459,"resto":119348736,"id":"b3dYCImu","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119359963,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)14:23:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119348849\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119348849<\/a><br><br>I think it&#039;s two cucks, taking turns cucking each other.","time":1491243803,"resto":119348736,"id":"QJZDxzVF","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119360296,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)14:25:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119349526\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119349526<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Muslim<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Libertarian<\/span><br><br>Get raked son.","time":1491243945,"resto":119348736,"id":"jHsoYgz6","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119362047,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)14:38:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119355447\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119355447<\/a><br>In Jesus time there clearly was employees and employers, in fact there was even slavery.

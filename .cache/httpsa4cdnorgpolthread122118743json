Morality is a human invention, designed to stabilize society in some senses, or to manipulate it by the less benevolent. The same as free will - we created the notion based on our sensory experience, so we could take credit and assign blame. But free will makes no logical sense in an interconnected universe.

But neurology has shown is that we are not consciously aware of our decisions until a split second after we&#039;ve arrived at them. But our brains reorder the events to fit our expectations. This goes for every living creature, including all our so-called leaders. We are all at the behest of nature itself, as natural processes, no different from the weather.

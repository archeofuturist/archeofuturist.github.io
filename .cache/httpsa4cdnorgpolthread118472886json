It&#039;s a fucking burden. I&#039;m studying at a top US research university (think Ivy League), and all it has done is exacerbate my introversion. I don&#039;t even want to talk to people anymore. In rare moments when I debate liberals, they can&#039;t even recognize that I&#039;m a conservative, traditionalist Trump supporter from the way I argue against globalism, mostly because they&#039;re in such a bubble that as long as I sound academic, they&#039;ll be unable to even conceive that I voted for Trump. They&#039;ll buy anything uncritically until it hits them later that it&#039;s the antithesis of the Obama doctrine. It&#039;s all very absurd and frustrating. I don&#039;t even know how to keep a poker face on anymore. I just instantly begin to seethe and grind my teeth when I hear people talking garbage, knowing how pervasive the mass delusion is and how readily people will try to ruin other people&#039;s lives over issues they personally care little about\u2014not enough to be intellectual honest, anyway.

I don&#039;t want out. I don&#039;t want to just cope. I want to THRIVE. I value the truth, but I also value raising a large family, making money, and contributing to society.

What they won&#039;t tell you about vaccines is that a small percentage of people have seizures or potentially HNGGGG, and they increase this risk by giving many shots at once so they can save $$$. The guy who started the vaccine thing had an undisclosed conflict of interest with solicitors looking to sue vaccine manufacturers and has been trying to convince himself he&#039;s not a crook ever since. Autism research is regularly hijacked by retards trying to reopen the issue of vaccines for the billionth time. Mercury poisoning itself isn&#039;t linked to autism which you would think it would be if mercury in vaccines were linked to autism.

There is less conclusive evidence it prevents cavities in adults. It may cause harms like fluorosis in a minority of the population. Water fluoridation probably saves countries money overall. It is questionable ethically to add it to the water supply due to consent issues.

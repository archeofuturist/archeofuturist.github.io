What was it like?<br><br>I just went to one yesterday, and everyone was a muslim, a ghetto black, and a Mexican. The only time I saw white people was at the counter at gamestop and police officers (It&#039;s really weird how all the cops were white but everyone in the mall was brown). What is with this? What the fuck? I&#039;m not sure if I was too young to notice as a kid, but this is crazy. Nobody in there was at all white and it&#039;s not an exaggeration. I couldn&#039;t even enjoy eating because a bunch of black guys (probably in their 30s) were screaming and dancing because a guy got cheated on by his girlfriend.<br><br>Tell me friends, what is your experience?","filename":"Empty","ext":".jpg","w":310,"h":162,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":130,"tim":1490554175957,"time":1490554175,"md5":"OHVXK1JZZF\/7+7jPOgCLkQ==","fsize":7074,"resto":0,"id":"PGycA7Hr","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"hey-guys-when-is-the-last-time-you-went-to-your","country_name":"United States","replies":3,"images":1,"unique_ips":3},{"no":118398501,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)15:00:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"Bump.","filename":"ME","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":360,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1490554849036,"time":1490554849,"md5":"LHI31WhGjM32BCw3hfz6lg==","fsize":101906,"resto":118397093,"id":"PGycA7Hr","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118399877,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)15:12:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118397093\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118397093<\/a><br>scary as fuck. <br><br>I&#039;ve got a toddler. We go to the indoor play area, which is full of muslims, the hijab bitches keep looking at us and whispering shit into their hub&#039;s ears, who all won&#039;t look at us. They glare. <br><br>There&#039;s a toy store sitting right above the play area. Its run by muslims. Could be anything in that storage room, yeah? <br><br>We go to see Santa.

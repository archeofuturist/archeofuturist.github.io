As a Sansei Japanese, this is outrageous to me. Not necessary bad as I considering myself a Japanese Nationalist, but this is crazy! These past few days I&#039;ve seen numerous Koreans and Koreanons respectively, openly supporting the Japanese Empire and demanding for the reestablishment of the Empire and Korean annexation. What the hell is going on? Does this have to do with the recent conflicts between the U.S and the Norks? Do they think the Japanese will provide protection? Do they believe their current government is inadequate?What gives, Korea?","filename":"18194612_1785111288378062_28785250060675464_n","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":960,"tn_w":166,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493794847444,"time":1493794847,"md5":"wqH0SAVYFxj3ufII0bW1Fw==","fsize":87998,"resto":0,"id":"15MPgzcw","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"im-so-fucking-confused-as-a-sansei-japanese-this","country_name":"United States","replies":25,"images":7,"unique_ips":19},{"no":123884784,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)03:04:10","name":"Is there some kinda Pro-Japanese movement happening amongst Koreans?","com":"Bump.

After the debacle with their government being controlled by a cult and North Korea&#039;s decades-long threats, many might see this as an opportunity to finally get away from the idea of the failed state of Korea altogether. Historically it&#039;s been a battleground because of its strategic position. Maybe people are tired of trying to pretend this works.

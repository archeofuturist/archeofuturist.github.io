You must be successful, reliable, hardworking, and, above all, happy. Do people in your life trust and respect you? What does your family think of you? Racial politics doesn\u2019t have to be the only factor of that. If you can\u2019t achieve these things in your real life, then you are probably wasting your time here.<br><br>Always remember: we live in first world countries and have opportunity that most people born on this planet don\u2019t. So work your ass off, every day, to build a good life for yourself. How can you help others when you can\u2019t help yourself? You can make more of a difference in this world by working on your real life, compared to what you can do by funposting here in the echo chamber. Spend your time wisely, and keep your real life priorities in order. Nothing on the internet should ever take away from your real life.","filename":"1455456491256","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":1024,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490997837257,"time":1490997837,"md5":"mAbaXuAYzCS9B2n6udCS4Q==","fsize":385416,"resto":0,"id":"\/d3+evLw","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-most-important-thing-you-can-do-for-the-white","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

D. Rankin in Celts and the Classical World notes that &quot;Athenaeus echoes this comment (603a) and so does Ammianus (30.9). It seems to be the general opinion of antiquity.&quot;[100] In book XIII of his Deipnosophists, the Roman Greek rhetorician and grammarian Athenaeus, repeating assertions made by Diodorus Siculus in the 1st century BC (Bibliotheca historica 5:32), wrote that Celtic women were beautiful but that the men preferred to sleep together. Diodorus went further, stating that &quot;the young men will offer themselves to strangers and are insulted if the offer is refused&quot;. Rankin argues that the ultimate source of these assertions is likely to be Posidonius and speculates that these authors may be recording male &quot;bonding rituals&quot;.","filename":"celtfags","ext":".jpg","w":400,"h":283,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":88,"tim":1490899608137,"time":1490899608,"md5":"hKp5c2kfJnZoIwavFksL+A==","fsize":72143,"resto":118945141,"id":"lZzmkgM8","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":118951904,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)14:47:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118950966\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118950966<\/a>","filename":"gauled","ext":".png","w":709,"h":561,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":98,"tim":1490899630339,"time":1490899630,"md5":"sKalSaD0+Ch84ZaDuXg8Rg==","fsize":1025422,"resto":118945141,"id":"lgwTr0DR","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118951946,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)14:47:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118951175\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118951175<\/a><br>nice, didnt know that<br><a href=\"#p118951438\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118951438<\/a><br>sure thing man, we wuz atlanteans.","time":1490899648,"resto":118945141,"id":"7PFnL\/KC","country":"HR","country_name":"Croatia"},{"no":118951981,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)14:47:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118945391\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118945391<\/a><br>t.

Lame.<br><br>Many of those cultures, especially like the Basque and Gaelic, tell stories of their race arriving in that land (where a more mystical race was already living) in boats from the sea. Atlantis was most likely on the Mid Atlantic Ridge, and just by looking at the currents it seems obvious that many survivors of the flood would have washed over to Western Europe. There are also random cultures in the Americas or on islands who share similar stories and sometimes end up having Aryan features- they could have easily been other Atlanteans who were washed out to sea ending up in random spots. Oh and of course, Egypt (whose people say that they were the Atlanteans) is right at the end of the Mediterranean where you can easily imagine strong currents pushing survivors. The Egyptians have plenty of cultural connections to Celtic history and the two groups literally share a ton of genes- I can&#039;t remember and would have to dig but I think I read some large percentage like 70% of British men share an Egyptian pharaoh ancestor? All of the things that Plato tell about Atlantis line up perfectly with the Mid Atlantic ridge. You can even see in the Odyssey that Odysseus is very clearly traveling the Atlantic and encountering lost survivors of Atlantis.

A pure vacuum, one with absolutely no particles, cannot exist in a universe that has matter, unless you make the &#039;vacuum&#039; small enough. The average density of interstellar space is roughly 1 hydrogen atom per 10 cubic centimetres. That&#039;s a pretty fucking amazing vacuum.","time":1492827016,"resto":122215250,"id":"vp7rpKZC","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":122220796,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)22:12:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"Yes, yes I do.<br><br>And Moon should be capitalized.","time":1492827126,"resto":122215250,"id":"SeI4KtPu","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122221535,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)22:17:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122215250\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122215250<\/a><br>They happened, we went there, come to peace with it.<br><br>Many people went.<br><br>Radio communications were picked up by professionals and hobbyists alike.

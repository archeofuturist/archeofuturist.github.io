I hate preppers, truly I do. One of the last exercises I did during my active service was to prepare for dumbass militias trying to loot walmart and kill people because of how fucking obnoxious and retarded they are. I literally fucking hate you if you think firearms and ammunition are important during a realistic crisis like a hurricane or some other nonsense. This is plain idiocy at it&#039;s finest, and some people will convince themselves that somehow America will concave into a third world country (even though it kind of is in some states) and fall victim to a non-stop warfare. <br><br>This is not a healthy train of thought, and many young gun owners I know buy into this lunatic shit and waste their time and resources into such an autistic hobby, which much to their dismay is not as retarded as anime but it might as well be. Utilizing the days of your life for preparing for something that may or may not happen is anti-social, and if continued as habit will eventually induce psychosis and do a number on your mental health. Being prepared is generally getting to know people around you and having friends which is a concept that might elude \/k\/ and 4chan in general. <br><br>Personally if shit goes south this is the perfect time to run a moonshine distillery operation with my buddies and turn a profit. Couple greenhouses full of weed and whatnot. The rest of you kiddos can have fun living a fantasy of being some sort of tactical survivor and getting shot by cops for trying to reign terror in a community of a bunch of nu-age liberal arts college kids that burn trash cans as symbols of anarchy.","filename":"airsoft vest operator","ext":".jpg","w":1200,"h":630,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":131,"tim":1493242658525,"time":1493242658,"md5":"KplJMkHZumudUVvDjQLUdw==","fsize":185385,"resto":0,"id":"LZHfvt\/g","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"because-even-reddits-ceo-is-a-fucking-idiot-that","country_name":"United States","replies":11,"images":0,"unique_ips":8},{"no":122943588,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)17:39:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122943353\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122943353<\/a><br>This thread had potential till you spilled your degenerate spaghetti all over it.","time":1493242765,"resto":122943353,"id":"wU4OT+kx","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122943791,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)17:40:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122943588\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122943588<\/a><br>Wtf are you talking about?","time":1493242857,"resto":122943353,"id":"LZHfvt\/g","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122944065,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)17:43:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122943353\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122943353<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;stop doing things i don&#039;t like<\/span><br>Anyway<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Personally if shit goes south this is the perfect time to run a moonshine distillery operation with my buddies and turn a profit.

Thinking STEM is superior because it gives you a potential for a better job is retarded. It&#039;s a desecration of science really, judging the value of something by how much money it will make you. STEM draws its value from its purity, the search for truth via the hypothetico-deductive scientific method. <br><br>I used to think that there were some relatively difficult subjects which deserve respect due to various reasons e.g. I used to think economics deserved a lot of respect because I didn&#039;t understand it much 10 years ago and I remember some of the advanced classes being almost identical to some of the applied mathematics courses I took e.g. in optimization, game \/ decision theory etc. Anyway, over the past few years I&#039;ve really been studying economics in my own spare time and while microeconomics is okay, it is completely divorced from reality. Macroeconomics is the real topic which studies the economy and it is pure garbage. No matter how many &quot;proofs&quot; or mathiness they involve in macro, it will always be a toilet subject, completely and utterly garbage. If anyone has not studied macroeconomics properly, it is one of the biggest joke subjects in existence, it&#039;s basically a subject held together by a bunch of unconnected models which have little proof. It&#039;s a joke... the entire basis of our economics understanding is based on macro and it&#039;s pure garbage. Admittedly, a lot of the new research is experimental\/quasi-experimental and there has been an empirical turn lately, but so much of what is taught is 100% garbage. <br><br>So if not economics what else? Economics is without doubt the most difficult and technical non-STEM subject. What else is worth studying which cannot be done in your spare time? Politics? Philosophy? <br><br>It&#039;s understandable that STEM majors are so arrogant. It&#039;s because every other subject is a joke compared to STEM. If not in difficulty, then in value.","time":1490131808,"resto":117672141,"id":"BHk\/GE32","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":117673267,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)17:30:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"Is it implying that feminists are children?","time":1490131832,"resto":117672141,"id":"7q9WMFa+","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":117673285,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)17:30:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117672141\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117672141<\/a><br>I&#039;m an &quot;asshole&quot; because I know my hard work and dedication is what&#039;s feeding all you lazy arts majors.","time":1490131841,"resto":117672141,"id":"uBIn9pLr","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":117673496,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)17:32:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"Because I get my ass kicked trying to solve quantum mechanics while people studying political science and economy talk about how hard life is trying to read a good night story before bed","time":1490131945,"resto":117672141,"id":"X7WiDWHh","country":"DK","country_name":"Denmark"},{"no":117673557,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)17:32:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117672141\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117672141<\/a><br>That is mainly the TE part of STEM.

My psychology background helped me not only with the human part of the business - negotiation especially - but allowed me to synthesize that knowledge beyond just &quot;I can do cars&quot; or &quot;I can paint pictures&quot; or &quot;I can fix your email&quot; and create a syncretic union of all of it.<br><br>My point is, none of this exists in a bubble.

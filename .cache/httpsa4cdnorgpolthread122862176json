It takes me 3 hours to travel from one edge of my territory to another and that is just north to south.<br><br>So, when I get a call for a job, it may be 2 hours away from home. Guess what? Looks like I am traveling.<br><br>I get paid great. I could honestly get paid more working independently. My hall makes having a job as simple as calling in to them. I call, they give me job, I drive 2 hours and beat things with hammers.","time":1493200077,"resto":122862176,"id":"+wgY3fHc","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122866940,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)05:54:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122866542\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122866542<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Unions should be forced to represent non-union workers for as long as unions prevented non-union workers from being employed.

Just because we have to offer them a job and representation, does not mean we cannot cram them into a 1st year apprentice class and pay them 50% of rate. They need to prove to US that they know the field before we have to pay them what they want. We can do this, and we will do this. We have done it in the past with &quot;applicants&quot; that we had to hire (i.e. hood-niggers). EVERY time this happens, the hood rat always gets fired. They are habitually late to work, and unprepared. They seem to think that unlaced timberlands are appropriate work attire. They hide from work throughout the day. <br><br>Every time Fired by the employeer. This gets back to the Hall, and it is off to the firing range. Very few people get fired AND keep their job.","time":1493200444,"resto":122862176,"id":"+wgY3fHc","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122867109,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)05:57:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122866542\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122866542<\/a><br>ok, so this is just about punitive measures against unions. well, at least you&#039;re off your high horse about muh markets","time":1493200657,"resto":122862176,"id":"0bWDpDXF","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122867219,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)05:59:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122866940\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122866940<\/a><br>RTW combined with mandatory union representation is a contradiction and an abomination.

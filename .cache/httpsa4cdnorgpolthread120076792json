Progressives told you over and over that Trump was conman but your baseless faith in him blinded to the obvious truth. Bernie was the only candidate for the job and you blew it. Assuming the world doesn&#039;t end in 2020, we can fix this. Set the muh socialism, muh commie, and muh bread lines memes aside, and join us in the resistance.<br>The left is not and never had been your true enemy. Purple haired tumblrfags,SJW protesters, gays, blacks, women, or whatever degenerate boogyman your targeting doesn&#039;t have the same political power as the wealthy oligarchs (which by definition includes the rich jews, globalists, and Soros and Clintons of the world). Let us band to together as countrymen against the powers that manipulate us, steal from us, lie to us and send our sons, brothers and fathers to war. I don&#039;t want to negotiate with \/pol\/ deplorables but we have no other choice. We take a stand now or democracy, and possibly humanity, ends here.","filename":"1485276860673","ext":".jpg","w":822,"h":960,"tn_w":214,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491621150528,"time":1491621150,"md5":"0bIUYuw5CkLCVKindK4l5A==","fsize":477295,"resto":0,"id":"vLa2H6ls","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"congrats-trump-voters-youve-doomed-us-all","country_name":"United States","replies":51,"images":12,"unique_ips":42},{"no":120076948,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)23:13:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"All they had to do was listen.","filename":"5e5","ext":".png","w":872,"h":804,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":115,"tim":1491621230158,"time":1491621230,"md5":"A43AW6\/WajC448w5UvqtmA==","fsize":462075,"resto":120076792,"id":"O2WkAVaY","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120077025,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)23:14:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120076792\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120076792<\/a><br>Go back to leftypol commie cuck","time":1491621266,"resto":120076792,"id":"xoICB75p","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120077100,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)23:15:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"Way to go \/pol\/ you fell for a neo-con","time":1491621301,"resto":120076792,"id":"p1lGkMPL","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120077362,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)23:16:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=OBw<wbr>S66EBUcY<br><br>only one man can save us now","filename":"bernierun","ext":".gif","w":204,"h":360,"tn_w":70,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491621412432,"time":1491621412,"md5":"E8IdmnYPq4bg+X4sIkNvow==","fsize":1704787,"resto":120076792,"id":"+ogIWRHQ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120077394,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)23:17:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120076792\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120076792<\/a><br>Can we exterminate the white race in the process? <br><br>White people elected Trump.

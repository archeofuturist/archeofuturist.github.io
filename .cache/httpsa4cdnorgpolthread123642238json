To save money they needed to temporarily use a different water source. They used the flint river which was polututed but could be cleaned up using the proper filtration and chemicals. The active chemicals in the flint water would react with the lead pipes and deteriote them causing lead to seep in. If the water was cleaned up prior to use this would not be an issue. But the local government fucked it up. They did not properly handle the flint river water. This then caused the destruction of the pipes and even now that they have been switched back to the original water source it is still shitty water. <br>Tl;dr; work needed to get done on original water source, could use flint river water if treated correctly. Government did not treat correctly and it fucked everything up.","time":1493658743,"resto":123642238,"id":"nwYwqNIx","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123643957,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)13:14:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123643746\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123643746<\/a><br>also the retards in Flint ( niggers mainly) still had lead pipes in their homes when every other rational human had switched to copper or PVC in the 70&#039;s","time":1493658854,"resto":123642238,"id":"ssO2GSGM","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123644150,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)13:15:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"The government agency *caused* the problem.","time":1493658955,"resto":123642238,"id":"PioZtYzn","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123644365,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)13:17:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123642238\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123642238<\/a><br>clean water is socialism.","time":1493659079,"resto":123642238,"id":"YEkE085w","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123645562,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)13:27:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123643957\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123643957<\/a><br>How is that the tenants fault?

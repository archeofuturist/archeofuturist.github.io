I smoked pot for 8 years and quit a month ago. Took me a while to ween off of it and I still indulged from time to time but I got there. InB4 weed isn&#039;t addictive but when you smoke it every single day from the age of 15, it starts to become more than a habit. Initially I began to make up for my habit by achieving more in other facets of life, but over time it dwindled and I became a reclusive pot head with no realizable goals or motivation. Dated a girl for 5 years and rejected socializing with other women who made advances on me because I was afraid (not entirely weed&#039;s fault but a big part.) Eventually I started to realize it was hurting my life and it took 4 years to completely stop. I can&#039;t socialize the way I want to when I&#039;m high. The thing is my awareness grew every time I would get high. The point is... every time you are playing video games, you are aware that it is negatively affecting you.

Always keep your dream in mind and keep the vision of your better future. You&#039;ll need the dream to push you through the tough times and keep you from relapsing. <br><br>Part of the reason you have bad habits is because nobody helped you develop good habits. This can be tough. You have to force yourself to learn and do new shit. Your brain will resist this as it&#039;s used to the self indulgent routine. Keep an eye for a teacher. Someone who can help you learn the ropes of a new hobby or habit you want to get into. Make a friend at ther gym. All starts with a smile and a hello. <br><br>Not totally necessary but a counselor isn&#039;t a bad idea if you have access to one. Support group? Helps to have someone in your corner cheering you on and encouraging to make a change and push through. This may also involve leaving behind your current friends who would encourage if not enable your bad habits. <br><br>Again, remember what it is you actually want to accomplish. It&#039;s not to simply quit vids. It&#039;s to live a more enriching life. This a tougher and more dynamic goal but you have some first steps in mind and and that&#039;s a great beginning. <br><br>Good luck brother anon.","time":1491794183,"resto":120358759,"id":"\/FJAtz2y","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120384102,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)23:18:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120382804\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120382804<\/a><br>black and milds are only good for gutting and turning into bloonts","time":1491794286,"resto":120358759,"id":"i1akg7Eu","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120384246,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)23:19:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120381655\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120381655<\/a><br>go to the gym<br>go running<br>become a health nut","time":1491794358,"resto":120358759,"id":"i1akg7Eu","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120384301,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)23:19:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120383556\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120383556<\/a><br>coffee is for weakniggers that need to patch their unhealthy weakness with drugs","time":1491794386,"resto":120358759,"id":"EwLuJvFV","country":"MX","country_name":"Mexico"},{"no":120384395,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)23:20:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120383875\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120383875<\/a><br>valium is a benzo...","time":1491794438,"resto":120358759,"id":"nYT0no+H","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":120384436,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)23:21:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120382804\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120382804<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Girl cigarillos <\/span><br>kys stop smoking tobacco you can inhale.","time":1491794462,"resto":120358759,"id":"E60wPP0h","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120384439,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)23:21:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120383891\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120383891<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;GREAT!

I smoked pot for 8 years and quit a month ago. Took me a while to ween off of it and I still indulged from time to time but I got there. InB4 weed isn&#039;t addictive but when you smoke it every single day from the age of 15, it starts to become more than a habit. Initially I began to make up for my habit by achieving more in other facets of life, but over time it dwindled and I became a reclusive pot head with no realizable goals or motivation. Dated a girl for 5 years and rejected socializing with other women who made advances on me because I was afraid (not entirely weed&#039;s fault but a big part.) Eventually I started to realize it was hurting my life and it took 4 years to completely stop. I can&#039;t socialize the way I want to when I&#039;m high. The thing is my awareness grew every time I would get high. The point is... every time you are playing video games, you are aware that it is negatively affecting you. This doesn&#039;t mean you are going to stop but eventually you are going to reach a point of awareness where you realize that you&#039;d rather be doing something else... and then you&#039;ll just do something else.<br><br>There is nothing I can do high on pot that I can&#039;t do better sober.<br><br>There is nothing I can enjoy high on pot that I can&#039;t enjoy sober.<br><br>This isn&#039;t true for all people, drugs affect people differently.<br><br>Realize that video games are your means of satisfying your boredom without supplementing your lack of accomplishment.

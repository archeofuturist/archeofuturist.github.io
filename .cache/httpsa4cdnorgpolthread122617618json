Through housing they have earned money doing nothing and in doing so pushed most younger earners out of the market completely. These young people are then forced to rent, which is of course higher than it&#039;s ever been because the boomer owners have realised they can get away with charging whatever they want, because it&#039;s not like young people have the choice.<br><br>They also had access to free university education, never having had to pay a penny for world class education that enabled them to get secure, stable jobs. Then they pulled that ladder up as well, meaning people today are facing fees of \u00a39000 per year to qualify with a degree that guarantees them nothing, entering into a job market comprised in large part of zero-hour contracts and part time work.<br><br>The boomer generation were guaranteed state pensions that allowed them to retire at 60 (female) or 65 (male), and this was fair enough because they had paid national insurance to let them do so. Except, there are too many pensioners and not enough workers, and the national insurance paid by them during their working life is not enough to cover ongoing pensions of people who are drawing it for 20 or more years after retirement. So, the national insurance of people working today is going to cover this, meaning that at this point anyone working right now is effectively paying into one giant pyramid scheme they&#039;ll likely never see a payout from. <br><br>But of course, my generation is entitled. We have it easy.

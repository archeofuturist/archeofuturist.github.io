There are two broad categories of bipolar, type 1 and type 2. Type 1 is characterized by true mania, which involves elements of psychosis, while Type 2 is characterized by hypomania, which is mania without elements of psychosis. While the presence of psychosis is an important distinction, it is more likely that the two types lie on a spectrum.<br><br>People in active mania or hypomania have produced some of the greatest works of art and literature. Mania is like naturally dosing your brain with amphetamines to push it into overdrive and the pharmacological consequences is a prolonged period of depression. As a doctor who has dated someone with Type 2 bipolar, I can say that she was brilliant when she was on one of her highs, and noticeably dumber when she was depressive.<br><br>I don&#039;t think type 2 can strictly be said to be pathological because I think it&#039;s a normal part of human neural diversity. However, type 1 is pathological because almost nobody with untreated type 1 bipolar is able to function well in society. People with type 2 bipolar can often function decently without medication, but may still run into many issues because most jobs in modern society don&#039;t allow for months of creative productivity followed by months of nothing.","time":1491857154,"resto":120484750,"id":"4Wdl0rw1","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120488362,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)16:47:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120487561\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120487561<\/a><br>show tits and it will solve problem or gtfo","time":1491857231,"resto":120484750,"id":"n5bicPto","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120488370,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)16:47:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120484750\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120484750<\/a><br>From where I come from it&#039;s called being happy and being sad.<br><br>Besides this it&#039;s all to slide germany.","time":1491857234,"resto":120484750,"id":"DomCR\/p9","country":"CL","country_name":"Chile"},{"no":120488376,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)16:47:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"i think im becoming psychotic","filename":"me suicide think face","ext":".jpg","w":540,"h":404,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1491857236239,"time":1491857236,"md5":"8v3xAOpaiW6yoK0daZLYDw==","fsize":42698,"resto":120484750,"id":"CScqxb9d","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120488766,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)16:50:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"Bipolar disorder is when you have everything given to you and you don&#039;t really have to work for shit so your brain starts making up fake problems and you get depressed because you don&#039;t have it as bad as people with real problems.","time":1491857405,"resto":120484750,"id":"dGCMdBNe","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120488872,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)16:50:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120488167\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120488167<\/a><br>Doctor, I&#039;d be impressed if you were to actually cure a disease instead of just treating it with pharmaceuticals..

Symptoms include loss of rational thought, extreme rage and depression, suicidal thoughts.

With bipolar specifically, our mood stabilizing drugs tend to flatten the patient&#039;s affect so that they neither get the same highs, nor the same lows. This actually makes it difficult because bipolar people understandably enjoy their highs and that makes them unwilling to seek treatment until they hit their lows again, but the lows naturally follow from the highs and we don&#039;t have a way to get rid of the lows without also getting rid of the highs. <br><br>That said, while I&#039;m not aware of the figures, I have a general impression that pharmaceuticals are overprescribed in America, and to a lesser extent in Canada, for mental illness, especially for disorders such as ADHD.","time":1491858796,"resto":120484750,"id":"4Wdl0rw1","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120492004,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)17:13:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120491556\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120491556<\/a><br>I can say that it&#039;s manufactured because that&#039;s what they diagnosed me as at 18 years old (7 years ago) and just this year was I found to be misdiagnosed.

For now, if your life is shit because of mental illness, we have some crude treatments that can help you make it a less shit.","time":1491859310,"resto":120484750,"id":"4Wdl0rw1","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120493279,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)17:22:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120492643\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120492643<\/a><br>Dude, you watched the pharmaceutical ads on tv, but missed the law suit ads against the pharmaceutical companies? <br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=kLU<wbr>f7ejkqhI<br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=kDJ<wbr>83TLg6lk<br><br>Honestly, I could post thousands of these , but I&#039;m not going to","time":1491859328,"resto":120484750,"id":"jLXHnYI4","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120493350,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)17:22:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120493133\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120493133<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; that can be fixed if only you acted like normal human beings<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;India<\/span>","time":1491859355,"resto":120484750,"id":"WFA5wiZM","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":120493647,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)17:24:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120493242\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120493242<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;If we could determine exactly which neural circuits are producing aberrant behavior<\/span><br><br>The SECOND they figure that out is when the government weaponizes it against its own people.<br><br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Oppos<wbr>itional_defiant_disorder","time":1491859487,"resto":120484750,"id":"4Sa3ByeA","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120493791,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)17:25:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120493350\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120493350<\/a><br>lel godless Russians literally come here begging for us to teach them how to live","time":1491859545,"resto":120484750,"id":"PYjGlV5h","country":"IN","country_name":"India"},{"no":120493820,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)17:25:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120493133\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120493133<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;the symptoms are mainly due to a shit lifestyle<\/span><br><br>An Indian would know a thing or two about a shit lifestyle, am I right?","time":1491859555,"resto":120484750,"id":"VYSwsaMV","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120493893,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)17:26:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120493133\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120493133<\/a><br>Well, new research involving brain scans is able to determine who has dysfunctions like bipolar with high accuracy, so this isn&#039;t really true.","time":1491859588,"resto":120484750,"id":"pWBsZmJ9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120493907,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)17:26:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120492339\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120492339<\/a><br>I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder years before<br><br>Zyprexa made me gain weight and I wanted to stop taking it.

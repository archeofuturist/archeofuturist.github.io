Fiat currency will always fail. There is no debate on this. Empires have risen and fallen since the beginning of time. Scarcity will always have a massive effect on value - period. Fiat currency is not a scarce good, and its supply is not fixed. It can be inflated at whim by a Federal Reserve that is not an actual Federal entity. This is done purposefully to manufacture crashes that further assimilate the totality of global credit into a small set of elite royal families&#039; hands. <br><br>https:\/\/mises.org\/library\/fiasco-fi<wbr>at-money<br>http:\/\/money.visualcapitalist.com\/c<wbr>urrency-and-the-collapse-of-the-rom<wbr>an-empire\/","time":1490738557,"resto":118691083,"id":"j7XD5941","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118703510,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)18:02:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118691083\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118691083<\/a><br>Boom<br>and<br>The Biggest Bust.","filename":"1490409571969","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":683,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1490738568566,"time":1490738568,"md5":"hagry0aDjkgpn+m4nuALjw==","fsize":152494,"resto":118691083,"id":"i2a5AzHU","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118703918,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)18:06:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118695539\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118695539<\/a><br>read reverse<br><br>FEM<br>RUSH<br>SSWS<br><br>but what it mean?","time":1490738775,"resto":118691083,"id":"m7S7+YaB","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":118704145,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)18:08:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118703476\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118703476<\/a><br>I know it&#039;s history and fiat currency because unlike you, way back when i was an undergraduate freshman I bothered to learn macroeconomics.

For instance, each of the 12 Reserve Banks operates within its own particular geographic area, or District, of the United States, and each is separately incorporated and has its own board of directors. Commercial banks that are members of the Federal Reserve System hold stock in their District&#039;s Reserve Bank. However, owning Reserve Bank stock is quite different from owning stock in a private company. The Reserve Banks are not operated for profit, and ownership of a certain amount of stock is, by law, a condition of membership in the System. In fact, the Reserve Banks are required by law to transfer net earnings to the U.S. Treasury, after providing for all necessary expenses of the Reserve Banks, legally required dividend payments, and maintaining a limited balance in a surplus fund.&quot; <br><br>Literally on the federal reserve website, and if you think I&#039;m going to take you seriously when you link to an Austrian economics website then you&#039;re sorely mistaken.

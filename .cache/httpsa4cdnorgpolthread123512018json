They seem to be under the False premise that &quot;If it&#039;s a Social Construct, it must be Bad and therefore needs to be overturned and changed&quot; way of thinking<br><br>SJW&#039;s and Leftists in general don&#039;t realise that, like a hammer, Social Constructs are Tool in some regards.<br><br>You can use the hammer to put a nail into the wall and hang a painting or you can use it to bash someone&#039;s head in.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;It all depends on the one using the tool and their intentions<\/span><br><br>So, Social Constructs are like this, some are good and we need to keep them <br>e.g. &gt;Man being the Head of the Household, Woman to be in subservient to the Husband<br><br>Some are bad or just lies and we would like to see them purged<br>e.g.&gt;Women can have it all, High pressure Job, Loyal Husband and happy kids<br><br>Disfellowshipping is also like this<br><br>Yes, crazy Cults use this tactic to intimidate their members and coerce them in some way to some evil end usually, out of no genuine interest for the Physical or Mental well being of that individual. Because, quite frankly it&#039;s very effective in this regard<br><br>But the intention is very evil in groups like BAMN for instance, as we&#039;ve learned recently.<br><br>But if you look at the scriptural reason&#039;s for casting someone out of the Congregation of God, it&#039;s intentions are always to see the Sinner repent from their willful wrong doing and return back to the flock to once again be under the loving supervision of a God who cares for them, and without whom, the individual would be without hope.<br><br>It&#039;s just a Tool Jehovah uses to discipline those whom he loves but have strayed. No Evil intention at all<br><br>I mean God cast out Satan and his rebellious angels from Heaven didn&#039;t he, don&#039;t see you crying about that, do we?","filename":"Jehovah-ca0dd5af3d","ext":".png","w":270,"h":300,"tn_w":225,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493579414986,"time":1493579414,"md5":"ixswWKlOX0CHVljv0jNyVw==","fsize":121132,"resto":0,"id":"iu9O\/H8A","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"jw-on-pol","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":7,"images":1,"unique_ips":2},{"no":123512426,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)15:13:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"You&#039;re problem with Disfellowshipping stems from a WORLDLY interpretation of Ethics and Morality, not that of God&#039;s own word.<br><br>You seem to assign blame exclusively to the people doing the casting out and not asking the obvious crucial question, <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;What did they do to warrant that&quot;<\/span><br><br>And without a proper understanding of what is a sin in God&#039;s eyes, some of the answers may seem petty or trivial in your opinion.<br><br>But remember it is just that, YOUR OPINION!

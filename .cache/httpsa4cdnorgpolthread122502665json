Obamacare does help a great number of people, the economy did recover from 2008 during his first term, and he was an honorable man who made our country look good. His great flaws were that he refused to negotiate whatsoever with a republican congress, and did double the national debt. Those aside, I would still give him a 3rd term if I could.","filename":"Barack-Obama-Wave[1]","ext":".jpg","w":618,"h":412,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1492987970593,"time":1492987970,"md5":"uP1SIcrv4Brnw0OGJvctpA==","fsize":88382,"resto":0,"id":"8iYKDTHs","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"ill-go-out-on-a-limb-here-and-say-that-obama-was","country_name":"United States","replies":19,"images":2,"unique_ips":14},{"no":122502786,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)18:53:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"Better than Trump","time":1492988018,"resto":122502665,"id":"IvrfUY\/v","country":"PT","country_name":"Portugal"},{"no":122503215,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)18:56:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122502665\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122502665<\/a><br>So if I make up an alternate reality, Obama was a good president.

A lot of the failures that we put on Obama are in fact the failures of the GOP congress which had trouble performing even routine legislative business. Working with Obama in any productive way was politically impossible for individual congressmen. None of them wanted to be the guy who worked with Obama when primary season came. There was a moment in a 2012 primary debate when the GOP candidates were asked if they&#039;d make a deal with Obama where they got 90% of what they want.

I&#039;ve sent you various premature bullshit apologies before, but unlike everything that was sent prior to this email, this apology is without any motive or selfish hopes, for the first time:<br><br>Simply put, our silly &amp; fun memories are routinely stomped out by memories of my post-breakup actions, which is fucking soul crushing, really. <br><br>We all walk through a desert to get to our oasis, and I repeatedly offered a mirage of having water to offer that stunted us both. That lasting negative energy in my memories is just disgusting, considering the experiences we had together. On the level of your &quot;Oh-that&#039;s-SICK&quot; updating from Windows 8 kind of disgusting moment. GROSS.<br><br>Still, we helped each other write a page in our life stories, but I really believe that rewriting how that page ended might be in order. If you wanna, I&#039;d love to meet up to update - SO much to update holy shit! <br><br>&quot;","filename":"Screenshot_2016-10-26-22-13-30","ext":".png","w":1080,"h":1920,"tn_w":140,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493253437837,"time":1493253437,"md5":"dHqs6tc6Qs4vLHsLHRQY2A==","fsize":1554085,"resto":0,"id":"BrJIgv0a","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"posted-a-lengthier-thing-that-was-more-crimge-but","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":122966718,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)20:40:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"nice man, she will certainly appreciate this. so emotionally mature.","time":1493253632,"resto":122966294,"id":"HycGsLzX","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

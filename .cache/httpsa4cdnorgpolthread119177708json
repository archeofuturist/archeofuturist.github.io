They argued that Trump didn\u2019t intend for his supporters to use force.<br><br>Two women and a man say they were shoved and punched by audience members at Trump\u2019s command. Much of it was captured on video and widely broadcast during the campaign, showing Trump pointing at the protesters and repeating \u201cget them out.\u201d<br><br>Judge David J. Hale in Louisville ruled Friday that the suit against Trump, his campaign and three of his supporters can proceed. Hale found ample facts supporting allegations that the protesters\u2019 injuries were a \u201cdirect and proximate result\u201d of Trump\u2019s actions, and noted that the Supreme Court has ruled out constitutional protections for speech that incites violence.<br><br>\u201cIt is plausible that Trump\u2019s direction to \u2018get \u2018em out of here\u2019 advocated the use of force,\u201d the judge wrote. \u201cIt was an order, an instruction, a command.\u201d<br><br>Plaintiffs Kashiya Nwanguma, Molly Shah and Henry Brousseau allege that they were physically attacked by several members of the audience, including Matthew Heimbach, Alvin Bamberger and an unnamed defendant they have yet to be able to identify.","filename":"MatthewHeimbach2","ext":".jpg","w":1800,"h":1143,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":158,"tim":1491119007063,"time":1491119007,"md5":"CKm6ZLu0k0N\/74XQBJ6t9g==","fsize":356860,"resto":0,"id":"sMAY\/vqg","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"white-nationalist-caught-up-in-trump-incitement","country_name":"United

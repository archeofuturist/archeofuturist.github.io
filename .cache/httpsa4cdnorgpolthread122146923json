There are many schools of thought, but let&#039;s just point out that natural rights were, yes, initially derived from God as creator of all human beings; then mostly Protestant authors (Grotius, for example) pushed for it to be &quot;human reason&quot; because the original version was too Catholic and pro-king&#039;s rights for their taste.

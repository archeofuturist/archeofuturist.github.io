Atheism is in decline worldwide, with the number of atheists falling from 4.5% of the world&#039;s population in 1970 to 2.0% in 2010 and projected to drop to 1.8% by 2020, <br><br>Real surveys and statistics say atheism is on the decline worldwide. Sorry atheists but atheism is not on the rise nor is it winning. It&#039;s still the minority and a declining one at that. <br><br>The Pew Research Center&#039;s statistics show that atheism is expected to continue to decline all the way into 2050 with a continued growth of religion. Other research also shows a huge surge in growth for Christianity in China which is currently the world&#039;s most &quot;atheist&quot; nation because of the atheist communist government suppressing religion, the research suggests that China will soon become the world&#039;s most Christian nation within 15 years. <br><br>This is simply history repeating itself: Christianity prospered in Rome back in the ancient era when it was suppressed and it still grew in the militant atheist soviet Russia when it was suppressed there only a century ago with the majority of Russians today now also identifying as Christian. Just goes to show that atheist suppression of religion still doesn&#039;t stop religion.<br><br>Sources for the legion of whiny \/Redditor\/ fedoras that will no doubt show up it this thread:<br><br>http:\/\/www.pewforum.org\/2015\/04\/02\/<wbr>religious-projections-2010-2050\/<br>http:\/\/www.pewforum.org\/2012\/12\/18\/<wbr>global-religious-landscape-unaffili<wbr>ated\/<br>http:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/news\/wor<wbr>ldnews\/asia\/china\/10776023\/China-on<wbr>-course-to-become-worlds-most-Chris<wbr>tian-nation-within-15-years.html<br>http:\/\/masterrussian.com\/russia\/fac<wbr>ts.htm","filename":"1490142549767","ext":".jpg","w":608,"h":755,"tn_w":201,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491574211823,"time":1491574211,"md5":"gbLQR\/M\/TdWWLU+dYjIA+Q==","fsize":123410,"resto":0,"id":"i16l8kP7","country":"PL","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"atheism-is-the-fastest-shrinking-religion-in-the","country_name":"Poland","replies":6,"images":2,"unique_ips":6},{"no":119955358,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)10:22:58","name":"WOLFSHIEM","com":"<a href=\"#p119953191\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119953191<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;using an edited picture<\/span><br>The like was actually &quot;my wife and I are white evangelicals&quot;.<br>But the Evangelicals are also the pro-Israel branch of Christianity too so this is expected.","time":1491574978,"resto":119953191,"id":"moBLO2ho","country":"US","trip":"!!tuOwy1ct2dy","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119955833,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)10:25:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119953191\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119953191<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;atheism<\/span><br>&#039;&gt;religion<br>This retard again.","filename":"12023All_A_AtheistsAreMuslim_zahra8.3 TIX","ext":".jpg","w":214,"h":315,"tn_w":84,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491575140779,"time":1491575140,"md5":"RYfwuUaqTf8C5FKEgYU03A==","fsize":73399,"resto":119953191,"id":"Jy7KlpRj","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119957459,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)10:34:57","name":"WOLFSHIEM","com":"<a href=\"#p119955833\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119955833<\/a><br>People eat up this bait all the time.","time":1491575697,"resto":119953191,"id":"moBLO2ho","country":"US","trip":"!!tuOwy1ct2dy","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119958344,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)10:39:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119953191\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119953191<\/a><br>bait, but<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Atheism<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;religion<\/span><br>pick one<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;atheism is not on the rise<\/span><br>literally no one cares<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;nor is it winning<\/span><br>literally no one cares<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Christianity<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;winning<\/span><br>Oh you&#039;re just a fucking retard, got it.","time":1491575994,"resto":119953191,"id":"1TAesJay","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119959252,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)10:45:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119953191\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119953191<\/a><br>Those people take the concept of &#039;pro life&#039; way too seriously.

Sure we think they&#039;re weird and stuffy, but they&#039;re the only country we feel any natural respect towards. Make no mistake, when push comes to shove Americans will side with the Crown every time. Americans appreciate force. It may be a surprise, but Americans appreciate the &quot;sneering imperialist&quot; mentality. We fucking hate French people and Germans; I can personally attest to this.

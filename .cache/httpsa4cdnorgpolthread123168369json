Those who do not understand this do not know me,&quot; he stressed.<br>&quot;I want Poland&#039;s case to be looked at in a holistic way, and to put sanctions on issues of European Union law and values,&quot; Macron repeated. Macron was supposed to meet only with a factory union delegation on Wednesday, whose workers are on strike Monday. The change of plans and meetings with employees forced him to visit unexpectedly Marine Le Pen, the extreme right-wing candidate of the National Front, who appeared in the plant at noon.","time":1493369158,"resto":123168369,"id":"BwFpb1E6","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":123171152,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)04:47:00","name":"Anonymous","filename":"EU","ext":".jpg","w":496,"h":429,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":108,"tim":1493369220474,"time":1493369220,"md5":"FdnYbx6Eooe\/z9Hpitz9jQ==","fsize":56003,"resto":123168369,"id":"a1C7M2C\/","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123171162,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)04:47:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123170227\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123170227<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Good.

Basically it&#039;s a 2D spacesim with waifus. Setting is a mix of sci-fi and cyberpunk with greedy corporations and shit. Currently we trying to get funded on IndieGoGo. I need your help on redpill related jokes. So far I thought about feminazis as main enemy and enforcers of corporations, reptiloids as secret boss and few kinda muslim colonials-planets named Neo Sweden and Neo England. I need your ideas, possible references, more subtlety, I can&#039;t go full memelands retard. Nothing of this is final, I really would like to hear your ideas. If the project gets funded and the game becomes commercially successful I plan further to counter pro-left and anti-consumer tendencies in gaming industry.<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/b51Xyrupsb8 [Embed]<br>Last thread accidentally drowned <a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/120672040#p120672040\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120672040<\/a>. <br>But now we may feature fashwave tracks from anon and Chile helicopters reference.","filename":"logo2","ext":".gif","w":736,"h":490,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1491959146042,"time":1491959146,"md5":"Q8PfsL27V6CxcIuwfQOPZQ==","fsize":265128,"resto":0,"id":"1PpExuS6","country":"RU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"hello-anons-im-making-pol-influenced-vidya","country_name":"Russian Federation","replies":1,"images":1,"unique_ips":1},{"no":120689980,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)21:10:32","name":"Anonymous","filename":"UHZ-mHw-5YM","ext":".jpg","w":1000,"h":1402,"tn_w":89,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491959432038,"time":1491959432,"md5":"exA9ulvgdPTIhifnIJviuw==","fsize":204386,"resto":120689440,"id":"1PpExuS6","country":"RU","m_img":1,"country_name":"Russian Federation"}]}

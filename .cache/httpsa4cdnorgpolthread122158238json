Middle aged and older people can&#039;t transition to another career, so they succumb to alcoholism and opiates until they commit suicide. Young people have no prospects, and if they want to educate themselves to take up STEM, those jobs are outsourced or they are replaced by cheap H1B visa labor. Exacerbating this is the willingness of doctors throughout the past few decades to prescribe opiates to their patients for the most minor of pain complaints, creating addictions and filling holes that were widened by dwindling economic prospects and a changing culture which downplays and mocks marriage and the image of a happy family (these days, the only family that&#039;s celebrated is the one with existential and interpersonal problems)<br><br>This is all waxing philosophical without identifying how to make a change, so we have to identify the political party preventing and, if anything, encouraging and promoting this trend: Democrats.<br><br>They celebrate and publicly laugh at white men committing suicide in record numbers<br>http:\/\/www.theblaze.com\/news\/2017\/0<wbr>4\/14\/watch-maine-democrats-laugh-ab<wbr>out-rising-suicide-rates-among-whit<wbr>e-males\/<br><br>Their embrace of free trade policies and sudden disregard for the working class while pushing for cheaper H1B labor and outsourcing is the equivalent of Republican restructuring voting zones while claiming that it has nothing to do with race: it&#039;s obvious bullshit to anyone who has enough street smarts to see it<br><br>tl;dr Dems are pushing policies targeting white men and encouraging them to commit suicide","time":1492796168,"resto":122158238,"id":"dh3GeWjF","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122160680,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)13:38:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122158238\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122158238<\/a><br>- have to live in miserable suburbs.<br>- easy access to guns to end it.","time":1492796283,"resto":122158238,"id":"qX\/Kr4Js","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":122160758,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)13:38:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122158894\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122158894<\/a><br><a href=\"#p122159802\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122159802<\/a><br>This contributes to the issue but is hardly the damning factor.

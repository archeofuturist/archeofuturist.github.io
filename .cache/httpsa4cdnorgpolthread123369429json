Nothing matters except getting laughs. The fact you need to politicize everything like <a href=\"#p123396106\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123396106<\/a> does is one of the major reasons 4chan sucks these days. <br><br>It didn&#039;t help that moot defanged the 4chan originally and started it on its long decline to being a hapless giant, but surrendering to outside interests because they help push your political agenda is a much worse choice in the long run since you don&#039;t voluntarily put on the chains of one group while you struggle to throw off those of another.","time":1493507873,"resto":123369429,"id":"j6Z5q2Ya","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123397732,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)19:18:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123396870\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123396870<\/a><br>4chan used to have literally illegal content for years back in the early days.

Everything you know, or at least the vast majority of everything you know, is shaped by your senses. Your understanding of what you see at the objective reality of the universe ultimately comes down to you having sensed a bunch of shit and then made a picture of what you see as objective.<br>Now you can talk about how you see the objective reality to be, and why there is no logical reason to believe in afterlife, I agree with you on your view of the objective universe but you&#039;re missing the point. If try to seek meaning in the metaphysical, you&#039;ll inevitably end up disappointed. That&#039;s why you have to come down to the basics, down to Earth. <br>So ultimately what should matter to YOU is what YOU sense. If what you sense is shit, then there really isn&#039;t any meaning. But if what you sense is great, then hey life isn&#039;t so bad after all. <br>It doesn&#039;t take a genius to realize the faults in purely seeking pleasure because you&#039;ll never lead a life of only pleasure. That being said trying to minimize the pain and maximize the pleasure is sufficient. <br>Realizing this and then going out and just doing whatever the fuck you want is retarded though, you need to be smarter about it. You should try to achieve this through things such as family, friends, work, hobbies, things you like. While not having anything really objective and logical about them, these things can bring you long term fulfillment which plays into something you know for certain, that is the pleasure and fulfillment you are feeling.<br>Tying your identity to the metaphysical or believing in God should be for the commoner who can then work to keep stuff running. Believing in a God is a great motivator for this.","time":1493508460,"resto":123369429,"id":"qlgMGQi6","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"}]}

A post-ironic comment is usually accompanied with a wink or some other motion to make the listener feel that the speaker is joking, even though they&#039;re not.<\/span><br>http:\/\/www.urbandictionary.com\/defi<wbr>ne.php?term=post-ironic<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Post-irony (from Latin post (after) and Ancient Greek \u03b5\u1f30\u03c1\u03c9\u03bd\u03b5\u03af\u03b1 eir\u014dne\u00eda, meaning dissimulation (or feigned ignorance) is a term used to connote a state in which earnest and ironic intents become muddled, or less commonly, a return from irony to earnestness, similar to New Sincerity. Examples of post-ironic artwork include South African band Die Antwoord, the British television show Garth Marenghi&#039;s Darkplace and the Werner Herzog film Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans. Noted surreal humor comedian Tim Heidecker portrays a man living a post-ironic lifestyle in The Comedy. and comedy trio Million Dollar Extreme has been described as post-ironic.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In literature, David Foster Wallace is often described as the founder of a &quot;postironic&quot; literature. His essays &quot;E Unibus Pluram&quot; and &quot;Fictional Futures and the Conspicuously Young&quot; describe and hope for a literature that goes beyond postmodern&#039;s irony. Other authors oftentimes described as postironic are Dave Eggers, Tao Lin, and Alex Shakar.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Whereas in postmodern irony something is meant to be cynically mocked and not taken seriously, and in new sincerity something is meant to be taken seriously or &quot;unironically&quot;; post-irony combines these two elements by either (i) having something absurd taken seriously or (ii) be unclear as to whether something is meant to be ironic. Over the years, it has become increasingly common on imageboards such as 4chan, 8ch, Krautchan, Ylilauta, and Circleboard.<\/span><br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Post-<wbr>irony<br><br>Give me ONE term better to describe \/pol\/ than post-ironic.","filename":"1489712016295","ext":".png","w":556,"h":616,"tn_w":225,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490922568346,"time":1490922568,"md5":"jhcvHNSCt51EHjK7uWOkTQ==","fsize":546413,"resto":0,"id":"Uad3\/z68","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"post-irony","country_name":"United States","replies":3,"images":3,"unique_ips":2},{"no":118997965,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)21:12:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118997548\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118997548<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Give me ONE term better<\/span><br><br>Why?

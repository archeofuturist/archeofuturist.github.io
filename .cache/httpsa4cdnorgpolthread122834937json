The company&#039;s directors. Who are, logically, in the same industry as the potential CEO at roughly the same level. They quite possibly have been CEOs of other companies in the same industry, and may well be after they leave their current job. Meaning they directly benefit if CEO pay is high. I&#039;m not saying necessarily they make decisions based purely on mercenary self interest. But if they&#039;ve been paid 150 million to be a CEO, it&#039;s psychologically very difficult for them to challenge the idea that CEOs are worth that much. <br><br>Secondly, reputation matters more than actual achievement. What the directors are looking for isn&#039;t a CEO who will be good for the company, because structural improvements in the company will take years to come into effect. What they want is a CEO with a good reputation, because that will give an immediate boost to the stock price as soon as the hiring is done. As <a href=\"#p122838175\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122838175<\/a> said, Marissa Mayer&#039;s main talent was that she happened to be connected to an extremely successful company. <br><br>The fact that she had absolutely nothing to do with its success didn&#039;t matter - just the fact that the connection existed was enough to boost her reputation. And again, given that the people doing the hiring are the same sort of person as the CEO being hired, it&#039;s very difficult for them to say to themselves &#039;You know, I really shouldn&#039;t have gotten this job. I didn&#039;t actually do anything, I just happened to be working at x-company while this other guy who was an absolute genius was working there.&#039; <br><br>In fact, given that reputation is so important the fact that a CEO comes with a high price-tag is a selling point in and of itself. Case in point, you yourself believe that if the company is paying 200 million it must be getting absolutely top-notch leadership.","time":1493180332,"resto":122834937,"id":"eQdJAl5V","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122841626,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)00:19:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122841586\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122841586<\/a><br><br>Additionally, since reputation is based in no small part on what is reported in the press, the fact that a potential CEO is likely to garner a lot of publicity - because, for example, she&#039;s a woman in a traditionally male industry - becomes quite a big factor in how likely they are to be hired.","time":1493180351,"resto":122834937,"id":"eQdJAl5V","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122842786,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)00:30:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122837726\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122837726<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;$200M lost them money<\/span><br>Yes, every salary costs the company money numbnuts.

Dr. Martin Fackler, the man who has done more research on the 5.56 mm<br>55 gr M193 FMJ than anyone else on this planet, has written the following (Fackler, ML: \u201cLiterature<br>Review\u201d. Wound Ballistics Review; 5(2):40, Fall 2001) about 55 gr FMJ:<br>\u201cIn 1980, I treated a soldier shot accidentally with an M16 M193 bullet from a distance of<br>about ten feet. The bullet entered his left thigh and traveled obliquely upward. It exited<br>after passing through about 11 inches of muscle. The man walked in to my clinic with no<br>limp whatsoever: the entrance and exit holes were about 4 mm across, and punctate. Xray<br>films showed intact bones, no bullet fragments, and no evidence of significant tissue<br>disruption caused by the bullet\u2019s temporary cavity. The bullet path passed well lateral to<br>the femoral vessels. He was back on duty in a few days. Devastating? Hardly. The wound<br>profile of the M193 bullet (page 29 of the Emergency War Surgery\u2014NATO Handbook,<br>GPO, Washington, D.C., 1988) shows that most often the bullet travels about five inches<br>through flesh before beginning significant yaw. But about 15% of the time, it travels much<br>farther than that before yawing\u2014in which case it causes even milder wounds, if it missed<br>bones, guts, lung, and major blood vessels. In my experience and research, at least as<br>many M16 users in Vietnam concluded that it produced unacceptably minimal, rather than<br>\u201cmassive\u201d, wounds. After viewing the wound profile, recall that the Vietnamese were<br>small people, and generally very slim. Many M16 bullets passed through their torsos<br>traveling mostly point forward, and caused minimal damage. Most shots piercing an<br>extremity, even in the heavier-built Americans, unless they hit bone, caused no more<br>damage than a 22 caliber rimfire bullet.\u201d&quot;","time":1493229677,"resto":122902496,"country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122914371,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)14:01:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122914155\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122914155<\/a><br>God bless Planet Parenthood","time":1493229716,"resto":122902496,"country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122914374,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)14:02:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122914155\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122914155<\/a><br>I also want to thank Democrats for their abortions.","filename":"2014 abortion-by-ethnicity","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":396,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":82,"tim":1493229720714,"time":1493229720,"md5":"cqiUDyZ2f0eN1WCAVvFyLA==","fsize":37123,"resto":122902496,"country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":122914517,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)14:02:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122911837\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122911837<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;(((historians)))<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;doubled national debt to &quot;save&quot; economy<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;higher healthcare premiums same care<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;kill Bin Laden<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;probably gay<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\/pol\/ still hates him<\/span>","time":1493229773,"resto":122902496,"country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122914603,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)14:03:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122902496\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122902496<\/a><br>He was great for unemployed niggers and rich jews.

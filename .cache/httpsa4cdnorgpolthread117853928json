They contain no Neanderthal DNA and more &quot;archaic hominid&quot; aka homo heidelbergensis or homo erectus, our 2 basal ancestors. <br><br>To further confuse the situation, Australian Aboriginals are so distantly related to all living humans (and least related to Sub-Saharan Africans) that they are all but considered a separate species.

Homo sapiens sapiens (modern Sub-Saharan African) <br>2. Homo sapiens eurasia (modern Eurasians. 3-4% Neanderthal admixture) <br>3. Modern Melanesian (3-5% Denisovan admixture)<br>4.

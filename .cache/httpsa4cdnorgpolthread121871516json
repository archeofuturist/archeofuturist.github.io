What justification is there for more state involvement than is neccessary? It&#039;s basically &quot;gibsmedat&quot;: others have more than I do ergo the state should be able to force that person -on the pain of physical violence or imprisonment- to share his wealth with myself. <br><br>Before you start strawmanning, I do believe that a state should attempt, as far as possible, to boost the prosperity of the nation as far as possible, but that doesn&#039;t mean forced redivision of wealth per se. It&#039;s the &quot;Sure, everyone can afford at least one car but that guy over there can afford ten cars!!!&quot; situation. On top of that, I do believe that there are certain things that the state can simply do more cost-effectively than private individuals such as infrastructure, but that does not contest the idea that minarchism is a good idea, it&#039;s only debating (or splitting hairs) about what the competences of the state should be within that minarchy.<br><br>To paraphrase Thomas Sankara, one of the handful of actually good African leaders [though ironically a commie]: the hand that feeds you is the hand that controls you.

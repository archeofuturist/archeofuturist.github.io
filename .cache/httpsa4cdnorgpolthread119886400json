I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn\u2019t want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything.<br><br>He said, \u201cOh, thank you kindly for your courtesy anon, but it&#039;s quite alright.\u201d<br><br>I was taken aback, and all I could say was \u201cHuh?\u201d but he kept politely giving way to me and going &quot;floccinaucinihilipilification? floccinaucinihilipilification? floccinaucinihilipilification?&quot; and adjusting his glasses while asking if the photo turned out alright in front of my face.

After she scanned each document and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by talking loudly about how Jeremy Corbyn is an honest lad that is unfortnately disastrous for Parliamentary Democracy and the legitimacy of Her Majesty&#039;s Opposition.","filename":"1491477550946","ext":".jpg","w":410,"h":298,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":181,"tim":1491541295435,"time":1491541295,"md5":"pzrEPUp4yd1fw5Ptp9ucHg==","fsize":11019,"resto":0,"id":"scXXCECs","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"itt-times-you-met-a-politican","country_name":"United States","replies":5,"images":1,"unique_ips":5},{"no":119887103,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)01:05:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;no proxy<\/span><br><br>shamefur dispray","time":1491541551,"resto":119886400,"id":"OQjJzSjG","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119888372,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)01:13:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119887103\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119887103<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;yfw airplanes exist<\/span><br><br>Is that you Jacob?","filename":"1491477387514","ext":".png","w":615,"h":620,"tn_w":123,"tn_h":124,"tim":1491541998868,"time":1491541998,"md5":"Y414EcuRf4kGPYwd6cDr6A==","fsize":434031,"resto":119886400,"id":"scXXCECs","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119888818,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)01:15:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"I&#039;ve met some Hungarian, Israeli and Dutch politicians.

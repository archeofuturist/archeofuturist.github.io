That&#039;s 86,000 of your kind - young men just like you, who thought they were fighting for the noble cause of the Fuhrer. They thought they were superior, that they would break the iron reserve of the Red Army. They ended up starving to death like dogs, frostbitten and cold, in some desolate hellhole in Siberia.<br><br>Take note, you fascist scum, you mongrels of a lost cause - this is your ultimate fate. All your rhetoric means nothing when it is crushed like a bug by the iron boot of the People&#039;s Will. Start hoarding your rare Pepes now, you will need them to trade for scraps of food in the prison camps.","filename":"german-soldier-at-stalingrad","ext":".jpg","w":800,"h":517,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":161,"tim":1492663510906,"time":1492663510,"md5":"gnArP\/PnFo3eh3KttvvPFg==","fsize":51729,"resto":0,"id":"l6LrkCzR","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-only-good-fascist-is-a-dead-one","country_name":"United States","replies":7,"images":4,"unique_ips":6},{"no":121954285,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)00:52:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121953556\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121953556<\/a><br>lel @ ur post<br><br>kek @ ur lyfe","time":1492663941,"resto":121953556,"id":"Z438B06s","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121954287,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)00:52:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121953556\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121953556<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;implying I am going to a gulag alive.<\/span>","filename":"hitlerandstalinlookatheworld","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":752,"tn_w":99,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492663942528,"time":1492663942,"md5":"bhf17Qrvu6TMrVsa2a9LOw==","fsize":124892,"resto":121953556,"id":"A5hzoeGl","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121954419,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)00:53:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121953556\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121953556<\/a>","filename":"1491858849126","ext":".jpg","w":202,"h":249,"tn_w":101,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492664020770,"time":1492664020,"md5":"jwS6nn6YI5qYOWQ9T5AqDA==","fsize":5581,"resto":121953556,"id":"QW5QV4Yw","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121954467,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)00:54:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121953556\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121953556<\/a><br>so what you&#039;re saying is that we absolutely have to kill all the communists immediately no matter what, OK I got you senpai","time":1492664045,"resto":121953556,"id":"8jDPKs2w","country":"JP","country_name":"Japan"},{"no":121954704,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)00:56:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121954285\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121954285<\/a><br>This is you.<br><br>This is what happens when you stand up for your cause.<br><br>The nail that sticks out the most gets hammered down the hardest.

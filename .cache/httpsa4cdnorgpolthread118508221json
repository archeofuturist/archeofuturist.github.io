Bullion gold is always doped with a trace amount of various metals(rhodium, palladium, iridium etc) with an exact ratio depending on the individual national bank. IIRC the hungarian national bank had a doping mix of like 18 metals when the bullion was recast after gommunism fell. They would need some serious industrial and chemical equipment if they wanted to purify and recast it and even then, its a too visible crime, its not easy to fence gold to begin with.

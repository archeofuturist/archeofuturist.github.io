The out of Africa theory claims modern humans evolved in Africa and migrated out 50,000 to 100,000 years ago, replacing the existing hominid populations of Asia and Europe. What the Russian geneticists found was that, given known rates of mutation, the most recent common ancestor between Europinoids and Africanoids had to have been at least 120,000 years ago. This evidence, combined with the well established evidence of Neanderthal and Denisovan DNA in European and Asian populations, gives significant support to the multiregional theory. The multiregional theory, pic related, holds that the human species first arose around two million years ago and subsequent human evolution has been within a single human species. This species has been separated in various regional forms, whose populations then cross fertilized\/interbred via migratory groups. <br><br>The out of Africa theory was largely advanced for the political agenda of countering racism, and now stands completely disproven by genetic evidence.","filename":"Multiregionaltheory","ext":".png","w":512,"h":529,"tn_w":120,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493648604023,"time":1493648604,"md5":"hLdZuhRlKITsnPOYJtTK7w==","fsize":14703,"resto":123598997,"id":"yzlF9Pn5","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123626653,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)10:30:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123620246\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123620246<\/a><br>the last thing to go would be the moon landing site akshually","time":1493649037,"resto":123598997,"id":"tSBcl3uO","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":123627070,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)10:34:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123602077\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123602077<\/a><br><br>They were Eurasian Caucasoids that &quot;devolved&quot; or &quot;neotenized&quot; in Tropical America. <br><br>It was probably due to lack of animal protein.

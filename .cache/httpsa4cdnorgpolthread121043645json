I live on a diet based on lentils, barley and green veggies and work out at home.<br><br>although I have enough money I can&#039;t figure out what to do with it. I actually lost interest in mainstream society. The only luxury I get is reading classics on my kindle and coffee\/tea.<br><br>If that&#039;s the end for all the retards who get lost here than I actually pity them.","time":1492168438,"resto":121043645,"id":"Hqq3fYS8","country":"AT","country_name":"Austria"}]}

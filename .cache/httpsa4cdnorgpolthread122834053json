One is the death of the body, which is caused by the separation of the body from the spirit; \u201cThe body without the spirit is dead\u201d (James 2:26). The other is spiritual death, which is to die as pertaining to, or to be separated from, righteousness\u2014to be alienated from the things of God (Alma 12:16, 32; 40:26). Both of these deaths were introduced into the world by the Fall of Adam. But death is also the consequence of our own sins. We make our own spiritual death by our works, our thoughts, and our actions. As Paul said, \u201cThe wages of sin is death\u201d (Rom. 6:23), and some are \u201cdead\u201d while they live (1 Tim. 5:6).<br><br>In explaining these things, Jacob called the physical death the grave and spiritual death he called hell. The Atonement of Jesus Christ will bring all persons back into the presence of God to be judged, the body coming forth from the grave and uniting with the spirit released from paradise or from hell (as the case may be). This will restore all mankind to the presence of God. This is the same as Paul spoke: \u201cFor as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive\u201d (1 Cor. 15:21\u201323). Then those who have willfully rebelled against the light and truth of the gospel will suffer again a spiritual death, which is called the second death (Rev. 20:14; Alma 12:16\u201318; Hel. 14:16\u201319; D&amp;C 76:36\u201337). Each person suffers only one physical death, since when once resurrected, the body can die no more (Alma 11:42\u201345).<br><br>Latter-day revelation teaches that there was no death on this earth before the Fall of Adam. Indeed, death entered the world as a direct result of the Fall (2 Ne. 2:22; Moses 6:48).","time":1493181394,"resto":122834053,"id":"tkYx79iC","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122843504,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)00:38:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122834053\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122834053<\/a><br>Let&#039;s find out.","filename":"OHly9jH","ext":".png","w":208,"h":206,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":123,"tim":1493181480786,"time":1493181480,"md5":"+1DXoCK1w4wUaGFz5r0EGA==","fsize":128898,"resto":122834053,"id":"SZ\/Q0\/UT","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":122843597,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)00:38:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122843306\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122843306<\/a><br>Concerning your national socialism, here is this:<br><br><br>War<br>The Lord has said that in the last days there will be \u201cwars and rumors of wars, and the whole earth shall be in commotion, and men\u2019s hearts shall fail them\u201d (D&amp;C 45:26). As members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, we are a people of peace. We follow the Savior, who is the Prince of Peace. We look forward to His millennial reign, when wars will end and peace will be restored to the earth (see Isaiah 2:4). However, we recognize that in this world, government leaders sometimes send military troops to war to defend their nations and ideals.<br><br>Additional Information<br>Latter-day Saints in the military do not need to feel torn between their country and their God. In the Church, \u201cwe believe in being subject to kings, presidents, rulers, and magistrates, in obeying, honoring, and sustaining the law\u201d (Articles of Faith 1:12).

If Latter-day Saints must go to war, they should go in a spirit of truth and righteousness, with a desire to do good. They should go with love in their hearts for all God\u2019s children, including those on the opposing side.

Verses like Job&#039;s rebuttal that include God&#039;s question of &quot;can you bend the Pleiades&quot; shows awareness of this cosmic drift. Revelation 12&#039;s sign is placing a celestial tick on the long form drift as well as the jewish mastery over tracking the core planets that make up additional stars in the crown. Likely taught by the Orient Kings of Jesus youth and Egyptians from his time spent there. This gets remembered and carried over the millennia of generations of Jewish descendants through ritual feasts and fasting. The Muslims are idiots sticking to just a 13 month lunar calendar with seasons rotating through the months.The Romans are pagans who focused on the suns path through the constellations while missing the black hole hidden from view at the time. Life after death is being remembered after you die. Something we cant control except by our deeds and which historians will label and sort by faith to untangle cultural evolution in mixed societies of Native, Passing Foreigners, and Migrant Aliens. The mixing of culture at a high level of society leads to the denigration of the weaker culture and is forbidden and discouraged to foster growth of more noble ideals.","time":1493188171,"resto":122834053,"id":"1jymEAe4","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122853877,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)02:29:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122853809\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122853809<\/a><br>clearly not educated and informed enough","time":1493188189,"resto":122834053,"id":"4rvlOjaD","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122854146,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)02:33:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122853847\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122853847<\/a><br>So life after death is based on a collective memory?

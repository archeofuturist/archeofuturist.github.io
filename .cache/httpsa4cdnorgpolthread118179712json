Its essential, otherwise humans would only want sex and not even take time to eat. It spikes after sex... and it rises after relationships get older. At 1 year, then at 3 years it rises again. (Sounds like the typical stages of a relationship doesn&#039;t it?) It also rises more in women than in men, and although they cant put humans in cages, they found that monkeys they tested only had high prolactin levels after sex or... when they were brought in and put into cages, and they realized they were trapped. To me it explains why so many women have low libidos and then when getting out of a marriage, suddenly turn into fireballs of sexual desire: they aren&#039;t trapped. Prolactin is apparently what pushes us to want new partners.","time":1490414924,"resto":118179712,"id":"uYe5F1t6","country":"US","country_name":"United

read<br><br>For foreign conquest and alien rule, the evolutionary psychological perspective suggests that women should fear alien rule much less than men, but only so long as they are reproductive, because they then have a good chance of being spared by the conquerors and have the option of marrying into them. Accordingly, the analyses of the Eurobarometer data show that young women are much less xenophobic than young men, but the sex differences disappear around age 50. [\u2026]<br><br>Interestingly, a separate analysis (not shown) demonstrates that the interaction term between sex and age in a combined sample of all ages is not statistically significant, except for religion. It means that, at least for nationality and race, women do not gradually and linearly become more xenophobic over the life course.

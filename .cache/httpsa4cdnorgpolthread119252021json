Why do you think certain areas of the globe haven&#039;t really advanced like the West? Look at the Middle East, it&#039;s like they are still living in the times of Jesus. It seems like places that were under British Rule, or any other civilized Western society, are more advanced than places that were more or less left alone. Look at South Africa for example. It&#039;s no paradise, but it seems like they are better off than most other parts of Africa. I think it&#039;s because the British colonized South Africa and spread &quot;civilization&quot; to them. People can bitch and moan about evil &quot;white colonialism&quot; all they want, but I think it helped most places more than it hurt. <br><br>Maybe I&#039;m not saying anything new here, I don&#039;t know.","filename":"fuckoff","ext":".jpg","w":480,"h":322,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":167,"tim":1491170502481,"time":1491170502,"md5":"YmpSlOAGH9KMLr\/+B5rDEg==","fsize":43815,"resto":0,"id":"6VhtDFHG","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"western-influence","country_name":"United States","replies":18,"images":6,"unique_ips":15},{"no":119252635,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)18:07:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"Welcome, new fag.

In the cold, northerly climates of east asia and Europe we had long, harsh winters. This led to food scarcity for a good part of the year.

They had to create math. <br>Contrarily, along the equatorial line, there was abundant food year round. If one was hungry, one could reach for a banana or eat some insects.

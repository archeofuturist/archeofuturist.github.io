It kept people complacent.<br><br>Now we need to make people see that Republicans=Democrats, we need to turn people against both parties, to allow for the REAL anti-establishment people to rise to power.<br><br>We have the power to meme the collapse of both the Republican party and the Democrat party. The future of the United States is in our hands. And once we successfully destroy those parties, it will pave the way for other parties such as the Libertarian Party and the Green Party to rise to prominence. And while some of us don&#039;t agree with those parties on all issues, we can all agree that they are a hell of a lot better than neocons and neolibs.<br><br>And with those parties rising to prominence, \/OURGUY\/ Rand Paul can easily switch to the Libertarian Party (considering he is a Republican in name only) and we will meme Rand into the presidency in 2020.<br><br>To do that, we need to create meme images and make it go viral.

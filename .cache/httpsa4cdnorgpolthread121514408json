I&#039;d suppose if it were sunny and a nice day out, and I know there were other kids in the neighborhood, I wouldn&#039;t let my children play video games unless it were a dreary day or getting late. <br><br>Even before or in the early infancy of the internet, kids had to interact about it. Trade games, talk about how to do something, make stupid gossip; the internet has replaced all these. While giving immediate help, it also stamps out curiosity and imagination.<br><br>Another problem, going back to teachers and authority, is this &quot;zero tolerance&quot; bullshit. I remember when I was a kid, I was scared shitless of touching another student because you would get a tongue lashing from the principal and possibly suspended. Let kids fight, figure out their limits, get a little bullying in (within reason).","time":1492428789,"resto":121514408,"id":"EQUpiDP3","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121515477,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)07:34:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121514408\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121514408<\/a><br>That&#039;s cute.

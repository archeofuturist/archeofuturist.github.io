I always hated those &quot;if God permits evil, therefor he cannot be good&quot; because of free will and such, but the more I read the news and see all these people suffering I start to believe there&#039;s something I yet not see or understand <br><br>God has been good with me and people around me, to some extent, one would say I should be grateful for it but why is that so many other people must suffer? <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;You&#039;re suffering in earth will be glorified in heaven...<\/span><br>But what of all the millions who don&#039;t believe in heaven, who did not ask for such thing?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Non-believers don&#039;t go to heaven<\/span><br>That only makes the previous premise even worse. That would mean God has chosen a couple of souls to suffer during life and then send them away from heaven for the rest of eternity just for the sake of it.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Bible says God will be just when judging us<\/span><br>suuure! I&#039;m still a bit doubtful but okay<br><br>In the Old Testament, God forces the King to attack David, driving him mad, just for the sake of sending David away which would ultimately cause the kings death and a lot of suffering instead of allowing David to stay with Jonnathan and the king.<br><br>I&#039;ve read a couple of books on apocrypha. If you added those into the bible, it wouldn&#039;t sound much different from any other mythology.","filename":"Caravaggio_-_The_Incredulity_of_Saint_Thomas","ext":".jpg","w":798,"h":588,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":184,"tim":1490924406377,"time":1490924406,"md5":"+UvtJdyr3IjSTLwIHwPZBg==","fsize":90879,"resto":0,"id":"wCwxKSun","country":"MX","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"former-catholic-from-a-hardcore-conservative","country_name":"Mexico","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":1},{"no":119001332,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)21:41:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;tl;dr <\/span><br>If God is good, why does he allow suffering?

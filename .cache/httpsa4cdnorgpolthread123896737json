It has also been shown that such synthetic displays are particularly useful in detecting clines of genetic differentiation associated with movements of populations like those accompanying the Neolithic expansion of farmers from the Near East or, in more recent times, the putative diffusion of Indo-European-speaking populations (Ammerman &amp; Cavalli-Sforza, 1984; Gimbutas, 1973). In this paper we use the same combination of statistical and graphical techniques to study the genetic structure of Italy, a European country whose unity of people and cultures was quite a recent event. The possibility of studying genetic differentiation in a small geographical area is tested and trends of genetic differences are tentatively interpreted in terms of historic and linguistic knowledge. The few demographic pieces of information taken from historical sources and compared with linguistic records support the hypothesis that the genetic structure of Italy still reflects the ethnic stratification of pre-Roman times.<\/span><br><br><br>So yeah, ancient romans were just like the average european, can this fucking shitfest stop now?","time":1493811160,"resto":123896737,"id":"OKfuj+AB","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123903276,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)07:34:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123902929\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123902929<\/a><br>muslim invasion means they&#039;re not quite greek anymore","time":1493811281,"resto":123896737,"id":"42gj7fWW","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123903328,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)07:35:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"Yes keep fighting among yourselves goyims. *laughs in sheckel*<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I think found out who made this thread<\/span>","filename":"GoodGoy","ext":".png","w":480,"h":539,"tn_w":111,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493811313454,"time":1493811313,"md5":"Jq5Jgvi8aM0SnVGyjrNLgQ==","fsize":266600,"resto":123896737,"id":"FLwlodHL","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123903527,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)07:37:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123903276\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123903276<\/a><br>The northern african admixture or middle east one is &gt;2.8% in individuals in which is found in others its not even located<br>Not enough to change the gene pool<br><br>The fact is southern italians were always darker than others, even though fair hair and skin was still present","time":1493811469,"resto":123896737,"id":"6yNet7tQ","country":"IT","country_name":"Italy"},{"no":123903596,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)07:38:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123903527\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123903527<\/a><br>Southern Italians are Greeks and always were","time":1493811530,"resto":123896737,"id":"xstyFQd6","country":"AR","country_name":"Argentina"},{"no":123903773,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)07:41:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123903127\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123903127<\/a><br>I don&#039;t have a dog in the fight.

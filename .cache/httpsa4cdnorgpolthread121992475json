Jeremy Corbyn had never disenfranchised or disrespected the lives of values of his followers he has shown an interest in a greater society that supports and provides for its people. Corbyn has honest policies and honest expectations and for you to say a vote is wasted voting for someone who actually stands for the values i believe in is both insulting and ludicrous. What shall be the alternative the liberals who haven&#039;t shown any promise for years or the conservative government who have single handedly failed those of less fortune and young age. The conservative party has never once tried to include the younger voters because they have never been for the young or the lower class. They rely on us not to vote so they have an easier win for the general election. Well personally i will execute my right to stand against a party that favours the upper class, that has said people below the age of 25 somehow don&#039;t qualify for a living wage, that had trolled university fees whilst renewing and upgrading a nuclear arsenal, that had called discussion again to bomb an innocent country and then turned there backs on the people who seek refuge, that cuts the benefits of the people who could need it most, that had driven the NHS into a weak and feeble state whilst currently being investigated for expense scandals and then telling the people to live within there means, a party that has vowed to leave the echr which we installed to support Europe against tyranny and violation of human rights.<\/span>","filename":"IMG_1067","ext":".jpg","w":454,"h":418,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":230,"tim":1492693448442,"time":1492693448,"md5":"NNdL5xF1TH29H8lx\/VhMJA==","fsize":123232,"resto":0,"id":"VE0T81MX","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"facebook-normies","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":5,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":121992635,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)09:05:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121992475\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121992475<\/a><br>why so much greentext faggot","time":1492693555,"resto":121992475,"id":"F0tJdXO0","country":"IL","country_name":"Israel"},{"no":121992701,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)09:06:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Tell me my vote is wasted and i will tell you your breath is because Jeremy Corbyn is the one politician who i believe had no interest in profit or legacy, who isn&#039;t interested with image and mediocrity and has connected with a generation alienated by Westminster.

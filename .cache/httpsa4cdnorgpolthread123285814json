Trump launched tomahawks on Syria when he was with Xi eating a cake. That was a show of muscle, like look, I&#039;m not afraid to bomb stuff. Poor Syrians, died to prove a point. But Xi will not step back. Trump started an initiative of coal mining in USA couple of days ago because trade with China will be disrupted. China also holds a monopoly on rare earth metals. They are also building planes ships and stuff. They canceled one-child policy. USA should attack before China gets too strong. It is really a game of nerves.

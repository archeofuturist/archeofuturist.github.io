It&#039;s what you make of it and your professors (so long as they&#039;re not retards) welcome challenges so long as you bring the heat and research your shit. however they know most don&#039;t bother (laziness) and they give a decent grade to anyone who can parrot the curriculum well enough.<br><br>A liberal arts\/humanities degree in that area is basically free time to spend in a library learning moral systems, studying history and philosophy, corroborating it with science and social science, learning how to track down and use primary sources - all good rhetoric.<br><br>in my experience the curriculum was general with a slightly liberal bent, nothing too crazy, but you could really make people uncomfortable in a good way by dropping some red-pills through readings outside the book list, There&#039;s really no boundaries so long as you don&#039;t sperg out and cite some 1488 shit and go full brown shirt on people.

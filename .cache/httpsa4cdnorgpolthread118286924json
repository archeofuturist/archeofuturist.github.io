Or at least not any scientific knowledge of the objective world. And so another thing that you might observe about that is that you can survive perfectly well without knowing any science at all in an articulated and developed manner, and of course animals are in that category. So that also I think in some sense undermines the claim of science to anything approaching a universal truth because obviously life can get along perfectly well without it.&quot;","filename":"monkey idiot","ext":".jpg","w":1012,"h":862,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":212,"tim":1490483651080,"time":1490483651,"md5":"POBVVX32jKX4j1R\/5Yl8CQ==","fsize":121838,"resto":0,"id":"eUoQOb+n","country":"AU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"im-sorry-what-were-you-saying-mr-peterson","country_name":"Australia","replies":110,"images":30,"unique_ips":38,"tail_size":50},{"no":118287460,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)19:18:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"Is he saying physics isn&#039;t true because of the bible?

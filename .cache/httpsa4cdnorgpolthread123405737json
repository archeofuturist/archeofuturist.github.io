We have many forms, but we are the same in our core. To raise your power level in a healthy way you must be sorted out, if you aren&#039;t, bad things can happen. <br><br>3: You have an unstable mental\/emotional state and become corrupt and full of hate from being red pidled. You are now a pariah everywhere you go. <br><br>Sort yourself out and \/pol\/ will only strengthen you. Every time you get called a nigger faggot burger Kike shill and have your ideas shit on, you gain more and more self confidence. Only you determine your emotional self worth, so criticism strengthens you. <br><br>But the poor degenerates who flee, never learn a thing in life. <br><br>And those who aren&#039;t sorted out are like Africans with AK47&#039;s. They can&#039;t handle the power levels because they aren&#039;t personally developed, so they become savage golem s lurking in the rotting belly of civilization. Maggots who think they are butterflies are the normies, but pol failures are Maggots who worship being a maggot. A true Pol acolyte is a wasp that preys on maggots.","filename":"download (2)","ext":".jpg","w":302,"h":167,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":138,"tim":1493511291649,"time":1493511291,"md5":"XaQmKC8nN\/RRovNgy5Gsjw==","fsize":11211,"resto":0,"id":"peS2ejpx","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"pol-is-a-mirror","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

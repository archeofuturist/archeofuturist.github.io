There are trans scientists, there are women scientists, there are non-binary scientists, there are latinX scientists. Just because we are scientists doesn\u2019t mean that we are also not people. I care about science, but I also care about justice for trans people. We\u2019re scientists, but also believe that black lives matter, and it\u2019s ok to say both of those things at the same time.","filename":"17990593_1782946715354486_5400890461498682376_o","ext":".jpg","w":2048,"h":1365,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1492600813479,"time":1492600813,"md5":"FDq\/HGfWyrLUdSfnKeQOwg==","fsize":189965,"resto":0,"id":"lUsbsL8z","country":"AU","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"my-hope-in-terms-of-the-march-and-more-broadly","country_name":"Australia","replies":14,"images":1,"unique_ips":9},{"no":121835970,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)07:58:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121832982\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121832982<\/a><br>notice BLM is encrypted reference to lives of tar budgets and of course the darkest shade of the gray matter in the rainbow spectrum. <br>It&#039;s high quality entertainment at your expense where you in a very democratic grateful dead fashion perform seppuku on yourself by using your superpower of literacy.

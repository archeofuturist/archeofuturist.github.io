There are trans scientists, there are women scientists, there are non-binary scientists, there are latinX scientists. Just because we are scientists doesn\u2019t mean that we are also not people. I care about science, but I also care about justice for trans people. We\u2019re scientists, but also believe that black lives matter, and it\u2019s ok to say both of those things at the same time.","filename":"17990593_1782946715354486_5400890461498682376_o","ext":".jpg","w":2048,"h":1365,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1492600813479,"time":1492600813,"md5":"FDq\/HGfWyrLUdSfnKeQOwg==","fsize":189965,"resto":0,"id":"lUsbsL8z","country":"AU","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"my-hope-in-terms-of-the-march-and-more-broadly","country_name":"Australia","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

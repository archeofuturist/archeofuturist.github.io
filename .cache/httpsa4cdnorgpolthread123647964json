Found a local antifa info booth yesterday at a cuck music fest thing at the Seattle Center. Of course, the whole thing was Anarchist\/Antifa\/Blue Hair\/Pink hair\/ shit, but I got some good information. These idiots will tell you anything and sell it to you hard if they think they can rope you in. (Very similar to Military recruiters&#039; style)<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Now they might read this and back down, but I can tell you with extreme confidence that they ARE planning violence against any Law Enforcement or anyone who gets in their way today. Talking about disrupting as much as possible and anything that they even see as remotely &quot;alt-right&quot; WILL BE A TARGET. They are ready for urban civil conflict. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;There is a rumored Pro-Trump\/America counter-protest down there as well, but cannot confirm nor can I find any info on a particular location. <\/span><br><br>My guess, especially to get more support due to the sex abuse allegations and his political standing, Mayor Ed Murray will most likely pull a Berkeley and have as limited police presence as possible. Oh, how the Deep State loves their theatrics. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Be careful in the city today guys and gals! I will be heading in to do more recon in a couple hours and will post throughout the day whatever I find.<\/span><br><br>See you on the battlefield <br><br>Yours Truly,<br>-A Friend of a Friend","filename":"ZA1kKPg","ext":".jpg","w":320,"h":320,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493660822984,"time":1493660822,"md5":"nPdXI7TZAnzr3XW\/El0Lyw==","fsize":30815,"resto":0,"id":"QyWhDNEW","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"seattle-antifa-may-1st-2017-all-that-i-know","country_name":"United States","replies":5,"images":1,"unique_ips":6},{"no":123648175,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)13:48:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"Good work pede!!!

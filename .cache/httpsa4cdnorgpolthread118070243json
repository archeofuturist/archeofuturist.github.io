Capitalism invades and infects nearly all aspects of American life\u2014work, home, sexuality, relationships, family, education\u2014and works to supplant the priorities of connection, leisure, community, and even personal laziness with the goal of ever-moreefficient production (Deleuze &amp; Guattari, 1988).<\/span><br><br>In this instance, the thinking is muddied considerably. &quot;Capitalism&quot;, as an ideology, cannot infect an institution in the same way feminism can because while feminism is an ideology capitalism is merely supposed to describe a certain mode of production.

Feminists have demanded more serious analyses of sexual assault and domestic violence on campus (Armstrong, Hamilton &amp; Sweeney, 2006; Smith, 2014) and have invaded traditionally \u201cmale\u201d fields like philosophy and English. In some cases, like the field of psychology, feminists have made it possible for women to not only invade the (traditionally male and pathologizing) field, but to radically take it over; psychology is now dominated by female students who make up 72% of Ph.D. and Psy.D. recipients entering the field in, 2007 compared to just, 20% in, 1970 (Cynkar, 2007).<\/span><br><br>It&#039;s interesting to note that feminism explicitly defines itself as being anti white.","time":1490357104,"resto":118070243,"id":"yAqxPYcA","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118074025,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)08:08:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118070243\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118070243<\/a><br>Bah, this is the worst.

First, people rarely expect men to hold or propagate feminist viewpoints, particularly in spaces where they interact with other men (Digby, 2013). Second, corporate universities often assume that the fusion between patriarchy and capitalism will receive the least challenge from its most privileged students (e.g., white, heterosexual, upper-class men). Third, men can gain access to spaces that exclude women (and especially feminist women), and can thereby disrupt the notion of \u201cin groups,\u201d dominance, and hierarchy (Connell &amp; Messerschmidt, 2005). And, finally, men with feminist politics are often assumed to be relatively innocuous; jokes about men in women\u2019s studies classes \u201cwanting to get laid,\u201d or men \u201calready knowing about women\u201d help to contribute to this illusion (Strimpel, 2012).

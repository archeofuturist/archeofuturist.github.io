This notion of a virus seeking to replicate itself in the host cell can metaphorically work on numerous levels to explain the interests of both capitalism and academia (and any of the typical agents of socialization). For example, the project of capitalism essentially functions to produce more capital rather than to produce material goods (Jameson, 1991). Capitalism invades and infects nearly all aspects of American life\u2014work, home, sexuality, relationships, family, education\u2014and works to supplant the priorities of connection, leisure, community, and even personal laziness with the goal of ever-moreefficient production (Deleuze &amp; Guattari, 1988).<\/span><br><br>In this instance, the thinking is muddied considerably. &quot;Capitalism&quot;, as an ideology, cannot infect an institution in the same way feminism can because while feminism is an ideology capitalism is merely supposed to describe a certain mode of production.

Note that this model also assumes that students do not merely receive information as in the more traditional disciplines but instead that they utilize information and knowledge systems to develop particular skills, intentions, and insurrectionary priorities; further, students do form coalitions with professors and other students to promote progressive fields and to enact institutional and social change (Arthur, 2012; Rojas, 2007).<\/span><br><br>The consequences for the funding of women&#039;s study program and for the way we should act toward these &quot;students&quot; (aka. parasite or viruses) is rather clear.","time":1490355158,"resto":118070243,"id":"yAqxPYcA","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118071751,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)07:35:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118071530\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118071530<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;These infectious students, carrying the blueprints of feminist pedagogies, step into other programs and reconstitute themselves through the work they submit and through interaction with instructors and student peers.

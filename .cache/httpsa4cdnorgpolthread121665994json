Maybe we can help anons avoid certain places.<br><br>Personally, I have not yet had a God-awful travelling experience. But if I were to pick the worst place I&#039;ve ever been to it would be this little city in the Northeast of Brazil called Ilheus. I only stayed a couple of days there but it was just a bad experience. The hotel was dirty and old and it faced a beach that had a sewer pipe dumping shit into the water. Besides that, the city was uneventful and its biggest tourist highlight is to visit some shitty cocoa farms.<br><br>Pic related is the hotel I stayed in, don&#039;t go there.","filename":"Ilheus-Opaba-Praia-Hotel-Vista-Exterior","ext":".jpg","w":400,"h":300,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1492510392824,"time":1492510392,"md5":"1LSGCaI28MOqBqA67InOwA==","fsize":34395,"resto":0,"id":"rEVYJAAc","country":"AU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"worst-places-youve-ever-been-to","country_name":"Australia","replies":17,"images":2,"unique_ips":18},{"no":121666309,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)06:16:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121665994\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121665994<\/a><br>Seattle.

Besides that, the city was uneventful and its biggest tourist highlight is to visit some shitty cocoa farms.<br><br>Pic related is the hotel I stayed in, don&#039;t go there.","filename":"Ilheus-Opaba-Praia-Hotel-Vista-Exterior","ext":".jpg","w":400,"h":300,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1492510392824,"time":1492510392,"md5":"1LSGCaI28MOqBqA67InOwA==","fsize":34395,"resto":0,"id":"rEVYJAAc","country":"AU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"worst-places-youve-ever-been-to","country_name":"Australia","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

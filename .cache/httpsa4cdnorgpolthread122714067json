We had no gun laws to speak of until 1939 indeed, then all guns were outlawed and confiscated by the gendermarie, however it wasn&#039;t nazis, but the leftist government in power at the time. Supposedly because they feared insurrection in dire times of war, food shortages, etc, but many historians have linked it to the left&#039;s willingness to surrender to nazi Germany before the fight even started. Then the nazis durring occupation decided that owning a gun would be punished by the death penalty. After the end of the war, those laws were used as the basis for our gun laws up untill 2012 (and they still haven&#039;t changed much) : restriction of military calibers, etc. Up until 1995 and 1998 indeed, we could buy unregistered AR15&#039;s without any licensing or anything, chambered in civilian calibers such as .222 though, as we needed an authorization to get any gun in a military caliber, or any handgun.

Analysts have been scratching their heads wondering why on earth Trump would attack a Russian ally and frustrate Russia\u2019s geopolitical goals in the Middle East.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Matthews thinks the attack is a diversion and is not meant to actually do lasting harm to the Russian-Syrian coalition. He believes that Trump will use military action to end the Trump-Russia scandal and then resume his cozy relationship with Moscow on the down low.<\/span><br><br>It&#039;s funny how the more savvy liberals see what so many here \/pol\/ do not understand. But the difference is that the libtards genuinely believe Trump to be a manchurian candidate while we know he just wants peace and cooperation with Russia, and the libtards see that as a bad thing while we see it as a no-brainer good thing","filename":"1478921394068","ext":".jpg","w":793,"h":796,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491717080927,"time":1491717080,"md5":"5u42NgIXW8X4NeykXfjxZA==","fsize":171949,"resto":0,"id":"GJoY+Z\/X","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"msnbc-just-revealed-what-may-be-the-real-motive","country_name":"United States","replies":9,"images":2,"unique_ips":8},{"no":120247554,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)02:02:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"And yet here I am agreeing with you.

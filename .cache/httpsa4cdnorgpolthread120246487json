Analysts have been scratching their heads wondering why on earth Trump would attack a Russian ally and frustrate Russia\u2019s geopolitical goals in the Middle East.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Matthews thinks the attack is a diversion and is not meant to actually do lasting harm to the Russian-Syrian coalition.

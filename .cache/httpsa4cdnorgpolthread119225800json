Basis of philosophical thought in creating an existence that allows humanity to thrive. <br><br>Section 1: Welcome to Not Nothing- The duality of human nature- rejection and destruction, or acceptance and building given the inherent structure of existence which is- &quot;We have free will, we are not all powerful, we are not all knowing, and we experience the universe with a biological framework and consciousness.&quot; <br><br>Section 2: Destruction and Building- Cultivating power, facing powerlessness. Path of destruction involves a lack of self-control, courage, wonder, and\/or humor, with the person succumbing to powerlessness through either wrath, depression, madness, hedonism, or ignorance due to the lack. Path of building involves self-control, courage, wonder, and a sense of humor. <br><br>Section 3: Power, Biology and Society- Maintaining a strong society(and individual) through a balancing of the pursuance of our animalistic nature completely with a complete rejection, and a balancing of the desire to obtain all-power and a desire to relinquish all power from oneself. A society comprised of men and women pursuing an animalistic sexual nature will crumble. The polar nature of masculinity in men and femininity in women must be upheld. <br><br>Section 4: A World Completely Off the Mark- Application of the philosophy into the areas of Government, Politics, Economics, Agriculture, Environment, Science, Crime and Punishment, Mental Illness, The Media\/Entertainment\/TV\/Internet\/Por<wbr>n\/Advertising, Lack of Freedom\/Technology\/Overpopulation\/O<wbr>vercomplication\/Globalism, and The Exploration of Outer Space.","time":1491158197,"resto":119225800,"id":"NY5QH57U","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119229254,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)14:39:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119225800\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119225800<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;believing in anything<\/span><br>absolutely fucking spooky","filename":"4998","ext":".jpg","w":420,"h":260,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":77,"tim":1491158343062,"time":1491158343,"md5":"rIuSt9GxCiLJweDhXtepGg==","fsize":57417,"resto":119225800,"id":"YJSph6S6","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":119229367,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)14:39:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119228741\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119228741<\/a><br>That was on the website.

Sure there are zoroastrians in Iran(although the relationship between them and the government is very special) or copts in Egypt but there&#039;s few of them. Still, once Islamic governments took power, those minorities were oppressed in one way or another.<br><br>Syria, before the civil war had 2M Christians alone(~10% of the population) and there are huge Islamic sectarian minorities and then there&#039;s Sunni majority. Once Islamists will take power, those will be Sunnis and they&#039;ll start beheading everybody else.

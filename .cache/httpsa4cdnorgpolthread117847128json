I feel I need to share this quote from the first book as it is very appropriate to our current situation. It starts in relation to the world war.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Nobody realized that European man was possessed by something that robbed him of all free will. And this state of unconscious possession will continue undeterred until we Europeans become seared of our &quot;god-almightiness.&quot; Such a change can begin only with individuals, for the masses are blind brutes, as we know to our cost. It seems to me of some importance, therefore, that a few individuals, or people individually, should being to understand that there are contents which do not belong to the ego-personality, but must ascribed to a psychic non-ego. This mental operation has to be undertaken if we want to avoid a threatening inflation. To help us, we have the useful and edifying models held up to us by poets and philosophers-models or archetypi that we may well call remedies for both men and the times. Of course, what we discover there is nothing that can be held up to the masses-only some hidden thing that we can hold up to ourselves in solitude and in silence. Very few people care to know anything about this, it is so much easier to preach the universal panacea to everybody else than to take it oneself, and, as we all know, things are never so bad when everybody is in the same boat. No doubts can exist in the herd; the bigger the crowd the better the truth-and the greater the catastrophe.<\/span><br><br>To make a long story short, and to borrow a phrase from Peterson, sort yourself out.

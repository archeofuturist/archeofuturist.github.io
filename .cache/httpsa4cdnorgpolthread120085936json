They are very easy to spot. They also tend to be anti \/r\/the_donald in order to cause a civil war among our fellow brothers and sisters who have managed to maintain a stronghold on Reddit. Most of \/r\/the_donald are \/pol\/ crossposters so any anti \/r\/the_donald post is an affront at \/pol\/, shills are capitalizing on 4chan&#039;s hatred of reddit to divide us.<br><br>2) Pro-Assad\/pro-Putin shills - any time you see a pro-Assad post there is a 80-85% chance you are speaking from a paid shill from the Kremlin. Studies show that most of the posters from \/sg\/ are from IPs that originate from Moscow, they have been part of \/pol\/ for a while now but lately the Russian government has increased their paychecks so you are seeing a lot more pro-Assad + pro-Putin propaganda posted on here. Be very wary. The remaining 15-20% are just misinformed posters who have fallen for Sputnik\/RT propaganda, so they can be redeemed.<br><br>Last point I want to make is that we are in very chaotic times, shills must understand that \/pol\/ will always stand by Donald J.Trump. No amount of concern trolling will EVER change this.","filename":"Screen-Shot-2016-05-26-at-1.21.42-PM","ext":".png","w":387,"h":469,"tn_w":206,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491625710351,"time":1491625710,"md5":"uGREGtKTlNWxY4P\/XiJnXA==","fsize":378414,"resto":0,"id":"HP5llGxn","country":"AU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"how-to-spot-shills","country_name":"Australia","replies":86,"images":23,"unique_ips":64},{"no":120086265,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)00:31:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120085936\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120085936<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;newfag<\/span><br>Kys","time":1491625872,"resto":120085936,"id":"qd1AEl16","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120086609,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)00:34:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120086265\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120086265<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;newfag<\/span><br>Here we see a shill using words which he doesn&#039;t really understand in order to camouflage his anti-Trump shilling by acting as if he is an oldfag.

My grandfather was one of the chief military figures in developing the neutron bomb in the 50s and early 60s. He went to graduate school for nuclear physics, and they put him on as the military officer in charge of the project (I think we was either a Lt. Colonel or a full Colonel at the time, strangely enough as an armored officer). His team basically brought Cohen&#039;s theories to life as the first generation of high radiation\/low yield thermonuclear devices. Basically, neutron bombs are useful because we can&#039;t just drop a hydrogen bomb on all of our problems. Sometimes you want to go nuclear to show your serious without going top shelf with a 10 megaton device. The neutron bomb solves this by lacking the tamper (usually made of non-reactive U-238) the regular hydrogen bomb does (obviously with other alterations I don&#039;t know about because I&#039;m not a nuclear physics\/don&#039;t have Q clearance with the DOE or TS\/SCI with the DoD). The tamper reflects neutrons back into the reaction of a thermonuclear device causing the reaction to complete more, which means more energy -&gt; a bigger explosion. Without a tamper, the reaction doesn&#039;t reach completion before being blown apart by the energy created, so radioactive isotopes are blown all over the fucking place. Basically, a neutron bomb is kind of like if a dirty bomb fucked a hydrogen bomb and they had a baby.","time":1491633707,"resto":120085936,"id":"STm7Q0l9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120100094,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)02:42:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120099969\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120099969<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;<a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/120099730#p120099999\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120099999<\/a><\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;<a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/120099145#p120100000\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120100000<\/a><\/span>","time":1491633779,"resto":120085936,"id":"4XSZagWC","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120100467,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)02:46:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;120000000<\/span>","time":1491634011,"resto":120085936,"id":"nc4\/+i91","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":120100623,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)02:48:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120085936\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120085936<\/a><br>anyone claiming to be pro anti anything<br><br>and the post is most of the time lame and best of all, waste of their own time cuz<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;we do it for free<\/span>","time":1491634100,"resto":120085936,"id":"1ZcY\/zdV","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":120100632,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)02:48:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120085936\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120085936<\/a><br>you have to go back to plebbit.<br><br><br>n<br>o<br>w<br><br>non negotiable","filename":"genial","ext":".png","w":1000,"h":763,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":95,"tim":1491634106128,"time":1491634106,"md5":"5HStixegv0jPOMT3c\/QmyA==","fsize":78628,"resto":120085936,"id":"OSmoiGIQ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120100844,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)02:50:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"This is what we deserve for letting Reddit in.

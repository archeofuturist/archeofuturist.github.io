I have nothing and am worth much less than someone on welfare, foodstamps or NEET cash. So far I&#039;ve had to pay 6k in Obamacare fines and had to buy the worst insurance imaginable this year because it was cheaper than the fine ($4,000). I eat a perfect diet and go to the gym 5 days a week and haven&#039;t been to a doctor in 10 years. This is money that would have changed my life.","filename":"1484111216360","ext":".png","w":504,"h":942,"tn_w":66,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492202974169,"time":1492202974,"md5":"Fj+cs1Bm1pNTw5SwYDBZ4w==","fsize":788030,"resto":121108393,"id":"qRPBkguS","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121111636,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)16:50:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121109164\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121109164<\/a><br>dude, they had the legislation ready to go to repeal it before trump was even sworn in. instead they fucked around and did nothing","time":1492203054,"resto":121108393,"id":"W0XYfmAg","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121112061,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)16:53:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121108393\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121108393<\/a><br>he made bypass on it. so yea, he actually did do something. https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/forbes\/welco<wbr>me\/?toURL=https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/si<wbr>tes\/kellyphillipserb\/2017\/02\/16\/irs<wbr>-softens-on-obamacare-reporting-req<wbr>uirements-after-trump-executive-ord<wbr>er\/&amp;refURL=https:\/\/www.google.com\/&amp;<wbr>referrer=https:\/\/www.google.com\/","time":1492203233,"resto":121108393,"id":"tOImtzIQ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

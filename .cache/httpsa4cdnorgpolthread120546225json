The one that gets me is ski resorts. Say you buy a full day ticket and at 10 am after a few runs skiing\/boarding you feel a bit tired\/under the weather and decide to go in. Wouldnt it be smart\/effective to sell your lift ticket to somebody just getting to the mountain? I mean, you bought a service, THE SERVICE SHOULD BELONG TO YOU. But if you do sell your ticket you can get arrested and charged with theft of services. Honestly if i ever got busted for that i think id have to kill the resort owners grandkids or something reasonable like that. I honestly think killing the resort owners family is as reasonable as arresting someone for selling something they bought to another person. Anybody else get sickened by the shit large businesses pull?","filename":"IMG_0905","ext":".jpg","w":648,"h":365,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1491881647666,"time":1491881647,"md5":"ARy6F+fIoiOvxSsCV7Y7fQ==","fsize":45939,"resto":0,"id":"fmXM9JES","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"im-a-trump-supporter-but","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":120546495,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)23:36:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120546225\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120546225<\/a><br>shill","time":1491881771,"resto":120546225,"id":"EnYsbu+Y","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120546802,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)23:38:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120546495\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120546495<\/a><br>Fiction can be fun!","time":1491881921,"resto":120546225,"id":"fmXM9JES","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

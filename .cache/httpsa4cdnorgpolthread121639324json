Take also in consideration that in the 50&#039;s most war, even untill veit-fuckin-nam, was fought using mainly ground troops. Best Korea is a very mountainous area, making ground warfare from troops to mech infantry, very hard. We however have moved onto a very advanced AirForce. We don&#039;t rely much on ground unless its for the taking of citys, making forward bases and the such. Drones, Airpower, and sea based missile attacks, and even perhaps the use of ultra long range Rail Cannons, would decimate their 50&#039;s era ground forces. The real issue would be a gorilla fighting campaign designed to whittle down our military, such as the case in middle east and veitcong. Eventually the army will starve, eventually any mobile platforms will run out of fuel. You would see some desperation fighting giving them +2 combat, but that bonus would only last so long, they would then collapse. That is of course baring any Russia\/China backup, which is up to debate.","filename":"1291182960835","ext":".jpg","w":1680,"h":1050,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":78,"tim":1492491989886,"time":1492491989,"md5":"c2vbU4nr0qk9QjV0eMVXlw==","fsize":133203,"resto":121639324,"id":"fMi2GA6r","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":121641912,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)01:06:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121641598\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121641598<\/a><br>It&#039;s a state vs state scenario, who the fuck will feed and equip the &quot;guerrillas&quot; after the dissolution of the state","time":1492491999,"resto":121639324,"id":"ybR9xACo","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121641967,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)01:07:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121641805\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121641805<\/a><br>Japs did the same shit, we just threw obnoxious amounts of tear gas in the tunnels to force them out","time":1492492025,"resto":121639324,"id":"P+a6peZg","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121641985,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)01:07:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121641652\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121641652<\/a><br>200,000 wounded or dead, us only has so many poor to die for wars fought for imperislism.","time":1492492034,"resto":121639324,"id":"kadWQdNh","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121642010,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)01:07:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121641849\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121641849<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I have<\/span><br>I&#039;m a rocketship captain.

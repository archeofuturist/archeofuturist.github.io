This thread is not about the reasons behind the war in syria or why the west and Israel wants Assad out.<br><br>Who are syrian refugees: they are families that fled conflict to avoid being casualties in the war between the syrian government and the rebels or being killed by rebels for being moderate sunnites, christians, alawites or shiites. The second reason is that many fled the country to avoid serving in the syrian army alone or with their families.<br><br>You have to understand that those refugees aren&#039;t not the ones responsible for the terrorism happening across the world. Most of them want to go back to syria once the war is over, because they have family there, they still have their home there and want to rebuilt Syria.<br><br>4 out of 5 immigrant in Europe are not war refugee they came from other middle-eastern countries(north africa, turkey, Afghanistan, bangladesh, etc) for social benefits and are using the war in syria as a way to pretend to be a war refugee. They are the rapefugees and sandniggers responsible for Europe being so fucked up right now.<br><br>Getting rid of Assad will only fuel the immigrant and refugee problem, Syrian will continue to escape Syria and other sandniggers will continue to come to Europe pretending to be war refugee for welfare and white women. Middle-east countries can&#039;t be stables under democracy, the only stability comes from dictators or royal rulers, that are willing to get their hands dirty to get rid of anything opposing stability including extremism Islam.<br><br>Supporting Assad doesn&#039;t mean you have to give up on Trump, his plan about Syria has yet to be revealed, so stop turning against Trump and get your shit together because it&#039;s too soon.<br><br>Now fuck the shills and fuck the kikes.","filename":"syria-destroyed","ext":".jpg","w":598,"h":306,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":127,"tim":1491675188425,"time":1491675188,"md5":"1xQpNROcvSuK43Y4pcPh6w==","fsize":44896,"resto":0,"id":"9K8LPeVK","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"redpill-syria-and-our-refugee-problem","country_name":"Canada","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":120162096,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)14:15:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"A","time":1491675303,"resto":120161863,"id":"xvzHYinW","country":"CR","country_name":"Costa Rica"}]}

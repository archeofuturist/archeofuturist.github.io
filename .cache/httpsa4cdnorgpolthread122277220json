The way you destroy his will to fight is through utter humiliation and existential hopelessness.

And for another thing, the total number of casualties is less important than the psychological effect they had on the Axis vs. the Allies. <br><br>Taking massive casualties in a battle you ultimately won can be heroic and a morale booster (i.e., Normandy, Bastogne, etc.). Taking massive casualties while losing or retreating is another matter entirely. Ultimately, the Axis will to fight was destroyed by making the war too horrible for them to endure any longer -- Dresden was a fatal blow to the Germans even though it wasn&#039;t a military target, and Hiroshima\/Nagasaki basically shattered the Japanese psyche overnight.

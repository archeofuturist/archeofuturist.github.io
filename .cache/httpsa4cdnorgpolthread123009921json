What this anon said is mostly true, except the &quot;alcoholism is non existant&quot; is false, we were getting drunk with our tour group and guides every night.

It was only when I went there I noticed that every mainstream media report I have seen on NK has just simply not been true.

It&#039;s really that simple. Instead turn around and with your back facing the flag and the USMC Officers present fold your arms and SPEAK NOTHING. Remain SILENT! Then when these uppity bastards ask you to get on the bus you tell themthis word for word: &quot;Sir, I DID NOT RAISE MY HAND, NOR HAVE I TAKEN AN LEGAL OATH TO THE USA NOR HAVE I SURRENDERED MY LEGAL STATUS TO THE UCMJ. YOU HAVE NO LEGAL RIGHT NOR ACTION THEREFORE TO INDUCT ME INTO THE ARMED FORCES OF THE UNITED STATES.&quot; - You will then be asked to leave and given a ration of shit while the rest of the fools will be on the bus on their way to Boot Camp.<br><br>My grandfather who was called to serve in Vietnam did EXACTLY THIS IN 1970 when he was 18 an called to report for service.

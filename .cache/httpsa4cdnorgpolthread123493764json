And as part of this there is the whole brown invasion of the west shit with all their backwards cultures and retarded people as baggage. <br><br>But I&#039;ve noticed that whenever this gets brought up, the jew instinctively relies almost entirely on the fucking ethnic food meme. Whenever I talk about how syrians are terrorist and killing the dumb europeans who let them in, they say shit like &quot;Have you tried So-and-so Kabob? It&#039;s fucking great!&quot; They say they know muzzies are generally shit, and straight up admit it, but then they&#039;ll say they have this one muzzie friend who runs this ethnic food market, and how great the Lebanese Hummus is. They seek to disarm your legitimate view of your own destruction by appealing to your hunger?

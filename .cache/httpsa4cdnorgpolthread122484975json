Both words are normally used in so vague a way that any definition is liable to be challenged, but one must draw a distinction between them, since two different and even opposing ideas are involved. By \u2018patriotism\u2019 I mean devotion to a particular place and a particular way of life, which one believes to be the best in the world but has no wish to force on other people. Patriotism is of its nature defensive, both militarily and culturally. Nationalism, on the other hand, is inseparable from the desire for power. The abiding purpose of every nationalist is to secure more power and more prestige, not for himself but for the nation or other unit in which he has chosen to sink his own individuality.<\/span>","time":1492981875,"resto":122484975,"id":"BTiK3Ulq","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122489148,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)17:17:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122487784\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122487784<\/a><br>Easy there Sweden.","time":1492982242,"resto":122484975,"id":"7DLBTB62","country":"RO","country_name":"Romania"},{"no":122489216,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)17:17:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122485629\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122485629<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; a married woman of three<\/span><br><br>The french will vote in office a literal cuckhold !","time":1492982262,"resto":122484975,"id":"0G4tP+J7","country":"CY","country_name":"Cyprus"},{"no":122489389,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)17:19:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122484975\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122484975<\/a><br>How can one be patriotic without loving their nation?

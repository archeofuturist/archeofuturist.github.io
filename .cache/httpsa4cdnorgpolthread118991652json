The survey found that 20% of millennials identify as openly LGBT, while only 7% of the baby boomer generation (ages 52\u201371) would openly label themselves as such. Acceptance of the LGBT community was also found to be at an all-time high.<br><br>&quot;America is the most accepting that it has ever been. Having 20% of millennials identify as LGBTQ is pretty groundbreaking,&quot; Sarah Kate Ellis, GLAAD&#039;s president and CEO, told BuzzFeed News. &quot;What I want to see is that they continue to flourish and blossom as their true and authentic selves.&quot;<br><br>The survey also found that 12% of millennials identify outside the gender binary, as either transgender or gender-nonconforming.<br><br>But although more young people openly identify as LGBT, the study found that non-LGBT millennials are less likely to know someone who identifies as simply \u201cgay\u201d or \u201clesbian.&quot;<br><br>The study found that an overwhelming 63% of young people identify as allies to the queer community. While that age group was the most likely to be accepting, the majority (53%) of Generation X and the majority (51%) of baby boomers were also likely to consider themselves allies.","filename":"lgbt","ext":".png","w":1600,"h":630,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":98,"tim":1490919200190,"time":1490919200,"md5":"+LHoRw5mnUtuC1FQLB1LBA==","fsize":73492,"resto":0,"id":"+KrJFtaU","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"adults-1834-twice-as-likely-as-previous","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

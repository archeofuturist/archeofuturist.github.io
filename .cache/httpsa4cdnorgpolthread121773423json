At the face of it, this one made no sense. Unlike in Iran, the ruling party in Tunisia (at the time) had strong connections to the US and there was no logical reason for the US to want it out of power. But this isn\u2019t about logic but emotions, specifically, the emotions of the Arab population and the decision making process of rulers around the world. The leaked US Embassy cables were extremely embarrassing to the Tunisian government as it detailed US-Tunisian anti-terrorism cooperation that many in the mostly banned Muslim Brotherhood off-shoots (such as AQIM) saw as treachery. Whether it was decided to deliberately leak these cables or not cannot be proven. What is undeniable is that they lit the fire that started the Arab Spring, in 2010.<br><br>By the middle of January, 2011, the ruling party in Tunisia collapsed under waves of mostly Islamist and useful idiots helping them. Days later, long-time US and Israeli Egyptian ally Mubarak came under a similar but far more coordinated social media attack. Congregating around accounts such as j-n25voic-s(*) and others, the twitter and Facebook spheres encouraged mass-demonstrations in Cairo and other cities. The Egyptian government pulled the plug on the internet, but this backfired thanks to a kind of Streisand effect where an act of mass-censorship only makes a public revolt worse. The whole world was watching Al Jazeera and similar channels and celebrated when Mubarak stepped down after Obama asked him to.","filename":"IqS2bzo","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":500,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492566142703,"time":1492566142,"md5":"d0nP2z\/FnYaBp2ddnlu95Q==","fsize":51434,"resto":121773423,"id":"hP6D9Bhs","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121780222,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)21:42:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"LARP THREAD CONFIRMED<br>So you know nothing about Indigo Knight and nothing about Black Eagle<br>These are two of the most comprehensive intelligence sharing programs that took place over the past 3 decades and you know NOTHING about them?<br>Bull shit you fucking Faker<br>This is a slide thread","time":1492566149,"resto":121773423,"id":"9ir7H\/sg","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121780246,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)21:42:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121773423\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121773423<\/a><br>This guy explains it all pretty well and confirms satanists, zionists, mind control and child offerings and abuse.<br>He used to work for the top 1%.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;https:\/\/vimeo.com\/212237317<\/span>","filename":"Ronald Bernard","ext":".jpg","w":200,"h":200,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492566160881,"time":1492566160,"md5":"nsWYVNpkvIqegW5iTrQJow==","fsize":6706,"resto":121773423,"id":"i1kUlfvM","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":121780255,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)21:42:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121777284\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121777284<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;It&#039;s the tip of the iceberg and I hope SK prosecutors dig deep, but I doubt much will be done to be honest.<\/span><br><br>It connects to Merkel &amp; HRC.<br><br>It won&#039;t be followed.","time":1492566163,"resto":121773423,"id":"3QtvOgmX","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121780258,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)21:42:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121779508\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121779508<\/a><br>arent literally all of our current secondary schooling issues a direct result of govt institutions investing in our public institutions through the combination of direct spending and nondischargable loans","time":1492566165,"resto":121773423,"id":"J+On0Eip","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121780311,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)21:43:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121780056\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121780056<\/a><br><br>Saving?","time":1492566184,"resto":121773423,"id":"c2Us2G8a","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121780328,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)21:43:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;lied about Hoffa drinking Vodka drinks<\/span><br>He was a whiskey drinker<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;prove your not LARPing<\/span><br>Now then, what about the Ayyyy lmaos, hmm?","time":1492566191,"resto":121773423,"id":"lLUPHr+\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121780451,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)21:44:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121780067\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121780067<\/a><br><br>Where does Comey honestly stand?

Russian troops stationed in Crimea, aided by special forces that infiltrated all government sectors with the support of most of the local population, took over Crimea without firing a single bullet. Though not ideal, this was just the incident needed by the US to turn around the \u201cgood faith\u201d among people Russia had been brewing on the internet for years.<br><br>Months before the fake chemical weapons attack in Syria, an important event occured that most geopolitical analysts misinterpreted: The Snowden surveillance leaks. Those concerned with foreign policy said that Snowden, being originally a CIA agent ], was still working for them and was attempting to brew bad relations with either Russia or China where he originally escaped to. This theory is patently false, the leaks were far heavier and had a much larger shift in public perception than relatively simple and lower classification embassy cable leak. The Snowden leaks were all TOP SECRET and hugely damaging to the NSA and SIGINT organizations around the world. As an important aside, it had no effect on HUMINT organizations such as the CIA, that have different, more tradational and arguably more reliable means of collecting information and ensuring OPSEC.<br><br>Those concerned with domestic policy were too busy reacting to the leaks with disdain to really understand the purpose behind them. The information that was leaked detailed the general idea behind decrypting secure communication, splicing undersea cables and mass surveillance.","filename":"BlJzKwP","ext":".png","w":450,"h":659,"tn_w":85,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492566737869,"time":1492566737,"md5":"x\/0EPpjIR7hIC22sptCazw==","fsize":405596,"resto":121773423,"id":"hP6D9Bhs","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121781590,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)21:52:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121773423\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121773423<\/a><br>Do you know WTF is going on down in Antartica?

Instead of the majority of relatively poorer people taking those with a truly privileged position (the elite\/wealthy) to task, the majority gets locked in a war among each other. Male against female, black against white and so on. A lukewarm civil war now brews in the west with both \u201cright\u201d wing and \u201cleft\u201d (identity politics) wing elements.

Where the \u201cleft\u201d fails (as it has in the case of GamerGate), selective enforcement and institutional corruption is used to set a narrative that allows them to effectively bypass reality. The \u201cleft\u201d is chosen not out of preference of the elite, but because the logical conclusion is pure nihilism and complete chaos among the poor and middle class families in the US.<br><br>At the same time, the same mechanisations that favour the SJW narrative are used to cover up the international realities that ultimately effect western citizens.

These issues are indeed important, but without the context of the bigger picture, the blame is incorrectly directed at the mechanizations rather the mechanizers.

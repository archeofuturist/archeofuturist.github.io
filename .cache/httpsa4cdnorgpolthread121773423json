At the face of it, this one made no sense. Unlike in Iran, the ruling party in Tunisia (at the time) had strong connections to the US and there was no logical reason for the US to want it out of power. But this isn\u2019t about logic but emotions, specifically, the emotions of the Arab population and the decision making process of rulers around the world. The leaked US Embassy cables were extremely embarrassing to the Tunisian government as it detailed US-Tunisian anti-terrorism cooperation that many in the mostly banned Muslim Brotherhood off-shoots (such as AQIM) saw as treachery. Whether it was decided to deliberately leak these cables or not cannot be proven. What is undeniable is that they lit the fire that started the Arab Spring, in 2010.<br><br>By the middle of January, 2011, the ruling party in Tunisia collapsed under waves of mostly Islamist and useful idiots helping them. Days later, long-time US and Israeli Egyptian ally Mubarak came under a similar but far more coordinated social media attack. Congregating around accounts such as j-n25voic-s(*) and others, the twitter and Facebook spheres encouraged mass-demonstrations in Cairo and other cities. The Egyptian government pulled the plug on the internet, but this backfired thanks to a kind of Streisand effect where an act of mass-censorship only makes a public revolt worse. The whole world was watching Al Jazeera and similar channels and celebrated when Mubarak stepped down after Obama asked him to.","filename":"IqS2bzo","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":500,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492566142703,"time":1492566142,"md5":"d0nP2z\/FnYaBp2ddnlu95Q==","fsize":51434,"resto":121773423,"id":"hP6D9Bhs","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121780222,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)21:42:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"LARP THREAD CONFIRMED<br>So you know nothing about Indigo Knight and nothing about Black Eagle<br>These are two of the most comprehensive intelligence sharing programs that took place over the past 3 decades and you know NOTHING about them?<br>Bull shit you fucking Faker<br>This is a slide thread","time":1492566149,"resto":121773423,"id":"9ir7H\/sg","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121780246,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)21:42:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121773423\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121773423<\/a><br>This guy explains it all pretty well and confirms satanists, zionists, mind control and child offerings and abuse.<br>He used to work for the top 1%.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;https:\/\/vimeo.com\/212237317<\/span>","filename":"Ronald Bernard","ext":".jpg","w":200,"h":200,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492566160881,"time":1492566160,"md5":"nsWYVNpkvIqegW5iTrQJow==","fsize":6706,"resto":121773423,"id":"i1kUlfvM","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":121780255,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)21:42:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121777284\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121777284<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;It&#039;s the tip of the iceberg and I hope SK prosecutors dig deep, but I doubt much will be done to be honest.<\/span><br><br>It connects to Merkel &amp; HRC.<br><br>It won&#039;t be followed.","time":1492566163,"resto":121773423,"id":"3QtvOgmX","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121780258,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)21:42:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121779508\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121779508<\/a><br>arent literally all of our current secondary schooling issues a direct result of govt institutions investing in our public institutions through the combination of direct spending and nondischargable loans","time":1492566165,"resto":121773423,"id":"J+On0Eip","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121780311,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)21:43:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121780056\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121780056<\/a><br><br>Saving?","time":1492566184,"resto":121773423,"id":"c2Us2G8a","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121780328,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)21:43:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;lied about Hoffa drinking Vodka drinks<\/span><br>He was a whiskey drinker<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;prove your not LARPing<\/span><br>Now then, what about the Ayyyy lmaos, hmm?","time":1492566191,"resto":121773423,"id":"lLUPHr+\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121780451,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)21:44:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121780067\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121780067<\/a><br><br>Where does Comey honestly stand?

Iran was ecstatic, knowing that an Islamist government will inevitably come into power now that the military run government had collapsed under the wave of popular revolt. Knowing that Egypt was a long-time US ally, they concluded that the social media attack against the Egyptian government was grass root based. This couldn\u2019t be further from the truth and underestimating US-planning would cost all these states dearly. The Muslim Brotherhood was now aligned with the US and was simply carrying out the original plans in 2006, that started the coordinated attack against the US dollar.<br><br>In February 17th, simultaneous \u201cDays of rage\u201d were announced in Syria and Libya. The Syrian \u201cday of rage\u201d fizzled out thanks to (then) strong security apparatus that monitored the internet and preempted all security breaches. Libya was a different matter. It almost immediately escalated to an armed conflict where the army had split. The US and France brought a \u201chumanitarian\u201d proposal to the UNSC to enforce a no-fly zone on Libya that Russia and China defacto-accepted. France immediately broke the terms of the resolution to attack the Libyan army on the ground and destroy its infrastructure. Barely sobering up from its celebrations, China left North Africa with its tail behinds its legs","filename":"ipxiIlh","ext":".png","w":488,"h":7664,"tn_w":7,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492566285784,"time":1492566285,"md5":"CqRKJ7Td2zeT8P5jv8CyEQ==","fsize":292050,"resto":121773423,"id":"hP6D9Bhs","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

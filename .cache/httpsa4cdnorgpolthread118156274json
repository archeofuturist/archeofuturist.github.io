House Intelligence Committee chairman Devin Nunes told reporters yesterday that members of Donald Trump\u2019s presidential transition team \u2014 including Trump himself \u2014 may have been caught up in surveillance during the last days of the Obama administration. \u201cI have seen intelligence reports that clearly show that the president-elect and his team were, I guess, at least, monitored, and disseminated out . . . in intelligence channels,\u201d Nunes said. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;He stressed that the surveillance, by both the FBI and NSA, looked to be legal \u201cincidental collection\u201d that had nothing to do with concerns over Russia collusion. If true, this isn\u2019t the wiretapping of Trump Tower, as Trump claimed in his infamous tweet a few weeks ago, but it is spying in any commonly understood sense of the word. The NSA routinely listens to calls and reads e-mails of Americans and collects other data \u201cincidentally\u201d from third parties, avoiding warrants. Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which has been found constitutional, states that government doesn\u2019t need a warrant to collect information on Americans as long as the target of the collection is a foreigner.<\/span><br><br>http:\/\/www.nationalreview.com\/artic<wbr>le\/446040\/trump-spying-fbi-nsa","time":1490401069,"resto":118156274,"id":"7fF7eKzW","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118156898,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)20:17:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118156868\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118156868<\/a><br>why is alex such a pussy?","time":1490401073,"resto":118156274,"id":"F0E+HrHy","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118156925,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)20:18:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;118156814<\/span><br><span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;118156779<\/span><br>you niggers need to calm down","filename":"1485155653300","ext":".jpg","w":625,"h":626,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490401086769,"time":1490401086,"md5":"fbb3TDSlHw1f\/6kQyqRZdA==","fsize":172732,"resto":118156274,"id":"oyx54LJt","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118156929,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)20:18:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;l-losing is winning!<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;h-he wanted it to fail, forget that he vehemently endorsed it!<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;th-this is just 4d checkers!<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;th-this will be forgotten in a week<\/span><br>THE FUCKING RUN DOWN APARTMENT COMPLEX OF TRUMPKEKS HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH<wbr>AHAHAHAHAH","filename":"1490140316811","ext":".png","w":660,"h":473,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":89,"tim":1490401089187,"time":1490401089,"md5":"99qPjDHvPpk5dy\/nwR9MMw==","fsize":547313,"resto":118156274,"id":"K\/5vIESe","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118156939,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)20:18:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118156837\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118156837<\/a><br>Open hearing changed to closed hearing","time":1490401096,"resto":118156274,"id":"ncEjR\/mw","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118156940,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)20:18:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;118156814<\/span><br>You fucked up, sorry I&#039;m staying put","time":1490401096,"resto":118156274,"id":"oiS38Exm","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118156951,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)20:18:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;118156779<\/span><br>et tu americanus?","time":1490401102,"resto":118156274,"id":"G8jKZszX","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":118157005,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)20:18:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;118156626<\/span><br>I appreciate your enthusiasm, but this bread has a certain je ne quois to it that gives it an edge over yours.

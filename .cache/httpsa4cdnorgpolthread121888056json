This is ridiculous - it was unsafe to loudly proclaim as much ten years ago but it has never been a mystery. The immigration policies alone REQUIRE an exit from the EU, as the EU controls the border. Calling for a referendum on the EU in France is akin to calling for an exit, only instead of dictating for the people she gives them the choice. Whenever it has been put to vote it has turned out against and that was in much better times! Le Pen is a french traditionalist if anything - she represents the opposite of Hamon and Hollande types who are cucks. Fillon and Macron represent various versions of globalist rule, Fillon being more like a Cuckservative and Macron more like a Democrat. Melenchon is Bernie Sanders if he were competent (still wrong though). The best result is Melenchon\/Le Pen in run-off because Melenchon is truly the only un-electable of the four. Thsi is not because &quot;the system&quot; is against him or in favor of Le Pen, but rather because his proposals are very radical and drastic and the French have done that once before in 1981 when Mitterand was first elected. ZERO people over age 55 will vote for Melenchon, no matter what lies they tell their grandkids. Le Pen has a very good chance to win against all three - this is why they&#039;re trying so hard to fuck her in the first round. If they were sure she&#039;d lose, they&#039;d want her in the 2nd round. For those who don&#039;t understand French, realize that Le Pen is very well spoken and does a tremendous job making her arguments. She&#039;s eloquent as fuck and very credible, not at all wish-washy like the shill is suggesting. We know what she represents and it looks better by the day.","filename":"1489346516098","ext":".jpg","w":300,"h":295,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":122,"tim":1492644701132,"time":1492644701,"md5":"lGo54LN6d4C7NnwBY3LY\/A==","fsize":14745,"resto":121888056,"id":"KBQiXyKQ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121915782,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)19:31:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121915319\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121915319<\/a><br>Cloudy before The Don.","time":1492644705,"resto":121888056,"id":"IFUz42Gu","country":"CH","country_name":"Switzerland"},{"no":121916017,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)19:33:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121915320\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121915320<\/a><br>She always say what&#039;s wrong with it but never said once the only solution is to leave it.

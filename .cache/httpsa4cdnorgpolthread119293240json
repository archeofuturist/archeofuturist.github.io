Tell your members of Congress to vote no on H.J. Res. 46!<br><br>There are more than 40 national parks around the U.S. in which the federal government owns the surface but not the rights to the minerals underneath. Congressman Paul Gosar of Arizona recently introduced legislation that would repeal a rule designed to provide reasonable safeguards from private oil and gas development within national parks \u2013 places cherished both within the United States and around the world for their protected, pristine states and incredible recreation opportunities. His hope is that the previous administration\u2019s final efforts to improve those safeguards will be rolled back, revoking the National Park Service\u2019s new authorities over oil &amp; gas drilling and leaving them unable to enact any similar regulations or new safety standards unless Congress explicitly authorizes them to \u2013 and we know how unlikely that is.<br><br>Our National Parks are celebrated worldwide, and we assume that our representatives want to keep them in pristine shape for generations to come \u2013 given that 86% of Americans of all stripes want to keep them free of oil &amp; gas drilling. Just not Congressman Gosar, who\u2019s received almost $250,000 from oil and gas interests in his last four election campaigns.<br><br>Tell Congress \u2013 no drilling in our National Parks!","filename":"@mx_900 (2)","ext":".jpg","w":899,"h":599,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":166,"tim":1491195781991,"time":1491195781,"md5":"qX2PibJhHC42oUBRNS+BpA==","fsize":52101,"resto":0,"id":"ZwsTsJsc","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"a-bill-has-been-introduced-that-would-roll-back","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":119293357,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)01:04:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119293240\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119293240<\/a><br> <br>fuck parks. drill for oil.","time":1491195870,"resto":119293240,"id":"ViWnm82m","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119293660,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)01:08:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119293240\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119293240<\/a><br>Why should a bureaucracy filled with unelected career appointees be in charge of regulating anything?

to the stupidest people in America, Niggers. They hate that we 4chan-browsing and Alex Jones-listening rural conservative &quot;whiteys&quot; are the winners in a manufacturing-based localised ethnically homogeneous society because of our higher brain capacity and education, and they blame all their failures on whites and structural racism. They are seeing how America is increasingly becoming right-wing, and how non-whites will hang on the day of the rope, and losing their benefits terrifies them. They see Obama as the saviour that will somehow make America go back to how it was in the 2000s, when in reality there is no going back because the values of Christianity, Peter Hitchens, YKTD, hate and xenophobia are the right side of history.","time":1491325618,"resto":119486292,"id":"w9mh9NqT","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119489752,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)13:07:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119489296\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119489296<\/a><br>no saw it on the chapo subreddit, the post is being mocked by the entire political spectrum","time":1491325623,"resto":119486292,"id":"54F5ktc2","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119489805,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)13:07:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119489584\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119489584<\/a><br>Awesome, I remember playing dizzy on that bad boy","time":1491325653,"resto":119486292,"id":"UGoIJn4r","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119489845,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)13:08:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119489321\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119489321<\/a><br>Asuka is trash desu","time":1491325682,"resto":119486292,"id":"GbUv\/X6S","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119489886,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)13:08:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119489740\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119489740<\/a><br>Karen a CUTE!","time":1491325702,"resto":119486292,"id":"fB68LP3V","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119489894,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)13:08:27","name":"WN","com":"<a href=\"#p119489729\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119489729<\/a><br>True, a lot of conservatives started out as mildly libertarian.","time":1491325707,"resto":119486292,"id":"tQvlJWSu","country":"GB","trip":"!!XKy4PC1RH+2","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119490010,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)13:09:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119486292\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119486292<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;May to raise &#039;hard issues&#039; with Saudi Arabia, stand up for UK interests<\/span><br><br>&quot;Buy moar gunz Saudi&quot; - Theresa May 2017<br><br>I suppose it&#039;s technically standing up for British interests.","time":1491325780,"resto":119486292,"id":"IxL60d5C","country":"SI","country_name":"Slovenia"},{"no":119490081,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)13:10:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"Befriend anyone you think may have a future political career and find out their juicy secrets.

I was raised an edgy secular fag, and was honestly incredibly cringeworthy about it in retrospect. Then I made friends with this guy who was really religious, and after &quot;picking his arguments apart&quot; he asked me to just honestly, sincerely give it a go.<br><br>A few days later I smoked a bowl (was still using drugs at that point) I turned off the light, sat down on the floor, put my hands together, and prayed. Something along the lines of &quot;If the lord Jesus Christ is truly real, and you can hear me, please give me a sign.&quot;<br><br>Then I felt it, what people talk about when they say they feel the &quot;Holy Spirit.&quot; But, more, a voice that was, for lack of a better understanding, external. From outside of me. NOT my internal monologue. <br><br>I then asked &quot;Why all the bad in the world?&quot; <br><br>A response. <br><br>&quot;So humanity can learn from their mistakes.&quot;<br><br>Take that to mean what you will, but after that I was and am still sure that Jesus Christ is real. Like, really real. I&#039;m not here to get into an ontological argument with anyone or prove myself or anything, I&#039;ll be leaving this thread after this post. But my point is this: <br><br>Without an ABSOLUTELY open mind, true faith that something that you do not believe in MAY perhaps be real, you&#039;re approaching it in the wrong way. I had tried praying many times since I was a child, and it was only in my 20s that I truly found God. And it was good.<br><br>Side note about the voice: imagine Elohim from The Talos Principle (don&#039;t accuse me of transference, or do idc, but I hadn&#039;t played that game until after I had my religious experience. Basically kinda like that.) Loud, authoritative, not necessarily kind or unkind. Just... There.

The apostles died without getting rich, getting a girlfriend or getting power, they all died horribly. There was no point in spreading Christianity if they didn&#039;t believe in it. Why would they risk their life if it wasn&#039;t true? Why would they risk their life if it was all forged? Why would Paul try to join this new small church?<br>Also the only accounts of Romans getting Christians to change their faith was after the 1st century. No account of eyewitnesses ever changing their story.","time":1493091701,"resto":122674609,"id":"RH2zSqol","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122687413,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)23:42:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122687363\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122687363<\/a><br><a href=\"#p122674609\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122674609<\/a><br>Other videos:<br>New Testament Reliability:<br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=rml<wbr>5Cif01g4 <br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=WYE<wbr>zxD2kcGQ <br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=vCp<wbr>-ayAp7fE <br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=_l0<wbr>Say2wMw0 <br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=qId<wbr>CRanZZyw <br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=cv6<wbr>JHGfB9Sk <br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=gld<wbr>vim1yjYM<br><br>Credit to based Polish anon for the copy paste","time":1493091730,"resto":122674609,"id":"RH2zSqol","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122687422,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)23:42:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122674609\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122674609<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;two and a half women<\/span>","time":1493091733,"resto":122674609,"id":"4A\/6zcjo","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122687477,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)23:42:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"Pray and ask. Christ told us &quot;Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you&quot; in Matthew 7:7. It is also written &quot;If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.&quot; In James 1:7. <br><br>Follow this advice, and ask with a heart open and contrite to have the truth revealed to you. If you do this, the holy spirit will testify to you of our heavenly father and Jesus Christ. You just have to want to truly know, and then ask, and it will be revealed to you. And what higher form of faith and testimony can you have than one revealed to your direct experience by God himself?","time":1493091761,"resto":122674609,"id":"MarBRpTF","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122687538,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)23:43:20","name":"Anonymous","filename":"maxresdefault","ext":".jpg","w":1660,"h":935,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1493091800361,"time":1493091800,"md5":"j56ITzDHN4tm0KJvsHNq+A==","fsize":147123,"resto":122674609,"id":"iQwz9G4y","country":"GB","m_img":1,"country_name":"United Kingdom"}]}

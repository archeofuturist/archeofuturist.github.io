I was raised an edgy secular fag, and was honestly incredibly cringeworthy about it in retrospect. Then I made friends with this guy who was really religious, and after &quot;picking his arguments apart&quot; he asked me to just honestly, sincerely give it a go.<br><br>A few days later I smoked a bowl (was still using drugs at that point) I turned off the light, sat down on the floor, put my hands together, and prayed. Something along the lines of &quot;If the lord Jesus Christ is truly real, and you can hear me, please give me a sign.&quot;<br><br>Then I felt it, what people talk about when they say they feel the &quot;Holy Spirit.&quot; But, more, a voice that was, for lack of a better understanding, external. From outside of me. NOT my internal monologue. <br><br>I then asked &quot;Why all the bad in the world?&quot; <br><br>A response. <br><br>&quot;So humanity can learn from their mistakes.&quot;<br><br>Take that to mean what you will, but after that I was and am still sure that Jesus Christ is real. Like, really real. I&#039;m not here to get into an ontological argument with anyone or prove myself or anything, I&#039;ll be leaving this thread after this post. But my point is this: <br><br>Without an ABSOLUTELY open mind, true faith that something that you do not believe in MAY perhaps be real, you&#039;re approaching it in the wrong way. I had tried praying many times since I was a child, and it was only in my 20s that I truly found God. And it was good.<br><br>Side note about the voice: imagine Elohim from The Talos Principle (don&#039;t accuse me of transference, or do idc, but I hadn&#039;t played that game until after I had my religious experience. Basically kinda like that.) Loud, authoritative, not necessarily kind or unkind. Just... There.

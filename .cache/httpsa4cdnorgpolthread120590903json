This being by way of those in power in capitalism, the 1% if you will would choke and squeeze out any wealth from the workers to starvation and force a revolution.<br><br>But as we moved through the early 20th century the opposite happened in capitalist countries. Workers relative to history were getting richer and thus capitalist countries would never reach the predicted communist revolutionary conclusion that really formed a core basis of the ideology.<br><br>Around the 1920&#039;s is when anyone with a brain and shred of dignity would of jumped off the train. This is when communists\/marxist leaders either insane or afraid of losing power turned to subversion.<br><br>The victims they needed (the workers) were not going to come to fruition. So we see the beginning of what we see today with minorities and women adopting a self destructive victomhood culture. Marxists infiltrated every corner of the globe and especially in america they began pushing propaganda that the capitalist government was racist, misogynist, and against you. You being any minority group they could manipulate.<br><br>Through these subversion efforts they inadvertently bring Hitler to power. And by some stroke of stupid luck manage to turn what could of been there absolutely obliteration into a scapegoat to further their agenda.<br><br>It&#039;s at this point they so deeply entrench themselves into the education and political institutions with plenty of help from the unchallenged USSR that western governments are setup to bring up a youth through public schooling, universities, and total control of the media that is completely leftist\/Marxist indoctrinated. A failed ideology that clings on to it&#039;s power through subversion, and horrendous totalitarian states that murder over 100m people. All to keep the fantasy alive and their parasitic power in tact.<br><br>So why do we still allow them in our countries?","filename":"fsdd","ext":".png","w":1200,"h":1142,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":237,"tim":1491913209695,"time":1491913209,"md5":"kNtxIWUci4OK40h5XJFeTw==","fsize":50431,"resto":0,"id":"NZ7dB42s","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"communism-wrongly-predicted-capitalism-would-fail","country_name":"United States","replies":14,"images":2,"unique_ips":9},{"no":120591080,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)08:22:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"shut up nerd","filename":"Clipboard04","ext":".jpg","w":630,"h":423,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1491913327671,"time":1491913327,"md5":"GuWH74QMRQKr2SpHr+wuGA==","fsize":64002,"resto":120590903,"id":"RKrva6UB","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120591466,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)08:26:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120591080\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120591080<\/a><br>n*rd?","time":1491913572,"resto":120590903,"id":"NZ7dB42s","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120591584,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)08:27:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"Time hasn&#039;t ended.

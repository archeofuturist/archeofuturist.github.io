My book will be the foundation for a world revolution of the mind like no other. It must start here at pol because you people are the only ones who will understand it at first. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Groundbreaking core philosophy and understanding of human nature: The duality of human nature says that with free will and inherent powerlessness, we can act either destructively or in the way of building. It&#039;s about cultivating the right kind of balanced power and not being sucked into destructive mindsets, and organizing collectively to tackle society-wide problems that produce unnecessary powerlessness.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Groundbreaking understanding of the sexual nature of man and woman and how sexual choices play out into the creation of society, done in pol fashion but attacking it at a deeper philosophical level and doing it in all-encompassing fashion. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Groundbreaking understanding of economics. My background is in economics, and I have created a revolutionary economic system based around personal economic choice, respect for one another, and knowing what must be done.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Understanding the importance of aesthetics, &quot;frame&quot;, and how if people feed their minds with certain information, they will align themselves mentally with the frame or aesthetic of the creation. As you see this is important in shaping minds.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Many many other areas I go into that will really make you think, ending off in a call to explore the universe and colonize other worlds, for the sake of survival, inspiring wonder, and creating power.<\/span><br><br>The time to act is now, the destructiveness and ignorance outweighs those of us that build and is continuing to drive humanity into suffering. A revolution is needed.","filename":"earth and moon","ext":".jpg","w":984,"h":984,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492352273572,"time":1492352273,"md5":"vlR2UpJgVH3bs0ztXaDYLA==","fsize":203020,"resto":0,"id":"Nw59t6Ks","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-foundation-for-exploration","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":121362660,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)10:19:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;my book<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;black square<\/span><br>what do you want? money?","time":1492352364,"resto":121362522,"id":"A0Iv\/iRK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

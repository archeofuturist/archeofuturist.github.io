I can&#039;t stop it but I just want to be in control of the experience. I want to be the person to turn off the lights, and to be in charge of the last things I taste, hear, smell, and see. I&#039;m not depressed but I absolutely plan on suicide. <br>I want to die outside in the sunshine. I&#039;ll to feel the crisp forest air. I&#039;ll have a single rose in right hand and my father&#039;s arbalet in the left. I&#039;ll sing Desteapta-te Romane my mother used to sing to me and watch the sun rise one last time. I&#039;ll breath deep the sweet smell of the rose and mountain air and hold it in as long as I can. When I&#039;m ready to exhale I pull the trigger and return to the nothingness from which I came.","filename":"IMG_3011","ext":".jpg","w":529,"h":529,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491248371840,"time":1491248371,"md5":"BDbDxrWnyox0SqYUqvF8Aw==","fsize":86912,"resto":0,"id":"\/yDiq6Ke","country":"RO","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"who-is-planning-on-actually-ending-their-own","country_name":"Romania","replies":7,"images":0,"unique_ips":4},{"no":119370374,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)15:41:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"sounds pretty stupid desu. why put your family through this sort of thing? i mean i can understand you wanting to be the one to take yourself out, but why blow your head off? gotta be a cleaner\/more peaceful way. or you could just live your life out. you must be pretty unhappy if youre planning your own death already.","time":1491248499,"resto":119370096,"id":"xQ5+9XXP","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119370591,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)15:43:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119370374\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119370374<\/a><br>You don&#039;t understand","time":1491248618,"resto":119370096,"id":"\/yDiq6Ke","country":"RO","country_name":"Romania"},{"no":119370723,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)15:44:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119370096\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119370096<\/a><br>You need to realize that you&#039;re not in control of everything.

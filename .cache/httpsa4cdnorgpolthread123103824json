Kinship not being defined necessarily by ethnicity or region but by religion and religious proximity, meaning identification with your congregation and ones that seem similar. That sort of died off in the 60s and led to the rise of secular &quot;ethnic&quot; identity<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Europeans identify a lot more with regionalism and tend to conflate ethnicity with nationality. Part of what makes someone a Norwegian, for example, is their constant exposure to the social expectations of the society and their being shaped by their family, school, and the state.

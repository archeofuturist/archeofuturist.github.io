Schizophrenia usually has anxiety but anxiety doesn&#039;t cause it. And there is no reason to smoke weed if it makes you paranoid to &quot;feel normal&quot;. That is retarded and you shouldn&#039;t try to convince sick people not to seek help. I have seen schizophrenia ruin a persons life. Someone who would achieve a lot but would always stop taking his meds.","time":1490937403,"resto":119004504,"id":"It0ZvVCc","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119024112,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)01:18:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"Shit this thread&#039;s still going on?","time":1490937489,"resto":119004504,"id":"C\/b78qLs","country":"AR","country_name":"Argentina"},{"no":119024233,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)01:19:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119004504\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119004504<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;22<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;kissless virgin with no interest in either sex<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;no degree but have 10~ years of work experience, some random like martial arts instructor<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;shitty low pay job where all my colleagues are Mexicans<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;raised alone<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;living alone<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;will die alone and no one will remember me<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;no aspirations, no dreams<\/span><br>Sometimes I wonder if should just adopt an orphan so they won&#039;t grow up the same way.

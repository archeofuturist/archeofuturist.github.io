We aren&#039;t part of Schengen, and we don&#039;t have to adopt the Euro, as well as getting all of the benefits of being an EU member.<br><br>Second, because the EU aren&#039;t stupid any deal they offer will by definition be worse than what we already have.<br><br>Third, we have just handed over complete control of the negotiations to the EU. We have so little to offer that threatening to kick out EU nationals and leave without any deal (which would be a disaster for us) is all we can do. If you seriously think we have any chance of convincing the EU to give us a great deal, then I urge you to rethink.<br><br>Fourth, the referendum was advisory. I know it&#039;s a dead horse, but I&#039;m not going to stop beating this dead horse until people admit that by definition you can ignore a non-binding referendum. All the key Leave arguments (uncontrolled immigration, sovereignty, \u00a3350m for the NHS, Turkey joining the EU) have been exposed as lies. At this point the only thing they have is that they got more votes in the referendum. If the &quot;will of the people&quot; is so important, then lets make sure that leaving the EU is still the majority opinion. Lets have one last vote, legally binding, simple majority, in or out, so nobody can argue. Or are you afraid that a majority will vote to stay in the EU?<br><br>Finally, you may argue that it would set a bad precedent to ignore the referendum result. As mentioned before, all of the key arguments for leaving the EU are based on lies and misinformation. If Remain had lied on the scale the Leave campaign did and won by the same margin, then Theresa May decided that meant joining Schengen, adopting the Euro, pushing for Turkey to join the EU and spearheading the creation of an EU army, would Leave voters accept it?. No, they would be rioting in the streets.

At a much reduced competitiveness, and much higher cost, and with a massively reduced bargaining power, yes. In a number of years, we will probably be able to arrange some trade deals which are significantly worse that the ones we have now.

How on earth can you expect countries on the other side of the world to make up for restricted trading with Europe in our backyard?

If goods can be manufactured in China, where costs are considerably cheaper and shipped tariff free to the UK, then that is what will happen,destroying manufacturing in the UK. If the US service industry sees opportunities in the UK via an FTA, it will swallow up UK business in the blink of an eye.","filename":"methode%2Ftimes%2Fprod%2Fweb%2Fbin%2Fc2d94f34-1965-11e7-a725-c619aa6571c2","ext":".jpg","w":758,"h":505,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1491649325234,"time":1491649325,"md5":"DuDGdCKjwdM\/sAfg7tH7Mw==","fsize":84783,"resto":120113808,"id":"XLWy\/1ni","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120118859,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)07:04:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120118655\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120118655<\/a><br>If the UK is okay with him following his own party interests rather than the national interest in the country, fair enough.

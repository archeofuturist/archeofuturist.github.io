Still made some good movies. Brazil is pretty awesome anyway. There are plenty of filmmakers that even literally make shit up as they go along and it sometimes turns out OK. Herzog does that quite a bit, and he&#039;s pretty hit and miss because of it. Lynch usually does it, and appears to be an actual autist\/retard. Plenty of modern art is just nonsense. There must be a million examples of people just flinging shit at a canvas and seeing how it turns out. Some composers make music that is purely random. It is what it is. Gilliam isn&#039;t that bad really. At least most of his films have some sort of story.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Palin for best Python.<\/span><br>How come?","time":1491646321,"resto":120113808,"id":"OHnCCkAg","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"}]}

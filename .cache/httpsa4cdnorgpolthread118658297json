The words are extremely easy to read and easy to make if you know how past, present and future tenses work because words don&#039;t change like it does in english. You can very easily learn basic turkish but the problem is that you can add everything to the word. There are words that can go for two lines because you can say &quot;\/muvaffakiyet\/sizle\u015ftiricile\u015ftiriv<wbr>eremeyebileceklerimizdenmi\u015fsinizces<wbr>ine&quot; which means &quot;As though you are from those whom we may not be able to easily make into a maker of unsuccessful one&quot; , all those other than the word is between \/\/ is suffixes which can be repeated indefinitely.<br><br>But these words are only in literature and not used in real life at all. You can easily live in istanbul by learning hello, goodbye, and can i get this? (How much is this) because many people will understand from your body language.<br><br>Although the post is long, let me add, if you know turkish you can basically learn every fucking language known to man.

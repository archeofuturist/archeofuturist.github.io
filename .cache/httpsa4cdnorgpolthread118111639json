I used to love Radiolab a lot. Their show about Ravel&#039;s Bolero and its connections to a neuro-degenerative disease is one of my favourite shows of all time.<br><br>Lately they&#039;re pandering along political left lines so hard that it&#039;s becoming a joke. Their most recent show is about police shootings and how bad and racist they are, despite ALSO SAYING IN THE FIRST FIVE MINUTES that like 75% of them the aggressor was violent and had a.weapon. The rest of the episode goes into sob story territory.<br><br>Why is everything so biased and politically motivated? Why not inquire about why 75% of black shootings are violent,weapon-brandishing aggressors?<br><br>Unlawful shootings enrage me, but you can&#039;t ignore the fucking majority acceptable shootings!","filename":"Radiolab","ext":".png","w":600,"h":600,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490380620504,"time":1490380620,"md5":"YZ8KWt2w6B+PMBuLIuqmmA==","fsize":66658,"resto":0,"id":"1kCaK5XM","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"what-the-fuck-is-going-on","country_name":"Canada","replies":6,"images":0,"unique_ips":5},{"no":118111810,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)14:38:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"You know the answer to that anon.","time":1490380713,"resto":118111639,"id":"RfVQ6v1P","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118111992,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)14:40:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118111639\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118111639<\/a><br>Share these thought with your liberal friends.

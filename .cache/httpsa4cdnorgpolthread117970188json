The only men who get nothing are plebs who cannot provide any worth.","time":1490304130,"resto":117970188,"id":"XIz0UiR5","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117985617,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)17:23:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117970409\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117970409<\/a><br>Yes, because it will get you shanked in the middle of the street.","time":1490304190,"resto":117970188,"id":"CY0vZoxG","country":"IT","country_name":"Italy"},{"no":117985668,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)17:23:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117970188\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117970188<\/a><br>shit man i have a hard enough time dealing with one, you really want to be outnumbered?

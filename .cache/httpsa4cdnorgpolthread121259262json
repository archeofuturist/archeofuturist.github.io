Group biases. People follow the herd and conform to what everyone else says (social proof and conformity).<br>2. Cognitive dissonance and defense mechanisms. Trump supporters are on board because it&#039;s way, way too painful (depressing, embarassing, traumatic) to admit that maybe Trump strung them along and he&#039;s just the same as every other politician. &quot;Normies&quot; are on board because to be otherwise is to consider that the media and government will lie and manipulate about the worst things (e.g. False flags), which is very traumatic because it&#039;s like finding out daddy doesn&#039;t care about you and everything he&#039;s ever said is a lie. In which case, what IS real? 9\/11? Moon landing? Gravity? Realising the scale of deception is DEVASTATING. The brain does what it can to protect itself.","filename":"image","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":659,"tn_w":94,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492295699576,"time":1492295699,"md5":"YrBQ908RnBASoLCyWtVWZg==","fsize":81415,"resto":121259262,"id":"ExYAb9ue","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121272786,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)18:36:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121271730\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121271730<\/a><br>it sort of doesn&#039;t matter if it actually happened when everyone believes it did","time":1492295812,"resto":121259262,"id":"hT1Q7leZ","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":121273804,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)18:44:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121259262\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121259262<\/a><br>This guy has a twitter it&#039;s a goldmine of phony fraud shit.","filename":"twitter","ext":".png","w":655,"h":571,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":108,"tim":1492296278367,"time":1492296278,"md5":"zqeyE7rfJoDj3AQjWqZvZA==","fsize":339144,"resto":121259262,"id":"DHoXl56C","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121273950,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)18:45:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121259405\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121259405<\/a><br><br>Putin is a Manlet...","time":1492296343,"resto":121259262,"id":"7krw2vi\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121274198,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)18:47:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121259262\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121259262<\/a><br>It was the table pounding on the world&#039;s conference room.

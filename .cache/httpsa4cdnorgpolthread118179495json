Frogs in the bible represent evil spirits","com":"The area which I saw represented the United States of America. The frogs represent evil spirits and sin. Frogs in the bible represent evil spirits, as well as being part of a plague. They are all lined up in the dream as they are in America, all across the nation, but particularly in an oval shape. This represents the oval office of the white house. These frogs or evil spirits are attempting to control us, and to even enter some through possession. They have plagued our nation and plan to destroy it. The frog that I was attempting to destroy was increasing in size, just as the sin and evil spirits in America are doing now.","filename":"la-1476192068-snap-photo","ext":".jpg","w":400,"h":225,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1490412574842,"time":1490412574,"md5":"NQyjTpq2yKrvdhKN0wXFCQ==","fsize":12514,"resto":0,"id":"Sjmr18WO","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-frogs-represent-evil-spirits-and-sin-frogs-in","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

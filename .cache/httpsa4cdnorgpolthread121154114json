Would you eat synthetic meat if it were price-competitive or cheaper than normally produced meat if the taste was indistinguishable, \/pol\/, and should we be investing more into technologies like this that could drastically cut back on our energy consumption and help the environment?","filename":"SyntheticMeat1","ext":".jpg","w":624,"h":355,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":142,"tim":1492222916792,"time":1492222916,"md5":"JNOlAbZ5gxHspwK05UXIrQ==","fsize":19904,"resto":0,"id":"mlIbli20","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"lab-grown-meat","country_name":"United States","replies":4,"images":0,"unique_ips":5},{"no":121154443,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)22:24:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121154114\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121154114<\/a><br>This is probably the future.

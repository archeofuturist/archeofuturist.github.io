America&#039;s gun control laws that do exist are aimed at stopping niggers from getting high quality guns like Sawed off shotguns and automatic rifles. They&#039;re too poor to pay for both the gun and the $200 tax stamps let alone pass background checks. They&#039;ll also probably be dead by the time the process goes through.","filename":"NFA","ext":".jpg","w":439,"h":605,"tn_w":90,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491677383683,"time":1491677383,"md5":"iFAeXfO6onYAtb2W65QLoQ==","fsize":128146,"resto":120160195,"id":"Z\/HYTqb5","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120166176,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)14:49:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120160557\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120160557<\/a><br>That doesn&#039;t really matter because things will never escalate to military intervention anyway","time":1491677393,"resto":120160195,"id":"MHZV3jN4","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120166321,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)14:51:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120161405\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120161405<\/a><br>Psssst... that&#039;s the joke","time":1491677476,"resto":120160195,"id":"yIf1QwD5","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120166360,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)14:51:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120166095\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120166095<\/a><br>Better safe than sorry.","time":1491677495,"resto":120160195,"id":"kHKn\/jw1","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120166361,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)14:51:35","name":"Anonymous","filename":"1465079522449","ext":".jpg","w":835,"h":776,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":116,"tim":1491677495915,"time":1491677495,"md5":"8QZEMg8MkWdozEBUP\/B85Q==","fsize":151067,"resto":120160195,"id":"exIDw4tn","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120166428,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)14:52:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120164623\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120164623<\/a><br>This is another good point, in the event of a civil war, who the fuck will be paying taxes? <br><br>I suspect that once the financial system collapses(this is how the government will try to shut it down), most cities will go into a panic and cannibalize themselves.

Shellshocked. They put him there and went to do something else why some faggot took a photo for propaganda. There is nothing shady in the scene at all.

I dont see why its a problem to give a different context to the picture. The reason \/pol\/ flips out over these pictures is because western media propagandizes them and creates a completely false narrative to drive their agenda. Whens the last time a picture of victims fron rebel atrocities (much worse than regime) made international headlines? It doesnt happen. The media acts like literally only one side is causing harm. War is hell and thats never going to change. Only reporting on dying kids is just bad, dishonest journalism. Everyone knows that kids are going to die in a war zone. Thats the world we live in. Blowing it up into a massive &quot;scandal&quot; is just retarded and such a disgustingly low way to push an agenda. Why doesnt the media just actually report on the war? Why is reading one \/sg\/ thread more informative than 6 years of msm reporting?","time":1491433161,"resto":119667999,"id":"9nFzgM2q","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119670242,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)19:04:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;shills stepping up their emotional manipulation game <\/span><br>They can go to Saudi-Arabia or Israel.

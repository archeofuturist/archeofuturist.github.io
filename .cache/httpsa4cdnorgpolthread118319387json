Mine:<br><br>Make health insurance like car insurance. If you can&#039;t prove your a healthy, exercising, non-fat, non-smoking person you don&#039;t get cheap coverage. You get fucking expensive coverage. We don&#039;t sell cheap car insurance to people with 6 DUIs, so we shouldn&#039;t give overweight people and super old people super nice health coverage for dirt cheap.<br><br>Also, health insurance should no longer be used for &quot;day to day&quot; health issues. Get a cold? Tough it out, don&#039;t go to the doctor for the sniffles. Pneumonia, yes. Bronchitis\/common cold, no.<br><br>Obviously also get rid of the artificial state insurance lines as Trump has suggested.<br><br>Finally, establish a National Health R&amp;D fund that will help keep drug company R&amp;D costs down and therefore control drug prices.","filename":"o-BEST-HEALTHCARE-facebook","ext":".jpg","w":1536,"h":1025,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1490502532210,"time":1490502532,"md5":"NvlckPevUl5iPIw8fZORhg==","fsize":287864,"resto":0,"id":"2kDp1ND0","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"whats-your-personal-idea-for-a-health-insurance","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

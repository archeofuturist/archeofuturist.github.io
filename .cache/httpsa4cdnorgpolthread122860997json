There are tasks, duties and behavioral norms placed on both men and women and these tasks, duties and norms are different for the respective sexes. This is what it means to assume a gender role: to either assume the tasks, duties and norms of the one sex, or those of the other. How these roles developed is up to debate. It may be that bits of a role are embedded into biology, it may be that a role is constructed entirely by society. However, if one looks to the turn for gender equality Western society took, one must realize that at least part of the role is constructed by society. Otherwise, such a turn in gender roles wouldn&#039;t have been possible. Yet it&#039;s at the same time hard to stand up for a view that supposes the entirety of a gender role is consucted by society. If one assumes this, then one must find a starting point from which gender roles developed other than biology. One may turn to economics, the physical features of man and woman or even coincidence to resolve this conflict. <br><br>I won&#039;t even attempt to find a solution to the problem here.<br><br>The point is that people should realize that this issue is more complex than popular opinion - in either of the camps - has made it seem.","time":1493201180,"resto":122860997,"id":"ama+ZKLz","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":122867846,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)06:09:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122866204\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122866204<\/a><br>It&#039;s just definition-creep on the term gender.

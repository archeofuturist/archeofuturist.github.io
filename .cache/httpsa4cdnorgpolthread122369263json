Customize several Gulfstream business jets with military engines and with equipment to produce and disperse fine droplets of sulfuric acid. Fly the jets up around 20 kilometers\u2014significantly higher than the cruising altitude for a commercial jetliner but still well within their range. At that altitude in the tropics, the aircraft are in the lower stratosphere. The planes spray the sulfuric acid, carefully controlling the rate of its release. The sulfur combines with water vapor to form sulfate aerosols, fine particles less than a micrometer in diameter. These get swept upward by natural wind patterns and are dispersed over the globe, including the poles. Once spread across the stratosphere, the aerosols will reflect about 1 percent of the sunlight hitting Earth back into space. Increasing what scientists call the planet\u2019s albedo, or reflective power, will partially offset the warming effects caused by rising levels of greenhouse gases.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;http:\/\/archive.is\/FfRog<\/span><br>MIT Technology Review","time":1492917511,"resto":122369263,"id":"P13map5G","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122372222,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)23:24:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"The NY TIMES normalizing it already<br>April 18,2017<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;http:\/\/archive.is\/9NLMJ<\/span><br>Suppose Keith\u2019s research shows that solar geoengineering works.

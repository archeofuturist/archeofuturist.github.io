You did this shit to me!! I didn&#039;t want to be a conservative, I would have been fine going around blind to liberal brainwashing and double standards. IM A FUCKING HISPANIC MALE FOR FUCKS SAKE. I was a full libtard and also a proud \/b\/tard. Then I visited this place. Then I stuck around, and Now I&#039;m FUCKED. I constantly watch Fox News and pay attention to every White House related meeting and briefing. I didn&#039;t even do that for Obama. All my liberal friends who I&#039;ve known since middle school (I&#039;m 21 now) look at me strange and make fun of me when I express my views. No matter what I say I&#039;m a &quot;self hating insecure ignorant Hispanic&quot; or I&#039;m a &quot;nazi&quot; because I don&#039;t believe double standards against white people is true equality. I hate them for accepting the media and liberal brainwashing but I hate YOU FUCKS even more now. You&#039;ve ruined my life, at first i tried to laugh it off, I thought it was a faze and that I was still &quot;liberal&quot;. But I can&#039;t turn a blind eye to their constant degeneracy and manipulation of our younger gens. I meanlook at this springbreak BULLSHIT!!! How is it cool to get so drunk you can&#039;t even control your body?? Why is risking rape or murder the new social &quot;standard&quot;? Or how about the Jewish stranglehold on our own government and their false narratives to push society into a 24\/7 larp fest with no genders or race or status quo? I&#039;m now scared for the future, for my future sons who will most likely end up being &quot;progressive&quot; cock gobblers if they attend public schools (which is all I can afford) because it&#039;s somehow fucking hersey to say that boys should not be sexual with other boys. I&#039;m scared shitless that the world will never wake up because they see every conservative views as the new fascism when it&#039;s just basic decency. How did you guys cope? What was it like for you when you first OD&#039;d on redpills? I new help guys, it&#039;s all so depressing.","time":1490790844,"resto":118780762,"id":"+x2GRXKK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118781228,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)08:35:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118780895\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118780895<\/a><br>always archive. pass it on<br>http:\/\/archive.is\/QttG8","time":1490790900,"resto":118780762,"id":"ndYY69Cm","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118781259,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)08:35:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118781067\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118781067<\/a><br>our little slaves are getting desperate","filename":"1487217952836","ext":".png","w":409,"h":443,"tn_w":115,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490790919745,"time":1490790919,"md5":"Xme780ZyLqqHcBftc\/CBZQ==","fsize":322910,"resto":118780762,"id":"zJvDOj7S","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":118781281,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)08:35:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118780895\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118780895<\/a><br><br>OUT OUT OUT OUT","filename":"IMG_0888","ext":".jpg","w":765,"h":640,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":104,"tim":1490790932146,"time":1490790932,"md5":"EKRoqXkEVFxqAzGMG3eNCQ==","fsize":67989,"resto":118780762,"id":"gVcNVPtb","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118781290,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)08:35:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/arti<wbr>cles\/2017-03-29\/soros-s-university-<wbr>caught-in-orban-campaign-as-ceu-pro<wbr>tests-law<br><br>OH NO, THAT SUCKS","filename":"Capture","ext":".png","w":1105,"h":265,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":29,"tim":1490790939069,"time":1490790939,"md5":"Bhqnw3CW\/DKHiLLlKDgWEQ==","fsize":35194,"resto":118780762,"id":"vuwz6ldm","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118781350,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)08:36:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118781155\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118781155<\/a><br>If you want to go back.

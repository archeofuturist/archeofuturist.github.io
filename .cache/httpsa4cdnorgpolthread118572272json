However, these salaries are just laughable. For example, if I don&#039;t have a flat in Moscow I&#039;ll have to pay at least 30k roubles\/month to rent a pretty shitty flat, whereas the salary of an inexperienced worker (e.g. of students like me) is around 30k (Moscow). There is also a big censorship on mass media. They didn&#039;t show anything about the protests on major news channels that 90% of people watches because those news channels are influenced by the government.<br>The pensioners&#039; pensions are very small and they sometimes can&#039;t make a monthly payment for their own apartment. <br>Now about 26 March&#039;s events, the police arrested almost everyone with placards no matter what was written on them and tended to arrest people randomly, they just arrested people that didn&#039;t try to interfere the police&#039;s work.

If tax rates will go up again and if Putin or Medvedev are to sit in the president&#039;s seat again, the people will riot. However, I can&#039;t say for sure if those riots will lead to something big or not because as I said, Russian people can&#039;t riot(the aftermath of communism?) like guys from Western countries, but the people&#039;s patience is ending because when you rise even 10k people in Russia to protest against the government it&#039;s a pretty big deal here lol","time":1490659421,"resto":118572272,"id":"OxiQSj1T","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":118583269,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)20:07:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118582477\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118582477<\/a><br><br>Hy \u0445o\u0442\u044c \u043fo\u0447\u0438c\u0442\u0438\u0442 \u043aa\u043a ca\u043c\u0438\u0445 c\u0438\u043bo\u0432\u0438\u043ao\u0432 \u0438 \u0442a\u043c \u0447e\u0447e\u043do\u0432 a\u0432oc\u044c e\u0431\u043de\u0442, \u043fo \u043co\u0438\u043c \u0434a\u043d\u043d\u044b\u043c \u044d\u0442\u0438\u0445 \u043de\u043da\u0432\u0438\u0434\u044f\u0442 \u043aa\u043a \u0432 \u0424C\u0411, \u0442a\u043a \u0438 \u0432 ap\u043c\u0438\u0438.","time":1490659669,"resto":118572272,"id":"S50eKjvm","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"}]}

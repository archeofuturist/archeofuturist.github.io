They held on exclusively to power for decades and took all the jobs, all the money was in their hands and they all had private armies while other sects were starved and helpless.When their bloc lost a parliamentary election in 1958, they called in American Marines to invade Beirut and reinstall them in power. If they had dealt fairly with the majority (not just the Muslims, but the Druze as well as other Christian sects) they could have stayed in power. Instead, the Phalangists used the Palestinians presence (btw which was initially militarily and politically opposed by virtually ALL Lebanese sects, including the Shiites and most Sunnis) as a pretext to start slaughtering their political opponents (including other Christians, go read what the Phalangists did to the Franjieh and Chamoun clans) and slaughtering MUSLIMS AND CHRISTIANS WHO WERE ACTIVELY FIGHTING AGAINST ARAFAT because of their religion or because they were in a different Christian party. To top it all off, Syrians entered Lebanon at the invitation of the Phalangists, and the Phalangists tooks Israels side against their own people later on all the way until 2000, then were left off the hook and not punished post-Israeli withdrawal. I know \/pol\/ likes to live in the clouds where are all Christians are saints, but in Lebanon, the phalangists got whats coming to them. Now, theyre like helpless dogs begging hezbollah to protect them from ISIS. Theyre lucky the shiites didnt genocide them and continue to allow them to exist and live their pathetic lives in lebanon","time":1493491268,"resto":123361447,"id":"MEby8OSt","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123364315,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)14:43:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123361447\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123361447<\/a><br><br>Neck yourself you Zionist puppet.","filename":"Gaddafi","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":576,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1493491402224,"time":1493491402,"md5":"\/6FD72c0Ds65MBgg5\/2\/+A==","fsize":79826,"resto":123361447,"id":"9scQKJPS","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123364415,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)14:44:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"Is that bachir gemayel?

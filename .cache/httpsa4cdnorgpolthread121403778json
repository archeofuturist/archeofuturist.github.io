This causes men and women to shed the discipline that they developed to create civilization in favor of low order desires. It makes men weak and its women traitorous. When such a society is that dysfunctional and degenerate, it leaves it vulnerable for any organized group to dominate through their own disciplined will and fervor. In modern western society this is the invasion of Islam, welcomed by atheists and leftists alike.

Since the big bang theory is nearly accepted as fact, it stands to reason perfectly well that there were a &quot;big banger&quot;, which would be &quot;god&quot;. This is given credence by the theory that, before the big bang, the current laws of physics did not exist, because, if they did, there&#039;s no way that infinitely dense mass that was the universe could exist, and, if it did, no real way it could have exploded, as the gravity would just cause it to collapse back on itself, like an infinitely imploding black hole. Since they didnt exist before the black hole, scientists have postulated that the 4 fundamental force&#039;s( gravity, electromagnetic, strong nuke and weak nuke) values and ratios in relation to each other were determined within millionths of a millisecond after the &quot;bang&quot; took place. If these number were off by one septillionth, the universe as we know it could not exist, and wouldnt have existed. But it did. This points to divine creation.<br><br>In the 20th century, Sagan said that the necessary components for life were water and a favorable distance from the sun. They then began searching for intelligent life on other planets. They then realized that there were a great deal more factors necessary for life. The list of possible planets that could sustain life shrank and shrank from millions to just a couple hundred, and, as NASA scientists have said, the silence from the universe is deafening. Nothing we could interpret in any way could be deemed a form of intelligent communication. Now, the evidence of absence isn&#039;t the absence of evidence, but, as our methods of searching for life become increasingly more advanced, the odds that there is other life out there goes down, and thus, that the odds that life on our planet is just a &quot;random consequence&quot; goes up.","time":1492389708,"resto":121403778,"id":"HywORStY","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121449499,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)20:41:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121416220\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121416220<\/a><br>Would you say that you have...faith?","time":1492389710,"resto":121403778,"id":"FZQ4iOuC","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121449659,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)20:42:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121449489\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121449489<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Most scientists have begun to move towards this notion that there is some creator god of some form<\/span><br>[citation needed]","time":1492389766,"resto":121403778,"id":"cS2RpnBb","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":121450503,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)20:48:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121403778\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121403778<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;edgy atheist cringelord<\/span>","filename":"057","ext":".jpg","w":800,"h":800,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492390083562,"time":1492390083,"md5":"wF5q6cdbrmX3LJH1XCfiIQ==","fsize":83717,"resto":121403778,"id":"Rs0pMhk3","country":"CL","country_name":"Chile"},{"no":121450531,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)20:48:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121449340\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121449340<\/a><br>I can&#039;t prove Thor, Zeus and Horus don&#039;t exist, but I also don&#039;t go around preaching to people that they don&#039;t.

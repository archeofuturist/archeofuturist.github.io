Atheism is in decline worldwide, with the number of atheists falling from 4.5% of the world&#039;s population in 1970 to 2.0% in 2010 and projected to drop to 1.8% by 2020, <br><br>Real surveys and statistics say atheism is on the decline worldwide. Sorry atheists but atheism is not on the rise nor is it winning. It&#039;s still the minority and a declining one at that. <br><br>The Pew Research Center&#039;s statistics show that atheism is expected to continue to decline all the way into 2050 with a continued growth of religion. Other research also shows a huge surge in growth for Christianity in China which is currently the world&#039;s most &quot;atheist&quot; nation because of the atheist communist government suppressing religion, the research suggests that China will soon become the world&#039;s most Christian nation within 15 years. <br><br>This is simply history repeating itself: Christianity prospered in Rome back in the ancient era when it was suppressed and it still grew in the militant atheist soviet Russia when it was suppressed there only a century ago with the majority of Russians today now also identifying as Christian. Just goes to show that atheist suppression of religion still doesn&#039;t stop religion.<br><br>Sources for the legion of whiny \/Redditor\/ fedoras that will no doubt show up it this thread:<br><br>http:\/\/www.pewforum.org\/2015\/04\/02\/<wbr>religious-projections-2010-2050\/<br>http:\/\/www.pewforum.org\/2012\/12\/18\/<wbr>global-religious-landscape-unaffili<wbr>ated\/<br>http:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/news\/wor<wbr>ldnews\/asia\/china\/10776023\/China-on<wbr>-course-to-become-worlds-most-Chris<wbr>tian-nation-within-15-years.html<br>http:\/\/masterrussian.com\/russia\/fac<wbr>ts.htm","filename":"1490142549767","ext":".jpg","w":608,"h":755,"tn_w":201,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491752108096,"time":1491752108,"md5":"gbLQR\/M\/TdWWLU+dYjIA+Q==","fsize":123410,"resto":0,"id":"uO0N+ysf","country":"PL","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"atheism-is-the-fastest-shrinking-religion-in-the","country_name":"Poland","replies":26,"images":14,"unique_ips":14},{"no":120294766,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)11:38:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120294419\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120294419<\/a><br>Nice photoshop you faggot.<br>https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/news<wbr>\/acts-of-faith\/wp\/2016\/04\/21\/my-wif<wbr>e-and-i-are-white-evangelicals-here<wbr>s-why-we-chose-to-give-birth-to-bla<wbr>ck-triplets\/?utm_term=.199c0fdd0d09<wbr>","time":1491752284,"resto":120294419,"id":"Mhjc1oUZ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120295337,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)11:42:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"A good point to make too. Atheists have a whole bunch of frivolous sex. With the likes of birth control and plan B stopping them from having kids. As well as the fact that in the west it is JAMMED down our throat to never get near a kid, they simply don&#039;t breed. So I can see that definitely. Albeit here in the west the lack of religious affiliation among the youth is growing rapidly.

This distortion in the sense of identity is a problem for communities because communities need to be well bonded to achieve the most efficient immune system and mental health in humans. We&#039;re tribe animals and we really need these bonds. Youll notice how in prosperous developed countries such as norway where there is rampant hedonism, alot of fucking and no love, people are actually miserable. Even though Im an athiest myself this certainly brings me to respect the power religion has to fill this need in our nature.

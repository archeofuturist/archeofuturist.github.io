The ideal situation is that they first go into debt to purchase your product, offering some kind of property as collateral such as the family farm\/house\/wahtever, and then when they fail to pay back the monopoly money you loaned them to buy your product, you take their property as payment on the debt. Now you have real property, which is worth way more than your shitty baby formula or gmo seeds.<br><br>But even if they dont end up losing everything, as debters they are easier to control. Someone who is in debt has their resources and attention restricted. They can&#039;t form violent revolutionary mobs or lobby governments for legal changes. Someone in debt can be coerced to agree to things they normally wouldn&#039;t by offering payment reductions or debt forgiveness. Debt creates a huge amount of leverage, which can be used for whatever reason you want. Whether it be to make laws better for your company so you can get 5% more profits on the next quarterly report... or to out right enslave a population in some insane quest for world domination. <br><br>Nestel&#039;s goal was most likely profits, but monsanto&#039;s goal was the land itself. They sought to drive local farmers out of business by first forcing them into debt, then buying up the land cheaply when they failed to meet payments. Monsanto wants a monopoly on food production, and to achieve that they need to have all the farmable land. It&#039;s a pretty simple and straight forward business model.

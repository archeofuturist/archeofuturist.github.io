McMaster was given responsibility for setting the agenda for meetings of the NSC or the Homeland Security Council, and was authorized to delegate that authority to Bossert, at his discretion, according to White House documents.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Under the move, the national intelligence director, Dan Coats, and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Marine Corps General Joseph Dunford, are again \u201cregular attendees\u201d of the NSC\u2019s principals committee.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Bannon, the former executive chairman of Breitbart News and Trump\u2019s alt-right guru, was elevated to the National Security Council\u2019s principals committee at the beginning of Trump\u2019s presidency.<\/span><br>The move drew criticism from some members of Congress and Washington\u2019s foreign policy establishment.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The move comes as new polling showing that Bannon is even less popular than Trump, who is viewed unfavorably by more Americans than any other president at this point in his term.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The Quinnipiac poll showed that just 11 percent of those surveyed having a favorable opinion and 45 percent having an unfavorable one \u2014 a 4-to-1 negative.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Bannon is a self-styled nationalist who was the one of the brains behind Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d policy.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;But his pugnacious style irritated many in Congress as well as his own colleagues in the administration.<\/span><br><br>HAHAHAHAHAHAHAH<br><br>What did they mean by

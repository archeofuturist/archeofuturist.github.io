There is no such thing as mind-independent, objective emergent properties, in the same way there is no such thing as mind-independent, objective information. Only the mind gives these things meaning. The mind exists; this is self-evident. Thus the mind isn&#039;t an emergent property. Thus the mind can&#039;t be produced by matter. Thus the mind is immaterial.

We have not produced AI yet, but only because we don&#039;t make computers that function like the human brain yet. Under no circumstances is the mind some spiritual thing. Our thoughts and actions are insanely dependent upon the chemicals in our brains, and when the mind dies, the person dies. You see this all the time in alzheimer&#039;s patients and stroke victims. We are the sum of our experiences because our brains record billions of cliff&#039;s notes for us to reflect upon in an instant when the memory is triggered. Memories assist in deducing meaning in a great many things, increasingly so as our experiences increase. If that portion of the brain is gone, you no longer have that memory. When enough of these are damaged, you no longer have the basis for a personality. You are your brain, and as much as you want to romanticize the fact that we haven&#039;t created AI, it&#039;s not because consciousness is attributed to a fairy tale.

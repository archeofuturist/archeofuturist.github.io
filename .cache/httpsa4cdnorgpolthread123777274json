You need to click on the button that shows the value in bitcoins, where it will reflect the increase in value. However note that you only realize this profit if you spend them as bitcoins. If you convert them back to dollars you get the original value minus any processing fees. Also, you are liable for taxes on the bitcoin appreciation even if you don&#039;t receive it, due to new regulations regarding cryptocurrencies signed by Trump a month or so ago, to close the loophole that allowed us to reap huge profits last year.","time":1493738947,"resto":123777274,"id":"qE12SJVW","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

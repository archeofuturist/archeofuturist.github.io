However, the next day my professor for News Writing 101 said in a private meeting with the department heads a different story. Evidently, while editorial staff of the paper is making a sincere effort towards objective reporting, the writers, particularly the younger ones who got into the business with justice on the brain, need to be kept on a short leash.

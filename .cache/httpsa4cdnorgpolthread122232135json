I don&#039;t know how widespread this one franchise is, but I particularly like this restaurant called BJ&#039;s (not to be confused with the wholesale grocery store). They&#039;re not only great place to get a burger, but also they have their own craft beers to go with. They have other stuff on the menu, but the burgers are the best thing on the menu. The burgers are quite creative and taste good.","filename":"1418731581967","ext":".jpg","w":785,"h":587,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1492843502713,"time":1492843502,"md5":"P4vkuFWi00zkVs+3F\/g3QA==","fsize":88096,"resto":122232135,"id":"ThIZdlCO","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122247592,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)02:45:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122247080\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122247080<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;(((civic nationalist)))<\/span><br>She won&#039;t even abolish dual citizenship.

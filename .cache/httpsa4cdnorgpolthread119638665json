It involves a deep commitment which some do not wish to make. Moreover, traditionally speaking, every great religion had both an exoteric and an esoteric dimension. In modern times the esoteric dimension has been lost or gone underground, become inaccessible. This has lead many spiritually-minded people to become disillusioned by religion, seeing in it only the exoteric forms, without the esoteric heart which once existed.","time":1491419893,"resto":119638665,"id":"azzfk0q8","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119642999,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)15:18:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119642646\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119642646<\/a><br>close to where i am at but i am of the belief that science and nature are part of &quot;it.&quot;","time":1491419919,"resto":119638665,"id":"DVHNp2S1","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119643236,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)15:20:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119642694\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119642694<\/a><br>That explains what happened to Joseph&#039;s wife Mary.<br><br>Who can resist the Cosmic Chad?","time":1491420030,"resto":119638665,"id":"uHo3s\/nT","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119643303,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)15:21:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119638665\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119638665<\/a><br>Coming to understand that religion is a method of right-brain imbalance mind control, and that you can still come to know the creator&#039;s natural law&#039;s of morality without having the intermediary of a priest class.","time":1491420062,"resto":119638665,"id":"fWJVRVIS","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119643636,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)15:23:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119638665\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119638665<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;im not religious im spiritual<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;what the heck does that even mean ?<\/span><br><br>It&#039;s when you want to be closer to god and live a godly life, but it&#039;s completely obvious to you that ALL organized religions are self serving shits run by satan.","filename":"spurdo_panda","ext":".png","w":377,"h":405,"tn_w":116,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491420226294,"time":1491420226,"md5":"R3ANcNNc\/0jlxs49nsjdCw==","fsize":17645,"resto":119638665,"id":"1x+V4Qsm","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119643944,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)15:26:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119642646\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119642646<\/a><br>It makes a lot of sense though.

Once you&#039;re a higher self, you get to choose your own reality and become your own law. At that point, anything can happen.&quot;<br><br>A century ago, the Western world was ruled by non - denominational but implicitly Christian governments, obedient to a moral law they themselves did not create, says Mr. Galloway. But as the Western elite began to buy into the notion of human evolution (under the tutelage of educational theorist John Dewey and numerous others), their politics became secular - humanist and materialist, and the meaning of life, family and right all came up for grabs.<br><br>But psychology couldn&#039;t stay materialistic, because people became disenchanted with thinking they were just cogs in the mechanical evolutionary gears,&quot; says Mr. Galloway. So educational theory turned to &quot;progressive&quot; spiritualism. &quot;Mystics like [deep - occultist] Carl Jung are standard fare in education departments now, and teachers&#039; conferences talk openly about being midwives of the spirit of Mother Earth.&quot; There&#039;s no saying what they will deliver. &quot;We&#039;re unleashing forces we can&#039;t control,&quot; he warns. &quot;And it&#039;s just started.&quot;","time":1491421754,"resto":119638665,"id":"uxFbdeVa","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119646930,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)15:50:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119645960\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119645960<\/a><br>you don&#039;t even know what it is your worship, you are so dumb you have to get what you know about the divine from a kike book instead of personal experience and journeys into the spiritual. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Christians totally hate jews goy, why wouldn&#039;t you follow them. <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;destroy naturalistic sacred grounds and build churches on top of them we&#039;re so great <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;nothing is real but Christianity <\/span><br><br>Lmao, alright bud, organized religion serves the same purpose as television.

Spiritual is their own interpretation.<br><br>Long answer, people believe in a force, God, or even something like themselves or more that doesn&#039;t fit one structure of religion. For example, I have roots in Christianity, but I don&#039;t think God is some old guy in the clouds. I think God is the embodiment of everything and we&#039;re all conscious fragments sharing a unique physical perspective of it, like little reporters to go tell infinity what it&#039;s like to be us (all people, animals, etc beyond just here). What else are you going to do being omnipotent? Float and do nothing? Think of a cup with a lot of holes poked in it and a light under, that&#039;s a good analogy. All unique but from the same source. It&#039;s why you really shouldn&#039;t worry about death.<br><br>Then you get into why i got in this with paranormal encounters, astral projecting, etc but too much to go over. That and why aliens are always seen in ships but they never do anything like steal resources or kill us all (when we were dumb cavemen) nor help us advance. Goes into Gnosticism that they may be Demons (achrons) just feeding off our pain and suffering, so why do anything to us? They make deals with our politicians for power and the people in charge fuck everything up to keep the chaos going when the right choice is right in front of them. <br><br>But yeah, kind of complicated.","filename":"wizalch","ext":".jpg","w":1440,"h":900,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":78,"tim":1491425399124,"time":1491425399,"md5":"RNsORKkZnu2QZcBHzh\/ZHA==","fsize":324412,"resto":119638665,"id":"oaBMfqfJ","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":119654703,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)16:54:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119642417\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119642417<\/a><br>All of them, numbskull","time":1491425652,"resto":119638665,"id":"Vw+2gG9O","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119654920,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)16:56:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119638665\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119638665<\/a><br>I believe in the natural philospohies and sciences but i do not believe in the social dogma that comes with religions.

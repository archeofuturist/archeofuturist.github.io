It involves a deep commitment which some do not wish to make. Moreover, traditionally speaking, every great religion had both an exoteric and an esoteric dimension. In modern times the esoteric dimension has been lost or gone underground, become inaccessible. This has lead many spiritually-minded people to become disillusioned by religion, seeing in it only the exoteric forms, without the esoteric heart which once existed.","time":1491419893,"resto":119638665,"id":"azzfk0q8","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119642999,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)15:18:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119642646\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119642646<\/a><br>close to where i am at but i am of the belief that science and nature are part of &quot;it.&quot;","time":1491419919,"resto":119638665,"id":"DVHNp2S1","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119643236,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)15:20:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119642694\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119642694<\/a><br>That explains what happened to Joseph&#039;s wife Mary.<br><br>Who can resist the Cosmic Chad?","time":1491420030,"resto":119638665,"id":"uHo3s\/nT","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119643303,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)15:21:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119638665\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119638665<\/a><br>Coming to understand that religion is a method of right-brain imbalance mind control, and that you can still come to know the creator&#039;s natural law&#039;s of morality without having the intermediary of a priest class.","time":1491420062,"resto":119638665,"id":"fWJVRVIS","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119643636,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)15:23:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119638665\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119638665<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;im not religious im spiritual<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;what the heck does that even mean ?<\/span><br><br>It&#039;s when you want to be closer to god and live a godly life, but it&#039;s completely obvious to you that ALL organized religions are self serving shits run by satan.","filename":"spurdo_panda","ext":".png","w":377,"h":405,"tn_w":116,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491420226294,"time":1491420226,"md5":"R3ANcNNc\/0jlxs49nsjdCw==","fsize":17645,"resto":119638665,"id":"1x+V4Qsm","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119643944,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)15:26:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119642646\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119642646<\/a><br>It makes a lot of sense though. You know that the perfect balance in our world cannot be a succession of coincidences and luck. All civilizations tried to explain our world with different religions involving god(s). Faith and spirituality is a necessary element to keep the human mind healthy. Faith moves mountains, it also give us balance and stability. The problem is that there is thousands of religions out there. Despite reading a lot of different religious books, it always feels like the answers to your questions are uncomplete or not fulfilled. You don&#039;t know which one to trust, and you end up to this position.

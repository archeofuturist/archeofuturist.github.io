Please help!<br><br>I&#039;ve been watching your actions on going after the Antifa scum with much amusement. Any chance those who are not running down those scumbags might have some time to pay attention to the antics of the corrupt mayor and city government in New Orleans? Mitch Landrieu has decided that he, against the wishes of the people of New Orleans, is going to destroy the monuments to Confederate generals Robert E. Lee, PGT Beauregard, and former president of the Confederacy, Jefferson Davis. He&#039;s also implied he&#039;s interested in destroying the centerpiece of New Orleans, the statue of President Andrew Jackson, who saved the city from the British, in 1815. The Confederate Generals and President were all pardoned and had their citizenships restored by act of Congress. Additionally, these monuments are protected by numerous Federal laws pertaining to monuments to US veterans, which all Confederate soldiers are considered.<br><br>Please, \/pol\/, someone help bring this bald-headed fool down, and stop him from destroying the history and monuments of New Orleans.","filename":"20151105_2026","ext":".jpg","w":552,"h":386,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":174,"tim":1493852274700,"time":1493852274,"md5":"greuDxqHV5g+2JTzOEdvDw==","fsize":40923,"resto":0,"id":"nhRFVQHB","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"lets-try-again","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":123979648,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)18:58:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"NYPA","time":1493852313,"resto":123979571,"id":"uKkAUBBr","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123979654,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)18:58:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123979571\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123979571<\/a><br>The fuck?

The waking &#039;reality&#039; and the dreaming &#039;reality&#039; that we experience are both experienced via electrical signals being interpreted by our brains. The simulation theory is a blue pill. The red pill is that &#039;reality&#039; is LIKE a simulation - that it&#039;s not &#039;reality&#039; that&#039;s like a computer, but that a computer is like &#039;reality&#039;. Technology mirrors &#039;reality&#039; and technology imitates biology (and this is completely intentional).<br>The base state of all things is energetic wave-form information, which has been confirmed by quantum physics. This is why everything can be perceived in an infinite number of different ways, because nothing can exist without being perceived and to be perceived, there must be a perceiver. When you see a rose as being red, a bee sees that same rose in shades of ultra-violet and a bat perceives that same rose as vibrations of sound. It all depends on the way that the information is &#039;read&#039; (so to speak). We not only decode\/re-decode information with our senses into what we call &#039;people&#039;, &#039;places&#039; and &#039;things&#039;, but we can also ENCODE\/RE-ENCODE information with our senses into what we call &#039;people&#039;, &#039;places&#039; and &#039;things&#039; - this is the basis of meme magic. We&#039;re encoding &#039;people&#039;, &#039;places&#039; and &#039;things&#039; with different information to what was there before, we&#039;re altering its informational substrate. The base state of EVERYTHING in the universe is ENERGETIC WAVE-FORM INFORMATION. EVERYTHING. We are literally information decoding information. Energy flows where attention goes. Things like &#039;mental illnesses&#039;\/depression\/anxiety are basically ROGUE INFORMATION.

The late scientist Emoto used to put written messages next to containers of water, then freeze the water and examine the crystals that had been formed using microscopic photography. The water that had been placed next to positive messages like &quot;I love you.&quot; turned into visually pleasing crystal formations, while the water that had been placed next to negative messages like &quot;You make me sick, I want to kill you.&quot; turned into irregular crystal formations. In the ancient Indian poem &#039;Ramayana&#039;, a bridge to Lanka is being built with stones for Rama by an army of monkey-like humanoid beings. However, the stones don&#039;t stick together to form a continuous structure. Hanuman, Rama&#039;s devotee, suggests that Rama&#039;s name be written onto the stones so that they stick together. This is done and the stones then stick together to form the bridge that they want to build. In both Emoto&#039;s experiments and that story from Ramayana, it&#039;s not the mere act of writing that accomplishes those seemingly miraculous results but the VIBRATING ENERGY FIELDS OF INFORMATION of what was written. One of the COMPLETELY FALSE assumptions of modern mainstream science is that our internal world (i.e. our thoughts, our emotions and our intentions) has NO EFFECT WHATSOEVER on our external world. But the truth is that there is NO BOUNDARY between our &#039;internal world&#039; and our &#039;external world&#039;.

It is not solid as most people think it is, because the atoms that compose &#039;the world&#039; are made of empty space. Furthermore, &#039;the world&#039; as we know it does not even exist &#039;out there&#039; - it exists only &#039;in here&#039; and is projected by us only when we tune in to it. What we call &#039;the world&#039; is like a computer simulation, which means that it is illusory and therefore malleable. What we call &#039;ghosts&#039; are beings that are so close to our frequency band that they can &#039;bleed&#039; through like a form of broadcasting interference. A radio accurately tuned to a radio station frequency will produce a clear, sharp reception with no interference, but when the dial is slightly off-centre, another station or stations can be heard alongside the main one. What we call &#039;ghosts&#039; are based on the same basic principle and reptilians (for example) are basically beings that we could think of as &#039;ghosts&#039; in that they inhabit a frequency band that vibrates very closely to the one we inhabit. To us, a &#039;ghost&#039; would not look solid - but to that &#039;ghost&#039;, we are the ones who would not look solid. There are an infinite number of frequency bands and they all share the same space usually without interfering with each other.","filename":"1470539790294","ext":".jpg","w":480,"h":200,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":52,"tim":1493214692851,"time":1493214692,"md5":"6d727qa6NMNqOhXLxUDrkw==","fsize":19104,"resto":122880882,"id":"UvCZUcby","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":122885315,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)09:52:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122885251\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122885251<\/a><br><br><br>Group meditation has been correlated to a reduction in terrorism and crime: <br><br>http:\/\/www.thewayofmeditation.com.a<wbr>u\/blog\/scientific-evidence-mass-med<wbr>itation-can-reduce-war-and-terroris<wbr>m\/<br><br>What we&#039;re doing (i.e. meme magic) works on the same principle (which is collectively focusing on something and thus energising that &#039;something&#039; with our collective focus).

This is another way to make you consciously aware that you are in a dream state.<br><br>These 2 exercises concentrate to overcome the issue that is persistent in everybodys dreams, which is the fact that even in the weirdest dream scenarios, <br>if not lucid, your brain does not implicitly realize that things are bizarre and impossible, but rather take things as they are and assume that everything is normal.<br><br>Another thing is to set an alarm in the morning, e.g 6\/7 o clock before your waking time, so that you wake up and go back to sleep for a couple hours and your chances are increased.<br><br>Another thing is to sleep into the noon or beyond, because this is the time when you are normally awake, and by sleeping during this hour, your brain might think that you should be awake, thus invoking a higher chance for consciousness to active in your dream state.","time":1493219624,"resto":122880882,"id":"uGwi\/LtF","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":122893907,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)11:14:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122889665\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122889665<\/a><br>imaginary girlfriend","time":1493219666,"resto":122880882,"id":"vcHodnhK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122893942,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)11:14:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122893062\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122893062<\/a><br>Actually everyone dreams 7 times each night, its just that you forget them.<br><br>Stop doing drugs, get enough sleep, then, whenever you eventually remember a dream, even if its just a snippet, hold onto it like its gold.<br><br>Make sure you rememeber all you can rememebr, then write it down.","time":1493219688,"resto":122880882,"id":"m6TVv72C","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"}]}

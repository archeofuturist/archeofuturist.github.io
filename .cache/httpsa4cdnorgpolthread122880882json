It&#039;s the only reason i&#039;ve managed to stop smoking, stop playing vidiya, as well as stop eating unhealthy junk. There is literally no reason to do anything unhealthy anymore. I can just do it when im asleep without having to face any negative consequences.<br><br>This sounds nice, but i&#039;m sort of scared that if people with less willpower learn to do it, they might start sleeping their life away. However, im not that concerned though, as you need some willpower to learn to lucid dream.","filename":"fancy man","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":489,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":203,"tim":1493211511403,"time":1493211511,"md5":"U1HVvAmHX9eDrj9dAWafAA==","fsize":68545,"resto":0,"id":"m6TVv72C","country":"NO","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"lucid-dreaming","country_name":"Norway","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

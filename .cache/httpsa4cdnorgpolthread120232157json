Info here:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; The party has a certain sex appeal in the Anglo-Saxon press; its rise &quot;proving&quot; how doomed Angela Merkel is after her refugee gambit (spoiler: she&#039;s not doomed). Yet as with other such parties it is also a giant bundle of mutual resentment, tension and instability. Recent weeks have seen all of these trends intensify as the party&#039;s poll numbers have dwindled. It now grazes lows not seen since before the refugee crisis.<\/span><br><br>http:\/\/archive.is\/U6bQp","filename":"eU6Wkz[1]","ext":".png","w":744,"h":505,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":169,"tim":1491709336511,"time":1491709336,"md5":"1cz89xC4AViLadLypcJTXw==","fsize":551853,"resto":0,"id":"p6kOSL88","country":"BR","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"primer-on-the-afd-wars","country_name":"Brazil","replies":2,"images":0,"unique_ips":1},{"no":120232663,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)23:46:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"Bulk of the matter:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Today&#039;s news is that Alexander Gauland, the party&#039;s leader in the state of Brandenburg, does not want to be a &quot;Spitzenkandidat&quot; (or &quot;lead candidate&quot;) in the coming general election. This is something: Mr Gauland is the grand old man of AfD politics; part of the quartet that in 2012 created the anti-euro electoral platform that would develop into today&#039;s party. He has tracked the AfD&#039;s political evolution like no other, having started off as a respectable pillar of Germany&#039;s conservative intelligentsia and ended up as a provocative voice of the populist right. <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;His rejection has less to do with ideology than with power. The AfD is led by Frauke Petry, who ousted Bernd Lucke (one of Mr Gauland&#039;s fellow founders) in 2015 and subsequently set the party on a more starkly nationalist, anti-refugee course. But now she\u2014along with her partner Marcus Pretzell, an AfD MEP with close links to other European right-populist parties\u2014wants to lay a long-term path to power. That implies two imperatives. The first, borrowed from Austria&#039;s FP\u00d6, is to make the party acceptable as a coalition partner, starting at the state level. Which means reining in liabilities like Bj\u00f6rn H\u00f6cke, its leader in the Thuringian parliament who claimed Germany should be less apologetic about its Nazi past. The second, borrowed from the French FN, is to give the AfD a sharper, more distinctive face. That means raising Ms Petry on a plinth as the party&#039;s dominant Spitzenkandidat.<\/span>","time":1491709603,"resto":120232157,"id":"p6kOSL88","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":120233869,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)23:57:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"Bump.

It is a religion of pride and spiritual death. There are some Jews who seem to retain that pride even if they are not religious, and that is also terrible. It is wrong, however, to discriminate against ethnic Jews for being ethnically Jews alone, because they may not be smug and prideful like the stereotype that all Jews are like that. It is like hip hop culture in the African American community: hip hop culture generally promotes things like violence, drugs, hustling, gang loyalty, etc.; however, not all black people are into the hip hop culture, and it is wrong to condemn all black people to that stereotype.","filename":"StarofDavidblack","ext":".jpg","w":2664,"h":3072,"tn_w":108,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492472464878,"time":1492472464,"md5":"eh93+\/mYb6gvFd7W5Pm8eQ==","fsize":582078,"resto":121600376,"id":"R2U+Ipjy","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":121603205,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)19:42:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121600376\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121600376<\/a>","filename":"1492287077164","ext":".png","w":1016,"h":622,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":76,"tim":1492472520138,"time":1492472520,"md5":"VpjZ7rntc1UtJ\/OyiUbQ3A==","fsize":269548,"resto":121600376,"id":"kuCz901V","country":"BG","country_name":"Bulgaria"}]}

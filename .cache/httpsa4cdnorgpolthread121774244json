So, prices are set at the point that maximize profit within the bounds of your variable costs. However, if this communist government happens to care for its citizens and not the producers, you would set prices equal to, or slightly higher than your Average Total Costs (ATC). The problem is, sometimes ATC is higher than Demand, in which case you would have to operate at a loss or shut down. It isn&#039;t really that complicated setting prices for goods.

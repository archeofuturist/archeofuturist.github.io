I know of three or four families in my small town alone that have fled south africa to come to england and live here where it is safe.<br><br>Most of them are simple farmers who have had their land stripped of them without compensation and the force driving them out is just the local racially motivated blacks who invade their homes with the police and government just refusing to investigate.<br><br>I remember reading an article about a couple in their 60s who lived on a remote farm for 22 years. 3 blacks broke into their house, tied them up, sodomised them, stabbed them multiple times, burnt the ladies breasts and feet with a blow torch. Shoved plastic bags down their throat to choke them, drove them out into the woods and shot them in the head and neck.<br><br>Somehow both of them survived. But it makes me feel so horrible that simple, honest and innocent folk like this have such horrible things done to them by savage and spiteful people. I wish I could bring our south african kinsmen home somehow.","time":1490718952,"resto":118665016,"id":"6n4Q1DJf","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118666430,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)12:38:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118665016\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118665016<\/a><br><br>Something needs to be done, that is for sure.","time":1490719080,"resto":118665016,"id":"M1FhAtuv","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

Perhaps it wasn&#039;t spread out in a clear manner for you, or perhaps it was a specific question asked at a broad approach. There is no need for homosexuality in a society other than as you put it, tolerance. You can tolerate someone whom you disagree with, on the base fact they are only human. Yet I don&#039;t grasp why you would tolerate or allow the progression of an act or ideology that goes directly against the progress of humankind? Be it birthrate, diseases, criminal offenses, etc as many put it. Why promote or accept something that would lead to your demise. This is where the nature part comes in, where as they response is overwhelming &quot;it&#039;s only natural&quot;. To me seems like a catch 22 in my argument since the only reply to that is that it&#039;s unnatural for human nature, since it is our nature to progress the gene pool, thereby ourselves. Given you bring up sterile people, those who cannot reproduce. I can say they are fine, since even if they tried to breed, they are unable, and not their fault, where as homosexuality are able to breed, but unwilling at a natural level (excluding surrogates or donations). Tolerance is the seemingly best counter to the question at hand, given a larger population has a very lower risk to die out, and vise versa. If you look at japan, and replaced the xbox heug population drop due to people unwilling to breed, you can take that akin to homosexuals pushing the idea that a gay life supersedes a straight life. Somewhat odd being that I am fine with homosexuals overall, but understand that they do not fit into the equation of life given the choices they make.","time":1493167721,"resto":122809183,"id":"3MT26Soz","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122816222,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)20:48:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122815232\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122815232<\/a><br><a href=\"#p122815514\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122815514<\/a><br><a href=\"#p122815598\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122815598<\/a><br><a href=\"#p122815658\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122815658<\/a><br>so it being more prevalent to have partners makes homosexuality as a concept bad?<br><br><a href=\"#p122815365\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122815365<\/a><br>The point is there is no argument against homosexuality other than &quot;I don&#039;t like it&quot;, is that hard to get?","time":1493167730,"resto":122809183,"id":"zP8gARP2","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122816242,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)20:48:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122809183\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122809183<\/a><br>It fails the first categorical imperative <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;Act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law.&quot;<\/span><br>If everyone were gay, humanity would die out","time":1493167739,"resto":122809183,"id":"qbWsVE22","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122816393,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)20:50:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122812769\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122812769<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Because homosexual sex causes more STIs than heterosexual sex (assuming both are unprotected).<\/span><br>I wouldn&#039;t say &quot;cause&quot; but it&#039;s certainly more prevalent in those groups because there&#039;s less of a push to use protection among the older guys.

Its symptoms include diarrhea, vomiting, and intestinal bleeding. <br> <br>Intestinal parasites:<br>These are microbial organisms that cause intestinal diseases including cryptosporidiosis, dysentery, and giardiasis. Symptoms include diarrhea, fever, and stomach pain. Again, these are spread through oral contact with the fecal matter of an infected person. <br> <br>Bacterial infections: If a person contracts food poisoning, the bacteria that causes it, say salmonella for example, will be shed in their feces and could be transmitted through oral-anal contact.

As one of the members of its predecessor, the German Workers&#039; Party, he was a close friend and early ally of Adolf Hitler and a co-founder of the Sturmabteilung (SA, &quot;Storm Battalion&quot;), the Nazi Party&#039;s militia, and later was its commander. <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Hitler was aware of R\u00f6hm&#039;s homosexuality. At this point they were so close that they addressed each other as du (the German familiar form of &quot;you&quot;). No other top Nazi leader enjoyed that privilege, and their close association led to rumors that Hitler himself was homosexual. R\u00f6hm was the only Nazi leader who dared to address Hitler by his first name &quot;Adolf&quot; or his nickname &quot;Adi&quot; rather than &quot;mein F\u00fchrer.&quot;<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Although determined to curb the power of the SA, Hitler put off doing away with his long-time comrade to the very end. A political struggle within the party grew, with those closest to Hitler, including Prussian premier Hermann G\u00f6ring, Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels, and Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS Heinrich Himmler, positioning themselves against R\u00f6hm. To isolate the latter, on 20 April 1934 G\u00f6ring transferred control of the Prussian political police (Gestapo) to Himmler, who he believed could be counted on to move against R\u00f6hm.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Hitler was hesitant in authorizing R\u00f6hm&#039;s execution, and gave him the option of suicide. On 1 July, SS-Brigadef\u00fchrer Theodor Eicke (then Kommandant of the Dachau concentration camp) and SS-Obersturmbannf\u00fchrer Michael Lippert walked into his cell, laid a pistol on the table, told R\u00f6hm he had ten minutes to use it and left. He refused, stating, &quot;If I am to be killed, let Adolf do it himself.&quot; Having heard nothing in the allotted time, Eicke and Lippert returned to R\u00f6hm&#039;s cell at 14:50 to find him standing, with his bare chest puffed out in a gesture of defiance. Eicke and Lippert then shot R\u00f6hm, killing him. He was buried in the Westfriedhof in Munich.<\/span>","time":1493172834,"resto":122809183,"id":"SK4fcnX4","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122827214,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)22:14:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"Homosexuality is not wrong. <br><br>Using the academic establishment to yell at straight men about homosexuality is wrong.","time":1493172855,"resto":122809183,"id":"+fhENaPC","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122827242,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)22:14:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122826930\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122826930<\/a><br><a href=\"#p122826813\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122826813<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;It doesn&#039;t count because it&#039;s not white folk<\/span><br>Then do what those quiver-full morons do and have a dozen kids with one wife in a decade. 2% of the population not falling for the nuclear family meme pushed post WW2 is not going to be the destruction of the white race.","time":1493172869,"resto":122809183,"id":"gRTj94Pg","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122827250,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)22:14:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122809183\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122809183<\/a><br>Homosexuality isnt inherently wrong\/bad.

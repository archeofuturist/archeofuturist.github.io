People voted for an economically nationalist policy, not for Carswellian free trade. Minford&#039;s model is just as wrong as D. Friedman&#039;s trade theories. They both assume frictionless trade. They unironically assume in the Liverpool model that there are no transport or logistic cost differences between trading with Wales and trading with Australia. It is bizarre. It is an empirical fact of economics that countries trade more with their neighbors. Pic related is one of the most robust trade models in econ, the Gravity Model, which shows that trade flow is inversely proportional to distance. This distance is just ignored in the Liverpool model. <br><br>The point being is that even if the Brexiteers go for &quot;global Britain&quot;, and remove all tariffs..<br><br>1. farmers in the UK are kill <br>2. they will not receive the level of trade they expect from Minford&#039;s model. They will not recoup the trade lost from the EU. <br>3. they will not achieve the growth, real or nominal they expect, while simultaneously destroying what little industry we have left. <br><br>The moral is that there are NO economic outcomes that can be justified by economics itself. All economic outcomes must be justified by an external politic. Growth is not a good in itself, neither is trade. The Brexiteers need to STOP thinking in terms of economics (they don&#039;t have a leg to stand on in this respect) and start talking about POLITICS, culture, religion, and national spirit.","filename":"gravity model ","ext":".jpg","w":654,"h":265,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":50,"tim":1490408070114,"time":1490408070,"md5":"kNLZC5HeeWvSuF\/rYupAGg==","fsize":48321,"resto":118168497,"id":"JJiv8e96","country":"GB","trip":"!!RTdZyZlKJyM","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118171159,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)22:14:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118170775\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118170775<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;BASED.<\/span><br><br>All I&#039;ll say, is that I&#039;m probably like Clayton Bigsby.","filename":"9k=","ext":".jpg","w":277,"h":182,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":82,"tim":1490408082838,"time":1490408082,"md5":"VQ5y2uhXP4nhprr7\/fcXMg==","fsize":9407,"resto":118168497,"id":"HTMlJ\/K0","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118171176,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)22:14:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118171112\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118171112<\/a><br>Bowtie lad as well","time":1490408095,"resto":118168497,"id":"d+AFwc9u","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118171182,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)22:14:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"Of all the Brit\/pol\/ tripfags who do you think is most likely to be GCHQ?","time":1490408098,"resto":118168497,"id":"F\/Iw3mJc","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118171190,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)22:15:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;that first link in the OP about Khan<\/span><br><br>What he actually said in the September story was that being prepared for terrorism attacks was &quot;part and parcel of living in a big city.&quot;<br><br>Farage is presenting the quote as if Khan is saying &quot;shit happens, whatever, just part of living in a city, why&#039;s everyone getting so worked up&quot;.<br><br>The actual quote is instead along the lines of &quot;this isn&#039;t going away, cities are the clear targets rather than villages and towns, so we (people in cities) need to be ready&quot;.<br><br>Why are you even using the Express anyway?

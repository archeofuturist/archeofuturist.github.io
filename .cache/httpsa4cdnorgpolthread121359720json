Which side are you on OP?<br><br>&quot;I think it had an influence. Constantine put people into power based on whether or not they were Christian instead of on merit. <br><br>Gibbon, author of The History of The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, &quot;pointed to Christianity. Christianity, he says, created a belief that a better life existed after death. This fostered indifference to the present among Roman citizens, thus sapping their desire to sacrifice for the Empire. He also believed its comparative pacifism tended to sap the traditional Roman martial spirit. <br><br>According to Gibbon, Romans were far more tolerant of Christians than Christians were of one another, especially once Christianity gained the upper hand. Christians inflicted far greater casualties on other Christians than were ever inflicted by the Roman Empire. Gibbon extrapolated that the number of Christians executed by other Christian factions far exceeded all the Christian martyrs who died during the three centuries of Christianity under Roman rule. &quot; <br><br>http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_Hi<wbr>story_of_the_Decline_and_Fall_of_th<wbr>e_Roman_Empire&quot;<br><br>They had it right to shun them in the start.","filename":"Jean-L\u00e9on_G\u00e9r\u00f4me_-_The_Christian_Martyrs&#039;_Last_Prayer_-_Walters_37113","ext":".jpg","w":1200,"h":700,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":72,"tim":1492356554365,"time":1492356554,"md5":"1deUUwhjXqhfM36hYf6Dig==","fsize":219898,"resto":121359720,"id":"GeyPpJea","country":"ES","m_img":1,"country_name":"Spain"},{"no":121370918,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)11:39:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121359720\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121359720<\/a><br>&quot;In February of 380 AD, Theodosius declared Christianity, based on the Nicene Creed, as the only official religion of Rome.

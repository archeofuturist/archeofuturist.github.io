I worked for a party production company back in &#039;07 doing a wedding reception at the Paladium in in downtown Waco, for which an elder security officer was contracted. I worked there to deconstruct the decorations for the venue all through the night, meaning the security guy wasn&#039;t allowed to leave until we left. So, upon taking smoke breaks on account of my melenin challanged coworkers, I had the opportunity to talk to the security guard several times. One of the nigs shot off a Koresh joke, and sparked a convo regarding the Davidians. <br><br>On the next break I was waiting for my darky coworkers to finish their shit and bring it back to the truck. The security guard continued to talk about the Davidian incident, and it&#039;s affiliation with Koresh. He informed me the he was the former evidence officer for MCSD, and was stationed at the Mt Carmel compound at the time of the event. <br><br>I figured he was just a rambling old man so I practically ignored him while I loaded stuff on the truck. I also knew much about the incident already being that I grew up in the area, so I decided to test him. I knew the door had never been recovered, so I asked him an indirect question hoping he would either follow through with discussion of the door, or just quit his bullshit so I could go home.<br><br>I asked him if there was any evidence that would suggest who shot first. He immediately said yes, and began to give me the rundown on the whereabouts of the door. He informed me that ATF was on standby for the primary confrontation, until an order was given to &quot;approach with suspicion of arms&quot; and one of the agents in the first entry team fired upon the compound. He said, specifically, that &quot;the front door&quot; was removed because it provided impunative evidence against the agents for the misjudgement of force, and was brought to his office at MCSD for storage.<br><br>Cont.","time":1493700520,"resto":123717692,"id":"YxL3fhkC","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123728466,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)00:49:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123721167\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123721167<\/a><br>Because the ATF was about to get its budget cuts<br><br>They needed to go full SWAT style raid in front of tv cameras to try to get funding, they were on the chopping block","filename":"1448654809586","ext":".png","w":1240,"h":793,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":79,"tim":1493700547157,"time":1493700547,"md5":"nA9NrRJU6yPOEORE7n+gbg==","fsize":901788,"resto":123717692,"id":"j+lMfzxC","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":123728542,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)00:49:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123728272\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123728272<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Isn&#039;t he in jail.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Adam Kokesh followed Chuck Schumer, Elizabeth Warren, Elizabeth Warren and 16 others<\/span><br><br>Sounds about right","time":1493700591,"resto":123717692,"id":"l9794Lo4","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123728561,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)00:50:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123726105\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123726105<\/a><br>It would solidify who fired first.

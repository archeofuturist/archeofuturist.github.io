Been a while since I studied it, l i spologize if I&#039;m a little off.<br><br>I&#039;m A+ blood type. What this means is that I have A antigen (short for Antibody Generators) and Rhesus (named after the monkey species it was discovered in, rhesus = Rh) on my red blood cells (RBCs). These proteins csn generate a certain type of immune system response. At the same time, I also have B antibodies in my plasma (a major part of whole blood). As an O-, you have no antigen proteins on your RBCs and have\/can develop all the antibodies in your plasma (hence why you&#039;re considered a universal donor giving RBCs and universal taker donating plasma). AB+ means they have all the antigens on their RBCs and no antibodies in their plasma (hence universal taker regarding RBCs but univeral donor giving plasma). A simple way to remember who can give RBCs to whom is by remembering that child&#039;s toy with the shape blocks and shape holes: &quot;a - can fit into a +, but a + won&#039;t fit into a -&quot;.<br><br>When an O- mother has an O+ baby the first time, her immune system will detect the O+ baby blood in the womb and develop Rh antibodies. The first baby will be fine I&#039;m sure because the antibodies won&#039;t be fully developed yet I believe. The danger comes after that when she wants another baby that may be O+ again. This time, her body has Rhesus antibodies developed that will harm thr baby. When antigen-antibody complexes are formed, they cause the blood to agglutinate (blood cells clump up and turn the blood into chunky sticky solid pieces that can cause blockages). This actually how they test blood types too, by paying attention to what samples agglutinate or not with certain does. Don&#039;t worry, there is medication to supress the Rhesus antibodies and deliver the 2nd O+ baby healthily. <br><br>Someone please correct any mistakes I made, did it all by memory.","time":1491959230,"resto":120678689,"id":"x0gSP407","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120689696,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)21:07:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120689562\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120689562<\/a><br><a href=\"#p120688964\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120688964<\/a><br>Fuuck, and I Brazilian?","time":1491959274,"resto":120678689,"id":"eIru8j9z","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120689702,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)21:07:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120689516\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120689516<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;implying it isn&#039;t for the alien war<\/span><br>A vast majority of alien abductees have a negative blood type.","time":1491959275,"resto":120678689,"id":"5pmuQyZa","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120689715,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)21:08:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120679848\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120679848<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;can only recieve from the same blood type<\/span>","time":1491959285,"resto":120678689,"id":"nfpNAepR","country":"MX","country_name":"Mexico"},{"no":120689866,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)21:09:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120689594\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120689594<\/a><br><br>Typed this on a phone, sorry for spelling errors.","time":1491959377,"resto":120678689,"id":"x0gSP407","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120689987,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)21:10:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120689516\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120689516<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I lost all my o neg blood with my guns in a tragic boating accident<\/span><br>What?","time":1491959435,"resto":120678689,"id":"yK8eA9ID","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120690241,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)21:12:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120678689\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120678689<\/a><br>My mum is Rh-, I&#039;m Rh+, I was first-born, my brother who came after is also Rh+.<br>tfw fetus me could&#039;ve killed my brother<br>but yeah apparently I&#039;m O+","time":1491959561,"resto":120678689,"id":"pmritADc","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120690331,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)21:13:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120679848\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120679848<\/a><br>finnaly a fellow 0-","time":1491959602,"resto":120678689,"id":"kbVP8wOD","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120690487,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)21:14:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120689594\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120689594<\/a><br>Sounds right.

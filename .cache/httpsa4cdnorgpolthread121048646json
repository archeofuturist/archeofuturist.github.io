In my experience, this is at least true insofar as they are more tolerable than blacks and browns of all variety. I grew up in a suburb of LA that has the highest demographic of 1st and 2nd generation East Asian-americans in the country, went to elementary\/highschool with a ton of Asians, and pursued STEM in college, so I&#039;ve had casual and friendly relationships with asians. Having been raised in multikulti Commiefornia I have even dated 2 asian girls and gotten to know their families over the course of those relationships. So my question arises not out of a state of ignorance, but of discomfort with the implications of my own observations. <br><br>So what&#039;s the deal, \/pol\/? What are Asians lacking? In my adult life when I am forced to hold casual conversations with Asians, they don&#039;t go anywhere. It almost seems like they&#039;re (relatively to other races) disinclined to novel\/creative\/independent thought. In my experience Asian-americans do not seem like balanced adults, they don&#039;t bring the same level of creative freeform thought-formation that makes interpersonal exchanged interesting and exciting, nor do they seem to experience life with the same sense of self respect and individualism that enables the better aspects of Western society.","filename":"1492160562687","ext":".jpg","w":610,"h":458,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1492168449967,"time":1492168449,"md5":"WqkF8J9YPw6we\/YR\/8fWKA==","fsize":123975,"resto":0,"id":"aF5xdWni","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"what-is-the-deal-with-asians","country_name":"United States","replies":293,"images":33,"unique_ips":63,"tail_size":50},{"no":121048705,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)07:15:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"I can see that they have somewhat of a drive toward measurable personal achievement, and that they abide by a collectivist morality.

Various factors have been examined with respect to affective empathy, but the role of culture has received little attention. Previous work suggests that children from East Asian cultures compared to those from Western cultures experience greater personal distress and less empathic concern <br><br>. Consistent with research on children, East Asian adolescents reported greater personal distress and less empathic concern than their Western counterparts. The bicultural individuals\u2019 scores fell in between the East Asian and Western groups, but revealed significant differences from their \u2018uni-cultural\u2019 peers, demonstrating shared influences of community and family. Importantly, however, the relationship between affective empathy and social-emotional health in bicultural individuals was the same as for Western individuals. The current results provide an important first step in understanding the different cultural influences on empathic responding in a previously understudied population \u2010 bicultural individuals.<br><br>http:\/\/booksandjournals.brillonline<wbr>.com\/content\/journals\/10.1163\/15685<wbr>3710x531203","time":1492169274,"resto":121048646,"id":"aF5xdWni","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121049737,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)07:28:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"fuck off OP i know what you&#039;re trying to do you faggot","time":1492169316,"resto":121048646,"id":"SMapc1Oy","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121049807,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)07:29:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"Wee, new thread<br><br>Britjew, please don&#039;t post here, I just get visions of you in a gas chamber.<br><br>Anyway, look up Intense World Theory to understand analytical mindsets - how people can both be quite sensitive but also quite aversive.

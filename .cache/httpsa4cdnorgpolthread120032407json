If Trump does nothing, he appears weak, and it invites mischief from other countries. But if he launches 59 Tomahawk missiles at a Syrian military air base base...<br><br>1. He just solved for the allegation that he is Putin\u2019s puppet. He doesn\u2019t look like Putin\u2019s puppet today. And that was Trump\u2019s biggest problem, which made it America\u2019s problem too. No one wants a president who is under a cloud of suspicion about Russian influence.<br><br>2. He solved (partly) for the allegation that he is incompetent. You can hate this military action, but even Trump\u2019s critics will call it measured and rational. Like it or not, President Trump\u2019s credibility is likely to rise because of this, if not his popularity. Successful military action does that for presidents.<br><br>3. He just set the table for his conversations with China about North Korea. Does China doubt Trump will take care of the problem in China\u2019s own backyard if they don\u2019t take care of it themselves? That negotiation just got easier.<br><br>4. Iran might be feeling a bit more flexible when it\u2019s time to talk about their nuclear program.<br><br>5. His plan of a Syrian Safe Zone requires dominating the Syrian Air Force for security. That just got easier.<br><br>6. Syria\u2019s government just got more flexible. It probably wants to keep the rest of its military.<br><br>If it turns out that the sarin gas attack that sparked this military action didn\u2019t come from Assad, it doesn\u2019t much matter. President Trump will bank all of the benefits above even if the attack turns out to be a hoax. We know Assad had some chemical weapons at one point, and probably used them. No one will be crying for Assad if the attack was unnecessary. And realistically, the public will never be 100% sure who was behind the attack.","time":1491602661,"resto":120032407,"id":"E1HYE9i1","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120032801,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)18:04:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120032407\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120032407<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;(((They))) will not divide us<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;407<\/span><br><br>gerMonies<br><br>this timeline is confusing<br>Trudope and Nutley should have the answers","time":1491602679,"resto":120032407,"id":"HdcANBGo","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120032806,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)18:04:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120032407\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120032407<\/a><br>You see that guy with the water hose, hosing down that other guy with that other guy holding that person with gloved hands? they do that to wash the gas away","time":1491602680,"resto":120032407,"id":"3q44f1CI","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120033973,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)18:12:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120032806\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120032806<\/a><br>Washing it off doesnt help the voctim when its sarin though.

All the talk about getting rid of Assad suddenly, is probably just talk. Trump well-known to say outrageous things to stir up a controversy then back off.

The general public is bored and annoyed with both of those perspectives. Meanwhile the alternative media has just been given a huge window of opportunity to articulate the case for keeping Assad. Hopefully this will kickstart a real discussion about what to do in the mid east. Trump supporters have always had subtle pro-regime sentiments because they know that the &quot;freedom loving rebels&quot; that Obama was arming are actually just Wahhabi terrorists.

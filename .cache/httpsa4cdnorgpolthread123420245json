I&#039;ve been trying to mobilize, educate myself, and work towards the goal of strengthening my nation, but it feels so pointless and empty. I&#039;m a student at a relatively liberal college, and it feels as though anything I do is pointless. The town my college is in is relatively affluent and racially homogeneous, but it doesn&#039;t feel like it matters at all. Everyone here believes that diversity is the greatest good possible; when I ask someone why diversity is good, no one can tell me anything more than diversity is good for the sake of it bringing more diversity. It makes no fucking sense. <br><br>If possible, \/pol\/, boost my spirits. Make me feel like it isn&#039;t all pointless or hopeless, please. The world just feels so pointless right now.","filename":"Shit_is_on_fire","ext":".jpg","w":582,"h":537,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":230,"tim":1493517952957,"time":1493517952,"md5":"Z4rqFmpJlFNKxExJmTtMJA==","fsize":48945,"resto":0,"id":"f6L4Kb8U","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"are-we-fucked","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

THE FUCKING MUDSLIMES ARE INFILTRATING OUR SCHOOLS:<br>We received a message this morning from a concerned mother, about her son and his school. This was what she wrote; &quot;dear IPM, I wanted to make people aware of what is going on in irish schools. My son is in second year in a school on the northside of dublin he informed me last week that the religion class had been about islam etc. This alone was not a major issue until he told me the religion teacher was making the children kneel on a prayer mat and perform Islamic prayers before each class. He also informed me that they were due to visit a mosque at some stage in the near future. He felt uncomfortable with this and asked could he be excused from this class, i permitted him to do so. This week I was asked to a meeting in the school and during this meeting was asked why he was excused from the religion class. I explained he it was not the religion class he was excused from but the Islamic practises that were taking place in this class. I was informed that this was part of the curriculum. I also made it clear that no parents were contacted for permission for their children to take part in these practises, and that my son would not be taking part. Reluctantly the school agreed to compromise. But I just wonder how many schools are doing the same thing without parents knowledge. Btw the school is a catholic school which I thought would have more sense. Please please let parents know what could be happening with their children in schools.

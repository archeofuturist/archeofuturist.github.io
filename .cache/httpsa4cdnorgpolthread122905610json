What I am driving at is the narrative that Hitler is the absolute archetype of evil is completely unjust. This also allows for unfair comparisons and demonetization of political opinions mostly pushed by communists. <br><br>Communists by FAR have the most blood on their hands and are viewed by the general public as less threatening and less &quot;evil&quot; than Hitler or fascism. Communists have the ability to get on a soapbox and talk about their ideas (or even attack innocent people) without automatic rejection from most people. However put a fascist on a soapbox and the general public&#039;s reaction is MUCH different!<br><br>This needs to change! The free ride communists get in this society is unacceptable!<br><br>I do not mean to imply that communists don&#039;t have a right to free speech. I do mean to imply however that their ideas and results of their actions need far more exposure! By that, fascism needs more exposure as well, exposure from more than one mainstream narrative!<br><br>Lets wake society up \/pol\/!<br><br>We are already leading the charge with free speech rallies. These rallies are getting all kinds of exposure from MSM and independent journalist alike. Antifa might be rolling back on the violence (possibly) even if they aren&#039;t before violence kicks off patriots need to carry signs with these death tolls and pictures of Stalin, Lenin, Mao, etc! Say things like &quot;Communism kills!&quot; Possibly things saying worse than Hitler, but that might not be the optics we want.<br><br>Communism must be exposed!<br> <br>pt. 2","filename":"13","ext":".jpg","w":399,"h":398,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":124,"tim":1493225632765,"time":1493225632,"md5":"tl3L9TKy9xC2FBQehZjrrw==","fsize":35800,"resto":122905610,"id":"pC5O1PTJ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122905746,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)12:53:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122905610\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122905610<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;le yuri maymay<\/span><br><br>&quot;Cultural Marxism&quot; doesn&#039;t exist.<br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=odh<wbr>hGmwxZ5I","time":1493225638,"resto":122905610,"id":"o2jNLjkT","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":122907151,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)13:06:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122905746\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122905746<\/a><br>kys","filename":"1492584421283","ext":".jpg","w":4621,"h":2914,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":78,"tim":1493226395005,"time":1493226395,"md5":"ont6\/wMoeuyHlF\/L+XZ2cg==","fsize":1401393,"resto":122905610,"id":"pC5O1PTJ","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":122907972,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)13:13:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"bampu","time":1493226833,"resto":122905610,"id":"pC5O1PTJ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

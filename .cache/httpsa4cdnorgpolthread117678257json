This is my home board, I love you scumbags. I&#039;m writing a Political Philosophy paper and I don&#039;t speak to any of the leftist queers in the seminar so I need to have a discussion somewhere. Any input and discussion would be much appreciated.<br><br>Either I answer the question on Marx critique of Capitalism or one on Liberty. The Marx question seems a little dull and there is already boundless material evaluating it already. I&#039;m more interested in the question on Liberty therefore I would like to gauge some different responses\/viewpoints. Lets try and keep memeing and shit flinging to a minimum.<br><br>So, what is the greatest threat to Liberty in the United Kingdom today? I am planning to argue that the greatest threat to liberty in the UK is the culture of &#039;political correctness&#039; which shuts down logical debate concerning serious issues (immigration, islamisation of societies, leaving the EU) and how the cult of social media attemots to stop people from speaking about un-popular beliefs and opinions. Effectively shutting down free speech through attempts of character assassination (labelling someone homophobic\/xenophobic\/racist\/white-<wbr>supremacist). I&#039;m curious as to how popular my answer will be with the person grading however I feel it should not matter as they are always bitching about how 99% of the papers they receive argue the same point.<br><br>TLDR; Discussion - What is the GREATEST threat to Liberty in the United Kingdom today?","filename":"sjw","ext":".jpg","w":1098,"h":947,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":215,"tim":1490134353405,"time":1490134353,"md5":"e9lW0hxf5ra1AypUMmgSIA==","fsize":234828,"resto":0,"id":"kbUWfuBb","country":"GB","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"lets-talk-liberty","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":2,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":117678482,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)18:14:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117678257\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117678257<\/a><br>Pakis","time":1490134470,"resto":117678257,"id":"XgzPnk7t","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":117678533,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)18:14:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Let us not be mistaken about what we must understand by our independence.y There is in fact a kind of corrupt liberty, the use of which is common to animals as it is to man, and which consists of doing whatever [69] you please. This liberty is the enemy of all authority; it suffers all rules with impatience; with it, we become inferior to ourselves; it is the enemy of truth and peace; and God believed that he had to rise up against it! But there is a civil and moral liberty that finds its strength in union, and that the mission of power itself is to protect; it is the liberty to do without fear all that is just and good. This holy liberty we must defend at all cost, and if necessary, at risk of our life.<\/span><br><br>The greatest threat to liberty OP is choosing to misuse it and then affirming every cognitive fallacy in your grasp to try and defend the misuse of liberty","time":1490134492,"resto":117678257,"id":"ovWqln\/p","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

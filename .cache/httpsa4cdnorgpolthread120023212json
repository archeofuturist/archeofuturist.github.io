Also, to be fair, we&#039;d have to time travel back 5000 years to make the year 777.<br><br>My point, if it&#039;s not plain already, is that apparent correlations are easily manufactured by our minds to prove any theory that we are predisposed to.

Just as Cyrus did not know God but was used by God to bless his people Israel, likewise Trump is not a Christian but would be used by God as president to do good.

We are to listen to them and then judge or scrutinize the prophecy because many false spirits have gone out into the world (1Jn 4:1).<br><br>How do we do this? There are several tests to discern a message. The most direct is when there is Scripture on the same topic. When someone makes a claim that does not line up with the written revelation of God, then it could not have come from God (Isaiah 8:20). Scripture &quot;trumps&quot; (pun intended) words and personal prophecy.<br><br>Another factor, as mentioned above, is that extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof. When Moses claimed to be sent to liberate the entire nation of Israel from slavery, they did not have to take his word for it. He was equipped by God with three signs: the ability to 1) turn water to blood, 2) turn his hand leprous and 3) turn his staff into a snake (Exodus 4:1-9). This established him beyond question as a prophet to those he was sent. Other prophets of the Bible made prophecies that came true or did miracles to establish they were sent by God.<br><br>This is the pattern of the Bible. God does not expect or want us to accept great claims without the great proof previous prophets could provide. Unless a proven, established prophet like Daniel or Isaiah declares that Trump has been set up by God as king like was done for Nebuchadnezzar (Dan 2) and Cyrus (Isaiah 45), respectively, then it is a suspect claim that deviates from the pattern of biblical revelation and biblical prophets.","time":1491602179,"resto":120023212,"id":"940G3fu9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120031745,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)17:57:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"Conclusion<br><br>For the reasons and Scripture cited above, I see no clear, unbiased evidence that God put Trump in power to bless the nation or even Christians\u2014although obviously God could and has in the past done so for other kings (Dan 2:21).

Humans need a scapegoat, and the in-group society is strengthened through the killing of the out-group, this is the problem but also the solution to the problem, a sort of ventilation of chaos. Jesus knew that by receiving the sins of the world he would take them away, and this explains &quot;they know not what they do&quot;. He went willingly because he knew his death was necessary. He is the meta-hero, the hero of heroes, the perennial man. Christ is the culmination of all prior religions.<br><br>Even today, the Jews reject logos.

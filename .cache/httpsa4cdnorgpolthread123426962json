Is that worthy of Britain? Is that to be the future of Europe? And is this competition to be organised within our European brotherhood? Bringing in these sweat-fields in Africa into our Europe civilisation, so that the financial power in one European country can use it against the financial power in another? Or the great financial central power of the world, now shifted from the City of London to Wall Street, New York? Shall be able on the mass of money, of wealth and of power which it brings to it?

That abandoned IT system cost them \u00a310b. I&#039;ll do my own research on the highly-paid freelance doctors etc.<br>But that&#039;s not the reason why the NHS is fucked. Come on mate - it&#039;s the biggest and best funded healthcare provider on the planet. By all rights it should also be the best, but it&#039;s not even remotely close. It&#039;s a national disgrace rather than a national pride. It gets \u00a3117b per year - they aren&#039;t spending all of that on expensive managerial consultants.<br>For example, in Wales in 2011, the NHS spent less than 2% of their budget on all premises (maintenance AND new hospitals). 46% went to staff (not just pay, but insurance, etc). 8% went to prescriptions and drugs. Why only 2%? <br><br>Nurses get around minimum wage because until fairly recently, they didn&#039;t even need qualifications. Senior (qualified) nurses can make up to \u00a370k per year (plus generous overtime) on the NHS.<br><br>Accept it mate. They&#039;re taking us for a ride.

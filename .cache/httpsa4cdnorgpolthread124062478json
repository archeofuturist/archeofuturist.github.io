Though I am pleased that 50% of my life as described by Wikipedia no longer involves an event that I had absolutely nothing to do with, I am surprised that Wikipedia continues to allow Gamaliel to remain an administrator when she has shown such bad faith in this matter. The following sentence she wrote in this section is simply false:<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;If national magazines, newspapers, and radio programs can mention this, why can&#039;t Wikipedia? Gamaliel 23:06, 16 March 2006<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;One magazine mentioned Lori&#039;s death and it issued a retration with an apology from James Wolcott. Why? Because they were facing a libel lawsuit if they did not. No newspaper has EVER suggested I had anything to do with Lori&#039;s death. There has never been a hint of my involvement. I can&#039;t speak to radio programs but I would guess they would have called me if they had broached this subject. I brought it up on Don Imus&#039;s show three years ago. But of the hundreds of thousands of words I have uttered on TV, radio, on the floor of Congress and in speeches all across America, I hardly think a throw away line in 2003 justifies 7% of my bio being polluted by your suggestions that have placed me in a false light on Wikipedia for years. I continue to ask why you are so obsessed when your history of activity on my sight casts Wikipedia in the worst of light.<\/span>","time":1493907685,"resto":124062478,"id":"EZtchpTN","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":124064381,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)10:24:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124062478\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124062478<\/a><br>This makes Trump cucking Joe even funnier:<br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Awa<wbr>pEgZrukA","filename":"donald-j-trump-real-donald-trump-6h-i-dont-watch-5053716","ext":".png","w":500,"h":463,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":115,"tim":1493907846428,"time":1493907846,"md5":"JO1rAipbLWZRUfv+H0uL1Q==","fsize":101151,"resto":124062478,"id":"tSOMOCcw","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":124064713,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)10:27:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124064151\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124064151<\/a><br><br>I vaguely remember some controversy but had forgotten what it was.<br><br>Any respect I had for him is gone.","time":1493908044,"resto":124062478,"id":"4is5dRY0","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124065288,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)10:33:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124064381\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124064381<\/a><br><br>If a man had felt a woman&#039;s head like that, even on invitation, the feminists would have gone batshit.","time":1493908421,"resto":124062478,"id":"4is5dRY0","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124065657,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)10:37:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124064381\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124064381<\/a><br>kek","filename":"Screen Shot 2017-05-04 at 10.36.59 pm","ext":".png","w":837,"h":431,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":64,"tim":1493908656662,"time":1493908656,"md5":"RZtyzrfzocADvk\/r66vpUg==","fsize":461998,"resto":124062478,"id":"dYGra2\/T","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":124066197,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)10:43:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"He should fuck her, but no way should he marry that bitch.<br><br>This is going to end badly for him","time":1493908988,"resto":124062478,"id":"t6lZVpfV","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124066616,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)10:47:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124062478\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124062478<\/a><br>Aw, good for them.","time":1493909245,"resto":124062478,"id":"ykBuRCnU","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124066859,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)10:49:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"I had watched that show almost every morning, since like 2008.

The shills may think they have won by fracturing the communities, but all they have succeeded in doing is turning a single cellular organism into a multi cellular one. If one image board goes down or is shilled we have back ups and it is much more difficult to shill multiple communities than it is to shill one. I encourage you all to browse at least one other image board and help it grow. This will make us stronger.","filename":"multi_cellular6_h-550x410","ext":".jpg","w":550,"h":410,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":186,"tim":1493129169934,"time":1493129169,"md5":"hoNRCIwy3YZ3sRlOaUCITA==","fsize":64057,"resto":0,"id":"bS2OaNTy","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"multicellularpol","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":122737066,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)10:07:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"Thanks for that rousing speech rabbi.","time":1493129220,"resto":122736988,"id":"Urfgu73z","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122737561,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)10:12:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122737066\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122737066<\/a><br>Kys, shlomo.","time":1493129541,"resto":122736988,"id":"bS2OaNTy","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

I wish i was exaggerating too... <br><br>Anyway, the essay is about a group that has to fight against inequality. Im choosing the white male -- to trigger her. I need 4 topics to cover. Ive done Diversity Quotas\/ Affirmative Action, double standards for niggers and women against men, and i need two more. I&#039;m thinking the third would be general rhetoric in the media, like hillary saying the primary victims of war is women and so on. So i need at least one more topic. Any suggestions? Two suggestions would be most helpful, i would rather something more concrete than general rhetoric.","filename":"1488579898046","ext":".jpg","w":960,"h":1280,"tn_w":187,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490316050840,"time":1490316050,"md5":"lC27o7eWmbhRlMOsR4exqQ==","fsize":440011,"resto":0,"id":"awuVGnd3","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"sup-pol","country_name":"United States","replies":4,"images":0,"unique_ips":5},{"no":118013190,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)20:42:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118012963\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118012963<\/a><br>also claim to be jewish and if he criticizes your paper based only on emotion call him an anti-Semite","time":1490316154,"resto":118012963,"id":"5UR2M6eN","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118013244,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)20:42:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118012963\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118012963<\/a><br>sauce on your pic","time":1490316179,"resto":118012963,"id":"qx+h2jU+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118013398,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)20:44:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118012963\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118012963<\/a><br>bump for interest","time":1490316248,"resto":118012963,"id":"fkoYfyPt","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118013482,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)20:44:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118013190\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118013190<\/a><br><br>this<br><br>use their tactics against them<br><br>also say that you are LGBT and autistic to get more people on your side","time":1490316287,"resto":118012963,"id":"rx3qPEep","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

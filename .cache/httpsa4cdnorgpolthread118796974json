She became extremely depressed and a massive bitch (she was also going through menopause at the time), and it was unpleasant. I&#039;m grown and out on my own now, but my mom is much happier being a home maker (budget, cleaning, cooking, etc) than working. It made my home much better when she quit working (not from a financial standpoint, but from every other aspect). <br>One of my best friends growing up was basically raised in daycare and always like being over at our house because my family functioned like a family. His mom is overly clingy and he avoids his family a lot. It&#039;s pretty sad.<br>Basically, you want your kids to be raised by their mother and not in a daycare. A mother raising her children is her most important role and should be her priority.","time":1490802561,"resto":118796974,"id":"oWfKxOJO","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

Japan&#039;s population is decliming because o their moern culture! Not because of a lack of immigration. Same with Korea!! It is their own faults for being too stupid to celebrate family values, marriage, living in bigger land, not caring about dumb office jobs or graduating from so lame university that everyone says you have to in order to make money. <br><br>It is their lame modern culture that promotes a lack of children and not caring for elderly. It is their vanity and their version of the bad part of western culture such as status driven people. <br><br>In old days in Japan and Korea they had large families and farmed and there were so many people. <br><br>Immigration has nothing to do with it. HOw is it Japan if it&#039;s full of foreigners then? Simply because there is an economy in a boundary? CULTURE MAKES A COUNTRY!!!

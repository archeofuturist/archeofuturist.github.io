The expedition consisted of Leichhardt, four Europeans, two Aboriginal guides, seven horses, 20 mules and 50 bullocks.The Europeans were Adolph Classen, Arthur Hentig, Donald Stuart and Thomas Hands, a ticket of leave holder who replaced Kelly at Henry Stuart Russell&#039;s Cecil Plains station. The Aboriginal guides were Wommai and Billy Bombat, from Port Stephens.[7][8]<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The party was last seen on 3 April 1848 at Allan Macpherson&#039;s station, Cogoon, on the Darling Downs. Leichhardt&#039;s disappearance after moving inland, although investigated by many, remains a mystery. The expedition had been expected to take two to three years, but after no sign or word was received from Leichhardt it was assumed that he and the others in the party had died. The latest evidence suggests that they may have perished somewhere in the Great Sandy Desert of the Australian interior.[2]<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Abo Guides<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Billy Bombat<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Wommai<\/span><br><br>I KNEW IT","filename":"Ludwig","ext":".jpg","w":2504,"h":3430,"tn_w":91,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491226034625,"time":1491226034,"md5":"zOQHedsjW44R4Kjoxba7FA==","fsize":597056,"resto":119320854,"id":"nbmhPfoK","country":"DE","m_img":1,"country_name":"Germany"},{"no":119327930,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)09:27:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119321254\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119321254<\/a><br><a href=\"#p119321189\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119321189<\/a><br><a href=\"#p119321085\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119321085<\/a><br><a href=\"#p119321047\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119321047<\/a><br><br>well. wouldn&#039;t be surprised by some CIA angle to it. they obfuscate every hit as some-one else&#039;s work, so this would be no different.","filename":"1484226310106","ext":".png","w":578,"h":302,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":65,"tim":1491226054391,"time":1491226054,"md5":"lt602krok7uHSxSOCFD5\/w==","fsize":53093,"resto":119320854,"id":"F6N0Q8Dc","country":"CZ","country_name":"Czech Republic"},{"no":119327932,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)09:27:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119327816\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119327816<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What a time to be alive!<\/span><br>Fucking cruel, you madman","time":1491226055,"resto":119320854,"id":"rwpErDIM","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":119327936,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)09:27:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119327172\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119327172<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Implying there are flags but false flag<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;implying the entire history is not just a 100 sided goo that is played by a 12-dimensional vampiric overmind against itself<\/span>","time":1491226056,"resto":119320854,"id":"xtZGul4w","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":119327954,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)09:27:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119327737\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119327737<\/a><br>I don&#039;t see it as a bad thing.<br>Not that I follow his agenda: he&#039;s doing good by exposing filthy corruption, but as a politician he&#039;s utterly incompetent and have no qualities needed to be one.<br>Everyone should understand that he&#039;s doing what he&#039;s doing mostly for PR, even if it&#039;s useful in uncovering corruption.<br>But again: it is a good thing on itself.","time":1491226065,"resto":119320854,"id":"LP7+geRN","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":119327955,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)09:27:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119320854\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119320854<\/a><br>Saint-Petersburg here, two blasts, 12 dead, subway is shut down, additional packages found.

Under Bulgar command, the entire invading Byzantine army was destroyed. The Bulgars, although the ruling class, were much less numerous than the Slavs and Thracians, of which there were many, and therefore quickly assimilated into Slavic culture (although many aspects of Bulgar and Thracian culture remained), until by the 10th century they had adopted the Slavic language, with the Bulgar language going extinct in the kingdom (Bulgaria also created the Cyrillic alphabet :D). This is what happens when the Bulgars were &lt;1% of the total population. Yet the country has their name, which is astounding! Bulgaria is the oldest country in Europe that hasn&#039;t changed its name since it was first established!<br><br>Between 600-900AD, basically we&#039;re just going back and forth fighting the Byzantines and growing. Christianized in the 9th century as well.","filename":"Bulgaria","ext":".png","w":1920,"h":1259,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":163,"tim":1490420688568,"time":1490420688,"md5":"JGjXVJhm7krVuT49kp97pw==","fsize":758761,"resto":0,"id":"i5cnzJt2","country":"CA","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"what-was-your-country-doing-between-600-and-900","country_name":"Canada","replies":11,"images":2,"unique_ips":7},{"no":118192034,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)01:45:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"I&#039;ll do Canada as well for the fuck of it, since I&#039;m here right now.

But no, Jones says, he\u2019s not a bad influence on his kids. In fact, the kids are big fans of the \u201ccomedy memes\u201d he appears in, because he\u2019s a \u201cnumber one meme.\u201d How many fathers out there can truly say that about themselves? It\u2019s probably very few.<br><br>The idea of Jones crying because a lawyer is being mean to him may not seem especially funny, but let\u2019s not forget that he\u2019s a \u201cSandy Hook truther\u201d who believes that the shooting at the school was a hoax. Now picture him on the stand, suddenly robbed of all of his bluster, crying because a lawyer is pushing him too hard. It\u2019s hilarious.<br><br><br>http:\/\/www.avclub.com\/article\/alex-<wbr>jones-brags-hes-number-one-meme-dur<wbr>ing-custod-254069","time":1492849557,"resto":122252819,"id":"3gUAlOWq","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

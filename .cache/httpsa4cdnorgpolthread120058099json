As many have mentioned already, it was a fucking retarded idea (at least on initial inspection) for Russian and Syrian forces to deploy such illicit weaponry and shoah a bunch of kids when conventional ordinance was doing the job just fine. Well, this would explain their motives for the chemical attack. They blatantly violate the Geneva Convention, giving Trump pretext to show that he isn&#039;t cucked by Ivan. America and the Russians get into a diplomatic pissing match and put on a good show for the media and the faggots at the UN.<br><br>End result: Trump gains new-found bipartisan support at home, while Putin can continue his military campaign against the jihadists without losing face in the eyes of the Russian people.<br><br>This is fantastic! This is God-tier political maneuvering. Trump is playing 7.5-Dimensional infinite chess while his detractors are playing tic-tac-toe by drawing on the carpet with their own shit.

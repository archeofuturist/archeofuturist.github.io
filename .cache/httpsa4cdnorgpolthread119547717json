They see us all as &quot;dumb redneck&quot; RacistNaziKKK cartoon characters rather than people. Logically it follows that we can&#039;t have any legitimate reasons for our beliefs, rather they must all be due to us being stupid and evil.","filename":"1490711029943","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":500,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491374113531,"time":1491374113,"md5":"OT7PvFTaCc5nbCaYiz0Bkg==","fsize":144378,"resto":119547717,"id":"BRaedtYf","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119577712,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)02:36:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119549566\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119549566<\/a><br><a href=\"#p119547717\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119547717<\/a><br><a href=\"#p119549566\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119549566<\/a><br>What subleddit are these posts from anyway?","time":1491374200,"resto":119547717,"id":"cJsl4eaS","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119577830,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)02:38:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119566941\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119566941<\/a><br>A LEAF!!!","time":1491374283,"resto":119547717,"id":"yj3ggyBR","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119577857,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)02:38:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119566635\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119566635<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;suburban and rural retards<\/span><br>It&#039;s &quot;rural and suburban retards&quot;, you rural and\/or suburban retard.","filename":"1491107185376","ext":".png","w":871,"h":871,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":124,"tim":1491374304693,"time":1491374304,"md5":"og2l5uj66Poz+6y76iLXfw==","fsize":711939,"resto":119547717,"id":"5l+TCoXj","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119577953,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)02:39:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119547717\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119547717<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;conservatives are immune to reality<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Conservatives are the only ones aware and agree that trump is president<\/span>","filename":"Wedding Sunflowers","ext":".jpg","w":3008,"h":2000,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1491374374642,"time":1491374374,"md5":"tYFhrNaB5eIZ3w0PjiotcQ==","fsize":1923803,"resto":119547717,"id":"Ag5MmiG+","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":119578017,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)02:40:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119576190\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119576190<\/a><br>I&#039;m pretty sure that first part is copypasta.

When they enter their first day of high school they&#039;ll be fiercely aware of the left&#039;s attempts to indoctrinate them. <br><br>My 12 year old nephew makes outlandish pro-Trump statements to get a rise out of people, and he throws around terms like &quot;fake news&quot; and &quot;special snowflakes&quot;. Both of his parents are yuppy leftists living in Boston, so it&#039;s not something he learned at home. <br><br>These kids don&#039;t watch the news or give a shit about mainstream media. They follow streamers on YouTube and Twitch RELIGIOUSLY, and this sets them off on a journey down the rabbit hole. Pewdiepie alone redpilled 50 million kids, who went on to redpill their social circles. This generation&#039;s rebellion will be against SJW ideology. <br><br>The media is still largely oblivious to what&#039;s going on with the youth. They have a tenuous hold on about half of the millennial population, maybe a bit more than half, but they&#039;ve COMPLETELY dropped the ball on brainwashing Gen Z, and when these kids start getting older it&#039;s gong to be fucking glorious watching them go to war with a bunch of shithead middle aged millennials.<br><br>Pic related: my 12 year old nephew shared this on Facebook. It was a share of something his 12 year old friend posted. Both of these kids live in a liberal stronghold.

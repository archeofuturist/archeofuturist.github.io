How is it not the same to just bend your torso toward your legs, like in pic related, and just rest your arm on your legs, like in pic related? You can bend pretty far like that and still be comfortable. In fact, the toilet seat is more comfortable if you bend instead of squat like that because more surface area of your ass is touching the bowl lid.","filename":"stock-photo-man-missing-you-wearing-a-long-sleeve-shirt-black-pants-brown-leather-shoes-short-haircut-a-224857600[1]","ext":".jpg","w":300,"h":470,"tn_w":79,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491154145746,"time":1491154145,"md5":"P9Av3wQ94FxdCfXsl49ZRA==","fsize":52797,"resto":119214730,"id":"+jiwAjCC","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119222066,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)13:33:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119215880\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119215880<\/a><br>mods","time":1491154431,"resto":119214730,"id":"\/x4rOEN7","country":"SA","country_name":"Saudi Arabia"}]}

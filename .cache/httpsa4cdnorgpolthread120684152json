Justin Trudeau is a former boxer, snowboarder, and environmentalist. Name me one &quot;real&quot; man who can claim even two of those things! Secondly, Canadians aren&#039;t shitposters. We speak our feelings. We tell you the truth. We share our opinions. If that&#039;s what counts as shitposting these days, then call me an Aussie. I don&#039;t know why Americans are so intimidated by hearing genuine, thoughtful criticism of their country and their politics, but you obviously are. All I can say to that is: deal with it. It&#039;s the 21st century. This is the information age. If information scares you, then go back to your bumfuck trailer somewhere and hang on to your delusions. Me? I&#039;m a freethinker. I&#039;m an idea man. I thrive off of enthusiasm. And I fucking love science. So when a Canadian is nice enough to offer you constructive criticism, take it as a compliment.

Was he just a troubled individual who believed too much nonsense? Was it all the &quot;drugs, man&quot; and freed his mind until he blew it? Was he some crazy guy or an Mk Ultra victim? Was he taken out for his small following? Any thoughts or known stories about him? It&#039;s a fact that the CIA and Rick Ross happened to find contras but is everything else he said just nonsense? A broken is right twice a day, but this crazy fucker scares me with his thoughts on GMO, Fukushima reactor, global warming, etc. It seems everything that can go wrong already HAS started.","filename":"maxresdefault","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":960,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1493351648737,"time":1493351648,"md5":"xFt7N9Hf4Ozoh8\/wC4wc1g==","fsize":102513,"resto":0,"id":"fbrgpY2s","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"redpill-please","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":1,"unique_ips":3},{"no":123144972,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)00:14:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"He got whacked.","filename":"junior-soprano","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":576,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1493352853256,"time":1493352853,"md5":"Deix+PaJSbJLBKWHQHpMYQ==","fsize":252721,"resto":123142477,"id":"OYvh+brI","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123148314,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)00:42:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"I followed him through 2009-ish.<br>He was troubled.<br>A bit silly.<br>He had a breakdown.<br>Went native.<br>DMT and everything.<br>Nutty.<br>I could believe he whacked himself.<br>People usually off themselves in special places.

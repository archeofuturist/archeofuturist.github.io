No matter your degree or course of study you are required to take intro classes. It varies from each university\/college to the next. Generally you need a language credit, math credit, science credit, and several humanitarian or social study credits. In many cases you are required to take classes focused on diversity disguised as humanitarian\/social study courses. Women&#039;s studies, African American studies, Native American studies etc. They offer an extremely wide selection and everyone has to take them. All of them focus on telling you whites are bad, men are bad, right wing ideals are bad for them, and diversity is good. Then they wander around campus talking with people all taking similar classes and parroting what they just heard. So it becomes a massive echo chamber. Any dissenting opinions are automatically labeled hate speech and you are reported to the dean and kicked out of college. College is one of the greatest tools (((they))) have at their disposal.","time":1492391646,"resto":121452113,"id":"MQ5p0DVc","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121454638,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)21:15:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121453843\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121453843<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;about how Tchaikovsky was gay.<\/span><br>I didn\u2019t even know this desu.","time":1492391704,"resto":121452113,"id":"COAKFpxO","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":121454915,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)21:16:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121454638\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121454638<\/a><br>He probably wasn&#039;t but if he didn&#039;t marry and worked along side any men then liberals will paint him as gay and hold him up as a brave and progressive example locked in a troubled accepting period of history. <br><br>All of that instead of focusing on his masterful music compositions.","time":1492391811,"resto":121452113,"id":"MQ5p0DVc","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121454956,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)21:17:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121452113\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121452113<\/a><br>They fell for the &#039;teachers actually know wtf they&#039;re talking about&#039; meme. 99% of teachers are stupid, sheltered normies who would be dead within a month if shit hit the fan.","time":1492391824,"resto":121452113,"id":"DkCzb5Ok","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121455394,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)21:20:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121454956\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121454956<\/a><br>Remember the old saying : &quot;those who can&#039;t do, teach&quot;","time":1492392007,"resto":121452113,"id":"drXRAhZC","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121455483,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)21:20:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121454505\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121454505<\/a><br>Interesting.","time":1492392045,"resto":121452113,"id":"COAKFpxO","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":121455770,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)21:22:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;ITT nu-pol&#039;s mental gymnastics on display to rationalize the state of education without naming them.<\/span>","time":1492392170,"resto":121452113,"id":"sup1OEmn","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121455789,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)21:22:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121454956\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121454956<\/a><br>Teachers aren&#039;t necessarily terrible, but you are correct when you say they rely to heavily on them.

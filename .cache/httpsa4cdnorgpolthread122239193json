I played games literally all my childhood, how was I supposed to just stop as a teen and do something constructive instead? Children and teens are retarded and need guidance. <br><br>My parents were home much, they were kind and loving, no problems there, but they let me do pretty muchy what I wanted as long as I wasn&#039;t being a cunt, and they didn&#039;t teach me much of anything. <br><br>Of course I have a goal and aims now, but I am an adult now. As I said, kids and teens need guidance, if given that then they will enter adulthood as skilled individuals, not a blank-slate with low social skills due to growing up in front of a screen, who need to start learning what actually guided teens started to learn when they were 15. <br><br>When I have kids I will strive to actually TEACH them things that will make them more valuable to society in general, and make them feel more accomplished about themselves (which builds self confidence).","time":1492855843,"resto":122239193,"id":"52chgVKj","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":122261682,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)06:16:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"I don&#039;t know.

Not a single value I have comes from them. <\/span><br>My parents didn&#039;t care much either that i spent hours on end every single day in front of the computer when i was a kid. Did i care? Hell no, games where fun and addictive as hell and there wasn&#039;t much to do anyway since i lived rural af. My values are like 100% from the internet, parents didn&#039;t give many words or advice or imprint their ideology on me, then my mother was all surprised when i was 16 and basically a far right extremist in her eye.<br><br>If i ever have kids i will put more pressure on them then i had, if they fiddle around with to much technology i will just shut of the power and not turn it on again until they have cut a and stacked half a cord of wood or something like that. They might hate me then but they will thank me later.","time":1492856649,"resto":122239193,"id":"mMBnc70M","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":122262347,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)06:25:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122261950\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122261950<\/a><br>You can also have your doctor if you&#039;re into that kinda thing.","filename":"Screenshot (4)","ext":".png","w":1920,"h":1080,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1492856746421,"time":1492856746,"md5":"VnBxxXul0pLL1tdvC3QQPw==","fsize":2473060,"resto":122239193,"id":"twzagSYO","country":"DE","m_img":1,"country_name":"Germany"},{"no":122262626,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)06:29:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122243572\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122243572<\/a><br>Open world meme is a fad all of us could live without.

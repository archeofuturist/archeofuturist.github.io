On Tuesday, Lambda Legal joined the suit, which seeks damages for breach of contract, negligent misrepresentation, and the intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress. Zawadski and Gaspari aren\u2019t suing the funeral home for engaging in anti-gay discrimination because Mississippi does not protect LGBTQ people from refusal of service. Indeed, the state\u2019s notorious HB 1523 actually protects businesses\u2019 right to turn away LGBTQ customers\u2014though the courts have put that law on hold for now.<br><br>Initially, the nearby Picayune Funeral Home seemed like a perfect choice, and Gaspari paid the company $1,795 to transport and cremate Huskey\u2019s body once he passed. But when Huskey died and the nursing home contacted the funeral home to pick up his body, it refused to do so. The funeral home had discovered that Huskey\u2019s next-of-kin was his husband, and realizing Huskey was gay, informed the nursing home that it did not \u201cdeal with their kind.\u201d","filename":"urn","ext":".jpg","w":450,"h":450,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493758535238,"time":1493758535,"md5":"V1p5v7PgCP\/FWUdDGSQAxQ==","fsize":71251,"resto":0,"id":"UOfJ+qHL","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"man-sues-antigay-mississippi-funeral-home-for","country_name":"United States","replies":8,"images":1,"unique_ips":5},{"no":123819042,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)17:03:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123818002\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123818002<\/a><br>bump","time":1493759034,"resto":123818002,"id":"kpNI7vaj","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123819124,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)17:04:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123818002\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123818002<\/a><br>It&#039;s amazing that we have reached a point where businesses are not permitted to choose whom they do or do not serve if it&#039;s based upon some criteria, such as, religion, sexuality, etc, etc. Understandably, this originated with the civil rights fiasco that normies proclaim as being a &quot;win&quot; for the good guys.

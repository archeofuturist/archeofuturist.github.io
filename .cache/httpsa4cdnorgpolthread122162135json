The undeniable truth bombs dropped on me when I actually got into debates and had to question what I&#039;ve been taught about history and genetics changed me. I didn&#039;t even realize when it happened, exactly. Someone on \/pol\/ would make a crazy claim and I&#039;d ignore it. But then they&#039;d back it up with sources, so I&#039;d take the time to look into them and struggle to find something that refuted it.

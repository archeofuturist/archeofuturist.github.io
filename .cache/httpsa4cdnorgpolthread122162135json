The undeniable truth bombs dropped on me when I actually got into debates and had to question what I&#039;ve been taught about history and genetics changed me. I didn&#039;t even realize when it happened, exactly. Someone on \/pol\/ would make a crazy claim and I&#039;d ignore it. But then they&#039;d back it up with sources, so I&#039;d take the time to look into them and struggle to find something that refuted it. But a lot of refutations of things like racial differences in impulse control or behavior are just &quot;this has been criticized for it&#039;s racist implications&quot; without any actual discussion of the evidence.<br><br>\/pol\/ is still 90% bullshit and slide threads or flat earthers come and shit up a lot of threads, but the sources are easy to debunk.

It&#039;s not comforting, it doesn&#039;t conform to what my left-wing worldview used to be. I never entertained these ideas before. I was normal. Popular and successful, even. No reason to be bitter, no failures in life that I need to blame someone else for, like so many people claim is what drives racism. The red pill is the uncomfortable reality of the situation in the world. I don&#039;t want it, I just can&#039;t deny it.

Judaism, Christianity and Islam all involve worship of the same God, an alien god.<br><br>Christianity, with it&#039;s endless preaching of &quot;turning the other cheek&quot; and &quot;loving one&#039;s neighbour&quot; (where neighbour is defined as EVERYONE) smell suspiciously of the suicidal altruism of social justice.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Luke 6:29<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;If someone strikes you on one cheek, turn to him the other also.

Christ was militarised in order to appeal to Anglo-Saxons and probably Scandinavians (I know most about the conversion of England unfortunately).<br><br>To me (no expert, just a searcher after knowledge), it looks like the modern, fluffy Christianity is actually closest to the words Jesus spoke.<br><br>Which leads me to the conclusion that if we have to cure ourselves of our &quot;help the world&quot; agenda and renew western civilisation, we have to abandon this weak cuck religion and return to worshiping our own gods, with our own moral lessons. (I also think that returning to a pagan reconstructed religion would help promote traditional gender roles and improve fertility).<br><br>Let me know what you think \/pol\/.

Deep reverence for its own past and for the wisdom of its ancestry and pride therein were the very soul of the Old Paganism; that is why it formed so solid a foundation on which to build the Catholic Church, though that is also why it offered so long and determined a resistance to the growth of the Catholic Church.

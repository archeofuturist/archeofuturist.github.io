Was it too long, or too unpopular? Either way, I&#039;m trying to revive it!<br><br>***********************<br><br>There are a lot of apologists for Christianity on \/pol\/ but there&#039;s no way around the fact that Christianity is a Jewish invention of the Middle-East. Judaism, Christianity and Islam all involve worship of the same God, an alien god.<br><br>Christianity, with it&#039;s endless preaching of &quot;turning the other cheek&quot; and &quot;loving one&#039;s neighbour&quot; (where neighbour is defined as EVERYONE) smell suspiciously of the suicidal altruism of social justice.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Luke 6:29<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;If someone strikes you on one cheek, turn to him the other also. And if someone takes your cloak, do not withhold your tunic as well.<\/span><br><br><br>Before you flood this thread with muh crusade memes, be aware that Christianity had to be painfully twisted in able to be accepted by those who already lived in Western Europe. Christ was militarised in order to appeal to Anglo-Saxons and probably Scandinavians (I know most about the conversion of England unfortunately).<br><br>To me (no expert, just a searcher after knowledge), it looks like the modern, fluffy Christianity is actually closest to the words Jesus spoke.<br><br>Which leads me to the conclusion that if we have to cure ourselves of our &quot;help the world&quot; agenda and renew western civilisation, we have to abandon this weak cuck religion and return to worshiping our own gods, with our own moral lessons. (I also think that returning to a pagan reconstructed religion would help promote traditional gender roles and improve fertility).<br><br>Let me know what you think \/pol\/. I&#039;m interested in hearing both your opinions on western paganism\/heathenism and also defences of Christianity.","filename":"Odin&#039;s Blessing","ext":".jpg","w":720,"h":720,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492779317091,"time":1492779317,"md5":"gSUNJ4asRNeyxhDjX8VFcw==","fsize":183623,"resto":0,"id":"g3TcViyR","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"pretty-new-to-4chan-though-ive-lurked-a-long-time","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

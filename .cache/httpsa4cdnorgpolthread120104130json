To be an owner, they restrict you heavily and it&#039;s difficult to own a team regardless of how much money you have due to the potential of the owners getting privy to what it is (they have to trust\/own you).

The players have always had quirks, what you see and how they promote their endeavors is designed. <br><br>In case nobody saw it the past 2 years, the deep state wanted a federal police force, not local police. Why else do you think the media which had always loved police got smashed? Why do you think all the nogs got promoted for wearing pig socks, even though they were shit players? Hillary&#039;s loss shifted this plan, but they will keep at it until they get it. <br><br>They want authority over the states completely, they have to remove local\/state police. They need federal level control. <br><br>This SJW shit promotes compliance and dependency on the federal level across all states. No federal cop will defy the state at the risk of losing their home and sending their family to the poor house. A local cop answers to the local state, not the feds...see colorado\/washington and legal weed, or local sheriffs defying unconstitutional gun regulations with open letters.

It&#039;s our\/their version of Drones<br>Rome&#039;s gladiator games. Wonder why networks like ESPN went apeshit for social justice? Wonder how they get government money to build new stadiums (colosseums) on the tax payer dime? Why they get military f22&#039;s to fly over the games? <br><br>The NFL is a deep state propaganda machine and one part of the many &quot;cohesive&quot; glues that bind a country the size of Europe. <br><br>The players and even coaches have no clue. To be an owner, they restrict you heavily and it&#039;s difficult to own a team regardless of how much money you have due to the potential of the owners getting privy to what it is (they have to trust\/own you). Otherwise we&#039;d have Saudi Princes owning teams.

The players have always had quirks, what you see and how they promote their endeavors is designed. <br><br>In case nobody saw it the past 2 years, the deep state wanted a federal police force, not local police. Why else do you think the media which had always loved police got smashed? Why do you think all the nogs got promoted for wearing pig socks, even though they were shit players? Hillary&#039;s loss shifted this plan, but they will keep at it until they get it. <br><br>They want authority over the states completely, they have to remove local\/state police. They need federal level control. <br><br>This SJW shit promotes compliance and dependency on the federal level across all states. No federal cop will defy the state at the risk of losing their home and sending their family to the poor house. A local cop answers to the local state, not the feds...see colorado\/washington and legal weed, or local sheriffs defying unconstitutional gun regulations with open letters. That shit goes bye bye when the cops answer to the federal government. <br><br>It&#039;s a tool. They have many. This specific tool appeals to a specific demographic. You guys can&#039;t see this shit?

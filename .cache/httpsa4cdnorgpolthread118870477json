After the massive genetic bottleneck humans experienced due to some extreme die-off, people migrated rapidly across the globe and settled when it became convenient to do so. Some became civilizations with actual archaeological structures that exist today, other tribes made do with earthen mounds and wooden structures. What many neglect to realize is that the increase in land mass in the North would&#039;ve been counteracted by an increase in the ice cap so settlement would&#039;ve been a damn near impossible unless there was a literal ice-structure civilization.","time":1490846158,"resto":118870477,"id":"o49D7S\/R","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118879035,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)23:55:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118878115\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118878115<\/a><br>oops its because i&#039;ve literally not even made a dent in my hyperborea folder lol, im just kind of posting willy nilly, in my head i already know where im going, so i could see how this gets pretty confusing hahah<br><br>im not sure how to do a run down because the basic premise is the same as most ideas of hyperborea and proto indo european stuff, but i like to really show the connections and make it clear that this stuff is not bullshit<br><br>essentially aryans lived in the ancient far north when the earth looked different and there were different animals, people, places, etc. I could go on and on about the possibilities of how they lived based on what was inherited later on.

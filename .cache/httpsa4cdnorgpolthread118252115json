No more destructive than alcohol, less destructive than Tobacco, and I think with legalization you&#039;ll actually end up seeing a reduction in average potency (mind you there will be extremely high potency stuff on the market, just like with alcohol there&#039;s everclear, but there&#039;s more beer and wine drinkers than everclear drinkers)<br><br>CBD oils and the like should still be produced for medical purposes, and more studies should be done on the right doses and exact mixtures of cannabinoids that are most effective for some illnesses. Those shouldn&#039;t be taxed.<br><br>The other drug I&#039;m 100% behind legalization of is Psilocybin\/Psilocin\/Mushrooms. They&#039;ve had legal magic truffles Netherlands, and they&#039;re not causing a big problem. Psilocybin is not a habitual drug, no addiction, and generally low risk for health problems unless you misidentify a mushroom.<br><br>I WOULD be okay with low doses of cocaine in foods like how coca cola used to be made I think that REFINED cocaine is the problem causer there rather than the low doses that exist as the Ameriindians eat it.

Blame goes entirely on DNC and left wing politics if you ask me.","filename":"NSAfucked","ext":".jpg","w":824,"h":842,"tn_w":122,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490375140734,"time":1490375140,"md5":"hPlxGQgYgy0e9J7Kweu2tA==","fsize":99917,"resto":118069235,"id":"eMDOQ5xY","country":"SI","country_name":"Slovenia"},{"no":118101885,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)13:07:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118100137\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118100137<\/a><br><br>there was numerous anonymous &#039;computer science investigation&#039; against trump.<br><br>the truth is simply that there&#039;s lots of dirt on hillary and really no dirt on trump.<br><br>foreign powers have been interfering in our politics for the last 40 years. this is the year that that changed, and that is exactly why exactly these accusations are being brought up.","time":1490375234,"resto":118069235,"id":"X1jdup34","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118102143,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)13:09:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118073223\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118073223<\/a><br>nice try, shill<br>she sad that a cyber attack would be treated as a conventional attack, and that our response would be conventional warfare<br>it&#039;s pretty rich coming from the left since they turned on a fucking dime in May2016- after saying for months that OMG TRUMP WILL START WW3 WITH RUSSIA, overnight changed their tune and in unison asserted OMG TRUMP IS A PUTIN PUPPET<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;kek &lt;--- this one right here<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;kek<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;kek<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;kek<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;kek<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;kek<\/span>","time":1490375380,"resto":118069235,"id":"jnen9wAm","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118102467,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)13:12:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"AAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH CCCCOOMMMMMMMEEEEEEE ONNNNN!!!<br><br>here are proofs! russians admit it! see then moving their lips and telling the truth: we did it all!<br><br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=kuR<wbr>QRoVlo3M<br><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/-67KapYivHQ","filename":"531308882fca61ae2640b7178bdeeb2c5eaa46a4d93bf5127cad85e9d3424b46","ext":".jpg","w":625,"h":351,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1490375565792,"time":1490375565,"md5":"tfRTcaiSQqWsOJpOwsjwtg==","fsize":52047,"resto":118069235,"id":"gAJ+IjTB","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":118103813,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)13:25:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118101708\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118101708<\/a><br><a href=\"#p118101885\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118101885<\/a><br><br>If there is no dirt on Trump at all and released information is the complete and truth then I&#039;m wrong, and it wasn&#039;t one-sided outcome. <br><br>If there is dirt on Trump and it wasn&#039;t found or it wasn&#039;t released, then it was one-seded outcome.<br><br>I wish I have more info to make any certain statements.","time":1490376317,"resto":118069235,"id":"WiE6bjr5","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":118104811,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)13:34:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118069235\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118069235<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;be deep state scum<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;be afraid of rope day<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;blame corruption performed by your grunts on russia, miserably fail in common sense and general logic<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;confirm corruption<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;tell goys: muh evil russia<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;redpill the few people left with an actual, functioning brain<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;heal divide induced by an (((ideology))), have the americans in the end thank russia for revealing just how incredibly rotten you are<\/span>","time":1490376856,"resto":118069235,"id":"ZiU7cI40","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":118104823,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)13:34:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118069235\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118069235<\/a><br>Since the fall of the Soviet Union, Russia has experienced a major rebirth of Orthodox Christianity and moving more and more to an open economy.

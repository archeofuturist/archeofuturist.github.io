Imports are only 15% of the US economy. Compare these 15% to Germany\u2019s 40%, Switzerland\u2019s 50%, the Netherlands\u2019 75%, Hong Kong\u2019s 200%. In comparison to other high-developed economies, the United States import close to nothing. Due to being surrounded by oceans, the US economy is historically isolated. The trade deficit of the US stems from the overvaluation of its (petro-)dollar and contributes little to the overall economic situation. <br><br>The general perception that America is declining is false as well. \u201cMake America great again\u201d? It was never greater than today. Between 1980 and 2017, industrial output doubled. Private household wealth grew fivefold. The Dow Jones Index by a factor of 16. Even adjusted for the inflation, which was far lower during the 1980-2017 period than in the 1970s, these numbers are impressive: total US household wealth stands at $90.2 trillion \u2013 almost one in every third dollar in the World belongs to an American. <br><br>The distribution of this added wealth is another story. And, arguably, the reason why the US middle class feels threatened. Half of the US has close to no wealth. The top 1% own half of it. Even China, Mexico and Indonesia perform better in this regard. And this is what actually worsened between the 1980s and today: while top 1% household incomes tripled, median wages mostly stagnated. The US hasn\u2019t been ripped off by another country: some Americans have been ripping off other Americans since 1980. <br><br>How this became possible? Which phenomena transformed the United States from a broad middle-class society to an oligarchy with African dictatorship-tier inequality? Why are negative economic indicators, such as social mobility, debt deflation, credit defaults, actual unemployment, inequality, wage-to-capital ratio as alarming as right before the Great Depression?","time":1493835178,"resto":123938965,"id":"jIJH7tSw","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":123941028,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)14:13:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123940986\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123940986<\/a><br><br>Popular left-wing arguments blame the following: the decline of unionization (from 35% to below 10% today), NAFTA and the WTO membership of China, skyrocketing CEO compensation, the financialization of the housing and education markets, H-1B visa abuse, changed management culture, a minimum wage that doesn\u2019t keep up with inflation, irregular employment schemes, reduced top income tax and capital tax brackets, capital market globalization, the increasing role of lobbies and big money in politics, be it Democrats or Republicans. These trends may be summarized as \u201cneoliberalism\u201d, the Reagan-Thatcher free market, state rollback revolution that happened in the 1980s, displacing the egalitarian \u201cNew Deal\u201d and \u201cGreat Society\u201d programs in the US. Similar market-liberal trends occurred in Germany (Agenda 2010), the United Kingdom (New Labour), France (tournant de la rigueur), Japan (Abenomics) and, obviously, on the whole Post-Soviet territory. <br><br>More sophisticated explanations, demanding economic knowledge to comprehend, include: automation, which, for the first time ever, is proven to lead to technical unemployment in certain sectors \u2013 while industrial output in the US keeps growing, factories employ less actual people. The financialization of the whole economy drowned private households, banks and governments in debt, leading to a decline in real investment. Finally, the abandonment of the post-war Keynesianism (1949-1979) might provide \u201cthe hint of the century\u201d to why 1979 was such a breaking point for wage growth. Wage stagnation, in turn, led to \u201csecular stagnation\u201d of the whole economy. <br><br>Either way, the rise of economic populism around the globe signals that our economy is ripe for reform.","time":1493835197,"resto":123938965,"id":"jIJH7tSw","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":123941387,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)14:16:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"Fuckin jews.","time":1493835411,"resto":123938965,"id":"FacUhsat","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123941440,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)14:17:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123938965\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123938965<\/a><br>Saudi Arabia and US own the economy of the world using an oil monopoly.<br>Federal Reserve promotes mad consumerism and steals from you.<br>The point of national debt is to turn you into an interest slave without your consent.","time":1493835447,"resto":123938965,"id":"CXYKMIFi","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123941701,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)14:19:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123940986\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123940986<\/a><br><a href=\"#p123941028\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123941028<\/a><br>Eh.

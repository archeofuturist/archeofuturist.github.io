In 2013 the UK spent 8.5% of its GDP on healthcare, about $227.6 Billion. Their population was 64.1 million. If I were to re-adjust the spending to the population of the USA which is about 319 million. The cost would be about $1.133 trillion. In the USA we already spend $1.191 trillion on Medicare and Medicaid combined. So my question is could the USA switch to single payer without increasing taxes from where they are right now?","filename":"16299118_1637282323243278_4764201811001063810_n","ext":".png","w":480,"h":272,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":141,"tim":1490417124329,"time":1490417124,"md5":"WhwfF0Yz2ZSm7WWU\/\/d5Ww==","fsize":187933,"resto":0,"id":"uVpGGih5","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"red-pill-me-on-single-payer-in-usa","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":1},{"no":118187062,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)00:46:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118186905\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118186905<\/a><br>-By just turning Medicare + Medicaid into a single payer system.","time":1490417218,"resto":118186905,"id":"uVpGGih5","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

WTF!?","com":"His weekend show is hilarious, he trolls idiots and liberals, he shitposts, he makes great points and etc. So why isn&#039;t he more popular amongst people here? Does anyone here even watch his late night weekend show!?<br><br>Just as the most recent example he mocked Rachel Maddow and the whole Russian conspiracy bullshit. Rachel Maddow imitation starts a couple minutes in, you can watch here:<br><br>http:\/\/insider.foxnews.com\/2017\/04\/<wbr>02\/gutfeld-spoofs-rachel-maddow-sho<wbr>w-trump-russia-connections-tax-retu<wbr>rn-report <br><br>Gutfeld also curses, calls liberals out by name in hilarious fashion, makes WILDLY inappropriate jokes and comments (we&#039;re talking stuff like you&#039;d see on this fucking board here) etc all on air ON FOX NEWS itself.<br><br>That Rachel Maddow bit isn&#039;t even quality content compared to a lot of his stuff. In fact, it wasn&#039;t really all that funny compared to a large amount of his shit. Why the fuck doesn&#039;t he get more credit? Perhaps not enough tune into Fox News late night on weekends hardy harr harr... thing is, his show is better than most other late night bullshit shows.","filename":"gutfeld points out the liberal faggots","ext":".jpg","w":1200,"h":675,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1491247477169,"time":1491247477,"md5":"sbncV+v+m8OkHWXwXspp8g==","fsize":46460,"resto":0,"id":"KdIlq7Ci","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"greg-gutfeld-not-popular-on-pol-wtf","country_name":"United States","replies":21,"images":1,"unique_ips":17},{"no":119368687,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)15:28:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119368175\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119368175<\/a><br>Yea, Gutfeld is great.

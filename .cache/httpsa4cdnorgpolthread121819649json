In 2014 I started learning about Israel, paying attention to the Michael Brown story, and spending a lot of time arguing with feminists on Instagram- so I started feeling like a conservative, right-wing type. Trump popped up and I was super on board, spending all day on pol trying to keep up with the latest happenings and feeling so self-righteous. Then I heard Trump&#039;s AIPAC speech and things sounded off, I did some research and realized that he&#039;s actually a kike with a lot of corrupt connections. I started to realize that the government put on big elaborate shows but that society and reality as we know of them are totally false. I learned about the Satanists, and I started to become aware of their presence in my own town. Now I&#039;ve developed into a paranoid schizophrenic hard-core anti-semite with traditionalist values, Christian identity and interest in new-age, alternative history ideas.","time":1492589664,"resto":121819649,"id":"PeQbR6ft","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121821411,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)04:23:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"Started as centrist and I&#039;m still centrist.<br>Just look at specific policy and argue for it if it makes sense and be open that your perception of the world is wrong.<br><br>I changed my view on being pro EU after I realized that neoliberal policy aims to supress wages to profit the rich.<br><br>Next election I&#039;m afraid I have to vote Linke, all others want war.<br><br>I hope Assad wins.","time":1492590226,"resto":121819649,"id":"i1TVlc9v","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":121821577,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)04:26:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121819649\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121819649<\/a><br>You&#039;ll be full-on right wing when blacks, queers, and women start shooting people for being white or male or rioting for no fucking reason like is happening in the US.","time":1492590388,"resto":121819649,"id":"YF89EBIc","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121821697,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)04:28:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121819649\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121819649<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;liberal in Bush years<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;nationalist in Obama years<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;liberal in Trump years<\/span><br>Anything to not be one of the normies.","time":1492590499,"resto":121819649,"id":"9Z\/XR7dp","country":"RS","country_name":"Serbia"},{"no":121822150,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)04:35:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;started in 2013<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;panslavic white nazi, wannabe-skinhead<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;moved to more intelligence nationalism and conservatism, still pro-russian<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;2014, the war started<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;My city full of russian hirelings and chechens<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Zrada.jpg<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;recognized russia as neosoviet shithole<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;moved from Russian empire 2.0 to Hetmanat 2.0<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;become an autoritharian capitalist<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;become from atheist to Ukrainian ortodox<\/span>","filename":"yXy3ZrhxjJc","ext":".jpg","w":622,"h":960,"tn_w":80,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492590953907,"time":1492590953,"md5":"6p3gIdB4s5iTLBYs3TGnOw==","fsize":71562,"resto":121819649,"id":"T0o7Moez","country":"UA","country_name":"Ukraine"},{"no":121822381,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)04:39:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121819649\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121819649<\/a><br>libertarian to righting extremist.","time":1492591148,"resto":121819649,"id":"yy4ohsqa","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

FBI snooped on Trump tower, found nothing. There never was any reason to suspect Trump of any involvement with Russia, let alone investigate. It was all fabricated.<br><br>PREVIOUS THREADS <br><br>#1 <a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/118045725#p118045725\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118045725<\/a> \u2192<br>#2 <a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/118059984#p118059984\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118059984<\/a> \u2192<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;PASTEBIN WITH ALL INFO NEEDED: http:\/\/pastebin.com\/fgMX926P<\/span><br><br>* TeaLeaves kicked off the whole Russia-Trump server thing with his DNS logs. This server has been mentioned in connection to investigations.<br><br>* Nobody knew who TeaLeaves was. Some speculated it was L Jean Camp herself which is the closest guess. It turned out to be a colleague of hers. See the info above for the damning proof. <br><br>* Tealeaves has a years-old wordpress account coincidentally named in leetspeak teakettle (t34k3ttl3). That&#039;s him. BTW I don&#039;t believe that FeelTheEmailMistake guy found it the way he says. I think he had to present it in a more eh &quot;public safe&quot; manner if you get my drift. Based on some other posts of his i think this guy is into some seriously heavy shit...and think about the timing of all this.<br><br>* The DNS logs contain + signs -- meaning recursive nameserver-nameserver queries which just doesnt happen. Even if we say the Russian nameservers have some weird setup -- well, the American medical nameservers have the same weird setup. Every damn nameserver has the same weird setup. Terribly unlikely...<br><br>* The guy mentions 6 indicators of forgery... says hes only &#039;reasonably confident&#039; based on the indicator above... but it&#039;s pretty fucking damning all by itself. My suspicion is that another indicator is based on meticulous analysis of TTLS and cache behavior","filename":"tumblr_nqtxhaDF1S1t6vkcqo1_1280","ext":".gif","w":640,"h":453,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":176,"tim":1490449212669,"time":1490449212,"md5":"TGJ9IiO2S0CMxgP6I1juAw==","fsize":612527,"resto":0,"id":"EKxJRbNd","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"clinton-crony-forged-dns-logs-for-russia","country_name":"United States","replies":12,"images":3,"unique_ips":8},{"no":118225073,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)09:41:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"FeelTheEmail appears:<br> <br>http:\/\/archive.is\/hrdjK<br> <br>FeelTheEmail double checking on \/r\/sysadmin:<br> <br>http:\/\/archive.is\/6HR8s<br> <br>The_Donald thread:<br> <br>http:\/\/archive.is\/5XWb7<br> <br>Evidence:<br> <br>http:\/\/archive.is\/3g911<br> <br>LJean logs:<br> <br>http:\/\/archive.is\/HvKA5","filename":"tumblr_nj0ohwZjiP1scirugo1_400","ext":".gif","w":400,"h":600,"tn_w":83,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490449281767,"time":1490449281,"md5":"yiUx2Qg9aAHR+GuPOlROFA==","fsize":755501,"resto":118224969,"id":"EKxJRbNd","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118225586,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)09:47:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"bump","time":1490449635,"resto":118224969,"id":"bdjn\/Uqh","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118225734,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)09:48:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"None of the so-called happening threads posted ever seem to gain traction outside of this website.

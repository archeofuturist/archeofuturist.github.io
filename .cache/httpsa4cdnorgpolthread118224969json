FBI snooped on Trump tower, found nothing. There never was any reason to suspect Trump of any involvement with Russia, let alone investigate.

This server has been mentioned in connection to investigations.<br><br>* Nobody knew who TeaLeaves was. Some speculated it was L Jean Camp herself which is the closest guess. It turned out to be a colleague of hers. See the info above for the damning proof. <br><br>* Tealeaves has a years-old wordpress account coincidentally named in leetspeak teakettle (t34k3ttl3). That&#039;s him. BTW I don&#039;t believe that FeelTheEmailMistake guy found it the way he says. I think he had to present it in a more eh &quot;public safe&quot; manner if you get my drift. Based on some other posts of his i think this guy is into some seriously heavy shit...and think about the timing of all this.<br><br>* The DNS logs contain + signs -- meaning recursive nameserver-nameserver queries which just doesnt happen. Even if we say the Russian nameservers have some weird setup -- well, the American medical nameservers have the same weird setup. Every damn nameserver has the same weird setup. Terribly unlikely...<br><br>* The guy mentions 6 indicators of forgery... says hes only &#039;reasonably confident&#039; based on the indicator above... but it&#039;s pretty fucking damning all by itself. My suspicion is that another indicator is based on meticulous analysis of TTLS and cache behavior","filename":"tumblr_nqtxhaDF1S1t6vkcqo1_1280","ext":".gif","w":640,"h":453,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":176,"tim":1490449212669,"time":1490449212,"md5":"TGJ9IiO2S0CMxgP6I1juAw==","fsize":612527,"resto":0,"id":"EKxJRbNd","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"clinton-crony-forged-dns-logs-for-russia","country_name":"United States","replies":228,"images":69,"unique_ips":115,"tail_size":50},{"no":118225073,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)09:41:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"FeelTheEmail appears:<br> <br>http:\/\/archive.is\/hrdjK<br> <br>FeelTheEmail double checking on \/r\/sysadmin:<br> <br>http:\/\/archive.is\/6HR8s<br> <br>The_Donald thread:<br> <br>http:\/\/archive.is\/5XWb7<br> <br>Evidence:<br> <br>http:\/\/archive.is\/3g911<br> <br>LJean logs:<br> <br>http:\/\/archive.is\/HvKA5","filename":"tumblr_nj0ohwZjiP1scirugo1_400","ext":".gif","w":400,"h":600,"tn_w":83,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490449281767,"time":1490449281,"md5":"yiUx2Qg9aAHR+GuPOlROFA==","fsize":755501,"resto":118224969,"id":"EKxJRbNd","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118225586,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)09:47:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"bump","time":1490449635,"resto":118224969,"id":"bdjn\/Uqh","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118225734,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)09:48:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"None of the so-called happening threads posted ever seem to gain traction outside of this website.

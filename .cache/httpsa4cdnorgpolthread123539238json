The tenants !!! God took away their lot! They didn&#039;t believe the messiah !<br><br>He went on to tell the people this parable: \u201cA man planted a vineyard, rented it to some farmers and went away for a long time. 10 At harvest time he sent a servant to the tenants so they would give him some of the fruit of the vineyard. But the tenants beat him and sent him away empty-handed. 11 He sent another servant, but that one also they beat and treated shamefully and sent away empty-handed. 12 He sent still a third, and they wounded him and threw him out.<br><br>13 \u201cThen the owner of the vineyard said, \u2018What shall I do? I will send my son, whom I love; perhaps they will respect him.\u2019<br><br>14 \u201cBut when the tenants saw him, they talked the matter over. \u2018This is the heir,\u2019 they said. \u2018Let\u2019s kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.\u2019 15 So they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him.<br><br>\u201cWhat then will the owner of the vineyard do to them? 16 He will come and kill those tenants and give the vineyard to others.\u201d<br><br>When the people heard this, they said, \u201cGod forbid!\u201d<br><br>17 Jesus looked directly at them and asked, \u201cThen what is the meaning of that which is written:<br><br>\u201c\u2018The stone the builders rejected<br> has become the cornerstone\u2019[a]?<br>18 Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces; anyone on whom it falls will be crushed.\u201d<br><br>19 The teachers of the law and the chief priests looked for a way to arrest him immediately, because they knew he had spoken this parable against them. But they were afraid of the people. ((( they hated Jesus !!!!))) wake<br>Up we can kill all degeneracy through spreading of Christianity !!!

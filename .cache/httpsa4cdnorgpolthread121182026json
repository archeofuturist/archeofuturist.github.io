That afternoon 300 American soldiers came ashore near here. Their landing was unopposed: there were no British regulars in town, and York&#039;s militia had withdrawn from further combat in return for its freedom during the American invasion three months earlier. The invaders seized food and military supplies, then re-embarked. The next day they returned to investigate collaborators&#039; reports that valuable stores were concealed up the Don River. Unsuccessful in their search, the Americans contented themselves with burning military installations on nearby Gibraltar Point before they departed.<\/span><br>HAHAHAAHA","filename":"closeup face meme","ext":".png","w":240,"h":240,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492240690747,"time":1492240690,"md5":"nhHFS6VzRJdUN3QkxghYyQ==","fsize":79783,"resto":121182026,"id":"TVcwo3rE","country":"LB","country_name":"Lebanon"},{"no":121184053,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)03:18:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121182026\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121182026<\/a><br>go the fuck to bed muhommad or better yet<br>\u0627\u0644\u0631\u062f \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0647\u0630\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0646\u0635\u0628 \u0623\u0648 \u0623\u0645\u0643 \u0633\u0648\u0641 \u064a\u0645\u0648\u062a \u0641\u064a \u0646\u0648\u0645\u0647\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u064a\u0644\u0629.","time":1492240704,"resto":121182026,"id":"9ImfdfKz","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121184090,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)03:19:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121183765\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121183765<\/a><br>afghanistan","time":1492240743,"resto":121182026,"id":"lxsbZA+D","country":"PF","country_name":"French Polynesia"},{"no":121184186,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)03:20:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121183957\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121183957<\/a><br>You idiots lost 60% of your invasion man power to 300 brits on a hill and the general leading them fought even after a bayonet wound and a bullet to the chest, and only died at sunrise when the battle was over.<br><br>You don&#039;t think this man isn&#039;t vanguarding this nation from Americunt degeneracy in the Spirit Realm?<br><br>You better fucking hope he isn&#039;t.<br><br>Get a culture and then come an invade, k?

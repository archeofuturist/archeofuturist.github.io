It&#039;s called GBA+ and stands for Gender Based Analysis Plus. Cuckdeau uses this to eliminate whites from immigration and explains they only let in rapefugees, gays, trannies, Africans, gooks, paks -- no WHITES. Trannies and mentally ill ones yes, but not straight whites. They only let in poor ones too because socioeconomic standing is a valid ground to discriminate on in this &quot;model&quot;.

The physical characteristics that distinguish male from female (sex) and the socially, culturally and historically defined characteristics associated with \u201cfeminine\u201d and \u201cmasculine\u201d (gender) are both important ways to identify individuals who may experience an issue in a similar way.<br><br>Not all individuals identify with a binary concept of sex or gender categories of male and female, masculine and feminine.

Canada has always been a popular destination for students, workers and visitors from around the world, and this popularity is growing at a remarkable rate. In 2015, Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada processed more than two million temporary resident applications and extensions, which was an increase of more than 18 percent over the previous three years. Temporary immigration represents a significant contribution to Canada\u2019s labour market and to our economy in general.

In 2015, IRCC processed applications (new and extensions) from 1,588,590 persons seeking temporary resident visas to come to Canada, 82.3% of which were approved. IRCC continued to be successful in promoting the use of multiple-entry visas, which are valid for up to 10 years and allow applicants from visa-required countries to travel to Canada more frequently and on their own schedules. In 2015, a total of 1,231,041 multiple-entry visas were issued, which was a 21% increase from 2014. Effective February 6, 2014, a policy change automatically considered visitors to Canada eligible for a multiple-entry visa. IRCC also introduced a single fee for the processing of a temporary resident visa applicable to both single-entry and multiple-entry applications.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Canada gave 10-year unlimited stay duration with full work privileges (same thing as PR) to 1,231,041 3rd world non-white migrants.

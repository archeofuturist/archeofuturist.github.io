But at fukushima you have the waste pools sitting above the reactors, so those will keep feeding the reactions. Also it&#039;s right on the ocean, so containment going to be a bigger problem. It&#039;s pretty much been leaking material into the ocean this whole time non-stop. Additionally, a significant amount of the material was vaporized and released into the atmosphere. Mark my words, the increase in global cancer rates over the next 40 years will be higher than the increase after chernoble. I mean, it&#039;s gonna be difficult to estimate how much of that increase will be due to fukushima, and how much is caused by other factors.

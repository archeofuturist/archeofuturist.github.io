Just look at the traffic stats.<br><br>Reddit is also more of a liberal\/socialist\/social justice oriented site, especially when you consider the &quot;default&quot; subreddits (chosen and curated by management) and the site&#039;s history of thinly veiled censorship.<br><br>There is of course, r\/The_Donald, which has 350,000 subscribers, But Reddit actively, and collectively, keeps this subreddit from reaching the front page very often, and so redpilling of normies is rare. In addition, many subreddits like, r\/esist and r\/fuckthealtright, are campaigning to have The Donald banned for &quot;hate speech&quot; or &quot;spamming&quot; or whatever label they want to apply to their latest censorship brigade. When The Donald falls, or when its moderation becomes fully infiltrated and turned into controlled opposition, there will be no significant conservative voice on Reddit. <br><br>For a site that reaches so many people, Reddit is a powerful tool of social conditioning and it clearly serves the purposes of leftists everywhere.<br><br>In contrast, \/pol\/ has much fewer regular visitors, and the conversation here is much more inclusive of conservative views. Leftists and conservatives are free to argue here, but the reputation of this site keeps many of them from posting. This fact also separates us from The Donald, where it is against the rules (rule 6) to be Anti-Trump, and so such people are censored, which clearly does not happen on \/pol\/.<br><br>What can we do to promote more fair coverage of conservative political opinions and talking points on large websites like Reddit? Is our default counterpart the outnumbered and beleaguered The Donald? <br><br>Alternatively, what can we do to clean up the &quot;image&quot; of \/pol\/ so that it becomes more &quot;acceptable&quot; for people of all political stripes to visit?<br><br>I am NOT suggesting any brigades or raids, as these are obviously against the rules of both 4chan and Reddit.","filename":"Reddit","ext":".png","w":1280,"h":427,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":83,"tim":1490543112768,"time":1490543112,"md5":"DFcaAvca6kvNa+6EYMYYdA==","fsize":42469,"resto":0,"id":"uzYht1rt","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-reddit-situation","country_name":"United States","replies":34,"images":7,"unique_ips":26},{"no":118374684,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)11:48:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"Reddit has much more influence as it is filled with normies from all spectrums of gender, age and nationalities. \/pol\/ is kinda the place for a small percentage of edgy teenagers who think reddit is too mainstream for them.","time":1490543297,"resto":118374349,"id":"TRjiLeVD","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118375243,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)11:53:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"It&#039;s also worth pointing out that reddit has been accused of vote manipulation and messing with the Donald&#039;s subscriber count. <br><br>Likewise, the Donald subscribers are often highlighted by share blue and auto downvoted wherever they post.","time":1490543590,"resto":118374349,"id":"uzYht1rt","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118375961,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)11:59:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"He&#039;s right, guys!

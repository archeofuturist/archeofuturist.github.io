If you welfare leech in Nazi Germany you get fucked and there are no immigrants illegally coming over for gibs. Once again welfare in nazi germany was for the ones who needed a helping hand to get back into society. The veterans,widows,elderly etc, and you were unable to leech in this society.<br><br>Welfare is not the problem it is it&#039;s allocation and the current states worshipping of non whites. A all white nationalistic state could very well pull off a generous society.","time":1493426270,"resto":123259858,"id":"o0\/78K37","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":123271314,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)20:38:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"stop using this shitty ass compass goddamn.","time":1493426313,"resto":123259858,"id":"fzNNbr6D","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123271335,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)20:38:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123259858\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123259858<\/a><br>I was in the blue a couple across and a couple up.

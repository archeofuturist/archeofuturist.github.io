Many observers called it the most traumatic event in the history of a union whose origins date to the 1950s.

Bannon, who did not respond to interview requests, has repeatedly made clear his views about Europe. Most revealing is the widely read transcript of his Vatican talk, in which Bannon declared that \u201cthe world, and particularly the Judeo-Christian West, is in a crisis.\u201d Europe\u2019s citizens, he said, are restless for \u201csovereignty for their country, they want to see nationalism.\u201d And, Bannon added: \u201cThey don\u2019t believe in this kind of pan-European Union.\u201d<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Bannon has also expressed admiration for the reactionary French philosopher Charles Maurras, according to French media reports confirmed by Politico. Maurras, like Bannon, was a Catholic nationalist, and he argued in the early 1900s that the Enlightenment had elevated the individual over the nation. (One person who knows Bannon said he has spoken of the coming end of the Enlightenment.) To Maurras, a hero of the modern French right wing, the French Revolution ideals of \u201cliberty, equality and fraternity\u201d were a liberal cosmopolitan corruption of France\u2019s authentic identity. Bannon has approvingly cited Maurras\u2019 distinction between the \u201clegal country,\u201d led by elected officials, and the \u201creal country\u201d of ordinary people, as a frame for the populist revolt underway. Maurras even warned about the nefarious influence of Islam in Europe.<\/span><br><br>\/OURGUY\/","time":1490047882,"resto":117537858,"id":"8zdejcKu","country":"PT","country_name":"Portugal"},{"no":117538737,"now":"03\/20\/17(Mon)18:12:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117537858\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117537858<\/a><br>also, thanks for the relevant thread, portugal","filename":"relevant","ext":".png","w":587,"h":312,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":66,"tim":1490047958117,"time":1490047958,"md5":"lDHUctD3MmdrKiqiftf3wQ==","fsize":167459,"resto":117537858,"id":"71euKhrn","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":117538979,"now":"03\/20\/17(Mon)18:14:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117538737\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117538737<\/a><br>You&#039;re welcome based codfishbro.

Specifically on the nationalization of risk and the privatization of profit, where Wall Street executives could make risky investments because the taxpayer would pay for major losses (like the bailout). It also went on about the unsustainable debt and how it will come to a head eventually.<br><br>So why isn&#039;t Trump doing everything possible to lower the deficit. Upping spending on the military negates any cuts from other programs. And why did he choose Steven Mnuchin for Treasury Secretary, who was one of these predatory lenders responsible for the financial crisis (he even started a company with George Soros, SFM Capital Management)?<br><br> It seems like both of these decisions will do more to exacerbate the 4th Turning, and totally out of place from Bannon&#039;s ideology.

I don&#039;t hate women, and I&#039;m sure many French women share the views of Le Pen. But as you must know it was generally women, more so than men, who persecuted anyone who dared raise any questions about the sensibilities of accepting so many migrants, refugees, whatever. The irony, of course, is that it&#039;s now the women who have changed their mind after campaigning with such fervor and ridiculing with such venom. So of course now that the women have changed their minds, despite countless warnings and years of muslim problems in France, now we&#039;re permitted to acknowledge the problems. In this instance, and throughout France, my sympathies for women grows thin.","time":1492826905,"resto":122215942,"id":"x7y8jnW\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122220458,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)22:09:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122220275\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122220275<\/a><br>I meant throughout all of Europe","time":1492826975,"resto":122215942,"id":"x7y8jnW\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

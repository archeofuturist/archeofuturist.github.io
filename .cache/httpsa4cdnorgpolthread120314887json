Around it, the Aztecs created a large artificial island using a system similar to the creation of chinampas. To overcome the problems of drinking water, the Aztecs built a system of dams to separate the salty waters of the lake from the rain water of the effluents. It also permitted them to control the level of the lake. The city also had an inner system of channels that helped to control the water.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;During Cort\u00e9s&#039; siege of Tenochtitlan in 1521, the dams were destroyed, and never rebuilt, so flooding became a big problem for the new Mexico City built over Tenochtitlan.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mexico City suffered from periodic floods; in 1604 the lake flooded the city, with an even more severe flood following in 1607. Under the direction of Enrico Mart\u00ednez, a drain was built to control the level of the lake, but in 1629 another flood kept most of the city covered for five years. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Eventually the lake was drained by the channels and a tunnel to the P\u00e1nuco River, but even that could not stop floods, since by then most of the city was under the water table. The flooding could not be completely controlled until 1967, with the construction of a Deep Drainage System.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The ecological consequences of the draining were enormous. Parts of the valleys were turned semi-arid, and even today Mexico City suffers for lack of water. Due to overdrafting that is depleting the aquifer beneath the city, Mexico City is estimated to have dropped 10 meters in the last century. Furthermore, because soft lake sediments underlie most of Mexico City, the city has proven vulnerable to soil liquefaction during earthquakes, most notably in the 1985 earthquake when hundreds of buildings collapsed and thousands of lives were lost.<\/span>","filename":"Tenochtitlan-Mexico City","ext":".jpg","w":687,"h":715,"tn_w":120,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491767896162,"time":1491767896,"md5":"epk3ZaKxt0oYwr0nM\/0dpw==","fsize":247678,"resto":120314887,"id":"jWFOouwd","country":"MX","country_name":"Mexico"},{"no":120328591,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)16:06:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"even back then those guys were hated by all the other guys on the block. cortes was INVITED by the other mexican tribes to end those psychos. a bit like the kurds begging for airstrikes and speciul foces to get rid of ISIS","filename":"girl","ext":".png","w":168,"h":180,"tn_w":116,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491768405158,"time":1491768405,"md5":"0aJc0QEYKn0j9tnUZhVdJQ==","fsize":45503,"resto":120314887,"id":"x\/9RKyax","country":"AT","country_name":"Austria"},{"no":120328722,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)16:07:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120315203\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120315203<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Most of the Indians, particularly those living on the coasts and in the hotter climates, were given to unnatural lusts.

family had been in mexico since the 1600&#039;s. They were farmers who owned lands in Durango. We left right before 9\/11 just when the cartel shit was getting out of hand. There is no safety or security in mexico, you cant even defend yourself without the govt trying to send you to jail. Worse if you dont let the cartel or the cops get their way with you. <br><br>But let me tell you what the biggest problem is with Mexico; It&#039;s the Mexicans themselves. They are short, violent and stupid. You have something nice like a car or suit, they think you stole it from them somehow and will rob you for the sake of &#039;social justice&#039; that&#039;s what they literally call it when robbing people who have more or better stuff than them. And you must be prepared to defend your self and property with violence. Because that&#039;s the only thing they understand. They also resent america and americans greatly. They call the war and loss of territory the great injustice and think that maybe if california and texas were part of mexico they&#039;ed be rich like the americans are.<br><br> My grandpa used to be a hardass to his workers because he knew their nature intimately. When he died my aunt took over the business and showed them mercy and compassion and they raped her.<br><br>If you&#039;re nice to them they think you&#039;re weak and will abuse you, when you put your foot down they claim oppression. Worse if you&#039;re a 6 foot tall white man like myself. They will try to take you down and claim you destroyed their mythical aztec empire. I got in deep shit in university for disagreeing with the narrative that the spanish were evil.<br><br>I have no love for my place of birth, mexico can burn.

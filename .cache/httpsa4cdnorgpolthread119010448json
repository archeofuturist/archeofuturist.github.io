Public schools and universities used to provide the highest education. Completely opposite to the current situation where kids graduate without basic knowledge of maths, chemistry and science in general. Everything gets spoon fed and dumbed down in schools, few have better luck to attend expensive private schools. The government main purpose is to show statistics that indicate how the access to education has improved and has been democratized for all. The eternal struggle between quantity over quality, propaganda does wonders for them.","time":1490929295,"resto":119010448,"id":"XlhbcPzu","country":"VE","country_name":"Venezuela"},{"no":119010989,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)23:05:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119010448\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119010448<\/a><br>Is maduro trying to take sole power or is this what a much need CIA intervention?","time":1490929511,"resto":119010448,"id":"xQKdf\/M6","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119011047,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)23:05:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119010448\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119010448<\/a><br>Your fridge looks alright, you could use more meat but you&#039;re better than me, kek.","time":1490929543,"resto":119010448,"id":"XlhbcPzu","country":"VE","country_name":"Venezuela"},{"no":119011383,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)23:08:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119010989\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119010989<\/a><br>Stop taking the CIA bait, this is all done here (with cuban intervention ofc).

In all evils lies a blessed hope.<br>Think of it like this: God is capable of the best possible world. So, for Him to create any world but the best would be wrong, no?<br>But the best possible world is the one with the most good, yes? And the best possible good is the total glorification of God. But for God to receive this glory, He must demonstrate His attributes. But, some of His attributes, such as mercy and justice (which are a part of omnibenevolence), require evil to exist, for how could He forgive or punish if there were no evil things to punish and forgive?","time":1492614440,"resto":121838432,"id":"U6hGiduM","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121853734,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)11:09:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121852575\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121852575<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;His Omnipotence means power to do all that is intrinsically possible, not to do the intrinsically impossible.

God willingly doesnt interfere in our free will, as he wants us to be His children and be like him, not slaves and servants.

Evil is the diametric opposite of everything Gd embodies. Sure, He could probably make a person be jealous or angry, or do things they wouldn&#039;t normally, but it wouldn&#039;t be out of malice. Evil on the other hand, is fully capable of turning a person into a monster with casual ease. Making even the holiest and most righteous of men into monsters that would skullfuck their own families. This is specifically because it is everything God isn&#039;t.","time":1492616102,"resto":121838432,"id":"IdniJrb8","country":"JM","country_name":"Jamaica"},{"no":121856395,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)11:35:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121855961\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121855961<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;basis of western civilization<\/span><br><br>Mate just kill yourself fuckin hell<br><br>The only reason western civilization works is because of secular standards put into place to prevent christfags from ruining shit.

One of the Christian axioms, as stated above, is that God is more perfect than man; in other words, man is fundamentally not capable of fully understanding God, and therefore not capable of explaining why things are the way they are.<br><br>Another axiom: we have free will. We can choose to do things in accordance with what we think God wants, or we can chose to defy what we think God wants, or we can just sort of bumble along without thinking at all.<br><br>The consequence of these two axioms is that the outcome of the system, even if we assume God to be perfect, is going to contain things that we perceive as &quot;good&quot;, things that we perceive as &quot;evil&quot;, and things that are paradoxes -- things we can prove that we can&#039;t answer.<br><br>You might think that&#039;s dodging the question.

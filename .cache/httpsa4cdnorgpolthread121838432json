Evil is the diametric opposite of everything Gd embodies. Sure, He could probably make a person be jealous or angry, or do things they wouldn&#039;t normally, but it wouldn&#039;t be out of malice. Evil on the other hand, is fully capable of turning a person into a monster with casual ease. Making even the holiest and most righteous of men into monsters that would skullfuck their own families. This is specifically because it is everything God isn&#039;t.","time":1492616102,"resto":121838432,"id":"IdniJrb8","country":"JM","country_name":"Jamaica"},{"no":121856395,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)11:35:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121855961\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121855961<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;basis of western civilization<\/span><br><br>Mate just kill yourself fuckin hell<br><br>The only reason western civilization works is because of secular standards put into place to prevent christfags from ruining shit.

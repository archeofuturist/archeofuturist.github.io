Evil is the diametric opposite of everything Gd embodies. Sure, He could probably make a person be jealous or angry, or do things they wouldn&#039;t normally, but it wouldn&#039;t be out of malice. Evil on the other hand, is fully capable of turning a person into a monster with casual ease. Making even the holiest and most righteous of men into monsters that would skullfuck their own families. This is specifically because it is everything God isn&#039;t.","time":1492616102,"resto":121838432,"id":"IdniJrb8","country":"JM","country_name":"Jamaica"},{"no":121856395,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)11:35:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121855961\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121855961<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;basis of western civilization<\/span><br><br>Mate just kill yourself fuckin hell<br><br>The only reason western civilization works is because of secular standards put into place to prevent christfags from ruining shit.

Christ forgives your sins, but it&#039;s not a free license to sin without punishment. You wanna follow Yeshua the messiah of the jews you gotta be serious. God will forgive ALL your sins, but you&#039;re not supposed to keep sinning.

If something doesn&#039;t fulfill it&#039;s purpose it&#039;s bad, like a heart that doesn&#039;t pump blood.<br><br>Now, the purpose of sex in the Christian mind is twofold: procreation and an expression of love between a married couple. Sex done for these purposes is sex fulfilling its function.<br>With gays, even if they could get married, it can&#039;t result in procreation, and is thus not fulfilling its purpose. <br>With unmarried couples, though they could procreate, it isn&#039;t between a married couple, and thus not fulfilling its purpose.<br>With masturbation, its both not procreating and not between anyone, and thus not fulfilling it&#039;s purpose. In a sense, masturbation and gay sex are &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;equal&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot; as far as sins go, since they both can&#039;t result in procreation and aren&#039;t between a married couple.<br><br>So that&#039;s why the Church says no to gay sex and gay marriage. That said, the Church has nothing against gays as people, but forbids them from acting on their urges, just as it forbids me from masturbating or having sex outside of marriage.","time":1492619740,"resto":121838432,"id":"FmxrEwCT","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121862867,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)12:35:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121861780\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121861780<\/a><br>depends on by &quot;gay&quot; you mean<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;someone afflicted with same-sex attraction<\/span><br>or <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;someone who regularly fucks dudes in the ass\/gets fucked in the ass by dudes<\/span>","time":1492619744,"resto":121838432,"id":"x7AfAYbf","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121862964,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)12:36:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121862579\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121862579<\/a><br>its a good thing that gays aren&#039;t typically gay by their own free will then.","time":1492619795,"resto":121838432,"id":"R0JJEDKf","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121863011,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)12:36:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121862743\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121862743<\/a><br>Being jewish is equally bad and equally demiurgical.","time":1492619810,"resto":121838432,"id":"87WfRq0m","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":121863039,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)12:37:08","name":"Anonymous.","com":"<a href=\"#p121862721\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121862721<\/a><br>We never did any of that you retard.

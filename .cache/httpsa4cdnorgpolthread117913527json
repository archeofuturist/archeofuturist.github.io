One system is known as START (Simple Triage and Rapid Treatment). In START, victims are grouped into four categories, depending on the urgency of their need for evacuation. If necessary, START can be implemented by persons without a high level of training. The categories in START are:<br><br>the deceased, who are beyond help<br>the injured who could be helped by immediate transportation<br>the injured with less severe injuries whose transport can be delayed<br>those with minor injuries not requiring urgent care.<br>Another system that has been used in mass casualty situations is an example of advanced triage implemented by nurses or other skilled personnel. This advanced triage system involves a color-coding scheme using red, yellow, green, white, and black tags:<br><br>Red tags - (immediate) are used to label those who cannot survive without immediate treatment but who have a chance of survival.<br>Yellow tags - (observation) for those who require observation (and possible later re-triage). Their condition is stable for the moment and, they are not in immediate danger of death. These victims will still need hospital care and would be treated immediately under normal circumstances.<br>Green tags - (wait) are reserved for the &quot;walking wounded&quot; who will need medical care at some point, after more critical injuries have been treated.<br>White tags - (dismiss) are given to those with minor injuries for whom a doctor&#039;s care is not required.<br>Black tags - (expectant) are used for the deceased and for those whose injuries are so extensive that they will not be able to survive given the care that is available.","time":1490267215,"resto":117913527,"id":"LZdDUcge","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":117919345,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)07:06:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117919255\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117919255<\/a><br>And mummy May is licking the asshole of all the Islam praising.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;S-She&#039;ll be different and hard on the pakis though r-right?<\/span>","time":1490267218,"resto":117913527,"id":"gabQPe7f","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":117919347,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)07:06:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117918984\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117918984<\/a><br>It&#039;s the tobacco withdrawal that causes nausea.","time":1490267219,"resto":117913527,"id":"MM0lzhDg","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":117919371,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)07:07:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117917266\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117917266<\/a><br>The POOs will be genociding the slimes sooner than you think.","time":1490267244,"resto":117913527,"id":"yZU3liG\/","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":117919375,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)07:07:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"Theresa May is such a fucking wet flannel it isn&#039;t even funny anymore. <br><br>Brexit.

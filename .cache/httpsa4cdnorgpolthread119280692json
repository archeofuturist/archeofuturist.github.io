Myth: Women and men are already equal in Canada, so GBA+ is not needed.<\/span><br><br>While many advances have been made, equality gaps remain. Women in Canada today earn, on average, only 73.5 cents for every dollar that men earn. Women are also more often the victims of domestic and sexual violence and continue to be under-represented in leadership and executive positions, occupying only 10.3% of positions on corporate boards.<br><br>This is especially evident for certain groups of women. For example, women from northern and rural communities are more likely to experience poverty; Aboriginal women are far more likely to experience sexual and intimate partner violence; and immigrant women experience higher rates of unemployment.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;2. Myth: GBA+ only applies to women\u2019s issues \u2013 it is advocacy for women.<\/span><br><br>GBA+ is not advocacy for anyone. It is an analytical tool designed to help us ask questions, challenge assumptions, and to identify potential impacts, taking into account the diversity of Canadians. Once an issue has been analyzed using the GBA+ process, gender may emerge as the most important factor, while in other cases it might be culture, geography, or a combination of factors that may put a particular group at greater risk.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;3. Myth: GBA+ only applies to the \u201csocial\u201d sectors.<\/span><br><br>All government policies affect people. While gender and diversity issues may be more obvious in some areas (e.g. education and health) and less obvious in others (e.g. natural resources and defence) this does not necessarily mean that gender is not relevant. GBA+ can and has been used across social, economic, public safety and scientific sectors.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Notice how the government emphasizes factors other than gender.<\/span>","filename":"immigration ceremony","ext":".jpg","w":620,"h":416,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":83,"tim":1491188086081,"time":1491188086,"md5":"57FViOt8r8PgXNTRg3FZYA==","fsize":220303,"resto":119280692,"id":"+tpZfA3C","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119281780,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)22:55:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119281381\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119281381<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;left to suffer and\/or fend for ourselves.<\/span><br>relying on big government<br>ever","time":1491188107,"resto":119280692,"id":"eoYncZ0\/","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119281897,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)22:56:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119281780\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119281780<\/a><br>I know you can&#039;t rely on it... but we pay all that money into the system so that if the need is there we can!<br>But that&#039;s never the way it works.

A good number of American manufacturing companies, however, could benefit from this hit to their low-cost competitors.<\/span><br>https:\/\/www.axios.com\/scoop-trumps-<wbr>potentially-explosive-trade-play-23<wbr>52691437.html.","filename":"CT","ext":".png","w":346,"h":519,"tn_w":166,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491791768025,"time":1491791768,"md5":"o6\/nYvY105WCVtP4VCkb6A==","fsize":371109,"resto":0,"id":"iwFnHzs0","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"breaking-new-executive-order-incoming","country_name":"United States","replies":9,"images":2,"unique_ips":8},{"no":120379038,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)22:36:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Scope: This investigation could result in penalties that would be much broader than the anti-steel dumping measure the New York Times previewed last week.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Timing: Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross is running point on this executive order, and an administration source tells me it could arrive as early as late April. But there&#039;s no point getting too wedded to that timeline, because Trump has slowed the pace of executive actions and this is an especially sensitive one: If it&#039;s clumsy, foreign trading partners could see this as the first shot in a trade war.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What Ross says, through a spokesman: &quot;Trade negotiations and discussions should happen in the board room, not in the press room.&quot;<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The narrative: If this investigation leads to penalties on foreign trading partners, it will be a big (and much-needed) win for Steve Bannon, Stephen Miller, Peter Navarro, and other economic nationalists in Trump&#039;s orbit. Given the Syria strikes and Bannon&#039;s demotion from the NSC, their clout has appeared to diminish. The Goldman wing, meanwhile, will likely oppose aggressive trade moves.<\/span>","time":1491791813,"resto":120378948,"id":"iwFnHzs0","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120379058,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)22:37:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"Fucking zionist puppet am i rite guys?","time":1491791825,"resto":120378948,"id":"tFx9sxa+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120379093,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)22:37:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120378948\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120378948<\/a><br>HAHAHAHAH poor Xi.

It tells a lot about someone and often how well you can trust someone. A lot of sexual partners shows bad self control for a woman. The follow up question after asking how many is almost always how many of those guys were long term boyfriends since that can buy a few numbers without seeming too much like a whore. Honestly I think anything over 5 is too many for a woman, but it depends on the age of the girl too. Maybe 8? Most of my friends have 3-5 max before they found someone they married. <br><br>I slept with one boyfriend before I met my husband. Yeah I had sucked dicks and fooled around in my dating years and was not a prude, but if a woman does not guard herself a little bit when it comes to full on fucking then she is pretty much a whore. <br><br>I have one friend that lives free and screws guys all the time, she is now 34 and still single and really unhappy even though she claims to love her modern legs open sexual freedom.","time":1491296602,"resto":119449507,"id":"M6Rjy0Be","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119450811,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)05:07:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"also the forum is &quot;mumsnet&quot; a site for parents, so this whore already has a kid(s) yet has fucked so many guys she feels shame telling this poor guy.

It tells a lot about someone and often how well you can trust someone. A lot of sexual partners shows bad self control for a woman. The follow up question after asking how many is almost always how many of those guys were long term boyfriends since that can buy a few numbers without seeming too much like a whore.

That might sound a lot to you (or not) but when you think that&#039;s over 14 years it suddenly doesn&#039;t mean a whole lot.

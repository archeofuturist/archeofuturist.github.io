S. District Judge David J. Hale of the Western District of Kentucky also wrote in an opinion and order released Friday that because violence had broken out at a prior Trump rally and that known hate group members were in the Louisville crowd, Trump&#039;s ordering the removal of an African-American woman was &quot;particularly reckless.&quot;<br><br>Citing case law from tumultuous 1960s race riots and other student protests, Hale rejected motions to dismiss the pending complaint against Trump and three supporters in the crowd that was filed by three protesters after a March 1, 2016, campaign rally in Louisville. Only a portion of the defendants&#039; motion was granted, but the decision means that the bulk of the claims will proceed.<br><br>The protesters, Henry Brousseau, Kashiya Nwanguma and Molly Shah, are seeking unspecified monetary damages. They claim they were assaulted by audience members who were riled up by Trump. Besides Trump, the lawsuit names three defendants in attendance \u2014 Matthew Heimbach, a leader with the white supremacist group Traditional Youth Network from Paoli, Ind.; Alvin Bamberger, a member of the Korean War Veterans Association from Ohio; and an unknown individual.","filename":"MatthewHeimbach","ext":".jpg","w":512,"h":512,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491698575924,"time":1491698575,"md5":"GMEV+iuSSy86J\/LOQuT3Hw==","fsize":32796,"resto":0,"id":"hZY4GrAb","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"this-is-the-face-of-white-nationalism-in-2017","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

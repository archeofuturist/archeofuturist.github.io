Their threat will only grow.<br><br>They are working on miniaturizing their nukes. I think the biggest fear is they sell a small nuclear weapon to some insane terrorist groul who uses it in a major US city. I bet Trump is facing scenarios from strategists.<br><br>The best goal is they normalize from leaked K-pop, the USSR and China got less ridiculous from information flow. KJU had to do a purge of closet normies when he took power. <br><br>If we wait, their ICBM capacity and ability to sell a nuke to ISIS tier refugees grow, but there is mlre chance of a normie coup or unbearable unrest.<br><br>My gut is that wont happen. Koreans are too intense, their culture too locked down and nationalistic, if a general gets red pilled KJU can smell it, kill him, and promote a peasant.<br><br>I think there will be war. Its too dangerous to let their nuclear capacity grow, let alone having them nuclear arm a terror proxy group to strike us.","filename":"1492125379724","ext":".png","w":499,"h":662,"tn_w":188,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492147671449,"time":1492147671,"md5":"1CBPHHmroljEr4VZjh3P6Q==","fsize":219866,"resto":0,"id":"kxGX8nj6","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"how-much-of-a-threat-is-nk","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":1,"unique_ips":2},{"no":121024808,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)01:40:19","name":"Anonymous","filename":"1491768151934","ext":".png","w":592,"h":302,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":63,"tim":1492148419016,"time":1492148419,"md5":"4yajspy\/Z9Y+RXzo4Nx\/2g==","fsize":311322,"resto":121023700,"id":"KmAoV3Wo","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

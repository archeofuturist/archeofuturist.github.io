Exxon\u2019s former CEO Rex Tillerson is now US secretary of state.<br>The Journal reported on the application Wednesday afternoon, citing \u201cpeople familiar with the matter,\u201d who remain anonymous. The Treasury Department told the paper that it did not comment on waiver applications, while Exxon said it would not discuss government deliberations.<br><br>It is unclear whether Exxon filed the claim with the Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control before Tillerson was appointed secretary of state by President Donald Trump, the WSJ said.<br><br>Tillerson has recused himself from any matters involving Exxon for two years, and will not be involved in any decisions by the US government involving the company during that period, the paper reported, citing a State Department spokesman.<br><br>Trump\u2019s critics pounced on the report as proof of their allegations about the president\u2019s improper financial ties with Russia.<br><br>In 2012, Tillerson negotiated a deal with Russia\u2019s oil and gas giant Rosneft worth as much as $500 billion in joint investments, to explore deposits in the Black Sea, the Arctic and Russia\u2019s Far East. Much of the deal was put on ice by the sanctions imposed by the Obama administration in 2014, after Crimea voted to rejoin Russia following a violent coup by US-backed political forces in Ukraine.<br><br>According to the Wall Street Journal, Exxon is asking for a sanctions waiver because its exploration rights in the Black Sea will soon expire if the company does not act.<br><br>Some of its European competitors already have sanctions waivers.

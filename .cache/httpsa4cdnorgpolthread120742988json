There is really no hope now of a political solution to this country&#039;s ills. The democracy is broken. Its one party with two factions, leftist and more leftist. Trump did us the favor of revealing how much the party lied about their intentions all along.on every issue. When given complete power, they cower away from all the outrages they claim to have had about liberal agendas and head for the hills.<br><br>Trump says we aren&#039;t going into Syria.<br><br>He also said he was going to stay out of the mid-east. He said he was locking up Hillary He said there would be a muslim ban. He said he was repealing Obama care. He vouched for Flynn and said he believed torture worked.<br><br>He says a lot of things that he reverses a day later so any fucking thing at all that comes out of his mouth is meaningless gibberish. He lies constantly so theres no reason to believe anything he says at all. Im pretty certain he is being revealed as a sociopath, because its unnatural to lie with such abandon and expect a relationship with the people to continue when its obvious you are lying.<br><br>And then this bit with &#039;pics&#039; of dead kids being the reason he bombs Syria.

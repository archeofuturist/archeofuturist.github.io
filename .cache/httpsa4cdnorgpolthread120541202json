Even Fox News was sucking Trump&#039;s dick. There&#039;s your proof that you can&#039;t trust them either.<br><br>So if you can&#039;t trust the right-wing source, and you can&#039;t trust the left-wing source, then what do you do? YOU READ ALL OF THEM.<br><br>I can&#039;t tell you how many times I&#039;ve said something on here and you guys haven&#039;t any fucking clue what I&#039;m talking about because your news source is limited to like one place, or maybe even just \/pol\/ itself. It&#039;s really pathetic. We need MORE people browsing MORE news.<br><br>Use your eyes, use your brains. If Trump is really turned into a neocon jew by his kids then you aren&#039;t going to learn that on Fox. They were already hiding the fact that the air strike was practically worthless.

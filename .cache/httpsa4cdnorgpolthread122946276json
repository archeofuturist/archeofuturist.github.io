Students need authentic mentors. The hiring of Alice Goffman has already, and will continue to discourage students of color, and especially women of color, from entering the Sociology Department and academia for years to come.\u201d<br>The letter also criticized \u201cthe flawed process\u201d of hiring Ms. Goffman and called for a peer-appointed student committee to be \u201cat the forefront of all current and future hiring decisions,\u201d the Independent reported.<br>Despite the backlash, Ms. Goffman has accepted the offer to be a visiting professor of sociology, and the college said it\u2019s happy with the decision.&quot;<br><br>Well white man, is this what is has come to? Whites just getting hired brings out protestors? How fucking KEKED can you get, white man? When will you fix your society?<br><br>This college in in southern cali, it&#039;s private so it likely isn&#039;t because whites are a minority, this is just white on white antagonism.

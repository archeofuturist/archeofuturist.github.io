And classy, when a child gets an unexpected sickness it is the parents fault, not the fact that shit happens. Im not talking about sickness you get from being irresponsible you mongrel, only things you cannot predict. According to \/pol\/ those people can go fuck themselves because they got less lucky. You need to make up your mind if you a part of society and take responsibility from being lucky enough to belong to it and take benefits from it or are going to wail because you feel like a dying kid didnt deserve part of your money,.and in the end you are responsible for yourself. Most people on this board dont seem to have any problems in shifting to sides when they feel like it profits them. Say &#039;oh but if something bad happens to you it is your fault&#039;, but that is not how world works. The fact that they are easy to shit on people that have children and bear consequences from it, all while crying about crap like &#039;why whites dont have more children?&#039;, is ridiculous.

Mostly because you start from the point of saying that politicians should make an appeal to god and the soul. It&#039;s a curious statement for two reasons. The first being that an appeal to these parties can only include the populous as a third person. In this case an appeal to god would be a person praying to get elected ratger than campaigning. Perhaps you instead meant; &quot;Use the appeal of the soul and the ethics of god to collect support from the masses.&quot; This brings me to the second point. You have to argue that these things are valid first, then work out their exact nature in order to construct a proposition that relates to them. What is the nature of a soul? What would a spiritual appeal entail? If your question is about why these aren&#039;t done as much, then the answer is simple. In additon to being nebulous, these ideas are not popular. Popularity gets politicians elected. So it makes no sense for them to campaign on an unpopular platform. Monarchy in specific is highly unpopular in the United States. I would, however like to hear some of your arguments in favor of monarchy and also your explaination of the nature of the soul and what it means to campaign according to god and the soul. Additionally I&#039;d also like you to explain the reasoning behind this derrived nature and how you uncovered or learned of it. In that you&#039;ll probably find your answer.","filename":"1489954988806","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":847,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":82,"tim":1493255543807,"time":1493255543,"md5":"g1mUPRrnRTeiXbqlL54\/dw==","fsize":266274,"resto":122969567,"id":"purEhAi\/","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":122971700,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)21:18:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122970973\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122970973<\/a><br>I agree that there is some fundamental framework missing from this discussion, namely the definitions of some of these terms such as God, soul, ect. <br><br>Moving onto why I would support a monarchy. Provided the monarch had the interests of his people in mind, I believe that it is a vastly superior system. The masses are too easily swayed by propaganda and concern themselves with very trivial matters. The fact is that anybody who has risen to the top of any social hierarchy deserves to be there, usually. Essentially, the people are unfit to govern themselves. <br><br>Now that this unfitness has been established, a Monarch does not need to appeal to the foolish, vapid demands of the people. He may, instead, appeal to God, and what he, as the superior human, believes is right or wrong.","time":1493255904,"resto":122969567,"id":"Rxkc5JXI","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122972534,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)21:25:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"C&#039;mon faggots get in here<br><br>... or else I will masquerade as a leaf and post bait threads","filename":"brugge cozy mideval city","ext":".jpg","w":1778,"h":1200,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":84,"tim":1493256303783,"time":1493256303,"md5":"W5Zmmvhbv1mG\/OlvAWzhZg==","fsize":207207,"resto":122969567,"id":"Rxkc5JXI","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"}]}

Maybe you&#039;re a graphic designer and you cringe when people just say Adobe when they mean Acrobat. Maybe you&#039;re a chef and it&#039;s painful to listen to people give each other completely wrongheaded cooking advice. Maybe you&#039;ve been in the armed services, and it grates your nerves to hear doughy weekend warriors talk about military tactics with no education beyond Google and some History channel documentaries.<br><br>Well I&#039;ve been in dom rel \/ family law for years. And it&#039;s my own personal cross of frustration to traverse the internet and watch people giving each other TERRIBLE advice about custody cases, spousal support &amp; alimony, restraining orders, etc...<br><br>So to crib a plebbit term, I wanted to experiment with a quick AMA. Nothing I say constitutes legal advice, and you should understand that family law has many similarities but also many differences between states and jurisdictions. Quality and substantive answers should always be sought in a consultation with an attorney hired to protect your interests. BUT feel free to shoot if you have questions about the generalities of divorce, custody, domestic abuse, or whatever. <br><br>Example:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What happens to pets in divorce?<\/span><br>Many states consider pets part of a simple property division. I know that sounds fucked up to anyone who cares deeply about their pets, but remember that most people navigating this shit have actual kids, and they just view their pets as something for the kids anyway. <br><br>Again. Not legal advice.","filename":"ChildUsesVoodooToBreakUpParents","ext":".jpg","w":450,"h":327,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":181,"tim":1492484144029,"time":1492484144,"md5":"LbKTYRmon4iWvmCc2ZxGTg==","fsize":32829,"resto":0,"id":"H\/xzZ5sD","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"you-know-how-frustrating-it-is-to-hear-neophytes","country_name":"United States","replies":4,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":121627448,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)22:58:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"what&#039;s the worst you&#039;ve seen a guy get screwed by the courts? did he set himself up for it, or was it the court looking out for itself in terms of the cut of money the courts get for &quot;managing&quot; child\/spousal support?","time":1492484308,"resto":121627123,"id":"nnzW7qTI","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121628361,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)23:05:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"fuck your shitty thread and your shitty opinions you worthless paralegal","time":1492484750,"resto":121627123,"id":"x+YQ2z8g","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121628646,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)23:08:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121627448\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121627448<\/a><br>The days of the deck being entirely stacked against men by default are largely behind us. The issue now is that it&#039;s still WAY more frequent for men to be the breadwinner, so it&#039;s still more frequent for men to pay alimony. And since they didn&#039;t spend as much time with the kids (because of pursuing their career, or because they just don&#039;t want to be a parent) they don&#039;t get as much parenting time after the divorce. <br><br>But the system now acknowledges difference. There are plenty of cases where the wife is a doctor or other high-paying professional that allows the dad to stay home through the kids&#039; early years. And when that happens, you see fathers getting custody, the lion&#039;s share of parenting time, and commensurate support payments. <br><br>I&#039;m gonna be honest thought. Men are just more likely to fuck up their own cases. They assume that the courts are out to get them and lash out like cornered animals, demonstrating all kinds of bad behavior that hurt them in the long run. If dudes would just calm down and take their lawyers&#039; advice, they could benefit from how legal norms have shifted. <br><br>But your question was &quot;what&#039;s the worst you&#039;ve seen?&quot; That&#039;s a unique set of circumstances where the judge just fucking HATED the dad. If you&#039;re in a jurisdiction that believes in retained judges for each court appearance (or a small rural circuit with a small pool of judges), you best walk on fucking eggshells every hearing and appearance. <br><br><br>Not legal advice.","time":1492484899,"resto":121627123,"id":"H\/xzZ5sD","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121629139,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)23:12:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121628361\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121628361<\/a><br>I&#039;m sorry for your full diaper.

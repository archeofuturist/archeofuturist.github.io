The only explanation that they can see for the odd things in their bedrooms is that their wives are having affairs with men who utilize them in their day to day professions. The last man says he thinks his wife is fucking a horse because he found a jockey under his bed. The line of thinking being that the horse left the jockey there after he had sex with the wife. Now I can get how this can be confusing to a Swed. You see in most of the world (unlike Sweden) men don&#039;t like other men having sex with their wives. Usually if they discover another man having sex with their wives they harm said man physically. This leads to situations where the adulterer will hide from the scorned man if he should arrive while he was engaging in sex with his wife. In the case of the joke the jockey was having sex with the man&#039;s wife and hide as unlike Sweden he would not be met with praise for adultery.","time":1492471033,"resto":121597875,"id":"9+l2EX70","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121600165,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)19:20:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121599772\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121599772<\/a><br><br>thanks m8","time":1492471207,"resto":121597875,"id":"ZzmaP05T","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":121600492,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)19:22:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121600165\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121600165<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;gets insulted<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;says thanks<\/span><br><br>the gift that keeps on giving","time":1492471370,"resto":121597875,"id":"wuOG8Gfn","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121600726,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)19:24:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"THEY ARE JUST LIKE REAL PEOPLE","time":1492471471,"resto":121597875,"id":"PVhJ2+xN","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":121600749,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)19:24:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121597875\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121597875<\/a><br>Because the leader and followers of the country are threatening a non-hostile region of the world.<br><br>If you stand around in a bar waving a gun claiming you&#039;re going to shoot someone in the face at any given moment because you&#039;re a gangster and someone blows your fucking face off, I don&#039;t think anyone is going to have pity for you... <br><br>\/thread","time":1492471481,"resto":121597875,"id":"F6qVbRxY","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121600837,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)19:25:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121600726\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121600726<\/a><br>My God!

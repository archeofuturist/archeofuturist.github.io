If they weren&#039;t the west would have been under total commie control. Yet they control banking and old media system through the non-orthodox jew&#039;s families, have a massive leverage over any western politician, a firm grasp on the juridicial system via academic influence, and own a good percentage of top 200 international corporations.<br><br>Yet, in spite of all that: the 2015 mass immigration crisis spiralled out of control, probably due to slavers greed and whatnot, or probably due to the chance of quickly gaining politcal influence in the west by Turkey and Saudi&#039;s. But I&#039;m ready to bet that both the commies in Bruxelles and those in NY would have preferred to keep them coming in silence since it gave birth to a world-wide counter movement: a bunch of conspiracy theorists, and some guys from their computers, gained mass approval and red-pilling momentum; dismantling a gigantic, billionarie media narrative. <br><br>And the internet is still free.<br>Who are the allies of the western sovereign nation? What are the factions of the globalist\/communists and their allies? Who&#039;s fighting this war for the future of the west and the east?","filename":"1508","ext":".jpg","w":461,"h":300,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":162,"tim":1493722260687,"time":1493722260,"md5":"6EhSLewcPxYJ120UlOEY+g==","fsize":55472,"resto":0,"id":"ecfGM4vk","country":"IT","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"globalist-factions","country_name":"Italy","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

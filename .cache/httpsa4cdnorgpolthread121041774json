There will be an unprecedented move of God in the last days.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;2. God is going to use &quot;the nobodies&quot; during this great wave of the Spirit that is coming.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;3. There will be a great anointing on those that are ready to receive it.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;4. Some will refuse the anointing of God and the call of God.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;5. This move of God will happen in &quot;Africa, England, Russia, China, America&quot; and &quot;all over the world.&quot;<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;6. There will be great signs, wonders, healings and miracles.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;7. Hicks was told by Jesus that this is the &quot;mighty army&quot; that will arise in &quot;the last days.&quot;<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;8. Spiritual &quot;translation&quot; will become common for those in this army.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;9. There will be great famine in the last days. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;10. There will be a tremendous harvest of souls as multitudes come to know Jesus.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;11. &quot;God is going to give to the world a demonstration in this last hour as the world has never known.&quot;<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;12. The true body of Christ will finally function as it was originally intended.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;13. A time of &quot;great persecution&quot; will strike as this mighty army is winning souls all over the world.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;14. Great vials of God&#039;s wrath being poured out upon the face of the earth just after the rapture takes place. <\/span><br><br>It may seem strange and a phenomenon, but that is the beginning of these end-time ministries. God is going to take the do-nothings, the nobodies, the unheard-of, the no-accounts. He is going to take every man and every woman, and he is going to give to them this outpouring of the Spirit of God.","filename":"download","ext":".jpg","w":168,"h":168,"tn_w":168,"tn_h":168,"tim":1492162709195,"time":1492162709,"md5":"Pjqpvsz6OAWpF9Qv1UKjrQ==","fsize":6453,"resto":0,"id":"hbxxV9Wx","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"uhh-guys-is-this-us","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

When Trump was running he argued the unemployment rate was 25%, now he&#039;s saying the stats are right and its at 4%, did he lower it THAT much in 100 days? No. Truth is Trump is a complete moron that doesn&#039;t understand economics, thinks the FED needs to recall it&#039;s loans, and thinks that tax-n-spending is bad for the economy. He is a RIGHT WING RETARD and is going to ruin the perfect economy that Obama gave us.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;pic related is an example of a real President<\/span><br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=bTZ<wbr>GU9s0idM","filename":"Bill Clinton","ext":".jpg","w":1224,"h":792,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":161,"tim":1493236888677,"time":1493236888,"md5":"58B\/SvMaD9uRWQZ4VDvuPw==","fsize":248302,"resto":0,"id":"E9n7D+5J","country":"CA","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"right-wing-retards-think-trump-is-doing-a-good","country_name":"Canada","replies":24,"images":7,"unique_ips":13},{"no":122931208,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)16:05:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122930583\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122930583<\/a><br>Wow rude ;(<br>Use nice words please :) \/pol\/ is a nice place for nice people","time":1493237143,"resto":122930583,"id":"R4hHGgNV","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122931353,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)16:06:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122931208\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122931208<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Right wing retards don&#039;t like being triggered<\/span><br>LOL!

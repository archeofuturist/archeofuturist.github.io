What products can we envision utilizing Smartdust?<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Impact of employment can be discussed here. What happens to people in an age of Smartdust? What happens to labor rights? Why, if you think it could be a transition that harms existing models, will there be winners and losers in the employment markets?<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Investment opportunities can be speculated on in this thread. Please note, the sensitive nature of Smartdust in the economics of a nation, and the existing surveillance models suggest there is wisdom in avoiding insider trading charges.

If so then the Johnny depp movie where he is a computer AI might be hints of greater plans for smartdust.

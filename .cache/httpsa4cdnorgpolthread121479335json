One was a far left socialist and the other was a libertarian and I was the token far right guy. We got drunk and talked politics. Socialist dominated talk time 70% of the time, Libertarian 20% and me 10%. Libertarian dude was getting frustrated because he couldn&#039;t say anything and snapped and called the socialist everything wrong with society and said I may be a far right borderline Nazi but at least I am willing to have a fair discussion. That&#039;s the right vs left dynamic today. You can see in that pic the conservative smiling joking about the situation and the cold hearted cunt liberal hates him because he has a different opinion.","time":1492404146,"resto":121479335,"id":"TJe\/wJaS","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

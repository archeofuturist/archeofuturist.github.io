They have no extradition treaty with the U.S. If there were actually evidence of Trump collusion with the Russians, you can bet your sweet ass it would have been brought out before his inauguration.

There were Clinton campaign insiders saying she was planning multiple strikes on Russian airfields to cripple their air force before taking unilateral action in Syria. Those same leaders said her military advisors were telling her it wasn&#039;t possible, but she was insisting the plan would work. Considering it was leaked and that Russian intelligence had to know what she planned, it likely would have been step one in starting WWIII.

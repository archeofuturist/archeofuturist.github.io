A portion of the userbase went to 8pol and a large portion stayed here. But here&#039;s the thing, the group that left were the serious ones, also very much into internet activism. A lot of the shit in the media that gets blamed on 4chan is actually them. It&#039;s also a really good place to visit once a day for news, because they dig deep and do not tolerate faggy roleplaying. But being so serious all the time, they&#039;re a bunch of no-fun paranoid faggots and will not hesitate to ban shitposters.<br><br>4chan is a much faster board, but it&#039;s composed mostly of shitposters, LARPers, trolls and shills. It&#039;s hard to find an actual good thread without having to read the most garbage posts from people who have no fucking clue what they&#039;re talking about, but feel the need to post anyway. But it&#039;s also a more fun board to post in, it&#039;s like hanging out with a bunch of dudes and laughing. <br><br>I wish both boards would be unified again, because that&#039;s when \/pol\/ was truly great.","time":1491976237,"resto":120720236,"id":"ufjhSzsr","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120721416,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)01:53:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120721216\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120721216<\/a><br>Best post.

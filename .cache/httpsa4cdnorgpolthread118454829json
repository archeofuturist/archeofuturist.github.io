But It is more efficient to create goods and services that other people in the surroundings don&#039;t have. Since chopping trees to burn them in winter does not give any value to our neighbors who can actually use electricity or pellets or even coal to have heating, you would be actually chopping trees to have a subsistence economy which is inefficient.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Being said this, the question is, how do we create a society that provides value to our neighbors, so we can then buy stuff from them? <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;This lead us to the fact that we have to recruit people who have the creativity and the skills to create such value. So we need, seed capital to start the settlement. This means enough money to create the infrastructure that will be used by \/OurPeople\/ to create value. The challenge is how to attract this capital, therefore I believe we have to create a business oportunity for \/OurPeople\/ and our investors. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;BTW... this is how the USA were started in the first place, investors from France and Britain put the money so they could buy whatever they needed to create a civilization. The same happened when Christopher Columbus asked the Catholic Monarchs for the resources to start his expedition.<\/span>","filename":"1489709144956","ext":".jpg","w":1778,"h":1007,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1490581525426,"time":1490581525,"md5":"QVMTzI9M+uKe9qXaJ0OWyA==","fsize":338684,"resto":118454829,"id":"scx7953j","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":118459360,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)22:37:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118457399\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118457399<\/a><br>The forum is in its early stages, but this is the most serious attempt to create kekistan.","time":1490582272,"resto":118454829,"id":"Y9pveRFy","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118460076,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)22:44:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118459360\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118459360<\/a><br>yeah","time":1490582674,"resto":118454829,"id":"dWi7fctp","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"}]}

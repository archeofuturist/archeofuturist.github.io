Aren&#039;t the attacks just damaging their cause by fueling nationalist sentiments? It seems like the smartest thing to do, from their point of view, would be to just let the muslims breed in the west and then conduct an outright series of civil wars. Are terrorists just inbred retards who are tunnel visioned on providing short term bursts of violence against the infidels or is there a strategic component to the terrorist attacks that I just don&#039;t see?","filename":"what","ext":".jpg","w":841,"h":794,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":236,"tim":1490622122894,"time":1490622122,"md5":"rBju4tx8fMFVEUPW+OPe8g==","fsize":48493,"resto":0,"id":"E1OkaBaT","country":"PL","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"why-does-isis-organize-terrorist-attacks-in-the","country_name":"Poland","replies":16,"images":1,"unique_ips":14},{"no":118513687,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)09:44:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;inbred Arabs<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;strategically competent<\/span>","time":1490622272,"resto":118513461,"id":"I7HR9OO+","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":118513932,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)09:47:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"Their goal is to fuel nationalist sentiments, creating more and more tensions between muslims and native populations, inevitably driving muslims into ISIS&#039; hand.","time":1490622457,"resto":118513461,"id":"0NeAQJtS","country":"BE","country_name":"Belgium"},{"no":118513996,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)09:48:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118513461\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118513461<\/a><br>Because they really hate us.

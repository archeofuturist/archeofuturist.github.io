Saudi Arabia has always been vehemently against Arab nationalism, also called Arab Baathism among many names. The battle for the Middle East is not everyone vs. Israel. It is US\/Israel with Arabia as the one who will assume power vs. Iran\/Hezbollah\/Syria\/Russia, with Iran taking power if it wins. Enough with the Greater Israel Plan, that idea never made any sense because if they did that, Jews would become a minority in the Middle East. What will happen instead is the Greater Arabia Plan. The Saudis dislike Arab nationalism, they dislike the idea of the arab race working together, whether they are Moslem, Christian, Druze or other. <br><br>So what did the Saudis do? They founded radical Islam. They pushed Wahhabism and convinced some Sunnis that all Christians\/Shia\/Jews deserve immediate death by radicalizing the holy text. The vast majority of muslims are not Wahhabi radicals, in fact muslims are the ones being killed the most by ISIS and other groups. This sparks mass immigration into Europe, Arabia takes exactly 0 refugees, and destabilizes the region. They don&#039;t want christians and muslims working together, despite the fact that Eesa (Jesus) is a holy prophet in the Koran, and Mary is mentioned more than in the New Testament. When you see muslims saying &quot;screw jesus etc.&quot; they&#039;re retards who aren&#039;t even muslim. Christianity and Islam are almost the same religion at their core. Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Moses are in there as well. The koran even says Christians and Muslims will fight as brothers with Christ in the end times for God&#039;s sake. <br><br><br>The Saudis created radical islam out of thin air with the help of Israel. They&#039;ve destabilized the region, pushed 60million Christians out of the Middle East over the decades and abroad, and millions of Muslims now as well. Yes, I know the Jews run the USA, I am not saying there isn&#039;t a jewish conspiracy, there is. But the Middle East is Arabia&#039;s game, you&#039;re looking at the wrong enemy. &lt;c&gt;","filename":"1492755619325","ext":".png","w":1197,"h":1196,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":249,"tim":1492978117377,"time":1492978117,"md5":"ZIRXEm3BrXj1FIStzl+JgA==","fsize":2156351,"resto":0,"id":"+8l3wF53","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"take-the-saudi-pill-you-autists-saudi-arabia-has","country_name":"United States","replies":3,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":122479009,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)16:12:29","name":"Some Arab","com":"You guys like to point at the fact that the Jews run the media, you are partly correct. But who is the largest shareholder of Murdoch (Fox News, many others) aside from Murdoch himself? The royal fucking family of Saudi Arabia. They keep pushing the discussion to liberal bullshit, globalism, and yes, anti-semitism. Don&#039;t you idiots think that if the Jews were really in total charge of everything on Earth, they would even allow such discussion to take place? These Saudi dogs have moved the topic of the conversation to Euro-nationalism, immigration, Christians v. Muslims (even though they SHOULD be brothers) and hatred of Jews. They keep you morons tied to insane conspiracy theories about the Arab East and some retarded jewish revenge scheme that makes no sense, when in reality the enemy is sitting there quietly right in front of your face. You guys should know that if your ideas begin to become popular, you know that it is only because whoever is in charge is fine with it. Jews would not be the topic of conversation on the news so often in Europe\/America if they were in charge.","time":1492978349,"resto":122478350,"id":"+8l3wF53","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122479048,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)16:12:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"God look at that disgusting hair, no wonder they get weaves, I can&#039;t blame them.","time":1492978365,"resto":122478350,"id":"GC5zpc0c","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122479377,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)16:14:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"nice redpills, bump","time":1492978489,"resto":122478350,"id":"fbAQNLlR","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

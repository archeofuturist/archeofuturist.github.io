Its not just &quot;memes&quot; or &quot;banter&quot;, its vicious attacking and regardless of intentions it does demean people and hurt feelings. I can&#039;t say I&#039;m the only diaspora man who finds it hard to take pride in his own country after having years of constant and needless attacks defaming my heritage from insecure losers here. Why not bully Amerifats or Swedecucks? Do they not have much more to be ashamed of than the peaceful countries we live in and countries we&#039;re originally from? The Turkroaches get bullied less than us and yet we are the purest whites in Europe.<br><br>Like when its not just banter, when a meme is repeated over and over again, repeated systematically, it eventually becomes a truth irregardless of the intentions in repeating it. And that isn&#039;t just jokes any more then, then its harmful !<br>Would you call a European diaspora man a &quot;dijaspora scum&quot; to his face? Would you say to a kind, peaceful and hard working salt of the earth diaspora man that they are &quot;diaspora chimps&quot;? Would you say those words to your fellow white brother? Are you starting to feel ashamed now? You fucking degenerate?<br>You&#039;re destroying national pride, you&#039;re dividing whites against each other, you&#039;re doing the opposite of what you claim to support when you engage in this incredibly abhorrent behavior. So I encourage you to stop now.","filename":"diaspora","ext":".jpg","w":1143,"h":471,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":103,"tim":1492202801049,"time":1492202801,"md5":"uKa7HD7rU7Sh4wO4rmzbhQ==","fsize":119766,"resto":0,"id":"ngxedI3G","country":"CH","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"seriously-the-bullying-against-disaspora-members","country_name":"Switzerland","replies":83,"images":5,"unique_ips":30},{"no":121111767,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)16:51:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121110977\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121110977<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;national pride<\/span><br>why did you leave then<br>saged","time":1492203105,"resto":121110977,"id":"Nu87B0Zd","country":"RS","country_name":"Serbia"},{"no":121111834,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)16:52:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121110977\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121110977<\/a><br>I for one welcome our based Slavic, Christian diaspora members of our community.","time":1492203130,"resto":121110977,"id":"\/nKhpUd\/","country":"CH","country_name":"Switzerland"},{"no":121111983,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)16:53:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121111834\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121111834<\/a><br>Enjoy your Albos.","time":1492203201,"resto":121110977,"id":"eN7bxFaA","country":"GR","country_name":"Greece"},{"no":121112030,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)16:53:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121111767\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121111767<\/a><br>My parents left.

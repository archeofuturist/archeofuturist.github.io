I&#039;d never touch a sheboon but this woman I&#039;d gladly make an exception for. She is cultured, intelligent and articulate. She&#039;s passionate about her work, something you don&#039;t see too often among blacks.<br><br>Everything about her drove my teenage cock insane. Perfect smile, flawless features, impressive rack, beautiful eyes. She had a voice made of silk and she always smelt great like cinnamon and lavender. No negro stank on this fine specimen.<br><br>Wonderful upstanding woman. She was like a sister to my mother, consoling her during a turbulent divorce and death in the family. I remember when my uncle died she would cook meals and just sit with us. She came to my high school graduation, even donated money towards my college fund. She&#039;s an honorary aunt I want to bang.<br><br>She sent me a Christmas card last year. She&#039;s 55 going on 18 but now she&#039;s saddled with two mulatto kids. I&#039;m just glad her husband is a pretty cool dude, he works in aeronautics.<br><br>But yeah OP, aside from her I haven&#039;t met many &#039;successful&#039; darkies. Where I live every nigger is a lifer in the army. Nothing wrong with making a career out of the military. Sure as fuck beats slinging dope on the streets and robbing liquor stores.","filename":"81499cfe3246ac61bbb7011910286378","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":595,"tn_w":105,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492535724493,"time":1492535724,"md5":"a0PG1PE67zQOj35XuHKebw==","fsize":61541,"resto":121704486,"id":"qDZfvWkK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

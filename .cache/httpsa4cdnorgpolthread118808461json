This makes the tests much more detailed and useful and almost certainly makes AncestryDNA the most appealing choice. More will be released over the coming months, so let&#039;s say you won&#039;t just know I&#039;m German you&#039;ll know exactly what part of Germany are your ancestors from or what part of England or Scotland. This is insane, it even separates Cork and West Cork and there adding even more. Scotland alone has 6 regions. It also has many genetic regions for American colonist groups.<br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=e_d<wbr>JTQ_UUkc","filename":"scotlandsplit","ext":".png","w":508,"h":578,"tn_w":109,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490810949126,"time":1490810949,"md5":"WsYqiymt3wAZo7UmODmqSQ==","fsize":71767,"resto":118808461,"id":"dDAdq1v4","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"},{"no":118813473,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)14:10:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118808461\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118808461<\/a><br>tremble kike","filename":"1471305344894","ext":".png","w":618,"h":607,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":122,"tim":1490811018090,"time":1490811018,"md5":"wxPVJTNX2ixN8x9qh8zhGA==","fsize":86986,"resto":118808461,"id":"HlhwuH\/n","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]}

The entire reason that people living at northern latitudes developed pale skin was to more efficiently create vitamin D from the less abundant sunshine in their environments. <br><br>This applies double if you are also overweight due to how obesity depresses the bioavailability of d3. The lack of lactose tolerance among most dark skinned people further contributes to deficiency since most of the foods fortified with vitamin D are dairy products. Certain kinds of fish such as salmon can be good dietary sources as well but they tend to be seasonal or expensive. <br><br>Invest in a vitamin D supplement and\/or go outside more often to use the coming summer sunshine to increase your D levels. It will improve your mood and maybe even make you less resentful towards white people.","filename":"muh sun vitaminz","ext":".jpg","w":300,"h":400,"tn_w":187,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491569365446,"time":1491569365,"md5":"gE7G+ekwx+8ZaFHGQDM30w==","fsize":48321,"resto":0,"id":"kuutna+e","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"reminder-to-all-nonwhite-pollacks-that-if-you","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":119941671,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)08:51:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119941399\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119941399<\/a><br><br>And where do you live, Nebraska?","time":1491569506,"resto":119941399,"id":"QGA2M15x","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"}]}

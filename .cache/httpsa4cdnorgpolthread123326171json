In the world, we currently have more than two players active, and they have more pieces variety. Also the chess pieces are capable of changing sides. Who are these players and what are their pieces? I guess we can identify anglosphere as one, russphere, China, EU, Arab\/muslim world, Israel, Catholics, .... more?<br><br>What are their chess pieces? The countries, sometimes conglomerates, and sometimes parts of them, sometimes just organizations.<br><br>What do you think, what piece does your country represent and who is the [current] player(s)?<br><br>Let&#039;s start:<br>Germany: I think it&#039;s like a Rook - slow and inflexible, always walks straight, not well protected, but with a lot of power (economical, cultural, scientific) - 2 or more dimensions of straight attack, but less flexible in other dimensions (weak military, non-nuclear) . A bodyguard for the King. A central place where nuclear WW3 will start. Played by the Anglosphere and (((jews)))<br><br>As other examples - France might be a Bishop - also unflexible and limited, but in a different way, less powerful. Greece - a pawn - played by everyone - EU, USA, Russia, Turkey, very little power, but potential to turn strategically important. Hungary - a Knight, not much power but flexible and unpredictable, USA - a Queen, lots of power, lots of flexibility, best ally and protection for the King, most powerful but not most important....<br><br>Let&#039;s play, I want to see your honest opinions.","filename":"laibach-chess","ext":".jpg","w":363,"h":389,"tn_w":233,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493467058899,"time":1493467058,"md5":"VQ6P2NT+3EFRmzBdSOCq8w==","fsize":39359,"resto":0,"id":"i\/6rvDqt","country":"DE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"pol-chess-somewhat-philosophical-discussion","country_name":"Germany","replies":5,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":123326248,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)07:58:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"pretty sure germany is a jewish pawn<br><br>sage for autism","time":1493467120,"resto":123326171,"id":"AJWTTeV0","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123326431,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)08:01:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123326248\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123326248<\/a><br>Hmmm, a leaf....<br>Pretty sure a pawn slut for everyone - USA, UK, China, Russia, Arabs,....","time":1493467277,"resto":123326171,"id":"i\/6rvDqt","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":123326737,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)08:06:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"Come on, \/pol\/, show me your 5D-chess-face!","time":1493467562,"resto":123326171,"id":"i\/6rvDqt","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":123327482,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)08:16:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"don&#039;t let it slide, It&#039;s geopolitical discussion here","time":1493468200,"resto":123326171,"id":"i\/6rvDqt","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":123328168,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)08:26:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123326171\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123326171<\/a><br>I mean I see your point but regarding the state and giganticly enormous defucit we have, I&#039;d just have to give this one a sagerino my man. <br><br>See?","time":1493468782,"resto":123326171,"id":"49dAeNoY","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

Too few hours to accomplish anything\/make money, and too much free time. I like the 50-60 hour\/week range, you feel like you&#039;ve accomplished something when the weekend arrives. Besides, it&#039;s not like anyone does anything immediately upon getting home at 5:00. If I go out on the weekday it&#039;s more like 8,9ish.","time":1492751846,"resto":122096472,"id":"xb3FL9V5","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122100475,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)01:17:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122096762\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122096762<\/a><br>We have got to invest in women committing suicide just as much if not more than men.<br><br>Women will have to commit suicide twice as hard as men to get the same numbers.<br><br>Let&#039;s ensure that future women will have the same opportunities to an hero as men do.","time":1492751862,"resto":122096472,"id":"1qPeGtlw","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122100558,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)01:18:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122100143\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122100143<\/a><br><br>maybe, but automatically assuming she&#039;s cheating is crazy","time":1492751912,"resto":122096472,"id":"Rfzj6AQB","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122100658,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)01:19:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122100016\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122100016<\/a><br><a href=\"#p122100196\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122100196<\/a><br>Unless you own your own business working long hours and being proud of it makes you pathetic.","time":1492751976,"resto":122096472,"id":"ONWp3DaR","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122100773,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)01:20:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;45-50 hours a week<\/span><br><br>Boo fucking hoo.

The paradox of women&#039;s declining relative well-being is found across various datasets, measures of subjective well-being, and is pervasive across demographic groups and industrialized countries. Relative declines in female happiness have eroded a gender gap in happiness in which women in the 1970s typically reported higher subjective well-being than did men.

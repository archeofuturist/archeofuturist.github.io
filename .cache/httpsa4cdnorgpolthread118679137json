I&#039;m really creeped out by beaks. I&#039;m also scared of big dead eyes. I&#039;m scared of wide empty mouths. Scared of big heavy monsters. Scared of being eaten whole by a monster. As a kid he was a personification of my fears. I had to close my eyes or give the controller to my sister and leave the room when Dedede parts came up, because I got so scared. My friend bought a Kirby and Dedede plush doll from the anime (when the anime was blowing up on Fox Kids) and gave them to me for my birthday, since he knew I liked Kirby, I loved seeing Kirby but when I unwrapped Dedede I had a panic attack. I started sobbing and ran away from it, I ran away from home, got lost, and wandered around for several hours, until a policeman found me. For some reason I like him in 64 though, he&#039;s not scary in that one. Maybe it&#039;s the graphics. But even after 64, if I went back to Super Star or Dream Land to face him there, it&#039;s the same soul chilling terror and anxiety.<br><br>Thought you want to know.

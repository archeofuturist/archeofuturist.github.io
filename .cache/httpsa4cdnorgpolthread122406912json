I point out that we can&#039;t discuss Heidegger or Schmitt without the nazi thing and they say &quot;no but it&#039;s different because those two took on the nazi party card&quot;. It&#039;s like Lenin and Stalin invented a philosophy all of their own or something. <br><br>Meanwhile Christianity can&#039;t get a break from the inquisition and muh crusades, yet its #notallmuslims because those muslims are lone perpetrators and christianity was a system. But communism as we know it was a system too?<br><br>Or is this all flat out retarded and should I stop making sense of leftists or is there something I&#039;m overlooking?","filename":"marx","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":350,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":175,"tim":1492942367911,"time":1492942367,"md5":"cbr1yX66woSIKOExyNKUXQ==","fsize":85196,"resto":0,"id":"7qfP7lnv","country":"BE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"defending-communism","country_name":"Belgium","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

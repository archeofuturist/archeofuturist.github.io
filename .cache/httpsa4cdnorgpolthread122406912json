I point out that we can&#039;t discuss Heidegger or Schmitt without the nazi thing and they say &quot;no but it&#039;s different because those two took on the nazi party card&quot;. It&#039;s like Lenin and Stalin invented a philosophy all of their own or something. <br><br>Meanwhile Christianity can&#039;t get a break from the inquisition and muh crusades, yet its #notallmuslims because those muslims are lone perpetrators and christianity was a system.

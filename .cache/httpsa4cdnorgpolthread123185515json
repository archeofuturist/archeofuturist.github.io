And it&#039;s kind of my fault because I didn&#039;t pay much attention to what she was doing, she spent way to much time with those new people and developed a new way of thinking. But the thing is, I can still see her as the mother of my kids in the future and I really, really love her. And I must assume that she already fucked another guy in the meantime and that&#039;s the problem.<br>I wouldn&#039;t have a problem with a scenario where I would meet a chick who already had sex with other guys because that&#039;s before me so whatever, I had sex with others too and I would find it weird if she would have a problem with that. Of course, if she was a whore and had more than 20 guys, that&#039;s a nono but I&#039;m not talking about that.<br><br>But the situation I&#039;m in is different. I cannot stand the thought of my ex sleeping with another guy and even if she came back to me right now and sooner or later she must tell me the truth, if she did have sex with another guy, I couldn&#039;t take her back. That would make me the biggest cuck ever and I would rather watch her drown in her own fucked up life right now (which she currently is, when I talk to her she is destroyed and has to compensate that by getting wasted at parties) than taking her back.<br>But I still have deep feelings for her and maybe it&#039;s not to late to save her because I know she will kill herself sooner or later because of that.<br>She keeps telling me that she hasn&#039;t been that miserable ever before and that she knows that it&#039;s all her fault and I&#039;d like to save her but it has to happen now, because there is a 60% chance that she hasn&#039;t fucked a dude. I don&#039;t care if she wants to, I just want a pure woman.<br>If I take her back I will not trust her and will control her life more, what I should have done in the beginning.","filename":"c6b0e69d310f17ccc4a6e424bbfefb9b","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":450,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1493380402436,"time":1493380402,"md5":"lhcJdXH2cw8zFieuCvFjZQ==","fsize":31334,"resto":0,"id":"cDs9CBNn","country":"DE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"pol-i-need-your-advice-right-now","country_name":"Germany","replies":31,"images":4,"unique_ips":21},{"no":123185802,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)07:56:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"nah fuck that bitch, obviously do what ever you feel is best but i wouldnt take her back.","time":1493380617,"resto":123185515,"id":"xwLq15P6","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":123186082,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)08:00:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"Another info to consider:<br>Aside from being depressed all the time my life is getting better.

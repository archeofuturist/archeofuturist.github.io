In-game there are 100 senate seats, 50 governor seats, and an executive chief office that players can run for. Currently the GOP, aka the Republican Party holds a slim majority of these seats. Unfortunately the leftist &quot;New Deal Alliance&quot; and &quot;Libertarians&quot; (edgy centrists who are afraid to call themselves democrats) are gaining power quickly. These two opposition parties are made up of everything from literature-citing Marxists who cant argue worth a dime to full on Ancap. The fun of the game is mostly based in the massive discord community that has grown around the game. Here&#039;s the Republican GOP chat link below:<br>https:\/\/discord.gg\/qPuwB47<br>https:\/\/discord.gg\/qPuwB47<br>https:\/\/discord.gg\/qPuwB47<br><br>To start a new character you can follow this link to the game&#039;s homepage:<br>http:\/\/oppressive.games\/power\/index<wbr>.php<br>http:\/\/oppressive.games\/power\/index<wbr>.php<br>http:\/\/oppressive.games\/power\/index<wbr>.php<br><br>Besides the admittedly shitty coding of the developer, this game is extremely fun. Make sure to check the game, map before picking a state, as some states are very over-crowded (Texas, Cali), and it is very costly to move states.","filename":"power map","ext":".jpg","w":714,"h":486,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":170,"tim":1492632228722,"time":1492632228,"md5":"5bowObTck85ykPRKaJL3Ww==","fsize":61534,"resto":0,"country":"US","archived":1,"bumplimit":0,"archived_on":1492634649,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"power-political-simulator-game","country_name":"United States","replies":8,"images":0},{"no":121888365,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)16:06:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"Mark Norris is a cuck","time":1492632376,"resto":121888052,"country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121888502,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)16:07:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121888365\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121888365<\/a><br>Norris is a faggot u heard it here first","time":1492632448,"resto":121888052,"country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121888509,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)16:07:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121888365\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121888365<\/a><br>Mark Norris is literally worse than Dylan Vega","time":1492632453,"resto":121888052,"country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121889458,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)16:14:32","name":"Hindustan","com":"<a href=\"#p121888509\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121888509<\/a><br>Dont talk about the True Progressive like that you massive faggot","time":1492632872,"resto":121888052,"country":"CA","trip":"!!kea+d9IJG+E","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121889592,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)16:15:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121889458\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121889458<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;poor tier \/pol\/ tripfag<\/span>","time":1492632930,"resto":121888052,"country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121889939,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)16:18:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121889592\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121889592<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;britbong<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;american political simulation<\/span><br>Kys","time":1492633097,"resto":121888052,"country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121890551,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)16:22:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121889939\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121889939<\/a><br>I&#039;m actually finna be the next president, suck a dick colonial","time":1492633376,"resto":121888052,"country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121890723,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)16:24:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121890551\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121890551<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;its heydrich<\/span><br>DELET","time":1492633463,"resto":121888052,"country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]}

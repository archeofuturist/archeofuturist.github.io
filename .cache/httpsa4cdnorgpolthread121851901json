I am an atheist, which I know all of you will abhor, but I understand the repercussions of the demographic decline for whites in America. <br><br>I don&#039;t want whites to become a minority in America because I believe it will hinder our scientific progression and especially detriment the environment. <br><br>I don&#039;t know where I would fit in because most scientists are far-left and most white nationalists are far-right. <br><br>I do admire Richard Spencer though. He seems like a credible and charismatic guy with scientifically progressive views. <br><br>I&#039;d advise you to espouse more climate change rhetoric if you want to salvage western civilization. Scientists don&#039;t want to be subjugated by Muslims, but we still vote for the left-wing parties that are pro-Islam because of how anti-science most nationalist parties are. <br><br>That is just my word of advice to you. And no, you will not see my microscope.","filename":"IMG_20170418_201056","ext":".jpg","w":1836,"h":3264,"tn_w":140,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492613585484,"time":1492613585,"md5":"4PagZeaRjHznjHR0Wc39IQ==","fsize":1032258,"resto":0,"id":"t5kFX\/ll","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"board-settings-home","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

The study showed that about 10 years after the surgery, transgendered people began to have increased mental difficulties. As they progressed through life, their suicide mortality rose almost 20 times above the comparable nontransgender population. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Dr. McHugh notes that studies from Vanderbilt University and London\u2019s Portman Clinic of children who had expressed transgender feelings but for whom, over time, 70%-80% \u201cspontaneously lost those feelings.\u201d <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;More compelling than the malleability of transgender feelings among children is the recovery data of adult transgenders.

The study showed that about 10 years after the surgery, transgendered people began to have increased mental difficulties. As they progressed through life, their suicide mortality rose almost 20 times above the comparable nontransgender population. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Dr. McHugh notes that studies from Vanderbilt University and London\u2019s Portman Clinic of children who had expressed transgender feelings but for whom, over time, 70%-80% \u201cspontaneously lost those feelings.\u201d <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;More compelling than the malleability of transgender feelings among children is the recovery data of adult transgenders. Vanderbilt University and London\u2019s Portman Clinic found that 70% to 80% of adult transgenders who had refrained from undergoing gender-reassignment surgery report that their feelings dissipate over time. <\/span><br><br>In other words, for 70-80% of people who experience it gender dysphoria is a phase that will go away. This data also shows that sex reassignment surgery does NOT fix the suicide problem amongst transsexuals.<br><br>If surgery does NOT fix dysphoria, and the whole dysphoria is just a fucking phase anyways, I see absolutely no reason why it should be considered a treatment, and see absolutely no reason why treatment should not be focused on intensive psychotherapy to make the person feel comfortable in their biological sex until their dysphoria naturally passes (that&#039;s what the common treatment was until LGBTs made it not politically correct to do so).<br><br>Shit taken from:<br>https:\/\/fellowshipoftheminds.com\/20<wbr>15\/06\/06\/the-truth-about-transgende<wbr>rism-and-gender-reassigment-surgery<wbr>\/<br>I know it&#039;s an anti-trans article but they quote neutral studies, I&#039;ve specifically edited out of my greentext some content that supported this position but wasn&#039;t based on neutral studies.

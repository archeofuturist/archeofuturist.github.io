He gets to keep them too. <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;He&#039;s being tough on China and North Korea. He was meeting with the leader of China today. By pulling the trigger unannounced like this he&#039;s showing he&#039;s not fucking around with North Korea. No doubt a message to Iran as well. <\/span><br>Even if Syrian forces are grounded they still have Russian air support. Essentially nothing has changed strategically speaking. Victory is pretty much assured in Syria for Assad even with the IS push. Their victory will be short lived.","filename":"ada365119b83842a1fca54a330d8316ed2d0fa1fc97add5336f705c74083e181-pol","ext":".png","w":95,"h":92,"tn_w":95,"tn_h":92,"tim":1491627728413,"time":1491627728,"md5":"xP32WFUP\/WFi\/s0OAZu+kQ==","fsize":13563,"resto":0,"id":"ypxxAgtH","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"reeeeeee-shillss-reeeeee","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

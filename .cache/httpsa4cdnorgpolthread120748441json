People living with horrible conditions that make life a miserable existence should have the opportunity to pass away in a comfortable environment. Not by hanging themselves, drugging themselves into a painful death, slitting their wrists, jumping off a building, or shooting themselves. Then their family members find them in that pathetic and disgusting state. I think it should be allowed.<br>Choosing to die by Terry Pratchett is a marvelous movie on the subject. I advise watching it, but prepare for feels.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;abortion<\/span><br>The only debate here is the Christian idea about unborn fetuses already being considered to be a living being, and abortion is unethical due to this. It&#039;s a wishy-washy argument and I would like to read your opinions on this. I believe, since we can&#039;t really prove, or disprove this, that abortion should be allowed, so that people who made one mistake in their lives should not have to live with it for the rest of their lives, and their kids should not have to suffer, because of this.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;death penalty<\/span><br>It costs more to keep murderous monsters on death row than it does to keep them in prison.<br>What does \/pol\/ think? I&#039;m genuinely curious, and would like to see the general consensus about these subjects.","filename":"RIP old man Pratchett","ext":".jpg","w":650,"h":623,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":239,"tim":1491999160110,"time":1491999160,"md5":"HniSvJrGFHjcXKYYns8Jkg==","fsize":37895,"resto":0,"id":"ra28Wfce","country":"HU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"disucssion-of-death-in-society","country_name":"Hungary","replies":2,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":120749183,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)08:20:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"Giving myself on bump, in hopes of satiating my curiosity and getting replies.","time":1491999659,"resto":120748441,"id":"ra28Wfce","country":"HU","country_name":"Hungary"},{"no":120751137,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)08:44:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;doctor-assisted suicide<\/span><br>Better than kys","time":1492001072,"resto":120748441,"id":"Dyy5V995","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

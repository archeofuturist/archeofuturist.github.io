People living with horrible conditions that make life a miserable existence should have the opportunity to pass away in a comfortable environment. Not by hanging themselves, drugging themselves into a painful death, slitting their wrists, jumping off a building, or shooting themselves. Then their family members find them in that pathetic and disgusting state. I think it should be allowed.<br>Choosing to die by Terry Pratchett is a marvelous movie on the subject. I advise watching it, but prepare for feels.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;abortion<\/span><br>The only debate here is the Christian idea about unborn fetuses already being considered to be a living being, and abortion is unethical due to this. It&#039;s a wishy-washy argument and I would like to read your opinions on this. I believe, since we can&#039;t really prove, or disprove this, that abortion should be allowed, so that people who made one mistake in their lives should not have to live with it for the rest of their lives, and their kids should not have to suffer, because of this.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;death penalty<\/span><br>It costs more to keep murderous monsters on death row than it does to keep them in prison.<br>What does \/pol\/ think?

As I said in the OP, &quot;Choosing to die&quot; is a great, and personal documentary of Terry Pratchett conversing with people who are going to commit suicide due to their malicious diseases and conditions. It touches on how depression being the main motivator. If that is so, which would be considered normal, doctor-assisted suicide with proper evaluation could lead to unwanted suicides by people who are just on a down slope, but could be saved. Consider the hero paradox of not killing villains. They might get better and all that jazz.<br>The death penalty is morally wrong in many ways, and economically unsound.

A documented incident wear a bear in a Russian laboratory committed suicide by eating its paw off did happen. So, animals CAN reach that state where they commit suicide, but it is a human effect onto them. Following this reasoning, humans&#039; necessity for suicide might be a natural thing for them. We are different in intelligence from the rest of nature, and we do grasp abstract ideas such as religion and the meaning of life and such. That means, when it comes to suicide, other factors should be considered that&#039;s not natural. Suicide should not be considered murder, it should be considered a solution to an otherwise helpless situation.","time":1492003429,"resto":120748441,"id":"snm+ZeCB","country":"HU","country_name":"Hungary"},{"no":120755092,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)09:28:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120754618\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120754618<\/a><br>no one asked for their pathetic lives... why shouldn&#039;t they be able to take control and make to only real decision in your life?","time":1492003713,"resto":120748441,"id":"1Ie8xN32","country":"HU","country_name":"Hungary"},{"no":120755165,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)09:29:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120754618\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120754618<\/a><br>animal in captivity is not the &quot;bear&quot;, but attempt to trap Schroedinger kitty.

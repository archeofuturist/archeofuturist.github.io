Have fun with the degenerates, cucks, more heartland for me!<br>My buddies from high school both went this route. They said that shit about &quot;this town is a dead end&quot;. Well it ain&#039;t a dead end, bro, it&#039;s actually the finish line and I&#039;m already here!<br>I&#039;ve got a job using actual skills (mechanic) and I&#039;ll be able to support myself for the rest of my life this way.<br>Just wish liberal fucking mind-poison hadn&#039;t gotten most of the hotties.. I shudder at night thinking of the scum the girls I used to crush on must be spending their time with. They only allowed proper dancing at our prom, but I know these once-pure maidens are out &quot;grinding&quot; and &quot;dabbing&quot;. Ugh. Oh well, their loss.<br>The city is such a disgusting shit hole and seriously not worth it. We&#039;ve got bars and pills out here, so why leave?<br>Stay in your fucking home towns, \/pol\/, the cities aren&#039;t for us.","filename":"DSC_0452n","ext":".jpg","w":3000,"h":1994,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1490112617903,"time":1490112617,"md5":"MRVqR8v\/QIF4l7hYgKB6Qw==","fsize":3096576,"resto":0,"id":"kQgyBIvB","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"home-towns","country_name":"United States","replies":4,"images":0,"unique_ips":4},{"no":117638686,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)12:11:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"So who else is staying in their home town?","time":1490112717,"resto":117638537,"id":"kQgyBIvB","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117639312,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)12:18:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"This is likely a troll post but you got me. <br><br>I grew up in a shitty city in eastern Canada that had nothing going for it back then, had no opportunities, no economic growth and was full of unhappy, small-time people. <br><br>It&#039;s even worse now except throw in a huge opiate problem and a teenage prostitution problem.

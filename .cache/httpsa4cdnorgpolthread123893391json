Not only just because it&#039;s nigger beats but also because it&#039;s boring musically. I mean, 60&#039;s-80&#039;s black music was at least musically interesting. Rap is just boring musically and lyrically.","time":1493808160,"resto":123893391,"id":"cF2YfA5k","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123899521,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)06:44:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123898489\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123898489<\/a><br>True.","time":1493808252,"resto":123893391,"id":"R8zzosSS","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123899554,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)06:44:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123899151\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123899151<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Not appreciating decent storytelling<\/span><br><br>Not too much of that in rap anymore, sadly.

But also the most authentic subgenre, by being pure primal savageness, and closest to their pure culture. I hate Hopsin for trying to make rap &quot;sophisticated&quot;, which it never can become. You can never tame the savage. You dont have to agree or identfy with the music to find it enjoyable. Its like finding gorrillas in the zoo amusing, you suddenly dont get a urge to become one. Unless you are on the lesser fortunate spectrum of the bell curve that is, i guess.","time":1493809133,"resto":123893391,"id":"Q\/1dSz4r","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"}]}

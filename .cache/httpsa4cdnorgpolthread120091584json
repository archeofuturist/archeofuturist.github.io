You must be successful, reliable, hardworking, and, above all, happy. Do people in your life trust and respect you? What does your family think of you? Are you capable of starting and raising a healthy family? Racial politics doesn&#039;t have to be the only factor of that. If you can&#039;t achieve these things in your real life, then you are not ready to be a political activist, either anonymously or in reality.<br><br>Always remember: we live in first world countries and have opportunity that most people born on this planet don&#039;t. So work your ass off, every day, to build a good life for yourself and your family. Because if you can&#039;t make anything of your own, individual life, then how can you think you&#039;ll be able to make a difference for the race, for the lives of many? Spend your time wisely, and keep your real life priorities in order.

A loser, wageslave, uneducated man is enraged by the sight of a brave, college educated, highly literate women! <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;There\u2019s no need to be rude, I say.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;His head jerks around.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;You\u2019re rude, he counters. You\u2019re the one who\u2019s rude.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;No, I\u2019m not, I say.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;You are, he says. You\u2019re being rude.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The man is wearing a uniform, though not a very impressive one: a white short-sleeved synthetic shirt, black synthetic trousers, a cheap tie with the airport\u2019s insignia on it. It is no different from the uniform a bus driver might wear, or someone at a car-rental desk, someone who lacks any meaningful authority while also being forced into constant interaction with members of the public, someone for whom the operation of character is both nothing and everything. He is angry.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;His face is red, and his expression is unpleasant. He looks at me \u2014 a woman of 48 traveling alone, a woman who doubtless exhibits some signs of the privileged life she has led \u2014 with loathing. Apparently it is I, not he, who has broken the social code. Apparently it was rude of me to accuse him of rudeness.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I find myself relying on the details of the man\u2019s physical ugliness to prove the badness of his character.<\/span><br><br>https:\/\/mobile.nytimes.com\/2017\/02\/<wbr>15\/magazine\/the-age-of-rudeness.htm<wbr>l?","filename":"IMG_20170417_165812","ext":".jpg","w":480,"h":640,"tn_w":187,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492445840507,"time":1492445840,"md5":"6kX1SEurNNvFcXf9m7IPdw==","fsize":80218,"resto":0,"id":"6ZBqu81C","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"damn-a-loser-wageslave-uneducated-man-is-enraged","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

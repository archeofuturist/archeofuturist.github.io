The reason why it will not happen in our generation is simply because evolution has not made us different enough. While many of you may say things like &quot;thats not true, blacks have lower iq&#039;s than whites, different cranial structures, different behavioral patterns&quot; and i would agree, but it&#039;s just not as significant as the differences in birds for example. We still look almost entirely the same in terms of bone structure, only under closer examination and measurement will we find slight differences in size and shape. It is nowhere NEAR as significant as birds for example. Why is this so? Why is it that a penguin is significantly different than a pigeon, or a hawk? one glance at two different birds and everything from their diet to color, wingspan, skeletal structure, beak size, head to body ratio, talon size, is immediately visible, not just color and hair texture like in us humans. This is because humans are fairly young compared to birds. we&#039;ve been around for 5-10 million years where as birds have evolved over the course of 150 million years. <br>Give another hundred million years and we will be as diverse as the birds, and there will be much greater differences in us that are nearly impossible to avoid. And it will be just like in halo, the spartans vs the covenant, except niggers will not be as developed intellectually.","filename":"wtfbirdwarnow","ext":".gif","w":450,"h":513,"tn_w":219,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492745340001,"time":1492745340,"md5":"ELM225zCl4DRaSYLBD9PKQ==","fsize":20461,"resto":0,"id":"ZBYtIOEy","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"it-will-happen-inevitably-and-nothing-else-can","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":1,"unique_ips":2},{"no":122090449,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)23:38:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122089360\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122089360<\/a><br>Stop being an idiot.

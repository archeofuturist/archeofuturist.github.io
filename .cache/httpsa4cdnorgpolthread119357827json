I bet you&#039;re basing your ideological outlook on memes<br><br>First of all, the most important one is the no borders. Why are no borders economically beneficial? Because trucks move through them within the timeframe of 5 seconds. Put customs offices and restore the borders, and the same trucks will have to spend from half to an entire day at the border, waiting the queue to empty.<br><br>Now that&#039;s beneficial due to how supply chains work - delaying both the raw import and end product export of a chain causes a significant drop in profitability within it, since the exact same item that is produced for X time in a unified USA is produced for 2X-3X time in non-unified Europe. Which translates into two to three times slower emptying of inventory, which means that companies will have to take measure to not oversupply their inventories, which means a drop of overall throughput of 2 to 3 times.<br>Yes, in short, your companies become two to three times less competitive than those of China and the US. How do you compete in a globalized economy with them? It&#039;s simple - you can&#039;t, hence the need for the EU to unify and remove borders. If you were to break down the EU right now and do nothing else negative to it, the economy within it will shrink by at least a half from the fact alone that trucks have to go through 5 different borders and pay tariffs at each.<br><br><a href=\"#p119379771\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119379771<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What was EU&#039;s solution?

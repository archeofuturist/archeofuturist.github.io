At first I was worried Trump was being played like a puppet by neocons, since I don&#039;t believe Assad attacked with gas--and I don&#039;t see how it could be proven conclusively. Then I realized--it does not matter. Who give a crap about expending 50 cruise missiles and destroying some Syrian bunkers and planes? In a way .. it was a brilliant move, and I\u2019m ashamed I did not see it. This strike, where Trump warned the Russians and Syrians beforehand, achieved many good results without risking American lives, or hurting more Syrian lives. Whether the Syrians or the rebels gassed those people, Trump showed a public response which will shake up the balance of power in Syria. Assad&#039;s main advantage was having an air force when his opponents had none. And the backing of Russia. The US seemed impotent with Russia there. The idea of creating safe zones seemed impossible while Russia worked with Assad. The strikes proved Trump was not intimidated by Russia, it gets McCain and Graham supporting him politically (I know, they are dirt, but Trump needs to tone their criticism of his admin), and it gets the Russia Collaboration monkey off of his back--all in 50 fell swoops. Internationally, Trump looks decisive or nuts or both--which all accomplish the same goal--respect for the might of the US. Xi Jinping is chatting with Trump, and he will not fail to notice this display of Trump&#039;s willingness to pull the trigger. Tillerson goes to Moscow on Tuesday with a far better negotiating hand than before the strikes. Safe zones are essential for humanitarian reasons, and for keeping migrants out of Europe and the West, and Tillerson needs to get Putin on board with safe zones with no fly areas. What appeared to be a stalemate, now is shaken up, and possibilities for peace in the region are improved.&quot; ...

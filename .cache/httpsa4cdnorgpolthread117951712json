Fell has noted: &quot;References to wealisc women are usually to slaves, and an ethnic class distinction is suggested in the riddles of the Exeter Book between the blonde (hwitlocced) daughter of an Anglo-Saxon nobleman and the dark-haired (wonfeax) Welsh slave&quot;. According to Day (2001): &quot;dark colouring in the Exeter Book characterizes as low status, especially for the British servants&quot;. Riddle 49 and 52 both describe swarthy\/dark haired Britons, while Riddle 72 describes a lower class &#039;dark&#039; Welsh herdsman (sweartum hyrde).

When told they were called &quot;Anglii&quot; (Angles), he replied with a Latin pun that translates well into English: \u201cBene, nam et angelicam habent faciem, et tales angelorum in caelis decet esse coheredes\u201d (&quot;It is well, for they have an angelic face, and such people ought to be co-heirs of the angels in heaven&quot;).<\/span>","time":1490293630,"resto":117951712,"id":"wbizxWY0","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":117963908,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)14:27:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117951897\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117951897<\/a><br>OIL.

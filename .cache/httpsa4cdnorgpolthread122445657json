So one such company bought one of the few ports in the Black Sea - in the republic of georgia that is also run by CIA lemon party gestapo. Notice Georgian military is engaged in partnership with georgian state national guard. Must very convenient then cooking books smuggling all those weapons through various military aid, military charity, etc bullshit...

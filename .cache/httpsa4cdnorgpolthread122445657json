Another thing to keep in mind that CIA lemon party gestapo has enacted lawfare related offshore rules and regulations in UAE allowing registering offshore companies for a few years now. So one such company bought one of the few ports in the Black Sea - in the republic of georgia that is also run by CIA lemon party gestapo. Notice Georgian military is engaged in partnership with georgian state national guard. Must very convenient then cooking books smuggling all those weapons through various military aid, military charity, etc bullshit... Keep in mind very important blip in history - the crematorium with hundreds of american bodies scattered all over the place in georgia.","time":1492966493,"resto":122445657,"id":"i6yNeBE+","country":"LT","country_name":"Lithuania"},{"no":122447382,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)12:57:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122445657\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122445657<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;oil<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;funding international terrorism with said oil<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;big airport<\/span>","time":1492966630,"resto":122445657,"id":"pNNhQ5sc","country":"BE","country_name":"Belgium"},{"no":122447674,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)12:59:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122445657\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122445657<\/a><br>Rich as fuck saudi funzone with skyscrapers &amp; secret bars.<br>I&#039;d probably try going if I had the money, my friend&#039;s brother works there &amp; he loves it.","time":1492966751,"resto":122445657,"id":"y+1tgZk9","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"},{"no":122447728,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)12:59:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"They have ISIS tier laws<br><br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Unite<wbr>d_Arab_Emirates#Law<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Kissing in public is illegal and can result in deportation.[181] Expats in Dubai have been deported for kissing in public.[182][183][184] In Abu Dhabi, people have been sentenced to 80 lashes for kissing in public.[185] A new federal law in the UAE prohibits swearing in Whatsapp and penalizes swearing by a $68,061 fine and imprisonment;[186] expatriates are penalized by deportation.[186][187][188][189] In July 2015, an Australian expatriate was deported for swearing on Facebook.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Amputation is a legal punishment in the UAE due to the Sharia courts.[198][199][200][201][202] Crucifixion is a legal punishment in the UAE.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;During the month of Ramadan, it is illegal to publicly eat, drink, or smoke between sunrise and sunset.[18] Exceptions are made for pregnant women and children.

When I say &quot;villain&quot; I mean in the Disney sense, where there is a designated bad guy the audience is meant to feel contempt for. The more you fight nearly 100 years of Jew media painting nationalists, pro-whites and WASPs as evil the more it looks like you&#039;re protesting something. That doesn&#039;t really get you anywhere.<br><br>So why not embrace it? If you egg on the boos and the jeers, suddenly your audience (as in anyone observing) finds it tiresome and boring, making it more likely they&#039;ll casually listen to you rather than immediately and subconsciously discredit you. Similarly anyone painted as heroes or favorable by kike media (Islam, homos, trannies, feminists, liberal beta males, cuckservatives) will be judged in comparison to you based on the merit of their argument, of which there is none.<br><br>Just think about it like this: who do you remember from the movie Hercules? If the protagonist&#039;s name wasn&#039;t in the title would anyone really remember or like any character but Hades?","filename":"rehost%2F2016%2F9%2F13%2F682525ae-7508-489a-bd33-63f2960eb514[1]","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":720,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1491215670346,"time":1491215670,"md5":"tL56TuJKJvq5EeC3nR0wsQ==","fsize":86880,"resto":0,"id":"P8+1lN12","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"why-dont-you-guys-just-embrace-a-role-as-villains","country_name":"United States","replies":6,"images":2,"unique_ips":6},{"no":119314709,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)06:36:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119314589\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119314589<\/a><br>Meg is a god-tier love interest.

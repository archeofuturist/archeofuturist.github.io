If America were a man, he would be obese, overly confident and arrogant, shallow, vacant, and materialistic. I&#039;m not surprised, but horrified how repulsive the average citizen behaves. Everyone is a dickhead or cunt. Most individuals are dangerously far removed from reality. Life became so easy in the US, that people became careless and oblivious to everything around them, outside their little Disney land artificial bubble of a life. Even when presented with facts and notions of dire consequences, the average American will ignorantly exclaim, &quot; so what?! Just watch football you pussy!&quot; Our public education system is a complete joke, a cruel one at that. Our healthcare system is a disaster. Our economy is extremely bankrupted. This nation has fought nothing but bullshit dog and pony show wars for the last half century. American culture = bread and circus. I&#039;d love to see it all come crashing down in my life time.

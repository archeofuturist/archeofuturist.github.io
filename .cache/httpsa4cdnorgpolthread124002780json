I fell in love with an energetic, charismatic activist I met in November. He said all the right things to convince me that he cared about women\u2019s rights and activism. In February, I decided to return to Turkey with the promise of love driving me forward. I couldn\u2019t have known things would turn sour.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Then came our first fight. I had wanted to interview a local woman for an article on Syrian refugees.

Of course, as a Western woman, no one had ever forbidden me from speaking with anyone else. It was a strange feeling: Don\u2019t I have a mouth to speak? Why can I not use it as I wish?<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Unwanted sex? Rape? All the time. He did not stop to determine whether I consented to sex.

It is quite common for Indians, particularly middle-aged ones, to believe that Indian traditions are the greatest in the world. Or that the epic literary works are books of science- the most disappointing part is that even some accomplished researchers believe that is the case. And all of these people want to retain this culture. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The problem I see is, people think that ideas of civil liberties and equality are somehow owned by &quot;the west&quot;. And they think that adopting these basic principles is the same as acknowledging that &quot;the west&quot; is superior to India. Given that western Europe and USA are quite far ahead in terms of GDP and scientific research, culture is the all they have to make themselves feel better. And they point to the adoption of yoga and other spiritual teachings from India in USA to say, &quot;See, they know we had it all right.

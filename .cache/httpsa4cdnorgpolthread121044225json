The sheer volume of competing religions filled me with doubt, and I never managed to overcome that. I know a lot of people on either side of the faith coin, but my own indecisiveness is starting to weigh on me.<br><br>Do any of you believe anything? If so, how do you support it in debate\/under critique? Why do you think your faith is the correct one, and how did you come to that conclusion?","filename":"OrthodoxChurchBulgaria[1]","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":426,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1492164755610,"time":1492164755,"md5":"8TixOA6hrvGFyJnCY7V8Sw==","fsize":201488,"resto":0,"id":"PVZDnmS4","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"finding-faith","country_name":"United States","replies":7,"images":1,"unique_ips":4},{"no":121044568,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)06:17:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121044225\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121044225<\/a><br>Wew lad \/pol\/ is fast, but I think there&#039;s a Good Friday thread up already, too.","time":1492165029,"resto":121044225,"id":"PVZDnmS4","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121044594,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)06:17:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121044225\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121044225<\/a><br>Do you not pay attention to any of the religious threads that allow you to ask anything?","time":1492165054,"resto":121044225,"id":"C+XBpErD","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121044671,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)06:18:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"Considering how easy it would be for anyone to write in a &quot;holy book&quot; like the bible (THE WORLDS LONGEST RUNNING GAME OF TELEPHONE) I don&#039;t care what the books say and just choose to believe there is a God. Not a particular God just that one exists. Because there are so many religions out there the odds of choosing the right one are slim. I like having options ie not being restricted in what I do or say because God said so in a book. But if any God is real my bet would be Jesus or Kek, but again no clue so. \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_\/\u00af","time":1492165114,"resto":121044225,"id":"Y90h95ob","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121044759,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)06:19:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121044594\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121044594<\/a><br>I don&#039;t come to \/pol\/ often, but you&#039;re right: I should&#039;ve checked the catalog.","time":1492165189,"resto":121044225,"id":"PVZDnmS4","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121044771,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)06:19:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"I consider myself a deist.<br>I think that there is a higher force, but since we don&#039;t actually know jack shit about it nor it seems to give a single fuck about us (apparently because everything is made perfect, and under &quot;perfect&quot; I mean self-regulating and not requiring any interference), it doesn&#039;t matter.","filename":"1479213012745","ext":".gif","w":540,"h":540,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492165197453,"time":1492165197,"md5":"Vg65TnPIuJbKir2gD4wd+Q==","fsize":1315468,"resto":121044225,"id":"ksle1Vin","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":121044861,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)06:21:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121044771\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121044771<\/a><br>and not requiring any intervention*","time":1492165272,"resto":121044225,"id":"ksle1Vin","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":121045323,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)06:28:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121044771\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121044771<\/a><br>Deism is interesting to me.

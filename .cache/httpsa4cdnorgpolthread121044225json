This concept has been (among many others, appearance, free will etc.) one of the traditional understandings of &quot;made in God&#039;s image.&quot; Similar, one can consider beauty. There is a certain biological basis for beauty, of course, like finding someone attractive, or a food appetizing, yet what biological basis is there for finding beauty in, say, a nebula, or a amoeba, or some other thing in which we should under no circumstance have evolved the ability to appreciate, considering how recently we&#039;ve discovered them. Infact, consider how many times you have been confronted with something entirely new, and yet with immediacy was able to appreciate its beauty, even before understanding it. This again shows us the significance of reflectivity.<br><br>For traditonal Christianity, reflectivity has a divine counterpart in the Trinity. The Logos, the second member of the Trinity, is part of this Divine reflective, it is God&#039;s eternal, and perfect knowledge of Himself. An eternal, divine, and uncreated Knowledge, because only such a thing could truly understand its Source.","time":1492168293,"resto":121044225,"id":"PDh9dOzI","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121048554,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)07:12:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121047602\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121047602<\/a><br>I think you&#039;re coming at this the wrong way, anon.

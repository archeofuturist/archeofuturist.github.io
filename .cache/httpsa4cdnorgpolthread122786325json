His entire belief is juvenile and can be pondered by anyone who has struggled in poverty. You&#039;ve never tried coming up with a better way to structure society so that everyone wins? Did you realize it was bullshit and what is now labeled as communism? Marx didn&#039;t haven&#039;t the luxury of having record of it. It&#039;s asinine and wrong you can&#039;t play with free will like you can a chess piece.","time":1493157744,"resto":122786325,"id":"TjcFkWuL","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122795048,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)18:03:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122786752\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122786752<\/a><br>ooh noooo","time":1493157826,"resto":122786325,"id":"6O7gGY3s","country":"BE","country_name":"Belgium"},{"no":122795608,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)18:08:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"too weeaboo flag","time":1493158088,"resto":122786325,"id":"qZNxjJQj","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":122795741,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)18:09:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122794880\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122794880<\/a><br>I&#039;m not arguing for Marx, I&#039;m telling you that Marxism and Fascism are fundamentally different and cannot be likened to each other.<br><br>Communists will tell you that Fascism is capitalism, while capitalists will tell you that Fascism is communism.

It&#039;s tribal and chaotic but it&#039;s apparent nature becomes obfuscated by limited understanding. However it can be identified in hindsight after all the factors preventing the ability to understand are no longer in play for example; the confusion and stress brought on by restructuring a government while trying to limit unrest.

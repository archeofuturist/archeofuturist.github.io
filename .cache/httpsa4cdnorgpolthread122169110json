The burning bush that Moses observed serves as an example of theosophy. Today, the New testament&#039;s promise of the baptism of the Holy Spirit and fire is being poured out across the land . The gifts and operations of the Holy Spirit as in the Book of Acts is observable theosophy being demonstrated before our very eyes. We are given the hope of theology: eternal life and even freedom from sinful bondages in this life. Are you familiar with the idea of homeostasis? Homeostasis is the best state for man, and is even explored by Aristotle&#039;s ethical works. People may tell you things like that being an alpha male is the best form of homeostasis, or excelling in your vocation is the best form of homeostasis. But theology reveals the best form of homeostasis is praising the living God by which good is ultimately defined. I know those of you reading this may not believe me, but attend a church that believes in the works and acts of the holy spirit. Even if it&#039;s just once.

Also, that gas that they supposedly used was expensive to produce. So much so that it would&#039;ve saved the German government hundreds of millions to just dig a hole and shoot them (which they did, and which we have pictures of). The pictures of starving Jews exist because allied bombing took out a lot of infrastructure and warehouses used to deliver and store food. Lots of German civilians and soldiers starved too.","filename":"1491609306749","ext":".jpg","w":400,"h":400,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492495858492,"time":1492495858,"md5":"tHFewHrLd+pXiE0qd652Lg==","fsize":36812,"resto":121647689,"id":"sH3ypIqc","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121648424,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)02:12:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"I needed that kek, thanks OP","time":1492495943,"resto":121647689,"id":"oLhmQ4+p","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121649516,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)02:25:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"15 minutes in, great video OP","time":1492496730,"resto":121647689,"id":"Ns7YN7Eh","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121649649,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)02:27:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121647689\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121647689<\/a><br>Build a gas chamber replica and try it on yourself.<br>Since the Zyklon B won&#039;t kill you, it would show the world what a hoax it is.","time":1492496821,"resto":121647689,"id":"M5e\/7vqd","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121650078,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)02:32:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121647689\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121647689<\/a><br>Blocked in germany, what a surprise","time":1492497141,"resto":121647689,"id":"Zbw4jL4e","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":121650472,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)02:37:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121647689\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121647689<\/a><br>150k jews starved\/ tuberculosised to death when the nazi supply trains couldn&#039;t keep up towards the end of the war.<br><br>Big deal.

Now lets say the USA and Britain work in coalition develop nukes (guns) the next time the people are pitted against each other the US have a clear upper hand with now extra confidence and other countries will hesitate to attack them. Now even if each country has multiple people if every country has guns there will be heavy losses that could jeopardise a countries cause or influence on the world and no country would like to take that risk and lose that many people so they would all want to disarm\/ eradicate the use of guns from this fight however a country can&#039;t get rid of it&#039;s guns and then tell another one to disarm using the threat of daggers as they will be outgunned the only way to get a country to disarm is to have a superior fire power to them so they are intimidated only then can you remove them.","time":1493468100,"resto":123317949,"id":"vqomYbyp","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123327449,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)08:16:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123327340\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123327340<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;america will eventually<\/span><br><br><br>which america?<br><br>south america?<br><br>yes I agree<br><br>gringo<br><br>ehhehe","filename":"while in the mean time","ext":".jpg","w":350,"h":277,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":98,"tim":1493468169087,"time":1493468169,"md5":"P9qL4OceOGYNCQQpLFmxNA==","fsize":27303,"resto":123317949,"id":"L8dNT6pe","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":123327525,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)08:17:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123327287\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123327287<\/a><br>English is an extremely hybridized Germanic trade language trying to squeeze its phonics into your goofy alphabet intended for clicks and whistles.

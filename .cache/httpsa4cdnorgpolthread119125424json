Like a car, the more you use it the more work\/tune ups it&#039;ll need. Our bodies will naturally start to wither if we don&#039;t maintain active\/healthy lifestyles. <br><br>I&#039;m assuming you got the infowars stuff and just like any other vitaliy supplement, it depends on your lifestyle and your body&#039;s reaction. <br><br>The ingredients in this supplement are all herbal so no need to worry about shit other than minor side effects like nausea, headaches, tachycardia, etc. Of course, side effects vary person to person. <br><br>I say try it for a week or two but incorporate some life style changes like home made meals if you have the time, working out more (if all you&#039;re concerned about is sex drive then do more endurance based workouts i.e cardio like H.I.I.T, sprints, anything in intervals. <br><br>You have to treat these supplements like a fat burner. It won&#039;t do its job unless you make other changes in your lifestyle as well. <br><br>Believe me, you&#039;ll notice a difference in your energy, sex drive, mood, etc in about a day or maybe few days. Nothing crazy, but enough to notice (its just your body getting more endorphins pumped though your blood which is the minor feeling of euphoria, boost of energy you&#039;ll start to notice).","time":1491011147,"resto":119125424,"id":"SZis14w4","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119129086,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)21:52:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119128433\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119128433<\/a><br>I just wanted to add that there may be a point where that &quot;euphoria&quot; or mild body high may not seem like it was at first then you lose motivation and give up on the supplement. <br><br>This is bound to happen.<br><br>After a while your body will just get used to the excess endorphins you&#039;re now starting to produce and you might take it as the supplement wearing off or like it was probably a placebo effect. <br><br>Truth is that it may be a placebo, and your body is definitely getting used to the hormone change. You can&#039;t let that thought discourage you or your SO to give up on the life style changes you made when you started taking the supplement. Its important to remember this and that you can&#039;t keep the same boring old routine everyday, that way you never find a dull moment and it feels new to you all the time.","time":1491011537,"resto":119125424,"id":"SZis14w4","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

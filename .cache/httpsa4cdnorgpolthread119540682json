Beyond expressed fears of a vast &quot;counterrevolutionary&quot; or fascist homosexual conspiracy, there were several high profile arrests of Russian men accused of being pederasts.[16] In 1933, 130 men &quot;were accused of being &#039;pederasts&#039; \u2013 adult males who have sex with boys. Since no records of men having sex with boys at that time are available, it is possible this term was used broadly and crudely to label homosexuality.&quot;[16] Whatever the precise reason, homosexuality remained a serious criminal offense until it was repealed in 1993.[16]<\/span><br><br>The Soviet gays were \/lgbtpol\/ fascists though.","time":1491352738,"resto":119540682,"id":"K7GaFGfo","country":"NZ","country_name":"New Zealand"},{"no":119541823,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)20:39:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119540682\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119540682<\/a><br>They ran out of everyone else money.","filename":"billy","ext":".jpg","w":360,"h":198,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":68,"tim":1491352772087,"time":1491352772,"md5":"BIksm4+X4cn1IZ7KZugR0A==","fsize":18711,"resto":119540682,"id":"1TCbS0ca","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119541838,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)20:39:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119541630\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119541630<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;specie<\/span>","filename":"lemerchanthands","ext":".png","w":215,"h":215,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491352783885,"time":1491352783,"md5":"tOExhxTz3DSftR+ZUi2Dsw==","fsize":9418,"resto":119540682,"id":"GVhPmPDT","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119541861,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)20:39:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119540682\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119540682<\/a><br>You do know those are for propaganda purposes right pedro?

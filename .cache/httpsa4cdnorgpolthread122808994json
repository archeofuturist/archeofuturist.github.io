For me this is around ~5000 euro I put in a basket of shares I personally think have a lot of growing effort and also pay a good dividend right now. Every quarter I spend an entire weekend looking through all the financial statements and look for more financial oppertunities. On average my invested capital doubles every 4-5 years.

Investing into certain stocks from certain nations sometimes gives you tax rebates and other incentives.

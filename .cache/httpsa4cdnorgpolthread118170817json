They will pick at their nails, sit in a kind of stretched out wanna be dominant manner, treat sex and relationships like men would in a &quot;would you fuck her&quot; kind of way. Not to mention all the ways they want to seem in control and dominant and important in movies and culture.<br><br>I realized this when I seen a younger who I see usually walking to school react to me. I&#039;m a tall guy and girls seems to like me and she sees me time to time. I had my sun glasses on and seen her comming and I saw how her face went from a very femine reaction of shock and surprise to nervousness as she fidgeted around adjusting her hair. Then something intresting happened I expected her walk by and maybe give me a smile or a giggle something femine. Instead she put on this wanna be stoic type face trying to show she wasn&#039;t paying attention to me. That&#039;s when I thought that she and women in general might just be imitating masculine reactions that they respond too.","filename":"1490398853033-1","ext":".jpg","w":604,"h":403,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1490408568393,"time":1490408568,"md5":"8SV\/i7wGdK\/MlCrv2sojkg==","fsize":31559,"resto":118170817,"id":"e53mGS65","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118172203,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)22:23:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"The idea that woman are &quot;feminine&quot; and men are &quot;masculine&quot; is false. Both sexes are masculine, aggressive, and territorial, but men just excel at masculinity so it infantilizes women by contrast. Males fight other males for access to various things.

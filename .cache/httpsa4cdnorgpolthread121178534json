Scientists and people who care about science are an intersectional group, embodying a diverse range of races, sexual orientations, gender identities, abilities, religions, ages, socioeconomic and immigration statuses. We, the march organizers, represent and stand in solidarity with historically underrepresented scientists and science advocates.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;We acknowledge that society and scientific institutions often fail to include and value the contributions of scientists from underrepresented groups. Systems of privilege influence who becomes a part of the science community, what topics we study, and how we apply our work in creating new technologies and crafting policy. We recognize that, historically and today, some scientific endeavors have been used to harm and oppress marginalized communities.<\/span>","filename":"Wellesly calls for violence against hate speech","ext":".png","w":704,"h":427,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":151,"tim":1492236510298,"time":1492236510,"md5":"sLmceQppm2UiBO3ACkG+tw==","fsize":188199,"resto":0,"id":"O0cZH9Z8","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"ive-had-it-with-leftists-shutting-down-our-events","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

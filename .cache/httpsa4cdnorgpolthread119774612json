Living rurally is a lot more work than you think, especially if you live in areas with heavy snow or rain. Also, &quot;living off the grid&quot; is harder than you think, as states and municipalities regulate this - a lot of areas require being connected to the electrical grid, and in some areas, getting a septic tank installed means dealing with environmentalists. Some places will only allow hunting cabin type buildings, but not permanent dwellings. In most places, collecting rain water is illegal, so you&#039;d better be able to dig a well. No well? No permit. Oh, and in most places it&#039;s illegal to camp on your own land for over 2 weeks, without special and hard to get permits, even if you&#039;re building a house. And the size house you&#039;re building matters in a lot of places. <br><br>It&#039;s not the Wild West anymore. <br><br>Plus, people like having grocery stores, police, fire, hospitals, and regular mail service. <br><br>A lot of the cheap land you could buy that&#039;s rural is either useless, or only good for occasional cattle grazing.

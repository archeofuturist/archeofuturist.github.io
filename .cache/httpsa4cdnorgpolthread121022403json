First of all, it&#039;s based off a lie - that we&#039;re cucked because our Prime Minister is a \u201ccuck\u201d, as you call it. That isn&#039;t even true. Justin Trudeau is a former boxer, snowboarder, and environmentalist. Name me one &quot;real&quot; man who can claim even two of those things! Secondly, Canadians aren&#039;t shitposters. We speak our feelings. We tell you the truth. We share our opinions. If that&#039;s what counts as shitposting these days, then call me an Aussie. I don&#039;t know why Americans are so intimidated by hearing genuine, thoughtful criticism of their country and their politics, but you obviously are. All I can say to that is: deal with it. It&#039;s the 21st century. This is the information age. If information scares you, then go back to your bumfuck trailer somewhere and hang on to your delusions. So what if we welcome refugees and are legalizing weed? Me? I&#039;m a freethinker. I&#039;m an idea man. I thrive off of enthusiasm. And I fucking love science. So when a Canadian is nice enough to offer you constructive criticism, take it as a compliment. Because we want to see you thrive as a country. We want to see you progress and follow us into the future.<br><br>End Canada-hate NOW.","filename":"canflag","ext":".jpg","w":300,"h":168,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1492148798015,"time":1492148798,"md5":"i44tqwWZBy7AHORNrPBqyA==","fsize":13970,"resto":121022403,"id":"PtmkJ8b4","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121025323,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)01:46:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121024663\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121024663<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;2013<\/span><br><br>try current year sweetie","time":1492148804,"resto":121022403,"id":"DrKDt39n","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121025325,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)01:46:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121025149\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121025149<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;try hards<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;just say something a leftist would and spam &#039;rural and suburban retard&#039;<\/span><br><br>if only people stopped feeding them","filename":"IMG_0998","ext":".png","w":587,"h":466,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":99,"tim":1492148805907,"time":1492148805,"md5":"iurns+En2LoVpa4JS2MUAQ==","fsize":23080,"resto":121022403,"id":"khNwOjdN","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121025422,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)01:48:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121025126\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121025126<\/a><br>pffft! prove it, post something<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;hilarious<\/span>","time":1492148886,"resto":121022403,"id":"aIb0kA58","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121025509,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)01:49:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121025314\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121025314<\/a><br>CALM THE FUCK DOWN","time":1492148943,"resto":121022403,"id":"TQv9CGvn","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121025558,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)01:49:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"Reminder that the following are the three kinds of \/pol\/<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;USA<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Norway<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Australia<\/span><br><br>Prove me wrong. <br><br>Protip: You cant","filename":"justincastro","ext":".png","w":1182,"h":886,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1492148975427,"time":1492148975,"md5":"+IN7lj1p2c5nW6JOKjpQwg==","fsize":1262477,"resto":121022403,"id":"w+O1Xt+6","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":121025584,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)01:49:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121025314\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121025314<\/a><br>Fuck me, a little defensive aren&#039;t we?","time":1492148996,"resto":121022403,"id":"HcN5XeQO","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":121025596,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)01:50:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121025314\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121025314<\/a><br><br>You talk like a fag and your shits all retarded.","time":1492149007,"resto":121022403,"id":"w+O1Xt+6","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121025622,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)01:50:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121022403\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121022403<\/a><br>I seriously can&#039;t get over how much April Fools revealed that the FUCKING LEAFs are the problem on almost every board on this site. \/vint\/ and \/spa\/ were real eye-openers, even though I already knew that Canadians always make absolutely abhorrent posts.","filename":"1477891107516","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":333,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1492149027285,"time":1492149027,"md5":"93keIDr8j2pi9AnqB3Xw0g==","fsize":119591,"resto":121022403,"id":"wxRUgp4g","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121025683,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)01:51:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121025558\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121025558<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Norway<\/span><br><br>kings at bashing Swedes for sure","time":1492149075,"resto":121022403,"id":"khNwOjdN","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121025695,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)01:51:20","name":"Anonymous","filename":"1484207400433","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":999,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":121,"tim":1492149080825,"time":1492149080,"md5":"qqDIeiIyDX07P9++GMhFWQ==","fsize":80859,"resto":121022403,"id":"\/Iwb77oL","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121025710,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)01:51:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121025314\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121025314<\/a><br>how does your post help the reputation of canada at all?<br>you just cried for 8 lines, shitcunt leafposter.","time":1492149093,"resto":121022403,"id":"aIb0kA58","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121025754,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)01:52:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"Also, the only Australians I know are fucking hippie outdoor-sports types who come here to become snowboarding and rock-climbing instructors but end up working some shitty job until they build up enough money to leave.

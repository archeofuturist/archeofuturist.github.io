This is a lie, and immigration exemplifies its falsity.<br><br>I will start by noting the logical theory behind anti-immigration advocates. Unlike some would claim, opposition to immigration isn&#039;t a racially based theory- fundamentally, it is a CULTURALLY based theory. It just so happens that race and culture are inseparable, and symbiotically linked in a plethora of ways. <br><br>Now, culture is a fabric of society, crafted through the medium of ancestry. The culture that individuals adhere to is largely determined by the circumstances they grew up in; the values of their parents, their towns, their communities. As such different communities, separated from each other and free to endorse individual collective dogmas, become segregated. As different individuals assert influence independent of one another- whether it be Washington in America, or Ghandi in India, nations envelop themselves in unique historical experiences and cultural nuances. This is the origin of national identity, the origin of culture, and it is a fundamental law of sociology. <br><br>In this manner, different &quot;races&quot; develop differing cultures, as race signifies nothing more than an individual&#039;s regional derivation, with its own, unique culture. Of course, this model of social theory simplifies situations for the purpose of concise analysis; the reality is, all societies are not culturally homogenous, and there always will be cultural deviants. But all functioning societies share this aspect, if not a homogenous culture, a dominant culture.<br><br>What occurs when we attempt to obliterate this aspect of humanity? Immigration is nothing more than an infiltration of dominance by foreign cultures. In the name of diversity and tolerance, many on the Left adore it. In reality, they should hate it.","time":1490163848,"resto":117730034,"id":"7NVNraLc","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":117730174,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)02:24:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117730101\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117730101<\/a><br><br>If any nation desires to call itself a society it must have a dominant culture. This dominance would not and should not be enforced by the state; indeed, it will come about naturally, because of the theory of \u201cnational experience.\u201d As briefly outlined prior, a nation, with its own laws, prominent individuals, accomplishments, and disasters, will inevitably distinguish its identity from other nations. Individuals in the nation will know a different experience to any other. <br><br>Many mock the notion that cultural homogeneity results in societal stability, but it is fundamentally true. Individuals are part of a whole, rather than shards of glass in a sea of sand, and they are more willing to contribute to the society which has rewarded them with warmth, love and acceptance. All which is natural; what the Left denies is the fundamental nature of humanity. Often said it is that humans are social creatures, and true it is; we desire acceptance, and cultural homogeneity provides this opportunity. <br><br>Why it then that relative homogeneity is so demonised by the Left? False notions of progress, of sympathy guide them to a mirror of delusion. Social points are not scored by undermining the stability and social acceptance homogeneity provides to us. The position of the Left is only consistent when viewed through the lens of a different humanity, an unselfish, gratuitous humanity, a humanity which exists more in the realm of Disneyland. <br><br>The anti-immigration stance of Japan, and its subsequent influence on life expectancy, are well documented, and I will not go into any more statistical detail here. But it is useful study to consider cultural integration; the cultural stance of Japan is well known and as a nation exerts cultural influence because of it. By any measure of a successful society- vocational standards, HDI, income inequality- Japan is tremendously accomplished.","time":1490163893,"resto":117730034,"id":"7NVNraLc","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":117730225,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)02:25:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117730174\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117730174<\/a><br><br>What then, would occur if we strip Japan of its homogeneity? The West offers some clues as to the detriments of immigration. Immigrants are influenced and ascribe to cultural doctrines often radically different to the nations they are moving to. That this is not always the case is self-evident, but as outlined prior each society has cultural nuances which when imbalanced can destabilise a nation.<br><br>The fundamental contradiction lies in the fact that a nation, by definition, must have a dominant culture. First generation immigrants are, except in exceptional cases, unable to fully assimilate into these dominant cultures, in some cases unwilling even to attempt integration. We cannot blame immigrants for this; again, this is fundamental human nature, which immigration is the antithesis of. What we tend to see, then, is the development of subcultures within a society. Immigrants cannot assimilate into the dominant culture, and so remain ascribed to their own, naturally concentrating those of a similar culture in particular regions across the society. <br><br>How could any mildly consistent intellectual claim this phenomenon to benefit the society? Destabilisation is inevitable; multiple, concentrated cultures pit themselves against the dominant culture and as the fight for food amongst a pack of wolves, tensions between the regions are exacerbated. What we have created, then, is a collapse of the society into multiple, with one fledgling, formerly dominant piece attempting to regain control. This is not sustainable, not consistent, and not a society. At current rates of immigration, especially in the United States, this situation seems around the corner, not through the sheer numbers of immigrants arriving on the shores but through the rapid birth rates experienced in these cultural sub-communities.","time":1490163929,"resto":117730034,"id":"7NVNraLc","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":117730268,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)02:25:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117730225\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117730225<\/a><br><br>Individual feelings of cultural acceptance are destroyed, all in the name of the invisible doctrine of tolerance. How is it that this is advocated by the Left? What is shocking is that even if one rejects the philosophy I have outlined, that a society cannot exist without a dominant culture which all ascribe to, a society of multiple cultures is still unsustainable. Individuals vote emotionally, not rationally; and as the members of the formerly dominant culture feel like aliens in their own country they will turn to radical, anti-immigrant politicians and rhetoricians. For the immigrants, perhaps a disaster will occur. Hardly the image of tolerance, hardly the assertion of generosity, that the Left promises immigration is all about.","time":1490163957,"resto":117730034,"id":"7NVNraLc","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":117730777,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)02:32:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"black people and brown people are scum","time":1490164323,"resto":117730034,"id":"p8hb2Y4L","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117730971,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)02:34:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"Bump","time":1490164464,"resto":117730034,"id":"BOuomH6K","country":"IM","country_name":"Isle of Man"},{"no":117731125,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)02:36:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117730034\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117730034<\/a><br><a href=\"#p117730101\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117730101<\/a><br><a href=\"#p117730174\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117730174<\/a><br><a href=\"#p117730225\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117730225<\/a><br><a href=\"#p117730268\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117730268<\/a><br>big if true","time":1490164572,"resto":117730034,"id":"qyNuhfhf","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117731139,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)02:36:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117730777\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117730777<\/a><br>Wow, checked.<br>I guess they really are.","time":1490164583,"resto":117730034,"id":"7NVNraLc","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":117731168,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)02:36:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117730777\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117730777<\/a><br>Kek confirms","filename":"OyVey","ext":".jpg","w":2000,"h":3071,"tn_w":81,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490164601397,"time":1490164601,"md5":"LR8FmOTq+DmFrkC68wkb7A==","fsize":1181293,"resto":117730034,"id":"QENUjU5Q","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":117731385,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)02:39:06","name":"Anonymous","filename":"IMG_0616","ext":".jpg","w":707,"h":1000,"tn_w":88,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490164746371,"time":1490164746,"md5":"O0KmB8EzoqCURdhyAeeE6A==","fsize":172079,"resto":117730034,"id":"QJhS3HJP","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117731646,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)02:42:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117731168\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117731168<\/a><br>Extreme Racism here.<br>I&#039;ll probably get called &quot;kike&quot; or &quot;shill&quot; but what has happened to our nation?","time":1490164933,"resto":117730034,"id":"xqQHkzuP","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117731720,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)02:43:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"bump","time":1490164983,"resto":117730034,"id":"dflUNhWM","country":"EE","country_name":"Estonia"},{"no":117731809,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)02:44:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117731646\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117731646<\/a><br>GTFO shareblue shill we know exactly whats happening here","filename":"1489793791976","ext":".jpg","w":1020,"h":574,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1490165054886,"time":1490165054,"md5":"0mZKQfCGluVqAyCbo830vA==","fsize":291581,"resto":117730034,"id":"c6NGxr4V","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"}]}

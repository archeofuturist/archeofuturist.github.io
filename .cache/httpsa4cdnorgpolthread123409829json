(Luke 22:19).<br><br>In the Latin Rite, the bread for the Eucharist has been unleavened since the eighth century; that is, it is baked of flour and water without yeast. At the Last Supper, Christ probably took this kind of bread (mazzah), which was interpreted in the Passover memorial as a &quot;bread of affliction,&quot; the bread of nomadic shepherds who had no homeland of their own. During the first millennium of Church history, however, it was the general custom in both East and West to use normal &quot;daily bread,&quot; that is, leavened bread, for the Eucharist; the Eastern Churches still use it and usually have strict prohibitions against the use of unleavened bread (or &quot;azymes&quot;). The Latin Church, for its part, regards the question as of little importance, since at the Council of Florence, which sought to reunite East and West (1439), the difference in custom was simply acknowledged and accepted. (Rev. Johannes H. Emminghaus, The Eucharist: Essence, Form, Celebration, p. 161).<br><br>Cuckolics btfo","time":1493529931,"resto":123409829,"id":"adHWfI4V","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123441378,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)01:26:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123409829\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123409829<\/a><br>I have never seen communion passed out like that in a catholic mass ever.

Both churches have had there developments, centralization of the papacy in the west and caesero-papism and hesychast theology in the east but neither really view each other as heretical and I don&#039;t see very many unworkable dividing issues between the two. the schism may never fully be understood, for instance when mar-thomas Christians of the syraic rite re-established contact with Europe in the colonial period (after having been separated from the church since before the schism) even they quickly spilt along Catholic\/Orthodox lines trying to figure out which to reunify with. it&#039;s almost impossible to pick a side without exercising faith but it really doesn&#039;t matter what you choose considering they are both apostolic. the schism really falls on the heads of church authorities who let it happen.","time":1493532789,"resto":123409829,"id":"0ydxXZZR","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123445479,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)02:13:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123416528\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123416528<\/a><br>Single pack of Jesus&#039;s body and blood","time":1493532791,"resto":123409829,"id":"wx55p3R9","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":123445600,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)02:14:41","name":"Anonymous","filename":"fuckintinction","ext":".jpg","w":2016,"h":1134,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1493532881885,"time":1493532881,"md5":"vt+4rJAk6JGqpvMLeDDUHw==","fsize":874488,"resto":123409829,"id":"+CYIn7EJ","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":123445764,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)02:16:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123445168\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123445168<\/a><br><a href=\"#p123445351\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123445351<\/a><br>sometimes this is the only option tho, like either it&#039;s mcdonalds or you starve, wish the wrapper was plainer tho","time":1493532991,"resto":123409829,"id":"+CYIn7EJ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123445870,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)02:17:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123445764\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123445764<\/a><br>Gold or death <br><br>I wont live a pleb nor a goy","time":1493533060,"resto":123409829,"id":"6NLECe28","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123446080,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)02:20:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123445870\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123445870<\/a><br>can&#039;t bring gold monstrances into a prison, impractical to bring full gear to a beach or forest retreat...<br>gold or death? christ sez neither","time":1493533211,"resto":123409829,"id":"+CYIn7EJ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123446611,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)02:27:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123444960\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123444960<\/a><br>Orthodox use the KJV because it has the most accurate translations from original texts and it uses the greek septuagint for the OT.","time":1493533620,"resto":123409829,"id":"adHWfI4V","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123446664,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)02:27:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123445168\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123445168<\/a><br><a href=\"#p123445351\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123445351<\/a><br><a href=\"#p123445870\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123445870<\/a><br>How badly will it trigger you guys if I said the churches in my area have started using 2-in-1 cups to make thing simpler?","filename":"walkercc-2 (1)","ext":".jpg","w":256,"h":256,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493533660494,"time":1493533660,"md5":"fcIK89dLXEnuEo46+JEPiA==","fsize":13694,"resto":123409829,"id":"IHqOIxR6","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123446827,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)02:29:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123446664\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123446664<\/a><br>Then you probably aren&#039;t Orthodox","filename":"1493420718494","ext":".jpg","w":682,"h":960,"tn_w":88,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493533770194,"time":1493533770,"md5":"WEavB4EhwElN7+2e8WZRbQ==","fsize":84289,"resto":123409829,"id":"adHWfI4V","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123446854,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)02:29:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123446664\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123446664<\/a><br>is that sealed at the top? seems like itd be easy to spill","time":1493533787,"resto":123409829,"id":"+CYIn7EJ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123447118,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)02:33:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123446854\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123446854<\/a><br>They get handed around on these trays <a href=\"#p123445600\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123445600<\/a><br><br>They&#039;re really fuckin&#039; tiny.

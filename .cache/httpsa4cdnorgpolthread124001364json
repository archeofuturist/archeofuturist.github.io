Commies want to try and make a utopia that is shaped by their agenda, its just that first they have to shoot a bunch of people, starve a bunch of people, establish an authoritarian dictatorship, etc. Instead of having them force their beliefs on all of us, wouldn&#039;t it be best to allocate some remote location on the earth and isolate them completely? That way all the commies can move there and starve to death on their own without fucking up everyone else&#039;s day. <br>This solves both sides problems. Commies get to try out their dumb ass ideas without fucking everyone else over. We can find an island somewhere and just drop them off there via some sort of rotary aircraft. <br>What do you think \/pol\/?","filename":"LOLCOMMIES","ext":".jpg","w":480,"h":480,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493863218882,"time":1493863218,"md5":"mvys6K9mPZDrc9Sismfucw==","fsize":27670,"resto":0,"id":"WTNOduV9","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"why-dont-communists-fuck-off-to-an-island","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":124002648,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)22:11:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124001364\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124001364<\/a><br>Which deserted Island has room to support hundreds of millions?","time":1493863895,"resto":124001364,"id":"SZDML4by","country":"AT","country_name":"Austria"},{"no":124002762,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)22:12:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124001364\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124001364<\/a><br><br>because at it&#039;s core communism takes from others. a mess of commies on an island wouldn&#039;t have anything to take.","time":1493863962,"resto":124001364,"id":"ctlKWLzt","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

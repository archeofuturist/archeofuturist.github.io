Kay Ivey today signed into law a bill allowing adoption agencies in Alabama to follow faith-based policies, such as not placing children with gay couples.<br><br>&quot;The elected legislature of this state overwhelmingly approved House Bill 24. Having served as President of the Senate for more than six years, I appreciate the work of the legislature, and I agree with it on the importance of protecting religious liberty in Alabama,&quot; Ivey said.<br><br>The House of Representatives last week gave final approval to the bill by a vote of 87-0, with six abstentions, concurring with a change the Senate made when it approved the bill.<br><br>&quot;I ultimately signed House Bill 24 because it ensures hundreds of children can continue to find &#039;forever homes&#039; through religiously-affiliated adoption agencies. This bill is not about discrimination, but instead protects the ability of religious agencies to place vulnerable children in a permanent home,&quot; the governor added.<br><br>Rep. Rich Wingo, R-Tuscaloosa, the sponsor of the bill, said the purpose was to make sure that faith-based agencies are not at risk of being forced to close because of decisions based on their beliefs.","filename":"gayadoption","ext":".jpg","w":2000,"h":1000,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493859495417,"time":1493859495,"md5":"8L0uqNBkH4gYgNKGPer0Aw==","fsize":507935,"resto":0,"id":"v956mbJB","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"alabama-governor-signs-antigay-adoption-bill","country_name":"United States","replies":18,"images":7,"unique_ips":12},{"no":123994282,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)21:01:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123993935\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123993935<\/a><br>Thank Christ.

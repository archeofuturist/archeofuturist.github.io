He was an outspoken critic of the Soviet Union and communism and helped to raise global awareness of its Gulag forced labor camp system. He was allowed to publish only one work in the Soviet Union, One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich (1962), in the periodical Novy Mir. After this he had to publish in the West, most notably Cancer Ward (1968), August 1914 (1971), and The Gulag Archipelago (1973). Solzhenitsyn was awarded the 1970 Nobel Prize in Literature &quot;for the ethical force with which he has pursued the indispensable traditions of Russian literature&quot;. Solzhenitsyn was afraid to go to Stockholm to receive his award for fear that he would not be allowed to reenter. He was eventually expelled from the Soviet Union in 1974, but returned to Russia in 1994 after the state&#039;s dissolution.<\/span><br><br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Aleks<wbr>andr_Solzhenitsyn<br><br>Why would the works of a titan of literature not be almost universally translated?<br><br>Well, About the book<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Alexander Solzhenitsyn, who first exposed the horrors of the Stalinist gulag, is now attempting to tackle one of the most sensitive topics of his writing career - the role of the Jews in the Bolshevik revolution and Soviet purges. <\/span><br>In his latest book Solzhenitsyn, 84, deals with one of the last taboos of the communist revolution: that Jews were as much perpetrators of the repression as its victims. Two Hundred Years Together - a reference to the 1772 partial annexation of Poland and Russia which greatly increased the Russian Jewish population - contains three chapters discussing the Jewish role in the revolutionary genocide and secret police purges of Soviet Russia.","filename":"28008677","ext":".jpg","w":315,"h":475,"tn_w":165,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493260317702,"time":1493260317,"md5":"apVGeUuRWpJvxUNSCdcgWQ==","fsize":18131,"resto":0,"id":"C3y7uYEX","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"most-banned-book-in-the-world","country_name":"United States","replies":5,"images":1,"unique_ips":4},{"no":122981486,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)22:33:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122981331\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122981331<\/a><br>The book has no official English translation.

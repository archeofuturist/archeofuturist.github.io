Period.","com":"The health care bill should be a mandated Health Savings Account, deducted from paychecks like the social security tax. Cap it at $10000 for the young, and graduate it upwards as you age. Separate, catastrophic plans optionally available from the free market, which will by it&#039;s nature will be very cheap. If you need more, and you didn&#039;t plan ahead, you lose your house and savings as God intended, but you either pay the hospital bill or go to a halfway house until you work it off.<br>The only .gov involvement is the law about the paycheck deduction. But unlike social security taxes, it doesn&#039;t go to the government, it goes to an account in your name. Just like a retirement account, no taxes until it&#039;s used, and then only if it&#039;s not used for medical expenses.<br>Not ideal, but this means I don&#039;t have to pay for the people who put an iphone and data plan ahead of anything else.","filename":"jeremiah-wright","ext":".jpg","w":198,"h":145,"tn_w":198,"tn_h":145,"tim":1490679907636,"time":1490679907,"md5":"O8DIQElf24SxBphSDPjN8A==","fsize":9596,"resto":0,"id":"VNPiRQrf","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-only-workable-obamacare-replacement-plan","country_name":"United States","replies":8,"images":7,"unique_ips":4},{"no":118617774,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)01:49:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118617350\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118617350<\/a>","filename":"3402934","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":500,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490680175829,"time":1490680175,"md5":"j10tHTNX5X5MMSilGUEcAA==","fsize":101470,"resto":118617350,"id":"VJSmfa7F","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118619219,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)02:06:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118617350\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118617350<\/a><br>Why mandate the savings account?

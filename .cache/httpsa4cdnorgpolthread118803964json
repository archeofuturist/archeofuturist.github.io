How many is it? anyone? anyone? It&#039;s 10. There&#039;s 10 10s in 100. So you see, there are also ten tens in 135, so we&#039;ll just take those away, and now we have ten tens here and ten tens there. Now how many tens are left in 35? anyone? anyone? there&#039;s only 3 you see because there isn&#039;t a whole ten left in 5. Okay, so now you have 10 10 s and 10 more 10s and then 3 10s, can anyone tell me how many tens that is? anyone? anyone? it&#039;s 23 10s. now how many is that in ones? anyone? anyone?<br><br>etc. you get the picture.

Mom thought it was strange that PacMan would eat small ghost people.. and my Dad wouldn&#039;t defend me because he just simply hates games.. so yea i hope that sets the tone of my childhood..<br><br>When i i got older my mother died from cancer, i was 14 i think (not sure) It was hard on me and my dad, but my dad took the worst of it, it was honestly a very hard time in our life.<br><br>So i&#039;d say a month after she died we got this strange phone call to our house phone and my dad wen&#039;t to go pick up the phone, and i just remember after he answered that call his face was white as shit dude... that horrific look on his face i can&#039;t get out of my mind, so i ofc asked what was wrong and he told me to not answer the phone and then he unplugged it. I didn&#039;t bother to ask why.. because he didn&#039;t seem like he wanted to talk, so like a few hours later my dad wen&#039;t to the store to buy a couple things so i stayed home and watched tv, then all a sudden i heard the house phone ringing like wtf i thought he unplugged it, but i just assumed he hooked it back up.<br><br>So i ofc answered the phone and it sounded like my mother was talking or like as if someone but dialed on accident.. but i couldn&#039;t make out what was being said, but i heard.. i love you.. i love you.. i love you i love you in this creepy ass fucking manner, and i hanged up, and it gave me massive chills i didn&#039;t think it was demonic at the time, but it really had me going<br><br>One sec i&#039;ll continue the story. sorry for taking so long. gotta split it up","time":1493594353,"resto":123539208,"id":"TdZ4K97d","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123543274,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)19:23:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123542873\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123542873<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;open the door<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;walk the jew<\/span>","time":1493594580,"resto":123539208,"id":"8nOcA15x","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123543297,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)19:23:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123542873\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123542873<\/a><br>Whoa.

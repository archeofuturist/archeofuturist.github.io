But law enforcement in those cities are purposefully relaxed on immigrants and will not give them up to federal authority.<br><br>Now, obviously the federal government can&#039;t deploy the national guard or whatever and force them to comply. The only way this would be possible is if it was a severely problematic case and they let them go free because &quot;muh immigrants.&quot; <br><br>So then the next logical option is to enact economic sanctions for failing to follow federal guidelines. Since we are talking cities, it&#039;s not difficult to pressure them into it and withhold federal funds. Again, it isn&#039;t the federal government that declares them sanctuary cities, it&#039;s the liberal run local governments that declare themselves sanctuary cities.<br><br>In my opinion the federal government has every right to do this.

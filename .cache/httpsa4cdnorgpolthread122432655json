If you dont mind the seasons( hot and hotter) its very beautiful. If youre gonning to live there, nigger are a problem. I&#039;m not talking to shit on black, but Mississippi niggers are the niggyest nigger in the south. South find the white counties. In my opinion, gulf coast and river counties the the most accountable. One of the best features is that the dollar goes faaarrr. You can build a 700K home in Texas for 150K in Mississippi. The nigger cities, like Jackson, are very corrupt, so that make it had to do business there. Didnt alway be like that. Back in the 60s Jackson, the white city that johnny cash sang about, what a booming proud capital city. Now that the blacks voted in their corrupt and economicly retarted nigger mayor, its destroyed the economy and skyrockected crime triggering white flight. So to answer your question (besides blacks): it gets hot.","filename":"ms-flag","ext":".jpg","w":615,"h":417,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":84,"tim":1492960978414,"time":1492960978,"md5":"PQjpcmfDZmw9bmjAHjT66g==","fsize":53247,"resto":122432655,"id":"tYOZp9hg","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122436629,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)11:28:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122432655\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122432655<\/a><br>Roaches fucking everywhere and the niggers there are the lowest niggest niggers that ever nigg&#039;d.

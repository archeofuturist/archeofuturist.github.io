Atheism is in decline worldwide, with the number of atheists falling from 4.5% of the world&#039;s population in 1970 to 2.0% in 2010 and projected to drop to 1.8% by 2020, <br><br>Real surveys and statistics say atheism is on the decline worldwide. Sorry atheists but atheism is not on the rise nor is it winning. It&#039;s still the minority and a declining one at that. <br><br>The Pew Research Center&#039;s statistics show that atheism is expected to continue to decline all the way into 2050 with a continued growth of religion. Other research also shows a huge surge in growth for Christianity in China which is currently the world&#039;s most &quot;atheist&quot; nation because of the atheist communist government suppressing religion, the research suggests that China will soon become the world&#039;s most Christian nation within 15 years. <br><br>This is simply history repeating itself: Christianity prospered in Rome back in the ancient era when it was suppressed and it still grew in the militant atheist soviet Russia when it was suppressed there only a century ago with the majority of Russians today now also identifying as Christian. Just goes to show that atheist suppression of religion still doesn&#039;t stop religion.<br><br>Sources for the legion of whiny \/Redditor\/ fedoras that will no doubt show up it this thread:<br><br>http:\/\/www.pewforum.org\/2015\/04\/02\/<wbr>religious-projections-2010-2050\/<br>http:\/\/www.pewforum.org\/2012\/12\/18\/<wbr>global-religious-landscape-unaffili<wbr>ated\/<br>http:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/news\/wor<wbr>ldnews\/asia\/china\/10776023\/China-on<wbr>-course-to-become-worlds-most-Chris<wbr>tian-nation-within-15-years.html<br>http:\/\/masterrussian.com\/russia\/fac<wbr>ts.htm","filename":"1490142549767","ext":".jpg","w":608,"h":755,"tn_w":201,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491778035193,"time":1491778035,"md5":"gbLQR\/M\/TdWWLU+dYjIA+Q==","fsize":123410,"resto":0,"id":"fsToK0+R","country":"PL","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"atheism-is-the-fastest-shrinking-religion-in-the","country_name":"Poland","replies":8,"images":3,"unique_ips":7},{"no":120351072,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)18:49:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120350765\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120350765<\/a><br>Posting an edited image seems unnecessary.","time":1491778185,"resto":120350765,"id":"RAkxzurd","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120351107,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)18:50:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120350765\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120350765<\/a><br>nice. only fat fuck fedoras are atheists","time":1491778201,"resto":120350765,"id":"IXoXep+k","country":"BE","country_name":"Belgium"},{"no":120351165,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)18:50:26","name":"Anonymous","filename":"1491776473466","ext":".jpg","w":2100,"h":1500,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":89,"tim":1491778226523,"time":1491778226,"md5":"O8fcqtpG15cWxN7FRW4tOw==","fsize":578876,"resto":120350765,"id":"Hg4YKbuh","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":120351180,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)18:50:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120350765\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120350765<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/new<wbr>s\/acts-of-faith\/wp\/2016\/04\/21\/my-wi<wbr>fe-and-i-are-white-evangelicals-her<wbr>es-why-we-chose-to-give-birth-to-bl<wbr>ack-triplets\/<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;My wife, on the other hand, grew up in the delta of Mississippi and it wasn\u2019t until she took a few trips to Haiti that the veil of racial prejudice was lifted from her eyes<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;we informed the agency that we were willing to accept any child except a fully Caucasian child.

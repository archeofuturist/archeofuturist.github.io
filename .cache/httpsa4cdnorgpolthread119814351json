He debunks overpopulation, is anti-marxist, and knows overpopulation is a myth. He also got in trouble for not using proper &quot;PRONOUNS&quot;. If you ask me and my friends we all consider him a God, treat him as a God, and give him so much respect he basically is a God to us. Sometimes we call him God as a joke but sort of mean it. Jorden Peterson is who we respect and don&#039;t disagree with. Can we discuss his positions in the thread?","filename":"peterson","ext":".jpg","w":850,"h":567,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1491521139877,"time":1491521139,"md5":"O7nws6B1FnD2D5fp1EtcpA==","fsize":53240,"resto":0,"id":"7xhC021Z","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"jorden-peterson-thread","country_name":"Canada","replies":5,"images":1,"unique_ips":3},{"no":119814535,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)19:26:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119814351\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119814351<\/a><br>He&#039;s becoming a whore.<br><br>Besides that he&#039;s fine.","time":1491521212,"resto":119814351,"id":"AYLeZKZc","country":"CL","country_name":"Chile"},{"no":119814590,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)19:27:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;Think hard about what you want to say, say it neatly and organized, then stand by it.

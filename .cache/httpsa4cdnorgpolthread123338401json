While in the 1860s they may have been worried of European invasion on the heels of the civil war, or the French in Mexico starting something, by the 1870s we were very much secure and happy to just move westward and keep Brits\/Canadians out of Oregon. We certainly were not going to be sending any troops to the European continent while still basically in the age of sail, and German troops in America would only slightly speed up Manifest Destiny.","time":1493477804,"resto":123338401,"id":"DgMWdjwF","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123340715,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)10:58:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;whites killed each other off so niggers and chinks could rule over them<\/span>","time":1493477907,"resto":123338401,"id":"u3Bl\/HFd","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

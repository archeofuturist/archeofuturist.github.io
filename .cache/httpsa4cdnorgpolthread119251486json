The documents indicate that the CIA also had the ability to create an appearance of \u2018false attribution\u2019 which gives the impression that the malware was created by another country; including Russia or China. The Mirror reported that: \u201cMarble has test examples in Chinese, Russian, Korean, Arabic and Farsi as well as English.\u201d<br><br>Wikileaks claimed that Marble was in use at the CIA during 2016 and reached 1.0 in 2015. This raises serious questions in regards to the \u201cRussian Hacking\u201d narrative often proposed by representatives of the American intelligence community and in the press regarding the U.S. presidential election of 2016.<br><br>Conservative candidate Guillermo Lasso has promised to revoke Assange\u2019s asylum within \u201c30 days\u201d of election, if he is is elected. Opposing Lasso is Len\u00edn Moreno, who has indicated he will allow Assange to remain in the Ecuadorian embassy if victorious. The race has so far been reported as very close, with some Latin American media reporting that polls lean slightly in favor of Moreno.<br>Although U.S. President Donald Trump has commented favorably on Wikileaks, the U.S. Department of Justice has remained silent on claims it has readied a secret indictment of Assange, which Wikileaks has referred to as \u201cunconstitutional.\u201d","filename":"Screen Shot 2017-04-02 at 4.53.12 PM","ext":".png","w":828,"h":461,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":139,"tim":1491170199740,"time":1491170199,"md5":"X2nvORgsr1PekDimqEiesQ==","fsize":212051,"resto":0,"id":"cH91zfQz","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"wikileaks-press-release-on-the-program-alleges","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":119251677,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)17:58:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"Assange Senpai needs our help","time":1491170301,"resto":119251486,"id":"cH91zfQz","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119251680,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)17:58:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"do we have exit polls yet?","time":1491170304,"resto":119251486,"id":"FKJIWJHa","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

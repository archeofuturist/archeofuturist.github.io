The Air Strike was a waste of taxpayer money. Assad and Russia are still conducting attacks where the gas attack happened. Basically $94 million wasted for Trump to feel like a tough guy, guess he missed out when he dodged the draft.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Assad gassed his own people, Trump had to do something<\/span><br>According to who? The (((media)))? (((Mossad)))? Call me crazy but maybe the people who use child suicide bombers did it. Also why is Syria the responsibility of the US? Why are we policing the world again like 2003? The only people who benefit from this are ISIS and (((them))).<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;No one can call Trump a Russian agent now<\/span><br>Wrong. The House and Senate investigations are still ongoing. The house panel has a new chairman after Nunez proved to be compromised. I guess that&#039;s what Trump gets for trusting a spic. The FBI is also investigating Flynn, Manafort and the globalist cuck (((Kushner))). This Air Strike doesn&#039;t change what happened in the past, that&#039;s not how time works. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Trump showed China he&#039;s a tough guy<\/span><br>Yeah Trumps a real tough guy. Conducting a strike during a meeting with the Chinese was super beta. Trump showed how insecure and desperate he is for good PR. The Chinese were not impressed and the Chinese press is calling Trump a insecure little faggot. <br><br>All of you unprincipled fanboys can keep sucking the cock of your lel epic meme president. Those of us with self respect will continue to call you out for the hypocrites you are. By attacking Assad and keeping Obmamacare in place, Trump is now no different than Hillary. You and the poor white trash who supported Trump got played hard by (((them))).","filename":"standwithrand","ext":".jpg","w":240,"h":240,"tn_w":240,"tn_h":240,"tim":1491716049637,"time":1491716049,"md5":"TtyQ+p+5gtg0TPt4hTM\/Bw==","fsize":10483,"resto":0,"id":"t2DTMIRF","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"debunking-trumptards","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":1},{"no":120245293,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)01:39:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"bump","time":1491716385,"resto":120244714,"id":"t2DTMIRF","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

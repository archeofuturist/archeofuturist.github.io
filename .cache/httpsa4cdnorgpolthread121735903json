Cryptocurrencies rise; equities fall! POTUS touts &quot;Buy American, Hire American&quot; in Wisconsin; Ghost discusses foreign policy. Inforwars&#039;s Alex Jones admits he&#039;s a &quot;performance artist&quot; under oath in court. Cleveland Facebook killer Steve Stephens dead from apparent suicide. In April, Theresa May calls for special general election in June. Turkey votes in favor of referendum to give Erdogan more power. US F-22s intercept Russian bombers off Alaska coast. And Venezuela&#039;s Maduro to expand armed civilian militia. Ghost goes off on light skinned versus dark skined Black racism within the Black community.

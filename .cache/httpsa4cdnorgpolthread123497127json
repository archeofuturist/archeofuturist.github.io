Small businesses, competitive markets, all these things contribute to the way for the poor to become wealthy.<br><br>Ergo, they must be destroyed. Small businesses are made illegal by restrictions and laws that only the pre-existing large corporations can actually adhere to. To depress wages and wipe out worker&#039;s rights, flood the county with massive amounts of third world, unskilled men.<br><br>Things such as racial or national identity keep traditions alive, and create a reinforcing structure that makes people care about eachother and work together to make a better life for their society as a whole. These need to be erased and replaced, or you can&#039;t get rid of the nation state.<br><br>We are in the process of seeing wealth from the larger countries re-distributed to smaller countries, with the burden of employment re-distributed to larger countries. An EU army is also being made, which is great since you can oppress one country with the army of another state, to remove all potential for revolt.<br><br>It, like most things today, is just an extension of the same thing - anything that makes people truly content or happy with their existence must be destroyed, because that doesn&#039;t make George Soros rich.<br><br>Would a minority of elites destroy the human race&#039;s entire future for a lifetime of hedonism?

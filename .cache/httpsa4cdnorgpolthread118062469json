Recognizing the fundamental importance of transparency to enable consumers to make informed purchasing decisions, we require carriers to provide privacy notices that clearly and accurately inform customers about what confidential information the carriers collect, how they use it, under what circumstances they share it, and the categories of entities with which they will share it. We also require that carriers inform their customers about customers\u2019 rights to opt in to or opt out (as the case may be) of the use or sharing of their confidential information. We require that carriers present their privacy notice to customers at the point of sale, and that they make their privacy policies persistently available and easily accessible on their Web sites, applications, and the functional equivalents thereof. Finally, consistent with FTC best practices and with the requirements in the CPBR, we require carriers to give their customers advance notice of material changes to their privacy policies.)<br><br>6.

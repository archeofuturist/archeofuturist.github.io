Unlike other aircraft that carry a finite LOX (liquid oxygen) supply, the F-22 has an &quot;On Board Oxygen Generating System&quot; (OBOGS). Previously if OBOGS malfunctioned intermittently, the pilot could not detect if it was imperceptably generating insufficient oxygen, and thereby cause the pilot to develop a slow onset of hypoxia that could lead to blackout before anything could be remedied. The solution was to issue a retrofit contract to add finite LOX units configured with an oxygen sensor to automatically dispense oxygen if it detects OBOGS is not providing enough. The retrofit contract was done two years ago and there&#039;s been no hypoxia incidents for over two years.","filename":"Fifth-generation-aircraft-F-22-Raptor","ext":".jpg","w":2000,"h":1351,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":84,"tim":1492531225683,"time":1492531225,"md5":"5urMYwVsVukzS5dW\/KUu+w==","fsize":226831,"resto":121695098,"id":"1+iRnjzz","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":121700384,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)12:02:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121696310\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121696310<\/a><br>Another happy landing","filename":"hqdefault (1)","ext":".jpg","w":480,"h":360,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1492531356119,"time":1492531356,"md5":"94pxAZvPQKiz\/bzKlcHTTA==","fsize":12642,"resto":121695098,"id":"qpymBSAD","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121700471,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)12:03:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121699541\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121699541<\/a><br>I haven&#039;t read of one.

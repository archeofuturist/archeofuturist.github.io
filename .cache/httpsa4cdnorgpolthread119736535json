But as Theresa May prostrates Britain before her head-chopping friends in Saudi Arabia, her strategy is clear. Abandoning the vast single market across the Channel doesn\u2019t just mean reducing Britain to the status of lapdog to the woman-groping Muslim-bashing demagogue across the Atlantic. It means an ever-closer relationship to regimes which inflict suffering on people inside and outside their own borders.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;At the beginning of last year, Saudi Arabia slaughtered dozens of people on the grounds they were \u201cterrorists\u201d, an Orwellian use of the term which extended to the state murder of dissident Shia cleric Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr. Demonstrating just how prepared our government already is to challenge Saudi atrocities, the former British ambassador claimed that some of these executions were understandable. Here is a regime which \u2013 just like the extremists it helped to spawn \u2013 slices off the heads of dissidents and gays. It treats women as the inferior possessions of men: a suffocating oppression that will not be swept away by May\u2019s patronising claims to arrive as a female role model. It is pounding neighbouring Yemen with British bombs: thousands of civilians have been murdered in the offensive, and millions have been driven from their homes in what has become one of the world\u2019s gravest humanitarian crises. It invaded Bahrain in 2011 to defend the ruling autocratic family from protests for democracy. It exports an extremist ideology which threatens the security of people in this country. And yet May\u2019s strategy is to use Brexit to forge an even great bond with these fanatical gangsters.<\/span>","filename":"IMG_1765","ext":".jpg","w":750,"h":656,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":218,"tim":1491480872118,"time":1491480872,"md5":"QLayC3ylYo5eSHgdiuUdag==","fsize":90306,"resto":0,"id":"6g3uNTw5","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"sips-tea","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":2,"unique_ips":1},{"no":119736674,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)08:16:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Another beneficiary of May\u2019s Brexit strategy is Turkey. This is somewhat ironic given Turkey was a demonic presence in last year\u2019s referendum: the leave campaign poisonously and dishonestly claimed the country would imminently join the EU and gain freedom of movement across the European continent. Turkey is a country fast degenerating into dictatorship: since a failed coup last July, tens of thousands have been arrested or purged from their jobs, media outlets have been closed down, and senior opposition figures thrown in jail. This doesn\u2019t bother our esteemed prime minister though: she pledged a \u201cnew and deeper trading relationship with Turkey\u201d in January, consummated with a \u00a3100m fighter jet deal.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Then there\u2019s Israel, its hard-right government emboldened by Donald Trump\u2019s ascendancy. Despite the UN security council describing all settlements as illegal, Israel has committed itself to expanding them. The first settlement in two decades has just been approved: an unapologetic form of colonisation which will render any peace deal impossible. Government ministers openly question the loyalty of Arab Israeli citizens. The occupation itself is enforced by brutality, racism \u2013 and also western complicity. But \u2013 as a recent state visit from Benjamin Netanyahu underlined \u2013 May is using Brexit to deepen Britain\u2019s embrace of his human rights-abusing government, rather than push for a just peace for Israelis and Palestinians alike.<\/span>","filename":"IMG_1766","ext":".jpg","w":1400,"h":788,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1491480984787,"time":1491480984,"md5":"6rS2FWyVUHRpUuKQFpg\/uQ==","fsize":160202,"resto":119736535,"id":"6g3uNTw5","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":119736779,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)08:17:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;So there we have it. A Tory Brexit is not \u201ctaking back control\u201d, it is surrendering it to the Donald Trumps, the Saudi dictators, the Turkish autocrats, the Israeli hardliners. Meanwhile, the rest of the world mocks us as we debate the colour of our passports and talk about war with Spain. Yes, for too long British foreign policy has been subordinate to the United States, guilty of involvement in disastrous wars, and loyally supportive of murderous foreign governments. May\u2019s Brexit strategy could make all of these things so much worse. Just look at our prime minister, genuflecting to tyrants who believe in chopping off people\u2019s heads.

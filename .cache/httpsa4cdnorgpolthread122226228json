Further studies are underway to address the cultural norms and customs that may be playing a role in the reporting style of caregivers, as observed by the ADI. Accurate determination of the ASD phenotype in the Amish is a first step in the design of genetic studies of ASD in this population.<\/span>","filename":"Consider_the_Following","ext":".png","w":685,"h":958,"tn_w":89,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492833503999,"time":1492833503,"md5":"HNGZSc5WeZxxDPfGORxA8g==","fsize":400668,"resto":122226228,"id":"7GVDGbLS","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122232658,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)23:59:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122232548\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122232548<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;http:\/\/ghr.nlm.nih.gov\/condition\/m<wbr>aple-syrup-urine-disease<\/span><br>I&#039;m dying.<br>Fuck who ever coined that name.","time":1492833574,"resto":122226228,"id":"+IXcB6jc","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122232676,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)23:59:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122230982\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122230982<\/a><br>And tar and feathered all whilst being flogged with wet rope(multipurpose =))","time":1492833585,"resto":122226228,"id":"0LQ4FGwK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122232740,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)00:00:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122226603\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122226603<\/a><br><a href=\"#p122229684\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122229684<\/a><br>Nope. repeated studies found no connection and the guy that originally wrote the article was debunked. <br><br>Hell, if you know anything about rigor then the original report reads like a fucking joke.","time":1492833627,"resto":122226228,"id":"OO097DJg","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122232863,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)00:01:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122232284\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122232284<\/a><br>http:\/\/www.nvic.org\/NVIC-Vaccine-Ne<wbr>ws.aspx","time":1492833702,"resto":122226228,"id":"CmCn5liP","country":"JP","country_name":"Japan"},{"no":122233088,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)00:03:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122232863\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122232863<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;No forced vaccines.<\/span><br>So, have you ever heard of confirmation bias?","filename":"1470390661517","ext":".jpg","w":776,"h":452,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":72,"tim":1492833832040,"time":1492833832,"md5":"rREK\/lxWCQ2rGIjfbaQU7g==","fsize":210288,"resto":122226228,"id":"+IXcB6jc","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122233150,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)00:04:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;yeah of course diet soda is fine, goy<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;oh, turns out it gives you alzheimer&#039;s and a shit load of other terrible shit.

But, the good ones don\u2019t ever want to organize, the bad instead are the ones that organize, because they lust after power. Powerful consciences don\u2019t want to dominate other people, they want to empower them, so they don\u2019t tend to get together until things are really late in the game, then they come together. Evil is always defeated, because good is so much stronger. And, we\u2019re on this planet and Einstein\u2019s physics showed it, Maxwell\u2019s physics showed it, all of it, that there is at least twelve dimensions, and now that\u2019s why all the top scientist and billionaires are coming out saying it\u2019s a false hologram, it is artificial. The computers are scanning it and finding tensions points where it is artificially projected and gravity is bleeding in to this universe, that\u2019s what they call dark matter. So, we\u2019re like a thought or a dream that\u2019s like a wisp in some computer program, some god\u2019s mind, whatever. They\u2019re proving it all, it\u2019s all coming out. <br>Now, there\u2019s like this sub transmission zone below the third dimension that\u2019s just turned over the most horrible things, which is what it resonates to, and it\u2019s trying to get up into the third dimension, that\u2019s just a basic level consciousness to launch into the next levels. And our species is already way up to the fifth, sixth dimension consciously, our best people. But there is this big war trying to like, basically destroy humanity, because humanity has free will, and there is a decision to which level we want to go to. We have free will, so evils will have to contend, not just good.","filename":"alex","ext":".jpg","w":311,"h":413,"tn_w":188,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492006542256,"time":1492006542,"md5":"oaWAfUiLlnnrSqregbMlZw==","fsize":26649,"resto":0,"id":"qAvg+gVP","country":"NO","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-elite-are-all-about-transcendence-and-living","country_name":"Norway","replies":5,"images":0,"unique_ips":6},{"no":120759905,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)10:17:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"#woke","time":1492006648,"resto":120759736,"id":"fAsxJtWj","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120759938,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)10:17:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120759736\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120759736<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;So, we\u2019re like a thought or a dream that\u2019s like a wisp in some computer program, some god\u2019s mind, whatever.<\/span><br>I do everytime at this bit lmao Love alex","time":1492006668,"resto":120759736,"id":"18gDMWrI","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120760192,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)10:20:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;when you swallow the whole bottle of redpills<\/span>","time":1492006818,"resto":120759736,"id":"aSztHUvT","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":120761390,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)10:31:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120759736\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120759736<\/a><br>why would anyone want to live forever though...

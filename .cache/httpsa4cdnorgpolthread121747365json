The search warrant was issued by a Clerk Magistrate of the Quincy District Court after police received a credible report that the occupant of 50 Doane Street had numerous unsecured rifles and shotguns strewn about his house. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The occupant of the home is a 65-year old male who lives alone. Detectives are still interviewing him and no charges have been filed at this point. The man does have a license to possess riffles and shotguns, which was revoked by the Cohasset Police Chief today. All of his weapons have been seized. This case remains under investigation by the Cohasset Police.<\/span><br><br>https:\/\/cuckbook\/permalink.php?stor<wbr>y_fbid=1466219473420307&amp;id=17214072<wbr>6161528","filename":"17884376_1466219300086991_1612091016624022835_n","ext":".jpg","w":960,"h":772,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":201,"tim":1492552610556,"time":1492552610,"md5":"w53kI+MIQ\/c7ATgfxjqHHg==","fsize":203620,"resto":0,"id":"KcTXRrn+","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"gun-confiscation-in-massachusetts","country_name":"United States","replies":27,"images":7,"unique_ips":23},{"no":121747663,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)17:59:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121747365\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121747365<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;be Americuck<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;can&#039;t own gun<\/span>","filename":"1463303693800","ext":".jpg","w":250,"h":241,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":120,"tim":1492552747096,"time":1492552747,"md5":"kb9qEhycZ99ed2iWvo+8Kg==","fsize":11775,"resto":121747365,"id":"NiZ9UInT","country":"CH","country_name":"Switzerland"},{"no":121747823,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)18:00:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;license to possess<\/span>","filename":"434663463467","ext":".jpg","w":597,"h":410,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":85,"tim":1492552820592,"time":1492552820,"md5":"m9BvVdoQz0b45vrMP8KXlw==","fsize":52877,"resto":121747365,"id":"qGaZwi3Q","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121747835,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)18:00:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"everyone knows the only way to be safe is a house rigged with live grenades and shotguns.","time":1492552825,"resto":121747365,"id":"VX+Dkc1l","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121748053,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)18:01:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121747365\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121747365<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;mASSachusetts <\/span><br>Stay cucked east coast","time":1492552906,"resto":121747365,"id":"9JJEhfX5","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121748103,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)18:02:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121747365\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121747365<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;no charges have been filed<\/span>","time":1492552930,"resto":121747365,"id":"Dd0PE3aA","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121748122,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)18:02:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121747365\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121747365<\/a><br>That poor Browning auto 5. :(","time":1492552940,"resto":121747365,"id":"WKMvjCL+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121748207,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)18:03:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121748103\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121748103<\/a><br>Just a seizure of private property :^)","time":1492552980,"resto":121747365,"id":"FHGxWTKH","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121748528,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)18:05:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121748053\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121748053<\/a><br>Pennsylvania is mini Texas when it comes to guns fuck off.","time":1492553138,"resto":121747365,"id":"WKMvjCL+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121748565,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)18:05:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"We&#039;re gonna protect the second amendment folks.

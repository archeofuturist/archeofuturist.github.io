The search warrant was issued by a Clerk Magistrate of the Quincy District Court after police received a credible report that the occupant of 50 Doane Street had numerous unsecured rifles and shotguns strewn about his house. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The occupant of the home is a 65-year old male who lives alone. Detectives are still interviewing him and no charges have been filed at this point. The man does have a license to possess riffles and shotguns, which was revoked by the Cohasset Police Chief today. All of his weapons have been seized.

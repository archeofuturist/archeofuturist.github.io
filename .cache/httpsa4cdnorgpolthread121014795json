Yes, M.O.A.B. is an acronym, meaning Mother Of All Bombs. But beyond this mere superficiality, what does M.O.A.B. represent? What is the symbolism behind the most power non-nuclear bomb ever used in war? <br><br>Let&#039;s us refer to the Bible. In the Bible, we often hear of the Land of Moab. Moab, and its people, the Moabites, had entered a war of the Israelites - the contemporary Jews. Though we find that Israel had friendly relationships with Moab, that soon ended forever. The Israelites went to war with Moab. The war ended with a decisive Israelite victory, and Moab became a tributary of Israel. <br><br>What was Moab is now Jordan, which shares a border with Syria. It is also within the boundaries of Greater Israel. The end times are upon us. They began with the re-establishment of Israel, and they will likely follow through until Greater Israel has been achieved. <br><br>Keep this in mind, \/pol\/. The world is governed by symbols, and M.O.A.B. is a symbol of what is to come in the Middle East. Israel guides the hand of the United States.","filename":"Biblical Kingdoms","ext":".png","w":720,"h":859,"tn_w":209,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492142367708,"time":1492142367,"md5":"A85tld3MxOlfYRNp+uHvmQ==","fsize":166719,"resto":0,"id":"c6hdF5tL","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"symbolism-of-moab","country_name":"United States","replies":12,"images":2,"unique_ips":10},{"no":121015101,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)00:02:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"this is creepy","filename":"1486850676684","ext":".jpg","w":444,"h":332,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1492142541802,"time":1492142541,"md5":"vzWfXNqFHhp5Dxj+tEISyw==","fsize":14560,"resto":121014795,"id":"BHrQn8Gy","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121015316,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)00:04:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121014795\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121014795<\/a><br>This is straight up bullshit.

That&#039;s the best you can muster? Kinder surprise eggs are by far the most autistic fucking chocolate I&#039;ve ever had the chance to lay teeth on, even by looking at the inside you can already tell how Kinder totally jews each and every customer by making it hollow, creating the illusion of a rich creamy center but instead it&#039;s just a second layer It also tastes like shit. But how could I forget the &quot;Best part&quot; of the egg! The surprise, what is it? It&#039;s like some bullshit fucking piece of plastic that has instructions to do jack shit. I&#039;m holding one right now in my hand and it&#039;s like 2 parts of a single body. It&#039;s honestly worth less than 1 single cent. That&#039;s how worthless this shit is. Also did I forget to mention that they&#039;re a choking hazard? That&#039;s right! The little fat fuck retard that actually buys this thing is feeling hungry and feels like choking to death this easter! Well I wouldn&#039;t stop him! One less piece of shit to deal with am I right?<br><br>Oh yeah forgot to mention that the CEO of Kinder donated like 2 million dollars to Jeb&#039;s campaign. I&#039;ll just leave it to that.<br>Also, search up &quot;Kinder Surprise Egg&quot; On Youtube, you&#039;re gonna get some really cool results. Kinder makes good bars though, fucking love that shit.","filename":"1413986922341_wps_6_Stock_picture_of_drugs_in","ext":".jpg","w":634,"h":442,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":87,"tim":1492518105634,"time":1492518105,"md5":"QgbokHlqtRFIHcVnoxLYaA==","fsize":60628,"resto":121671715,"id":"3wnfUDXz","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":121678403,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)08:23:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121677631\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121677631<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;not thinking min wage workers are important<\/span><br>NEET DETECTED","filename":"^229067265845A703DAB36AA6537C09F0C77C86967DF43A6363^pimgpsh_thumbnail_win_distr","ext":".jpg","w":230,"h":164,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":89,"tim":1492518196684,"time":1492518196,"md5":"Z+XznoKxZMWylAlG3H86xA==","fsize":8370,"resto":121671715,"id":"HcINkjON","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121679095,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)08:30:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121678403\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121678403<\/a><br><br>You&#039;re important but you re the one of less value<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Leftist detected<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Salty worker<\/span>","time":1492518649,"resto":121671715,"id":"xbXC0haA","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":121679447,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)08:34:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121678257\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121678257<\/a><br><br>You&#039;re triggered hard you<br><br>There were also a bigger egg but I should take it just to trigger you more","time":1492518898,"resto":121671715,"id":"xbXC0haA","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":121679752,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)08:38:26","name":"Anonymous","filename":"1492127553086","ext":".jpg","w":259,"h":194,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1492519106566,"time":1492519106,"md5":"GZdVzaH7Rsg7DCRvHLGuCw==","fsize":10996,"resto":121671715,"id":"oaEZz0Wh","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121679836,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)08:39:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121675513\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121675513<\/a><br>nice keyboard my nigga","time":1492519171,"resto":121671715,"id":"K7o4vMh9","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"}]}

The writer, who&#039;s articles and columns about video games, comic books, and MMA earned him a reputation as &#039;the man who invented being funny on the internet&#039;, has been getting increasingly SJW in recent years, praising Hillary Clinton and calling Donald Trump a rapist on twitter. But until now it hasn&#039;t affected his writing. <br><br>So much for that, his latest comic book edit is an incoherent mess. The villain is written as an alt-right character as understood by a man whose only understanding of what&#039;s &#039;alt-right&#039; is secondhand knowledge gained from other cracked writers, and the fantastic four are also spewing faux-nazi talking points because...he thought that worked somehow? Gone are the brilliantly crafted metaphors, seeming the work of a more profane Hunter S. Thompson, and present are a bunch of random, scatological, puerile non-sequiturs. It&#039;s like Amy Schumer got Freaky-Friday&#039;d into his Seanbaby&#039;s body and tried to recreate the Leather Special in internet column form. <br><br>Seanbaby&#039;s finally lost it. Press F to pay respects or S to spit on grave, whichever feels right to you.","filename":"Capturesb","ext":".png","w":1021,"h":662,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":162,"tim":1491927073775,"time":1491927073,"md5":"c8tSKA\/OyFYP0rzYboPZNA==","fsize":373325,"resto":0,"id":"JBpP7lBk","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"well-its-official-seanbaby-isnt-funny-anymore","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":120616840,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)12:23:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"That&#039;s sad to hear.

The two precursors to sarin probably got released after their containers were blown open by explosives and formed sarin, which then spread into the town. Since the MSM couldn&#039;t admit that the Syrian rebels were producing (and using, as has been documented in some cases) sarin gas, they&#039;ve covered up what facility was bombed and are pretending it was a chemical attack on civilians. <br><br>The Occam&#039;s Razor position is that he bombed a chemical weapons factory. The other argument is that Assad secretly kept secret weapons after the UN and US monitored his destruction of reserves back in 2013, Assad sat on his weapons for 4 years and decided to use them now even though he is winning the war handily and all it would do is give him bad publicity and risk a Western intervention.<br><br>Literally the only way Assad could lose power is if the West intervenes against him. The only reason Trump would do that is if Assad did something totally heinous, like maybe a chemical weapons attack. That&#039;s why the (((MSM))) is desperate to pretend Assad did a chemical weapons attack.","time":1491505392,"resto":119777540,"id":"yqNv8U6d","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119778604,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)15:06:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"Shouldn&#039;t you be worried about a houthi scud finding its way up your ass more than what&#039;s happening in syria?","time":1491505561,"resto":119777540,"id":"B+34aGKC","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119778892,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)15:08:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119778604\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119778604<\/a><br>I live in the middle of buttfuck nowhere in the UAE and honestly I&#039;m sick of this place and all the people in it, I&#039;m a britbong really - so the chances of an attack hitting me are incredibly low and I really couldn&#039;t care less if it hit anywhere else in the country.","time":1491505706,"resto":119777540,"id":"h0B0YfoD","country":"AE","country_name":"United Arab Emirates"},{"no":119778951,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)15:08:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119777540\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119777540<\/a><br>Theyve attempted fakes countless times.

Everyone in the plant could have paid in roughly a years worth of their wages and owned the place outright with a combined purchasing power of roughly 14 million after taking out a 45k loan or a combination of loan and savings. The plant sold for roughly this amount. Many of my coworkers had vehicles worth more than their yearly wage and virtually everyone had disposable income to invest and decent enough credit to get a loan. Every single person I talked to liked the idea but ultimately wouldn&#039;t even entertain the idea of this plant being an employee owned business. <br><br>Another company bought out the plant, reduced wages and benefits and are selling it again for a nice profit. The working class are not entrepreneurs. These same coworkers that could have least kept their previous salary in quarterly profit distribution and at best made double or more weren&#039;t above bitching when the evil capitalists came in reduced virtually all compensation for our work. It was infuriating to listen to the whining. <br><br>I suspect this is more than anecdotal and applies to most of the population. They can&#039;t be bothered to form workers syndicates that own the production.

The main cause of tooth plaque is from the bacteria that&#039;s the natural flora in your mouth. Some people have more aggressive species, and are more susceptible to tooth decay, while others are resistant. Tooth decay is from bacteria in your mouth taking the food from your daily meals as nutrients and breaking it down into energy and acid, which corrodes your teeth. The reason tooth brushing is important is because it breaks up and removes stray food particles in your teeth, thus starving the bacteria in your mouth. <br><br>Pro tip: Once you&#039;re a grown adult, you don&#039;t need toothpaste. Toothpaste is only effective for children who haven&#039;t brushed very much. Here&#039;s why: Your teeth are made of hydroxyapatite, which is susceptible to acid. When you toss fluoride into the hydroxyapatite, it creates a layer of fluorapatite over your teeth, which is resistant to acid. Once all your teeth are coated, you just need to maintain that layer to keep healthy teeth, which is brushing regularly. <br><br>Also, alcohol based mouthwash is a meme. First of all, using alcohol doesn&#039;t create superbugs. The reason people write down &quot;so and so kills 99.9% of germs&quot; is because there are spots the alcohol can&#039;t reach, such as the gaps in your teeth. The only thing the alcohol does is cause your mouth to dry out, which is very bad for oral care.","time":1492293621,"resto":121264335,"id":"d3TBgbaQ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121268585,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)18:03:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121268234\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121268234<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Your teeth are made of hydroxyapatite<\/span><br>No you idiot.

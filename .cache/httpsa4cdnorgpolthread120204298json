If you literally think the American military is in Syria due to outrage over crimes against humanity and not as part of a geopolitical chess game, I feel sorry for you. Please don&#039;t be the type of person that sees a Syrian child crying on CNN and thinks an American bombing campaign will cheer them up.<br>At 30 seconds; &quot;up until now, the US has only been fighting ISIS&quot;, is beyond wrong. If the inorganic CIA\/twitter\/mercenary\/ jihadist origins of this conflict are brushed aside, that&#039;s still wrong. I suppose nobody in need of a run-down from Vox has a clear memory of the last time the CNN war drums were beating for a bombing campaign in Syria in response to a depressingly contrived &quot;Assad regime sarin gas attack&quot;. This video mentions that the American fleet, in position to bomb Assad, was forced to abandon their plans by a Russian fleet threatening confrontation is their ally Assad was attacked. This video makes no mention of that incident at all, but essentially what Trump is doing now was scheduled for 2012.","filename":"cc53fcb7fc47ad0891199cc4934e49ddb3b1553a34bd5587b1a3e71eaee43c41","ext":".jpg","w":750,"h":499,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1491695996746,"time":1491695996,"md5":"NShG2qFKUYb6F0bx5d94Xw==","fsize":69453,"resto":120204298,"id":"8xZ7bTsh","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]}

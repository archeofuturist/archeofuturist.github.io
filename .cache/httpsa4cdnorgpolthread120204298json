If you literally think the American military is in Syria due to outrage over crimes against humanity and not as part of a geopolitical chess game, I feel sorry for you. Please don&#039;t be the type of person that sees a Syrian child crying on CNN and thinks an American bombing campaign will cheer them up.<br>At 30 seconds; &quot;up until now, the US has only been fighting ISIS&quot;, is beyond wrong. If the inorganic CIA\/twitter\/mercenary\/ jihadist origins of this conflict are brushed aside, that&#039;s still wrong. I suppose nobody in need of a run-down from Vox has a clear memory of the last time the CNN war drums were beating for a bombing campaign in Syria in response to a depressingly contrived &quot;Assad regime sarin gas attack&quot;. This video mentions that the American fleet, in position to bomb Assad, was forced to abandon their plans by a Russian fleet threatening confrontation is their ally Assad was attacked. This video makes no mention of that incident at all, but essentially what Trump is doing now was scheduled for 2012.","filename":"cc53fcb7fc47ad0891199cc4934e49ddb3b1553a34bd5587b1a3e71eaee43c41","ext":".jpg","w":750,"h":499,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1491695996746,"time":1491695996,"md5":"NShG2qFKUYb6F0bx5d94Xw==","fsize":69453,"resto":120204298,"id":"8xZ7bTsh","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120204881,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)20:01:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"The implication around 1:00 that there was one single united Syrian rebel faction called the Free Syrian Army until the maniacal dictator Assad deliberately infused the rebellion with jihadists is cartoonish. There have been a myriad of infighting rebel factions since day 1, and to this day I&#039;m unaware of one that is not jihadist. America directly arms, funds, and trains specific rebel groups that film themselves beheading children in the street, this is no exaggeration. <br><br>The claim at 4:30 that the Americans only funded and trained rebels who fight ISIS, not Assad, is absolutely outlandish. Go have a look at what happened to all of Assad&#039;s tanks, they were smashed with brand new, extremely expensive TOW missiles they could only have got from America.<br>Thanks for admitting at 1:50 that the Saudis and gulf states export Wahhabiism and fund jihadists, that was pretty mature of you. American funding suspiciously omitted. Remember that rebel training program the Americans ran in Turkey, where the trained rebels had a 100% defection rate to ISIS immediately after entering Syria? I wonder where those rebels got all those shiny new American TOW missiles, and that Texan plumber&#039;s truck!","time":1491696102,"resto":120204298,"id":"8xZ7bTsh","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120205184,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)20:04:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"bump","time":1491696267,"resto":120204298,"id":"TXi79CqK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120205562,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)20:07:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"At 4 mintes it was claimed that ISIS doesn&#039;t attack Assad \u2026 explain the battles of Palmyra and Dier ez Azor then\u2026 You know who ISIS really suspiciously doesn&#039;t attack? Israel! Somehow ISIS managed to pop up on both sides of Israel in Syria and Sinai simultaneously, and they haven&#039;t laid a finder on Israel to date, odd for jihadists! Perhaps it has something to do with the well documented treatment of Syrian jihadist rebels in Israeli hospitals, the Israeli bombing of Assad&#039;s positions (also omitted from this video), and the Israeli annexation of the Syrian Golan heights?<br>Turkey&#039;s role in bombing the Kurds in Turkey is horrifically brushed over, just look at how that&#039;s worded! Turkey, an aspiring EU member and current Nato member and American ally, is bombing its own citizens! Gassing his own kurds is literally the single worst thing Saddam Hussein did, and that was grounds for a massive war, but Turkey gets a free pass! Turkey&#039;s direct funding of ISIS through massive oil purchases was also omitted. Turkey feverishly denied this until the Russians released hours of aerial footage of these ISIS oil convoys travelling into Turkey, the convoys are so massive! Have a look for yourself.","filename":"a78d00e3515b8c46724d1b5eb21d19049c7059256fd231b1aacdbaf66721d592","ext":".jpg","w":685,"h":668,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":121,"tim":1491696463852,"time":1491696463,"md5":"AHIWSzbsIoodpN\/BAFbZHg==","fsize":72959,"resto":120204298,"id":"8xZ7bTsh","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120205947,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)20:10:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"At about 5:15 this video falsely claims that Russia&#039;s stated goal was to bomb ISIS but instead bombed rebels. Russia&#039;s stated intent was to bomb terrorists, and they sure did bomb terrorists, US-funded terrorists included.<br>This last gas attack is fake news, straight up. Literally not even the first time they tried this exact trick on the drooling masses. The 2013 attack was found by a UN investigation to have almost certainly been committed by jihadist rebels, this didn&#039;t recieve very much American coverage though, hmmm\u2026 I wonder why? It doesn&#039;t even make sense this time, why would Assad, at the tail end of a log and hard-fought war that is finally turning in his favour, just as the US president states that they&#039;re no longer seeking his removal, decide to commit such a heinous and grizzly crime against his own people? Not even combatants mind you, but just random women and children of his own country! This is strategically suicidal and you would have to believe him to be a cartoon character to think he would do such a ridiculous and horrible thing intentionally, gaining absolutely nothing and losing any diplomatic advantage he&#039;d previously had, for the satisfaction of a random murder?

This is an obvious false flag. America loves to go to war in aggression, and to help Israel expand, but it always has to be framed as a defensive manoeuvre. From the spanish-american war (the maine) to the vietnam war (tonkin) to the first iraq war (incubators) and second iraq war (WMD), the Americans always need to portray to the proles at home that they&#039;re heroically fighting against cartoonish sadistic evil baddies. If this had anything to do with crimes against humanity, America would be having a word with its gay-hanging, child-beheading woman-oppressing, clitorus-chopping, own-citizen-bombing, armenian genocide-denying friends and allies. They&#039;s likely also starting giving a hoot about the ratio of civilians to combatants killed in their drone-bombing campaign in Pakistan, you wanna start talking about little kids crying on TV about their dead parents you can start there... sheesh.","filename":"74a1cf6496cdf9a268f11b664fb7b0b23f514566c23d8406da55ceb5f3b303db","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":765,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1491697277778,"time":1491697277,"md5":"EYWu3mdJq7zh0P0Ud8ZASA==","fsize":207911,"resto":120204298,"id":"8xZ7bTsh","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120209591,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)20:40:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"self bump<br><br>come on you lazy retards I know you have nothing better to do, this will be great","filename":"6c0847a7dedc9f468d856759fa1943c6ef48edba7004c1c626f655d102904f66","ext":".jpg","w":590,"h":452,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":95,"tim":1491698411936,"time":1491698411,"md5":"WBG61nZul8BaIs7TwTiQ5A==","fsize":34970,"resto":120204298,"id":"8xZ7bTsh","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]}

In an ancap system the people have effectively divided themselves. Any organized group seeking to subvert the ancap society and slowly manipulate people out of their land and resources can now do so with ease because the people who make up this society are motivated entirely by their personal interests and have no means of maintaining social cohesion. A large population without a state, no matter how intelligent or well-armed, cannot last because their uninhibited selfishness will provoke them to sell their property to the highest bidder, turning the whole ancap territory into a giant live auction.","time":1492912943,"resto":122349702,"id":"uib92fWB","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122362735,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)22:02:59","name":"Anonymous","filename":"hoppe","ext":".jpg","w":606,"h":427,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":88,"tim":1492912979142,"time":1492912979,"md5":"++m7Ur5q8JtwyrSkwW1Fww==","fsize":150417,"resto":122349702,"id":"AHSY7wRx","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122362817,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)22:03:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122362554\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122362554<\/a><br><br>Hoppe is nice, but he can also be a fucking retard.","time":1492913024,"resto":122349702,"id":"O5OyNqOV","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122362915,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)22:04:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122362817\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122362817<\/a><br>Spotted the atheist faggot","time":1492913082,"resto":122349702,"id":"c7PEUGRS","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":122362936,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)22:04:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122362735\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122362735<\/a><br><br>It could be argued that labor is a commodity like anything else, and restricting the flow of labor is restricting the flow of goods and services.","time":1492913092,"resto":122349702,"id":"O5OyNqOV","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122362967,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)22:05:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122362554\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122362554<\/a><br><a href=\"#p122362229\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122362229<\/a><br>If you want to build a commune in Ancapistan no one will stop you, but the second you try to impose it on anyone who doesn&#039;t want it or prevent anyone from leaving who doesn&#039;t want it anymore you run afoul of NAP.","time":1492913106,"resto":122349702,"id":"AHSY7wRx","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122363049,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)22:05:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122362109\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122362109<\/a><br>Not ultimately <br>My goal would be being with my all white family with no nogs and die happily because the root of all evil will be down<br>But if I end up with a classical liberal who hates niggers as president (pic related)...meh better than nothing","filename":"image","ext":".jpg","w":1200,"h":800,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1492913143954,"time":1492913143,"md5":"OUyDhqcoVPw4AA8bYMRcDg==","fsize":165445,"resto":122349702,"id":"BXpwkyKt","country":"FR","m_img":1,"country_name":"France"},{"no":122363061,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)22:05:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122362915\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122362915<\/a><br><br>What the fuck does that have to do with it? <br><br>I&#039;m a protestant, btw.","time":1492913152,"resto":122349702,"id":"O5OyNqOV","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122363071,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)22:05:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122362636\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122362636<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;It doesn&#039;t own all land.<\/span><br><br>The government allows the vast majority of land to be privately owned because that&#039;s just what makes sense in terms of economics, but it still needs to reserve certain parcels of land for government functions.

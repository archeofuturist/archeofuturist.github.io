But Trump still went ahead with the attack anyway.<br>Do you recall earlier in the day when Russia, Syria and Iran bent the knee?<br>Trump could&#039;ve stopped the conflict right then and there, but he didn&#039;t.<br>He continued to carry out the attack, despite the mass outcry! He looked like a madman to everyone, was he going to start World War III over a false flag?<br>Well, of course he wouldn&#039;t because you know that the God&#039;s Chosen plays 45D Poker, and he&#039;s got the best face around.<br>Look at his behavior throughout the press conferences leading up to, and after the stikes.<br>He has some of the most powerful opposition countries bending the knee, while having dinner with the Sleeping Dragon. No doubt Trump and XiPing made quite a comfortable few deals, possibly even building the road to the end of the CCP.<br>So, he&#039;s got every foreign power, friend and foe right where he needs them to be, and he strikes anyway. Not just a few strikes, 59 tomahawk missiles (which I&#039;m sure you know is fucking overkill for some delapitated Syrian air base).<br>He did a pre-op to make sure no Russians were in the base, and as far as we know, Moscow hasn&#039;t released anything.<br>So the entire media pressures him into &quot;taking action&quot; stopping this &quot;genocide&quot; in Syria.<br>You don&#039;t think he knows that this was all (((their))) work, and is clearly a test of his power levels. His mentor was Cohn.

I lived on Tongatapu for a bit at a military base. The marines would be sitting around drinking kava, playing guitar and singing every night. A lot of the island is quite poor but families produce probably more than half of their own food. They have pigs and dogs roaming freely around the villages, they eat both. There&#039;s coconuts and fruits fucking everywhere and they don&#039;t really seem to belong to anyone in particular. It would be impossible to starve there.<br><br>They don&#039;t have good rubbish collection infrastructure, so you find big piles of trash in the bush on the main island. Which is sad to see.<br><br>They have a strong family culture and are very christian. They have no western fast food outlets, I think their king has banned them.<br><br>The land is incredibly fertile but they don&#039;t really bother to farm it, I guess they&#039;re happy just being well fed and not chasing the dollar. There are coconut plantations which used to make them a bit of coin, but the price dropped considerably and they didn&#039;t adapt. Island time is a real thing, they just relax. You can take a bus and the driver will literally stop to buy an ice cream.<br><br>In the military base they had a fleet of new shiny busses and cars gifted by the chinese government, but instead they used this old ass american bus. They had plastic chairs free floating in the back of their army trucks, a marine fell off the back of one and died at one point. The marines couldn&#039;t shoot for shit, I think they hardly ever get live rounds. They&#039;d unzero their rifles during practice just to get some more of ours. The range ended at a cliff into the sea, we had to have sentries out to look for boats coming into the area, and we stopped firing for a bit because whales were jumping around in the beaten zone of a couple of machine guns.

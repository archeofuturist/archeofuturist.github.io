In general, research with regard to marijuana use and respiratory health has been more consistent than research on marijuana use and cardiac or metabolic illnesses.<br><br>Respiratory Problems<br>A recent review suggests that marijuana smokers tend to experience a greater number of respiratory problems than nonsmokers (e.g., chronic bronchitis, wheezing, cough), although there is no evidence that marijuana use is related to airflow obstruction or emphysema (Tashkin, 2013). For example, one longitudinal study found that frequent marijuana use across adolescence and young adulthood was associated with an increased risk of experiencing respiratory problems (e.g., sore throat, shortness of breath) at age 27, even after controlling for age, gender, childhood aggression, adolescent major depressive disorder, parental education level and income, and maternal marijuana use (Brook, Stimmel, Zhang, &amp; Brook, 2008). However, this study did not control for co-occurring tobacco use or the presence of respiratory problems (e.g., asthma) prior to the onset of regular marijuana use. In a cross-sectional study, researchers found that current marijuana users were more likely to report having chronic bronchitis, cough, phlegm production, wheezing, and abnormal breath sounds (without a cold) than non-using controls, and this effect remained after accounting for the effects of gender, age, current asthma, and tobacco cigarettes used per day (Moore, Augustson, Moser, &amp; Budney, 2005).","time":1492412049,"resto":121481540,"id":"V3eIf+Bf","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121493649,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)02:54:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121493090\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121493090<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;everyone should do what they want, because they like it!<\/span><br>Nice strawman you fucking faggot.

One cross-sectional study found a dose-dependent relationship between the frequency of marijuana use (use in the past 30 days) and several cardiometabolic risk factors (e.g., elevated fasting glucose and insulin, triglycerides, systolic and diastolic blood pressure; Vidot, Arheart, Prado, Hlaing, Acheampong, &amp; Messiah, 2015). In addition, a case-crossover study of patients who suffered from a myocardial infarction found evidence that marijuana use may have triggered the attack in a small number of patients (Mittleman, Lewis, Maclure, Sherwood, &amp; Muller, 2001), potentially because of the acute effect that marijuana use has on heart rate. However, one longitudinal study found no evidence that adolescents and adults (ages 15-49) who frequently used marijuana were at increased risk for experiencing an adverse cardiovascular event (e.g., heart attack, stroke) or developing coronary heart disease across a 10-year follow-up (Sidney, 2002). Moreover, one large-scale cross-sectional study (N = 39,695) of adults found that past and current marijuana users were actually less likely than nonusers to be diagnosed with diabetes, a well-established risk factor for cardiovascular disease (Rajavashisth et al., 2012).","time":1492412219,"resto":121481540,"id":"V3eIf+Bf","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121494189,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)02:59:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121493090\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121493090<\/a><br>you havent refuted a single post of mine except to label me with names.<br><br>plz discuss my first post<br><br>and as a curtesy i dont run around in public screaming that shit everyday. i dont spam facebook. i stick to my dark corner of the net with my unrefutable fax. if u wana look all shilly, i can happily improve my composure and articulate to normies. it would be against my ideology and religion, but i would do it if youre really an uncle sam shill (;","time":1492412367,"resto":121481540,"id":"S5NerOWt","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121494380,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)03:01:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121481540\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121481540<\/a><br>Here&#039;s a good rule to live your life by: <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;if niggers do something, you shouldn&#039;t do it<\/span><br>100% of niggers smoke weed.

Scytho-Sarmatians are closely related to Slavs and afterAttila the Hun the remnants mixed with the forest-dwelling Venedic tribes, giving rise to the modern Slavs. The border between the Italo-Celto-Germanic peoples, and the old Scytho-Sarmatians (a nomadic warrior race, while the Venedi were semi-nomadic farmers) is the border between Centum and Satem languages of today.<br><br>In antiquity historians seemed to put emphasis that the Greeks and Scythians used to be related, but they differed in language over time.<br><br>Also, Scytho-Sarmatians elongated their skulls through skull-binding, just like royal lines and warrior tribes did literally all over the world (although one in Africa which still practiced this in the early 20th century, in Congo, claimed descendancy from Sudan and before that ancient Egypt). Even in Melanesia a tribe was found practicing this 100 years ago, they claimed descendancy from the Middle East. <br><br>Native Americans tell of tribes of cannibal giants with red hair, the mound builders, that lived there before they came.","filename":"easter island nephilim","ext":".jpg","w":982,"h":1176,"tn_w":104,"tn_h":124,"tim":1490121724575,"time":1490121724,"md5":"yS80iSTutCoMn\/rmBPSpHA==","fsize":379540,"resto":117650996,"id":"uFUMP\/x3","country":"BE","m_img":1,"country_name":"Belgium"},{"no":117655322,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)14:47:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"Flavius Josephus, Jewish historian in early Imperial Rome, writes about the fallen angels, repeating the Book of Enoch narrative to a certain extent, and he also says that the gods of Greek mythology, the Titans and the Gigantes, were the Nephilim.<br><br>In the Book of Enoch they refer to the giants as the &quot;heros of old, men of renown&quot;, which refers to Hercules, Gilgamesh, Og, Perseus etc...<br><br>They really existed.

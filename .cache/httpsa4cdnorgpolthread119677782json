However he seems so analytical he sometimes disappears down the wrong rabbit hole - he talks about the alt-right, but seems to identify it as exactly the same as white nationalism - he ignores the men&#039;s rights people, gamergate, traditionalist Catholics, free speech militants, Libertarians, general populists, red pilled atheists and others who are committed to rolling back the liberal machine. The pool of people who actively supported Donald Trump is even broader - including the Zionist Jews.<br><br>I know the brand &#039;alt-right&#039; is increasingly owned by Richard Spencer as he claims it and the liberal media wants to associate it with Nazis. But it wasn&#039;t always like that, and it seems to be a tactic with the left to associate a brand with Nazism and then try and past it on even the most moderate free speech advocate.<br><br>Does Sargon ultimately help?

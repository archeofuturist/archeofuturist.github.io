The debt ceiling is a bit arbitrary, usually congress just raises it after they hit it. However if the US accumulates so much debt that it can&#039;t make loan payments, then the US has a problem. The first problem will be with creditors. Need to buy military equipment? Better get used to waiting, because no one is going to lend the money to the US government at a reasonable rate. Inflation will increase, as people will start to lose faith in the US economy, causing the prices in the US to raise. This means that citizens will have a harder time purchasing necessities like food. The next problem will set in after a few missed payments. Creditors will start to take collateral. Depending on the loan deal depends on the collateral taken. Next, when America can no longer pay its bills, government service staff will start to stop working, because turns out they need to be paid. Miss enough payments on debt and your economy becomes like Zimbabwe, that is why keeping US debt under control matters.","time":1492068006,"resto":120878639,"id":"YMZHWdRa","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]}

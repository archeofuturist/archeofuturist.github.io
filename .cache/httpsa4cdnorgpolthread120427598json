Firstly it was older Americans who voted for him, 40 y.o and above were above 50% for Trump, they do not listen to your memes. People making under 50K a year were more likely to vote for Hillary, above for Trump- so most neets and internet nerds actually voted for Hillary and working people for Trump, again you did not persuade them or if you did it was the other way around. Similarly conservatives voted for Trump, Liberals for Clinton- guess who probably spends more time on social media and lewd websites looking at memes? Liberals I would say with confidence. So seriously, what people do you actually think you affected to tip the election? Rural working class conservative middle aged whites?

Given that Canada is a relatively small country, and there had been (at least in theory) a ton of foreign capital wanting to invest, there was supposedly near-infinite demand for Canadian housing in its big cities.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;This foreign money theory has come under scrutiny. 2016 revealed that in some cases there were fewer foreign buyers of Canadian housing than expected, and the domestic speculative streak runs stronger than had been realized. Besides, the Chinese government is taking further efforts to slow capital outflows. We&#039;ve already seen significant signs of strain in various overseas markets where Chinese money laundering provided the marginal bid for the asset.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Regardless of the source, speculation rapidly reversed in 2016 within Vancouver. The market went from boom to bust inside of a year following passage of a foreign buyers tax. Sales are down as much as 40% year\/over\/year, and prices are now moving lower as well.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Now Ontario is following in Vancouver&#039;s footsteps, rolling out a similar tax on foreigners. On top of that, newly-proposed rent control policies would potentially make a large portion of newly-constructed Toronto condos perpetually cash flow negative after paying interest. That would be a major problem going forward. The greater Toronto area&#039;s housing market is still booming for the moment, but if Vancouver serves as a guide, this market could quickly retreat.<\/span><br><br>YASSS","time":1493747201,"resto":123788211,"id":"rmTgjlSK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123793812,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)13:46:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"Threaded reminder that banks can be (((solid as a rock))) but it doesn&#039;t matter.

The draft legislation provides a framework for the conversion of certain eligible shares and liabilities of the D-SIB into common equity of the bank (or any of its affiliates) in the event the D-SIB becomes non-viable.

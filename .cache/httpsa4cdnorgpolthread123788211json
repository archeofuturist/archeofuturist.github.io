Besides, the Chinese government is taking further efforts to slow capital outflows. We&#039;ve already seen significant signs of strain in various overseas markets where Chinese money laundering provided the marginal bid for the asset.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Regardless of the source, speculation rapidly reversed in 2016 within Vancouver.

Sales are down as much as 40% year\/over\/year, and prices are now moving lower as well.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Now Ontario is following in Vancouver&#039;s footsteps, rolling out a similar tax on foreigners. On top of that, newly-proposed rent control policies would potentially make a large portion of newly-constructed Toronto condos perpetually cash flow negative after paying interest. That would be a major problem going forward. The greater Toronto area&#039;s housing market is still booming for the moment, but if Vancouver serves as a guide, this market could quickly retreat.<\/span><br><br>YASSS","time":1493747201,"resto":123788211,"id":"rmTgjlSK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123793812,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)13:46:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"Threaded reminder that banks can be (((solid as a rock))) but it doesn&#039;t matter.

The draft legislation provides a framework for the conversion of certain eligible shares and liabilities of the D-SIB into common equity of the bank (or any of its affiliates) in the event the D-SIB becomes non-viable.

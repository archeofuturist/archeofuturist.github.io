Oh wow they are going after gangbangers and pedos. A couple hundred guys a week, its so much winning I can&#039;t contain it. Meanwhile probably thousands flooded into this country this week.<br><br>The deportations need to ramp up tenfold, twentyfold, or even more before I give a fuck. Read about Operation Wetback. THAT is what the feds are capable of doing but Trump is choosing not to because he is controlled.<br><br>You have nothing to say, no argument to make. The truth is 368 people is laughably low, just a drop in the water. It is a betrayal of his promise. <br><br>Face it.<br><br>Besides leftist kevetching, I have not seen proof of mass deportation. As much as i want to get rid of &quot;bad hombres&quot;, criminal aliens only account for 20% of illegal aliens. ICE is only targeting criminal aliens and aliens with deportation orders, leaving no resources for sweeps or employer sanctions. <br><br>With the resources spent tracking down one bad hombre, ICE could have went to 50 construction sites and netted thousands of illegals. <br><br>But they don&#039;t. Heck, even Kelly and Sessions admitted that ICE does not engage in sweeps or other indiscriminate arrest practices. <br><br>To get rid of 10 million illegal aliens in 4 years, ICE needs to arrest an average of 7K a day. They are not only nowhere near that but aren&#039;t even trying. <br><br>The nature of immigration enforcement demands indiscriminate arrests. <br><br>I&#039;m disappointed in Trump because immigration was the biggest reason I voted for him.","filename":"IMG_8043","ext":".png","w":584,"h":573,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":245,"tim":1491747973418,"time":1491747973,"md5":"w563nauTReXIjI3d0gV9Xg==","fsize":86641,"resto":0,"id":"1Iscm2L2","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"is-trump-winning-in-immigration","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":120287566,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)10:28:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120287383\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120287383<\/a><br><br>In the old INS days, you would read newspaper headlines showing that hundred of illegal aliens were arrested in one day - AT ONE BUSINESS or FARM. <br><br>These piecemeal ICE fugitive ops serve only to make ICE officers justify a pay increase and make them feel like cops.","time":1491748108,"resto":120287383,"id":"HPg6JPSv","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120287654,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)10:29:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120287383\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120287383<\/a><br>Well most muricans here are edgy teens from r-the donald although i apreciate your post its a bit much to take for their little brains....","time":1491748158,"resto":120287383,"id":"A6oEZTCW","country":"RO","country_name":"Romania"}]}

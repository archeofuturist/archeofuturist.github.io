The disgusting Goblins were using propaganda and pictures of young Orcs to get the morally conscious Elves to feel bad for them and welcome them in. The Orcs begin to act Orcish in the homeland of the Elves, taking it over. The Goblins use their power in the far western lands to have the Humans want to take in Orcish refugees also, using their evil Goblin powers to brainwash the Human and Elvish youth, while the domesticated Orcs and Gremlins (Mexicans) cause internal strife within the Western Kingdom. Then, one Human, a king born with a great golden crown, kind of looks like a wig, steps from the ashes and promises to fix it all. But it turns out gets brainwashed by the Goblins lol. <br>The Orcs are coming.","filename":"orc_child_baby_face_by_tallymai_chan-d65f8dk","ext":".png","w":227,"h":437,"tn_w":129,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492288160247,"time":1492288160,"md5":"mxstkyJA08RHPzUJ\/SISLQ==","fsize":75399,"resto":0,"id":"trUEDLGD","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"imagine-if-elves-were-to-take-in-orcish-refugees","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

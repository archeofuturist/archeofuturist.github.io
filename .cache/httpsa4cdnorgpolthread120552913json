A good portion of the population won&#039;t even view his decisions as being valid seeing as he has the double whammy of being nominated by a President who was so resoundly defeated in an election and also effectively stole the seat from another justice. His name will always have an asterik next to it, nominated by unpopular President who lost popular vote, took seat from another gentleman, ANd didn&#039;t even manage to break the 60 vote threshold that most justices get when confirmed.

This is a weapons-grade redpill for most normal people, and a very useful read for those of us who already are aware of these topics and want to read an analysis by a conservative philosophy professor.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;If reality is nothing but a \u2018narrative,\u2019 then of course it\u2019s important to control what people say.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;One force behind the new wave is a theory of truth, or a picture of reality, developed the first time around. This theory, which we might call \u201clinguistic constructivism,\u201d holds that we don\u2019t merely describe or represent the world in language; language creates the world and ourselves.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;[Richard Rorty] had many ways of deflecting the charge of relativism. But perhaps it is more notable that his \u201cconsensus reality\u201d was to be achieved through telling stories. He held that reality was a matter of widely accepted narratives\u2014in particularly narratives of social progress.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u201cIt is doubtful whether the current critics of the universities who are called \u2018conservative intellectuals\u2019 deserve this description,\u201d Rorty writes. \u201cFor intellectuals are supposed to be aware of, and speak to, issues of social justice.\u201d That is, opponents of the leftist consensus in academia do not even count as intellectuals because of the positions they take. By that logic it is defensible to eliminate such people from graduate programs, to deny them tenure, even to shout them down.<\/span><br><br>Discuss.<br><br>https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/the-po<wbr>stmodern-intellectual-roots-of-toda<wbr>ys-campus-mobs-1490394294","filename":"BN-SQ378_sartwe_GR_20170324124019","ext":".jpg","w":1242,"h":810,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":163,"tim":1490638371038,"time":1490638371,"md5":"cvb5tamwEHR9X0ZqnQHCEQ==","fsize":125163,"resto":0,"id":"z8WKKkTQ","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-postmodern-intellectual-roots-of-todays","country_name":"United States","replies":3,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":118541096,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)14:21:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;To Read the Full Story, Subscribe or Sign In<\/span><br>REEEEEEEE<br>http:\/\/archive.is\/6F980","time":1490638896,"resto":118540021,"id":"AB6YY0gI","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118541241,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)14:22:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"I guess you morons are all too busy in your slide threads to respond to a clear analysis of your opponents&#039; main ideology.","time":1490638965,"resto":118540021,"id":"z8WKKkTQ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118541908,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)14:27:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"bump","time":1490639266,"resto":118540021,"id":"z8WKKkTQ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

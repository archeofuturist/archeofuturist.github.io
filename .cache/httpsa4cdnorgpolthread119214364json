We are slightly between a rock and a hard place (hope that is the phrase) because most jews think of christians as just being arabs and hence bad but most arabs are muslim and don&#039;t like christians. That being said, there is a growing realisation, looking around at the region, that Israel is actually a good place to be a Christian. There is even a movement of people who want to not be called &#039;Arabs&#039; but &#039;Arameans&#039; to dissassociate from the Palestinians. In terms of pracitising faith, wearing a crucifix etc. I have never had a problem.

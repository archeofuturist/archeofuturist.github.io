It can give you the disinhibition to talk to someone new with perhaps more ease than normal, but it&#039;s not going to help you establish lasting friendships.

And some people are just part of a friend group. There&#039;s nothing more obnoxious than an insular, codependent group of friends who only hang out with each other in large numbers and get drunk.

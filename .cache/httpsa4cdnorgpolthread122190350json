There are shit people of every race and there are good people in every race. <br><br>My issue is that a lot of black people are shit but try to mask it as being &quot;woke&quot; or whatever. <br><br>I am finding that it&#039;s kind of pointless to try and pin someone&#039;s behavior on their race entirely just due to the fact of outliers. For example, I would be considered a outlier for a black male my age(25). I graduated college. Went to grad school. Got a decent job and have had zero negative experiences with cops. <br><br>It&#039;s also funny to me when black peoples from the USA try to compare their plight with people from Africa. Even though I am black, I have nothing in common with blacks from Africa besides skin tone. I don&#039;t speak the language, don&#039;t have the same culture, don&#039;t have the same values or goals. I don&#039;t even call myself African American anymore because it seems weird to me. I wasn&#039;t born in Africa so Why would I say African American? <br><br>I have more in common with a white person living in the USA than a African. <br><br>Anyway, what does \/pol\/ think? Race just seems like a really strange thing to me. So strange that I rarely think about it. I understand that it is real though but from a interaction point, it doesn&#039;t seem too important. I do however understand that certain races might be susceptible or resistant to certain diseases and such. I don&#039;t believe in not seeing race. I just believe that when interacting with someone, their race probably won&#039;t mean much. <br><br>What is \/pol\/s take on it?","filename":"IMG_0193","ext":".jpg","w":3264,"h":2448,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1492811159399,"time":1492811159,"md5":"brMThilRf+DBJeG9uBcXzw==","fsize":1989455,"resto":0,"id":"cpr8n1Aj","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"not-really-caring-about-race","country_name":"United States","replies":9,"images":1,"unique_ips":7},{"no":122192112,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)17:59:53","name":"SomeTwat","com":"<a href=\"#p122190350\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122190350<\/a><br>Well it seems that you&#039;re american before your race then, good for you.<br><br>You seem like a fairly reasonable bloke so I&#039;ll ask you this one question on race;<br><br>While personality wise race doesn&#039;t particularly matter(as it&#039;s based on where and how you are raised) do you think all races should be maintained hence maintaining their identities anyway?<br>My main perspective on this is that, it wouldn&#039;t be the best if we were all to melt in the melting pot and that it would be a shame to lose actual diversity through merging everything biologically.<br><br>That being said socially I obviously have no issue with black people as long as they&#039;re decent people like you seem to be.<br>Then again this opinion of mine is likely R A R E as I&#039;m neither a &quot;I don&#039;t see race&quot; leftard or a &quot;Down with all races but mine.&quot; racist.","time":1492811993,"resto":122190350,"id":"xHSBtCMj","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122192336,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)18:01:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122190350\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122190350<\/a><br>if there is a collapse just make friends with a high iq group of americans who can aim well.<br><br>it is possible to group based on IQ over race.","filename":"racegoodfences","ext":".png","w":661,"h":746,"tn_w":110,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492812099603,"time":1492812099,"md5":"fLdxoHwLGsbE0dsV0QiBmA==","fsize":67342,"resto":122190350,"id":"EYjxTD4I","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122192743,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)18:05:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122190350\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122190350<\/a><br>Generally speaking, people of your race tend to be obnoxious, criminally inclined, welfare parasites so that tendency makes them all vote unilaterally democrat and fuck this country to shit.

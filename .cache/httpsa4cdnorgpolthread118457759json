Cutting NASA funding in strategic areas, appointing an education Secretary that wants to dumb down children and turn them into Christian warriors, appointing an energy Secretary that doesn&#039;t know what the hell the agency even does, and the cherry on the top is everyone&#039;s favorite corrupt flunkie Rex Tillerson who&#039;s already been bought and paid for by the a Russians.","time":1490583060,"resto":118457759,"id":"OeTul3+S","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118461318,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)22:54:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118460993\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118460993<\/a><br>People be like &quot;Trump is Putin&#039;s puppet&quot; to me.

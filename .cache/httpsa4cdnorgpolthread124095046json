Think about economics in terms of work: what are people actually doing with their time and efforts in order to make each others lives better? And the answer is that CEOs earning gazillions of dollars per minute does nothing to undermine the work that is performed by people, which is why living standards continue to go up once you account for all the free things that people now have access to (like the world&#039;s knowledge accessible at any time via the net).<br><br>Technology is deflationary so there is absolutely no need to think about CEOs and their pay or any of that shit. If people are doing meaningful work for each to create things for each other that are better quality than yesterday, or allow people to do less work for the same product that was created yesterday, then there has been economic progress. Capping CEO wages will do nothing to make their work better.","time":1493925304,"resto":124095046,"id":"xOsTKV2e","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":124096232,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)15:15:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124095228\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124095228<\/a>","filename":"1493575061477","ext":".jpg","w":780,"h":467,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":74,"tim":1493925310013,"time":1493925310,"md5":"dzgL27JX0puHFMgPxvL18w==","fsize":63627,"resto":124095046,"id":"KmQ39zpu","country":"RO","country_name":"Romania"},{"no":124096312,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)15:15:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Hey guys I just discovered this new principle that can be used to make life easier for everyone on the planet!<\/span><br>Said no one ever who didn&#039;t have funding from a rich patron.","time":1493925351,"resto":124095046,"id":"ilnAO0Ij","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":124096417,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)15:16:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"Why isn&#039;t there a maximum number of black people?","time":1493925404,"resto":124095046,"id":"VzbmgFlx","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124096556,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)15:17:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124096066\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124096066<\/a><br>You have no clue about economics.

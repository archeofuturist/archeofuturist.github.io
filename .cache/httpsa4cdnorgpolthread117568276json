Texas State trooper helping patrol the border. Everyone makes the border seem like the wild west full of gang shootings and drug cartels, but at least here where I am, that shit stays on the other side. Tranquil desert living next to the Rio Grande, all the Mexicans here own guns and work hard, amazing authentic Mexican food served in every restaurant and the women know their place and the men are men. Texas is like its own country, every region is different. I love my side","time":1490062525,"resto":117568276,"id":"mxuVTwgd","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

I look white, feel white, act white, and was born with blond hair and blue eyes, but am actually 1\/4 hispanic and 1\/4 native amierican. (inb4, 135 IQ + native blood mean YOU have to go back stormfags.)<br><br>It hit me like a ton of bricks. Fuck them and their race quota bullshit, I checked &quot;decline to answer&quot;. What if more people refused to play the race game? They can&#039;t do affirmative action and forced diversity if everyone refuses to state what race they are.<br><br>I just wish there was something more insulting than &quot;decline to answer&quot; like Zyphyrian, or Kekistani.

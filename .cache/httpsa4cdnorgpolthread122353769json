Example, birds who migrate thousands of miles, along the way and at their destination the insects that they feed on are being born either earlier or later which not only leaves them out of sync with the birds migratory patterns, but is also causing vast amounts of them to die due to shifts in the temperature leading to the birds starving to death as well. Various other niche creatures that are part of eco systems as well, examples being animals\/insects that live in certain temperature ranges and that historically lived closer to the base of mountains are now being forced higher and higher into shrinking territory if not losing all of it as the elevation is not enough. Biggest example of this are a few butterfly species in california that now only congregate on the few higher peaks left to them. Also just simple things like a corridor of cold essentially in canada keeping borer beetles from spreading is slowly vanishing which while not a nightmare scenario is definitely not a good thing.","filename":"1491557090532","ext":".jpg","w":485,"h":351,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":90,"tim":1492912440193,"time":1492912440,"md5":"KWP1Hii9TdaOCW68T1Jopg==","fsize":44227,"resto":122353769,"id":"qVnUzQs0","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122361728,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)21:54:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122361524\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122361524<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;yes, without it and other large particles<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;and other &quot;large&quot; particles<\/span>","time":1492912453,"resto":122353769,"id":"WbsKO4Zc","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122361790,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)21:54:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122361345\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122361345<\/a><br>I&#039;m using it as an example because I&#039;m talking to people who refuse to read scientific articles to try and understand the phenomenon, so I have to use things they know about and understand. same reason carl sagan used the two planets as an example, as he was largely talking to people who do not have an education.<br><br>if I start talking about energy retention and their relationship with atmospheric compounds(which I already have), you guys wouldn&#039;t comprehend any of it and respond with fallacy(like you already have), such as the concept that because venus is an extreme example means that large particles don&#039;t retain heat(even though they literally observably do).","time":1492912487,"resto":122353769,"id":"wsS1qun3","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122361796,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)21:54:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122355171\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122355171<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;people who can&#039;t accurately predict a hurricane&#039;s drift over 24 hours <\/span><br><br>done since the 1970s fool, local news weatherman != climatologists","time":1492912489,"resto":122353769,"id":"xGlaBwT3","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122361854,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)21:55:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122361021\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122361021<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;implying we should give a shit about the shitskins who die in 300 years because there is a global famine.<\/span><br><br>If there are white people, I expect them to figure it out.<br><br>If they aren&#039;t white people, I don&#039;t care that they cannot figure it out.","time":1492912521,"resto":122353769,"id":"nxJinZue","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122361969,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)21:56:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122361701\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122361701<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Quite literally<\/span><br><br>Muh birds and beetles and polar bears, dawg.

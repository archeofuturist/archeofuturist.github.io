Brits invaded, colonised, etc. We ousted them politically and violently from south. Multiple risings against Brits culminating in Easter rising and subsequent creation of Irish free state. Irish democratically voted to unify as Ireland and eject Brits. Brits artificially created &#039;Northern Ireland&#039; as an idea (never existed) as this is where the plantations were at their heaviest, resulting in a majority protestant, pro-Brit,<br>Pro-unionist (mainly Scots, which incidentally are made up of an Irish tribe that had invaded and mixed with other Celtic tribe) population. As of this year, unionists are a minority in the six occupied counties, and I guarantee you that Ireland will be reunified within 25 years. Also, we had the Ra who were freedom fighters called terrorists by the Brits, obviously. Undefeated and tormented the Brits. Killed Lord Mountbatten for the lulz. Eventually genuinely became terrorists with the inexcusable Omagh bombings. Anyway, they have tons more people than us and still, inevitably, lost, after an 800+ year history. Also, we have an older, richer culture than they do. One of the main reasons for invasion was that Ireland was pagan. Pope actually gave Henry permission to invade. Christian royals legitimacy was founded on divine right to rule. They couldn&#039;t tolerate Irish kings who came from royal lines predating British royalty by a thousand years.

The call of duty playing millennial generation American soldiers, who had grown up in an age of low intensity conflicts and precision munitions, are in for a rude awakening when they are mercilessly crushed by the Korean People&#039;s Army.<br><br>The Korean People&#039;s Army is a mechanized juggernaut possessing thousands of artillery, tanks, and is made up of millions of men and women who are determined to carry out the orders of the supreme commander at any cost. Although Socialist Korea&#039;s air force is not the most up to date, but it, along with her artillery and strategic rocket forces, are more than capable of wiping out American and SK airpower on the ground in a first strike scenario. After that it&#039;s game over for the Americans and South Koreans as the KPAF operates with total aerial supremacy while the KPA ground forces mops up any remaining resistance. The Korean People&#039;s Army is capable of conducting a shock and awe campaign that will make the invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan look like children&#039;s games.<br><br>Socialist Korea has not only the military might, but more importantly the political will to wage total war against all imperialist forces and South Korean traitors until the final victory.","filename":"1452723515322","ext":".jpg","w":1000,"h":1000,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493008721177,"time":1493008721,"md5":"PfGad0Eb5gWCoZREbMUQzw==","fsize":175161,"resto":122540767,"id":"xdl653fW","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122543383,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)00:38:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122543200\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122543200<\/a><br><a href=\"#p122543200\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122543200<\/a><br>I just don&#039;t really see a huge push into SK.

They can threaten SK&#039;s cities and defensive positions, as well as serve combat roles and anti-air. The problem is that the more they use their arty, the more it is exposed and becomes vulnerable to enemy fire. Furthermore, NK does not have the industrial capacity to replace materiel losses especially in a protracted conflict.<br><br>This means that NK doctrine would stick to one of two paths: Either they go all out in a shock-and-awe barrage against SK and attempt to take Seoul quickly so they can hold it hostage in exchange for some kind of bargain, or achieve an advantageous position early on so they can drag out the war and influence US public opinion to end their participation. Or, they take a more conservative approach and act defensively, saving their key artillery for operations against invading US\/SK forces, again to draw out the war and make it end inconclusively as US public opinion forces them to pull out.<br><br>However it doesn&#039;t really matter which doctrine they choose to follow. If there is no Chinese intervention then NK has already lost, they simply can&#039;t fight a prolonged conflict against the US. Unless the Chinese lend them support and it becomes a second Vietnam, then NK is just stalling for time against a foe that is superior on every front and can outlast and outgun them at every opportunity. According to your scenario China is actually threatening NK so they would likely be complicit with the US operation and so NK would be screwed. They likely wouldn&#039;t hold out for long and if Kim refused to surrender, a coup would likely end his life, and the war, before the US has to go in and search every underground bunker.","time":1493009389,"resto":122540767,"id":"LkzEG1hk","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122544533,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)00:50:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122544334\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122544334<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;let&#039;s allow a completely unstable country to start making nukes<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;not to mention how illegal it is to make nukes now<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;untraceable nukes by a country who doesn&#039;t follow nuke protocol<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;nukes that can go anywhere... because they are not marked and accounted for<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;like how they are with every nuke capable country<\/span><br><br>But who cares... right?","time":1493009405,"resto":122540767,"id":"07kDkMTq","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122544558,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)00:50:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122544243\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122544243<\/a><br>Don&#039;t mind me.

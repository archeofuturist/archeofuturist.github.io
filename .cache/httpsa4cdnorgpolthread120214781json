They basically hated each other for 20 years until 06. Then baghdad was bombed in 09, and a tape was released implicating two Syrians. The Syrian gov denied anything to do with it.

They voted not expel Syria from the league of arab states, kept their embassy in Syria while others closed, and some local Iraqi lawmaker in the far north of Iraq opened a refugee camp in 2012.

Absolutely no support for the Assad regime from Iraq. However, Kurdish Iraqis are fighting against the al-Nusra front on the border. Rebel forces have also seized territory near the border.

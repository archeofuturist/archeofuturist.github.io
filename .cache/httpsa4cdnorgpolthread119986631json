Everyday I hear about my country importing more and more military vehicles, tanks, long range missiles, self propelled artillery with up to 40 km range, drones, no weapons because we have developed private arms industry, support equipment. We have propaganda posters about joining the army and air force everywhere, almost in every fucking tram. We are getting an obligatory military service.<br>We are buying military equipment from EU countries (mostly Germany) at a relativly low price and getting a lot of free weapons, vehicles, drones etc of the newest tech from USA.<br>So my question is, does any one of you EU nations notice the same thing? Mostly asking the bordering ones, Hungary, Poland,..<br>My country is not doing economicaly good at all and we are in debt but our investments in the military are huge. <br>Forgot to mention our president is NATO whore.<br>What is NATO arming us against? We are just a random low developed country why are they investing in our military so much?","filename":"tank","ext":".jpg","w":768,"h":512,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1491586026810,"time":1491586026,"md5":"5KTelvP4IWjnRQxb1lPIWg==","fsize":89239,"resto":0,"id":"TzQojxlg","country":"HR","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"hello-random-croatian-here-with-several-military","country_name":"Croatia","replies":30,"images":5,"unique_ips":21},{"no":119988340,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)13:36:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119986631\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119986631<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What is NATO arming us against?<\/span><br>Does your country spend 2%, if not fuck off...","time":1491586570,"resto":119986631,"id":"1CWB+z\/p","country":"LT","country_name":"Lithuania"},{"no":119989266,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)13:41:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119986631\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119986631<\/a><br>Same thing here.","time":1491586907,"resto":119986631,"id":"jW729nL5","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":119989526,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)13:43:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119986631\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119986631<\/a><br>Death to facist croats, praise president Slobodan","time":1491586992,"resto":119986631,"id":"UoKlcTyK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119989729,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)13:44:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119986631\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119986631<\/a><br>Your nation died when it joined the EU","time":1491587063,"resto":119986631,"id":"monN7t3f","country":"SG","country_name":"Singapore"},{"no":119989895,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)13:45:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"Da, gife me your troop numbers please.

I&#039;m clearly talking about his continuation of the war in Yemen (no ISIS there!), as well as bombing Assad because Mattis needed to get rid of a few bombs.<br><br>In addition, he&#039;s basically not doing anything that he promised. The travel ban got shut down, and he for some reason isn&#039;t taking it to the Supreme Court. The wall has become a fence. He&#039;s going to &quot;work something out&quot; with the DREAMers. He&#039;s not going to be able to repeal birthright citizenship. He promised to restore immigration to historic levels, but then he briefly mentions a merit-based system, which he hasn&#039;t spoken about since.<br><br>He&#039;s also crying about muh beautiful syrian babies let&#039;s go carve up the middle east for those poor beautiful babies oh Ivanka don&#039;t look!<br><br>Finally, he kicked out Flynn, he&#039;s in the process of kicking out Bannon, and he&#039;s currently cozying up to the keepers of the swamp like McMaster. <br><br>If he ends up fulfilling all his promises, i.e.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;wall<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;end birthright citizenship<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;restore immigration to historic levels<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;term limits on congress<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;cripple lobbyists<\/span><br><br>then I&#039;ll admit I was wrong. It just seems like, at this point, that&#039;s not going to happen. And that&#039;s only a first step on the path to making America great again. There&#039;s so much that needs to be done, yet he spends all day golfing.<br><br>I&#039;m not even a shill, I&#039;m just really cynical, and it&#039;s honestly starting to look like I got played. Please prove me wrong.","filename":"12308018401","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":720,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1492439238270,"time":1492439238,"md5":"bxOB5kHf1OKbGmMenUG4jg==","fsize":26101,"resto":121528869,"id":"ozmegqx1","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":121531318,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)10:27:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121528869\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121528869<\/a><br><a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/121530796#p121530796\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121530796<\/a>","time":1492439239,"resto":121528869,"id":"wSACEGUp","country":"LV","country_name":"Latvia"},{"no":121531366,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)10:27:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121531254\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121531254<\/a><br>fuck off white nigger<br><br>if you think this is shilling welcome to your first time here","time":1492439265,"resto":121528869,"id":"EJ0tHhKd","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121531369,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)10:27:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"this singer","filename":"I.C.E ","ext":".png","w":900,"h":900,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492439269464,"time":1492439269,"md5":"FyH9sa6nvSayUfjbrJ7z8A==","fsize":343912,"resto":121528869,"id":"9QuQf+5a","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121531392,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)10:28:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121530762\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121530762<\/a><br>How many times does it have to be explained to you that communists aren&#039;t people?","filename":"antifa","ext":".gif","w":480,"h":270,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1492439285473,"time":1492439285,"md5":"psdRqeO5lG6PUapItN2+5g==","fsize":3049073,"resto":121528869,"id":"IW4bwtBf","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121531412,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)10:28:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121531181\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121531181<\/a><br>nice observation, but still, the polls go savage on their assholes","filename":"C9JqHzTXgAIyxP5.jpg large","ext":".jpg","w":480,"h":775,"tn_w":77,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492439297889,"time":1492439297,"md5":"+RZnRsS0F995FPJhwCv6Cg==","fsize":47878,"resto":121528869,"id":"iK\/NkZkj","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":121531417,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)10:28:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121531295\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121531295<\/a><br>get a good nap?","time":1492439300,"resto":121528869,"id":"h89fOrj6","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121531420,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)10:28:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"when will Donald read to us.","filename":"tumblr_o0lk8yaTaE1v0pigno1_500","ext":".jpg","w":499,"h":499,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":124,"tim":1492439302525,"time":1492439302,"md5":"i3waisMKJ6I3X4FLNGXu\/g==","fsize":42100,"resto":121528869,"id":"0RPjWf3a","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121531433,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)10:28:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"Trump speaking live now at the WH","time":1492439308,"resto":121528869,"id":"s0OSDduw","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121531437,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)10:28:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"Holy shit, Richard Spencer is singing at the White House!!","time":1492439311,"resto":121528869,"id":"6UePeGAc","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121531440,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)10:28:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121528960\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121528960<\/a>","filename":"1491500523643","ext":".gif","w":480,"h":425,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":110,"tim":1492439312836,"time":1492439312,"md5":"yYss0N\/D\/3UfrENMsf9RGw==","fsize":2288698,"resto":121528869,"id":"DqF3mrzW","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121531445,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)10:28:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"what the hell is Trump feeding barron???

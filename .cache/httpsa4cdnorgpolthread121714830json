Is that to be the future of Europe? And is this competition to be organised within our European brotherhood? Bringing in these sweat-fields in Africa into our Europe civilisation, so that the financial power in one European country can use it against the financial power in another? Or the great financial central power of the world, now shifted from the City of London to Wall Street, New York? Shall be able on the mass of money, of wealth and of power which it brings to it? Again and again to exert it&#039;s influence in politics? Until that you see the day, it is childish nonsense to say that a British government rules Britain! Its nothing to do with British government or the British people! <br><br>The government of the world is the financial government! The power of money, and of money alone! &quot;","filename":"swald-mosley-attendsafiery-blackshirt-rally-in-manchester-circa-1938-14297071","ext":".png","w":500,"h":476,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":238,"tim":1492538240712,"time":1492538240,"md5":"V8gOujG9vYv08sXZhoFcuQ==","fsize":126941,"resto":0,"id":"Y3biVY5K","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"like-the-other-poor-devils-in-china-india-and","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":121715593,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)14:03:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121714830\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121714830<\/a><br>It&#039;s safe to say Mosley was the most red pilled Englishman of 20th century","time":1492538613,"resto":121714830,"id":"aDYbU1yQ","country":"ME","country_name":"Montenegro"}]}

There is something about the numinous that evokes a &quot;spiritual&quot;or religious feeling. Doesnt mean that you should believe in jesus because his mom never fucked anyone. Or muhammad or vishnu etc for that matter.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;If religion only serves as a function of hope for the living, why do you seek to destroy it?<\/span><br>Not all the things people believe are meek and mild.

I had written an essay about things that weren&#039;t even really that partisan. That poor nations are poor because of bad trade deals like the TPP, the Restrictions on their own industries, red tape procedures, and local economies being based off of foreign goods. He wrote me off as a racist, I am a classical liberal\/libertarian. But believe me, I speak for more than just myself when I say this<br><br><br>-If they keep up this strangling of ideologies, where everything that is not liberal\/marxist is wrong, I will be forced to take more red pills. I used to be a liberal cuck in high school, but ive been drifting right. The professor said I was racist because I said &quot;for the sake of discussion, we will not discuss historical factors like colonization, but rather modern things affecting poorer nations.&quot; Is that racist? If thinking that countries are being held back because of inept bureaucrats and backwards ideologies is racist, am I racist \/pol\/? Why is it the Chinese professor, and the Austrian professor I have in pol\/sci and econ loved my paper, but the african hated it?? can someone help me?","filename":"1489742631313","ext":".png","w":1302,"h":722,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":138,"tim":1491237293252,"time":1491237293,"md5":"VojIpiW9X5KsD+GdGrM\/jw==","fsize":184452,"resto":0,"id":"WdPCWxOM","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"problems-in-us-colleges","country_name":"United States","replies":11,"images":0,"unique_ips":10},{"no":119347222,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)12:37:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119346983\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119346983<\/a><br>It doesn&#039;t matter if you are racist or not.

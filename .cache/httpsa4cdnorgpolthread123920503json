The email reportedly provided assurances that Attorney General Lynch would protect Secretary Clinton by making sure the FBI investigation quote unquote &#039;didn&#039;t go too far&#039;. How and when did you first learn of this document? Also who sent it, and who received it?<br><br>Hon. James B. Comey, JR (FBI): That is not a question I can answer is this forum Mr. Chairman because it would call for a classified response. I have briefed leaders of the intelligence committees on that particular issue but I can&#039;t talk about it here.<br><br>Mr. Grassley (Chairman): Uh.. you can expect me to follow up with you on that point.<br><br>Hon. James B. Comey, JR (FBI): Sure.<br><br>Mr. Grassley (Chairman): What steps did the FBI take to determine whether attorney general Lynch had actually given assurances that the political fix was in no matter what? Did the FBI interview the person who wrote the email? If not \u2013 why not?<br><br>Hon. James B. Comey, JR (FBI): I have to give you the same answer. I can\u2019t talk about that in an unclassified setting.<br><br>Mr. Grassley (Chairman): Okay. Then you can expect me to follow up on that. I asked the FBI to provide this email to the committee before today\u2019s hearing. What haven\u2019t you done so, and will you provide it by the end of this week?<br><br>Hon. James B. Comey, JR (FBI): Again. To\u2026 to react to that I have to give a classified answer and I can\u2019t give it sitting here.<br><br>Mr. Grassley (Chairman): So that means you can\u2019t give me the email?<br><br>Hon. James B. Comey, JR (FBI): I\u2019m not confirming there was an email, sir. I can\u2019t. The subject is classified, and in an appropriate forum, I would be happy to brief you on it. But I can\u2019t do it in an open hearing.<br><br>Mr. Grassley (Chairman): Uh.

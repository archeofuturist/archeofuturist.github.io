Fascism right? In fact it&#039;s textbook fascism. Perpetuating the &quot;heroic&quot; historical narrative, that was hardly his attempt at a dialectic. Rather Evola strikes me as someone you could epistemologically contrast to Hegel from the point of view of his Absolute individual (like the teutonic knights for instance) as a repudiation of Hegel&#039;s absolute idealism, where the subjects relationship to the object was entirely different. But this is hardly an attempt at a dialectic. Here is seems to be more obvious that he borrows from Spengler more than anybody else. The concept of civilizational cycles bares such a stark resemblance to those of Spengler&#039;s apart from his own enunciated &quot;final stage&quot; which he called the Kali Yuga that reading him through the prism of Spengler himself becomes impossible, especially as Spengler presents his perspective on this historicity in a more accessible and coherent way. This degenerative stage known as Hali Uga borrows itself (or rather appropriates) heavily from hindu doctrine. This only shows you that Evola had an enormously creative mind. He wanted to be unique, knowing full well that people would see too much of Nietzsche and Spengler in his writing otherwise. His arguments do ultimately pertain to an anti-materialistic societal order based on a &quot;hierarchy of the mind&quot;, now this too does remind us all to much of Nietzsche; tasking the philosopher to transcend and create his own &quot;hierarchy of values&quot;, such as those Plato&#039;s philosopher king would do as a ruler.","time":1490319254,"resto":118013114,"id":"nEpriHch","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":118020749,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)21:41:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118018556\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118018556<\/a><br><br>Nietzche?

I believe you can have both but it really depends on who administrates the power. I merely think it&#039;s more of an acceptance that the majority of people are too dumb to follow rationalism and too emotionally involved in themselves to reach for stoic virtue. In the idea of the spiritual, I believe there is an acceptance of the human to have an urge to look for meaning in emotions and tales to create a simulation which nulls the vacum of nihilism. In that way I think neglicence towards dialetics are justified, that and also primemarely because it should be the job of the individual to sort his emotions from his reasons.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Here is seems to be more obvious that he borrows from Spengler more than anybody else.<\/span><br>Defenatly, I was under the impression of this as well.<br><br>The rest you&#039;re saying is aimed towards the book and it sounds interesting.

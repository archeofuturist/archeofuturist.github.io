Fascism right? In fact it&#039;s textbook fascism. Perpetuating the &quot;heroic&quot; historical narrative, that was hardly his attempt at a dialectic. Rather Evola strikes me as someone you could epistemologically contrast to Hegel from the point of view of his Absolute individual (like the teutonic knights for instance) as a repudiation of Hegel&#039;s absolute idealism, where the subjects relationship to the object was entirely different. But this is hardly an attempt at a dialectic. Here is seems to be more obvious that he borrows from Spengler more than anybody else. The concept of civilizational cycles bares such a stark resemblance to those of Spengler&#039;s apart from his own enunciated &quot;final stage&quot; which he called the Kali Yuga that reading him through the prism of Spengler himself becomes impossible, especially as Spengler presents his perspective on this historicity in a more accessible and coherent way. This degenerative stage known as Hali Uga borrows itself (or rather appropriates) heavily from hindu doctrine. This only shows you that Evola had an enormously creative mind. He wanted to be unique, knowing full well that people would see too much of Nietzsche and Spengler in his writing otherwise. His arguments do ultimately pertain to an anti-materialistic societal order based on a &quot;hierarchy of the mind&quot;, now this too does remind us all to much of Nietzsche; tasking the philosopher to transcend and create his own &quot;hierarchy of values&quot;, such as those Plato&#039;s philosopher king would do as a ruler.","time":1490319254,"resto":118013114,"id":"nEpriHch","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":118020749,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)21:41:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118018556\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118018556<\/a><br><br>Nietzche?

I believe you can have both but it really depends on who administrates the power. I merely think it&#039;s more of an acceptance that the majority of people are too dumb to follow rationalism and too emotionally involved in themselves to reach for stoic virtue. In the idea of the spiritual, I believe there is an acceptance of the human to have an urge to look for meaning in emotions and tales to create a simulation which nulls the vacum of nihilism. In that way I think neglicence towards dialetics are justified, that and also primemarely because it should be the job of the individual to sort his emotions from his reasons.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Here is seems to be more obvious that he borrows from Spengler more than anybody else.<\/span><br>Defenatly, I was under the impression of this as well.<br><br>The rest you&#039;re saying is aimed towards the book and it sounds interesting.

My writing at this late hour is a semi-structured stream of consciousness at best. I wasn&#039;t making a pedagogical argument for or against Evola as such, I only wished to point out that he has inexorably become linked as an early contemporary to fascism, just like Spengler was to National-socialism. Ironically they both fell out with these regimes towards the end. <br><br>My key points of contention:<br><br>* Evola saw the world in a process of devolution (Being in the times of the Kali Yuga), as opposed to the rationalistic model of progress and evolution. <br><br>* The role of aristocracy, the caste system and Heroic virtues are all articulated in &quot;Revolt against the modern world&quot;. By reading this it becomes clear that Evola favoured a stratification between the aristocracy and the masses, which he argued, like a typical conservative, was an organic societal structure. More than anything he despised the plebeian rule which was the main trait in both democracies and communist societies (both considered as consumerist rather than spiritual in nature as they were both grounded in a materialistic worldview). <br><br>* Evola&#039;s traditional society, i.e. that which he defines as a &quot;golden age&quot; is a society where men are free from the spiritual and psychological pollutions and ills of the modern world. The further we move away from that, the more degenerate we are. <br><br>Rule by divine kings -&gt; rule by a warrior aristocracy -&gt; rule by merchants and finally rule by plebeians i.e democracy (Kali Yuga). modernity had separated man, and - by extension - civilization from the metaphysical, the divine. Both capitalism and communism lead to a materialism which inevitably destroys traditional culture and atomistics civilization, where people are separated from their communities, their neighbors, their race (mystical race and not biological race mind you) and their class.<br><br>Fascism was an anti-materialistic movement, which is why he initially supported it.","time":1490322153,"resto":118013114,"id":"nEpriHch","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":118025807,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)22:23:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118025552\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118025552<\/a><br>What is it with \/pol\/ and Sicily?

When production is low, a caste system works, when it increases it becomes hollowed out of meaning and impossible to preserve beyond shallow symbolic meaning. Look at India for instance.

I never get to talk about Evola irl with anybody so I might as well get it out of the system. It&#039;s not that common to hear somebody say that they have read his works. <br><br>Once again, if your interested in his critique of fascism i would recommend &quot;Fascism Viewed from the Right&quot;. It&#039;s pretty good. The main point being something like: &quot;Well Mr Mussolini if all is within the state, nothing outside the state, nothing against the state then why hasn&#039;t the fascist party abolished itself already?&quot;<br><br><a href=\"#p118027263\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118027263<\/a><br><br>I see. You know what would be really cool though? A proper attempt at synthesizing his theories with a functioning economic model as it couldn&#039;t be either a socialist or capitalist one, nor a technocratic or autocratic rule as such. <br><br>Anyway good luck to you on your project. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;<\/span><br>I&#039;m actually currently working on an theory on the idea of salvaging a nation.

That&#039;s all that I will say. I think you can find some good inspiration from him. It&#039;s closer to home and he was technically the first predecessor to all of them. He is the father of geopolitics. I can really recommend reading &quot;Stormakterna och v\u00e4rldskrisen&quot;, &quot;Staten som livsform&quot; etc. <br><br>I bid thee a good night!","time":1490323672,"resto":118013114,"id":"nEpriHch","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":118029374,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)22:53:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118028701\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118028701<\/a><br>Thanks I&#039;ll defenatly look into Rudolf Kj\u00e9llen.<br>I would hope to come across you on \/pol\/ again one day.<br><br>Good night my friend.","time":1490324017,"resto":118013114,"id":"2z+uwKVb","country":"DK","country_name":"Denmark"},{"no":118031584,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)23:11:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118013114\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118013114<\/a><br><br>I&#039;m reading Ride The Tiger and it&#039;s good so far.

I found his prose to be enticing and accomplished, his ideas however, are not that coherent and well argued. Believing that all of modernity was one giant mistake and then to go on advocating a return to a &quot;spiritual&quot; (whatever that means) caste system reminiscent of the feudal era in Europe only shows you that someone who was born into a aristocratic lineage can be unashamed in arguing for the serfdom of others. Bolstering prose might make it more romanticized, but to literally believe in such a system goes against the fundamentals of economic progress itself, which would sacrifice the future development of the Nation he purportedly holds so dear.","filename":"1490277923635","ext":".png","w":1280,"h":632,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":61,"tim":1490317214733,"time":1490317214,"md5":"cXLqPzSnUqDzqqs9vx8YXw==","fsize":963931,"resto":118013114,"id":"nEpriHch","country":"SE","m_img":1,"country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":118015531,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)21:01:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118014794\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118014794<\/a><br>Please stop this excessive larping.","time":1490317266,"resto":118013114,"id":"2z+uwKVb","country":"DK","country_name":"Denmark"},{"no":118015943,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)21:04:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"From a philosophical standpoint:<br>Garbage.","time":1490317460,"resto":118013114,"id":"gpM\/eOdG","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":118016160,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)21:06:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118015412\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118015412<\/a><br>&quot;spiritual&quot; is refering to Volkgeist I supposed.

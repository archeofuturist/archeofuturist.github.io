Im mad that right before the election there was infiltration of the MODS that severely effected the board. And the amount of research that was being done, and it was based against republicans. That is a fact. Im also mad that the rules are enforced on what is said to be discretion but when I search \/bans I see warning for lefty&#039;s and bans for repubs. Also, the you mad whyte bois shit that is STILL allowed even after mass reports. Like the last thread said....they are allowed to goto +300 comments before deleting the evidence so it doesn&#039;t get archived. (Unfortunately for them, I know how to use my own archives....and stored +3 months of what was going on.....labled) Im also mad about the dick shopping shit...my shit is ment as an insult and nothing less, and i&#039;ve been doing it longer than the MODS haven&#039;t been virgins. Im also mad about the no raid bullshit clause and let me heavily elaborate on that bullshit. EVERY platform raids! Facebook is the master of raids! Twitter! VOAT! Reddit (Heavily and proven)! Of all the cucks that are allowed raids....Reddit is. You make us weak when you take our power away from us. An everlasting target that is open for attack and can&#039;t defend itself. It is a very sad day on the internet when....Godlike Productions and Reddit are less cucked than the great all mighty 4chan. You guys really need to get the fuck over that pussy ass panzy shit. We are held to standards that even old people websites....and Reddit aren&#039;t","time":1492690846,"resto":121988353,"id":"0GTKEbY0","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121989923,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)08:29:36","name":"Hitler Himself","com":"Raids and \/i\/ will ALWAYS be in our blood. But it&#039;s not just focused at 4chan, You know that. It&#039;s done on every single platform.....but 4chan. And that&#039;s pretty pathetic. I see such great potential, if you just let us go.....or banner up and let us know your there and watching. We&#039;d respect you more. Especially if you came and openly played and researched with us. That would be a YUGE moral booster. A sanctioned \/i\/......I would pay for, there are soo many great minds here it&#039;s not funny. Alot can be fixed or accomplished.....if you just let us go. HWNDU flag was an inspiration, the antifa bike lock bandit being discovered and finished in less than 12 hours....is testament to legitimacy. Tracking ISIS was an inspiration....these things also set people on would could become a very positive path in life, because they found out they were good at something that they previously didn&#039;t know they were. Maybe inspire a college kid to become a cop or FBI agent for the right reasons.","time":1492691376,"resto":121988353,"id":"0GTKEbY0","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121990072,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)08:31:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"I agree","filename":"1492283941829","ext":".gif","w":410,"h":258,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":78,"tim":1492691505827,"time":1492691505,"md5":"fSjL2IuYprnT7e8twSUgGA==","fsize":1021965,"resto":121988353,"id":"kINBbMQM","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121990215,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)08:33:43","name":"Hitler Himself","com":"<a href=\"#p121990072\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121990072<\/a><br>So what are we going to do about it?

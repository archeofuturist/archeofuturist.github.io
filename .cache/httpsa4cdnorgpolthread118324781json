It&#039;s horrible. I haven&#039;t even made it through the tutorial mission. It wouldn&#039;t allow me to manually save as it restricts saving in a &quot;priority mission&quot;, so I just turned it off. Horrible layout (it&#039;s like they purposefully mapped buttons to the worst possible selections), the UI is a mess, the controls are fucked, the running is bad, the jumping is bad, the scanning system is annoying, the dialogue is embarrassing. I found it weird that the opening of the game, there were almost zero white people. I could even deal with 50\/50. Maybe 70\/30 (considering how white people will be a minority in the future in the States, and I guess whites are a minority worldwide already, right? And this game is supposed to be about humanity trekking across the galaxy.). But when nearly EVERY character is non-white, it just screams SJW. It&#039;s disconcerting. They&#039;re trying way too hard.<br><br>And as you all know: the crazed, bugged out eyes, twitchy facial expressions, desynced lips (think of Kung fu movies), ugh.<br><br>The other thing that really jumped out at me was when you walk up to NPCs. Example: A medical examiner is assessing someone who was just pulled out of cryostasis. So they animated the examiner kneeling over the person typing onto his wrist hologram PC thing while supposedly examining the physical condition of the person. BUT...as soon as you even get near the characters, the examiner and the patient crane their heads immediately in your direction and follow your movements like a dog. The medical examiner continues furiously typing away at his wrist computer while staring at you. There&#039;s no way that is muscle memory. How is he typing on this computer one-handed, examining the patient, talking to him, while staring at you? It&#039;s really weird. And all of the NPC characters do it, no matter what action they&#039;re performing. This game has ZERO immersion. This game is trash.","filename":"IMG_4998","ext":".jpg","w":657,"h":527,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":100,"tim":1490509617727,"time":1490509617,"md5":"TZHXSm9rGTvZuO5nlkUaFQ==","fsize":46709,"resto":118324781,"id":"nG95F4xR","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118329681,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)02:27:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118325722\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118325722<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;game series is ruined by diversity hires<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;it&#039;s only a problem because you&#039;re RAYCISS<\/span><br>this is your brain on tumblr","filename":"04658974851695","ext":".jpg","w":510,"h":525,"tn_w":121,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490509621943,"time":1490509621,"md5":"WHgxnrRYA45zUJhO9c4tQw==","fsize":41332,"resto":118324781,"id":"WYHwtZm3","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118329698,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)02:27:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118329616\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118329616<\/a><br>Why the fuck do people even listen to them.","time":1490509633,"resto":118324781,"id":"27\/ugwjc","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":118329892,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)02:29:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118329384\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118329384<\/a><br>biggest prob with gwent is going to get people who spent 100s of dollars on hearthstone to switch. god hearthstone sucks","time":1490509770,"resto":118324781,"id":"IopnCADw","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118329959,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)02:30:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118329650\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118329650<\/a><br>It came out only a few days ago.

Each share has one vote, and the shareholders elect a board, which hires and fires managers. This business\u2019s customers are its residents. A profitably-managed state will, like any business, serve its customers efficiently and effectively. Misgovernment equals mismanagement. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;There will be no direct profit from having a share because this incentivizes taxation to the MPoK&#039;s own citizens. Instead of that, we are creating a land-linked resource, this is to jumpstart a cryptocurrency which will be backed with one square meter of land in the MPoK per coin. Shares to vote will be given to those who exchange currency for land.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;So this way, the profit comes not from the robbery of the effort of the residents but from the increase on the value of land, which drives an increase on the value of our cryptocurrency. Even more important, there are no foreign shareholders with a right to vote and with the intent to take over the system, but there are foreign coinholders who profit from our success, so they are willing to trade with us. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Now the interests of the shareholders are identical. They all want one thing: for MPoK to be as profitable as possible.

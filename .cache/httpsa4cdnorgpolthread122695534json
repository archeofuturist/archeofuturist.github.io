Neither of them require more or less evidence to be valid.<br><br>In terms of explaining the existence of our universe one must deal with the teleological question, namely why should the universe be as it is rather than some other form. A simple argument would be to claim that the Earth or Man must require a designer; but a far more fundamental and difficult paradox arises from the basic laws of physics. Simply put all the fundamental forces of physics (gravity, electromagnetism, strong and weak nuclear force) have set values as do cosmological constants like the speed of light which when put together form our universe. However there is no logical reason for any of these values to be as they are rather than any other value and a slight alteration to any of them would drastically change the universe for example a slight increase or decrease in the power of gravity could preclude the formation of stars and planets and leave the universe a giant cloud of plasma.<br><br>So to answer the teleological question one is left with two possible answers.<br><br>1: The universe was designed by someone or something.<br><br>2; The universe was not designed but is one of an infinite number of universes and we just happen to be in a good one.<br><br>Both assertions can be deemed necessary to explain existence and both can be criticized for a lack of evidence. In the one case proof for the existence of a creator is lacking, in the other case proof for the existence of infinite universes is lacking. Having studied the question, I would say neither theory is significantly more or less defensible than the other and agnosticism is ultimately the logical stance to adopt.","filename":"God - Of course its a good idea","ext":".png","w":500,"h":376,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":94,"tim":1493098665143,"time":1493098665,"md5":"RsDAdcK4WvVEHjYpUDm9xg==","fsize":391973,"resto":122695534,"id":"Jgw1keyw","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122698802,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)01:38:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122695534\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122695534<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;le American protestants jerk themselves off over a pile of strawmen and adapt a chain email into a full length movie meme<\/span><br><br>Agnosticism is the true metaphysical path.

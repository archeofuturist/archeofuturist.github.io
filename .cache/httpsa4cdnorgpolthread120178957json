He sent something like sixty missiles to AN EMPTY SYRIAN AIRBASE. And the whole &quot;hardy har he spent muh ninety gorillion dollahs on it&quot; meme is false. Do you really think the government is shitty enough to spend that much money on an airstrike meant only to intimidate? Not only that, but these missiles have shelf lives, they&#039;ll decrease in price. It&#039;s also been PROVED WITH ACTUAL FUCKING EVIDENCE that gas tanks were destroyed at the bombing. I don&#039;t at all see Assad as a bad person, he&#039;s the good guy of this whole situation. Trump destroyed gas tanks found there\u2014as they were presumably used by ISIS rebels\u2014dispelled the notion of a Russo-American electoral collusion\u2014Putin has a hard-on for Bashar the Basher\u2014and developed an imposing air against ISIS. He also did this while he was meeting with the President of China, which was a profoundly ballsy move on his part. All three sides in this gestalt are winners. The whole Ivanka fiasco is also a lie, I do believe Ivanka wet herself trying to get Trump to assblast Assad the un-Assblastable, but this gave Trump an idea: a saber-rattle, and a big one, at that. This way, after committing what seems like a massive terrorist attack, he could pin the idea of the airstrike on his kikedaughter, giving her a bad image instead of him.","filename":"Screenshot (18)","ext":".png","w":700,"h":768,"tn_w":113,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491686199923,"time":1491686199,"md5":"q255aZn9RJmEtJ2l+Qj7DA==","fsize":501588,"resto":120178957,"id":"OwMdk4LD","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120184076,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)17:17:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120183418\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120183418<\/a><br>Nice thread, too bad i missed it.","time":1491686239,"resto":120178957,"id":"CMvbXbjt","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":120184424,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)17:20:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120179736\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120179736<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;t.

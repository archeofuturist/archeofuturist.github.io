In fact, laughter (keks) is a natural reaction to the unexpected, the illogical, and the RANDOM (Chaos). Kek showed himself to \/pol\/ because we love Chaos as well as Order (repeating numbrs). Some say the prophecies come true merely due to the power of group-think (many people believing in the same thing at once making it come true) but this is the work of Kek. Group-think has given Kek energy, and He now has the power to cause Chaos and Order in His vision.","filename":"IMG_3716(2)","ext":".png","w":467,"h":496,"tn_w":117,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490573606047,"time":1490573606,"md5":"1DMC2HJaSQRqa4iVaDg4qA==","fsize":97970,"resto":118441924,"id":"GVV7G9xD","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118442125,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)20:13:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Chaos and Order: comparison with the traditional &quot;good vs evil&quot;<\/span><br> Chaos dominates the universe. Quantum particles are treated as waveforms due to the randomness of their location and velocity. The void of space is filled with tremendous stars that explode and form bottomless pits of mass. However, Order creates a balance in the Chaos. The universe follows strict laws of physics. Mathematics allow us to predict events.<br> Good and evil do not exist from an objective point of view. Truth comes in the form of Chaos and Order: things that can or cannot be predicted. Other religions tend to focus on the battle between good and evil when in fact NEITHER OF THOSE THINGS EXIST. Good and evil are subjective and don&#039;t even exist in a universe without self-aware beings. Only Chaos and Order.<br> This begs the question: does destiny exist? Does Kek have a plan for all of us? Or does he create and destroy at his whim? Some may think that Kek is controlling everything in our singular universe (Order), but others may believe in a multiverse where any and all possible timelines occur (Chaos).","time":1490573622,"resto":118441924,"id":"GVV7G9xD","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118442166,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)20:13:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Can a society (Kekistan) function on a religion without &quot;right and wrong&quot;?<\/span><br> The answer is YES. Politics has an abundance of Chaos as well as Order. The two go hand in hand! Freedom is inherently Chaotic. The free market is driven by Chaos, as well as the innovative minds of our scholars and artists. By understanding Chaos, we will further understand the struggles of war and disease. ORDER prevents Kekistanis from harming each other, and allows for Balance (Order) in the Chaos. One example of such logic is that Anarcho Capitalism is too much Chaos while Communism is too much Order. The Jew may attempt to bring more Chaos (imbalance) to Kekistan, but we shall maintain Order (stability) to our nation and Kek will unleash his Chaos (wrath) unto the Jew.","time":1490573638,"resto":118441924,"id":"GVV7G9xD","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118442204,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)20:14:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"Kek rewards those who respect the balance between Order and Chaos.<br><br>Have hope, brothers.

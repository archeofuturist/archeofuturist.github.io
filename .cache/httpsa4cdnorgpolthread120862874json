E.g. there&#039;s no inherent evolutionary plan for stronger\/faster animals, but stronger\/faster animals may be more successful in their environment. This is what Darwin refers to as &#039;survival of the fittest&#039;, which isn&#039;t related to physical fitness but how well certain things individuals fit into their environment. <br><br>The more &#039;fit&#039; the individual, the more likely it will survive and be able to produce offspring which, due to the hereditary nature of passing genes, will also be fit to their environment. After many generations, you might find an entire population stemmed from a single individual with a particular trait which allowed it to survive better than it&#039;s competitors. <br><br>An example of this is a bottleneck evolutionary model. Imagine a disease wipes out 99% of a population like a mega-plague, but by chance of particular mutations in the genome 1% is unaffected. The result is that future populations will have stemmed from this 1%, driving a particular genotype for future populations differing them from their ancestors. This is kinda what happened to cheetahs. <br><br>Another type of evolution comes from isolated populations who adapt differently to suit their environment, e.g. Darwin&#039;s finches. Due to different abundancies of food in different islands there was an adaptive change in finch beaks over time. These finches came from a single population that would have had the same beak size. Random distributions of sizes m, however, would have been grounds for natural selection whereby a finch with a marginall smaller beak may have had more success to eat beetles for example. This increased fitness and so selection may have allowed smaller beaks to prevail over larger beaks, which may have been better for eating fruit but the fruit may have not been as abundant as beetles. Over time you get birds with smaller beaks on this island.","time":1492057878,"resto":120862874,"id":"h1ZaB8Qi","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":120867216,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)00:34:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120866834\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120866834<\/a><br>T. a biology\/genetics major that did lots of evolution electives. <br><br>Also on phone so ignore all dem typos and shieet","time":1492058077,"resto":120862874,"id":"h1ZaB8Qi","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":120867261,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)00:34:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120864732\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120864732<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;it will probably become more common<\/span><br>This is where it loses me.

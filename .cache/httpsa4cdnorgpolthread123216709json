Then, as the last one standing, she took over the reins and knifed almost all her predecessors favourites, except the most hated man in the country, Jeremy Hunt.

Recently I was on Facebook and saw her name, and thought to myself, hey she liked me years ago, and the only reason I wasn&#039;t interested then was because of her political views, so I might as well contact her and maybe become friends with her again, then see where things go from there, worst that can happen is she ignores me. But I do nothing because I&#039;m an autist retard who&#039;s scared of social interaction. I got a bit tipsy today to celebrate handing an assignment in, and decide to look her up on Facebook. I then find out she&#039;s deleted her profile, and very recently because at least a couple weeks ago I saw her name in the chat sidebar.<br><br>I missed my chance lads.","filename":"bggiughiyiuni","ext":".png","w":300,"h":300,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493401253585,"time":1493401253,"md5":"cKgONLqP11RLIiS+96kq5A==","fsize":53752,"resto":123216709,"id":"Ec9p7exj","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123220408,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)13:41:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123220238\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123220238<\/a><br>What&#039;s wrong with that, past and future colony?","time":1493401262,"resto":123216709,"id":"RzMh72Bz","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123220417,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)13:41:04","name":"The desert fox","com":"Really good","filename":"image","ext":".jpg","w":1240,"h":817,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":82,"tim":1493401264832,"time":1493401264,"md5":"oPY96aenb9Pt2EJ2VjUc0g==","fsize":80552,"resto":123216709,"id":"I1dylSBv","country":"GB","m_img":1,"trip":"!!2n6HRZ4KjiF","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123220481,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)13:41:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123220147\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123220147<\/a><br>She is a clueless chickenshit m8","time":1493401303,"resto":123216709,"id":"MBC0PiKa","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123220484,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)13:41:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123220323\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123220323<\/a><br>Grey, miserable and some trees.

Then, as the last one standing, she took over the reins and knifed almost all her predecessors favourites, except the most hated man in the country, Jeremy Hunt.

EU countries as the enemy. Some people would quite correctly see her as a major cause of division and a massive hypocrite. The reality is that she&#039;s clearly not a leader in any way. She&#039;s at best a figurehead. More accurately she&#039;s a ventriloquist dummy or a robot. She can only rhyme off the very limited number of stock phrases she&#039;s been given and tries to get by with only these no matter what carefully vetted and selected audience she talks at. She doesn&#039;t do questions as that would show her to be totally limited. There&#039;s no way the party managers that operate the Maybot 1.0 are ever going to allow her to take part in any radio or television debate for exactly the same reason.<br>In practice under the Maybot the Tories are more openly stealing the policies values and attitudes of organisations like BNP, EDL, Britain First. In other words, when she talks about strong and stable government what she means is vote for me to ensure you have a racist, xenophobic, hard right, fascist crew of ideologues making sure you get what you&#039;re given and controlling your life.<br>Oh let&#039;s not forget, centralising power in Westminster neutering any and all opposition including especially that pesky SNP government in Scotland. It&#039;s a dead cert that the Tories will make whatever changes needed to ensure the Scots will never be able to leave the U.K. and take their precious resources with them. But we&#039;ll still deluge them with propaganda telling them we subsidise them to the tune of \u00a315 billion every year.","time":1493402598,"resto":123216709,"id":"MBC0PiKa","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123222961,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)14:03:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123219868\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123219868<\/a><br><a href=\"#p123219984\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123219984<\/a><br><br>When does England get to vote on banning the Scots from voting?","time":1493402625,"resto":123216709,"id":"a43QrIx3","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123222976,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)14:03:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123222611\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123222611<\/a><br>Low testosterone won&#039;t get you far in the Spanish sex jungle m8","filename":"1491951620936","ext":".jpg","w":852,"h":1280,"tn_w":83,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493402631850,"time":1493402631,"md5":"O1f8B4kyvAJEyf9qV9mVrQ==","fsize":80789,"resto":123216709,"id":"zhiEX8fU","country":"IE","m_img":1,"country_name":"Ireland"},{"no":123223006,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)14:04:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123222561\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123222561<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Birmingham<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;remain<\/span>","time":1493402643,"resto":123216709,"id":"SIRFWe9V","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123223008,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)14:04:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123222920\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123222920<\/a><br>She is giving blow job to her Jewish Banker overlords","filename":"0 0E","ext":".jpg","w":634,"h":440,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":86,"tim":1493402643796,"time":1493402643,"md5":"ELHsz31cE\/U2nqeYXhLsjw==","fsize":47248,"resto":123216709,"id":"3f2sryxu","country":"ME","country_name":"Montenegro"},{"no":123223060,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)14:04:31","name":"The desert fox","com":"<a href=\"#p123222850\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123222850<\/a><br>Sorry our white girls cant resist big black mountain","filename":"image","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":852,"tn_w":93,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493402671337,"time":1493402671,"md5":"sFFGKkQp1o\/o8n2Uw6zOBQ==","fsize":63829,"resto":123216709,"id":"I1dylSBv","country":"GB","trip":"!!2n6HRZ4KjiF","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123223095,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)14:04:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123216895\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123216895<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;tfw live in Safe Labour Seat area<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Hillary Benn<\/span><br><br>Kill me now","time":1493402685,"resto":123216709,"id":"M0pP+q\/Y","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123223118,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)14:04:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123222850\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123222850<\/a><br>Borats got triggered","time":1493402699,"resto":123216709,"id":"MBC0PiKa","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123223124,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)14:05:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123222077\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123222077<\/a><br>the dutch boers chimped out because we wouldn&#039;t let them import non white slaves.

In 1923 he returned to (and later died in) Ballyshannon, County Donegal. In Ballyshannon Corscadden&#039;s wife, Sarah Margaret (n\u00e9e Lipsett), gave birth above the family&#039;s grocery shop to Blair&#039;s mother, Hazel.[16][17]<br><br>Blair has one elder brother, Sir William Blair, a High Court judge, and a younger sister, Sarah. Blair&#039;s first home was with his family at Paisley Terrace in the Willowbrae area of Edinburgh. During this period, his father worked as a junior tax inspector whilst also studying for a law degree from the University of Edinburgh.[12]<br><br>Blair&#039;s first relocation was when he was 19 months old. At the end of 1954 Blair&#039;s parents and their two sons moved from Paisley Terrace to Adelaide, South Australia.[18] His father lectured in law at the University of Adelaide.[19] It was when in Australia that Blair&#039;s sister Sarah was born. The Blairs lived in the suburb of Dulwich close to the university. The family returned to the UK in summer 1958. They lived for a time with Hazel&#039;s mother and stepfather (William McClay) at their home in Stepps on the outskirts of north east Glasgow. Blair&#039;s father took employment lecturing at Durham University thus moving the family to Durham, England. Aged five, this marked the beginning of a long association Blair was to have with Durham.[18]<br>Education","filename":"blair typing","ext":".jpg","w":620,"h":388,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":78,"tim":1493403655553,"time":1493403655,"md5":"aGAodgndleaqvWeiK293Nw==","fsize":38377,"resto":123216709,"id":"fW5shudJ","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123225091,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)14:21:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/123225060#p123225060\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123225060<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;123225060<\/span><br><a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/123225060#p123225060\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123225060<\/a><br><a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/123225060#p123225060\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123225060<\/a><br>new","time":1493403683,"resto":123216709,"id":"TUsg5EKT","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123225122,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)14:21:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123224224\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123224224<\/a><br>She will loose badly an the tory party will end up like ukip","time":1493403694,"resto":123216709,"id":"MBC0PiKa","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123225159,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)14:21:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123224624\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123224624<\/a><br>any paki with 5000 rupees could own labour, and probably do","time":1493403714,"resto":123216709,"id":"AA1Zlrk8","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123225170,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)14:22:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123224985\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123224985<\/a><br>the fact that he is incredibly obese is making his skin stretch all over his body and become thin and easily broken which makes him susceptible to sores etc. also he spends all of his day lying down. its not actually a blood flow problem its just a fat fuck problem","time":1493403721,"resto":123216709,"id":"uEbvXET7","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123225220,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)14:22:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123223225\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123223225<\/a><br>Like Blair and Brown, Fuck off.

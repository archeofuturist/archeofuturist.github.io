If you have a poor person making $1,000 and he loses 20% to VAT he wont have much left. With graduated income tax, a poor person making $1,000 wouldn&#039;t be taxed at all. I suppose some of that is alleviated if you tax food less but its still the same because it is essentally a flat tax. I know many people who want to abolish sales tax altogether.","time":1493628725,"resto":123589570,"id":"CKXp+tI\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123598266,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)04:52:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123597443\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123597443<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;https:\/\/www.avito.ru\/volgograd\/kva<wbr>rtiry\/1-k_kvartira_27_m_89_et._8775<wbr>75952<\/span><br> <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;mfw when I get 500 dollars from Uncle Same every month.<\/span>","filename":"1479804425515","ext":".png","w":420,"h":420,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493628728696,"time":1493628728,"md5":"XbNQGLF+UnprlnsgB0rcXg==","fsize":9326,"resto":123589570,"id":"Iftl1d1s","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123598276,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)04:52:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123598085\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123598085<\/a><br>Its better than nigger infested American cities and if you have money you will practically be living in first world conditions with 3rd world pricing","time":1493628747,"resto":123589570,"id":"Esvqs3Jz","country":"IN","country_name":"India"},{"no":123598305,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)04:52:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123589570\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123589570<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;1 kilogram of pork costs 9$<\/span><br>$6 for me<br>$200-per-month reporting in","time":1493628777,"resto":123589570,"id":"6ddChXUl","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":123598332,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)04:53:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123591232\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123591232<\/a><br>I lived in Russia for two years.

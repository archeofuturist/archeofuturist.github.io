Everything is currently calm but you never know what the future might bring you, so establishing the means to secure your trade will allow you to be really independent and not worry about potential economy-crashing blockades if you happened to offend the big bully USA. <br><br>This is the US strategy as well - keep domination over the seas so nations are forced to behave good with you, else they get sanctioned or blockaded. The problem with that doctrine comes when those nations start establishing land trade routes between themselves (or even export oil via pipes), bypassing your carriers. Suddenly you start seeing why the US is sperging out so much about Ukraine and attempted to convert them into a US puppet - if EU-Russian relations mend and there&#039;s nothing sitting between them on the border then not only will Russians export even more of their stuff by land, but also both China and EU will fund tens of &quot;Trans-Siberian Railroad&quot;-like projects to connect China&#039;s economy to the EU, having both the EU and China bypass sea at the same time. The end result of this is that your blockades are now inefficient while the rest of the world just became fuckbuddies. This is why stuff keeps (((happening))) in key regions that connect trade, like EE and the ME. <br><br>Here&#039;s a prediction - US will try to pull the buffer behind Ukraine and try to form a US-friendly anti-EU alliance from Eastern Europe (i.e &quot;Visegrad Group&quot;, which will extend to Romania and Bulgaria soon, or what poles call &quot;intermarium&quot;) so they can keep the EU and Asia separated. Also, Japan will soon reinstate their army and launch several Japanese carrier groups by 2040.","time":1493443665,"resto":123297988,"id":"dHXWookB","country":"BG","country_name":"Bulgaria"},{"no":123301098,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)01:38:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123298387\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123298387<\/a><br>kek wills the death of the Chyneses","filename":"Garfield","ext":".gif","w":640,"h":360,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1493444323669,"time":1493444323,"md5":"SvlWUNK6ZgqdXVs+uACXtg==","fsize":402326,"resto":123297988,"id":"R0T8759r","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123302324,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)01:53:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"Fishing waters.

Again, in nearly every case, the same one-way adjustments have been made, to show warming up to 1 degree C or more higher than was indicated by the data that was actually recorded.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Of much more serious significance, however, is the way this wholesale manipulation of the official temperature record \u2014 for reasons GHCN and Giss have never plausibly explained \u2014 has become the real elephant in the room of the greatest and most costly scare the world has known.

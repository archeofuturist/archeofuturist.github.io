Again, in nearly every case, the same one-way adjustments have been made, to show warming up to 1 degree C or more higher than was indicated by the data that was actually recorded.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Of much more serious significance, however, is the way this wholesale manipulation of the official temperature record \u2014 for reasons GHCN and Giss have never plausibly explained \u2014 has become the real elephant in the room of the greatest and most costly scare the world has known.

The explanation is relatively straightforward. NCDC assumes that the current set of instruments recording temperature is accurate, so any time of observation changes or PHA-adjustments are done relative to current temperatures. Because breakpoints are detected through pair-wise comparisons, new data coming in may slightly change the magnitude of recent adjustments by providing a more comprehensive difference series between neighboring stations.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;When breakpoints are removed, the entire record prior to the breakpoint is adjusted up or down depending on the size and direction of the breakpoint. This means that slight modifications of recent breakpoints will impact all past temperatures at the station in question though a constant offset. The alternative to this would be to assume that the original data is accurate, and adjusted any new data relative to the old data (e.g. adjust everything in front of breakpoints rather than behind them). From the perspective of calculating trends over time, these two approaches are identical, and its not clear that there is necessarily a preferred option.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Hopefully this (and the following two articles) should help folks gain a better understanding of the issues in the surface temperature network and the steps scientists have taken to try to address them. These approaches are likely far from perfect, and it is certainly possible that the underlying algorithms could be improved to provide more accurate results.<\/span>","time":1493014657,"resto":122542197,"id":"p\/4yejQK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122552655,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)02:18:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122552527\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122552527<\/a><br>that wasn&#039;t what i was talking about. you said that more species are currently nearly extinct than ever before in history, i asked if that data accounts for us knowing of more species. answer the question.","time":1493014720,"resto":122542197,"id":"66Ig9N49","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":122552754,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)02:19:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122552351\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122552351<\/a><br>Get some cyanide in your system and report back.","time":1493014782,"resto":122542197,"id":"90mmzv9h","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":122552817,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)02:20:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122552408\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122552408<\/a><br>Why would you want to increase that number more?<br><br>An example would be the crown of thorns star fish here in Australia.

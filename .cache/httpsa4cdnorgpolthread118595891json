The Asian eyelid almond shape is extremely dominant and never lost no matter how many generations have passed but the single eyelid part becomes less common. Everyone is fair skinned and carry features from their base race(more on that later) People of color are a minority due to a strange epidemic that happen a few centuries ago, as more children born to them start to become lighter and lighter. Scientist speculate its due to the more indoor environment with cooler temperatures and less sunlight we&#039;ve developed affecting the melanin levels in everyone. &quot;Sub&quot; races are a new way to categorize people, because although these people might be &quot;white&quot; in skin color they still belong to their base race. What separated people in your time is color and culture, but in future all culture endlessly mixed due to the communication and ease of transportation around the world, it is now possible to live in Maine, then go to work in Hawaii and be back by dinner. There are now 72 states in the United Western Hemisphere with ten territories on Mars. Anyways both the diversify everything! side and white supremacist side lose and end up with everyone being this way. Also Martians are weird, they are what the Puerto Rico people are to you now.","filename":"ESSE- 2417-03-27 at 18.18.42","ext":".jpg","w":606,"h":653,"tn_w":232,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490666475490,"time":1490666475,"md5":"Ir2pHUzeWZJah9OWZEGXyA==","fsize":134938,"resto":0,"id":"SpHsAdir","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"hey-guys-here-from-2717-so-basically-in-future","country_name":"United States","replies":3,"images":0,"unique_ips":4},{"no":118596322,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)22:05:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118595891\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118595891<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;2717<\/span><br>Bullshit, the universe is supposed to end sometime around 2500","time":1490666715,"resto":118595891,"id":"OwBrVEr5","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118596896,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)22:10:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Western United Hemisphere <\/span><br>Wew lads not only do we take over Mexico and Canada but the whole fucking half of the earth?!","time":1490667038,"resto":118595891,"id":"M6aHYxPV","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118596988,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)22:11:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118595891\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118595891<\/a><br>what happens to the arabs and islam?","time":1490667090,"resto":118595891,"id":"LRaT4LDu","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

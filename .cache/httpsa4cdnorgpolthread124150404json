Use your brain for five seconds.<br><br>All of these guys who work for and around politicians have stories about illegal or strange shit that goes on behind the scenes. Stories that can&#039;t be confirmed but still manage to get passed around Washington DC. Stories of bill clinton&#039;s exploits with women swirled around for years before he ever officially got busted. People have talked shit about Bern Sanders and the wacky ideas he has for years. The clinton foundation has never been 100% busted but still tons of rumors float around about what happens behind the scenes.<br> I am sure that Trump has heard some crazy rumors during his campaign, some of it true and some of it false.","filename":"1490816397932","ext":".jpg","w":159,"h":175,"tn_w":113,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493952206574,"time":1493952206,"md5":"6JpglXO+NYnT9rttidJpwA==","fsize":9167,"resto":124150404,"id":"Wd66s\/Zx","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

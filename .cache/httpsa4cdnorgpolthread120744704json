Are Slavs a race? <br> I have to point out that US, South Slavs are most probably of illyrian and Thracian decent, but some generic Slavic marks are found all over the place. I found Russians who have exact facial marks as some people form here. That is even more obvious on women than men. <br><br>For example I have most Dinaric (noric) skull and body that you can find. I am 190 cm tall, I have gray-blue eyes and dark brown hair with that blond shine that you can see in the sun, my beard though is mostly blond. Thos hair traits you can find all over the Europe. But I am fully aware of my &#039;&#039;Vlah&#039;&#039; or &#039;&#039;Krajisnik&#039;&#039; face (nose, skull, eyes position, cheeks) and I think I look a lot different than a Bosniak or a Croat from the same region of Bosnia.. (Even though Bosniaks are NOT a really ethnic group). Few months ago I ran on a Russian guy who looks like a brother of my. I assure you the dude looked exactly like me. We both realized that and took a picture.

So about 15 years ago they created new language branch called &quot;balto slavic language group&quot; and placed lithuanian along with latvian languages in it even though baltic languages have no relation to slavic languages. Later on here in lithuania they started massive slavification, trying to remove letters from lithuanian alphabet, orwelling surnames, creating unisex last names, changing century old traditions about female names, etc etc.. The future never been so bleak for lithuanian language. In comparison to CIA gestapo communists were treating lithuanian language like guardian angels.","time":1491997044,"resto":120744704,"id":"VvNi5Yxz","country":"LT","country_name":"Lithuania"},{"no":120745537,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)07:37:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"And the Dinarics in your country have NOTHING to do with Illyrians.<br><br>Every single Illyrian LARPER should be forcefully killed.","filename":"Subclades my man","ext":".png","w":795,"h":613,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":96,"tim":1491997053278,"time":1491997053,"md5":"cZRSA1IXZxvIorszgmrA3g==","fsize":69979,"resto":120744704,"id":"KHMoPwrQ","country":"RS","country_name":"Serbia"},{"no":120745633,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)07:39:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"And of course Slavs are not a race.","filename":"1490625959132","ext":".png","w":887,"h":609,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":85,"tim":1491997140371,"time":1491997140,"md5":"KbQ4m9Ud1NOgq\/dl0i+bwA==","fsize":93754,"resto":120744704,"id":"KHMoPwrQ","country":"RS","country_name":"Serbia"},{"no":120745989,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)07:43:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120745526\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120745526<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;started massive slavification<\/span><br>How are you posting from the 1300s, anon?","time":1491997406,"resto":120744704,"id":"djypNeRT","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120746372,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)07:47:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120745989\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120745989<\/a><br>what is the half-life of the nation being attacked by nation building weapons of mass destruction?

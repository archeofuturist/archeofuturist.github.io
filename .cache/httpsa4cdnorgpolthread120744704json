Are Slavs a race? <br> I have to point out that US, South Slavs are most probably of illyrian and Thracian decent, but some generic Slavic marks are found all over the place. I found Russians who have exact facial marks as some people form here. That is even more obvious on women than men. <br><br>For example I have most Dinaric (noric) skull and body that you can find. I am 190 cm tall, I have gray-blue eyes and dark brown hair with that blond shine that you can see in the sun, my beard though is mostly blond. Thos hair traits you can find all over the Europe. But I am fully aware of my &#039;&#039;Vlah&#039;&#039; or &#039;&#039;Krajisnik&#039;&#039; face (nose, skull, eyes position, cheeks) and I think I look a lot different than a Bosniak or a Croat from the same region of Bosnia.. (Even though Bosniaks are NOT a really ethnic group). Few months ago I ran on a Russian guy who looks like a brother of my. I assure you the dude looked exactly like me. We both realized that and took a picture.

So about 15 years ago they created new language branch called &quot;balto slavic language group&quot; and placed lithuanian along with latvian languages in it even though baltic languages have no relation to slavic languages. Later on here in lithuania they started massive slavification, trying to remove letters from lithuanian alphabet, orwelling surnames, creating unisex last names, changing century old traditions about female names, etc etc.. The future never been so bleak for lithuanian language. In comparison to CIA gestapo communists were treating lithuanian language like guardian angels.","time":1491997044,"resto":120744704,"id":"VvNi5Yxz","country":"LT","country_name":"Lithuania"},{"no":120745537,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)07:37:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"And the Dinarics in your country have NOTHING to do with Illyrians.<br><br>Every single Illyrian LARPER should be forcefully killed.","filename":"Subclades my man","ext":".png","w":795,"h":613,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":96,"tim":1491997053278,"time":1491997053,"md5":"cZRSA1IXZxvIorszgmrA3g==","fsize":69979,"resto":120744704,"id":"KHMoPwrQ","country":"RS","country_name":"Serbia"},{"no":120745633,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)07:39:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"And of course Slavs are not a race.","filename":"1490625959132","ext":".png","w":887,"h":609,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":85,"tim":1491997140371,"time":1491997140,"md5":"KbQ4m9Ud1NOgq\/dl0i+bwA==","fsize":93754,"resto":120744704,"id":"KHMoPwrQ","country":"RS","country_name":"Serbia"},{"no":120745989,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)07:43:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120745526\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120745526<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;started massive slavification<\/span><br>How are you posting from the 1300s, anon?","time":1491997406,"resto":120744704,"id":"djypNeRT","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120746372,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)07:47:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120745989\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120745989<\/a><br>what is the half-life of the nation being attacked by nation building weapons of mass destruction?

To draw upon Mussolini&#039;s ideas, the idea of constructing a pan-slavic myth upon biological ideas of purity is absurd. The umbrella term &quot;slavic&quot; is not a denominator of a biological race and does pertain to a language group. This is as correct as it can get. Personally I would like to see a pan-slavic movement which abridges the catholic and orthodox divisions of 1054 after the great schism and ultimately starts to rehabilitate slavic identity through bilateral and multilateral reconciliation. Learning from the past, knowing what works and what doesn&#039;t, an informal yet confederated alliance based on autonomy might be possible. It would be glorious.","filename":"1491521114471","ext":".png","w":553,"h":702,"tn_w":98,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492010058470,"time":1492010058,"md5":"uWbe\/jnt7Do3Qg1ndcHkaQ==","fsize":157663,"resto":120744704,"id":"cD51Yy73","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":120765958,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)11:15:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120765409\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120765409<\/a><br>Bosnians are closer to Moldovans or Fyromians in terms of being a made up ethnicity.<br><br>Also a complimentary<br>Sweden<br>Yes<br>to you since I can tell you&#039;re carrying marxism in your soul","time":1492010112,"resto":120744704,"id":"6+t3Y9P0","country":"LT","country_name":"Lithuania"},{"no":120766064,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)11:16:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120744704\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120744704<\/a><br>Sometimes when I hear what cucks in Germany, Sweden and sometimes even US say, I feel not just like some different race, but a whole different specie.

You Swedes don&#039;t know what it means to grow up in a country with a muslim majority. Pro tip: It&#039;s not fun.<br>What it means when the local muslim warlord has the right to fuck every Catholic women prior to her marriage. This was the case for more than 400 years. The only way to keep the bloodline clean from the Ottomans was total isolation or murder. And believe me there was a lot of murder. Many Croats would rather take the risk and kill a high ranking Ottoman than let them fuck their daughters. Almost all Croats in the Dalmatia and the Hercegovina were so called &quot;Hajduk&#039;s&quot;, which is the turkish word for rebel.<br>They were basically medieval guerrilla groups who would rob and murder Ottoman supply garrisons. A leader of a local Hajduk group was the &quot;Harambasa&quot;. <br>Murders were committed even during times of so called &quot;peace&quot;, i.e. after the Ottomans were defeated by the Austrians, before WWI, during the time of the State of the Slovenes Croats and Serbs, during the Kingdom Yugoslavia and during the Communist Yugoslavia. <br>And it went through every instance of society.<br>This also led to some absurd situations in hindsight.<br>When Ali fought Frazier or Foreman all the Croats of Bosnia were against Ali. In the six-day war Croats were for Israel. Even today most of them are Zionists. At least those who I know. And not because they believe that Israel has a right to own this land, but simply because the hate Muslims. And so on and so on.<br>The younger generations are unfortunately bluepilled af.

Expecting a diasporafag to be at peace with his past is not realistic, after all he didn&#039;t become a diasporafag because he liked it. He was forced to become a diasporafag. And once you are a diasporafag, and lets assume for one moment you are not a complete idiot, you will not go back. Why would you? You&#039;d have to go back and live right next to the same fuckers you hate so much. And those fucks have no problem living in a country that is a huge pile of shit, after all that&#039;s what they are too. At the same time if you are not a complete idiot or radical you will take the opportunity you were given and try to make the best out of your situation. Although I don&#039;t like the fact that I&#039;m a diasporafag I still appreciate my parents effort to bring me into a better world and give me the opportunity to grow up in a peaceful country. But when we, the diasporafags, are starting to read and see the same idiotic rhetoric of some &quot;brotherhood&quot; between muslims and the local population of our new found homelands that led to the wars in the first place, it&#039;s pretty normal that our PTSD will come through. <br>So yeah, asking a diasporafag his opinion on a topic like this is probably not the best thing to do. On the other hand it&#039;s probably also no the best thing for a diasporafag to answer to threads like these, cause it will only trigger him and make his blood pressure go up.","filename":"1485286356024","ext":".gif","w":188,"h":174,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":115,"tim":1492023301964,"time":1492023301,"md5":"eVPWAsPOAU7znK8CY3I7wA==","fsize":485150,"resto":120744704,"id":"oRhempli","country":"AT","country_name":"Austria"},{"no":120791511,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)14:56:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120791365\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120791365<\/a><br>Die.","time":1492023380,"resto":120744704,"id":"PaELq0ge","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":120791714,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)14:58:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120791365\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120791365<\/a><br>alright m8 chill out, I just thought it was funny. hope your country stops being a shithole soon.<br><br><a href=\"#p120791511\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120791511<\/a><br>t. destroyer of Europe","time":1492023480,"resto":120744704,"id":"P7Jcm\/Z\/","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":120791801,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)14:58:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120791057\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120791057<\/a><br><a href=\"#p120791352\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120791352<\/a><br>You will get fucked anally when the war comes xD <a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/120774072#p120774072\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120774072<\/a>","time":1492023519,"resto":120744704,"id":"BTDtPUED","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":120791853,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)14:59:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120790904\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120790904<\/a><br>Crimea is whatever, dozens of different peoples were there.

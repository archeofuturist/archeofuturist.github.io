Apparently there are 4 mosques in Limerick now and Ireland&#039;s first Islamic clothes shop.<br><br>How fucked is Limerick? Just when we sorted out criminality and gangland murders here, we get infested with Islamists.<br><br>Is this situation being replicated across the country, or is it a Limerick phenomenon primarily?

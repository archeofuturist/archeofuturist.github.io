The polish began carrying out pogroms against ethnic Germans in the Danzig region, to the point that ethnic Germans were flowing over the border into Germany like they are today from Africa\/Mid East. Ultimately, roughly 90,000 ethnic Germans would be killed in these pogroms in the Danzig region. HItler knew he faced a very difficult decision. He could invade the Danzig region and liberate the ethnic Germans from the pogroms, knowing full well that France and Britian would declare war. Or, he could continue to let the pogroms go on. In the end, he made the decision to invade, and France and Britian declared war. <br><br><br>That is the rundown on the very last few moments leading up to WWII. I can&#039;t give you the entire lesson going back further in time on other catalysts leading up to WWII because that would take way too long.

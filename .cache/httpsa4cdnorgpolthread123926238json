Recently suffered a miscarriage and had to feel what it was like for my child to die inside of me and not be able to do anything about it. Have a cousin who at the same time obviously went out and had an abortion, ever since has turned into an insufferable Social Justice Cunt. To me it is so obvious she is acting this way to try and mentally deal with the trauma she put herself through. She is clearly out there trying to project herself as a hero as a way to deal with her own guilt. You can&#039;t feel a life die inside of you die like that and not have it change you folks. Anytime I see an overly sensitive social justice cunt these days I can only wonder how many of them have had an abortion, or how many abortions have they had? Abortion is clearly damaging to the womans psyche, and it is even more damaging when they weren&#039;t expecting to feel anything about it because they were told it wasn&#039;t really a life. Once they feel this they subconsciously label themselves as murderers and it drives them crazy. It is my theory that for many of these women once they have this enter their subconscious they feel like they CAN&#039;T act feminine any more because the pure female persona is not one who murders her own child. They then start to act more manly and try to find ways to be a hero while having no idea what that actually means because women weren&#039;t meant to be heros men were. The outcome of abortion leads to the mentally deranged society of women we have created today. Am I wrong POL?","filename":"baloon noose","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":500,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493826997475,"time":1493826997,"md5":"PEQDAEO0FX0yeso9zGq8YA==","fsize":26830,"resto":0,"id":"iquhBUwG","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"abortion-is-evil-and-is-becoming-the-undoing-of","country_name":"United States","replies":21,"images":2,"unique_ips":12},{"no":123926442,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)11:58:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Anytime I see an overly sensitive social justice cunt these days I can only wonder how many of them have had an abortion, or how many abortions have they had?<\/span><br>I&#039;m sure the percentage is close to 90%.

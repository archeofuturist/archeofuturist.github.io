The Orbital Ring that he conceived of can be built today, with existing technology. In addition to terrestrial transportation, the Orbital Ring would drastically reduce the cost of sending payloads to space, from $2000\/kg to $1\/kg.<br><br>This would enable your childhood dreams to become real. Terraforming and colonies on the Moon and Mars. Middle class families could take vacations on another planet. An end to climate change through space-based solar power. The project would pay for itself many times over by mining asteroids, and selling space-based solar power to the world. <br><br>Massive economic growth.<br><br>Tax cuts<br><br>Basic income<br><br>We can do it all.

And not taking into account the effects of general gravitation to relative time. You may spend 1 day to reach mars according to your own refference system but on earth, time flows way faster relatively, that 1 day trip in the ship -&gt; many months passed on earth.

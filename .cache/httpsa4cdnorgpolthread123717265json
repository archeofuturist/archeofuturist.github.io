If a civil war actually starts it will come from one of the riots spiraling into an actual multi-day battle that brings a city to its knees. The media will drum up support for the rioters, sparking tension across the country. If we have another civil war it won&#039;t be as &quot;tidy&quot; as the last one where we at least had boundaries. It will instead be the cesspools of multiculturalism, poverty and crime in cities across the country finally coming to a head and collapsing on themselves. From there, things could rapidly deteriorate. Leftists would have the catalyst they need to formally organize into literal marxist revolutionaries (globalist pawn army). Conservatived would quickly organize and remind the world why they fought so hard for their second amendment. Its anyones guess what happens next. That is what Trump has to prevent. But of course the minute he sends in federal firepower to keep something from boiling over in one of these riots, is the minute the media has the ammo to say &quot;SEE TOLD YOU HE WAS AN EBIL FASCIST DICTATOR&quot;.

The focus on CO2 is stupid tho, there are other factors like deforestation and shit in the seas that compound the problem.<br><br>You want the red pill on this? It is too late to do anything. It has been too late for decades and they people still acting like anything can be done are either trying to cash in or fooling themselves.<br><br>The ice is melting faster and faster. We are ahead of the worst case projections by decades already and it keeps speeding up. If Iceland goes the coastal cities are all underwater, If the antarctic goes, hope you have moved inland for your children and grandchildren&#039;s sake. The water tables will be fucked by salt, storms will get much worse, all that good shit. <br><br>Then the arctic permafrost will melt in the north. There is so much methane locked up in the permafrost it will make all this CO2 panic a fond memory. Methane is so much more effective a greenhouse gas, and there is so much of it up there. Humans will never see ice caps again after that point. It would take another cataclysmic impact event to cloud the skies and choke out the sun for the earth to cool again.<br><br>But hey, on the up side we get a fresh new landmass to explore. So I am, and would recommend you, try is to move inland and to the north, Get away from any area with bad weather as it will only get worse. Get to a rural area with a good local food production system and set up shop. Then start grooming your children and eventually grandchildren to be explorers and with a little luck you can get something in the new antarctic continent with your family&#039;s name on it.","time":1490424428,"resto":118193083,"id":"rJlomRkd","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118197668,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)02:52:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118193083\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118193083<\/a><br>One single active volcano pollutes way more than humans ever did. <br>Humans changing climate is bullshit<br>Scientists can&#039;t even predict the climate correctly in my town for the week, how can they claim to be able to predict the climate for the whole planet in decades to come?

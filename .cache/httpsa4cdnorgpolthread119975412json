Additionally, Grasshopper provides a very flexible language to define rules that are used to &quot;perform a pre-installation survey of the target device, assuring that the payload will only [be] installed if the target has the right configuration&quot;. Through this grammar CIA operators are able to build from very simple to very complex logic used to determine, for example, if the target device is running a specific version of Microsoft Windows, or if a particular Antivirus product is running or not.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Grasshopper allows tools to be installed using a variety of persistence mechanisms and modified using a variety of extensions (like encryption). The requirement list of the Automated Implant Branch (AIB) for Grasshopper puts special attention on PSP avoidance, so that any Personal Security Products like &#039;MS Security Essentials&#039;, &#039;Rising&#039;, &#039;Symantec Endpoint&#039; or &#039;Kaspersky IS&#039; on target machines do not detect Grasshopper elements.<\/span>","filename":"freeassangeposter","ext":".jpg","w":1240,"h":1748,"tn_w":177,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491582187706,"time":1491582187,"md5":"pJaWRNL1JD6G7N\/PXtJKew==","fsize":341247,"resto":0,"id":"g8iiJSP7","country":"AU","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"happening-new-vault-7-leak","country_name":"Australia","replies":14,"images":6,"unique_ips":10},{"no":119975744,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)12:24:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"don&#039;t use Windows lads. <br><br>arch based Linux \u3060\u3051","time":1491582295,"resto":119975412,"id":"AwJDAc66","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119975958,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)12:26:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119975412\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119975412<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;One of the persistence mechanisms used by the CIA here is &#039;Stolen Goods&#039; - whose &quot;components were taken from malware known as Carberp, a suspected Russian organized crime rootkit.&quot; confirming the recycling of malware found on the Internet by the CIA. &quot;The source of Carberp was published online, and has allowed AED\/RDB to easily steal components as needed from the malware.&quot;.

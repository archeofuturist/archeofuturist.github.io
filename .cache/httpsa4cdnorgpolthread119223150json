Ted says that internet research is unacceptable. Its seems Ted is suggesting that the information being put out from these organizations is just propaganda, as opposed to medical research of quality. <br><br>To answer the question: What he is saying appears to be mostly correct. However I do not think the correlation between paraylsis and age is strictly proportional. It is not clear that the older you are when you get infected, the higher the chance of paralyis. It is better described as: Unborn children and infants are unlikely to be paralysed (due to maternal antibodies), but all adults seem to have similar rates of paralysis (higher than infants).","time":1491156937,"resto":119223150,"id":"NUXY6uNp","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119227255,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)14:20:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119226424\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119226424<\/a><br>That was a good read.

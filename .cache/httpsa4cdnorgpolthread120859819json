There&#039;s a huge spirtual concept in Christianity that many people don&#039;t do because it very difficult. The Self-indulgence, earthly feelings and the devil play a big theme in sinning. If one person wants to be close as Jesus Christ is live he has to remove his self-indulgences and start feeling\/thinking how the world works in gods way. The world can be seen as a obstacle course made by god, for you to be traversed. It also learnd you not to look at the physical side of things but it is all about the soul. One may look good, be kind and funny but is his soul pure? The only one who knows is god, someone who acts very cold and isn&#039;t really friendly, maybe his soul is good, who knows? Only god. We must learn to stop taking direct roots to judge if someone is good or bad, and let god do it.

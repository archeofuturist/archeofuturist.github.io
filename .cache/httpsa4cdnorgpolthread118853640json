Things like anxiety and depression can be treated with either medication or non medicated therapy or a combination of both. Things like bipolar disorder often need some medication. Things like organization or time management or other personal skills usually don&#039;t need medication. Non medicated therapy isn&#039;t necessarily useless. Some forms like CBT and dialectical behavioral therapy are quite useful. The key is remembering the strategies you learn in the sessions.","time":1490832321,"resto":118853640,"id":"2liowu4k","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118854461,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)20:06:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118853640\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118853640<\/a><br>This shit really works.","time":1490832418,"resto":118853640,"id":"08rO6Ngi","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118854505,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)20:07:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118853640\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118853640<\/a><br>Don&#039;t fall for the pharmaceutical jew.

Enter your height and weight and check the average number of calories you consume each day. Now that you know your calorie output, calculate your calorie input. Before eating something, count the number of calories it could have by googling up the calories present in that recipe along with measuring the weight of the food. If you don&#039;t find the number of calories in that recipe or are not sure if it&#039;s accurate, find out what basic ingredients are going into that recipe and add up the calories. Finally add up the total calories consumed each day and try to minimize it. As long as it more than your total calories output, you will increase your weight and decrease if vice versa. For every 7000 calories deficit, you lose a kg or roughly close to 2 pounds. A 1000 calorie deficit every day is very much possible without going to gym. That means you could realistically lose close to 2 pounds or 1 kg each weak without toooo much effort","time":1492514018,"resto":121670074,"id":"s2rhoXmX","country":"IN","country_name":"India"},{"no":121671720,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)07:13:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121671231\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121671231<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Quit being a faggot, and actually go work out.<\/span><br><br>But thats wrong. <br>You lose weight by dieting, not exercising. <br><br>Calorie expended on exercise is a smaller portion of overall for that day, while calories not ingested in a diet is a larger portion.<br>When starting a workout regiment you will expand maybe 200-300 calories.

Enter your height and weight and check the average number of calories you consume each day. Now that you know your calorie output, calculate your calorie input. Before eating something, count the number of calories it could have by googling up the calories present in that recipe along with measuring the weight of the food. If you don&#039;t find the number of calories in that recipe or are not sure if it&#039;s accurate, find out what basic ingredients are going into that recipe and add up the calories. Finally add up the total calories consumed each day and try to minimize it. As long as it more than your total calories output, you will increase your weight and decrease if vice versa. For every 7000 calories deficit, you lose a kg or roughly bit more than 2 pounds. A 1000 calorie deficit every day is very much possible without going to gym(even more if you weigh more than 100 kg or 200+ pounds).

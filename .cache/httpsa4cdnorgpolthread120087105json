BECAUSE IT\u2019S TRUMP\u2019s AGENDA, NOT BANNON\u2019S. President Trump uses HIS advisers to get HIS agenda to reality; President Trump\u2019s agenda is not the agenda of his advisers.

If Bannon is gone, I&#039;m jumping ship. That doesn&#039;t mean I&#039;ll vote for a primary opponent (if that happens), or a Democrat in 2020, but I&#039;ll be thoroughly disgusted with Trump.","time":1491626806,"resto":120087105,"id":"RoZjkmeH","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120088677,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)00:52:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120087105\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120087105<\/a><br>Fuck off faggot","filename":"Ckucksner","ext":".jpg","w":567,"h":319,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1491627130459,"time":1491627130,"md5":"MQ4SY91uuXhQJAG2i8q\/7A==","fsize":148940,"resto":120087105,"id":"PQ39nHKr","country":"PT","country_name":"Portugal"},{"no":120088779,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)00:53:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120087512\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120087512<\/a><br>You can tell who the allies and enemies of the Jew are by who he demonizes and preaches against.","time":1491627182,"resto":120087105,"id":"zLc+OAnl","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120090973,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)01:13:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120087105\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120087105<\/a><br><br>The problem with that is that by dumping Bannon less than a hundred days into his term while globalist - often cases liberal- Jews arrive at the White House by the fucking busload, it shows he has no fucking core at all.<br><br>What fucking law and order?

The Democrats clearly think this is a big win, and they\u2019re confident they can block Trump\u2019s agenda after this spending bill for the rest of Trump\u2019s term. There isn\u2019t anything of the president\u2019s agenda in this budget, and people are beginning to ask, when\u2019s that gonna happen? If you\u2019re gonna shut it down in September, why not now?\u201d<\/span><br><br>Limbaugh is 100% right, Republicans got hosed on the budget and have squandered their momentum.","filename":"trump_100_-_100_photos_91992_c0-345-3716-2511_s885x516","ext":".jpg","w":885,"h":516,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":145,"tim":1493873582496,"time":1493873582,"md5":"9WsJKaYc7RjsvAI4M1bORw==","fsize":40695,"resto":0,"id":"wjeaceqD","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"limbaugh-grills-pence-on-budget","country_name":"United States","replies":9,"images":3,"unique_ips":4},{"no":124020883,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)00:54:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"Republicants are a mess.","filename":"Johnsonbrows","ext":".jpg","w":1000,"h":530,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":66,"tim":1493873643580,"time":1493873643,"md5":"UUuCpiaQPayet\/cznXv+VQ==","fsize":253052,"resto":124020784,"id":"33+YBNf6","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124021029,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)00:55:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124020784\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124020784<\/a><br>This is essentially the Hillary Clinton budget: 95% democrat objectives, plus a bunch of military spending we can waste bombing the middle east.<br><br>By the way, those great wall pictures?

They failed to spot the approaching ISIS army, and abandoned their positions to save themselves.<br>Lastly, the total fighting force of the SAA and allies in Palmyra at the time were less than 1500, while the attacking ISIS force numbered more than 4000 and included tanks and ifvs. The force holding Palmyra was not in any position to fight off such an attack. Additionally, the terrain around Palmyra does not lend itself well to any defence, being in a bowl, overlooked by a mountain. <br>Knowing this, the SAA withdrew to the T4 airbase, where proper fortifications awaited them.

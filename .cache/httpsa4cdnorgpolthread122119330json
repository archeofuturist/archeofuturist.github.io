Anyone experiencing mood changes during pill use should contact their medical provider.4<br><br>A study of 90 women published in Human Mapping in 2015 found that use of the birth control pill was associated with smaller cortical thickness measurements in the lateral orbitofrontal cortex and the posterior cingulate cortex. These areas of the brain are linked with reward response and evaluating incoming stimuli.8<br><br>The authors of the study write that further research needs to be conducted to confirm whether or not there is a connection between cortical thinning in these areas of the brain, mood changes and birth control pill use. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Decreased libido<\/span><br> The hormone(s) in the contraceptive pill can affect sex drive (libido) in some people. However, many other factors can contribute to a decrease in libido. If decreased libido persists and is bothersome, this should be discussed with a medical provider.4<br><br>In some instances, however, the birth control pill can increase libido. Such an increase may be due to the relief of painful symptoms such as menstrual cramping, premenstrual syndrome, endometriosis and uterine fibroids.9 <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Missed periods<\/span>","time":1492768506,"resto":122119330,"id":"f15FwRbG","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":122119642,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)05:55:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122119330\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122119330<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Birth pills are essentially HORMONES.

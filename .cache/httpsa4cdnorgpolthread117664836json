All foolish financial innovation comes with a story that makes it sound reasonable no matter how stupid it actually is. The story that supported interest-only lending was that you would overstretch yourself initially,paying more for a house than you could ever afford on a repayment basis. However, house prices would increase and your earnings would rise and in due course you would be able to switch to a repayment mortgage now available at a more affordable mortgage interest rate as aresult of house price inflation having altered the loan to value on your mortgage in your favour as the house price rose whilst your mortgage debt remained constant.Once enough people succumb to this logic house prices will respond. If you choose to finance your purchase of a house with an interest-only mortgage and you make no provision for repaying the mortgage then you can afford to pay much more for the same house than someone seeking to finance their purchase with a repayment mortgage. Hence house prices rise and prudent aspiring home-buyers find that their prudence excludes them from the market<\/span><br>Jesus fucking Christ.","filename":"1486272240296","ext":".jpg","w":620,"h":400,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":80,"tim":1490127574432,"time":1490127574,"md5":"0fvrj4RsJvHzeWxqqe4ujw==","fsize":47117,"resto":117664836,"id":"06fV\/7jh","country":"GB","trip":"!!80w9cz1G8ZX","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":117665166,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)16:21:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"Only just remembered this story happened<br><br>people spray painted CUNT on a horse","filename":"kek","ext":".png","w":623,"h":558,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":111,"tim":1490127662951,"time":1490127662,"md5":"bwfeiS6OUtAIkyTPRxXkZQ==","fsize":496913,"resto":117664836,"id":"L6uwGYcX","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":117665243,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)16:21:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117665166\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117665166<\/a><br><br>Probably because of Brexit!","time":1490127705,"resto":117664836,"id":"+qctUIN3","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":117665285,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)16:22:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117664836\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117664836<\/a><br>SOME TALK OF ALEXANDER SOME OF HERCULES","time":1490127723,"resto":117664836,"id":"MphWKq+i","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":117665297,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)16:22:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"Look what you&#039;ve done.

Cheers again for sharing it.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Though UK mortgage banks are pretty crummy, they are not complete fools. They do not allow mug investors to gamble with the bank\u2019s depositors\u2019 money without at least taking some steps to ensure that it is not all lost. Whilst the buy to let mortgage contracts are called mortgages they walk and talk like business loans and, under certain conditions, behave as faintly exotic instruments for financing gambling, which is of course what they really are, (I prefer to call them ersatz mortgages) Buy-to-let mortgage contracts, again to the best of my knowledge, often, possibly usually or even always, contain clauses that give the lender the ability to call in the loan once a downward movement in house price extinguishes the borrower\u2019s equity. A single example will suffice by way of explanation. Suppose you invest \u00a350,000 in property, borrowing \u00a3150,000 from a friendly bank and purchasing a rather underwhelming new build flat for \u00a3200,000. You have a mortgage with a loan-to-value 75%.House prices now fall by 25%. The bank looks at the Land Registry data for your area and establishes that you now have a house which is worth \u00a3150,000 and you owe them \u00a3150,000, so they write you a letter asking for their money back, because you now have a 100% loan to value, and that is not the basis on which they lent you the money.You could sell the house and pay them back (you will have therefore lost \u00a350,000) or you could arrange a new mortgage. A lender will be willing to offer you 75% of what your buy-to-let investment property is now worth, a loan of \u00a3112,500, so to stay at the table you will need to find another \u00a337,500 from your savings so that with the new loan,and this new cash from you,the \u00a3150,000 owing to your original lender can be repaid.At this point you would have handed over \u00a387,500 to the banks to chase your buy-to-let dream; buy-to-let investors have always been the mark, and not the card sharp.<\/span><br><br>Karmic.","time":1490128319,"resto":117664836,"id":"06fV\/7jh","country":"GB","trip":"!!80w9cz1G8ZX","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":117666508,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)16:32:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"BROKEN BREXIT","filename":"frog (444)","ext":".png","w":303,"h":566,"tn_w":66,"tn_h":124,"tim":1490128341819,"time":1490128341,"md5":"ccZZx4lkIdb3MoEntFaEQQ==","fsize":167088,"resto":117664836,"id":"WDSzi1ms","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":117666549,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)16:32:44","name":"Rightly So","com":"<a href=\"#p117666307\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117666307<\/a><br>&quot;I thought Christmas only came once a year&quot;<br><br>Brosnan was the last person who played Bond, all the films after Die Another Day are just trying to be too serious.","time":1490128364,"resto":117664836,"id":"9ls2q3gL","country":"GB","trip":"!!sD6h8LgcbfU","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":117666555,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)16:32:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117665839\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117665839<\/a><br><br>get enough votes not to lose your entry deposit<br><br>like \u00a3300 innit?<br><br>what are you running as?

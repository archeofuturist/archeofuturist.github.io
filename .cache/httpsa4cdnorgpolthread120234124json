The islands are like the moments in your life when faith seems like fixed certainty, terra firma, when there is little doubt in your mind of the truth of God&#039;s existence. Unfortunately, the space between, the sea, is racked with doubts, and makes up the majority of your voyage.

Really interesting stuff. Basically it explains that there are two major types of breeding patterns. &quot;r&quot; selected breeding patterns in animals (or humans) emphasizes massive numbers of offspring with little hopes of them surviving, with little parental care of there young. Rabbits, flies, and other rapid breeders are good examples. <br><br>&quot;K&quot; selected animals emphasize significant parental oversight and nurturing and very low birthrates, as well as pair bonding between mates sometimes lasting lifetimes. Mostly seen in apex predators and very long lived animals where they live at carrying capacity in their environment.

The original sin is inability to possess sanctifying grace - the grace by which creatures can get to Heaven. It&#039;s pretty easy to get rid of this - the usual way is by baptism by water, although baptism of desire (desire of baptism combined with perfect love of God - a person who unexpectedly dies in such a state experiences the same effect as the one produced if they were actually baptised) suffices too, as does martyrdom. Notice that there is no right to sanctifying grace, it isn&#039;t inherent in nature of any creature. God by His own will gives it. This is the first reason why He is our saviour. You still have to deal with the other two, and there is no ordinary means to get rid of them. Of particualr interest to your question is concupiscence - before the Fall, the senses were completely submitted to reason. After the Fall, this condition was lost and now we have to struggle against sinful desires, which, even though we know they are wrong, are still tempting us. As is widely known from experience, we are tremendously bad at this - the worst that can happen to our soul, and indeed often happens, is mortal sin. Several sins - like murder, theft or lust - when committed with knowledge of their evil and with full consent - &quot;lock&quot; our souls on something which we identify as good, but which isn&#039;t God. When we live, this orientation of the soul can be changed, but not after death. Then, the soul is permanently set upon evil and as consequence is continuously and eternally punished. During life such a soul can&#039;t change its state by its own effort - for that, God Himself must intervene. Although it would still be just of Him to abandon this person, as the state they have put themselves into is their own, conscious choice, He neverthless prefers to have mercy on mortal sinners, giving them grace they need to reform themselves.","time":1492795492,"resto":122149878,"id":"KdlUoNY5","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"}]}

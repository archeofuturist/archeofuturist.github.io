Every fundamental christian doctrine encourages some sort of cuckoldry, weakness, and submission.

Only now the traditional aspects of Christianity have been shed off in modern society and only the degenerate<br>ideals remain. And all these autistic \/pol\/acks act like if they pretend to believe in Jesus and cling to Christian traditionalism that theyll find a nondegenerate wife and everything will go back to being medieval Europe. No, christianity fundamentally brings about degeneracy. Theres a reason priests fuck kids and catholic schoolgirls are the biggest sluts on the planet, because it encourages backwards thinking. Traditionalism can exist without christianity. Europeans were traditional before they were Christian. And that doesn&#039;t mean we need to LARP as pagans either. That religion is gone and any neopagan religion is also degenerate. We need family values, we need God, we need folkish traditions (which are still celebrated today like christmas and easter although theyve been commercialized), but we do not need any universalist pacifist unscientific dogma. We should go back to having multiple schools of thought like there was in ancient greece where people can debate the truth using reasoning and still adhere to the same European traditional Western values which were present before the arrival of Christianity.<br><br>tl,dr: fuck off","time":1492528529,"resto":121678273,"id":"3dsW+19L","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121694934,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)11:16:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121693582\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121693582<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;they have a lot in common, but they are not catholics<\/span><br><br>Now I know you&#039;re LARPing because you&#039;re clueless.","time":1492528581,"resto":121678273,"id":"FE\/bSOes","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121695219,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)11:18:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121678273\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121678273<\/a><br>Because Christianity has little to do with the Bible, it&#039;s a business and has always been.","time":1492528735,"resto":121678273,"id":"f58A4pcM","country":"CH","country_name":"Switzerland"},{"no":121695350,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)11:20:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121678273\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121678273<\/a><br>They used to in the UK. <br><br>Women used to always wear hats in Church even in the 90s.","time":1492528805,"resto":121678273,"id":"x9oOrd4e","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121695358,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)11:20:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121678273\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121678273<\/a><br>I see gals at my church wearing veils all the time.","time":1492528810,"resto":121678273,"id":"oNGywEcp","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121695384,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)11:20:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121695219\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121695219<\/a><br><br>What came first, Christanity or the bible?","time":1492528823,"resto":121678273,"id":"FE\/bSOes","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121695629,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)11:22:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121681864\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121681864<\/a><br>\/thread","time":1492528949,"resto":121678273,"id":"\/AJ4i\/Z\/","country":"AT","country_name":"Austria"},{"no":121695769,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)11:23:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121695219\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121695219<\/a><br>Oi weh!

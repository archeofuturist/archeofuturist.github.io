One presupposes minarchic monopolistic governance whilst one presupposes polycentric governance.<br><br>(II): Both philosophies endorse disallowance (not mere &#039;regulation&#039;) of violating private property. Thus --- in libertarianism --- when pollution is violating someones&#039; property or person, a legal case is brought against whatever organization is polluting and a governmental court exacts propitious restitution for all parties harmed. This is better than bureaucratic regulation which often forbids innocuous activities whilst excepting polluters from paying full restitution. The process is identical in anarcho-capitalism except courts and enforcers are private and polycentric. <br><br>(III): In Techno-Commercialism, a sovereign company governs a micro-state and prevents private courts and enforcers from engaging in Hobbesian warfare whilst providing a sovereign court of final appeal.","filename":"1490157908057","ext":".png","w":853,"h":1025,"tn_w":104,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491712942678,"time":1491712942,"md5":"\/R38vGipZQF4ujBVs1JFUA==","fsize":137520,"resto":120235595,"id":"NTHvPqTZ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120239108,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)00:44:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"Why do you think the state would be a good solution to pollution? <br><br>Seems to me like the countries with the history of the most controlling governments are also the most polluted ones.","time":1491713092,"resto":120235595,"id":"sZOtWZz6","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120239174,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)00:45:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120238495\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120238495<\/a><br><br>Which is predictable because communal ownership incentivizes a higher time preference than private ownership (hence why communal governance (democracy) is worse than private governance (monarchy)).","time":1491713125,"resto":120235595,"id":"NTHvPqTZ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120239320,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)00:46:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120238817\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120238817<\/a><br>based","filename":"ancapwaifu","ext":".png","w":750,"h":1020,"tn_w":91,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491713201084,"time":1491713201,"md5":"R7cX3VPnWCNuUZcozm\/Cgg==","fsize":470908,"resto":120235595,"id":"M9rlmjbX","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120239371,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)00:47:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120235595\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120235595<\/a><br><br>Global warming is a Chinese hoax.","time":1491713226,"resto":120235595,"id":"S9B+B9bd","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120239375,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)00:47:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120235595\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120235595<\/a><br>Instead of limiting ourselves, we adapt.

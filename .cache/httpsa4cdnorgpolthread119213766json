Well, it turns out he was right as we found out after declassification of the Venona Project. Nash was a skilled cryptologist \/ code breaker, early member of the NSA, and helped uncover this stuff that he was called &quot;crazy&quot; for talking about.<br><br>You can see from these two things that the &quot;deep state&quot; isn&#039;t just about the CIA but is more like a transnational complex that has fake \/ orchestrated conflicts between nations.

He was the lawyer for McCarthy and managed to redirect investigation of the stuff that people like John Nash were talking about (hard evidence of literally thousands of agents embedded in the government that were not loyal to the USA) to some sort of silly witch hunt against &quot;communists&quot; and &quot;homosexuals.&quot;<br><br>Roger Stone was mentored by Cohn and is doing something very similar today.

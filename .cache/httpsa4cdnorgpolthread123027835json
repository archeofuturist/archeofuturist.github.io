Written in 1883, her celebrated poem, &quot;The New Colossus,&quot; is engraved on a plaque in the pedestal of the Statue of Liberty.

In her later years, she wrote bold, powerful poetry and essays protesting the rise of antisemitism and arguing for Russian immigrants&#039; rights. She called on Jews to unite and create a homeland in Palestine before the title Zionist had even been coined.<\/span><br><br>Brave woman.","time":1493294936,"resto":123027835,"id":"C8xRM5T5","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":123029329,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)08:11:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123028962\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123028962<\/a><br>Noses get the nooses","time":1493295082,"resto":123027835,"id":"c8CA9aAX","country":"MX","country_name":"Mexico"},{"no":123029731,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)08:15:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123027835\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123027835<\/a><br>why put such a stupid picture when everybody here knows how ((free)) leafland is?","filename":"tmp_32641-14906796253051443582151","ext":".jpg","w":517,"h":650,"tn_w":99,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493295346741,"time":1493295346,"md5":"YHVAbxH+CULri8K\/kjnDpA==","fsize":79689,"resto":123027835,"id":"r4xT275T","country":"RO","country_name":"Romania"},{"no":123029891,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)08:17:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123027835\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123027835<\/a><br>The poem forgets the &quot;physically, mentally, and ideologically screen every single one and if they&#039;re defective, ship their asses back to the shithole they came from&quot; part.","time":1493295465,"resto":123027835,"id":"755KyxfI","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123030100,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)08:19:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123027835\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123027835<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Give me your tired, your poor<\/span><br>rapefugees arent too tired they cant assault people<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free<\/span><br>they dont want to be free they just want to share the chains of their cult","time":1493295595,"resto":123027835,"id":"adIA30pv","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123030106,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)08:19:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123029731\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123029731<\/a><br>free from rural and suburban retards","time":1493295597,"resto":123027835,"id":"rjoWNlPr","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123030166,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)08:20:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123027835\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123027835<\/a><br>Wasn&#039;t that poem written by a Jew","time":1493295648,"resto":123027835,"id":"sel9k6i7","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123030819,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)08:28:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123028906\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123028906<\/a><br>kek","time":1493296103,"resto":123027835,"id":"atWDxfRx","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"}]}

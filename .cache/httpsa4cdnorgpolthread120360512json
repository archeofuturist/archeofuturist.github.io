After Saddam denied he had such weapons why would he use them or leave them readily available to be found? That would only legitimize President Bush, whom he has a personal grudge against.

One of such cache, which was identified by Vasili Mitrokhin, exploded when Swiss authorities tried to remove it from woods near Bern. Several others caches were removed successfully.<br><br>Lunev asserted that some of the hidden caches could contain portable tactical nuclear weapons known as RA-115 &quot;suitcase bombs&quot;. Such bombs have been prepared to assassinate US leaders in the event of war, according to him.[6] Lunev states that he had personally looked for hiding places for weapons caches in the Shenandoah Valley area[1] and that &quot;it is surprisingly easy to smuggle nuclear weapons into the US, either across the Mexican border or using a small transport missile that can slip undetected when launched from a Russian airplane.","time":1491796594,"resto":120360512,"id":"zBRszxG5","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120388682,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)23:56:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120388647\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120388647<\/a><br>According to Lunev, a probable scenario in the event of war would have been poisoning the Potomac River with chemical or biological weapons, &quot;targeting the residents of Washington, D.C.&quot;[1] He also considered it &quot;likely&quot; that GRU operatives placed &quot;poison supplies near the tributaries to major US reservoirs.&quot;[9] These allegations have been confirmed by former SVR officer Kouzminov [10] who was responsible for transporting pathogens from around the world for Russian program of biological weapons in the 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s.

Subsequently, they made a clumsy attempt to discredit the archive, by sending two apparent &quot;defectors&quot; to Western intelligence agencies who claimed that the KGB&#039;s successor, the SVR, had decided on a massive clear-out of superannuated agents and had chosen Mitrokhin to transmit their details to the West. By that time, though, it had become clear that Mitrokhin&#039;s material was far too valuable for the SVR to have handed it over willingly, and the &quot;defectors&quot; were soon exposed as Russian plants<br><br>Mitrokhin archive led to resignations, arrests and a few prosecutions around the world","time":1491798207,"resto":120360512,"id":"zBRszxG5","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120391647,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)00:23:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120360603\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120360603<\/a><br>learn to crosspost, newfag<br><a href=\"\/wsg\/thread\/1627157#p1630981\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;&gt;\/wsg\/1630981<\/a><br>took me a while to find<br><br>otherwise, good post","time":1491798219,"resto":120360512,"id":"2FEdON8l","country":"AR","country_name":"Argentina"},{"no":120392901,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)00:35:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120391626\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120391626<\/a><br>http:\/\/www.dailymail.co.uk\/news\/art<wbr>icle-2682825\/Booby-trapped-arms-cac<wbr>hes-hidden-Britain-Soviet-agents-pl<wbr>aced-weapons-Europe-Cold-War-KGBs-M<wbr>itrokhin-files-reveal.html<br><br>Files compiled by KGB Major Vasili Mitrokhin, who moved to UK in 1992<br>His archive - revealed today - details several weapons dumps across Europe<br><br>Booby-trapped Soviet weapon caches which date back to the Cold War are probably still buried across Britain, a top historian has claimed.<br>Professor Christopher Andrew, an expert on the history of the intelligence services, made the claim after a secret archive released today revealed the location of several arms dumps across Europe.<br><br>Their existence is detailed in the Mitrokhin Archive, a collection of thousands of Soviet intelligence documents compiled by a defector and made public for the first time today.<br><br>A map included in the archive pinpointed three sites, named Kollo, Fosso and Bor, around Rome.<br>And another note provided instructions on how to disarm an explosive booby trap called Molniya or Lightning<br><br>Some of the caches have since been uncovered, but many are likely to remain today, said Prof Andrew, a friend of Mitrokhin who has written two books about his vast trove of documents.<br><br>This was a large scale operation and the caches were strategically placed in most Nato countries during the Cold War,&#039; he said.<br><br>-<br>Sharing these to show previous soviet behavior hiding weapons stashed around the globe, files proved authentic when coordinates turned up hidden weapons.

There&#039;s a bunch of me who want to but aren&#039;t able to (betas and ugly fags). But then there&#039;s a bunch of men who are attractive who don&#039;t see the point in taking on their civic duty so they indulge in their impulses. Whether that be video games or womanizing or whatever. <br><br>I am 30 years old and I haven&#039;t fathered children or performed my civic duty, I am one of those white males who should by all means start a family. The only women I can find that are suitable to start a family with though are Asian girls and I don&#039;t want a higher chance of having a short ugly son so it really kind of sucks.","time":1490377518,"resto":118105742,"id":"H8gbDwL5","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118106164,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)13:46:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118106008\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118106008<\/a><br><br>No it&#039;s not that. If we were strong and handsome enough we&#039;d keep society in order. Societies failings are our failings. We&#039;re not 100% to blame because women are chaos and we haven&#039;t managed them properly. We need to manage the chaos of women and the chaos of society better. But we ourselves have let too much chaos into our own lives through procrastination and not working hard enough.","time":1490377601,"resto":118105742,"id":"H8gbDwL5","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118106220,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)13:47:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"too much guilt and burden with very little reward for efforts","filename":"1487817636688","ext":".png","w":800,"h":900,"tn_w":111,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490377637560,"time":1490377637,"md5":"t4IIpTByjP3OQk26LDY\/1Q==","fsize":661085,"resto":118105742,"id":"JGGrkb0Z","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":118107031,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)13:54:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"Because instead of making the right choice to keep on living as men even under persecution by society, they whine and complain and try to get sympathy and attention for their woes, which leads to anime and video game and porn addiction.","time":1490378089,"resto":118105742,"id":"Ea\/ZZDsx","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118107355,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)13:57:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"Society offers nothing in return for my efforts.","time":1490378262,"resto":118105742,"id":"oqPpGm1x","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"}]}

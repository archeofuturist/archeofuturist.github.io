Death is a wrong word since nobody knows anything about. People use to describe absence of life, but they also haven&#039;t defined what is life or at least defined it to suit their interests. Cult is just another word that changes according to time, place, vantage point, perspective, etc. Modern day israel and social order called &quot;judaism&quot; has nothing to do with jews or judaism. Star of david is not jewish symbol. It&#039;s about 100-150 years old. Not a single jew lives in that place. It&#039;s just CIA military base. Zionism is military template being rinsed and repeated by using the same borats but following another &quot;faith&quot; of circumciser.","time":1493546127,"resto":123460797,"id":"jBBrwa+E","country":"LT","country_name":"Lithuania"}]}

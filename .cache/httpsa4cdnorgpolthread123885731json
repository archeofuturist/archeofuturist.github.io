What this means is that you can frequent them as much as you like as either a user or an observer. I recommend at least spending an hour or two on each site, as that\u2019s all you\u2019ll need to see how devastatingly pathetic the entire enterprise is.<br>I use the word \u201cpathetic\u201d advisedly here\u2014these are really sad places, full of really sad people, and you\u2019ll need to parcel out your time there carefully.<br>Keep in mind that most alt-right trolls are males under the age of 25, so what you\u2019re seeing is a motley reenactment of what would\u2019ve been the most achingly awkward fraternity at whatever college or university you attended. All of these sites are a compendium of stupid in-jokes, viral memes, multimedia from \u201cnerd culture\u201d\u2014a shame, given how awesome that subculture is\u2014and a persistent exploration of what young men can get away with online when they have the opportunity to act anonymously. So: you\u2019ll see a lot of posts (and some images) that are misogynistic, homophobic, racist, anti-Semitic, and so on. The posters posting this content are in a few cases actually committed misogynists, homophobes, racists, and anti-Semites; much more commonly, they\u2019re relatively unsophisticated \u201ckids\u201d\u2014using that term here to denote emotional immaturity rather than chronological age\u2014who are exploring complicated anxieties, angers, and associations they don\u2019t really know how to process yet in any way but the anti-social.","time":1493798901,"resto":123885731,"id":"GKEHHWsI","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123889501,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)04:08:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123889178\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123889178<\/a><br>doesn&#039;t help that they are indistinguishable from actual genuine lefties","time":1493798909,"resto":123885731,"id":"Rj1+W+J3","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123889502,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)04:08:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"PRESIDENT TRUMP !

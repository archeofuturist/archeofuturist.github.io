Yes Celsius works well for science. Celsius is poorly calculated by trying to measure a freezing temperature, and until recently was fairly inaccurate +\/- 1 C. However Fahrenheit is based off a Frigorific mixture, which makes a stable reference. Furthermore, in every day use Fahrenheit is better for getting a more accurate idea of the temperature and range for weather. 0 F is very cold, and 100 F is very hot.

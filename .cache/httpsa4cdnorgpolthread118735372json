Then read Trump&#039;s. Which reads like carefully manufactured PR, and which reads like straight-shot no bullshit? It&#039;s like this for every single fucking issue.<br><br>I&#039;m not saying Hillary&#039;s fake, I&#039;m saying she sounds like it. Lack of charisma was a big issue for her. I&#039;m fucking smart enough to not judge someone by how they talk. I look at what they&#039;re saying and how carefully they&#039;re thinking of answering the question. Because at that level of power, when you are competing at the level of people who are exactly like you, fought through their own elections and rose up in their own countries, what you say and how you say it can matter a lot. An enormous number of livelihoods depend on what these people say. People fucking die.<br><br>This doesn&#039;t matter though. It&#039;s frankly extremely hard in this culture to get people to have empathy for the masses. <br><br>The Washington Post probably didn&#039;t mean to do this, but next to Hillary&#039;s carefully constructed spiel, Trump&#039;s words seem like a hot knife through butter, not giving a shit -- *intentionally* not giving a shit -- about pretenses and just being real talk.<br><br>We all have those moments with friends. &quot;Yo real talk though. This some bullshit.&quot; To Trump supporters, this is what he sounds like. It&#039;s refreshing. It&#039;s clear. It&#039;s easy. This is where the phrase &quot;take him seriously, not literally&quot; comes from.","filename":"Screen Shot 2017-03-28 at 9.30.34 PM","ext":".png","w":1574,"h":1378,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":218,"tim":1490754918153,"time":1490754918,"md5":"hfHb5PNBGTbGBqBvjirr6Q==","fsize":329414,"resto":0,"id":"l7x8cir6","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"why-trump-supporters-will-never-care-about-russia","country_name":"United States","replies":6,"images":0,"unique_ips":4},{"no":118735461,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)22:36:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118735372\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118735372<\/a><br><br>Honestly, I do agree with some of Trump&#039;s stances myself for this very reason. Take his issues on immigration. He says &quot;Yes&quot; to the question &quot;Do you want to deport all 11 million undocumented immigrants?&quot; Now, this question is kind of unfair. I mean, &quot;undocumented immigrants&quot; really makes clear that it&#039;s against the law. When you hear someone say &quot;no&quot; to this question, there is a flag in your brain that immediately says &quot;wait, but the question said they were illegal, which is against the law... wat?&quot;<br><br>On the other hand, when someone says &quot;yes,&quot; the opposite happens. It *sounds* like the right answer to that questions.<br><br>Go down the rest of that list and Trump&#039;s response is the easy, primal response each time.<br>Wall? Fuck it, yes, it&#039;s some kind of barrier. Clear path to citizenship? What? Clear path? That doesn&#039;t seem totally right, if they&#039;re illegal. They&#039;re against the law, they shouldn&#039;t be the same as me. Muslim restrictions? I mean, I&#039;m white and live in the Midwest so I haven&#039;t been around a lot of cultures... Yeah I mean, the Middle East is mostly Muslim and the terrorists were from there, so I mean come on, you can&#039;t just say there&#039;s no connection at all, that&#039;s just PC bullshit. Real talk, there&#039;s no way that&#039;s a coincidence.<br><br>What&#039;s the theme here? Trump&#039;s responses are easy. They&#039;re instinctive. He&#039;s not apologetic about voicing something that is present in the back of most peoples minds. <br><br>And when you start supporting someone who does this, you become a fan. You like listening to what he says, you like watching him say ridiculous bullshit on national TV. And everyone takes it soo seriously, when you know him better -- you know what he&#039;s really doing. He&#039;s milking it, spinning these liberals into a mad frenzy like chickens with their heads cut off. And it&#039;s goddamn hilarious.","time":1490754962,"resto":118735372,"id":"l7x8cir6","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118735499,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)22:36:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118735461\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118735461<\/a><br><br>So it doesn&#039;t matter if they don&#039;t agree with all of Trump&#039;s stances. Most people have one or two issues they really agree with him on (or like what he says about it), and don&#039;t really care about what his stances on the other issues are as much. Let&#039;s say I really, really like his stance on guns. Again, I live in the Midwest so the whole LBGT thing sounds like a coastal bullshit. So I don&#039;t really care about happens to them, because again, it&#039;s hard to have empathy in this culture. So I don&#039;t really care all that much whatever happens to them... because muh guns...<br><br>This is why Trump supporters don&#039;t give a fucking shit about whatever the hell Trump has going on with Russia. They don&#039;t fucking care whoever he appoints for what or whatever the hell, just WHATEVER!!!<br><br>As long as he does the things he said he was going to do, Trump supporters don&#039;t care about any of these &quot;politics as usual&quot; &quot;manufactured&quot; drama and shit. So what if he actually is in bed with the Russians? Why does it matter who he selects for positions? If he does what he said he was going to do, why should I care about these things? I got what I wanted. Easy. Hook, line, sinker.<br><br>This is why none of these scandals matter to Trump supporters. They think it&#039;s all bullshit. Even if (hypothetically) Trump ends up being some really shallow bitch who just wanted to flex his dick and get attention and didn&#039;t actually care about any of these issues, Trump supporters would still support him IF he did what he said he was going to do.","time":1490754981,"resto":118735372,"id":"l7x8cir6","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118735538,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)22:36:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118735499\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118735499<\/a><br><br>It&#039;s a classic cult of personality but with a ticking time bomb. The only reason Trump still has supporters is because they think he will still do the things he said he was going to do. Once he starts failing to deliver on a bunch of shit (I believe he still has a bunch of shit to fail at), he will lose supporters like a fucking hot potato I guarantee you that.<br><br>The ONLY way to change Trump supporters to not support him is to continuously, factually, rub it in their faces about stuff he has failed to deliver on. So far, not that much, because not that much has happened. The Executive Order on immigration was actually a boon for Trumpers. They saw it as starting with a bang, validating their previous support for him and reinforcing his image as a no-bullshiter.<br><br>Pointing out nefarious connections and signs of manipulation and criminal activity won&#039;t do anything to change a Trumper&#039;s mind, because to them, that&#039;s all politics bullshit. Show them results. Show them winning. They want to win. It&#039;s simple. It&#039;s better. It&#039;s stronger. More animalistic. Primal. They want to feel like they&#039;re winning!<br><br>To change Trump supporters&#039; minds, you have to show them they are fucking losing lmao LOSING. SO BADLY. Maybe then they will realize that Trump is no different and they all just got fucking played.

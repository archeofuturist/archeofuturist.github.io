Republicans did fix it already. This was already a thing a few years ago. 50yrs dem ruled Flynt had the crisis looming, help is help us, so a board, comprised entirely of republicans and operating outside the local govt, figured out the steps needed to solve the problem and started their implementation. Everything was great. Then their job was done and they left the situation in control of the dem govt. Fast forward to now. Help help we fucked it up again.

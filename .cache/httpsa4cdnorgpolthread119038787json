Conservatist right wingers win again. <br><br>And we are creating more and more jobs to replace everything that gets automated, so the way things are we are resistant to automation, not that the replicators were infinite energy, a tractor needs maintenance and fuel you know. Not everyone needs to fix the machine that does the work of thousands, but if they did, would we be working for anything material? No, we&#039;d be doing it for the sake of progress because the infinite energy that the trek has, and the automation, just forces the jobs to be pure intellectual shit. Nothing left to do but run around in nothingness at that point, so they do, in space. <br><br>Also, we COULD stop using our tax money on prisons and making moar shit illegal, and going to war war war, and instead put it all into making a big ol&#039; thermal reactor in the earth, to solve our problems, but nu impossible to change.<br><br>The only thing wrong with trek is our need for drama, people shouldn&#039;t work at all if there&#039;s no money because of automation, but they do anyway. Get into wars with other nation, all the while trying not to interfere ironically, to resist the the inherent tyrannical nature of being far left or right, despite being lefts they try not to interfere, and yet go to war with those of whom would. Who gives them the right to nudge everyone into their direction? Subtle, ironic, tyranny. Prime directive means not much.<br><br>It&#039;s an ironic show for it&#039;s motives, not it&#039;s impossible tech. And reminder that lefts have higher IQs.","filename":"download","ext":".jpg","w":233,"h":216,"tn_w":233,"tn_h":216,"tim":1490950875225,"time":1490950875,"md5":"2Ug755cc6N5ZZEK3tdvMbg==","fsize":6528,"resto":0,"id":"VyXCxMWo","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"board-too-fast-killed-in-ten-minutes","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":1},{"no":119040929,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)05:41:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"Atlantis tier is unironic left motive.

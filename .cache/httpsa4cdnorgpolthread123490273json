You could power the entire US electricity grid off of the energy in nuclear waste for almost 100 years (details). If you recycle the waste, the final waste that is left over decays to harmlessness within a few hundred years, rather than a million years as with standard (unrecycled) nuclear waste.<\/span>","filename":"what_hasnt_science_done","ext":".jpg","w":619,"h":470,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":94,"tim":1493570433310,"time":1493570433,"md5":"EzrggZF1ABrhwA4aqaP7dQ==","fsize":40008,"resto":123490273,"id":"m8evVgbK","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":123495623,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)12:40:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123495348\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123495348<\/a><br>That too, and yet retards continue to say that hydropower reduces carbon emissions.","time":1493570440,"resto":123490273,"id":"hh62YXMZ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123495689,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)12:41:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123490273\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123490273<\/a><br>massive cost that if it pays off will take decades to match initial investment<br><br>nuclear reactor could turn my town into the next chernobyl<br><br>Our ancestors going back tens of thousands of years have eaten meat and survived to reproduce, meaning it has been a part of if not essential to the human diet for that long and the notion you can change that within a few generations is absurd<br><br>we have plenty of oil reserves in the west as is, leftists just don&#039;t want to tap into them because they create jobs which takes away potential welfare cows<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;look cool<\/span><br><br>not an argument","time":1493570480,"resto":123490273,"id":"DOCY0d0p","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123495735,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)12:41:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"Should start building thorium reactors.","time":1493570508,"resto":123490273,"id":"lZBYa3gn","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123495760,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)12:42:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123494868\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123494868<\/a><br>That&#039;s great, but how can we eat fish if they&#039;re all dead?","time":1493570521,"resto":123490273,"id":"hh62YXMZ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123495803,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)12:42:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123490273\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123490273<\/a><br>Going green isn&#039;t the issue. <br><br><a href=\"#p123491077\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123491077<\/a><br>this is the issue","time":1493570545,"resto":123490273,"id":"+NOR\/W4m","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123495833,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)12:42:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123495269\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123495269<\/a><br>And you Canadians have CANDU reactors, which are pretty fuckin&#039; clever<br><br>To support your points:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Waste management<\/span><br><br>If the West adopted a strong policy of reprocessing waste, this issue would be minimized greatly.

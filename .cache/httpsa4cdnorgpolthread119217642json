It seems as if the whole western culture is built around the Greek Ideals. These ideals have then made their way into Christianity via Augustine and neo-platonists. Technically, our whole culture, morality, and sense of justice is based around the roman ideals, be it either platonic or aristotelian. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; well no shit, anon, thanks for the wisdom nugget. <\/span><br><br>This is not all. If you notice, all of Greek philosophy is, in essence, very authoritarian or totalitarian. For example, Platon was an aristocrat (theoretically) who believed that the plebians need to hear a noble lie when the Philosopher kings rule over society to make sure it is a virtuous one, and everyone lives happily. <br><br>According to Aristotle people were better depending on how good\/successful they were at reaching their purpose, which implies that there was a purpose, to begin with.

The Age of Enlightenment dealt with the demystification of society that was held under an autocratic mode of production namely Feudalism, and challenged the authority of Monarchs. People like Newton believed humans had natural rights that had to be ensured and protected by civil government. The shift towards materialist philosophy by thinkers like Marx came nearly a hundred years after the Enlightenment from thinkers like Feuerbach and Hegel. Marx&#039;s philosophy was a direct response to the material conditions of society at that time, largely the working class divides in the industrial era, and the inability for capitalism to have developed a sufficient lifestyle for the majority of people.<br><br>Read a fucking book.","time":1491153962,"resto":119217642,"id":"Q0yRFrgI","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119221683,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)13:30:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119221234\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119221234<\/a><br>You did not understand my point.

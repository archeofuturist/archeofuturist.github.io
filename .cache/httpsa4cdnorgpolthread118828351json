Depending on how these leaks were obtained, the person(s) who did the leaking may have to answer for a crime, but no one has been caught so it&#039;s beside the point for the time being. The question is what was in those emails. <br>On the other hand, you have a really blurry picture that is slowly coming into focus about Trump being spied on by multiple federal agencies, and that members of the Obama administration were complicit, had knowledge and have been leaking any info obtained to the press. So far nothing of &quot;smoking gun&quot; value has been obtained about Trump or his administration, thus it&#039;s easy to ignore any small crumbs that have been shared. Recognizing that there isn&#039;t much there we shift focus to &#039;who ordered the spying on a presidential candidate&#039; and why are high levels of the executive branch leaking classified information to the press. <br><br>So, to sum up why these are two entirely different situations:<br>The leaked info on Hillary and the DNC shows vast corruption. <br>The leaked info on Trump shows nothing of substance at all (and this has generally been confirmed by a number of Obama administration individuals, along with a number of current sitting bureaucrats). <br>The leaked SOURCE material on Hillary is the DNC&#039;s own e-mail servers (how it was obtained might be a crime but we don&#039;t know who did it).<br>The leaked SOURCE material on Trump is from the federal government spying on individuals within Trump&#039;s team during an election campaign. We also know that the leakers are individuals from the Obama administration.<br><br>That&#039;s why they&#039;re different and why Trump being spied on by our government is so different than Hillary&#039;s leaked emails.","time":1490823001,"resto":118828351,"id":"f\/23BW2\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118836979,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)17:30:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118828351\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118828351<\/a><br>She looks like a spooligan all grown up<br><br>Obama got fartly fooliganed","time":1490823011,"resto":118828351,"id":"mM2pikCN","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118837156,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)17:31:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118828351\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118828351<\/a><br>What the fuck is up with its eyes?

I was thinking of some of the ideologies that were going around at the time the song came out. If he did want to write a song making fun of them, I don&#039;t think he would have written a blunt song against them because a lot of his fans were lefties and hippies and he probably wouldn&#039;t want to piss them off that much. I don&#039;t think he&#039;s a right winger exactly but he doesn&#039;t strike me as someone who would be a lefty loony. He&#039;s certainly not \/ourguy\/, if you want to put it that way, but I could see him making fun of some of the stuff that comes out of the left. He&#039;s also a smart guy who is known for putting deeper meanings into his lyrics. I&#039;m just hammering my interpretation out now. See what you think.<br><br>&quot;Happy and I&#039;m smiling,<br>Walking miles to drink your water.<br>You know I&#039;d love to love you,<br>And above you there&#039;s no other.&quot;&quot;<br>I reckon this could be a dig at socialism and communism. Propaganda often portrayed the workers as happy and smiling, even though in reality they were very poor and often starving. &quot;Walking miles to drink your water&quot; could perhaps be a sort of absurd illustration of the difficulties concerning logistics and resource management in a socialist society, and also maybe invokes the droughts that have been made needlessly catastrophic because of this or the forced migrations that these societies are known for. I mean if you were walking miles to drink water would you be happy and smiling? Obviously if that is what it means then it&#039;s been exaggerated for effect. Also, if everyone is meant to be equal then &quot;above you there&#039;s no other&quot; is a fitting line. This bit could also have another meaning which is that the &#039;you&#039; referred to could also refer to the state itself, for example, there&#039;s nothing above the state in a totalitarian society and even the water belongs to the state.<br><br>I&#039;m doing the rest of it now.

To me and every rational person this would be nonsensical. So, obviously exams were being tailored for better results. Different examining boards showed that some boards were harder to pass (JMB vs AEB,) and thickos got to sit CSE exams and were told that grade 1 was the equivalent to an &#039;O&#039; level, which it clearly wasn&#039;t or why wouldn&#039;t the teacher let them sit the &#039;O&#039; level? Because the teacher knew that they would fail, but had a chance to pass the CSE. <br>From my own experiences (I was sent by the NCB to technical college and then university) I would say less than 10% of any subject taught is useful in a working environment, or suited to a specific job. The sum is always a combination of things that are mainly irrelevant. An example being a geologist learning about volcanoes and then getting a job in oil. I have an old friend who is a senior partner at a top 4 law firm in HK and she said the same. Many of my other friends with degrees say the same, or they work in a job which has nothing to do with the degree, a manager with a degree in Ancient History as an example. <br>Let me know if you want me to continue<br>I find it easy to compare the decline because I have seen it with my own eyes, and I have a HK friend here who makes money from it.","time":1491897194,"resto":120537731,"id":"TJWhMAvW","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120571436,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)03:54:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;tfw fell for the credit jew<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;tfw irresponsible and impulsive spending<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u00a315k jew debt at the age of 27 with nothing to show for it<\/span><br><br>How do I develop self control?","time":1491897289,"resto":120537731,"id":"648XmR12","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120571685,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)03:58:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120569350\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120569350<\/a><br>I agree.

Just don&#039;t do it. If you don&#039;t spend the money you&#039;ll have some spare for when you actually need it, and you will need it at some point. Besides, even if you weren&#039;t spending money that you don&#039;t have, saving up all year just to blow everything you had saved in a couple of weeks on a holiday that might not even be that great would still be a stupid thing to do. Holidays are really for people who have a decent amount of money. Holidays and frivolous things like that are basically something you do to reward yourself for earning so much money that you couldn&#039;t spend it all on things that you needed. If you haven&#039;t bothered to earn that money, what are you even rewarding yourself for? Simply stop doing it. Get yourself some hobbies that don&#039;t cost so much. This is one of the few things you can&#039;t blame on the Jews. You did it to yourself because you&#039;re a fucking spaz. Just stop being a spaz.

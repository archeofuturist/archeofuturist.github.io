I thanked her and told her that it was mine and she said &quot;The things found on earth are kept by the collector&quot; and walks away... I looked at the cashier who is as amazed as me and, in a loud voice, I say to the lady, &quot;is this some kind of joke?! Give me back my $20!&quot; I followed her into the parking lot of the Piggly Wiggly, still shouting, but she would not stop.... When she got to her car, she put her shopping bags from the Piggly Wiggly on the ground to open her car door of her Sudan. So I ran up, grabbed the bags and ran off yelling &quot;The things found on earth are kept by the collector!!&quot; I went home nervous, shaken and agitated because I&#039;ve never stolen anything in my life.","filename":"Piggly Wiggly","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":181,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":70,"tim":1491264191460,"time":1491264191,"md5":"5e\/dcARTvjGVTeQA8OmBXg==","fsize":46312,"resto":0,"id":"AaKGS0Yc","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"what-is-wrong-with-people","country_name":"United States","replies":179,"images":43,"unique_ips":126,"tail_size":50},{"no":119402031,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)20:05:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119401760\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119401760<\/a><br>Good move if true.

In grocery stores of that time, shoppers presented their orders to clerks who then gathered the goods from the store shelves. Saunders, a dynamic and innovative man, noticed that this method resulted in wasted time and expense, so he came up with an unheard-of solution that would revolutionize the entire grocery industry: he developed a way for shoppers to serve themselves.<\/span><br><br>Origin of the name:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Saunders&#039; reason for choosing the intriguing name \u201cPiggly Wiggly\u00ae\u201d remains a mystery; he was curiously reluctant to explain its origin. One story says that, while riding a train, he looked out his window and saw several little pigs struggling to get under a fence, which prompted him to think of the rhyme. Someone once asked him why he had chosen such an unusual name for his organization, to which he replied, &quot;So people will ask that very question.&quot; Regardless of his inspiration, he succeeded in finding a name that would be talked about and remembered.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Pic related the founder of the Piggly Wiggly<\/span>","filename":"the pig&#039;s big wig","ext":".jpg","w":117,"h":147,"tn_w":99,"tn_h":124,"tim":1491266975974,"time":1491266975,"md5":"XyByk5teVNRsIpzZdtYkLQ==","fsize":6919,"resto":119401760,"id":"1CUzntFY","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119406979,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)20:49:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119401760\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119401760<\/a><br>Was it a nigger?<br><br>Be honest","time":1491266977,"resto":119401760,"id":"H6SLcm8n","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119406994,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)20:49:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119403233\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119403233<\/a><br><br>Who knows?

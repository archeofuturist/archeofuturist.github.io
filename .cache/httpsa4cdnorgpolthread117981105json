Sure, in the past the male labour participation rate was higher, but that doesn&#039;t mean all of these men had families and procreated. Many were probably just lonely sons of bitches who went to work in a factory, or in a coal mine, and never really had enough to offer a woman. Also consider the fact that I am sure there were more men in those days who simply died of starvation on the street, or were just bums their entire lives, also never getting the chance to procreate.<br><br>Seriously, there is nothing new at all. Society, as Jordan Peterson says, is just a collection of hierarchies, and men compete to reach the top of those hierarchies, for access to resources and women. There have always been men who lose at this game, and you are the current losers. There&#039;s nothing new about that.","filename":"peterson meme 4","ext":".png","w":619,"h":602,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":121,"tim":1490303855893,"time":1490303855,"md5":"X09axxqf+c0ubgwoAK56vg==","fsize":119190,"resto":117981105,"id":"jVbJfl1\/","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":117985002,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)17:18:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117983579\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117983579<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;haha just google it xD<\/span><br><br>No. I see this claim posted on this board over and over that men are &quot;opting out&quot;, and the onus is on the people making the claim to provide proof for it.<br><br>Besides, when they provide links, it&#039;s always the same links over and over again - links that I also find very quickly when I google the topic.<br><br><a href=\"#p117984223\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117984223<\/a><br><br>\/pol\/ never shuts the flying fuck up about how women are victims because men are not dating or marrying or getting good enough careers, so therefore that leaves women single and it also leaves women with a visible lack of male presence in public.","time":1490303922,"resto":117981105,"id":"UWxJFosV","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":117985227,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)17:20:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"I&#039;m opting out of society and buying cheap land to build a low cost home on as soon as I&#039;m able and living as cheaply as possible.

You fags didn&#039;t care throughout the election when &quot;shills&quot; told you he was a lying sack of shit conman and now you&#039;re complaining. Fuck everyone that supported Trump throughout 2015-2016. You all contributed to this even though the signs were all there. Stop complaining and take personal responsibility for fucking us all over.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;But but but Hillary would have done the same thing!!!<\/span><br>This goes beyond just Hillary. Most people could see Trump&#039;s flaws from the beginning, and yet most of \/pol\/ lined up behind Trump among all the other candidates.<br>You&#039;re nieve for believing Trump would keep promises in the first place. He&#039;s a salesman. He literally specializes in deception. He&#039;s also rich which pretty much puts him above the law in some cases. I don&#039;t necessarily blame you for falling for his charm, but I&#039;ll have no sympathy when his policies fuck his supporters over.<br>As much as Hillary is a currupt politican, she has enough sense, expertise, and foreign policy experience not to start WW3. Hillary has been doing this shit for decades. Intentional leaders have worked with her in the past and generally like her. She, at the very least, understood that there&#039;s no point of being president if the US becomes an radioactive wasteland. Trump doesn&#039;t understand or care about that threat. He&#039;ll just fly to some private island and blame neocons, jews, democrats, Obama, the media or some other scapegoat.<br><br>It doesn&#039;t matter now, you may have doomed us all.","filename":"IMG_6576","ext":".jpg","w":735,"h":1024,"tn_w":179,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492364098250,"time":1492364098,"md5":"cPHyYGdrBDln6cUOf07afg==","fsize":145241,"resto":0,"id":"g2L8QWLh","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"honestly-why-is-anyone-surprised-by-trumps","country_name":"United States","replies":7,"images":2,"unique_ips":8},{"no":121386808,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)13:38:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"$0.02 has been added to your account","time":1492364316,"resto":121386374,"id":"+N2a6bP0","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121386966,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)13:39:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121386374\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121386374<\/a><br>Nice pasta now make a Yeb! one.","time":1492364390,"resto":121386374,"id":"M1KuYpka","country":"MX","country_name":"Mexico"},{"no":121387087,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)13:40:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121386374\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121386374<\/a><br>Lol saved","time":1492364452,"resto":121386374,"id":"7glYp0M1","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121387218,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)13:41:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121386374\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121386374<\/a><br>I voted for the lulz. <br><br>No good choice existed in the election","filename":"FB_IMG_1492295203148","ext":".jpg","w":480,"h":453,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":117,"tim":1492364511572,"time":1492364511,"md5":"x6Qjjzhgd7IuKIdYqC5Jdg==","fsize":24740,"resto":121386374,"id":"bgTlrQol","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121387557,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)13:44:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"the South will rise again","time":1492364667,"resto":121386374,"id":"rB\/zVhVY","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121388327,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)13:50:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121386374\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121386374<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;implying reduced restrictions on gun sales is a bad thing<\/span><br><br>Shall not be infringed faggot","time":1492365021,"resto":121386374,"id":"tC+Zlcxj","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121389502,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)13:59:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121388327\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121388327<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Muh Constitution<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Sitting president literally called the free press the &quot;enemy of the people&quot;.<\/span><br><br>Fuck off with your sudo-patriotism.","filename":"su8uac0kqlmy","ext":".jpg","w":970,"h":1266,"tn_w":95,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492365577523,"time":1492365577,"md5":"stD0QgWSPjKMcM6A7FoRFg==","fsize":231328,"resto":121386374,"id":"o5J6+Jbq","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"}]}

What should be discussed is how parents raise children nowadays. As I&#039;ve already stated in a previous post, it is not as much of a problem here. In the end, we may look for the root of the problem in urbanisation, but I wouldn&#039;t say it is necessary the main problem as children play(ed) outside in cities as well.","time":1493028744,"resto":122561288,"id":"yINKWzTH","country":"SI","country_name":"Slovenia"},{"no":122570317,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)06:13:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122570038\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122570038<\/a><br>My experience is in the suburbs. We had the streets and some other areas to play in mostly, but those other areas got turned into houses as well. There were a few parks but usually too far away to play in. You needed to stay within a certain distance of your house. Once too many cars started using the streets, you couldn&#039;t play on them either.","time":1493028837,"resto":122561288,"id":"KfUo49WE","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"}]}

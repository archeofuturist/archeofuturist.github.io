When Australia was threatened to be overrun by millions of rabbits breeding out of control they didn&#039;t allow it to happen, they knew it would be an unmitigated ecological disaster and they did what they needed to do to protect themselves and all the other flora and fauna that would be negatively effected. Why don&#039;t we look at Africans the same way? They already can&#039;t feed themselves without massive shipments of foreign food aid, but they, as thoughtless as animals about the matter, and apparently without self-restraint, are projected to quadruple their population in the next few decades. How can we allow this to happen and not treat it like an out of control species that needs to have limits placed on its unchecked growth? We really need to not passively let them overrun the Earth like a plague of locusts or swarm of rodents.","filename":"Homo_Erectus","ext":".jpg","w":835,"h":835,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":124,"tim":1493322886285,"time":1493322886,"md5":"FvoIiWDPudy+yfz\/2iHXIw==","fsize":87230,"resto":123073687,"id":"PfcZoc5a","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123079823,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)16:05:59","name":"k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a","com":"<a href=\"#p123073687\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123073687<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Is it true to say Africa will destroy the world through population.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;One day, at least - maybe hundreds of years later, but inevitably will<\/span>","filename":"CUOkGD6WoAAF-HH","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":833,"tn_w":90,"tn_h":124,"tim":1493323559370,"time":1493323559,"md5":"KgDvtOiWPaBk+lmLoT+qbw==","fsize":80504,"resto":123073687,"id":"wdtMxIlM","country":"GB","trip":"!!8ulOY0Lj8qr","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123080400,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)16:10:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123073687\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123073687<\/a><br>This is a CAT THREAD NOW.","filename":"thread_cannot_be_saved_by_kittens","ext":".jpg","w":262,"h":213,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":101,"tim":1493323834946,"time":1493323834,"md5":"SrkxdS01aYElhxGYqS9LTg==","fsize":25871,"resto":123073687,"id":"wLPSLhRX","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":123080629,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)16:12:16","name":"k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a","com":"<a href=\"#p123075948\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123075948<\/a>","filename":"CV0MTdjWwAEqWsF","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":321,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":66,"tim":1493323936613,"time":1493323936,"md5":"cHN0CLM3Ix9GrcrRfgLnow==","fsize":43204,"resto":123073687,"id":"wdtMxIlM","country":"GB","trip":"!!8ulOY0Lj8qr","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123080796,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)16:13:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123073687\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123073687<\/a><br>The number of children in the world has peaked, the only place that number is still rising is Africa.<br>We either need to develop their economies and health (to transform them into long-life small-family nations) or develop a biological weapon that only latches onto nig DNA.","filename":"image_20160219_162236_851","ext":".jpg","w":2560,"h":1440,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1493324013606,"time":1493324013,"md5":"ShYY+yhNW7K2BhIOdHhMvw==","fsize":773270,"resto":123073687,"id":"vEVrXqhe","country":"GB","m_img":1,"country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123080955,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)16:14:59","name":"k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a","com":"<a href=\"#p123080796\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123080796<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;We either need to develop their economies and health (to transform them into long-life small-family nations) or develop a biological weapon that only latches onto nig DNA.<\/span>","filename":"The Unholy Trinity - Jewish Contribution To Our Suffering World (by Skulz Fontaine)","ext":".jpg","w":1563,"h":1562,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":124,"tim":1493324099413,"time":1493324099,"md5":"cHF2QJe63IM\/9BsMe06pEw==","fsize":1310176,"resto":123073687,"id":"wdtMxIlM","country":"GB","m_img":1,"trip":"!!8ulOY0Lj8qr","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123081190,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)16:16:40","name":"k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a","filename":"1449710259286-2","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":327,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":68,"tim":1493324200976,"time":1493324200,"md5":"bm8egA9mULqLnyowm6cFWw==","fsize":77229,"resto":123073687,"id":"wdtMxIlM","country":"GB","trip":"!!8ulOY0Lj8qr","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123081322,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)16:17:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123073687\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123073687<\/a><br>only if they are let into other countries. if they all just stay in africa, they may end up killing each other, dying from lack of resources (overpopulation), and some are saying that if indeed (((global warming))) does have noticeable effects on the earth, it will effect africa the most. not to mention that africa is constantly dealing with life threatening diseases that spread around. thats why i find it funny when people make projections that the african population with like quadruple in the next few decades. do they really think a bunch of africans will be able to sustain that kind of population growth? they cant even survive now.","time":1493324263,"resto":123073687,"id":"rMN5yDD8","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

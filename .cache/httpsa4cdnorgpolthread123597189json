My GF&#039;s parents have been telling us for the past few months to stock up on ammo, they say to buy as much as we can while we can. Every time we ask them why, they always dismiss it or just ignore it. So my questions is, is there something coming that we don&#039;t know about? Are we in some imminent danger that is gonna require all this ammo?

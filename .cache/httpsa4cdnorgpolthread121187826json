In therapeutic practice (mostly psychodynamic) there is a method of finding where the problem lies. It is by emotional response of anxiety or some other negative powerful emotions that are tied to personal identity. Persons fear of loss of identity or other fear will not let him use logic and rationality to that spot they hold so dear. Like god for example. When you talk with believers a lot of them will tell you that without god life would be meaningless and some will even tell you that they would kill themselves. It is this unconscious fear that produces existential anxiety. There are a lot of mechanisms that strip your rational mind from destroying or exploring it.<br><br>We have to remember that child cant defend against propaganda. They will be molded into a believer because their identity, their self and personality is tied with that information they were fed while defenseless. The elites are evil bastards using the children to mold them into slaves. They will never question their reasoning unless they open up to their negative emotions and rage they hold. That is also why once the society is collapsing people finally wake up because the fear of dying and negative emotions just start to pop without them being able to control them no more. The instincts to survive are stronger because they are hardwired by birth not by learning.","filename":"1491771475272","ext":".jpg","w":960,"h":955,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":124,"tim":1492250757266,"time":1492250757,"md5":"9Iw7eb7LyJQ0fgrs3H65kg==","fsize":87345,"resto":121187826,"id":"xOzWTUEn","country":"SK","country_name":"Slovakia"},{"no":121195284,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)06:06:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121195110\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121195110<\/a><br>Do you believe in a democratic solution?<br>A rightwing party is reigning in Norway.","time":1492250800,"resto":121187826,"id":"3VNIe+KT","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":121195303,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)06:06:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121195096\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121195096<\/a><br>How did this hurt him then?

To have the Swedish-flag as a background when a party-leader was holding speeches was almost considered &quot;nazi&quot; when it was at its worst here. Then when another party-leader of the conservative party did the same it was &quot;flirting with nationalists&quot; and considered bad. Now even the socialists have done the same thing. Our green-party who is the most insane party we have here in Sweden, their leader said recently that illegal immigrants have to leave. That&#039;s the same party that said &quot;No person is illegal&quot; before. Before people would say that the immigration was an economic benefit, if you say that today you will get laughed at. The bigger Swedendemocrats are the more desperate they become.<br><br>One german mentioned in this thread that he didn&#039;t like AfD since they seemed low-IQ compared to the other parties. That&#039;s the German media propaganda doing its work because the media did the exact same thing here in Sweden with the Swedendemocrats. Almost every day you would have some newstory about something retarded a Swedendemocrat had said or done. Because they knew they wouldn&#039;t win the argument so they have to make them look stupid as hell and unfit for governing. When a party is growing quickly it will attract a lot of retards but you will also get a lot of good people, overtime it sorts itself out. The media here would focus only on the Swedendemocrats while completely ignoring the violent communists in the leftist-party. Your main enemy will always be the mainstream media.<br><br>Is there any research done in Germany showing which parties the journalists vote for? Are you allowed to do that over there?<br>Here is the latest one I know of done in Sweden 2011, see the comparison with 2014 election results.<br>https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/C9cy5sU<wbr>XgAAJgs2.jpg","time":1492260978,"resto":121187826,"id":"XVf4L8ck","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":121207783,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)08:59:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121207478\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121207478<\/a><br>Voting AfD is the best tactical solution.","time":1492261191,"resto":121187826,"id":"01sxU0lH","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":121208037,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)09:02:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121192488\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121192488<\/a><br>Lately I&#039;ve been watching German political talkshows about issues like Trump, immigration, AfD and the EU.

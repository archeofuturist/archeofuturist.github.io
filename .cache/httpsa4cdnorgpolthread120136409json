It accomplished a number of things with minimal loss of life and only damage to some Tarmac. <br><br>1. It sends a warning to China and North Korea that they have to take Trump seriously and US military might seriously. We now have a leader that has the balls to commit to military action if needed. <br><br>2. It solidifies his support domestically. As much as I wish that McCain and his ilk would get hit by a bus, the fact is that he and his buddies still account for a sizable number of republican votes in congress. This probably also allowed him to secure their support for the nuclear option to get Gorsuch confirmed. <br><br>3. This will end the whole bs story of Russia fixing the election and Trump being a double agent or whatever retarded thing the media is saying these days. This gives him more overhead coverage to pursue things like Susan Rice illegally spying on and unmasking American citizens, specifically Trumps campaign team. <br><br>4. Despite the rhetoric this is unlikely to severely damage US\/Russia relations. It&#039;s a limited strike that didn&#039;t cause any severe damage and in some ways legitimized the standing of the Assad regime (we tend to hold recognized governments responsible for the use of chemical weapons, this was a direct response to a legitimate, recognized government using chemical weapons). <br><br>Quit with all the black pill bitching.

To be rich you have to 1. be American because other countries don&#039;t truly have options for the non rich 2. go to an ivy league(my dad went to a French one and we are upper middle class so again has to be in America) 3. Don&#039;t fuck up and you&#039;ll get hired and make 150k a year which should imo put you in the rich club. Then it&#039;s all on you wether you want to start investing or build you&#039;re own company to start making stupid amounts for no reason except you&#039;re ego and greed. <br>Now if you&#039;re not born in America try doing an MBA in America learn to think American or be reallly reallly really lucky and innovate in your home country it might work.

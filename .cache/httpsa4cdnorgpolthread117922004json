It is not a <br>philosophy to live by. It is negative. Nietzsche was at <br>his best as a negative thinker, destroying anything in his <br>path by examining every moral concept from previously <br>un-thought of perspectives, rather than the &#039;frog&#039; <br>perspectives of normal thinkers.<br><br>But he was a profoundly sickly man as well. He was the opposite <br>of the strong, virile hero type - the Homeric hero, for <br>instance, which he studied as a young man. He failed with <br>women, he was wracked with painful ailments, knew he was <br>dying, losing his mind, alone.<br><br>He was a self-hater and idolized his opposite - the super man. <br>His positive philosophy, if you call it that, is no better <br>grounded then the ones he criticized. It is grounded in his <br>own, personal self loathing as much as Kant&#039;s was grounded <br>in his own personal self-aggrandizing (Kant was notoriously <br>stoical; to Nietzsche, this meant Kant was able to overcome <br>his passions and desires - tyrannize them - and Kant&#039;s moral <br>philosophy told others to similarly obey, obey, obey the <br>duties imposed on them).<br><br>In short, one needs faith by which to live, not logic without <br>a faith to ground it.

Naumann. In it, following K\u00f6selitz&#039; suggestion she included a selection from Nietzsche&#039;s posthumous fragments, which was gathered together and entitled The Will To Power. She claimed that this text was substantially the magnum opus, which Nietzsche had hoped to write and name &quot;The Will to Power, An Attempt at a Revaluation of All Values&quot;. The first German edition, containing 483 sections, published in 1901, was edited by K\u00f6selitz, Ernst Horneffer, and August Horneffer, under Elisabeth&#039;s direction.

In fact, if Nietzsche did consider producing such a book, he had abandoned such plans in the months before his collapse. The title of The Will to Power, which appears for the first time at the end of the summer of 1885, was replaced by another plan at the end of August 1888.

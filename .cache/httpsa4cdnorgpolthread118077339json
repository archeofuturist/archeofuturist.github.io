You&#039;ll need 2 years minimum Infantry experience before you can even consider SASR\/Commando Regiment<br><br>2. You&#039;ll basically need to be one of the top of your Battalion when it comes to Weapons Handling, Fieldcraft, and all the other shit that&#039;s involved with being Infantry<br><br>3. You&#039;ll essentially be headhunted by both Regiments, hence why you&#039;ll need to be one of the best in your Battalion, so you get noticed. Skill wise that is, not the shitcunt that goes around talking yourself up<br><br>3. If you do somehow manage to get selected to go on to the Selection Course, make sure you do as much PT as you can, without over doing it. And when you get tired as fuck, do more. Having said that, its more mental than physical. The physical side of it they can train you up for, but you still need to be able to hit times that are better than Reg units, obviously. But the mental side of things can&#039;t be trained to a degree. That leads to the next point....<br><br>4. Know that if you do somehow get headhunted by them, IT IS 90% MENTAL. They&#039;re looking for the blokes that can operate on little to no sleep, under intense pressure, while still being able to make rational, intelligent decisions in quick times. <br><br>From what I know, the best way to look at it is this way - when doing Selection, DON&#039;T. EVER. GIVE. UP.<br><br>When your at your lowest, keep going, if you thought you failed, keep going, if you want to quit, keep fucking going. Do it hour by hour. Push yourself to make the next hour. And when you make that hour, push yourself to make the next hour.<br><br>And always remember, the Selection Instructors are always going to be trying to get you to quit. Unless you are injured enough to have to stop, if the SIs ask if you want to quit, NOPE, keep going.<br><br>5. Always do as the SIs instruct you. Nothing more, nothing less. Follow instructions, don&#039;t try to be the standout, and at the same time, don&#039;t be the shitcunt.","time":1490362289,"resto":118077339,"id":"oA2VNN9W","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":118080823,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)09:35:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118079399\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118079399<\/a><br><br>Heh, there&#039;s the old saying - SASR are the ones you send in when you want to take out 1 guy, and leave the enemy wondering what the fuck just happened, and the Commando Regiment are the ones you send in when you want to flatten the whole town. <br><br><a href=\"#p118080530\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118080530<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;mfw I forgot mfw<\/span>","filename":"IMG_1876","ext":".jpg","w":285,"h":327,"tn_w":108,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490362508677,"time":1490362508,"md5":"iPrmQjnS9yFtT\/CG7FmzXQ==","fsize":22139,"resto":118077339,"id":"oA2VNN9W","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":118081474,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)09:43:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118080530\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118080530<\/a><br><br>Oh, and the most important thing, you are ALWAYS being watched and evaluated.

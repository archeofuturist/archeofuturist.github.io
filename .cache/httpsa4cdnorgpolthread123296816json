The anti-Trump director was targeting Republican Speaker of the House Paul Ryan when he referred to the young women who beat cancer during their childhood as &quot;Not a 10.&quot;<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Ryan apparently caught the eye of Whedon on Thursday, when the speaker posted a photo of the meeting he and the young girls had in Washington. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;Advocacy is not limited to adults. These Wisconsin teens shared some powerful stories with me about their fight against childhood cancer,&quot; wrote Ryan. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The teens lending their hands to fight against childhood cancer belong to One Step Camp, which offers &quot;camp experiences and other programs throughout the year that allow children with cancer to just be kids. Our programs offer fun, friendship and support in a safe and nurturing environment,&quot; according to the camp&#039;s official website. &quot;Through the magic of childhood experiences, we help kids diagnosed with cancer reclaim their lives.&quot;<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Soon after the despicable post, Whelen was hit with condemnation from both sides of the aisle. He promptly deleted the post and offered a &quot;apology,&quot; which simply stated that he offended the wrong people:<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;So I tweeted something that inadvertently offended everyone except the people I was trying to offend. I&#039;m sorry. I&#039;ll be quiet for a bit.&quot;<\/span><br><br>http:\/\/www.dailywire.com\/news\/15865<wbr>\/anti-trump-director-mocks-cancer-s<wbr>urvivors-when-amanda-prestigiacomo","filename":"joss tweet","ext":".jpg","w":514,"h":555,"tn_w":231,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493441148786,"time":1493441148,"md5":"xHTI2UsY3W5P2rdcYD1\/kg==","fsize":28426,"resto":0,"id":"vAw7\/2RO","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"joss-whedon-mocks-teenage-cancer-survivors-while","country_name":"United States","replies":6,"images":0,"unique_ips":6},{"no":123296934,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)00:47:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123296816\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123296816<\/a><br>They know he is gay.","time":1493441229,"resto":123296816,"id":"2OwoKrNw","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123296992,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)00:47:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123296816\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123296816<\/a><br>Paul Ryan is a faggot and Joss Whedon was only good when he did Firefly and Serenity, other than that he can fuck off","time":1493441265,"resto":123296816,"id":"Z41hIYnF","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123299179,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)01:15:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123296992\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123296992<\/a><br>Firefly sucked ass dude.","time":1493442943,"resto":123296816,"id":"I9YmIC2g","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123299842,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)01:23:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123296816\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123296816<\/a><br>Making fun of Trump for looking for hot young wives?<br>Is Joss just salty that he&#039;s stuck with his ugly beard wife now that he is rich and famous enough that he could force aspiring actors to fuck him.","time":1493443424,"resto":123296816,"id":"Cwo2m0Vo","country":"KY","country_name":"Cayman Islands"},{"no":123299979,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)01:25:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123299179\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123299179<\/a><br>This.

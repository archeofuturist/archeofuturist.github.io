Then we bombed a couple, (((Arab Spring))) happened, and suddenly it turned out that those evil dictators were in fact pretty good at maintaining the stability in their countries, and the opposition was nothing but bloodthirsty suffis and wahhabis. And then it turned out those far away countries were in fact very close, and literally guarded the doors to Europe, and they&#039;re just across the Mediterranean sea, that people can cross on shitty boats, and beacuse we&#039;re good guys, when their shitty boats sink, we rescue them.<br><br>Now there&#039;s only two countries that are protecting Europe from a full-scale invasion: Turkey, and Algeria. Turkey is well-aware of its strength and influence, and threatens to open the floodgates, and they&#039;ll certainly do it, but they&#039;re not the bigget threat. The biggest is Algeria. Its president, Abdelaziz Bouteflika, is dying. And he&#039;s the one holding the entire Maghreb by the balls, and keeping it stable. The day he dies, Maghreb will collapse, neither Egypt nor Morroco will survive it. And Europe will follow soon after.","time":1491208221,"resto":119306363,"id":"TEJkLOY9","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":119307469,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)04:32:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119306363\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119306363<\/a><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=UtH<wbr>7iv4ip1U","time":1491208326,"resto":119306363,"id":"SHNPPQxm","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119307531,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)04:33:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119307366\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119307366<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;French flag<\/span><br>Should&#039;ve kept algeria a colony tbqh","time":1491208394,"resto":119306363,"id":"K7XrizhJ","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":119307625,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)04:34:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119306363\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119306363<\/a><br>You can have all the niggers europoors<br>FUCK THE EU<br>FUCK THE US<br>FUCK GADDAFI<br>FUCK THE REBELS","filename":"aoss","ext":".jpg","w":720,"h":720,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491208476954,"time":1491208476,"md5":"02b6w4z0+4y1zUujABE2+g==","fsize":51269,"resto":119306363,"id":"WhQEARcQ","country":"LY","country_name":"Libya"},{"no":119307895,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)04:39:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119306363\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119306363<\/a><br>fun fact: he was killed by someone ramming a bayonet up his anus","time":1491208761,"resto":119306363,"id":"t9D5H8KU","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119308176,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)04:43:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119307895\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119307895<\/a><br>no that was just for all &quot;the rapes&quot; his soldiers did(fake news by AlJazeera and CNN)<br>they sodomized him with rifles and other gross shit.","time":1491209014,"resto":119306363,"id":"WhQEARcQ","country":"LY","country_name":"Libya"}]}

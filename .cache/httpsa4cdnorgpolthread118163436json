First of all, there is a direct correlation between the ethnic homogeneity in a society and the level of trust among individuals within that society, pic related. If your society is filled with all different races and all different weird mixes of those different races, you&#039;re going to have a very low-trust society. This is because people tend to be implicitly biased in favor of those that are more alike them, and two people of the same race will always be more alike genetically than two people of different races.<br><br>People also tend to identify and empathize more easily with those that are more alike to them, this is why you see companies always use minorities in their posters and pamphlets when they\u2019re trying to seem \u2018diverse\u2019. This presents a problem for mixed people because in our present society they are a very small minority. Who do they identify with? There\u2019s no historical tradition for them to fall back on because mixing race is a very modern thing and there\u2019s no present role models for them to identify with. They\u2019re a people without a nation and they often serve as a fifth column to the people in the country that are unmixed because it\u2019s in the interest of the mixed to make everyone as mixed-up and nation-less as them. They are the ultimate agents of globalization and liberalism.","filename":"4cd2ab6843edf871e653a35422080a1265675356f8b1503cf6ba05823563a274","ext":".jpg","w":504,"h":393,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":97,"tim":1490404674911,"time":1490404674,"md5":"M6vOsp8HFSdTlDXri+O0qA==","fsize":17505,"resto":118163436,"id":"vHVGJUZD","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118164113,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)21:18:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118163436\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118163436<\/a><br>nothing wrong with marrying a beautiful black wife and having waffle colored children with her, just make sure if shes black that she has a nice ass and nice tits- dont settle for anything less than atleast a 9\/10.","filename":"1475511668289","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":441,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":110,"tim":1490404694690,"time":1490404694,"md5":"E3Tj6ubGnCiuJFR9OGmMsw==","fsize":42892,"resto":118163436,"id":"sR7sSXtn","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118164133,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)21:18:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118164069\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118164069<\/a><br>And this isn&#039;t even going into the disparity among races as far as factors like intelligence go. Statistically, a society of white people is going to be more intelligent, more peaceful, and overall more successful than a society of half-black\/half-white people, or a society of half-amerindian\/half-white people. You could argue that on average white people aren\u2019t the absolute smartest, but we seem to be the best at creating wealthy and successful nations for whatever reason, so it would seem to be in our interest to keep it that way.<br><br>Lastly, there should be something said about ethnocentrism. See my link below, ethnocentrism as an evolutionary strategy is the dominant strategy over humanitarianism, individual self-interest, and ethno-traitorousness. If your ethnicity mixes together with everyone else, ethnocentrism as a strategy is obviously not possible for your people. White people and the Western culture we\u2019ve created work very well as an ethnicity, we have a rich history and I see no reason to throw it all away because \u201clol why not xDDDDDD\u201d. If we were merely to realize the power we have, like we did prior to all of this globalism bullshit, we\u2019d be able to rule this planet as a nation of kings.<br><br>http:\/\/jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk\/16\/3\/<wbr>7.html","filename":"7d61e5ee7c6911f7655fbb59882370cdb29d046d95376e6e070dddf0139d69e2","ext":".gif","w":2970,"h":2400,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":101,"tim":1490404702547,"time":1490404702,"md5":"atqEdn1If5y7c0RAsDhMnA==","fsize":871581,"resto":118163436,"id":"vHVGJUZD","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118164187,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)21:18:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118163436\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118163436<\/a><br>I&#039;m half jap and half white with some Russian in my jap side from the Russo Japanese war. <br><br>My granny was race mixing a century before this meme. <br><br>But ya.

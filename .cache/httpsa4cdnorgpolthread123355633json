Trust me, after a few decades let&#039;s say in 2030 ad max 40 the populace that were fed and accepted this will wake up because the &quot;new people&quot; will be the majority and thus their privilege of keeping their eyes closed on racial issues be it from being forced or on purpose would be impossible to maintain. The problem is that when people wake up it will be too late to save Europa and the intelligent and wise folk would&#039;ve moved to somewhere more stable so there&#039;s no getting back to how things were before this... abomination took place. Europe will fall(Russia included) and WWIII is an inescapable outcome.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;We need to spread this kind of information.<\/span><br>Hah, not like people haven&#039;t tried to do it before. You&#039;re free to do anything but you can&#039;t force the truth upon people, they need to seek it themselves. Spamming anti-migration or racist propaganda like \/pol\/ does only makes the enemy stronger. <br>I&#039;m sure they could just outright say &quot;Europe needs to accept Islam as an official religion&quot; tomorrow and nothing will happen. Nobody will do anything, not even those extreme right-wing skinheads or the white pride types in Scandinavian countries will do much if anything at all because everyone is powerless against this beast but nobody will easily admit it out of pride.","filename":"tower-painting-poster","ext":".jpg","w":1000,"h":750,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1493489444389,"time":1493489444,"md5":"KpjMxJkdemBlDzNDL48aAA==","fsize":334918,"resto":123355633,"id":"SvGJerRK","country":"BG","country_name":"Bulgaria"}]}

By 2014, she and her husband, investment banker Paul Pelosi, were doing even better: She reported between $43.4 million and $202 million in assets. (Pelosi\u2019s husband, in fact, has done so well that he tried the quixotic hobby of investing in an alternative to the National Football League, losing between $100,000 and $1 million in 2014.)<br><br>http:\/\/www.nationalreview.com\/artic<wbr>le\/420574\/nancy-pelosis-life-01-per<wbr>cent-brooke-rogers","filename":"Screen Shot 2017-04-14 at 8.46.13 AM","ext":".png","w":1272,"h":1118,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":219,"tim":1492174005934,"time":1492174005,"md5":"Ksab\/xbQtjDwNhesSBYXTw==","fsize":1470660,"resto":0,"id":"OyfIqQQy","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":1,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"san-francisco-building-200-mil-suicide-barrier","country_name":"United States","replies":345,"images":68,"unique_ips":189,"tail_size":50},{"no":121056214,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)08:47:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121056129\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121056129<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;America needs a wall to stop them killing themselves<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Still no Mexico border wall<\/span><br><br>AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAAAA<wbr>AHAAAAAA","filename":"datfreedom","ext":".png","w":1066,"h":813,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":95,"tim":1492174065215,"time":1492174065,"md5":"BtQicP1\/JntPvK6IBl2EZA==","fsize":530057,"resto":121056129,"id":"tHKMDkOI","country":"GB","m_img":1,"country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121056256,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)08:48:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121056129\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121056129<\/a><br>What a disgusting waste of a city and land.

On August 11, 1930, the War Department issued its final permit for the construction of a 4,200-foot main span with a vertical clearance of 220 feet at mid-span. On August 27, 1930, Joseph Strauss submitted final plans to the Golden Gate Bridge and Highway District Board of Directors. In November 1932, contracts totaling $23,843,905 were awarded for the construction of the Golden Gate Bridge. The authorized bond issue was for $35 million and the total construction cost came in at $35 million which included $27,125,000 for the construction of the structure, $2,050,000 for Engineering and Inspection, $423,000 for Administrative and Preliminary Expenses, $4,068,000 for Financing, and $1,334,000 in surplus. The $27 million for final construction of the span is higher than the $23 million for the initial construction bids as other items were included in the final cost such as the toll plaza ($450,000), toll collection equipment ($72,000), tower elevators ($60,000), miscellaneous equipment ($45,000), and Military replacements and improvements ($575,000).<br><br>http:\/\/goldengatebridge.org\/researc<wbr>h\/ConstructionPrimeContr.php","time":1492174429,"resto":121056129,"id":"OyfIqQQy","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121056771,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)08:54:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121056256\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121056256<\/a><br>Do it then, faggot","time":1492174454,"resto":121056129,"id":"04CreKw0","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121056825,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)08:54:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121056262\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121056262<\/a><br>This is the same state that thought you could preserve water by putting black balls on it<br><br>http:\/\/news.nationalgeographic.com\/<wbr>2015\/08\/150812-shade-balls-los-ange<wbr>les-California-drought-water-enviro<wbr>nment\/<br><br>http:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/science\/2015<wbr>\/08\/19\/la-black-ball-scheme-disaste<wbr>r-in-making-say-experts.html<br><br>reminder this is the state that voted for Hillary","time":1492174498,"resto":121056129,"id":"BuNU+Y+n","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121056837,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)08:55:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121056129\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121056129<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;land on net<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;crawl to edge<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;continue suicide<\/span><br><br>Full fucking retard","time":1492174505,"resto":121056129,"id":"lIrfj25L","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121056924,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)08:56:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121056564\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121056564<\/a><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=mn_<wbr>hDivyfVU","time":1492174560,"resto":121056129,"id":"mdzRkldb","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":121056948,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)08:56:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"$200 million dollars to keep people from killing themselves with some style.

In 1953, a bridge supervisor named Mervin Lewis rejected an early proposal for a barrier by saying it was preferable that suicides jump into the Bay than dive off a building \u201cand maybe kill somebody else.\u201d (It\u2019s a public-safety issue.) Although this belief makes intuitive sense, it is demonstrably untrue. Dr. Seiden\u2019s study, \u201cWhere Are They Now?,\u201d published in 1978, followed up on five hundred and fifteen people who were prevented from attempting suicide at the bridge between 1937 and 1971. After, on average, more than twenty-six years, ninety-four per cent of the would-be suicides were either still alive or had died of natural causes. \u201cThe findings confirm previous observations that suicidal behavior is crisis-oriented and acute in nature,\u201d Seiden concluded; if you can get a suicidal person through his crisis\u2014Seiden put the high-risk period at ninety days\u2014chances are extremely good that he won\u2019t kill himself later.<\/span>","time":1492177696,"resto":121056129,"id":"F1pyKrJd","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":121061702,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)09:48:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"we have a twin of this bridge in lisbon.<br><br>you could put a train under it for that kind of money.","filename":"image","ext":".jpg","w":744,"h":495,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":83,"tim":1492177700692,"time":1492177700,"md5":"wqHawpbMhnZoYN\/yaG4qhg==","fsize":55020,"resto":121056129,"id":"hHNbwDN4","country":"PT","country_name":"Portugal"},{"no":121061703,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)09:48:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121058818\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121058818<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Be burger<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;You can kill babies if they inconvenience you<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;But you can&#039;t kill yourself if you&#039;re inconvenienced<\/span>","time":1492177700,"resto":121056129,"id":"6DKDO+XN","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":121061757,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)09:48:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121056129\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121056129<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;federal sources<\/span><br>Whoa, whoa, whoa--isn&#039;t this a sanctuary city?

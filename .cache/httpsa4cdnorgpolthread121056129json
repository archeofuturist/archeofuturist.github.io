By 2014, she and her husband, investment banker Paul Pelosi, were doing even better: She reported between $43.4 million and $202 million in assets. (Pelosi\u2019s husband, in fact, has done so well that he tried the quixotic hobby of investing in an alternative to the National Football League, losing between $100,000 and $1 million in 2014.)<br><br>http:\/\/www.nationalreview.com\/artic<wbr>le\/420574\/nancy-pelosis-life-01-per<wbr>cent-brooke-rogers","filename":"Screen Shot 2017-04-14 at 8.46.13 AM","ext":".png","w":1272,"h":1118,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":219,"tim":1492174005934,"time":1492174005,"md5":"Ksab\/xbQtjDwNhesSBYXTw==","fsize":1470660,"resto":0,"id":"OyfIqQQy","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"san-francisco-building-200-mil-suicide-barrier","country_name":"United States","replies":81,"images":19,"unique_ips":66},{"no":121056214,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)08:47:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121056129\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121056129<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;America needs a wall to stop them killing themselves<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Still no Mexico border wall<\/span><br><br>AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAAAA<wbr>AHAAAAAA","filename":"datfreedom","ext":".png","w":1066,"h":813,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":95,"tim":1492174065215,"time":1492174065,"md5":"BtQicP1\/JntPvK6IBl2EZA==","fsize":530057,"resto":121056129,"id":"tHKMDkOI","country":"GB","m_img":1,"country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121056256,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)08:48:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121056129\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121056129<\/a><br>What a disgusting waste of a city and land.

On August 11, 1930, the War Department issued its final permit for the construction of a 4,200-foot main span with a vertical clearance of 220 feet at mid-span. On August 27, 1930, Joseph Strauss submitted final plans to the Golden Gate Bridge and Highway District Board of Directors. In November 1932, contracts totaling $23,843,905 were awarded for the construction of the Golden Gate Bridge. The authorized bond issue was for $35 million and the total construction cost came in at $35 million which included $27,125,000 for the construction of the structure, $2,050,000 for Engineering and Inspection, $423,000 for Administrative and Preliminary Expenses, $4,068,000 for Financing, and $1,334,000 in surplus. The $27 million for final construction of the span is higher than the $23 million for the initial construction bids as other items were included in the final cost such as the toll plaza ($450,000), toll collection equipment ($72,000), tower elevators ($60,000), miscellaneous equipment ($45,000), and Military replacements and improvements ($575,000).<br><br>http:\/\/goldengatebridge.org\/researc<wbr>h\/ConstructionPrimeContr.php","time":1492174429,"resto":121056129,"id":"OyfIqQQy","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121056771,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)08:54:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121056256\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121056256<\/a><br>Do it then, faggot","time":1492174454,"resto":121056129,"id":"04CreKw0","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121056825,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)08:54:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121056262\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121056262<\/a><br>This is the same state that thought you could preserve water by putting black balls on it<br><br>http:\/\/news.nationalgeographic.com\/<wbr>2015\/08\/150812-shade-balls-los-ange<wbr>les-California-drought-water-enviro<wbr>nment\/<br><br>http:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/science\/2015<wbr>\/08\/19\/la-black-ball-scheme-disaste<wbr>r-in-making-say-experts.html<br><br>reminder this is the state that voted for Hillary","time":1492174498,"resto":121056129,"id":"BuNU+Y+n","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121056837,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)08:55:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121056129\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121056129<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;land on net<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;crawl to edge<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;continue suicide<\/span><br><br>Full fucking retard","time":1492174505,"resto":121056129,"id":"lIrfj25L","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121056924,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)08:56:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121056564\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121056564<\/a><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=mn_<wbr>hDivyfVU","time":1492174560,"resto":121056129,"id":"mdzRkldb","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":121056948,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)08:56:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"$200 million dollars to keep people from killing themselves with some style.

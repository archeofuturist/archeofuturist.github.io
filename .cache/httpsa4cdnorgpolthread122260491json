But theyre so diluted i dont believe theyre salvageable. How has history dealt with a political setting like this before? where the only two sides are polar opposites and they continue to separate until an ultimatum shows itself?","filename":"an","ext":".png","w":1152,"h":648,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1492855163331,"time":1492855163,"md5":"y7FU3WejBsJkErpIhv1\/Fw==","fsize":541677,"resto":0,"id":"X2YsWHPs","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"ranarchism","country_name":"United States","replies":14,"images":4,"unique_ips":15},{"no":122260612,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)06:01:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122260491\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122260491<\/a><br>You can only kill commies, son.","time":1492855280,"resto":122260491,"id":"Ni0aGrUf","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122260631,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)06:01:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"well in the past what we did with these types is throw them in happy camps until the (((allies))) liberated","time":1492855297,"resto":122260491,"id":"WWpARCFJ","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":122260667,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)06:02:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122260491\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122260491<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;How has history dealt with a political setting like this before? where the only two sides are polar opposites and they continue to separate until an ultimatum shows itself?<\/span><br><br>this question got me thinking that you might be trolling","time":1492855324,"resto":122260491,"id":"4mG95aPU","country":"DK","country_name":"Denmark"},{"no":122260749,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)06:03:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122260612\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122260612<\/a><br>\/thread","filename":"1488328581853","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":497,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":124,"tim":1492855392476,"time":1492855392,"md5":"GRkbcJ7aJOUEnG3NFrzTEw==","fsize":81368,"resto":122260491,"id":"zrvgkGjz","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122260855,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)06:04:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122260491\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122260491<\/a><br>Here in Spain we solved almost the same conflict with a 3 year civil war :,)","time":1492855467,"resto":122260491,"id":"rBBtZfsB","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":122260952,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)06:05:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122260612\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122260612<\/a><br>Fpbp","time":1492855555,"resto":122260491,"id":"p7acdkbK","country":"IT","country_name":"Italy"},{"no":122260957,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)06:06:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"The difference is that we&#039;re the rejects of society, the outcasts, and as such are able to observe the world and society from a third-party perspective and figure out what&#039;s really up.

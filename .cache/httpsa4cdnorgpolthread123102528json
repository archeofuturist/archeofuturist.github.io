I know we have big problems. I&#039;m making a direct comparison. I&#039;m saying that we understood the value of returning to and rebuilding the cities. Of building homes locally for refugees so they could remain in their original community. Leaving syria creates a massive drain on manpower in the future. The country cant be defended or rebuilt. The best course of action is to keep the refugees close to their home country and then return them there after the war to begin an aggressive rebuilding scheme which would probably result in a richer syria anyway.<br><br>Taking people out of the country permanently simply means extending the problem in perpetuity - it never ends, because no one wants to be there ever again. Its like letting Gypsies ravage your vineyards when you could have just given them the tools to build their own nearby.","time":1493334776,"resto":123102528,"id":"LXgvu7L7","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"}]}

Trump chose the Obama-hired Customs and Border deputy who was tasked with enacting Obama\u2019s open border vision to lead the parent agency of Border Patrol, Customs and Border Protection (CBP). All of the Border Patrol agents who spoke with Breitbart Texas Managing Director Brandon Darby from all nine Southwest border sectors expressed feeling betrayed or otherwise hurt by Trump choosing a man who did so much damage to them to be their new boss. Many expressed regret for having supported Trump in the first place and for having believed he would actually listen to them and care about what they experienced while risking their lives for other Americans.<\/span><br><br>http:\/\/www.breitbart.com\/texas\/2017<wbr>\/04\/05\/brandon-darby-border-patrol-<wbr>agents-feel-betrayed-trump-administ<wbr>ration\/","filename":"1491647363541","ext":".jpg","w":900,"h":531,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":147,"tim":1491744370396,"time":1491744370,"md5":"ub63qBdE1W1wZxp7xhVs1A==","fsize":111361,"resto":0,"id":"1P+oi7eG","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"border-patrol-agents-feel-betrayed-by-trump","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

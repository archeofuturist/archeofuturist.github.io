I have no doubt that Tarentino is a leftist nigger-dick sucking faggot, but you cannot possibly watch that movie and not become aware of the deliberate irony of its juxtapositions.<br><br>Name one admirable character from that film. Ask ANY normie to say who the coolest character from that film was. I&#039;ve done it, and every single one said either Brad Pitt or the German officer they killed in the beginning, and everyone who says Brad Pitt will go &quot;oh yeah&quot; if you remind them of that German officer.<br><br>It was a film about the sheer hypocrisy of how we treat war in entertainment. That one moment, &quot;Bravery.&quot; was the most human moment in the entire film. It was like watching the ending to a much, much better movie from the perspective of the villains.<br><br>And what about the Nazis all howling and clapping like idiots to a dumb action movie about killing Americans, followed by a gratuitous, cartoonish murder of the entire audience and of Adolf Hitler by a guy with an assault rifle?<br><br>I&#039;m not sure what to think about Tarentino because it is not possible to have written satire that perfect unintentionally. He has to have known what he was doing. For many people, myself included, that was the beginning of my disdain for the narrative of WWII which had been shoved up our asses since we were children. I grew up watching cartoon buffoon nazis fight Donald Duck and Bugs Bunny. I grew up shooting goofy Nazis in medal of honor and call of duty and all of this shit and it had never been that REAL before. Even Saving Private Ryan had the one Nazi they showed mercy to betray them in a cruel and brutal way.<br><br>This was the first time, ever, that we just saw a Nazi face death with courage for no other reason than that the &quot;good guys&quot; were bitter, violent, stupid criminal assholes. It was the turning point. Did Tarentino know how many people looked into that officer&#039;s blue eyes, and identify with him, instead of Brad Pitt?","time":1491215590,"resto":119313090,"id":"LSabbiJm","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119314546,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)06:33:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119313739\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119313739<\/a><br>&quot;Nazis&quot; never made movies like this.<br>This is Hollywood jew trash made by a faggot.","time":1491215630,"resto":119313090,"id":"Q8YoLCfr","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119314678,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)06:35:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"You got to look at it as an alternate universe outcome of WW2 that sets up the universe for the rest of his movies with a culture that glorifies violence, hard dudes, sexy\/strong women and movie references.","time":1491215757,"resto":119313090,"id":"\/B0NBOh4","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119314724,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)06:36:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119313090\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119313090<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;all the jews in the squad where your typical ugly, arrogant, disgusting, annoying sounding pale kikes<\/span><br><br>It&#039;s like the movie was made by and just for jews, non of them where likeable at all, even the main kike &quot;bear jew&quot; has a screechy voice and looked like an inbred kike<br><br>Almost all the German soldiers and officers where likable or where interesting on the other hand, maybe expect for Hitler himself but they where diff better<br><br>the movie tho was shit in my opinion, I found Furry better","time":1491215805,"resto":119313090,"id":"YbC1vsZ0","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119315029,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)06:41:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119313458\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119313458<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;wehrmacht soldiers portrayed as well, spoken, well educated gentlemen displaying nothing but cunning, bravery and humanity.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;american jews behaving like savages and scalping people.<\/span><br>The part in the theater where people are cheering at the movie when he&#039;s killing american soldiers and how it progresses to cheering in the actual theater when the nazis get massacred.

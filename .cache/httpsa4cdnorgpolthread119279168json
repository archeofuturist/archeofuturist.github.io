Lost in identity, lost in faith, lost and slowly sinking into nihilism and self-destructive behavior. And it&#039;s breaking me to see her in that state because, all I can do is watch. I care about her very deeply but I&#039;ve been feeling powerless, unable to help her.<br><br>Because if you could see through my eyes:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;How bright she can shine when she&#039;s happy.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;How her whole face radiates when she smiles.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;How she sunddenly bursts into these little dances of hers and you can read the rhythm through her movements.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;How strong and fragile she is.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;How she laughs at dank memes and dark jokes but moreso, how she apologizes for trying to avoid or calm our little fights by using said memes and jokes.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;How she sings with her soul<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;How she loves occult and witchcraft but also rainbows<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;How excited she was to show me her Pepes folder.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;How she imbues love and passion in everything she does.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;How she bites me and always reminds me that people often bite people unconsciously because they love them.

I think she&#039;s not the only one who feels lost. Can&#039;t you feel the ripples of the wave of nihilism hurting us? Affecting us through our collective unconscious? Begging us to give up and self-destruct. You can see it in the wave of suicidal and self-loathing memes that&#039;s hitting us right now.

She was not an ordinary princess, however. This Princess loved to play alone in the palace gardens while she tossed around her favourite beaming golden ball.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Now, the problem with playing alone was that no one was ever there to catch the ball if she tossed it too high in the air. One day, as she was running around lilies and daisies and hedges and roses, she tossed her ball higher in the air than she ever had before.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;SPLASH!!<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Her beautiful golden ball had plopped right into a small pond nearby!

So the frog goes down into the water and then brings up the most important thing, her golden ball. So, the princess is forced, unwillingly, to let the frog into her house, eat from her plate and finally, let him into her bed. But by doing that, the frog transforms into a handsome young prince, right before her eyes.<\/span>","time":1491186445,"resto":119279168,"id":"DyS3Dilt","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119279225,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)22:27:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;The Prince informed her that an evil witch had put a spell on him and only a kiss could return him back to his original state.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Forever after, the Prince and Princess were able to play together in the palace gardens.

And inside the snitch is part of Voldemort&#039;s soul. That&#039;s part of the soul of evil that&#039;s inside the golden ball. So, the gods are speaking to you when anything flickers in front of you and captures your attention. In the quidditch games, the person who follows what captures his attention is the seeker. And also the person who wins not so much the game, but the meta-game.<br><br>Also, the golden ball in Harry Potter has wings, which makes it a round chaos. Technically speaking it&#039;s an alchemical symbol. And a round chaos is a mercurial symbol and the spirit Mercury is an emissary of the gods. Also symbolic of Mercury, the Caduceus is a figure of two serpents wrapped around a center rod. The rod is a symbol of transforming alchemical power. The two serpents represent polarity or duality. Together with the sprouted wings depict the caduceus having an alchemical meaning of balance, duality and following the alchemical process leading to unity. The caduceus is also seen in medical circles. This is a logical match as the caduceus calls for unity and balance on an internal level and is hailed as a symbol for healing.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Harry Potter had the Resurrection Stone (in the golden snitch), the Cloak of Invisibility and the Elder Wand, which made him the Master of Death and ultimately helped him complete his quest.<\/span>","time":1491186462,"resto":119279168,"id":"DyS3Dilt","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119279250,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)22:28:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Frodo Baggins had the Phial of Galadriel, the One Ring and his sword Snitch, which helped him complete his quest.<\/span><br><br>The point I want to make here is that on some level, Harry Potter and Frodo Baggins are both representations, in our culture, of the mythological archetype that Jesus Christ embodies.

From an evolutionary perspective, anything that is &quot;true enough&quot; to help you survive and reproduce is indeed &quot;real.&quot; Therefore, the mythological archetypes and stories, which have evolved (for very deep and important reasons) and can help guide action, are in fact real. They&#039;re real parts of our existence.

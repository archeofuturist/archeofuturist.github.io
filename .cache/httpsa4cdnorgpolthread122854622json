Science says there are only two genders!\u201d in response to Bill Nye covering gender and sexuality on Bill Nye Saves the World.<br><br>\u2026Like, did they even listen to what he said? Have they read any peer-reviewed literature about the subject? Is their understanding of \u201cgender\u201d limited to a middle school understanding of X and Y chromosomes? Bill Nye addressed chromosomes, hormones, genitalia and secondary sex characteristics when talking about how some of us don\u2019t fit into the male\/female sex dichotomy, and brought up psychology and neuroscience when talking about gender and its difference from sex, and also sexuality. The actual science of sex, gender and sexuality across the animal kingdom and across human behaviour is far more interesting than \u201clol nope science says there are only two genders.\u201d <br><br>It honestly makes me angry when people say \u201clol I thought this was about science\u201d whenever a scientist says something about topics like gender, sexuality, climate change or evolution that annoys someone. You can\u2019t just pretend science is on your side when your understanding of science is based on a grade school textbook.","filename":"Bill_Nye_Saves_world_poster-1492470090","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":645,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":157,"tim":1493188736971,"time":1493188736,"md5":"mltW2sHke+vX9DzAHnTDLg==","fsize":110208,"resto":0,"id":"D5NGfWQQ","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"it-bothers-me-to-see-how-many-people-are-saying","country_name":"United States","replies":3,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":122854664,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)02:39:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"Also, why is it only gender people seem to have a problem with? Yeah, basic school textbooks will talk about XX and XY chromosomes and the male and female reproductive system, but they\u2019ll also talk about how humans have five fingers on each hand and how the eye works when everyone knows some humans are born with six fingers on each hand or born blind. Textbooks will talk about how our body metabolises fats, but nobody would say \u201clol no sorry science says otherwise\u201d at someone (like one of my secondary school classmates) who had a rare disorder who couldn\u2019t metabolise fats. We accept that sweeping statements about human biology are generalisations. Sure, there are limits - no humans have wings or feathers, that would go against science - but we all accept some level of human diversity outside the basic-level textbooks - diversity that\u2019s described well in the advanced medical textbooks. So why is it people only apply this logic to gender and not other differences in human biology?<br> <br>I think part of it could be the backlash against postmodern nonsense which suggests everything is opinion and science is no more objective than art, which is a blatantly anti-science attitude. But the idea that sex, gender and sexuality aren\u2019t totally binary isn\u2019t just postmodern gender theory, it\u2019s actual science with empirical evidence to back it up.","time":1493188765,"resto":122854622,"id":"D5NGfWQQ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122854752,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)02:40:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122854622\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122854622<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;muh 720000 genders is science tho<\/span><br><br>lol no it isn&#039;t.

Hopefully you get it. Your civilian education does not increase your chances of getting an MOS. The only criteria is that if the MOS is open. The only career fields that are directly based on your college education are Chaplains, Lawyers, and Medical Officers. <br>Even then you wouldn&#039;t be a gunsmith unless you are selected for your branch&#039;s precision rifle program and again, education doesn&#039;t mean shit. Open billets and being able to move to that billet determines that. The odds of you being a no-shit gunsmith are pretty fucking slim. Canadian armorers have a decent chance of doing it though. My friend is some kind of Warrant officer in the Canadian Forces and in his MOS training he was allowed to bring in his personal rifle for gunsmithing techniques like chequering and such.","time":1490923884,"resto":118998498,"id":"vUYl5EC8","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119000288,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)21:32:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118998498\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118998498<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;university degree<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;familiarity with weapons<\/span><br>Yes.

It seems nearly all the people around me have fallen mentally ill. People are unable to contribute helpful ideas or defend freedoms they love so much... <br><br>I just got done practicing at a local shooting range. I walk out to the lobby and the newest Paris attacks were on TV. One of the workers there, gun advocate and gun nut to the extreme. I jokingly said, &quot;Yea, probably has nothing to do with religion&quot;. He looked at me and told me, &quot;Yea, they just yell Allahu Akbar to get on T.V&quot;. <br><br>I don&#039;t quite get it.. Has this parasitized everybody in California? Does ANYBODY take what other people say seriously anymore? <br><br>From a religion that says over and over what they are doing and why they are doing it.. Is it normal for people to just completely ignore what other people say are the motives for their actions? <br><br>I feel so alone here... Mindless zombies inhabit this state, I wish anybody here a pleasant death when the next Muslim attack comes. They are welcoming, helping and ignoring everything they shoulden&#039;t and allowing it to flourish. All for social brownie points or fear from backlash of what they say. Not a SINGLE FUCKING PERSON HERE will ever stand up for something they believe in. <br><br>From moms abusing kids in public to people shooting others in the name of a child rapist, they all deserve what will surely come if this continues.","filename":"DOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOMMMMMMMMMMMMMEEEEEEEEEEEEEDDDDDDDDDDDDD","ext":".jpg","w":490,"h":365,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":186,"tim":1492862189790,"time":1492862189,"md5":"h3tzXj5Jcsix66Uc9qBebg==","fsize":71621,"resto":0,"id":"wEKIjyXl","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"were-fucked","country_name":"United States","replies":16,"images":0,"unique_ips":8},{"no":122269392,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)07:58:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"He replied sarcastically to your sarcastic remark.

What we need to do to convert the masses to our cause is simply expose them to their own culture. What culturam marxists have succeeded in doing in the past century is not disprove the worth of Western culture, but hide it. <br><br>As Bowden said, &quot;you have to know about our own forms to be able to deny the postulation of these people who would deny them.

Look at what we\u2019ve produced as a group.&quot;<br><br>Expose yourself to to the glories of the West and share them with as many normies as you can.

There are three parts to making a game I&#039;ll only really go into detail about the third one as the other two are hard to explain.<br><br>The first is the idea of the game. A simple way to think about this might be in a games lore or world building. That&#039;s not entirely accurate as you wouldn&#039;t look for a story in say a racing game. This while isn&#039;t the least important it&#039;s the one thing anyone can do and as such is seen as worthless. Best way to put it would be the games setting.<br><br>The second is game mechanics. This everything from leveling systems to game controls. Figuring out what good game mechanics comes from trial and error as well as studying other games in the medium. If you need help figuring out how to do this look up how film students analyze film techniques to see what makes a more engaging film. While different there is some overlap.<br><br>The big one is knowing the tools to make the game. Programing will be your best friend and the most useful tool. I would start with C and then learn C++ or C#. You wont use C to make games but you will learn a lot more by starting there. Check out the \/g\/ wiki for programing books. Then you need to figure out what engine you want to use if any. This depends on what type of game it is and if it&#039;s 2D\/3D but the big ones are Unity and Unreal. I&#039;m a fan of Unreal myself and depending on what engine you go with will dictate what language you should learn after C. <br><br>The you need to make the assets of a game. Art direction is very important when making them as it can make all the difference in the world. By this I mean visually games have two components. Aesthetic and graphics. Let&#039;s take The Legend of Zelda Wind Waker and Crisis. Graphically Crisis kicks WW&#039;s ass in every category from polygon count to lighting. However Wind Waker ages better due to using cell shading to mask that. That&#039;s what I would call aesthetic or atmosphere. Graphics are important but you need to have a 1\/2","filename":"43t43t","ext":".png","w":480,"h":620,"tn_w":96,"tn_h":124,"tim":1491960908270,"time":1491960908,"md5":"3GHeJJ4LI08ngn5Kh9QOCw==","fsize":553929,"resto":120675686,"id":"\/Ii6lbr5","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120693022,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)21:35:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120692836\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120692836<\/a><br>Rockstar north my man.

Sometimes the best sound is the one you don&#039;t even know is there.<br><br>Sorry for the mess of a post but I have to run so I threw this together in a rush. One last bit of advice though. Give the player as many options in the menu as you can. This is a feature lacking from too many games and it makes all the difference when you cab adjust sound options individually.

In their worldview, they&#039;re engaged in a titanic battle of good and evil, as determined by how much of the groupthink you&#039;ve swallowed.

They constantly try to one-up one another by virtue signalling just how much they believe in their opinions. Those who believe the hardest and can show it off are the best people. This effect has been snowballing for sixty years and at this point it&#039;s reached the level of nearly collapsing our entire civilization.

That&#039;s not really what we do. It&#039;s complicated and there&#039;s a lot to it, but on the one hand there&#039;s film analysis that we have inhereted from the French Cahiers de Cinema, and the nouvelle vague style. Basically it just means applying the techniques of literary analysis (originally as it existed in Parisian cafe culture) to movies. <br><br>But on another level, we do deeply and repeatedly study techniques of some films. Blocking, Mise en Scene, shot composition, camera placement, and lighting schemes are things that you absolutely can (and should) steal from better film makers than you. One of my favorites is the election scene from Citizen Kane.<br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=kzw<wbr>wr1Rgt2Y<br><br>Look at how low angle the camera is. Orson Welles literally had to cut a hole in the floor to get it down low enough. Watch how the characters upstage one another by moving closer and further away from the camera. Joseph Cotton is much shorter than Orson Welles in real life. But by upstaging him, he appears to be the same height to the camera. This is manipulation of 2d space. It&#039;s done to communicate power dynamics in a very post-modernist, Foucault way. Hitchcock said that the characters height in frame should always be directly proportional to how important he is in the scene. But Welles used relative size to communicate aggression. These men are struggling. Sometimes Cotton stands up to Welles, sometimes he retreats. This is shown by how large the characters appear to be, which changes based on how they toward and away from the camera.","time":1491961545,"resto":120675686,"id":"h9cp9mCG","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120694494,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)21:45:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"This thread is cancer and makes me sick.

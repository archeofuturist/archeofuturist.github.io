In the propaganda that went on in the early days of the Greek crisis, all unpopular and ethically suspect measures that were required were attributed to the IMF (e.g. everything pension-fund related). It was obvious that the IMF was there to just take the blame, so that nobody could say that the Germans asked us to cut pensions\/increase the age of retirement. Generally, a lot of measures taken were in conflict with the Greek Constitution, and all sides partaking in the negotiation put the blame on IMF.<br><br>In short, IMF is very comfy for globalists. Whenever they do something nobody likes, they blame the IMF. It is like an entity inspired by a Kafka book.","time":1492565876,"resto":121776623,"id":"yGkbIU+\/","country":"GR","country_name":"Greece"}]}

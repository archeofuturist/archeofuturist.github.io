According to an article published in 1995 in Neuroscience &amp; Biobehavioral Reviews, schizophrenics have much higher smoking rates than people with other mental illnesses, and appear to use it as a method of self-medicating. The article postulates that nicotine found in cigarettes reduces psychiatric, cognitive, sensory, and physical effects of schizophrenia, and also provides relief of common side effects from antipsychotic drugs. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The treatment of schizophrenia isn&#039;t the only positive effect that nicotine has on the brain. A series of very interesting studies from multiple academic sources confirms that the risk of Parkinson&#039;s disease and Alzheimer&#039;s disease is surprisingly higher in non-smokers than in smokers. Doctor Laura Fratiglioni of Huddinge University Hospital in Sweden states, &quot;Cigarette smokers are 50% less likely to have PD or AD than are age and gender-matched nonsmokers [...] cigarette smoking exerts an undefined, biologic, neuroprotective influence against the development of PD and AD.&quot; <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The University of Melbourne confirmed the claims made by many smokers that tobacco itself is a strong appetite suppressant, and many use it to self-treat compulsive overeating disorders or obesity. Many smokers experience weight loss and decreased appetite after they begin smoking, and the Melbourne study found similar results in lab rats and mice exposed to cigarette smoke. While tobacco-influenced pharmaceuticals may at some point be an available option to treat obesity, smoking as a self-treatment is very ill-advised, since the negative effects of tobacco and obesity tend to compound and create interrelated conditions.<\/span>","time":1490897051,"resto":118932614,"id":"Rtp4eZK0","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118947411,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)14:06:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118932614\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118932614<\/a><br>5 years plus whatever else you are doing to fuck over your body<br><br>you&#039;ll live a lot less longer if you have other problems along with being a smoker","time":1490897170,"resto":118932614,"id":"klO+KILT","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118947485,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)14:06:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118932836\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118932836<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;And?

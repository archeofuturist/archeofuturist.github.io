If you pump oxygen into the air, will we get a population increase with larger, better people? Also, if 10k pounds of CO2 was released into the atmosphere, only about 1k pounds would affect land. The rest goes into ocean where it does fuck all except kill shell fish and coral. And even if we get healthier plants that grow faster, that doesn&#039;t mean a goddamn thing to help soil and nutrients loss, which will fuck us over faster than any global warming.<br><br>t. farmer","time":1490517294,"resto":118336266,"id":"vavUAKio","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118339326,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)04:35:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118338742\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118338742<\/a>","filename":"1929597362291","ext":".png","w":1440,"h":1988,"tn_w":90,"tn_h":124,"tim":1490517310830,"time":1490517310,"md5":"kN5WWh3aNUMHYEi9SPlJjA==","fsize":359990,"resto":118336266,"id":"Gk2nX19C","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":118339382,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)04:35:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118338166\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118338166<\/a><br>Good goy.

The second women got the vote in less than 20-30 years you had a welfare state in every single country where they got the vote. The shifted voting pattern so drastically you went into the worst aspects of socialism within a single generation. Then they forced the state to let them into the workforce en mass which meant that not only were male wages depressed by 40-50% making it harder for them to get married and start a family but also now women have disposable income and are no longer dependent on marriage which meant they could go to the city and rent their own apartment and be a whore that fucks everything on two legs were as before mass female employment any such woman would be a prostitute and living in poverty.<br><br>And even that wasnt enough. They further demanded money from the state&#039;s tax funds (majority of which are paid by men, women pay very low taxes) to finance their degeneracy when they fuck random men and have bastard children. <br><br>The entire system is dysgenic and rewards the worst people who engage in the worst behavior while punishing the best people who engage in the best behavior. <br><br>If you are honest and moral and work your ass off you will be lucky to afford to marry and have 1-2 kids. Meanwhile Tyrone can deal drugs (income off the book so cannot be levied or taxed) and fuck 4-5 negressess have 2-3 kids each and skip town. He can propagate his genetics by a factor of 5X or even 10X without working at all and the normal honest family man literally pays taxes that go to feeding and housing his niglet spawn. <br><br>This cannot continue anymore. Some will break.

Most wrote of a &quot;national socialism&quot; in which they emphasized the &quot;new spirit&quot; in Germany that was both &quot;national&quot; and &quot;social&quot;. They denounced the French Revolution and Chartism for having created &quot;mammonism, selfishness, and forgetfulness of obligations&quot; and for these being a &quot;eudenmonistic utilitarian philosophy&quot;. Instead they said that these should be replaced by &quot;pragmatism&quot;, &quot;faith&quot;, and &quot;social interest&quot;.<br><br>While we have very much in common with National Socialism, especially Strasserism, this is NOT national socialism. It DID SIGNIFICANTLY INFLUENCE Hitler and others, but it is a distinct third-way philosophy. <br><br>Essentially, it is National Socialism for those who disagree with ideas of enforced hierarchy in general, but who still believe some must have unquestionable authority, like a leader or monarch.","filename":"xixDfZd","ext":".png","w":3827,"h":2551,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1492106241826,"time":1492106241,"md5":"znma5dz+O5suNVH0679oPQ==","fsize":670904,"resto":0,"id":"KK7SzFB1","country":"GB","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"this-is-for-the-discussion-of-a-number-of","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":4,"images":0,"unique_ips":4},{"no":120939048,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)13:59:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"Kill yourself.","time":1492106398,"resto":120938673,"id":"xmOpKTaa","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120939148,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)14:00:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120939048\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120939048<\/a><br>no, u","time":1492106444,"resto":120938673,"id":"KK7SzFB1","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120940788,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)14:13:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"Bump for interest","time":1492107203,"resto":120938673,"id":"zD01\/OCg","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120942101,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)14:23:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"Bump (I&#039;m cooking, and will reply very soon)","time":1492107796,"resto":120938673,"id":"x2TYC6Su","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]}

Humor is often based on controversy and challenging the status quo, which means that moralizing zealots that make up the establishment are incapable of being funny or self-aware, and end up being the butt of every joke. Back in the day, it was the Christian conservatives who were made fun of for being rigid, humorless and moralizing, while the liberal comedians were accused of being immoral and godless. Today the roles have been reversed.

They enjoyed everything from curry night to such traditional Royal Navy dishes as hammy eggy cheesy, toast layered with shredded ham, an egg and covered with melted cheese and kippered herrings along with eggs, bacon and beans for breakfast, or haggis and bashed neeps (mashed turnips) for dinner. The ship even features &quot;Chips at Six&quot;, fresh french fries served in the bar before dinner.<br><br>Other pluses? A roomy, teak quarterdeck aft to take a quiet break or take in a sunset, beautifully varnished wooden ladders and generous carpeting (which are stripped when the ship goes into battle) and Internet connectivity that works every time.<br>But one of the most satisfying things is that the ship is a strike carrier where Harriers, not helicopters, are the priority.<br>This is the Royal Navy&#039;s A team, and they live and breathe strike, said Col. Eric &#039;Beans&#039; Van Camp, the commanding officer of Marine Aircraft Group 14, who also commanded the U.S. air group aboard Illustrious. On a gator, the Harriers are secondary to the amphibious and helicopter mission.<br>(cont1\/4)","time":1491339249,"resto":119513382,"id":"wsMRotLW","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119514989,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)16:54:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119514433\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119514433<\/a><br>apparently the HR rep is there in a neutral capacity and just there to oversee the meeting is fair for all parties<br><br><a href=\"#p119514504\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119514504<\/a><br><a href=\"#p119514608\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119514608<\/a><br>employers trying to enforce me to complete the remaining work of my apprenticeship in 5 months. contract won&#039;t be renewed in september due to financial reasons. i have 18 months left of work to do, around 75% of my qualification. did have until september 2018 to complete apprenticeship","time":1491339261,"resto":119513382,"id":"+1oJVBkQ","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119515001,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)16:54:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119513382\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119513382<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;A<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;FUCKING<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;RAMP<\/span>","time":1491339268,"resto":119513382,"id":"JhNCbZCM","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119515024,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)16:54:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"GET OUT OF MY TERRITORIAL WATERS<br>REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE","filename":"REEEEEEEEEEEE","ext":".png","w":635,"h":248,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":48,"tim":1491339277310,"time":1491339277,"md5":"+c3khzz+mKqqSxRH3Qc8Qg==","fsize":389216,"resto":119513382,"id":"ClnweGpj","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119515036,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)16:54:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119514791\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119514791<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Jeremy Corbyn ended a frosty interview with LBC and insisted we stopped recording after objecting to a question about his future.<\/span><br><br>kek he sounds like a tired old granddad thats just walked back from the shops","time":1491339281,"resto":119513382,"id":"yrrdKw8I","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119515037,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)16:54:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119514926\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119514926<\/a><br>Uh..

As an officer, your job is to lead, and if you need to talk to the captain all the time, then you&#039;re not doing your job or letting him do his.<br><br>Another philosophical difference is that the British are open to ideas that to Americans seem goofy, but work, such as the 12-degree ramp at the bow of the ship that dramatically improves Harrier operations. Senior U.S. naval officers over the decades have vetoed the idea, saying they don&#039;t like how it looks and that it takes up three helicopter landing spots. British and Marine officers say only one deck spot is lost to the &#039;ski jump.<br><br>To a man, Marine pilots want the ramps installed on their ships to improve operational flexibility and safety.<br><br>We&#039;re all in love with the ski ramp because when you come off that ramp, you&#039;re flying, Bradicich said. From our ships, if you&#039;re fully loaded, you need 750 feet, and even then you&#039;ve got some sink once you clear the deck. Here, you can do the same thing in 450 feet and you&#039;re climbing.<br><br>But the ramp is intimidating at first sight, pilots said.<br><br>I expected it to be violent, but when you take off, it&#039;s almost a non-event, said Maj. Grant &#039;Postal&#039; Pennington, a pilot with VMA-513 at Marine Corps Air Station Yuma, Ariz. Up you go, and you&#039;re climbing. It&#039;s a great experience.<br><br>Equally important is the ship that&#039;s bolted to the ramp, pilots said.<br><br>Some of our guys who haven&#039;t flown from our ships yet are in for a big surprise when they do. This is probably the best ship you could possibly fly a Harrier from. Its not very big, but it&#039;s really stable, no roll, just a little pitch, not like the flat-bottom gators that roll so much. Youve got the island moving 30 feet in each direction when you&#039;re trying to land.

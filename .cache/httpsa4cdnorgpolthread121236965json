The Marine responded, &quot;I&#039;m sorry, sir, but Hillary Clinton is not the president.\u201d The elderly man turned and left, but came back the very next day and again approached the same Marine. Once more, the man requested to see President Hillary Clinton. And, as before, the Marine replied, &quot;Sir, Hillary Clinton is not the president.&quot; This continued yet again the following day when the man appeared once more with the same exact question. The Marine, now annoyed with the old man, stated bluntly, &quot;Sir, I kindly informed you yesterday and the day before that Hillary Clinton is not the president. Don&#039;t you understand?&quot; In turn, the elderly gentleman began to smile, &quot;Oh, I understand. It&#039;s just that it&#039;s so good to hear you say it.&quot; Beaming with pride, the Marine snapped to a salute, &quot;Yes, sir! See you tomorrow, sir!&quot;","filename":"Luke_Crywalker[1]","ext":".png","w":565,"h":492,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":217,"tim":1492278984141,"time":1492278984,"md5":"QFrXupQhRCua64SpC+otjQ==","fsize":622094,"resto":0,"id":"39vUmfPK","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"on-the-day-after-trumps-inauguration-an-elderly","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":1,"unique_ips":2},{"no":121237135,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)13:57:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121236965\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121236965<\/a>","filename":"i get it","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":360,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":90,"tim":1492279072412,"time":1492279072,"md5":"\/LA3nlEQYW573LZEK3RBpg==","fsize":23858,"resto":121236965,"id":"kihK9fAK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

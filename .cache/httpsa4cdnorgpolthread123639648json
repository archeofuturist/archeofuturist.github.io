Times were really shitty back then, but man the music was amazing and had this attitude to it with Emo and Screamo bands along with Nine Inch Nails. It really spoke about how horrible everything was with the lyrics and had meaning compared to today&#039;s sold out viral garbage. Especially when there was 2 wars going on, social media became a thing thanks to Myspace. Before Facebook was able to convince everyone to Jew their friends to the platform making the awful SJW internet shit we have today. Before that there was Newgrounds which is still the flash artistry of Pol that did not give a fuck about what was animated or said. <br><br>But I am not dumb enough to think 2017 was shit in general. I mean look at what we have now compared to back then, we have pornhub, Netflix, Spotify and Smart phones instead of those slider phones back in the old days that would break and you could not access YouTube or even have apps or tablets you can watch porn on a portable device which was not possible in 2006. Fuck even Computers for 800$ can last you a good 10 years than they use to. <br><br>The unfortunate thing is we need to get back to a time when people can express themselves without getting so much shit over it in regards to advertising pulling funding etc and SJW&#039;s throwing a fit.

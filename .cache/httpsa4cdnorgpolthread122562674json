What are your thoughts?<br><br>Here is my assessment: World wars happen when major powers seek to grow in a world which has no room. Russia and China are the two main powers whose growth is being limited by NATO and its allies. This is why Putin wants to influence elections in France and the United States. If he can divide Europe and weaken the Euro, he can, by proxy, increase Russia&#039;s relative economic and diplomatic clout. China is a rapidly emerging superpower with similar interests, but is currently being held in check by the United States and its allies. Both nations have expressed interest in greatly enhancing their military capacities as a form of recourse for their economic woes. If they cannot win the economic game, it is likely that they will begin to become more aggressive to increase their negotiating power. It is my estimation that we are witnessing the beginning stages of this, and that it will culminate in a third world war. As the world becomes more and more isolationist, the greater the tensions.","filename":"wwiii","ext":".jpg","w":1600,"h":900,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1493022117012,"time":1493022117,"md5":"pya4zZ\/Qng8zV78J6z0ekA==","fsize":373618,"resto":0,"id":"3ve2ndv\/","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"is-there-actually-any-chance-that-we-are-heading","country_name":"United States","replies":16,"images":0,"unique_ips":9},{"no":122562774,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)04:23:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122562674\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122562674<\/a><br>25th April - NK military anniversary + NYC false flag nuke attack<br>literally WW3 in a few hours and youre questioning it all now.","time":1493022193,"resto":122562674,"id":"GEl89diE","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":122562901,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)04:24:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122562774\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122562774<\/a><br>That&#039;s complete tinfoil hat bullshit","time":1493022297,"resto":122562674,"id":"L4FaUpUA","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122563015,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)04:26:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122562774\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122562774<\/a><br>I don&#039;t know that it would be that abrupt, but I think that the next few years could be quite interesting.","time":1493022393,"resto":122562674,"id":"3ve2ndv\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122563050,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)04:26:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"Probably just wind up with Cold War 2:electric boogaloo starring proxy battles like N.Korea and Syria","time":1493022419,"resto":122562674,"id":"23UdPfSK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122563061,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)04:27:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122562901\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122562901<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;is this what you said on Sep 10th &#039;01 anon?<\/span>","time":1493022428,"resto":122562674,"id":"GEl89diE","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":122563108,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)04:27:46","name":"Anonymous","com":".","time":1493022466,"resto":122562674,"id":"EaCZ9RGJ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122563235,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)04:29:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122563050\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122563050<\/a><br>NK would only entertain a total war scenario.

If your proposal makes sense you should be able to describe it better than &quot;ur so linear man thats y u dont get it&quot;<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Hence why it appears you can keep on making infinite large sets because you are stuck in the linear perspective.<\/span><br>Even if your critique of physics being to &quot;linear&quot; to account for your fucked up version of time made sense...you can&#039;t reuse the argument here because the cardinal numbers don&#039;t arise out of physical theory, they arise from axiomatic set theory (a branch of logic). <br><br>Suppose we had a collection of objects, call this collection X. Now take a picture of every smaller collection of objects in X. So if X was {1,2,3} we would have pictures of {1}, {2}, {3}, {1,2}, {1,3} etc<br><br>The number of pictures is always bigger than X. If you can accept this logic it follows that there is no largest infinity.","time":1491349739,"resto":119520113,"id":"PRLyXSgd","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119536739,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)19:53:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119528752\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119528752<\/a><br>dawkins is literally an athiest<br><br>none of the thiests in this thread have provided any worthwhile claims, what a shocker.","time":1491349999,"resto":119520113,"id":"EHErHfNI","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119537458,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)19:58:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119535725\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119535725<\/a><br><br>Dont forget to subscribe then<br><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/OO_TNdWrAhU?list=P<wbr>L5Jwvp7lLheMeELLZB5j41pz1GWn-36i6","time":1491350337,"resto":119520113,"id":"c8y6pOG8","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119538261,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)20:06:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119536242\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119536242<\/a><br>You don&#039;t understand the argument at all. I am not saying there is a finite largest infinity. That is missing the point of everything I am trying to say. There is no way to conceptualize all that there is (that being infinite completeness that is God) because perception is finite. If it was infinite, there would BE no concept of causality as you have been mentioning.

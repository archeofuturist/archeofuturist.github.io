On March 21st, 2016 in a meeting with the Washington Post he said this: &quot;I think our biggest form of climate change we should worry about is nuclear weapons.&quot; I think this is why North Korea has gone for so long pulling their shit and why others would send them aid whenever they tested. On top of holding Seoul hostage, they had the whole world hostage.<br><br>Transcript: &quot;FRED HIATT, WASHINGTON POST EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR: You think climate change is a real thing? Is there human-caused climate change?<br><br>DONALD TRUMP: I think there\u2019s a change in weather. I am not a great believer in man-made climate change. I\u2019m not a great believer. There is certainly a change in weather that goes \u2013 if you look, they had global cooling in the 1920s and now they have global warming, although now they don\u2019t know if they have global warming. They call it all sorts of different things; now they\u2019re using \u201cextreme weather\u201d I guess more than any other phrase. I am not \u2013 I know it hurts me with this room, and I know it\u2019s probably a killer with this room \u2013 but I am not a believer. Perhaps there\u2019s a minor effect, but I\u2019m not a big believer in man-made climate change.<br><br>STEPHEN STROMBERG, EDITORIAL WRITER: Don\u2019t good businessmen hedge against risks, not ignore them?<br><br>DONALD TRUMP: Well I just think we have much bigger risks. I mean I think we have militarily tremendous risks. I think we\u2019re in tremendous peril. I think our biggest form of climate change we should worry about is nuclear weapons. The biggest risk to the world, to me \u2013 I know President Obama thought it was climate change \u2013 to me the biggest risk is nuclear weapons. That\u2019s \u2013 that is climate change. That is a disaster, and we don\u2019t even know where the nuclear weapons are right now. We don\u2019t know who has them. We don\u2019t know who\u2019s trying to get them. The biggest risk for this world and this country is nuclear weapons, the power of nuclear weapons.&quot;","filename":"hqdefault","ext":".jpg","w":480,"h":360,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1492500088813,"time":1492500088,"md5":"YaJ0taBA+FKAVC3nqhJJ5A==","fsize":12503,"resto":0,"id":"0fygVn9N","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"north-korea-holds-the-world-hostage-with-nuke","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":1},{"no":121654100,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)03:25:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"Bump","time":1492500343,"resto":121653878,"id":"0fygVn9N","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

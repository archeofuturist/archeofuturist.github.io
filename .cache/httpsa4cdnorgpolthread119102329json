It is a religion of force; of promises and threats. I know most faiths, if not all, have concepts of heaven and hell, punishments and rewards. However, no religion focuses so much on the risk\/reward aspect as much as Christianity, or all 3 of the Abrahamic faiths in general. That is why it has spread so far and lasted so long; it is the ultimate form of control. To control someone&#039;s fear of pain (eternal punishment in the form of Hell) and love of pleasure (eternal Paradise in the form of Heaven) in such a way explains why so many peoples have converted. <br><br>Not to say there aren&#039;t plenty of good values to be taken from Christianity, though I don&#039;t believe those things are exclusive to the faith itself.

All you need is a thought, a catalyst, some basic understanding of how the human mind works and in a bit of time, presto, you can change the course of history with a strategic use of words. When you learn an idea that completely goes against everything that you once believed. A preconceived notion shattering, an idea that is too ludicrous or illogical, you as a conscious person, a person with a natural bias, an ego will treat the idea with skepticism or flat out dis-reject the idea on a conscious level. But its funny how the brain works. What you learn and choose to reject or not reject on a conscious level, will still end up getting absorbed by your subconscious mind irregardless of your selection, on an unconscious level to you. And within some time, albeit with a few weeks, a few months, that seed, that new idea, will eventually grow and take form till it eventually consumes your thinking and belief system. That idea that you completely forgot about and initially rejected, will have you consciously come to terms with it on your own accordance, believing you came up with the idea, or not, but what does hold objectively true is that you agree with the idea. You can call it subliminal marketing but instead of selling a product, your shifting the make up of society. With a bit of dedication, what you truly believe in can alter and change the ideas of thousands of men who will eventually shape up the ideas of millions of men, who will then go out and shape up the meta functioning of the society as a whole, and on a grandiloquent scale, the direction of where history is heading towards. Whenever your brain will make you realize a new idea, and what you believed you came onto on your own terms according to your ego, just know that the conclusion came to realization by the manipulation of forces outside of your understanding or perception.","time":1491003671,"resto":119102329,"id":"hsnEN1PI","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119115977,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)19:41:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119115217\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119115217<\/a><br>I dont take it as abuse of fear.<br>Is a child being afraid of its fathers wrath something bad?

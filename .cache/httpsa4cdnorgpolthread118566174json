Immigration eligibility should be based on merit - you must obtain a high level of education, have a high amount of assets, have a high income, and just in general prove that you&#039;ve been a well-adjusted and contributing member of society. Those who exemplify in these criteria will have priority. There should also be some absolute musts, ie.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;You must be able to speak, read and write the native language fluently<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;You must show a good deal of knowledge of the country&#039;s society and culture and what life in it is actually like<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;You must promise that you&#039;ll try to assimilate into the greater society (not living in an ethnic ghetto, etc.) and you will be monitored after arrival to ensure that you&#039;re following through on this promise.<\/span><br>As long as immigration is targeted towards and only towards these demographics, it can be monumentally beneficial for a country.<br>Also the major loophole around this, asylum, must be amended. In order to be considered for asylum you must prove that you personally are in severe and immediate danger of suffering political human rights abuses in the country that you live in, AND that no other country where you will be safe has agreed to take you in as a refugee.","filename":"images","ext":".jpg","w":225,"h":225,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490677597123,"time":1490677597,"md5":"w6SRXdsV2akPMmEATwGplw==","fsize":8547,"resto":118566174,"id":"tdjrtBLV","country":"IL","country_name":"Israel"},{"no":118613970,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)01:06:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118612975\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118612975<\/a><br><br>W Why do leftists look like they weren&#039;t breast fed or something?<br><br>Its disgusting.<br><br>Like they grew up eating canned horse dick or something.<br><br>Jesus fucking christ.","time":1490677615,"resto":118566174,"id":"uLBY3Vjj","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118614411,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)01:12:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"I believe in abortion rights up til the third term ( or brain function)","time":1490677939,"resto":118566174,"id":"l1iMqEOj","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118614555,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)01:14:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118613940\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118613940<\/a><br><br>This is some goy level shit kike.<br><br>The left is not concerned with quality immigration.

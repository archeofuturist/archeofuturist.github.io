Omniscience isn&#039;t limited to the present. God knows what sins we will commit before we commit them and punishes us knowing that our die was cast. The choice between good and evil, to sin or abstain hinges upon the assumption of free will. Even if the truth of the universe were one of branching timelines with infinite divergences brought on by one&#039;s choices then an omniscient God would still know what paths we would ultimately follow.<br><br>I am really not trying to shit on your beliefs. I am an uneasy agnostic. I want there to be meaning to the universe and not cold, apathetic randomness. I want there to be an afterlife. I want there to be a God, but I cannot rationalize the Biblical definition of God with the idea of free will. If God exists then he knows all our sins before we commit them, before we are ever born, yet he still allows us to be punished. That seems so cruel.","time":1493661798,"resto":123644906,"id":"qzGO9FqV","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

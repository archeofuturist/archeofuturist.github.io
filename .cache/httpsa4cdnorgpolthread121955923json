It almost sounded like a forced act and that it made me think he&#039;s an actor playing a lead role in a movie as Hitler. <br><br>Is he, dare I say it, CIA&#039;s guy?","filename":"123","ext":".jpg","w":563,"h":374,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1492664941395,"time":1492664941,"md5":"K36aoXFH3itG\/wgo8rXhxw==","fsize":26970,"resto":0,"id":"kkkeWoy7","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"just-saw-his-latest-speech-at-auburn-and-he","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":121956525,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)01:15:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121955923\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121955923<\/a><br>I was showing clips of him to someone today and the Al Jazeera interview he did was pretty good but when we saw a CNN clip from recently, my friend mentioned that he was repeating the same line and that his body language and smirks and stuff made him seem untrustworthy. I like the vast majority of what he says, but ya I don&#039;t really rust him. Also Depeche Mode is some seriously fag music I haven&#039;t listened to that shit since high school.","time":1492665309,"resto":121955923,"id":"r+svxdNx","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

Meaning that a 25 year old man must legally buy coverage, and that coverage must include cervical cancer screenings and pregnancy tests.Part 3: of the ACA is about creating &quot;Risk sharing pools&quot; which is basically just paper pushing on the part of the insurance companies. &quot;The obamacare exchanges&quot; so everyone who buys a plan from within the exchange, all the funds from those premiums and deductibles go into one collective bucket to pay for the insurance\/health needs of the people paying into those plans.

Better luck next time.<\/span><br><br>Socialism means different things to different socialistic movements. The core principle is reappropriation of the product of labor to those who provide th labor. There have been many socialist movements who have advocated &quot;socialism by degrees&quot; that is, rather than a hostile takeover of everything at once. Private ownership of the means of production is still allowed, however the product of that production is redistributed through taxes and government programs, having in the end the same effect as a state owned enterprise.","time":1493926272,"resto":124093573,"id":"tH3MLWhx","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124098507,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)15:32:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124093724\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124093724<\/a><br>Great now you guys can go without healthcare and still have higher prices.","time":1493926328,"resto":124093573,"id":"o\/4xRnrz","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124098597,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)15:32:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124093573\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124093573<\/a><br>taxation","time":1493926366,"resto":124093573,"id":"cp9DKwuS","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124098735,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)15:33:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124098507\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124098507<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;can go without healthcare<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;still have higher prices<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;Being this autistic<\/span>","time":1493926426,"resto":124093573,"id":"vu6G8RNI","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124098742,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)15:33:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124098200\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124098200<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;obamacare encourages competition<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;forcing everyone in the country to buy a product and forcing the seller of said product to eat losses instead of refusing to take bad deals encourages competition.<\/span><br><br>read the thread you mongoloid.

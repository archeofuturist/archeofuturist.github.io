I no longer believe that the Christian church is moral or just. I believe in God, a higher power, but organized religion is dead to me. All my life I&#039;ve always felt a calling to believe in a higher power, but Christ and Christians have left me feeling nothing but emptiness. I wouldn&#039;t put my faith in Islam or Judaism either. Both of them are as useless and full of shit as Mormonism and Joseph Smith to me. <br><br>Christianity is a Jewish invention for subversion. Nietzsche was correct, that Christianity is weak. It&#039;s a religion made for the stupid and weak so the strong don&#039;t crush them. <br><br>God values only strength.","filename":"99fc760e3947eef62f8d8993b8b2d5ae","ext":".jpg","w":478,"h":561,"tn_w":213,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491267148251,"time":1491267148,"md5":"hxaFeLwo7uAef2VeKeq1dA==","fsize":41599,"resto":0,"id":"aaGbdDYZ","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"disavowing-christ","country_name":"United States","replies":24,"images":6,"unique_ips":24},{"no":119407854,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)20:57:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119407291\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119407291<\/a><br><br>FAGGOT.

I no longer believe that the Christian church is moral or just. I believe in God, a higher power, but organized religion is dead to me. All my life I&#039;ve always felt a calling to believe in a higher power, but Christ and Christians have left me feeling nothing but emptiness. I wouldn&#039;t put my faith in Islam or Judaism either. Both of them are as useless and full of shit as Mormonism and Joseph Smith to me. <br><br>Christianity is a Jewish invention for subversion. Nietzsche was correct, that Christianity is weak. It&#039;s a religion made for the stupid and weak so the strong don&#039;t crush them. <br><br>God values only strength.","filename":"99fc760e3947eef62f8d8993b8b2d5ae","ext":".jpg","w":478,"h":561,"tn_w":213,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491267148251,"time":1491267148,"md5":"hxaFeLwo7uAef2VeKeq1dA==","fsize":41599,"resto":0,"id":"aaGbdDYZ","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"disavowing-christ","country_name":"United States","replies":6,"images":1,"unique_ips":7},{"no":119407854,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)20:57:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119407291\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119407291<\/a><br><br>FAGGOT.

You are turning your back on &quot;the church&quot;; whatever that is. I get it. You are disheartened by the turn the church made sometime around the late 1990s when everything went to media and showmanship on the pulpit. <br><br>Disavowing Christ is something else entirely. Saying that is the same as saying he bore no influence on your character at all. That the parables are all incorrect, and lacking true wisdom. <br><br>Do what I do, and read the bible. Just the parts in red - minus Revelations. Eschatology doesn&#039;t really help you in day-to-day; unless you get off on God killing (almost) everyone... twice.","time":1491267839,"resto":119407291,"id":"AdbrLWkJ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119408700,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)21:05:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119407291\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119407291<\/a><br>Find the true strength in yourself.","time":1491267920,"resto":119407291,"id":"0OZB\/2Pr","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119408718,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)21:05:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"did you feel... euphoric after making this post?","filename":"1451358756801","ext":".jpg","w":221,"h":246,"tn_w":112,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491267932332,"time":1491267932,"md5":"TRR\/I0jSPcDtBnkePJxwfw==","fsize":36451,"resto":119407291,"id":"AXOmbiUD","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":119408976,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)21:07:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"KYS","time":1491268060,"resto":119407291,"id":"ybEaficF","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119409396,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)21:11:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119407291\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119407291<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;If we died with him, we will also live with him;<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;if we endure, we will also reign with him.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;If we disown him, he will also disown us;<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;if we are faithless, he remains faithful, for he cannot disown himself.<\/span>","time":1491268289,"resto":119407291,"id":"gOj10t\/d","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

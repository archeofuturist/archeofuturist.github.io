They simply weren&#039;t listed in the deal, which is interesting and unusual for that much of a large company to be undisclosed.<br><br>Coincidentally, the Steele dossier states that 19% of Rosneft was given to Carter Page and his associates, as a brokerage fee, under the agreement that he would help lift US sanctions.<br><br>It states that 0.5% was given to Donald Trump, in exchange for softening the GOP stance on Ukraine, and of course, allowing the lifting of sanctions. They would also give him the presidency obviously, which makes the whole thing work.<br><br>As you might be aware, the GOP position on Ukraine officially softened. And the sanctions are officially in the process of being lifted. Some already are.<br><br>Now you can deny the dossier, you can deny the Russian involvement, but can you still deny the fact that numbers from the dossier matched numbers from the sale, which weren&#039;t released until after the dossier was known to exist? Can you deny that it&#039;s peculiar that the exchange for those numbers have actually occurred from Trump&#039;s people?<br><br>This is happening, folks.","filename":"Three-accused-of-QR30mn-theft-from-an-oil-company","ext":".png","w":750,"h":380,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":126,"tim":1490589433713,"time":1490589433,"md5":"kCALKrEPRFHQsHWJyzLirw==","fsize":392517,"resto":0,"id":"Tw3KPgOF","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"so-you-can-look-this-up-its-public-information","country_name":"United States","replies":3,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":118472697,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)00:45:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118471910\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118471910<\/a><br>https:\/\/www.rosneft.com\/press\/relea<wbr>ses\/item\/185049\/","time":1490589925,"resto":118471910,"id":"C\/VXYTYM","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":118473147,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)00:49:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118472697\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118472697<\/a><br>The privatization deal was funded by Gazprombank, whose parent company is the state-owned Russian energy giant Gazprom.<br><br>Carter Page holds investments in Gazprom.","time":1490590192,"resto":118471910,"id":"Tw3KPgOF","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118474057,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)00:59:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118473147\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118473147<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;sold to unknown parties<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;They simply weren&#039;t listed in the deal<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Gazprom<\/span><br>Are you retarded?

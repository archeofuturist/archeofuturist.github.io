Women should not be allowed in the work place with other males unless the work place segregates females from males.

If the woman can&#039;t support them then the father has full custody. <br>6. Reinstate miscegenation laws while grandfathering in those already mixed race couples already married.

My grandmother married a good man, had six kinds in married student housing. Took a job in teaching when her kids were old enough to go to school. In later life she taught college kids the Cobalt programming language. She made herself a badass pottery room with a kiln with her own earnings. They give all their 40 grand kids 1000 dollars every new years Of the interest of their investments.","time":1491020626,"resto":119133264,"id":"BXzuEALS","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119143642,"now":"04\/01\/17(Sat)00:24:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119143400\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119143400<\/a><br>You are reading the chart wrong and so did op. 48% of men prefer stay at home and 26% women prefer stay at home.<br>The chart tracks if you \/disagree\/ with the question","time":1491020698,"resto":119133264,"id":"vOgTO1kh","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119143751,"now":"04\/01\/17(Sat)00:25:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119143642\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119143642<\/a><br>Welp, time to kill myself.","time":1491020759,"resto":119133264,"id":"KPD+ajL1","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119143825,"now":"04\/01\/17(Sat)00:26:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119143430\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119143430<\/a><br>While I agree with most of this, this stuff is way too extreme right now.

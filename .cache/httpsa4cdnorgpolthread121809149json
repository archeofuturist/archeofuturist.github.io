They are &quot;the gods&quot; of antiquity and could even considered our creator via genetic splicing of apes DNAand their own DNA to create man. <br><br>Or<br><br>2) There is no space, there is no other planets, there is just this plane of existence that we call earth. The Bible and other ancient religious texts got it right. It&#039;s flat (not round) and all life is contained here. The human experience in itself is nothing more than the greater consciousness experiencing itself in 3dimensional form. We are the gods as we are the observers of matter\/particles that act for us. <br><br><br>I like 1 better honestly","time":1492581565,"resto":121809149,"id":"d3vub6Gv","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

The Allies were either a) ahead in everything else or b) decided it&#039;s not worthwhile investing in relative to other choices at their disposal. They were monitoring through spies the progress of the rocket program right up to the V2 rocket program for over a decade and all the Allied nations decided jet engines were too experimental so they focused on working designs. <br><br>3) The V2 rockets were a meme, they killed more factory workers than british and the program in itself was multitudes more costly than the Manhattan Project. It was objectively a useless thing for the war effort but Hitler thought it would win him the war<br><br>4) Wehrmacht tanks were shit. Worse than Shermans and T34 tanks by far. The wehrmacht would have been better of improving on the Panzer but instead they pumped out many prototypes of medium and heavy tanks and never focused on mass production and fine tuning. Panthers and Tigers were absolute shit, some of the worst functioning tanks of the war but Naziboos will try to tell you how awesome they were. Germans did train their tank crews a lot better though.<br><br>5) Soviet engineering was actually better. T34 tanks had light aluminium engines using diesel and the Germans attempted (and failed) to copy them). Copied other Soviet innovations like sloped armor. <br><br>6) The USSR didn&#039;t zerg rush or whatever nonsense. Actual combat casualties were closer to 1 German to 1.3 Soviet. It disparity in statistics comes from the amount of Soviet soldiers dying in POW camps.<br><br>7) Soviet battle doctrine was actually brilliant and the Germans were never able to adapt to deep battle doctrine.

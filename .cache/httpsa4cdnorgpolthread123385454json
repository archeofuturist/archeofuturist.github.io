It is morally wrong to advocate something dangerous while keeping silent of its danger. lgbt is morally wrong for the same reason advocating moving to Africa without warning of malaria or AIDS would be morally wrong. It&#039;s also a fact that the probability of cause increases with each correlation (See end of post for explanation).**** Drug abuse, alcohol abuse, anal cancer, AIDS, syphilus, hepatitis, pedophilia, mental illness, depression, and suicide are at least 10 things that correlate with lgbt (see citations).<br><br>Argument that lgbt, if allowed to exist as a movement indefinitely, will inevitably lead to things like acceptance of pedophilia, and ultimately the destruction of humanity:","filename":"Campaign_for_lgbtequality[1]","ext":".jpg","w":2400,"h":1056,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":110,"tim":1493501944309,"time":1493501944,"md5":"xBk79YwxgzTK\/gCtcoNUwg==","fsize":266455,"resto":0,"id":"aCOlnTpF","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"so-im-pretty-sure-ive-definitively-proven-lgbt-is","country_name":"United States","replies":5,"images":1,"unique_ips":2},{"no":123385486,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)17:39:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"&quot;Immoral,&quot; here, is defined as causing harm or suffering:<br>1.

Basically, the epistemic likelihood that lgbt is the cause of any of its distinct correlations, taking into account the epistemic possibility of an outside variable, is generally the number of possibilities of it being the cause of one correlation (number of correlations), over the number of possibilities of it being the cause of one correlation (number of correlations) plus the number of possibilities of it not being the cause of any correlation (1) plus the number of possibilities of not-it being the cause of every correlation (1) -- or the number of correlations, over the same number plus 2. So if p correlates with q, there is a 33% chance p causes q; if p correlates with q and r, and they don&#039;t correlate with each other, there is a 50% chance p causes q or r; if p correlates with q, r, and s, and they don&#039;t correlate with each other, there is a 60% chance p causes q, r, or s, etc. This is the same kind of logic that tells TV detectives that if someone was at multiple crime scenes, they&#039;re probably the killer.<br><br>If lgbt is correlated with drug abuse, alcohol abuse, anal cancer, AIDS, syphilus, hepatitis, pedophilia, mental illness, depression, and suicide, and none of these were correlated with each other, epistemically, there would be an 83% chance lgbt causes any of these, and a 16% chance it causes all of them. If we&#039;re charitable and say drug and alcohol abuse are correlated; AIDS, syphilus, and hepatitis are correlated; and mental illness, depression, and suicide are correlated, there is still a 71% chance lgbt causes any of these and a 3% chance it causes all of them.","time":1493501994,"resto":123385454,"id":"aCOlnTpF","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123385604,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)17:40:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"If it&#039;s possible at least three of the things correlated with lgbt aren&#039;t correlated with each other, then it&#039;s possible that it&#039;s probable lgbt causes some of them.

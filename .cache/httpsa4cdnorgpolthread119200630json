We originally set up rTD as a colony on reddit to spread propaganda and drum up support during the election. And in that regard, it was quite successful. Even though the kikes and marxists in charge of reddit censored the fuck out of rTD and morphed it into this cancerous milo-fellating &quot;civic nationalism, le BASED black trump supporters!&quot; fuckfest, it still served its purpose. But the downside is that these people have increasingly been flooding over to \/pol\/ and bringing us down to their level as well. An analogy I can think of is Britain colonizing India\/Pakistan and then later on the pakis and indians start flooding in reverse into Britain. <br><br>My only hope is that \/pol\/ assimilates and redpills these retarded redditfags and normies. Remember, \/pol\/ (and \/new\/ and \/n\/ before it) just started off as news boards. It was only through uncensored sharing of information and discussion that we eventually slid toward the realization of the jewish problem and turning toward national socialism and the like. Hopefully the same will eventually happen with the normalfags, but even if that is the case, it will still take quite some time for it to happen.","time":1491146049,"resto":119200630,"id":"0lGe1XWK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119208721,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)11:14:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119208448\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119208448<\/a><br>I can spot them a mile away mate.

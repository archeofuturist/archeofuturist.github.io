The era has shifted to more BVR fights with long range missiles, and the 35 has superior radar, stealth, and systems integration. Go look at the EOTS system of the f35 on youtube, it&#039;s fucking insane. It can look into a hotel room from ~50 nautical miles. The EO DAS system is amazing as well for communication between a flight or the commander. You can look THROUGH the airplane in nightvision. Hell you can shoot a missile at anything you see too, because you can shoot your missiles backwards (caveat: this burns a lot of fuel and it will have a much shorter range\/speed).<br><br>The integration of all the systems is god tier. Knowledge of the battlefield is incredibly useful. The system does almost everything for you. It&#039;s really quite amazing.<br><br>Having to deal with VTOL was shitty, but the military really trying to standardize all equipment - it hugely simplifies logistics. So if your in combat and something breaks, you can use parts from the A on the B or C model and not be hosed like if you had 7.62 ammo but only 5.56 chambered guns. Also massive pricetag is the program cost to 2050, so each unit ends up something like 120mil, which isn&#039;t that bad. Plus it&#039;ll get cheaper over time as more blocks come out.<br><br>Overall the rafale and eurofighter programs were about as bad if not a bit worse and those aren&#039;t even stealth fighters. It&#039;s still an expensive program, and I&#039;m sure execs at lockheed were pretty happy with it, but like all public knowledge programs, they use tech in black programs. We didn&#039;t know about the blackbird, nighthawk, or b-2 for awhile. And the tech from the glory that was the Comanche helicopter was used in the stealth blackhawks that were used against bin laden.

Starting with the question:<br><br>What should be done about gender dysphoria?<br><br>Depending on who you ask there is either no satisfactory treatment or treatment is easy as fuck. As a rule, hot button sociological studies tend to oversample people that confirm their biases. It really can&#039;t be determined for sure which are reliable and how reliable they are. That there are people who experience some sort of dissonance with their physical body is undeniable, however there&#039;s disagreement over causes and the level of concern that should be shown for the matter. However the question seems much more important now than in the past because medical science has advanced to a point where a reasonably feminine male can immitate a female phenotype. Which brings me to the second question.<br><br>What are the ethical implications of trapping?<br><br>It is essentially lying. You&#039;re presenting to propective mates that you&#039;re female and thus have a vagina and in principle procreation is a possibility. Even with full acceptance of physical and social transition this would still be a major issue. A trap will never be a real girl, so perhaps even if they can pass for one, is it unethical for them to even try?<br><br>And finally with ethics comes law. How should the law handle such people? Obviously they&#039;d like to be legally female, but they physically aren&#039;t. What approach should the state take to moderating the interactions of pseudo-females with persons who are unaware of their status? Should the state even take an approach at all?<br><br>What are your thoughts on the matter? As technology improves we&#039;ll only have more and more problems and questions like this in the future, and they&#039;re only going to get more and more strange. We might as well start thinking about it now before it becomes a larger problem.","filename":"anzukiss","ext":".webm","w":1280,"h":720,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1493747796336,"time":1493747796,"md5":"pB74WIzDiAs2G0xUHu9nqA==","fsize":943552,"resto":0,"id":"S+w06DpG","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"can-we-have-an-actual-political-discussion-about","country_name":"United States","replies":100,"images":33,"unique_ips":56,"tail_size":50},{"no":123795228,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)13:57:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"traps are the ultimate redpill","filename":"traps","ext":".png","w":1083,"h":1600,"tn_w":84,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493747869619,"time":1493747869,"md5":"znwY0hPqzYdn9+bQj2XiIg==","fsize":543522,"resto":123795089,"id":"KSNIKUlF","country":"ES","m_img":1,"country_name":"Spain"},{"no":123795515,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)14:00:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123795089\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123795089<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;be trans<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;be into girls<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;girls into that are thrilled to have a girlfriend with a dick they can fuck<\/span><br><br>Why do you frame this as traps loving and deceiving straight men when most are double faggots and into women?","time":1493748015,"resto":123795089,"id":"UsqWSbxB","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123795561,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)14:00:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"Anzu is a girl!","time":1493748031,"resto":123795089,"id":"p6IfjSVA","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123795727,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)14:01:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123795089\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123795089<\/a><br>Kill them","time":1493748101,"resto":123795089,"id":"wFjeZYMT","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123796026,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)14:04:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123795515\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123795515<\/a><br>I&#039;m reffering to straight(?) traps in specific but this principle still applies to females perhaps even doubly.

If people aren&#039;t notified in advance of such a thing it&#039;s essentially tricking someone into involuntary association. But on the other hand everone should own themselves if nothing else, and be able to decide their own destiny. As far as the genetics problem goes there is some research to suggest that there are some genetic predisposition factors to GD but like with most of these things there isn&#039;t enough work done to actually draw a conclusion. But lets say you have a transgender person that is open and forthcoming about their physical status. What if a family community wants to shield their children from such complexities of adult life. In this case, not infringing on someone&#039;s rights to know about you, infringes on someone else&#039;s rights to rais their children as they like. It seems to be an exceedingly complicated issue unless you start from the position that persons are not self sovereign and have no right to self determination.

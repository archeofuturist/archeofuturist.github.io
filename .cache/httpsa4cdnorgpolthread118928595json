Today that would be played up (Tarantino for example) but at the time Lucas was actually trying to hide it.<br><br>The reason people loved Star Wars was because they&#039;d seen it and liked it before they&#039;d ever seen it. Whether its Captain Blood, Laurence of Arabia, the Wizard of Oz, cowboy films, its all there. Being culturally western, you were pre-programmed for it even if you&#039;d never seen the original sources (because you&#039;d seen them parodied on the Muppet Show or already ripped into cartoons etc).<br><br>The tragedy is that Lucas hotwired your brain but didn&#039;t actually know how he&#039;d done it. It wasn&#039;t his creative genius, it was the process he&#039;d used to bootstrap it together. The mistake is what led to everything that followed.<br><br>This approach is probably most obvious in the scenes where he used war films as animatics and indeed showed the first cut with them still in. <br><br>Did you ever notice Wedge and Luke bickering about being able to see &quot;the tower&quot; didn&#039;t make much sense? <br><br>Thats because the &#039;tower&#039; in question was found on dams in the Ruhr valley and was used to judge the bomb release point in Operation Upkeep (aka &quot;The Dambusters&quot;), not on the Deathstar.

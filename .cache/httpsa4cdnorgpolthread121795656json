The short answer is nobody fucking knows. <br><br>The point of civilization itself though is just to further human life. That&#039;s it. <br><br>If all the world was suitable for small hunting\/gathering communities then there would be no need for civilization, and we can see this in African\/Amazonian tribes still stuck in the stone age. Except many of our ancestors found themselves having to form actual settlements and societies to survive. You simply couldn&#039;t make it in late-ice-age Eurasia unless you built permanent shelters to protect you and your family from the elements, and you couldn&#039;t maintain a permanent shelter without the collective support of other tribespeople. Scale that concept up from a tiny little group of yurts to a medieval farming village to a major industrial city and you can understand why most people live close to one another even today. <br><br>As \/pol\/-tier an answer as this might be Hitler really got it. The less unified your society is, the easier you&#039;ll be overrun by outside forces (whether this be invaders, natural forces, whatever). If everyone feels connected to and has some personal stake in the integrity of the group, however, you can multiply your problem-solving power by a factor of millions and thereby stay alive and propagate longer.","time":1492575927,"resto":121795656,"id":"Bdjp2kZW","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121800954,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)00:25:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121800669\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121800669<\/a><br>We don&#039;t use the Saturn V anymore, and new fuels are experimented with daily.

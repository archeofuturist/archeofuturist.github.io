Except many of our ancestors found themselves having to form actual settlements and societies to survive. You simply couldn&#039;t make it in late-ice-age Eurasia unless you built permanent shelters to protect you and your family from the elements, and you couldn&#039;t maintain a permanent shelter without the collective support of other tribespeople.

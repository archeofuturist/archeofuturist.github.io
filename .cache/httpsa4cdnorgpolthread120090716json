It looks like it was an orchestrated gas attack&quot;<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Assad<\/span><br>&quot;we didn&#039;t gas anyone wtf&quot;<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Russia<\/span><br>&quot;we attempted to bomb a FSA warehouse, it appears that this was storing chemical weapons&quot;<br><br>What most likely happened was that using Russian expertise the Syrian Air Force bombed an FSA warehouse, which then released the chemical weapons that were stored there. Assad is winning the war, he has nothing to gain from a gas attack on civilians, if a warehouse was the target, it seems obvious. To US intelligence, it would just look like SAA aircraft just gassed a bunch of innocents. Reports seem to suggestn there was a mixture of agents, some suffering from the affects of one type, some from the effects from another, this would suggest mixed chem weapons, sensible for a warehouse. Secondly, if this was a CHEMICAL ATTACK i would expect far greater causalities. Shit should be in the thousands I&#039;d expect, and why would they target an area with civilians?<br><br>It all points to a mistake (this is a Civil War after all), and a mistake that would easily look like an attack.","filename":"1467431642385","ext":".jpg","w":1920,"h":1080,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1491628274377,"time":1491628274,"md5":"Urxqaavpyc77j1Xklnkd4w==","fsize":242276,"resto":0,"id":"YWOOzWab","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"what-probably-happened-in-syria","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

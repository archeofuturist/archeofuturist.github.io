I&#039;d say that if our economy is solely down to the whims of the rich then we&#039;re being held hostage to some degree. If big business stop stuff like state spending, what is the point in having an election? Just run things by the rich people you speak of and let them decide. I&#039;d say it&#039;s a gamble worth making, especially seeing as countries like Greenland have shown it&#039;s possible to get rid of these shackles and still keep an economy stable. <br><br>That said I&#039;d have to do more research into it.

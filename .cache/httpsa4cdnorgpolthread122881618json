And it won\u2019t be UKIP and it won\u2019t be the Greens, even though there are good ideas which are Green and the idea of leaving the European Union (the UKIP option) is an attractive one that should be supported. But there is only really one option for this country and that is to vote for a party that is patriotic, which is British, which is elitist, which is nationalistic, which believes that the only socialism or the only social concern that really is validated by history, by genetics, by identity is patriotism.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Patriotism is the only thing that ties together people within the group in their difference and it aligns people together to overcome the breaches and divisions of class within our society.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The blue of social conservatism opposed in shorthand to everything UAF says that they stand for. The red of socio-economic concern particularly for people at the bottom of the prior economic pyramid. The Tories have no concern about such people at all. The Conservative definition of patriotism excludes half the population from the very beginning. We must bring the two classes together. We must bring the North and the South together. We must bring the red and the blue together. And if you look at the Union flag, there\u2019s plenty of white in the red, white, and blue.<\/span>","filename":"BowdenGesture","ext":".jpg","w":669,"h":540,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":100,"tim":1493215234629,"time":1493215234,"md5":"sMS5ampxj3NZRsCtqEMS0A==","fsize":67036,"resto":122881618,"id":"e0f9qwIs","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122886069,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)10:00:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122885551\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122885551<\/a><br><br>Your type will be locked up in the gas showers with the royals and the muslims when I win the election","time":1493215242,"resto":122881618,"id":"8cPNj1x0","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122886086,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)10:00:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122885429\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122885429<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;by the end of the century, British births will be majority nonwhite<\/span><br><br>Why end of the century and why pretend slavs are any better?

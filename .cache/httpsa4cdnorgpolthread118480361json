Especially when it&#039;s about white people. When I was an undergrad, my professor nonchalantly let it slip that white men dont have the same type of Y chromosome as the rest of the human race. When I pressed him further he realized his mistake and dismissed any further questions. Then he got really angry when I pressed the issue further. That emboldened me to discover what he meant. After many weeks, I was able to dig up a myriad of studies from the mid 90&#039;s that tried to trace back human ancestry as far as possible. One of those studies was on the Y chromosome. For years researchers cataloged thousands of Y chromosomes from men all over the world and were able to paint a pretty accurate picture of Human migration from Tanzania to the Americas. Well there was one outlier, One very important group of outliers; White Men. It seems that their Y chromosome is unique it can not be traced back to any point of origin at all. It&#039;s almost as if it just appeared one day out of thin air. When I confronted my professor about this he became angry and told me that study was discredited due to improper testing methods, but I checked the methodology that was described and it all followed proper procedure for the time and still holds true even now. After the incident all of the studies disappeared from my school&#039;s library. I&#039;ve been working on continuing the study, but it&#039;s been hard getting funding. Because it has to do with race.

Face it commie, you have been had.","time":1490832021,"resto":118850995,"id":"tYD0K6IN","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118853953,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)20:01:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118853790\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118853790<\/a><br>Let me not address my denial of 99% of world scientists or the billions of anti-climate change research being funded by organizations like Exxon Mobile, who knew about it since the 1980s and hid it!<br><br>Also the Pentagon knows about the threat, but aren&#039;t doing shit.","filename":"1478552693070","ext":".png","w":293,"h":324,"tn_w":113,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490832113514,"time":1490832113,"md5":"rcvkksiZpcYf5wu3i3KZZw==","fsize":94379,"resto":118850995,"id":"yuPWP7ny","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118854015,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)20:02:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"None of this matters","time":1490832150,"resto":118850995,"id":"iqUsQxo1","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118854268,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)20:05:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118853643\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118853643<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;no argument <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;posts a paragraph acting like a tough guy<\/span><br>Lmao the fucking dilapidated boat of Trump cocksuckers.

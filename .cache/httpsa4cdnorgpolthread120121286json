While it&#039;s *plausible* that Assad and Putin wanted to test Trump&#039;s resolve (and see if he actually had balls, unlike Obama) it seems a bit fishy to try it so brazenly. Much more likely that this was a plot (probably with Turkish assistance) to frame Assad once more as using chemical weapons and force Trump&#039;s hand and have the US tip the balance in favor of the terrorists. Assad is already winning and not an idiot, the US was not intervening, it would be massively weird for him to pull a stunt like this. <br><br>Knowing this, and maybe knowing who&#039;s responsible (Israel, US Deep State, Turkey, combination, ...), Trump saw the trap he was put in: either do nothing and lose international &#039;respect&#039; and be seen for being another weakling like Obama - and without demonstrable will to do military action, foreign policy is just bullshit and nobody takes you seriously. Or: do a military intervention and get dragged into being the willing stooge of whoever&#039;s responsible, possibly also triggering Russian response.<br><br>Trump chose option 3: a limited military strike and making it clear enough that this is a one-off attack because of chemical weapon usage. It lets him maintain the neutrality policy - The US will still not get actively involved in the war (as in troop deployments) - but not hurt Assad more than is needed. In communicating this intent with Russia, I&#039;m sure the Russians agreed that this was the best possible option (hence why they didn&#039;t intervene and, despite tough talk, will not act in response). As far as anyone&#039;s considered, the incident is closed.<br><br>In a nice bonus, Trump was meeting with Xi at the same time. Trump has made it clear that he&#039;s not afraid to throw punches.<br><br>Besides, the main airport is actually the Russian one - which was and will be left unharmed. The Syrian air force is non-existent, for practical purposes.","time":1491654671,"resto":120121286,"id":"1smQiaj3","country":"BE","country_name":"Belgium"},{"no":120126329,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)08:31:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120121286\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120121286<\/a><br>If Jeb says so.","time":1491654707,"resto":120121286,"id":"XqdiccEu","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":120126406,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)08:32:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120126271\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120126271<\/a><br>Even if it was a false flag, there were almost no casualities as Russia was warned in advance.","time":1491654764,"resto":120121286,"id":"XqdiccEu","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":120126416,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)08:32:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120121286\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120121286<\/a><br>WHAT THE FUCK JEB<br><br>I THOUGHT YOU WERE OUR GUY","time":1491654774,"resto":120121286,"id":"YD2g7+S2","country":"NZ","country_name":"New Zealand"},{"no":120126462,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)08:33:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120121286\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120121286<\/a><br>\u00a1YEB!","filename":"liljebbie","ext":".webm","w":1280,"h":720,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1491654812952,"time":1491654812,"md5":"5VcdwE\/reqNWlLKb4PJHRQ==","fsize":1231670,"resto":120121286,"id":"91dKEchT","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120126682,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)08:36:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120121286\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120121286<\/a><br>us political establishment has been infiltrated by the muslim brotherhood.","time":1491654971,"resto":120121286,"id":"Hx8FWiWx","country":"RS","country_name":"Serbia"},{"no":120126789,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)08:37:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;We could have had Jeb! instead of the current orange buffoon.<\/span>","filename":"Jeb_Jab","ext":".gif","w":320,"h":240,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1491655068336,"time":1491655068,"md5":"FU4YfdBw+EKoKAuJVx\/9mA==","fsize":2510061,"resto":120121286,"id":"ZQrWVBYw","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120126896,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)08:39:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120126406\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120126406<\/a><br>I meant the gas attack, not the American missile attack","time":1491655149,"resto":120121286,"id":"1smQiaj3","country":"BE","country_name":"Belgium"},{"no":120127018,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)08:40:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120121286\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120121286<\/a><br>There is an old adage in US politics:<br><br>Don&#039;t do as Jeb does.","time":1491655240,"resto":120121286,"id":"QXiLCQk4","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"}]}

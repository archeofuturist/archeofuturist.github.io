From my experience, druggies have a lot of this taken away from them. They are almost always so self-centered without any regard for other nor the law and whenever someone(perhaps another druggie or acquaintance) does something illegal and pays a consequence, they&#039;re so quick to immediately defend their action and defend drug use in general. Druggies also tend to focus less on other things such as their civic duties like electing governors and stuff like that.

Trump choosing not to declassify weed as a schedule 1 drug means the rich (jews, if you choose to be a dick about it) get a monopoly on the drug while the people that were originally crushed by the anti-weed policy don&#039;t make a dime.

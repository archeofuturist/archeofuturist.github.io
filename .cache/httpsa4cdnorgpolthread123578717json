And Trump Generals are hardly a safe haven from shilling, it&#039;s been a shill magnet since at least the Iowa caucus.","time":1493615591,"resto":123578717,"id":"91vt5t4v","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123582175,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)01:13:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123582008\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123582008<\/a><br>Why would you believe the lying mainstream media?","time":1493615598,"resto":123578717,"id":"\/fPeHNIB","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123582197,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)01:13:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123581948\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123581948<\/a><br>Yes, Keket brings the night and Kek raises the day.<br>Keket \/ Kekuit is the one with the frog head, while Kek has the snake head.","time":1493615613,"resto":123578717,"id":"urgcydEd","country":"RO","country_name":"Romania"},{"no":123582201,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)01:13:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"I&#039;m getting kinda sick of hearing about the Jews to be completely honest with you guys.","filename":"1482773131555","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":736,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":89,"tim":1493615617727,"time":1493615617,"md5":"Q6IFtlzgYoO6NkOtqkPhxQ==","fsize":83806,"resto":123578717,"id":"AqWx\/\/Rp","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123582210,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)01:13:42","name":"Anonymous","filename":"Immoral","ext":".png","w":621,"h":342,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":68,"tim":1493615622114,"time":1493615622,"md5":"N+Au76h9l0Qj68bC6\/qXCg==","fsize":55409,"resto":123578717,"id":"nqM6tVZf","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123582214,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)01:13:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123580762\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123580762<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;spic military strategists<\/span>","time":1493615626,"resto":123578717,"id":"I4ffnYLj","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123582219,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)01:13:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123581028\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123581028<\/a>","filename":"harukasan14","ext":".webm","w":226,"h":222,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":122,"tim":1493615630766,"time":1493615630,"md5":"fWyI9\/ESsHZVhGKd3dp2Zg==","fsize":89897,"resto":123578717,"id":"\/VaOl+Fg","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123582221,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)01:13:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123582005\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123582005<\/a><br><br>Bullshit.","time":1493615631,"resto":123578717,"id":"F0i\/x62v","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123582247,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)01:14:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123581889\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123581889<\/a><br>How much is Jared paying you to protect globalist Trump?<br><br>You obviously are not an American because ever since we have had American presidents, they have intervened and discussed issues that have nothing to do with being federal.

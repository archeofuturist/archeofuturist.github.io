Typical breakfast meats in America are bacon, Canadian bacon, breakfast sausage, ham, scrapple, pork roll, Spam, steak, or country fried steak, while in Canada, peameal bacon or cretons are often served. In the Southern US, grits are typically included. Breads served might include toasted bread, English muffins, bagels, or biscuits. Beverages such as coffee and orange juice may be included, and pancakes, waffles, or French toast might accompany the other items, possibly replacing the bread component. In areas with high Irish populations, such as New York and the East Coast, a full English breakfast is more commonly known as an Irish breakfast after the Irish immigration from the UK during the potato famine.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Full<wbr>_breakfast#North_America<\/span>","time":1493617059,"resto":123578717,"id":"ofhtC66Q","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123584210,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)01:37:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123583983\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123583983<\/a><br>No, it&#039;s something they can put off once to do these other things now.

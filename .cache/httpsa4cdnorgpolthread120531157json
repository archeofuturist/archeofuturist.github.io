These attackers are coming primarily from r\/MarchAgainstTrump and our good old &quot;friend&quot; \/leftypol\/.<br>Here is a link to their Discord where they are coordinating the attack: https:\/\/discordapp.com\/channels\/275<wbr>336689419812865\/275336689419812865 (please note that their mods have locked any invites due to their fears of \/pol\/ infiltrators).<br><br>Their goal is not only to get \/pol\/ to dump Trump altogether, but they also want to subvert our board and turn it into another leftist circlejerk like \/leftypol\/ and SRS. You may have noticed a bunch of new threads shilling for Tulsi Gabbard in 2020 (Tulsi is a pro amnesty Democratic canidate) and posts calling Trump a kike neocon puppet for ordering his one-off missile strike in Syria. Those are their threads. Don&#039;t beleive what they post, don&#039;t reply to their threads, and report the shit out of them if they violate a rule.<br>(1\/2)","filename":"1491856686549","ext":".png","w":735,"h":625,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":212,"tim":1491875235397,"time":1491875235,"md5":"9bmwzn9Ht1KrBzaIdh73Lw==","fsize":329708,"resto":0,"id":"zFVBOgIM","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"psa","country_name":"United States","replies":22,"images":10,"unique_ips":10},{"no":120531311,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)21:48:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"Now onto their tactics. Their tactics are very simple and make it very easy to spot these invaders. They will come swarming into every pro-Trump thread and spam anti-Trump memes. They also like to call anybody who doesn&#039;t hate Trump a &quot;r\/T_D shill&quot; or Cadre shill. Cadre is a fake shill organization that the r\/MAT invaders use to try and deflect criticism of their raid. Be wary of anybody claiming to be a so-called \/pol\/ oldfag who spams anti Trump memes and shills for the pro immigration Tulsi Gabbard. <br><br>Defense against these leftist subverters is also incredibly easy. Do these actions if you want to see the lefties squirm:<br>1. Post screenshots of their Discord. These screenshots have been floating around on \/pol\/ for days now and they&#039;re easy to find. Posting them in a thread with shills will trigger them to no end. Watch them bumrush your post with free (you)s as they desperately try their shitty attempts at damage control.<br>2. Be as offensive as humanly possible. Leaked Discord screenshots have shown us that while they may be LARPing as \/pol\/acks, these lesfties are still just as offended by the content of this board as any other SJW from Reddit. Feel free to call them niggers, kikes, trannies and every slur under the sun. Post anti-nigger pics and infographics and don&#039;t forget the PooPoo PeePee pepes! You can find the best PooPoo Pepes at pepebooru if you don&#039;t already have a folder.<br>3. Just shitpost and troll them to death. No further explanation needed!<br><br>Watch yourselves out there and don&#039;t let these leftist shills fool you. They aren&#039;t and they never will be true \/pol\/acks and they will NEVER subvert \/pol\/!

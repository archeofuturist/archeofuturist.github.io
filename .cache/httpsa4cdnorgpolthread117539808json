I lived there since 2011, attending a local university then working for a couple years in the city. I&#039;ll briefly try to explain why I think that Houston&#039;s trajectory is a grim omen for the future of the country as a whole.<br><br>Houston is not a &quot;real&quot; city. It is not a city that arose from coherent neighborhoods and communities into a larger whole. Houston is more like an encampment of economic nomads, people who arrive in the city with no prior connections, and leave just as quickly in order to chase other economic opportunities. It has a very transient feel to it, and a lack of &quot;community.&quot; <br><br>It is also a collection pond for human refuse of various types - the ghetto trash (including the famous Katrina refugees), illiterate Central American peasants, a bizarre array of &quot;refugees&quot; from every hellish corner of this Earth, and quite a few dead-enders who moved to the area because it is cheaper than most other cities, then got stuck due to not having any money.<br><br>Economic nomadism and lack of community leads to GRIFTERS on a mass-scale. This is something I noticed quickly about the city - the quantity of scammers and hucksters and cheats is South Florida-tier. And they can get away with it because there is always a new crop of suckers moving in. <br><br>There is a lot of crime and PREDATION - and Houston criminals are often quite brutal, executing robbery victims in front of their own families without hesitation. Several such cases have taken place in just the past month. And due to the lack of cohesion and trust, these crimes often go unsolved. Nobody really wants to help each other out.<br><br>I will continue...","filename":"Houston aerial","ext":".jpg","w":800,"h":600,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1490048391474,"time":1490048391,"md5":"RJGdp+9L+ISr7OiXUx4rVA==","fsize":31738,"resto":0,"id":"t7ULr1PB","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"houston-an-american-disaster","country_name":"United States","replies":11,"images":2,"unique_ips":8},{"no":117540062,"now":"03\/20\/17(Mon)18:21:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"Houston has always interested me, as a city planning student.

I do plan on moving though, but your demographics and reasoning are pretty flawed. There are tons of communities here that the economic boom grew around not destroyed, and lots of infrastructure and city development for public use. It&#039;s one of the only major cities in the USA worth living in, and I&#039;ve been to most of them","time":1490048690,"resto":117539808,"id":"N6g6K2I4","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117541570,"now":"03\/20\/17(Mon)18:31:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117539808\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117539808<\/a><br>The physical environment of Houston reflects is nomadic nature and lack of cohesion. It is basically a massive sprawl stitched together with giant freeways that nonetheless struggle to manage the growing volume of traffic.<br><br>Many places in the Houston area are uninhabitable due to crime or unfavorable demographics, which necessitates a flight to distant suburbs if you the lack the money to afford more desirable areas closer to the core of the city. <br><br>This makes the whole region feel even more disjointed, as people often work and spend their days in locations an hour or more from where they actually live, which is often in an entirely different political district for things like Congressional elections. <br><br>The lack of coherence expresses itself in a general lack of planning. The city&#039;s periodic floods (and the absence of any real flood control plan) is one such symptom. Many aspects of civic management, infrastructure, etc. feel quite third-world, both due to demographics and the lack of community interest in helping guide such efforts.<br><br>Houston, finally, is strikingly nonwhite. While I was there, whites were visibly vanishing from certain areas of the city. If you are white and intend to raise a family in the area, you are restricted to a relatively narrow slate of options. Many formerly-white neighborhoods and suburbs are no longer so. <br><br>Houston is an entrepot. It&#039;s a place you visit in order to grab as much loot as you can before moving on. I found it rather depressing after a while. <br><br>And yet, this is what things look like when you treat &quot;the individual&quot; as the primary unit of social organization. This is what you get. <br><br>And it&#039;s a goddamned nightmare.","filename":"Houston Freeway","ext":".jpg","w":683,"h":1024,"tn_w":83,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490049108046,"time":1490049108,"md5":"TyWlXImfrsXTV9hNU6kBRg==","fsize":395232,"resto":117539808,"id":"t7ULr1PB","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117542002,"now":"03\/20\/17(Mon)18:34:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117539808\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117539808<\/a><br>I grew up all over Houston.

But it is verified by me, that James Alefantis has a character at another world the Midsummer Nights Dream world as it was depicted in the disclosure movie (1935 version). <br><br>Oberon from Midsummer Nights Dream is the main wizard of that lore and he controls the James Alefantis (Elfin-type w\/hoofs) guy from Midsummer Nights Dream. That Oberon is connecting through the Midsummer Nights Dream world version to the version here and manipulating him. <br><br>The reason I think they are implementing things this way is to give Oberon a foothold in this world - he is an MC at deletion ceremonies when the main machine deletes data it does so with pomp and circumstance.<br><br>Another interesting note, that particular movie had its budget Mandela Effect&#039;d, it was originally stated and I know because I looked it up in the last 6 months. It now states that it was under a million dollars. That&#039;s not even possible for back then for that type of movie with those elaborate sets and costumes. The real budget was ~39 million USD. Compare the sets and costumes and # and quality of actors and actresses to other similar movies and you&#039;ll see what I mean. <br><br>-Wickedshamansaid","filename":"oberon","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":640,"tn_w":195,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490438357067,"time":1490438357,"md5":"CmpqdZEg3cHfLG\/RDotYZA==","fsize":55236,"resto":0,"id":"P1ZYrZTl","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"james-alefantis-his-true-sponsor","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

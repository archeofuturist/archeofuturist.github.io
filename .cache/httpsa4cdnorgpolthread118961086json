Since they were discontent people actually outperformed them while they were out drinking. The universities caved, not entirely, but massively. They removed the highest grade, think magna cum laude. It was a high achievement, still present in secondary and primary education it took something like 95% conventionally. Instead there&#039;s only pass, and pass with distinction. Conventionally 50% and 75%. Since the bar for the highest grade is so low, there is very little stock put in your actual grade. It&#039;s not possible to be academically distinguished in Sweden, and you do not want to aim for it. If you&#039;re focusing on studying instead of networking while in University you are monumentally stupid and probably can&#039;t even achieve a passing grade.","time":1490905543,"resto":118961086,"id":"R\/aV1ZXR","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":118963741,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)16:27:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118962542\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118962542<\/a><br><br>Eyy fellow KTH bro, which program?","time":1490905674,"resto":118961086,"id":"5Mri7xXZ","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"}]}

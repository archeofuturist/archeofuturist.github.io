And idea which terrifies the jews especially in the US. An armed moral society swiftly becomes a white nationalistic society. This is precisely what Hitler created in Germany back in the 40s. That being said I do not hate white atheists because in truth the only reason they are that way because the jews have brainwashed them with anti white and anti Christ media. This is understandable, even hitler had shakings in his faith towards the end of the war as he saw the Bolshevik hoard descending on Germany to rape and murder the population. But this ideology should neither be accepted nor encouraged, A people without a god is a people is a killable people but a people with a religion have something they can trace back to the begging&#039;s of their society.

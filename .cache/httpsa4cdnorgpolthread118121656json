I am 18 now and I want to find my parents. My friend Stanley and I went out into the deserts a year ago and found a chest filled with thousands worth of money and documents. I used some of that money to hire a private investigation team that did barely helped at all. I want to take it to the internet because I feel it is easy to spread my message out in better hopes of finding my mother and father.

I went out to dinner with a group of friends tonight, and then we were going to the movies. I ate a lot at dinner because I love the restaurant and why do I even have to explain my eating habits?! My boyfriend and I had tickets waiting for us at the booth and the rest of our friends had tickets in hand already, so they went in before us. Well we get our tickets, head in, and the guy ripping our tickets strikes up a conversation with me about the weather, something about the rain. I nod, and I had my hand on my stomach because I was so full still from dinner - and he then asks, &quot;Aww, when is your baby due?&quot; I must have stared at him in disbelief - his face quickly faded from a smile and all I could manage to say was &quot;There is no baby.&quot; THEN HE PROCEEDS TO CHUCKLE AND ASK ME IF I&#039;M JOKING. And my boyfriend walked away to go to the bathroom to leave me to deal with this BS asshat moron!! I was in tears at the beginning of the movie, but then Disney. So yeah. I feel pretty shitty about myself this evening.","time":1493100615,"resto":122701479,"id":"eUAiFKtC","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122702199,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)02:15:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Fuck him.

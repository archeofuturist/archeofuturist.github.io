They called me an idiot for defending free market and scruitinizing their socialist health, gov, economic system. I pointed out how i paid &quot;spaga&quot; to the doctors when i got bitten by a stray dog so i can cut in front of the line of what seemed like 30 people waiting all day to get seen by a doctor. I pointed out how half of them dont have jobs or businesses, but they expect others to pay for their pensions, their roads, and their shitty health care. I was of course ostracized and they tried to make me feel &quot;stupid&quot; or call me &quot;low iq\/redus&quot; or brainwashed indoctrinated American. If i go back i can still find them jerking off on the couch while waiting for their moms to hand them&quot;50 lei&quot; . I love Romania, but god damn the people are fucking retarded.

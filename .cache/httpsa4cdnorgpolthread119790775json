Do they realise that, behind all loud words like &quot;freedom&quot; and &quot;self-sovereignty&quot;, this ideology means basically &quot;you are responsible for your own actions; if you fuck up, noone will take responsibility for you, pay for you or forgive you because of your feelings&quot;. How anyone in their right mind want to live in society based on this retarded principles? this is outright tyranny: if i must met consequences of my actions that means i can&#039;t do what i want, therefore i&#039;m not free. That&#039;s why i&#039;m communist, i know that all my shortcomings are society&#039;s fault and not mine. And all you ancap idiots stay deluded and crave that hell called ancap.","filename":"sumerechnaya-iskorka","ext":".jpg","w":1500,"h":1368,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":228,"tim":1491510980521,"time":1491510980,"md5":"jR4SE6UfDdyUy8hdWr7PfQ==","fsize":246284,"resto":0,"id":"lE1SkYXk","country":"RU","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"i-cant-understand-how-people-can-even-fall-for","country_name":"Russian Federation","replies":1,"images":1,"unique_ips":2},{"no":119791515,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)16:41:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119790775\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119790775<\/a><br>Piss off, barneyfag!","filename":"IMG_0574","ext":".png","w":307,"h":156,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":63,"tim":1491511297856,"time":1491511297,"md5":"UebAta56S3DVLtqWZvnMxg==","fsize":17402,"resto":119790775,"id":"0iT3XBPx","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]}

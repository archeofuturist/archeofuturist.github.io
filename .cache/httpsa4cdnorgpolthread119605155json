But I hope he&#039;ll prove me wrong.<br>The french election is very different in that unlike the two previous you mentionned, this is not an either\/or situation with two possibilities. Just like in the Netherlands. Both the FN and the PVV are old political forces that are widely disliked for previous actions, that are known for their inner problems, etc. We know they were opposition parties for a long time and have just recently gone on a demogogue rampage to make themselves electable. Which is what makes it hard to take them seriously when they claim to be anti-system while very deeply engrained within it, anti-corruption despite being largely corrupt themselves. You can&#039;t change completely in such a short amount of time and it shows in their economic or administrative policies that they do not have a clear project.","time":1491400007,"resto":119605155,"id":"+uyXe1Tc","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":119607764,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)09:48:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119605155\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119605155<\/a><br>Give me a quick rundown of differences between her and Melechont?<br>Because they way I see it, they&#039;re both eurosceptics, both towards EU and Euro as a currency, they are both Putin&#039;s buddys, and \/pol\/ is always telling me that Le Pen is really socialist on welfare issues.","time":1491400114,"resto":119605155,"id":"kzHiJ1Yf","country":"SI","country_name":"Slovenia"},{"no":119607780,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)09:48:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119607417\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119607417<\/a><br>Again, they&#039;ll vote for Macron.

Estimates are that we can produce Thorium Nuclear energy for about 1.5-3 cents per kilowatt-hour. <br>We&#039;ll be conservative and say 3 cents. This includes all of our costs of generation: fuel, maintenance, operations, and capital costs for the plant itself. Add in about 4 cents for transmission and distribution and you have a total of about 7 cents to generate and deliver power to customers.<br><br>What if we built enough capacity to generate 10% of US power?<br><br>$100 billion investment ($2000\/kw)<br><br>Produces 438 billion kilowatt hours electricity annually<br><br> Sell the power at 15 cents\/kwh= $65.7 billion in revenue.<br><br> Subtract (438 billion * .07 = $30.66 billion) costs<br><br>=$35.04 billion profit<br><br>35.04% return on capital (pays for itself within 3 years)<br><br>$35.04 billion cash flow for ~60 years <br><br>Build needed infrastructure<br><br>Reduced carbon emissions<br><br>Cut electricity rates in high-cost states<br>What if we invested $10 trillion in thorium reactors and got the same 35% return on investment? $3.5 trillion per year in free cash flow.

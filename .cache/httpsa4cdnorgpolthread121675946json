Solid fuel means they can launch on a moment&#039;s notice with no prep-time instead of taking hours to fuel with liquid fuel with time-limited readiness in that state due to the corrosive nature of the fuel.<br><br>Tracked TELs is also a problem for IRBMs as it means that the launches are not tied to paved or graded roads. Makes it harder to keep track of launchers.<br><br>Basically the calculus is changing somewhat due to improving Nork technology. Previously the US could comfort themselves in the believe (well-founded or not) that they could find and destroy launchers prior to launch. Now they can&#039;t.","time":1492520039,"resto":121675946,"id":"SqajIEyr","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121681295,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)08:55:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121680851\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121680851<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121680571\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121680571<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121679962\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121679962<\/a><br><br>do you sameflags know where to get some atropine autoinjectors?

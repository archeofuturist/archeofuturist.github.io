Solid fuel means they can launch on a moment&#039;s notice with no prep-time instead of taking hours to fuel with liquid fuel with time-limited readiness in that state due to the corrosive nature of the fuel.<br><br>Tracked TELs is also a problem for IRBMs as it means that the launches are not tied to paved or graded roads. Makes it harder to keep track of launchers.<br><br>Basically the calculus is changing somewhat due to improving Nork technology. Previously the US could comfort themselves in the believe (well-founded or not) that they could find and destroy launchers prior to launch.

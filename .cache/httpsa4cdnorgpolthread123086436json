Keep a living root in the soil as long as possible. If you grow annual crops, plant cover crops that grow all winter. Or find a perennial system. Or a hybrid.<br><br>2. Biodiversity. Many different kinds of plants and you have to include animals. But, if you need to knock down your multi species cover crop, you can use your cows for short and intensive grazing, which will also knock the crop down, then you can follow them up with chickens. This allows you to stack enterprises, so if your main cash crop gets fucked, eh, oh well. <br><br>3. Always keep your soil covered. Living plants, forest canopy, or the residu of your recent crop\/cover crop. This stops rain from washing soil away, and reduces soil temps, which reduces water use.<br><br>4.

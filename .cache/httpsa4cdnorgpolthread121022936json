They clearly did not mean &quot;all&quot; men are created equal, they meant all &quot;white non degenerate men&quot; are created equal. This isn&#039;t such a stretch to believe. They restricted voting to only property holding whites in most states... even though all men are created &quot;equal&quot;.<br><br>Why then do you cling to &quot;shall not be infringed&quot;?

They clearly did not mean &quot;all&quot; men are created equal, they meant all &quot;white non degenerate men&quot; are created equal. This isn&#039;t such a stretch to believe. They restricted voting to only property holding whites in most states... even though all men are created &quot;equal&quot;.<br><br>Why then do you cling to &quot;shall not be infringed&quot;? Clearly nigs and other trash members of society shouldn&#039;t have access in the first place. <br><br>The more you cling to egalitarianism, the more it will drag you down. Holding the position keep gubmint off my guns just lets subs get access to them more easily, what we need is a a government we actually control not one that keeps its hands off us.<br><br>Practically, there should be radical gun control with only qualifying members of society both being allowed to possess arms and being forced to train with them.","filename":"JD Radix","ext":".jpg","w":713,"h":533,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":186,"tim":1492147144700,"time":1492147144,"md5":"S7kt27qfM2V9d95+UhAP5A==","fsize":87810,"resto":0,"id":"2T9gLl+v","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"2nd-amendment-fags-get-in-here","country_name":"United States","replies":4,"images":0,"unique_ips":4},{"no":121023955,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)01:30:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"So i guess we all agree, gun rights should be infringed from blacks and Mexicans since they didn&#039;t have the rights to begin with.

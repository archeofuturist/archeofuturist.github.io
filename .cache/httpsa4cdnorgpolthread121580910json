With the exception of some specific kinds of neuropathic pains cannabis is pretty much useless as a painkiller. To get even small painkilling effects you have to smoke\/eat a shit ton, which will make you pretty much unable to function normally, or drive, or work. And still the painkilling effects are really small.<br><br>How could you even compare that to opioids which are by far the best painkillers ever created? You get almost completely rid of even pretty serious pains by taking doses that get you slightly drowsy at most, still perfectly able to work and stuff. And &quot;slowly killing them&quot;? How exactly do opioids kill anyone? (unless you overdose hard obviously) Death by constipation? That&#039;s pretty much their only major negative health effect, and if it gets bad there&#039;s drugs against constipation... Sure, if you have to take them for years, addiction is gonna be a bitch. But if you only took them to help against your pains, and not to escape your shitty life, quitting them is not that bad really. It&#039;s a couple of weeks of feeling like you had a flu and every place aching. Small price to pay if that meant you were able to live years of painfree normal life.<br><br>Don&#039;t get me wrong, I love smoking weed, and it also has some real medical uses.

Why did he wait for many months -- and do it only when the war took a bad turn for the Union, and, more important, when the superpowers of the day, Great Britain and France, were about to recognize the Confederacy and come to its aid? Viewed realistically, abolition of slavery was by any measure a stratagem in pursuit of a purely pragmatic goal: to win over British and French public opinion and scare away the Confederacy&#039;s potential allies, whose assistance might have had a crucial effect on the outcome of the war. It was a brilliant and highly successful tactical move.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;As a matter of fact, the president never tried to hide his real objective. He wrote: &quot;I view the matter [Emancipation Proclamation] as a practical war measure, to be decided upon according to the advantages or disadvantages it may offer to the suppression of the rebellion.&quot; And here is another confession of the Great Emancipator: &quot;I will also concede that emancipation would help us in Europe, and convince them that we are incited by something more than ambition.&quot; Lincoln had every reason to fret over the Europeans&#039; suspicions of his intentions. The Old World largely (ironically, with the exception of that bastion of reaction, Russia) sided with the Confederacy, which was viewed as a victim of a predatory North driven by greed.<\/span>","filename":"LincolnOnRace","ext":".jpg","w":705,"h":493,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":87,"tim":1491004147231,"time":1491004147,"md5":"d94ciuhp1f6kbSJyKoMaIw==","fsize":163408,"resto":119115566,"id":"sJhN85QR","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119117116,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)19:51:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119116819\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119116819<\/a><br>war was about slavery, all you&#039;re doing is proving lincoln had ulterior motives. south still succeeded primarily to continue being slavers.","time":1491004304,"resto":119115566,"id":"BbeuV2zW","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119117333,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)19:53:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119115566\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119115566<\/a><br>OP i think slavery is great since it ensures the possibility of minimum quality of treatment, but odds are most of these niggers wont use it that way. the idea of enslaving someone and treating them well is pretty much non existant in society. just look at the way we treat animals. in theory it is a perfect system like communism or white washed fascism. but in reality both are ruined by the constituant people involved in creating and perpetuating the ideals.","filename":"1489449842423","ext":".jpg","w":589,"h":423,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":89,"tim":1491004427623,"time":1491004427,"md5":"oK4PgNPPqXC6tWgnD7\/7IA==","fsize":136157,"resto":119115566,"id":"BbeuV2zW","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119117464,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)19:54:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119117116\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119117116<\/a><br>lol I&#039;m not denying it was about slavery and that it was only abolished for reasons than sympathizing with niggers.

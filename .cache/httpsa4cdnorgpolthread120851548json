Women will basically be working all the highly-educated, highly-paid jobs (basically the only ones that will exist anymore in an automized world) to pay all the taxes to subsidize all the social programs that support all the men who don&#039;t wanna do anything but watch sports and have consequence-free sexual release that they&#039;ll just achieve solo if need be. The social climate women enjoy most is the one where their artificial scarcity in the sexual market allows them to play the hypergamy game; being coy and picky, paradoxically all wanting the top 10% of men. Men won&#039;t be competing for women any more. The dream man who&#039;s handsome, fit, educated, and successful is going to have 10 times as many suitors as he does now, suitors who will have even more to offer him like success of their own among other qualities they try to bring to the table like men used to have to.

By replying to those threads without putting &quot;sage&quot; (without quotation marks) in the options field bumps those threads to the top and lets good topics slide, therefore undermining the real discussion and real investigations going on. Please do not participate in helping paid shills and normies making it harder for everyone to keep track of good topics.<br><br><br>If you have been here longer please contribute by reminding new posters of this and posting infos on shill and slide strategies, as well as not giving in and leaving for other boards.","filename":"43411_shill_alert_op4w","ext":".jpg","w":402,"h":402,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":249,"tim":1490860505150,"time":1490860505,"md5":"Dh87\/p3505vRwuCtbPQUAg==","fsize":79187,"resto":0,"id":"TDgto2nu","country":"DE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"daily-reminder-that-pol-is-compromised","country_name":"Germany","replies":5,"images":2,"unique_ips":2},{"no":118899799,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)03:56:51","name":"Anonymous","filename":"1490685697517","ext":".png","w":1156,"h":2031,"tn_w":71,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490860611706,"time":1490860611,"md5":"uPwJAqzT86jiDTKQ2FKZbw==","fsize":280810,"resto":118899679,"id":"TDgto2nu","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":118899806,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)03:56:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118899679\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118899679<\/a><br>Just report that shit and go on with your life.

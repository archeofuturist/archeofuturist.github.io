Fending off the growing criticism, the administration invited lawmakers from both parties to view classified material it said relates to surveillance of the president&#039;s associates. The invitation came as The New York Times reported that two White House officials - including an aide whose job was recently saved by President Donald Trump - secretly helped House intelligence committee chairman Devin Nunes examine intelligence information last week.<br><br>Sources close to the Trump Campaign are alluding to President Donald J. Trump stepping down from office and resigning in fear of facing impeachment proceedings. This will be the first weekend where President Trump will not be going to Mar-a-Lago, his commonly known &quot;Southern White House&quot; as many speculate that President Trump will be buckling down on these new allegations that he had colluded with Russia and had help from Russia&#039;s leader, Vladimir Putin. <br><br>The source also stated to media that the entire campaign is in frenzy mode and that all people are now making the appropriate measures to bolster ties with Vice President Michael Pence. &quot;Everything is in a total state of chaos here, Trump could be facing criminal charges and if that were to happen, it would cause an immediate investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (sic) into tampering with the election which could bring about totally different results in which case Hillary R. Clinton could be named the actual victor in the presidential election (sic) - this would be much, much larger and more scandalous in nature than Watergate.&quot;<br><br>DEVELOPING STORY<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;tfw he&#039;s being impeached tomorrow<\/span>","time":1490939520,"resto":119026422,"id":"4tR2vvUs","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119026882,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)01:52:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119026422\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119026422<\/a><br>That isn&#039;t our goal, shill. <br>Nice try.","time":1490939541,"resto":119026422,"id":"OW+2KJmK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119026933,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)01:53:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119026780\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119026780<\/a><br>We can dream, I hate that all our esotericism has been grouped together into kekism","time":1490939580,"resto":119026422,"id":"x3znaMUv","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":119026983,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)01:53:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;We stopped Hillary.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;That was the goal.<\/span><br>You sure do sound like a 60iq sub human monkey.","time":1490939619,"resto":119026422,"id":"JiJBB5\/g","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":119027181,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)01:56:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119026849\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119026849<\/a><br>Everything after 1st paragraph is made up bullshit. <br><br>Anyway hope you&#039;re ready to die for President Mattis in the Sino-American war of 2019.","time":1490939782,"resto":119026422,"id":"q8Js1LfS","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119027278,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)01:57:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119027181\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119027181<\/a><br>Incorrect, what you read earlier was a developing story.<br><br>This is not good news.

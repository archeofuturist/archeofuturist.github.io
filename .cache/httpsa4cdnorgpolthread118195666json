And I&#039;m catching up on today&#039;s news to take my mind off of the fact that this will be my existence for many years.<br><br>So I find myself asking myself if I would be willing to commit treason for 0.5% of a Russian oil company if it meant taking care of all my problems. But the answer is always.... no.<br><br>Of course, no.<br><br>America is pretty fucked up but I&#039;m proud to be American. I don&#039;t care what other people think, but I care what I think. I couldn&#039;t disrespect what my grandfather and uncles died for defending this country against assholes, for money. I couldn&#039;t disrespect what I want America to symbolize to the world, for money.<br><br>What brings a person to that point? Especially a person who HAS money. A person who lives comfortably and has never known poverty. What brings them to betray their country and dignity, for more money?<br><br>I want money, but there&#039;s a limit before I don&#039;t need any more.","filename":"22gif-superJumbo","ext":".jpg","w":799,"h":534,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":167,"tim":1490423270390,"time":1490423270,"md5":"zO7LfEy\/MwI8BKuoAdtiRg==","fsize":49534,"resto":0,"id":"UqMPmNpT","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"so-im-sitting-here-in-my-cheap-car-in-the-middle","country_name":"United States","replies":18,"images":3,"unique_ips":19},{"no":118196350,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)02:36:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"ultimately in the capitalist system money matters more than anything. it supersedes family, nation, everything. the rich have no reason to care about you simply because you are from the same geographical area, they see you as a means to further their own interests.<br><br>you are welcome to bring your concerns to \/leftypol\/, tovarisch :^)","filename":"focus on helping our own","ext":".jpg","w":480,"h":639,"tn_w":93,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490423762145,"time":1490423762,"md5":"O2JCzsR9E0Gqb3Ny01\/O7g==","fsize":77698,"resto":118195666,"id":"MEAkQrzR","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118197607,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)02:51:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118195666\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118195666<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;muh gnome<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;muh django<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;muh mysql<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;muh os x<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;mug gif<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;muh Mbps<\/span><br><br>pic is right but wrong. creator already said it doesn&#039;t matter which way.","time":1490424706,"resto":118195666,"id":"c2sAJLzx","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118197791,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)02:54:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118195666\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118195666<\/a><br>Jif is a peanut butter you fag","time":1490424854,"resto":118195666,"id":"TGGET2Zz","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118198189,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)02:59:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118196350\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118196350<\/a><br>Yeah man the powerful totally care about you in communism!!!!

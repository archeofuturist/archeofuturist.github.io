Make it seem as absurd as possible.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Suggest there is nothing wrong with women exploring their own bodies, it&#039;s empowering. Suggest women do insane shit to be &quot;empowering&quot;.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Go full open borders, mention we need to take in 50 TIMES THE REFUGEES and call them a racist if they disagree.

To answer this fundamental question, scientists have devised three basic parameters that constitute an attractive face: averageness, symmetry and sexual dimorphism, that is, physical features that distinguish one gender from another.<br><br>The first characteristic refers to the tendency for humans to find statistically average facial features more appealing than atypical ones. This means that we usually prefer medium-sized noses to big or very small ones, and eyes that are neither too close together nor too far apart.<br><br>The second aspect, symmetry, has been found to be essential to our appraisal of beauty, since facial symmetry is considered an indicator of good health and a robust immune system. As we\u2019ll see in the next blink, both of these features are also aesthetically appealing.<br><br>Finally, the importance of sexual dimorphism means that people who have typically male or female features are considered more attractive. For example, a large chin is often considered a typically manly feature; just think of Brad Pitt\u2019s chiseled chin and try to say he\u2019s not an attractive man!","filename":"648495cbee70ce46b84f4043ed4f0610a646d1c51afa76683093201271739f23-pol","ext":".jpg","w":1528,"h":1078,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":88,"tim":1492484446542,"time":1492484446,"md5":"Pk1dRPcyBIv5WCijgV6mfA==","fsize":75616,"resto":121619745,"id":"+gNAZ84Q","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"}]}

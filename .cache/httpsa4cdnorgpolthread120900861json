Welcome to Celt\/pol\/ <br><br>Discuss your culture, traditions and how filthy Anglo-Saxon scum ruined and sullied our lands and stripped us of our native languages and culture. <br><br>Wee bit of history about our peoples: <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;From around 750 BC to 12 BC, the Celts were the most powerful people in central and northern Europe. There were many groups (tribes) of Celts, speaking a vaguely common language. The word Celt comes from the Greek word, Keltoi, which means barbarians and is properly pronounced as &quot;Kelt&quot;.<\/span><br><br>A misconception that (((Anglos))) will spam in this thread is that all Celts are just Anglos with a different accent; this couldn&#039;t be further from the truth as almost ALL Celts are ethnically homogeneous excluding mixing from other celtic nations e.g Scotland and Ireland in which admixture between the two is very prominent.<br><br>What nations are Celtic? Contrary to what the Anglo-Saxon savage has taught you, Celtic nations are not exclusive to the British Isles, in fact we are one of the most diverse group of peoples in Western Europe, ranging from Asturias all the way to Breizh. Underneath this text you will find the celtic countries listed to spare confusion.<br><br>- Asturias: Between the regions of Galicia and Cantabria in northern Spain.<br>- Breizh: In Brittany on France\u2019s northwest coast.<br>- Kernow: In the county of Cornwall on England\u2019s west coast.<br>- Galicia: On Spain\u2019s northwest coast.<br>- Eire: Ireland.<br>- Mannin: The Isle of Man.<br>- Alba: Scotland<br>- Cymru: Wales <br><br>Remember brothers, the anglo has raped our women and pillaged our cities and villages for millennia. Never forget the fallen of our peoples who were sent to die across the world because of a bunch of fugly anglo neckbearded generals who used Scots, Welsh and Irishmen alike as cannon-fodder for their brutal wars against other White European countries.","filename":"1424902586261","ext":".jpg","w":434,"h":567,"tn_w":191,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492084065862,"time":1492084065,"md5":"XNrtT\/Zl\/MtmnGECSTEchg==","fsize":43078,"resto":0,"id":"0JXeiQXy","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"celtpol-sons-of-europa-edition","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":98,"images":26,"unique_ips":42},{"no":120901029,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)07:49:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"This panceltica will come true we will meme it into existence","filename":"1491488599455","ext":".png","w":2000,"h":1322,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":82,"tim":1492084194753,"time":1492084194,"md5":"+IDvUTViBu6Y6lx85Bujng==","fsize":275465,"resto":120900861,"id":"XrIiMdfD","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"},{"no":120901139,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)07:51:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"Hush child.<br><br>Lowland Scots are Germanic by the way.","filename":"Anglo-Saxon nordid","ext":".png","w":1177,"h":686,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":72,"tim":1492084270168,"time":1492084270,"md5":"lRjzQPMWKtDRbgI37pkdyw==","fsize":353947,"resto":120900861,"id":"0EghjBCF","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":120901276,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)07:52:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120901139\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120901139<\/a><br>Lowland Scot here with Scottish ancestry dating back 450 years, try again abo <br><br><a href=\"#p120901029\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120901029<\/a> <br>Soon brother","time":1492084369,"resto":120900861,"id":"0JXeiQXy","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120901575,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)07:56:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"This reminds me of the MMO Dark age of Camelot.

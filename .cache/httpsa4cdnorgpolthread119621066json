In a 130-page indictment the group was accused of attempting to purchase fuses, piping for the construction of mortars, and chemical precursors for sarin. Five of those arrested were freed after a brief detention. The others, including the ringleader, Haytham Qassab, for whom the prosecutor requested a prison sentence of 25 years, were released pending trial. In the meantime the Turkish press has been rife with speculation that the Erdo\u011fan administration has been covering up the extent of its involvement with the rebels. In a news conference last summer, Aydin Sezgin, Turkey\u2019s ambassador to Moscow, dismissed the arrests and claimed to reporters that the recovered \u2018sarin\u2019 was merely \u2018anti-freeze\u2019.<br><br>The DIA paper took the arrests as evidence that al-Nusra was expanding its access to chemical weapons. It said Qassab had \u2018self-identified\u2019 as a member of al-Nusra, and that he was directly connected to Abd-al-Ghani, the \u2018ANF emir for military manufacturing\u2019. Qassab and his associate Khalid Ousta worked with Halit Unalkaya, an employee of a Turkish firm called Zirve Export, who provided \u2018price quotes for bulk quantities of sarin precursors\u2019. Abd-al-Ghani\u2019s plan was for two associates to \u2018perfect a process for making sarin, then go to Syria to train others to begin large scale production at an unidentified lab in Syria\u2019. The DIA paper said that one of his operatives had purchased a precursor on the \u2018Baghdad chemical market\u2019, which \u2018has supported at least seven CW efforts since 2004\u2019.<br>https:\/\/www.lrb.co.uk\/v36\/n08\/seymo<wbr>ur-m-hersh\/the-red-line-and-the-rat<wbr>-line","time":1491411916,"resto":119621066,"id":"DcSF88fn","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119627233,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)13:06:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Alt-Right leader gets outed<\/span><br><br>How will the alt-right ever recover?","time":1491411966,"resto":119621066,"id":"1YvjfRek","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119627251,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)13:06:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"Bannon more like Banned HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA","time":1491411974,"resto":119621066,"id":"c40R\/pBN","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":119627279,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)13:06:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119626919\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119626919<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;he said it<\/span><br>Are you -12?","time":1491411998,"resto":119621066,"id":"DcSF88fn","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119627378,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)13:07:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119621066\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119621066<\/a><br>The inauguration speech that he wrote was embarrassing.

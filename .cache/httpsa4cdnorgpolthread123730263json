Have a read and tell me if it sounds like your country. These are the 10 planks of the communist manifesto, which marx talked about as being CRUCIAL to taking over the country.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;2. A heavy progressive or graduated income tax.<\/span><br><br>In 1942, to help fund World War II, the federal government took over the raising of all income tax, combined with various State income taxes. This was one of the first planks of the communist manifesto installed by the Marxist agenda in Australia many decades ago. These taxes continue to drain the lifeblood out of the Australian economy and greatly reduce the accumulation of desperately needed capital for future growth, business starts, job creation, and salary increases.<br><br>Furthermore, a quick breakdown of the country&#039;s expenditure will tell a tale of how these taxes are not building roads, hospitals or schools but rather an endless army of bureaucrats which are used to impose upon and regulate every facet of your day to day life. Every bureaucrat added requires a salary which is paid for with your tax dollars and contributing nothing of material worth to the country other than implementing a Kafkaesque nightmare that grows every single year. <br><br>Tax is being used to construct a larger and larger dystopian government, rather than building up the country. <br>The first step to fixing this nightmare is to reduce taxes and the size of government. Any expansion of govt, no matter how idealistic the message it spews, will eventually result in the curtailing of liberties.","filename":"1436300937584","ext":".png","w":1111,"h":1482,"tn_w":187,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493701698100,"time":1493701698,"md5":"ffWlwPbdFrlIdf4GS2adTA==","fsize":4116331,"resto":0,"id":"vLaYJIl9","country":"AU","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"australia-is-literally-communist","country_name":"Australia","replies":4,"images":0,"unique_ips":1},{"no":123730325,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)01:08:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;5. Centralization of credit in the hands of the state, by means of a national bank with state capital and an exclusive monopoly.<\/span><br><br>The Reserve Bank of Australia, on 14 January 1960, became the Australian central bank and banknote issuing authority, when the Reserve Bank Act 1959 (23 April 1959) removed the central banking functions from the Commonwealth Bank.<br><br>It directly meets the criteria for a &quot;national bank&quot; and politically manipulates interest rates and holding a monopoly on legal counterfeiting in Australia. This is exactly what Marx had in mind and completely fulfills this plank, another major socialist objective. Yet, most Australians naively believe the country is far from a Marxist or socialist nation.<br><br>This would be a grave error to make. Alongside the ever increasing government bureaucratic nightmare, the fractional reserve banking system allows the manipulation of currency to remove wealth from the country and place it in the hands of a select few. No longer does the country have the right to manage it&#039;s own money, but now a private entity with shareholders and operating on the behalf of the American Federal Reserve.","time":1493701737,"resto":123730263,"id":"vLaYJIl9","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":123730390,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)01:09:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;6. Centralization of the means of communication and transportation in the hands of the state.<\/span><br><br>It is no coincidence that punishments for traffic related offenses are so obscenely harsh by comparison to the punishments handed out by our judges for violent crimes such as home invasions. The entire road safety agenda, in concert with the &quot;hoon laws&quot; were enacted as means to increase control over the means of transportation in Australia. <br><br>The Kafkaesque nightmare paid for by #2 can be directly witnessed in the licensing and registration system. Endless propaganda is spewed about how you need a license, you need to pay more tax and you need to comply with a litany of regulations to drive on the road &quot;safely&quot;. While some of these regulations are reasonable and we could agree with them, many are not and they intentionally are pairing the two together so you either agree with all of them or none. They attempt to silence debate on this issue using these tactics. <br><br>You will see propaganda implying that you support dangerous driving if you have a problem with the obscene police powers requiring no suspicion of a crime to stop and search you, a law abiding citizen. As you may be aware, these laws have fed into massive police corruption as the onus of guilt has now been reversed and you must prove your innocence. <br><br>Of course, when you dig into where the government is basing its road safety agenda on, you will notice that all their studies stem from a single research arm (MUARC). Dig a little more and you will find out MUARC depends on government funding to stay open and thus does not qualify as impartial research and is incredibly biased. &quot;Evidence&quot; indeed.","time":1493701773,"resto":123730263,"id":"vLaYJIl9","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":123730426,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)01:09:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;(2\/2) #6<\/span><br>https:\/\/www.monash.edu\/__data\/asset<wbr>s\/pdf_file\/0012\/214401\/miri2013.pdf<wbr><br>Note on page 8 how MUARC recieves grants from NHMRC and on page 9 how they recieved a ARC LEIF grant.

The only interviews he has given since that day were in front of a blacked out and\/or animated backgrounds. This leaves space for a couple of options:<br>1. He is still in the embassy, but doesn&#039;t want to make one of his Balcony appearances, out of fear he could get assassinated, since he is easily the most wanted man (alive).<br>2. He is alive, but not any longer in the Ecuadorian embassy. There is a theory that he was smuggled out on a plane with John Kerry.<br>3. He was murdered and the interviews conducted are fake.

The austrian socialists SDAP (social democratic workers party), led by Karl Renner, advertised heavily for a coalition with the NSDAP and the Anschluss (German annexion of Austria). They were opposed by the Christian-Socialists, led by Engelbert Dollfu\u00df who was the Chancellor at the time. After the Austrian civil war of 1933 between the paramilitaries of the SDAP and the Christian-Socialists, Dollfu\u00df banned the NSDAP, the SDAP, the Gro\u00dfdeutschepartei (Greater Germany party) and the Communists. This period was dubbed Austro-fascism. Socialists and National socialists started a coalition and socialists started to leave the party in favor of the NSDAP. Dollfu\u00df was assassinated in 1934 when the Nazis stormed the Hofburg (parliament). From then on the resistence against an annexion started fading and the new Christian-Socialist party leader Schuschnigg turned out to be too weak to oppose Hitler. Otto von Habsburg urged Schuschnigg to transfer power to his family and to start building an effective resistance against Germany. Schuschnigg refused, and in 1938 Austria got what it wanted, the Anschluss. After the war Karl Renner, the former most prominent proponent of the Anschluss, was voted the first Austrian president of the 2nd republic. Socialists today try to downplay their role in the 30s.","time":1492549840,"resto":121723152,"id":"ALqTtt7F","country":"AT","country_name":"Austria"},{"no":121741087,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)17:11:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121723152\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121723152<\/a><br>He&#039;s a terrorist.","filename":"36842B1B-6105-41FD-B7D3-5DA44D116B06-12014-00001BDD6419089A","ext":".jpg","w":797,"h":448,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1492549907061,"time":1492549907,"md5":"9ifbJjO7rQm34l67xrrQ4w==","fsize":31313,"resto":121723152,"id":"wsVAUyFf","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121741169,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)17:12:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121723152\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121723152<\/a><br>Anyone remember the blockchain threads?<br>I saw one or two start here before the people active decided it was better to change to a more robust medium.

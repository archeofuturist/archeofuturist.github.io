The only interviews he has given since that day were in front of a blacked out and\/or animated backgrounds. This leaves space for a couple of options:<br>1. He is still in the embassy, but doesn&#039;t want to make one of his Balcony appearances, out of fear he could get assassinated, since he is easily the most wanted man (alive).<br>2. He is alive, but not any longer in the Ecuadorian embassy. There is a theory that he was smuggled out on a plane with John Kerry.<br>3. He was murdered and the interviews conducted are fake.

A lot of them are white niggers, meaning they work without declaring anything and not paying any income tax while still benefiting State-funded funds. Those are the worst guys you can find on the island. A lot of them are idependentist, meaning they want to be secede from France and become a state. this is not relevant as Corsica alone would not be relevant at all and will get screwed in international trading as they produce almost nothing that can sell worldwide or even European Union-wide.<br>A lot of them though work hard and just live their life on their Island without fucking with no one and consider themselves both Corsican and French, but more Corsican. I can understand them as they speak another language (but their official language is still French, they&#039;re totally part of the state).<br>They have strong nationalist views and should be far-right (Le Pen) leaning in the upcoming election which would prove their baseness.

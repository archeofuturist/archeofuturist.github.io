We all fought in a war only cuz of these 2. But in 2008 albanians declared indenpendence with USA support and cuz USA is major power they make other countries to recognize it which doesn&#039;t mean nothing cuz the only relevant things come from 1999. We didnt lose it by military way but cuz Serbia was ruined in 1990s and she couldnt afford to be bombed 24\/7 next X years. KLA took 40% of kosovo&#039;s territory in july or august 1998 (mostly rural shitholes) and lost almost all of them next month. They held 10% of kosovo during most of the time. NATO-Albanian offensives failed on Kosare and in Operatio Strela. Slobo knew there will be a coup d&#039;etat against him if NATO continues bombing us so he made agreement with the enemies (agreement says that Kosovo is still Serbia). They just declared indenpendance with USA support and Serbian Army wasnt deployed on Kosovo and couldn&#039;t stop it. Later they have done things to look like de facto indenpendent country with US and NATO support. Albanians are nothing but lobbists and butt-licking(USA ass), cockaroach-bleeding subhumans. In 1913 Albania was made only cuz Serbia and Greece couldnt expand their territories (AU and GB supported albanians), in 1990s all they got is by USA help. You guys should also know they even funded Hillary&#039;s campaing, they also l got statue of Bill Clinton in Prishtina and the most elite boutique in Pristina is named &quot;Hillary Clinton&quot;.

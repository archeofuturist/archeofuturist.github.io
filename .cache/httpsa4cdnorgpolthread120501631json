As the blessed apostle says in his letter to the Ephesians, &#039;For we are members of His Body, of His flesh and of His bones&#039; (Eph. 5:30). He is not talking about some kind of &#039;spiritual&#039; and &#039;invisible&#039; man, &#039;for a spirit does not have flesh an bones&#039; (Lk. 24:39). No, he is talking of the organism possessed by a real human being, composed of flesh and nerves and bones. It is this which is nourished by the cup which is His Blood, and is fortified by the bread which is His Body. The stem of the vine takes root in the earth and eventually bears fruit, and &#039;the grain of wheat falls into the earth&#039; (Jn. 12:24), dissolves, rises again, multiplied by the all-containing Spirit of God, and finally after skilled processing, is put to human use.

He commanded us to celebrate sacrifices and services, and that it should not be thoughtlessly or disorderly, but at fixed times and hours. He has Himself fixed by His supreme will the places and persons whom He desires for these celebrations, in order that all things may be done piously according to His good pleasure, and be acceptable to His will. So then those who offer their oblations at the appointed seasons are acceptable and blessed, but they follow the laws of the Master and do not sin.

Le Pen is good on nationalism; Macron is a fucking wreck on that. <br><br>If I was French, I would probably not vote. Or maybe I&#039;d just vote for Le Pen to say &#039;fuck you&#039; to the establishment and because I hate Macron&#039;s personality. Neither candidates will solve France&#039;s troubles, so what the heck might as well make the right people angry with who you choose.<br><br>If Le Pen was more liberal in her economic policies I would be so behind her. She&#039;s socialistic, and France right now is fucked in that regard. France needs a Thatcher. Fillon was the closest to that. He had the strong economic policies and seemed pretty based on Islam. I read his book on Islamic totalitarianism. I wasn&#039;t in favour of his pro-EU stance, but better to have someone not cucked manning the ship. <br><br>A deep shame he was thrown off because the media attacked him with the fake jobs scandal (details of which allegedly originated within government). They paved the way for Macron, and they&#039;re just about to get what they want...sad, very sad.<br><br>I&#039;m not sure how well France will fare over the next few years. Hopefully though, the demographics of France will not change dramatically meaning perhaps more will move towards supporting uncucked candidates. <br><br>If not, then R.I.P. to one of the greatest nations in the world. I don&#039;t say this lightly since I have an extreme attachment to France, but I think it will be the canary in the coal mine.","time":1493573696,"resto":123500757,"id":"55kclb3T","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123501548,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)13:36:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123500757\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123500757<\/a><br>Macron:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Married to Skeletor<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Keeps shitting on French people<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Rothschild banker<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Obama and Fillon back him<\/span><br>Le Pen:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Needs Melenchon&#039;s voters<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Far leftists don&#039;t think beyond RIGHT NOW even if they&#039;re anti-EU<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Le Pen is a really good rabble-rouser<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Sandniggers<\/span>","time":1493573768,"resto":123500757,"id":"BGGqyIYq","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123501570,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)13:36:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123501410\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123501410<\/a><br>Not voting is always a mistake.","time":1493573781,"resto":123500757,"id":"WKhhRu7B","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":123501995,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)13:40:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123501410\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123501410<\/a><br>You know, a lot of left nationalists become pro-free market after they become leaders.","time":1493574041,"resto":123500757,"id":"903KrVl4","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":123503763,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)13:57:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"I mean after seeing cucklord trudeau 2.0 macro with his &quot;wife&#039;s kids&quot; I really Dont know what to say.","time":1493575024,"resto":123500757,"id":"OzsAiy8D","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123503833,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)13:57:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123500757\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123500757<\/a><br>growing","time":1493575059,"resto":123500757,"id":"TgNPMp3Z","country":"BE","country_name":"Belgium"},{"no":123503950,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)13:58:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"In this (((System)))?

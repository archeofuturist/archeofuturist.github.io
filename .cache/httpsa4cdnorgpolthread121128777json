Unfortunately these sunni salafists are bad news.. assads worst crime is really that he is backed by\/friendly towards iran. He&#039;s an alawite muslim and has been protecting a pretty substantial christian minority in syria. If the sunni salafist take over there, it&#039;s going to be a different situation.

That&#039;s about it.<br><br>The sunni &quot;rebels&quot; have been found to use chemical weapons to blame it on assad since they want him gone\/they want to replace him with one of their own. And since the aforementioned are also interested in assad being replaced, they essentially help them peddle that narrative, same as they do with arming them etc. <br><br>Pic related is from video of the &quot;white helmets&quot; who operate in jihadi territory staging a guy being hurt by chemicals or some nonsense, they start filming, then stop.

Trump does side with israel<\/span><br>Israel wants assad replaced with a more pro israel puppet and drag the sunnis into that. <br><br>Since the syrians don&#039;t want assad gone israel has been playing a very dirty game allowing these salafist to run around and eventually starting a conflict with assad. <br><br>Trump has said he wants to destroy ISIS and doesn&#039;t want to pursue regime change in syria but the sunni constellation along with israel is ofcourse trying to push trump into getting rid of assad. Because to them it&#039;s about iran and hezbollah being a threat, not assad per se. Israel see&#039;s assad as an iranian puppet for being nicer to them than the sunni states. And ofcourse the sunnis who don&#039;t like shias or iran very much and feeling is mutual, ofcourse are quick to agree with them that assad must go and replaced by a sunni puppet.<br><br>The &quot;chemical attack&quot; was bait to try to trick trump to go all in against assad, which he has recently come out and said he don&#039;t want to do. <br><br>So the question remains will trump do the right thing in this situation and settle for crushing the sunni salafist groups and let assad stay? Israel and the sunnis clearly won&#039;t be happy unless assad is replaced. due to what they percieve to be iranian influence over him.<br><br>Welcome to the bullshit sectarian strife that exists in islamic nations.. <br><br>Anyways hope it makes a little more sense to you what&#039;s going on than it did before.","time":1492218810,"resto":121128777,"id":"\/ChbUiWp","country":"DK","country_name":"Denmark"},{"no":121145763,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)21:15:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121128777\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121128777<\/a><br><br>Because they bent the knee.<br><br>You haven&#039;t noticed that their tone has changed?

With assad and the syrian population stuck in the middle. And russia picking the side of assad because they are not interested in destabilizing syria and risking it turning into another iraq\/afghanistan\/libya.

You do not get a &quot;reformer,&quot; unless the establishment itself has a large faction that wants reform.

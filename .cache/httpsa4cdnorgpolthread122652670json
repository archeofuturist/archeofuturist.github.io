Why haven&#039;t we tried the same with something semi-popular like, say, Lord of the Rings?

Now before you say &quot;Well we don&#039;t think of everything in terms of pop culture&quot;, this isn&#039;t for us. Normies and kids do think of everything in terms of pop culture.

Leftist BS is just prominent in many schools. The thing is, we&#039;d have to redesign everything. I think the right is too tainted to be &quot;cool&quot; in the US because liberal is associated with progress and the cool new shit while conservative is considered old money and old people, not hip, the old way. Literally a third party would have to rise out of nowhere with incredible memes and a really logical approach to society based on fact much like the right, but not actually called the right. Basically the fun and happiness in appearance on the surface that the left has, and only science and facts once you dive into the beliefs.","time":1493075168,"resto":122652670,"id":"07iMnK\/E","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122653726,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)19:08:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122653409\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122653409<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Literally a third party would have to rise out of nowhere with incredible memes and a really logical approach to society based on fact much like the right, but not actually called the right.

You get the point. It&#039;s hard to tell teens\/young adults &quot;Hey kids, forget having fun and doing all the things that teenagers think is cool, be conservative!&quot; Especially when all the &quot;cool&quot; people act like animals which leads to the root of the problem:<br><br>Entertainment. Western entertainment glorifies hedonistic behavior and endless self indulgence. Individualism through capitalism\/reckless spending. What the kids need is some quality role models.

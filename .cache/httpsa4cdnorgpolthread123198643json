The fact that individualism is now disappearing due to mass movements and consumerism isn&#039;t a bad thing. Inidividualism itself was a reaction to and negation of the earlier, Traditional system of types and persons. To put it briefly: &quot;person&quot; comes from the Latin &quot;persona,&quot; which describes the mask an actor wore. Each being in a Traditional system presented himself to the world as a person, while sub specie interioratis his own being linked him to the transcendent. His person gave him a type, and this is linked to a concept which still exists vestigially among popes and kings, in which such people adopt a new name and identity upon being invested with spiritual or temporal authority. Thus in an organic system in which each part moves in tandem to form a cogent body, a multitude of persons existed, but not individuals. The concept of individual is a measure of quantity. An individual is one faceless numerical unit among others, and an individual can in no way integrate his own being or approach the transcendent and move beyond the contingencies of daily life. We are concerned with quality, not quantity.","filename":"IMG_5826","ext":".jpg","w":363,"h":501,"tn_w":90,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493391043550,"time":1493391043,"md5":"esWFNPAD2ZgMGid5sByRdQ==","fsize":32114,"resto":123198643,"id":"z8H3d+rq","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123202168,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)10:51:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123201609\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123201609<\/a><br>Lavey Satanism is redpilled<br>he also believed in social darwinism","time":1493391085,"resto":123198643,"id":"EcWc8fxY","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":123202277,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)10:52:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123202091\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123202091<\/a><br><br>Interioris not interioratis","time":1493391153,"resto":123198643,"id":"z8H3d+rq","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123202294,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)10:52:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123201750\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123201750<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I habitually read that as &quot;I&#039;d gas her&quot;<\/span><br><br>We all have goals and dreams.","time":1493391160,"resto":123198643,"id":"YDeqMn3s","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":123202379,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)10:53:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123201757\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123201757<\/a><br>atlas shrugged is cringeworthy<br>havent read anything else<br>this idiotic thinking is just as bad as the marxists","time":1493391210,"resto":123198643,"id":"ttsjTUzo","country":"CL","country_name":"Chile"},{"no":123202382,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)10:53:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123198643\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123198643<\/a><br>The nuclear family should be the smallest unit of society, not the individual.<br><br>Appealing to the individual is how many of these selfish libertarian ideals rose to popularity.

She was fairly hypocritical and I lost a lot of respect for her because of that.<br><br>I&#039;ve read Anthem and The Fountainhead. I really enjoyed both of them.

You can have your own opinions and don&#039;t have to match up with a conservative or liberal platform completely.<br><br>3) Don&#039;t read and accept, read and think. This applies to these books as well. I&#039;m not dumb enough to believe that objectivism and a lassez-faire capitalistic state would work. But too often people will read something and just regurgitate it as their own beliefs before they even stop to think about it for a second.<br><br>4) Non-conformists are just as bad, if not worst than conformists. Because they are just as equally affected by society and also happen to be annoying little pity seeking fucks.<br><br>5) Being selfish isn&#039;t a bad thing. Everyone just makes it seem like a bad thing and guilt trips you. Once you get past the idea that being selfish is bad then you&#039;ll be a lot happier and probably more successful. <br><br>6) Fuck communism, socialism, normies, and fuckers who dye their hair rainbow colors. <br><br>I would encourage anyone to read Anthem for a quick read or The Fountainhead if you have the time.

The fact that individualism is now disappearing due to mass movements and consumerism isn&#039;t a bad thing. Inidividualism itself was a reaction to and negation of the earlier, Traditional system of types and persons. To put it briefly: &quot;person&quot; comes from the Latin &quot;persona,&quot; which describes the mask an actor wore. Each being in a Traditional system presented himself to the world as a person, while sub specie interioratis his own being linked him to the transcendent. His person gave him a type, and this is linked to a concept which still exists vestigially among popes and kings, in which such people adopt a new name and identity upon being invested with spiritual or temporal authority. Thus in an organic system in which each part moves in tandem to form a cogent body, a multitude of persons existed, but not individuals. The concept of individual is a measure of quantity. An individual is one faceless numerical unit among others, and an individual can in no way integrate his own being or approach the transcendent and move beyond the contingencies of daily life. We are concerned with quality, not quantity.","filename":"IMG_5826","ext":".jpg","w":363,"h":501,"tn_w":90,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493391043550,"time":1493391043,"md5":"esWFNPAD2ZgMGid5sByRdQ==","fsize":32114,"resto":123198643,"id":"z8H3d+rq","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123202168,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)10:51:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123201609\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123201609<\/a><br>Lavey Satanism is redpilled<br>he also believed in social darwinism","time":1493391085,"resto":123198643,"id":"EcWc8fxY","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":123202277,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)10:52:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123202091\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123202091<\/a><br><br>Interioris not interioratis","time":1493391153,"resto":123198643,"id":"z8H3d+rq","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123202294,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)10:52:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123201750\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123201750<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I habitually read that as &quot;I&#039;d gas her&quot;<\/span><br><br>We all have goals and dreams.","time":1493391160,"resto":123198643,"id":"YDeqMn3s","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":123202379,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)10:53:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123201757\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123201757<\/a><br>atlas shrugged is cringeworthy<br>havent read anything else<br>this idiotic thinking is just as bad as the marxists","time":1493391210,"resto":123198643,"id":"ttsjTUzo","country":"CL","country_name":"Chile"},{"no":123202382,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)10:53:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123198643\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123198643<\/a><br>The nuclear family should be the smallest unit of society, not the individual.<br><br>Appealing to the individual is how many of these selfish libertarian ideals rose to popularity.

If our speeches are shut down, shouldn&#039;t we shut theirs down too?

Stick around afterward to get into an argument with some leftists.<br><br>Or you can do what I&#039;m going to do. I&#039;m just going to start reading a children&#039;s book out loud and try to prevent any of the speeches from taking place. I&#039;m not sure how it will work.

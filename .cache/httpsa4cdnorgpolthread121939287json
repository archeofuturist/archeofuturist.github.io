Simply attend quietly while wearing a MAGA hat. It will at least break the unanimity.<br>2. Hand out flyers with infographs on them.<br>3. Heckle the speakers with alternative information.<br>4.

We cannot ignore issues of racism, sexism, homophobia, ableism, xenophobia, or any other form of discrimination in the discussion and implementation of science. Nor can we ignore the ways in which science has been misused to harm marginalized communities.

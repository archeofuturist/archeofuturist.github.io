The justices voted 5-4 to reject an emergency application brought by several inmates before Arkansas executed convicted murderer Ledell Lee.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Lee&#039;s lethal injection for the 1993 beating death of Debra Reese was the only one carried out so far by the state this month, despite an original plan to execute eight inmates in April before its supply of one of the three drugs used expires.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Kent Scheidegger, a lawyer with the pro-prosecution Criminal Justice Legal Foundation, said Gorsuch is &quot;not one who will further delay justice when it has already been badly delayed merely because the lawyers for a death row inmate bring weak claims at the last minute.&quot;<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The court has rejected stays for the eight men, including Lee. Their lawyers have argued that Arkansas&#039; rush to the death chamber amounted to cruel and unusual punishment, and violated the inmates&#039; right to counsel and their right to access the courts and counsel during the execution process. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Gorsuch&#039;s vote could again be crucial next week when Arkansas plans to execute three more inmates. On Monday, the state will try to put two inmates to death on the same day, something that has not been done in the United States in 17 years. Arkansas also plans a single execution for Thursday. <\/span><br><br>http:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-a<wbr>rkansas-execution-idUSKBN17N1IO","filename":"s2.reutersmedia.net","ext":".jpg","w":701,"h":468,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1492814116912,"time":1492814116,"md5":"MIGC9\/rJJm5Ox+TArEU3gA==","fsize":26752,"resto":0,"id":"aEqYeJWv","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"gorsuch-rules-in-favor-of-death-penalty","country_name":"United States","replies":3,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":122196650,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)18:39:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122196188\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122196188<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;5-4 splits<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;every time<\/span><br><br>I&#039;m pretty fucking sick of this shit. <br>I hate how the SCOTUS has become so political. <br>It&#039;s fucking words, interpret the god damn words of the law","time":1492814351,"resto":122196188,"id":"HoSJZh\/j","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122197214,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)18:44:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122196650\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122196650<\/a><br><br>Many parts of the constitution are pretty vague.

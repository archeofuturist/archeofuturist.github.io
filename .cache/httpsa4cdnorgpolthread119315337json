Meaning Europe will not be saved until all of the volk reunite under the LORD, and cast out the non-believers.

One: he uses Christianity as a counterpoint to communism, i.e. he is distancing himself from communism this way, although I&#039;d be happier if he sacked the second-tier leaders of the communist regime who are now close advisors of Fidesz. Two: &quot;christian&quot; in hungarian political parlance means &quot;non-Jew&quot; more often than not (the majority of the population, yes, a majority of those 80 effective atheists, is rabidly antisemitic and racist\/anti-gypsy, it&#039;s just that we make an effort not to seem to understand why would this be a problem).Three: he&#039;s in coalition with the Christian Democratic People&#039;s Party (KDNP), an infinitesimal group of lunatics and the only nominally christian party in Hungary, who never ever got more than 1% of total votes here when campaigning alone, but a coalition of two parties is a coalition of two parties, getting twice as many committee seats etc., regardless of size. But for this reason Orban has to make christian noises time to time.<br><br>From the particular region where I come from, everyone pretty much is an atheist but deadly afraid of showing it in little matters. This is because religion in that part of the country functioned as a proxy for ethnicity for centuries (it is documented from the 1600&#039;s and I still saw it working with my own eyes): calvinist = hungarian, catholic = (hungarized) german (die Schwaben, natuerlich), orthodox = romanian. The history of ethnic\/religious strife is such that by now it is tacitly understood that 1) we don&#039;t discuss religion, we don&#039;t even show it in everyday business (I was 30 years old before I saw an adult praying in public, and that was in North Carolina), but 2) it is also understood that staying outside any group means all groups will trample you, so formally everyone claims to belong to a church; I even &quot;converted&quot; to Calvinism from Greek Catholic for this very reason.","time":1491218766,"resto":119315337,"id":"4u\/HFZiu","country":"HU","country_name":"Hungary"},{"no":119317737,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)07:27:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119317051\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119317051<\/a><br>That&#039;s accurate.

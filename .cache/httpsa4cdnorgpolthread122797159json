If it&#039;s a religious garment that they choose to wear, I don&#039;t see an issue. It&#039;s not like France where there&#039;s a rather large Muslim population with Muslim communities where these can be enforced.","time":1493164795,"resto":122797159,"id":"Y2XsO\/O2","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122810772,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)20:04:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122797159\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122797159<\/a><br>Honestly, these Baltic countries that are still so white should just ban shitskins period.

At least you weren&#039;t seriously arguing in favour of them.<br><br>I appreciate the principle of your position (freedom of expression and religion and all that), but I can&#039;t accept it in practice.

Some religious and cultural influences are just plain bad. Somalian women may choose to undergo female genital mutilation because it makes them cleaner and more wholesome by their culture&#039;s standards, but I&#039;d support a ban on it in my country in a heartbeat. Burkas are of course a less extreme example, but I draw the line at outside cultural influences that actively harm women or their ability to participate meaningfully in society.","time":1493165879,"resto":122797159,"id":"eFi51\/Am","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122812667,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)20:19:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122798706\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122798706<\/a><br>Alright, Achmed.

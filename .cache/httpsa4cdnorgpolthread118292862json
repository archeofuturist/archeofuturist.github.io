Most know that real, meaningful relationships are probably better in the long run but they can&#039;t resist acting like that.

It&#039;s just an easy way to make some quick cash for a lot of girls (and it&#039;s safer than before, they can verify their client online a bit and log the encounter).

You get the woman addicted, and when they can no longer afford their habit you tell them you know a quick way for them to make a buck. From then on you simply make sure that they only ever have enough money to afford their drug habit, and never ever enough money to save for a better life...

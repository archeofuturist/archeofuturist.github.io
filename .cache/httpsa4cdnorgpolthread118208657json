This is because walmart commands such a share of the market that if they refuse to carry your product then your business is as good as fucked. This gives walmart massive leveraging power and the ability to name its own price. To be able to stay competitive and to be able to still make a profit, companies will lessen the quality of a product or maybe remove a component from the product so it will cost less to manufacture and can be sold to Walmart for the amount walmart is offering and still turn a profit. The end result being, buying a product from Walmart and buying the same exact product from a place like Krogers can leave you with two different versions of the same branded product.","filename":"jew_trap","ext":".jpg","w":422,"h":751,"tn_w":70,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490436926176,"time":1490436926,"md5":"iFLCxZb2maPq2bLB1XQyNQ==","fsize":47838,"resto":118208657,"id":"Vw+nEinr","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118210931,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)06:16:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118208657\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118208657<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Liha-pyorykka<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Medwurst Meetvursti<\/span><br>Holy shit they&#039;re literally just making up words to distract their population from the fact that their nation is crumbling into dust and soon there won&#039;t even be bones for the sand niggers to pick.","time":1490436983,"resto":118208657,"id":"LCkfhOJH","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118211052,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)06:18:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118209386\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118209386<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;no boneless chicken<\/span><br>Socialism strikes again.","time":1490437104,"resto":118208657,"id":"7qjmZbJe","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118211224,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)06:20:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118210790\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118210790<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;spit take<\/span><br><br>SOAP LICENSES????

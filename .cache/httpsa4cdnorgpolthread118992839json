I said something similar in the leftist thread, but i&#039;ll tweak it here. <br>It isn&#039;t that the left is ideologically bankrupt. in fact, the left has have created tons of ideas, schemes and ideologies over the last century which should be poached from. If you&#039;re implying though that Democrats are somehow less ambitious than Republicans, you&#039;re totally off the mark and are just stating your perception of things and not statistics. But politically, I think the major problem of the left is a lack of leadership; and thats because, as you say, nobody wants to put in the effort to build party organizations, politick and so on and so forth. The Left (and the Media in general) are also moralistic to a fault, so that any kind of personal failings or gaffes by democrats (and republicans too) is seen as a fatal blow to one&#039;s reputation. Except, it&#039;s not. Trump, to his credit, proved how ridiculous that idea is. I wouldn&#039;t call it political correctness, just an excessive concern for proper conduct which can be found on both sides (for example, rick perry messing up naming the departments he wanted to cut). That I think is a legacy of protestantism on the one hand, and the excessive scrutiny brought by technology, namely the oligarchic corporate media and anarchic groupthink of social media. In the past, most faults of politicians were pretty much concealed. FDR&#039;s and JFK&#039;s problems came to light only many decades after their deaths. Even if politicians did have problems, they were ignored or played down out of reverence for the political process. This exists no longer in the US, but until recently this was the way things worked in France, until Sarkozy, Dominique Strauss Kahn, Hollande and others took it too far, or because the panopticon nature of our technology has now made it impossible to cover up faults even in a system where it was once accepted.","time":1490905216,"resto":118992839,"country":"XX","country_name":"Unknown"},{"no":118992848,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)16:21:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118992839\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118992839<\/a><br>We just don&#039;t buy into the capitalist definition of ambition and success.","time":1490905307,"resto":118992839,"country":"XX","country_name":"Unknown"},{"no":118992849,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)16:24:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118992839\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118992839<\/a><br>This knee deep in pure ideology<br>Mein gott!

I suspect most aren&#039;t encouraged to pursue a political career anymore except sociopaths, ideologues or people controlled by paid interests (think Marco Rubio, who never really had a job until a car mogul manufactured him into a hard conservative politician). The parties as they stand are pretty corrupt and bankrupted and their organizations hierarchical, nepotistic and swollen with lobbyists and party bureaucrats looking to preserve their interests or get in on the spoils of funding. The parties are so ossified that Trump was able to outmaneuver him. I believe that Trump isn&#039;t smart or qualified, but unlike other politicians he was a master of optics, having honed his skills from over three decades of being in the public eye. Basically what we need is a Trump with actual thinking skills (i suspect some here will disagree). But a politician with the traits of the fox and the lion we lack. And I believe this lack is because people are 1) as i said too moralistic to join corrupt parties (as they always have been) 2) the best and brightest (though i have doubts about an elite of ubermensch ruling over the mass brainlets because muh equality) are funneled into the private sector, namely the tech industry, science or the media and 3) because, as much as i dont like zealots, especially of the kind in the Republican party, I think there needs to be politicians who are true believers in a better ideology than now exists, and pursue their goals with zeal, whatever it takes (conservatives as you imply OP seem to have a very motivated class of fanatic politicians, though I think their ideology is incoherent, harmful to most and mainly pushed by big business) .","time":1490906253,"resto":118992839,"country":"XX","country_name":"Unknown"},{"no":118992851,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)16:40:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"They&#039;re usually genetic defectives or ugly traps.","time":1490906403,"resto":118992839,"country":"XX","country_name":"Unknown"},{"no":118992852,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)16:42:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"This is a big generalization, but I&#039;ve noticed the left tends to hate qualities like success, ambition, strength, beauty, purity and ability.

So why have the unions weakened? imo bad leadership, ossified organizations, some corruption and the plummeting of factory labor, where it&#039;s easier to organize. Besides that, the Union movement will only ever be strong, as I see it, if the working class is faced with total immiseration. But productivity gains and government benefits mean that nowadays a worker is always secure in food, and possibly in housing and personal finance. Conditions are simply not as desperate as they used to be, and so with the basics secure the working class is free to flirt with ideologies that fit their cultural outlook, namely racism and other things vilified by the liberal democrats.","time":1490908610,"resto":118992839,"country":"XX","country_name":"Unknown"},{"no":118992861,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)17:19:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118992843\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118992843<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;and anyone with a philosophy like yours was probably born on top and doesn&#039;t know what it&#039;s like to be spit on by nepotists that think they&#039;re hot shit because their parents made them everything that they are.<\/span><br><br>You sound pretty salty.","time":1490908742,"resto":118992839,"country":"XX","country_name":"Unknown"},{"no":118992862,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)17:20:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118992839\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118992839<\/a><br>?<br><br>Elon Musk is only able to do what he is doing thanks to these &quot;unambitious commies&quot; as you put it.","filename":"Space_Race_1957-1975_black_text (1)","ext":".png","w":1350,"h":1080,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":100,"tim":1490908848802,"time":1490908848,"md5":"68QKLdwPskZs+zSjNN925w==","fsize":398839,"resto":118992839,"country":"XX","country_name":"Unknown"},{"no":118992863,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)17:23:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"Yeah they&#039;re low energy and low test.","time":1490908994,"resto":118992839,"country":"XX","country_name":"Unknown"},{"no":118992864,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)17:24:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"16 \u201cSo the last will be first, and the first will be last.\u201d","time":1490909068,"resto":118992839,"country":"XX","country_name":"Unknown"},{"no":118992865,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)17:25:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118992846\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118992846<\/a><br>yes it is troubling. to be leftist nowadays is to be artsy, impractical, emotional and intolerant of anything outside their arbitrary standards (though the right has this last problem too).

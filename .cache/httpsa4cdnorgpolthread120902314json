Time is on the side of the WPK.<br><br>The only reason why southern Korea has survived for as long as they have is that their bubble economy is propped up by American trade deals that disenfranchise US workers. Once the economic advantage is gone, the legitimacy of the southern Korean state will be hard to justify. Why should a seperate pro-US state exist, when there is a &quot;Korea First&quot; state right across the border?<br><br>The so-called &quot;Dae Han Min Guk&quot; is fundamentally a unstable nation-state, the &quot;citizens&quot; have very little pride in it. The southern Koreans are proud of their race but they are ashamed of their state, which they view as a puppet state. That&#039;s why there are millions of people protesting Park Geun Hye, there are millions of people importing the import of US beef, burning American effiges, rioting against US military presence, there are millions protesting when a south Korean school girl gets run over by an American tank. Yet when there is an anti-DPRK protest there are only 30 people, mostly old veterans, one foot in the grave already. The future belongs to the anti-American, pro-Korean youth of Korea that will be the generation of unification.

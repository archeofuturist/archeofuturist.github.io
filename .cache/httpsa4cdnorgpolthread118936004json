If they want more money, they should just get a better job. Not have some socialist program bestowing upon them what hasn&#039;t been rightfully earned. Whether it&#039;s a job, a house, or even cash. Any time you earn something without working hard enough for it is pure socialism. And the fact it&#039;s usually millennials who working these jobs, who have these entitlement complexes, who don&#039;t understand that everything in life is earned not given, highlights the inherent Marxism behind tipping as a whole. And it flabbergasts me that it&#039;s still so pervasive.","filename":"tipping","ext":".jpg","w":1240,"h":775,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":156,"tim":1490890716426,"time":1490890716,"md5":"H\/+X6ExJ51iYGDgaklSLww==","fsize":142574,"resto":0,"id":"iPE9V4PS","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"is-there-a-more-socialist-practice-than-tipping","country_name":"United States","replies":10,"images":1,"unique_ips":6},{"no":118936601,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)12:24:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118936004\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118936004<\/a><br>Hey dumbass.<br><br>Those workers are earning *less than minumum wage*.<br><br>If you fail to tip them, they earn *less than minimum wage*.<br><br>Tipping helps ensure good service.

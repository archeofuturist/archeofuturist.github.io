It also shows atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations are an insignificant player, and possibly a non-player, in climate change. <br>globalwarmingsolved.com\/data_files\/<wbr>SCC2015_prep... <br><br>They used northern hemisphere data from 1880 to 2014. They used data, not theories, to make their case. <br><br>First, they constructed the best possible temperature record from 1880 to 2014. Remarkably, no one had ever done this before. This required using only surface temperature data from stations not affected by a changing environment. <br><br>They show their temperature record is compatible with temperature trends derived from sea surface temperatures, glacier length records, and tree-ring widths. <br><br>Their corrected \u201ccomposite\u201d temperature record shows warming from the 1880\u2019s to 1940\u2019s, and from the 1980\u2019s to 2000\u2019s, with a cooling period from the 1950\u2019s to 1970\u2019s. The record shows the current warm period is similar to the previous warm period from the 1880\u2019s to 1940\u2019s. <br><br>They show climate models do not reproduce the correct temperature record when back tested. This means, of course, climate models are of no value in making climate predictions. The reason is obvious. Climate models do not properly simulate the physical effects of carbon dioxide, water vapor, clouds, aerosols, and solar irradiance. <br><br>This study has been out for 2 years and you cant find a single mainstream source reporting on it.","filename":"hqdefault (2)","ext":".jpg","w":480,"h":360,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1493242395275,"time":1493242395,"md5":"OxkczVc7LIOxR2v7ay7OGQ==","fsize":21406,"resto":0,"id":"U+mTHQi6","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"man-made-climate-change-is-not-real","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":122942972,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)17:34:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"Fucked up the source<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; http:\/\/globalwarmingsolved.com\/data<wbr>_files\/SCC2015_preprint.pdf<\/span>","time":1493242470,"resto":122942792,"id":"U+mTHQi6","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122944838,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)17:49:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"downloaded","time":1493243345,"resto":122942792,"id":"u50oHxvz","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"}]}

We live in a constitutional republic that is supposed to be composed of responsible citizen soldiers. We are supposed to defend the country from the dangers of a corrupted government and act as a check against tyranny. I know this concept is hard for europeans to comprehend. this is why you guys have become servile scum, and we are being dragged into the abyss with you. We should never have entangled ourselves with you guys like we have been doing for many many years.<br><br>If you take away a citizens voice, and his means of defending himself, you have made him voiceless and toothless. He is no longer an active member of the commonwealth and has become a ward of the state.<br><br>Problem is now our citizens cannot always be trusted with guns. We have become servile and irresponsible. My question though is are we supposed to solve this problem with more government intervention? Do we sacrifice all freedoms for comfort and safety? Do you not see that by cutting away at our freedoms, you are creating dependent and weak citizens? You cannot legislate these kinds of problems away, since they are problems of the heart. We need an awakening in this country.","time":1491979336,"resto":120724704,"id":"Ba9YaLx9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120725551,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)02:45:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"No guns in Britain is actually a bit of a meme.<br><br>I live in a village and I regularly hear shotguns going off in a nearby field, plus several gun clubs are just a half an hour to an hour drive.<br><br>I know people who do pest control and target shooting, a few have AR15 type rifles in .22 but some have a straight pull in bigger chambers.<br><br>Many have the old Lee Enfields etc.<br><br>Just joining a gun club or doing pest control are fine reasons.<br><br>Shotguns on the other hand are super easy to get licences for, just no criminal record pretty much, no reason required (but police like to hear what you want to do).<br><br>No it isn&#039;t the United States, but the gun laws in Britain are extremely over-exaggerated.<br><br>Still shit by my personal standards though.","filename":"2-1-696x468","ext":".jpg","w":696,"h":468,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":84,"tim":1491979553625,"time":1491979553,"md5":"RFrf9NzrpYvyHHztQUbndQ==","fsize":48150,"resto":120724704,"id":"QorJQSwn","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120725749,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)02:48:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120724704\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120724704<\/a><br>don&#039;t need a reason, it&#039;s my right you degenerate subhuman pajeet.","time":1491979680,"resto":120724704,"id":"kIavsguV","country":"CH","country_name":"Switzerland"},{"no":120725804,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)02:48:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120725551\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120725551<\/a><br>Any rifle above a 22 has to be bolt action <br>Also, to my knowledge you guys can&#039;t carry a handgun on you for any reason whatsoever, especially lethal force for self defense <br>Not to sound like a dick because you seem like a nice fella but you&#039;re cucked to shit m8","time":1491979712,"resto":120724704,"id":"03irUnYC","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120726085,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)02:52:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120724704\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120724704<\/a><br>For killing the invaders when your government fails to.","time":1491979929,"resto":120724704,"id":"uMeUBn8z","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120726190,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)02:53:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120724704\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120724704<\/a><br>having guns is good, they strike fear into the heart of the common nigger and thus reduces crime.<br><br>since guns were restricted to the citizens here, the crime rate skyrocketed.","time":1491980020,"resto":120724704,"id":"dDiBiEwc","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":120726302,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)02:55:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120724704\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120724704<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;inb4 muh constitution and muh defence against a tyrannical government<\/span><br>thats literally one of the best arguments for it you stupid cuck faggot<br><br><br>remember that last time america had a dictator who used death squads to kill massive amounts of political rivals and rounded up people into death camps? you dont? wonder why it happened in pretty much every european country though","time":1491980110,"resto":120724704,"id":"nb74GCMT","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120726467,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)02:57:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120725804\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120725804<\/a><br><br>UK in general?

No, what shitbirds are truly afraid of is armed citizens. You cannot victimize someone when everyone is armed and will kill you on the spot if you attempt to fuck them over. I&#039;d rather trust an armed nation to decide what is right or wrong over a very minuscule armed force given power by the Government to control all weapons who cannot be in the right place at the right time and. God forbidding, turn on the population because of orders up high. <br><br>Any Government that fears armed citizens is guilty and knows that their position would not stand if left in the hands of the people.","filename":"34563457","ext":".jpg","w":3264,"h":2448,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1491982758312,"time":1491982758,"md5":"c99ZfVDtOTe1Jw6cTtgRIQ==","fsize":1887240,"resto":120724704,"id":"Zs9h7\/Q5","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":120729785,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)03:41:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120727070\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120727070<\/a><br>fucking this right here","time":1491982864,"resto":120724704,"id":"qjrY3hVU","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120729907,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)03:42:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120724704\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120724704<\/a><br>You&#039;re an arrogant AND short sighted son of a bitch if you think you&#039;re absolutely confident that your government will never become tyrannical anytime between now and the heat death of the universe.","time":1491982960,"resto":120724704,"id":"Wy0BkHNF","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120729986,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)03:43:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120724704\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120724704<\/a><br>They don&#039;t happen frequently.

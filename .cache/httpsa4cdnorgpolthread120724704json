We live in a constitutional republic that is supposed to be composed of responsible citizen soldiers. We are supposed to defend the country from the dangers of a corrupted government and act as a check against tyranny. I know this concept is hard for europeans to comprehend. this is why you guys have become servile scum, and we are being dragged into the abyss with you. We should never have entangled ourselves with you guys like we have been doing for many many years.<br><br>If you take away a citizens voice, and his means of defending himself, you have made him voiceless and toothless. He is no longer an active member of the commonwealth and has become a ward of the state.<br><br>Problem is now our citizens cannot always be trusted with guns. We have become servile and irresponsible. My question though is are we supposed to solve this problem with more government intervention? Do we sacrifice all freedoms for comfort and safety? Do you not see that by cutting away at our freedoms, you are creating dependent and weak citizens? You cannot legislate these kinds of problems away, since they are problems of the heart. We need an awakening in this country.","time":1491979336,"resto":120724704,"id":"Ba9YaLx9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

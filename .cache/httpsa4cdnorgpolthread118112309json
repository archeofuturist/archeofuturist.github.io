If I&#039;m the only producer of soda, if I try profiteering off of my monopoly, another competitor would gladly come to undercut me. Not to mention the fact that I would still face real competition from substitutes like water, juice, or tea.<br><br>Second, cartels are not efficient, what I said earlier applies, a competitor would gladly rise up to undercut them and satisfy the demand they were not meeting. Cartels if not given power by the government typically dissolve on their own.<br><br>Third, the form of monopoly that is negative and hurts society is the government assisted monopoly, because they are backed by the entity with a monopoly on the use of force. Most monopolies do not come into existence without the government&#039;s assistance. Things like tariffs, subsidies, grants, are what help create monopolies.<br><br>Fourth, regulations create monopolies. The government imposes regulations on businesses that limit supply and competition all the time. Take for example minimum wages, they don&#039;t hurt Wal-Mart, they hurt Wal-Mart&#039;s competitors and makes it easier for it to dominate the market.<br><br>Fifth, anti-trust laws do not work. Take for example the case of The United States vs. ALCOA, where the government punished a business that was out competing all of its competitors and providing cheap aluminum to consumers.

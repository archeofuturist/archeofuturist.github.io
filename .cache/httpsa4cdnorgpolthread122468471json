It will be another 4 years in which we will see how the balkanization of the European countries continues its advance. It has long been impossible to reverse the processes of decomposition in Western societies. Even a future victory of Le Pen, or Trump, will not prevent countries from breaking apart in a short period of time. The fruits of this dark age began to mature in the 60&#039;s and now begin to show their true strength.<br><br>It will be a continuation government of Hollande&#039;s policies. Centrist, moderate, and dull, he will serve well to his masters. This will trivialize the role of government. His paralysis will reinforce the idea that something smells rotten in France, in the European Union, and in international politics in general.<br><br>Macron will be forced by circumstances to turn to the economic right, which will further alienate him from the pure left-wing electorate.<br><br>This cycle can be repeated indefinitely, but only as long as the state can be fed back. France will inevitably continue its path of economic stagnation and social degradation.<br><br>While the rest of the media and other powers conspire to keep Le Pen out of the Elysee. This strange international coalition of political-economic interests is going to show its true face to the public. From now on the French politicians will exist only to prevent the FN from winning.","filename":"C8BBxARXgAMU8Ho.jpg-large","ext":".jpg","w":2048,"h":1381,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":168,"tim":1492974573360,"time":1492974573,"md5":"eqy\/oUrUy7eUde+tFjLEoA==","fsize":327851,"resto":0,"id":"7YDwH8XH","country":"ES","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"macron-will-win-while-the-country-slowly","country_name":"Spain","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":122469401,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)15:15:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"Balkanization?","time":1492974907,"resto":122468471,"id":"K79mXXCy","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"}]}

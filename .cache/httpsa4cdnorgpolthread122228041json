The Roman Contubernium would be most effective as a model for what we&#039;re talking about, which is close range, frenzied melees in broken terrain. Small unit sizes allow for greater mobility. Eight was the number the Romans settled on by trial and error. I would submit to you that it&#039;s close to the ideal size.

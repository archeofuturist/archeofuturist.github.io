Berkeley area bros, you need to develop some sort of uniform so that you can recognize each other in the heat of battle. Also, work on some basic advance and withdraw commands. Whistles work well, as they cut through a lot of noise. Remember, what gets people hurt\/killed is isolation from your people. Work as a squad sized unit (8-10 people), and have some sort of standard bearer for every 3-5 squads. Tactics win battles, goys. It&#039;s better that we adapt them first, so we can get the edge over Antifa.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;t.

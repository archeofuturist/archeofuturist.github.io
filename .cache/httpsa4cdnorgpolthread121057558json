This is because if marriage were to fail, the outcome will almost always favor the woman overwhelmingly. Privatizing marriage would remove the tax deductions, which shouldn&#039;t be there in the first place. The couples would make their own contracts, and men would no longer have to worry about being treated unfairly.<br><br>Many disasters could have been prevented if marriage was privatized, the JUSTing Brendan Fraser being one of them. Marriage is a ceremony between two individuals, and should remain as such.","filename":"47325WideModern_Wedding_130916","ext":".jpg","w":620,"h":413,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":166,"tim":1492174999151,"time":1492174999,"md5":"33q6eC5lq+qjA5cdhP1UrQ==","fsize":86975,"resto":0,"id":"HgBGOjFd","country":"SE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"should-marriage-be-privatized","country_name":"Sweden","replies":14,"images":0,"unique_ips":6},{"no":121057915,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)09:07:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121057558\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121057558<\/a><br>It&#039;s a religious ceremony between a man and woman, that&#039;s it.

How did the polls get it so wrong? Was it just people lying so much? Or did they just get the polls wrong? I am just shocked how much they guessed wrong. Has any other election got the polls so off? I don&#039;t remember this before so maybe before the past 20 something years? I am just so shocked right now.","filename":"1487822482659","ext":".png","w":1200,"h":940,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":195,"tim":1491342511761,"time":1491342511,"md5":"YVtIFSyk\/+qVNnq6iXIQKA==","fsize":320193,"resto":0,"id":"r1XLtW\/X","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"was-watching-this-random-livestream-and-they","country_name":"United States","replies":5,"images":1,"unique_ips":4},{"no":119521972,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)17:52:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119521513\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119521513<\/a><br>bump","filename":"1489486179982","ext":".gif","w":306,"h":469,"tn_w":81,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491342729708,"time":1491342729,"md5":"7fUSzRpgtIHMqkpVehBbmQ==","fsize":48011,"resto":119521513,"id":"r1XLtW\/X","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119522224,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)17:54:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119521513\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119521513<\/a><br>? it is simple. they cherry picked results and openly shamed anyone who made their politics public( if it didn&#039;t fall in line). so people lied to polls as well","time":1491342846,"resto":119521513,"id":"azzV+FGd","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119522315,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)17:54:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119521513\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119521513<\/a><br>DO<br><br>NOT<br><br>REPLAY<br><br>AND<br><br>ALWAYS<br><br>SAGE<br><br>SHILL POSTS","time":1491342891,"resto":119521513,"id":"M03Udjy4","country":"BG","country_name":"Bulgaria"},{"no":119522542,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)17:56:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119522315\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119522315<\/a><br>How is this a shill post?

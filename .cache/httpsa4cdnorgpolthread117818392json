We cannot just pour concrete over it because it will leak into ocean anyway. Radiation inside the buildings is too high even for robots and humans would collapse in seconds. <br><br>Marine life is dying in pacific, you can google &quot;pacific die-offs&quot;. MSM is covering it up to avoid global panic. Tokyo isn&#039;t safe for 2020 olympics either. I would not be suprised if they were cancelled because by 2020 Japan is really fucked. People have radiation sickness symptoms and birth defects have gone trough roof. <br><br>Just remember my words if you don&#039;t believe me now. Fukushima will lead to major panic in the future when MSM cannot cover it up anymore. It&#039;s much worse than Chernobyl, reactor 3 had MOX-fuel made from plutonium, thats why it exploded critically, it wasn&#039;t hydrogen explosion. It has been estimated that by now Fukushima has released over hundred times more radioactive fallout into ocean than Chernobyl did into atmosphere.<br><br>America isn&#039;t safe either.

Japanese people are dying like flies but none of these deaths are counted as radiation deaths. They will be counted as &quot;cancer&quot;, &quot;heart attack&quot; or some other bullshit. <br><br>Nuclear industry has always been full of lies and they have downplayed every accident. <br><br>Tepco even admits it&#039;s cover-up:<br><br>https:\/\/www.rt.com\/news\/347637-fuku<wbr>shima-meltdown-cover-up-tepco\/<br><br>But they are still not telling the truth that whole situation is simply uncontrollable.

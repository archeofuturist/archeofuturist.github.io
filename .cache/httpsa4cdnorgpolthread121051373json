It is a weapon of narrative warfare. Very devious. You can claim that anyone in the WWE or WWF pro wrestling ring is also philosopher.

Those low brows somehow have overcome the fear of public speaking as if they are CEO&#039;s of multinational corporations or heads of unions taking care of &quot;business&quot;.","time":1492171610,"resto":121051373,"id":"gBIG23F0","country":"LT","country_name":"Lithuania"},{"no":121052853,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)08:08:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"Isn&#039;t that the essence of jewish eschatology.

In short, the way I see it, he is best described trough comparison to Queen Victoria. He managed to get a bunch of rich powerful and militant russians to come to a consensus, which alone is a grand achievement. Than his pulled our country out from under IMF yoke and restored our status as a Great Power. <br><br>On the flip side his lack of systematisation, I.E. lack of clear succession mechanism and byzantyne nature typical to any government residing in Kremlin, might bury the country in a civil war or under a moron when he leaves politics. His economics are another problem - they aren&#039;t forcing enough domestic industry to form and we only got diversification going after sanctions and low oil prices hit us. But there is a number of arguments that might negate the second issue, such as the fact that there is no clear way to judge what degree of control he has over the system, that is how much of a tyrant he really is. Another possible explanations for lack of quick industrialisation are need to modernise tech industries to match modern standards. &quot;Moscow wasn&#039;t build in a day&quot;","time":1493422160,"resto":123260836,"id":"hKS8JLwC","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"}]}

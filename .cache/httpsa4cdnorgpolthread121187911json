But they had just left her with a bloody nose in cosmopolitan Berlin by giving the anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany (AfD) party 14.5 per cent of the vote, the highest share of the vote for the far-Right since the Second World War. She had to face facts: the electorate did not approve of how quick she was to embrace the influx of refugees on Europe&#039;s doorstep.","filename":"Screen Shot 2017-04-15 at 10.04.49 AM","ext":".png","w":634,"h":414,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":163,"tim":1492244195299,"time":1492244195,"md5":"0LUohie6swUaEWlCnApNvQ==","fsize":45296,"resto":0,"id":"csBrzDUu","country":"DE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"merkel-will-govern-germany-forever-and-ever","country_name":"Germany","replies":21,"images":4,"unique_ips":17},{"no":121188628,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)04:29:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"we really need fucking term limits goddamit","time":1492244946,"resto":121187911,"id":"GhP17BTZ","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":121191258,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)05:10:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"Haters gonna hate.

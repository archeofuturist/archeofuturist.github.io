E.g. the western culture is much more civilized and nob-violent than the sub-saharan African one. However, you can&#039;t explicitly state that &quot;western civilization is best&quot;, because e.g. if you took niggers and had them live in a western society they would wreck shit up, while they stay in check in their own backwards societies where they burn thieves alive.<br>Its pretty much just like comparing people (since multiple people living in the same place for generations = culture). Whites are smarter - niggers are faster. Are whites better? Well, you&#039;d have to say that brains are better than speed to say that,","time":1490911178,"resto":118973888,"id":"J10RoVaK","country":"GR","country_name":"Greece"}]}

The buzz i used to get from drinking wore off ages ago. I had a mid life crisis when i was 25 (mid life the way im going) and attributed my sadness to being on the internet and here all the time.<br><br>Decided to do somthing about it and started going to the gym, got in shape, made some friends with some of the guys in the gym and started going out with one of their sisters.Im 28 now and im realizing that i aren&#039;t the slightest bit happier then i was spending my weekends sitting in getting drunk and browsing 4 chan.The main difference is that now i have to smile a lot more or people will ask me whats wrong.","time":1492469391,"resto":121588605,"id":"Gcl6j1Mv","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"},{"no":121596248,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)18:50:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"Sometimes, things have been going pretty well for me these past few months and ive had some really good weeka but sometimes I just fall into a weird depressive funk where I have no energy and have this dull achy pain in my chest and stomach, it&#039;s not so much a physical sensation as a spiritual and emotional one, I just feel sort of empty.

System cost is more than the missile or bomb and the better your systems the more effective your ordnance delivery. <br><br>You love Russia by the tone of your post and that&#039;s your duty as a Swede, but jet fuel is jet fuel and unguided bombs are still unguided bombs. Logistic rules are the same reality for anyone. Fuel doesn&#039;t move itself. <br><br>Even if your logistics labor is free, distance imposes itself on transportation. Russia can either fly from Russian bases (which it must still supply from elsewhere in the country) or much more (locally) convenient Syrian bases which are nearer the battle but further from logistics support. If your forward operating base is near the battle that greatly improve response times but operating costs skyrocket.<br><br>Take my word for absolutely nothing. Then look into it yourself. <br><br>Start with a map and some air base locations. It&#039;s fun and interesting. I spent my USAF career fixing fighters and generating sorties and am interested in all aircraft combat employment. It&#039;s a fascinating technical, logistics and military ballet.<br><br>You can estimate fuel loads per fighter. Each fighter sortie (any fighter, any air force) uses most of one fuel load and a lot more if you have to hit a tanker. (Tanker costs are additional.) A Flanker takes about 20,000lbs of internal fuel plus external load if wing and\/or centerline stores are used. Max. weapons load is about 9000lbs. Nobody likes to come back with bombs on the wing (it beats the shit out of landing gear and tires) and an effective attack sortie will empty the pylons. <br><br>Ground crew, maintainers, traffic controllers, security and everyone else must be supported at bare base\/Syrian base locations even if the locals feed them. They require substantial equipment and parts support to operate, maintain, repair and inspect aircraft.

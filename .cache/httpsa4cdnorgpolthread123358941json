But when you look at the numbers you can see clearly that this is a myth or at least they&#039;ve been sold a pup.<br><br>Quite simply, the union has been an economic disaster for all the people of Northern Ireland. Everyone has been impoverished by the union and this shows no sign of letting up.<br><br>The contrast between the economic performances of the North and south is shocking. If we go back to 1920, 80pc of the industrial output of the entire island of Ireland came from the three counties centred on Belfast. This was where all Irish industry was. It was industrial and innovative; northern entrepreneurs and inventors were at the forefront of industrial innovation. By 1911, Belfast was the biggest city in Ireland, with a population of close to 400,000, which was growing rapidly. It was by far the richest part of the island.<br><br>In contrast, the rest of the Irish economy was agricultural and backward and the only industrial base we had could be termed a &#039;beer and biscuits&#039; economy, dominated by the likes of Guinness and Jacobs.<br><br>Fast-forward to now and the collapse of the once-dynamic Northern economy versus that of the Republic is shocking. Having been a fraction of the North&#039;s at independence, the Republic&#039;s industrial output is now 10 times greater than that of Northern Ireland.<br><br>The Republic&#039;s economy is now four times that of the North, even though the labour force is not even two-and-a-half times bigger.<br><br>In terms of income per head, the Republic is now almost twice as rich per person as the North. The average income per head in the Republic is \u20ac39,873, while it languishes at \u20ac23,700 up North.","filename":"1466948687309","ext":".jpg","w":800,"h":820,"tn_w":121,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493491611350,"time":1493491611,"md5":"IlTP+mOcig4qcYlaUCw+VQ==","fsize":437056,"resto":123358941,"id":"L0V7MJvx","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"},{"no":123364728,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)14:47:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"Reminder","filename":"ge2017","ext":".jpg","w":1230,"h":1020,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":103,"tim":1493491629498,"time":1493491629,"md5":"55ovXc+yhbVrUZH0L4Yksw==","fsize":290763,"resto":123358941,"id":"iGVvH\/5H","country":"GB","m_img":1,"country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123364753,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)14:47:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123364618\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123364618<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;full of anxiety<\/span><br>High suicide rates in Russia, no?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What is the solution for the Irish problem?<\/span><br>Headpats.","time":1493491643,"resto":123358941,"id":"uU3yIzjW","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"},{"no":123364754,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)14:47:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123364412\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123364412<\/a><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=59w<wbr>DP2ar1WA","time":1493491643,"resto":123358941,"id":"Dtwttfin","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123364757,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)14:47:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123364378\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123364378<\/a><br>Just be an hero an stream it tory faggot","time":1493491644,"resto":123358941,"id":"w3mpKGW7","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123364759,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)14:47:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123364164\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123364164<\/a><br>Are labour claiming the public is weak?<br>Also shouldn&#039;t it also be weak for the weak?

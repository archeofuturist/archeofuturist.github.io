It&#039;s obvious that the ultimate root of all of this is a juvenile desire of a person to get what they want. It&#039;s childishness to demand that everyone everywhere think like you do. Demanding that the people you want get elected and carry out the policies you demand. Any person who falls out of line is a symbol of the fact that not everyone thinks like you, not everyone wants the same people elected, not everyone wants the policies you demand. People in Hollywood are some of the very worst because they are so used to getting what they demand, and anyone who represents the fact that the desires of the nation they live in might be different from their own desires is infuriating to someone who is very used to getting what they want.","filename":"hollywood-liberals-make-fortunesglorifying-violence-andmaking-violence-lookacceptable-and-then-12222410","ext":".png","w":500,"h":362,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":181,"tim":1490101478224,"time":1490101478,"md5":"BRo0J1AfiHUEfL6ec6G1uw==","fsize":79326,"resto":0,"id":"diULwvXk","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"hollywood-mccarthyism-being-called-out","country_name":"United States","replies":5,"images":2,"unique_ips":6},{"no":117623395,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)09:19:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117622455\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117622455<\/a><br>what&#039;s gloriously stupid is that they don&#039;t realize that they have found themselves to the left of russia, and they are the new &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;soviets&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;","filename":"Putin Pepe","ext":".jpg","w":406,"h":422,"tn_w":120,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490102350596,"time":1490102350,"md5":"RJ9skZdQDBLQkt7joLtZNw==","fsize":12353,"resto":117622455,"id":"DN54WZrI","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":117623587,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)09:22:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117623395\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117623395<\/a><br>Pretty damn easy to be the left of Russia when Russia is run by an ultranationalist right wing autocrat oligarch","time":1490102543,"resto":117622455,"id":"xb+\/K1n8","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117623655,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)09:23:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"The music industry calls Trump supporters Nazis then wears SS uniforms to Hillary rallys.","filename":"IMG_1166","ext":".jpg","w":463,"h":450,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":121,"tim":1490102597501,"time":1490102597,"md5":"o337OcicDN4EoYaUkcgtRw==","fsize":43129,"resto":117622455,"id":"\/kz66Bdk","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117623669,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)09:23:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117623587\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117623587<\/a><br>Whoa guys, we reached peak buzzwords","time":1490102607,"resto":117622455,"id":"tXgItQy6","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":117623721,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)09:24:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"Every second movie is about a guy loosing his wife\/kid\/dog and going on rampage to revenge them meanwhile killing 200 people the most possible gruesome way....<br><br>Then the next day they are on the streets protesting against violence\/cop brutality\/death penalty\/butchering animals for food....","time":1490102654,"resto":117622455,"id":"7EBSkBFk","country":"HU","country_name":"Hungary"}]}

After a box has been chosen, but before a box is opened to let you observe a coin, the probability is <br>2<br>\/<br>3<br> that the box has two of the same kind of coin. If the probability of &quot;observing a gold coin&quot; in combination with &quot;the box has two of the same kind of coin&quot; is 1\/2, then the probability of &quot;observing a silver coin&quot; in combination with &quot;the box has two of the same kind of coin&quot; must also be 1\/2. And if the probability that the box has two like coins changes to 1\/2 no matter what kind of coin is shown, the probability would have to be 1\/2 even if you hadn&#039;t observed a coin this way. Since we know his probability is 2\/3, not 1\/2, we have an apparent paradox.

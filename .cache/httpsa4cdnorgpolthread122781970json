Border crossings are already down 61% up to recent dates and in the year 2017 there is expected to be 2 million deportation conducted by the US government, as opposed to 450,000 deportations in 2016 under Obama (which included many border turnarounds rather than arrests of resident illegal aliens already in the US).<br><br>These numbers combined with self-deportations mean that the illegal alien community is decreasing. In addition, Trump is conducting an H1B visa crackdown to raise wages and employment in the tech industry and a refugee crackdown to remove overstayed refugee communities like Somalians and Haitians in the US.<br><br>There is expected to be an announcement on the matter this week, on top of the tax bill announcement on Wednesday. Dems are threatening a shutdown if wall funding is included in a bill this week. Trump may well seek to get the budget appropriation for the wall in the early fall instead if opposition seems to fierce from a combined Dem and fiscal conservative front. If this occurs we will be shilled with the wall is never happening statements but this is really a sophomoric attempt to demoralize coming into special elections and 2018 primaries to make the DNC seems stronger. <br><br>The political cost of not allowing the wall to be funded during the entire Trump administration is too high for the RNC. The wall will be funded. When? Hopefully this summer, possibly this fall.

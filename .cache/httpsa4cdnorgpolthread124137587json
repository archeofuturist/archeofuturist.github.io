For example, the legislation would give the state government the power to provide at least 5,000 low-wage workers each year to company executives who cooperate with state political leaders. It would also give the state politicians the power to ruin executives by suddenly withdrawing the imported workers from companies who disagree with the preferences of state politicians.<\/span>","time":1493944413,"resto":124137587,"id":"EsWJ7\/hy","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124138297,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)20:38:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124137587\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124137587<\/a><br>Welp this is gonna be slid.","time":1493944691,"resto":124137587,"id":"EsWJ7\/hy","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

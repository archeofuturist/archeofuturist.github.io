Only thing we can hope to happen is what is currently in motion. All these popular youtubers and e-celebrities (many who don&#039;t even engage in political commentary) are reaching out to their viewers and letting them in on the situation. They&#039;re rallying the viewers of youtubers on their side. A nice side benefit of this is that these youtubers are all mostly turning their viewers against the sjw left-wing political correctness. It&#039;s not enough to be in charge of the political positions in a nation but you also have to have control of the culture. Many of these youtubers are left wing but are bringing leftism back towards the center and even bringing some to the right. Paul Joseph Watson is pretty on the money when he says that being right wing is the new counter culture. We might witness what occurred back when it was the far right Christians in charge of culture cried that videogames with pokemon was satanic. They will lose power over culture and become politically irrelevant.","time":1491170869,"resto":119251151,"id":"sWv1saNU","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119253252,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)18:13:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119252681\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119252681<\/a><br>Todo?

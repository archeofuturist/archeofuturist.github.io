I used the value of a human life given in 2011 by the EPA, and adjusted to 2016 dollars. The number I got was 6.1 trillion. Calculated differently (using a &quot;per-year of additional life&quot; standard[2]) one gets a value of 2.76 trillion. Some articles on the subject of reparations claim that blacks deserve as much as 1.4 trillion.(While that same article posits that including a modest annual interest the number becomes 6.4 trillion, it seems clear to me the the principal was paid with great excess long ago.) The value of the lives lost in the American Civil War at least doubles any reparations that might be proposed in the modern age.<br><br>Pardon my blogging but after all the math I need to say this: As unpleasant as it is to contemplate, I have done the math. I have counted the values of the fallen, and weighed it against the most generous estimate the the living have demanded and I FIND EVERY ONE OF THESE LAZY, GREEDY BASTARDS WANTING. FUCK THEM.

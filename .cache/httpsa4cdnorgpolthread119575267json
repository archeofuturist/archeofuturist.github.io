The molten rock at the core, spinning at 1000 mph as the earth cooled, left a hollow area in the center that was spoken of by ancient cultures and rediscovered by the Germans at the turn of the 20th century. We are told the Earth is a sphere but even Neil Tyson will tell you it&#039;s fatter below the equator than above it. Admiral Richard Byrd, medal of honor recipient, explored Antarctica as well as entering the Agartha entrance at the North Pole. The Van Allen Belts were put there by the Agathans due to concerns of nuclear warfare. As we&#039;ve seen with nuclear tests such as Starfish Prime, these belts keep the radiation collected within and cover the Earth except for the poles where the entrances are.

There are images of the entrance at the North but it&#039;s explained away as the magnetic effects on the weather that only makes it look like a vortex. The Irish Celts believed in God people that arrived on flying ships from the North called the Tuatha De Danann and the Germanic tribes including the Vikings had stories of realms along Yggdrasil where gods and giants lived. The Celts also had a similar tree they called The tree of life. There&#039;s an international treaty keeping people out of Antarctica after German bases were discovered there.","time":1491373460,"resto":119575267,"id":"9X42qOO6","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119576907,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)02:26:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119576553\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119576553<\/a><br>The earth is both flat and hollow.

What good are you to society if you encourage its downfall? <br><br>Christian values would preserve your family. Instead, you sat idly by they opened our borders because &quot;nobody is illegal&quot;. Your parents and their parents had a culture which has disappeared as society was forced to cater to the lowest common denominator. Because we serve &quot;humankind&quot; you encourage removing the religion and the culture of those who came before you, just so we make sure Pajeet and ChingChong and Muhammad don&#039;t get hurt feelings. <br><br>Maybe it doesn&#039;t matter. Your bloodline likely ends with you, anyhow. You&#039;re not having children, and why should you? Is it better to serve man than to serve God? Your selfishness and hedonism seem to be more important than creating people to inherit the planet. Yes, that same planet which you claim to love so much. The planet that your ancestors made their own. You roll over and die so that third worlders can have more space for their children.<br><br>Those third worlders are bringing the values of the countries that came before them. They expect crime to be a natural part of life. They expect politicians to be corrupt. They want all the free handouts you&#039;ll give them. These aren&#039;t the neighbors that Christ said we must love, but you insist on reducing Christianity to the Golden Rule, and look where that has led us.<br><br>You tend to support degeneracy in society. You support lewdness in public, you support drug use, you support criminals, and you do not support society because you&#039;re designing a flawed moral system. You are nowhere near as smart as you think you are. You are not redpilled because you&#039;re making the stupid mistake of rejecting Christianity.","filename":"tumblr_m2n8087uBD1r5fi6d","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":505,"tn_w":247,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492306481645,"time":1492306481,"md5":"6KEkh+57ReaoR\/lnkRDkfQ==","fsize":84534,"resto":0,"id":"oIahqtfJ","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"can-redpilled-atheists-exist","country_name":"United States","replies":10,"images":4,"unique_ips":7},{"no":121295916,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)21:36:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121295745\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121295745<\/a><br>We have this thread every hour you god damned heretic","time":1492306572,"resto":121295745,"id":"YOS3L1yH","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121296302,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)21:39:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121295916\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121295916<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;We have this thread every hour you god damned heretic<\/span><br><br>Pretty sure this is the first time I&#039;ve typed this wording though","time":1492306750,"resto":121295745,"id":"oIahqtfJ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121296538,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)21:41:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121295745\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121295745<\/a><br> Enough shilling.

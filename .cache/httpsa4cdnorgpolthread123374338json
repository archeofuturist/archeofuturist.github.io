I&#039;ve been lurking for over a decade and most people using these boards seem aware of the ridiculousness that goes on in them, but I&#039;m not sure about \/pol\/. It seems like a lot people here honestly believe that people on 4chan, most of which are uneducated, underemployed, and lonely, know what&#039;s *really* going on. Jokes are fun and all, it&#039;s just sad to think that there&#039;s people out there that actually believe what comes about from board culture.","filename":"1451844584302","ext":".jpg","w":654,"h":639,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":244,"tim":1493496320188,"time":1493496320,"md5":"VzP4yllEVXV8r00bWW4Rmw==","fsize":35238,"resto":0,"id":"oZWlgx0i","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"do-your-views-align-with-that-of-mainstream-pol","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":2,"unique_ips":3},{"no":123374605,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)16:07:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"Get a load of this fucking Californian student","filename":"1486246585232","ext":".jpg","w":679,"h":497,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":91,"tim":1493496442997,"time":1493496442,"md5":"TDlrhNTJNzQpUdBhd3hqWA==","fsize":77612,"resto":123374338,"id":"KMXsPBiQ","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123374884,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)16:09:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"x\u00f4 x\u00f4","filename":"gap","ext":".jpg","w":379,"h":395,"tn_w":119,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493496583912,"time":1493496583,"md5":"M7QpHL2eAo83l2U6rH4Rqg==","fsize":23708,"resto":123374338,"id":"7XId14l\/","country":"PT","country_name":"Portugal"}]}

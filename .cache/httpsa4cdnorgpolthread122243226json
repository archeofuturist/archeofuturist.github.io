I consider myself an agnostic deist\/theist, simply because I have no way to be absolutely sure about the existence of God, but I can see how one could reasonably argue from certain axiomatic statements in order to conclude that there is a God (and I think living as a theist is more likely to be a good life than living as an atheist), but that same sort of methodological skepticism leaves me without certainty about the person of Jesus, even though I grant that under less rigorous criteria, it seems reasonable to conclude that Jesus was crucified and resurrected. The holohoax has actually done more to undermine my confidence in Jesus than anything, because Christians will endlessly point out that it was ONLY 40 years (or whatever) from when Jesus was resurrected to when the first gospel was written down, but we can see how quickly stories can mutate over time, and who is to say that some of those mutations were not swept along, and therefore we cannot be certain about what Jesus said or did? <br><br>I&#039;m just a bitter skeptic who is hanging on to his doubts so I don&#039;t have to subject myself to the endless agonizing over what to believe. It is so much quieter and simpler to just meditate on natural law and pray by myself. I don&#039;t want to try to figure out which denomination had it correct, or whether the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father AND the son or only from the Father.

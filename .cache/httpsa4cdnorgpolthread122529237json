He mentioned funding a run for state legislature. My district is currently represented by a literal faggot socialist in our very conservative state. He thinks I should register as an independent and make a 2018 run, just to get my name out there. I&#039;m pretty clean cut, and if I may be so vain, look damn good in a suit. The old man has never made a bad business decision, and is very calculating when it comes down to it. \/pol\/, can we start taking over state politics?","filename":"2009_Leg_Party_Control_map","ext":".gif","w":700,"h":383,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":136,"tim":1493001040450,"time":1493001040,"md5":"hzJiefKGcfj+jjW5N8GVwQ==","fsize":42684,"resto":0,"id":"51gDoSDc","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"taking-over-state-office-from-liberals","country_name":"United States","replies":4,"images":0,"unique_ips":4},{"no":122529495,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)22:33:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122529237\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122529237<\/a><br>Hell fucking yeah.

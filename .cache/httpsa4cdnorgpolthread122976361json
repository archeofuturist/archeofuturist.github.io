Turkey would basically use access to the Mediterennean as a way to pressure Russia, because, as I said before, they will lose the unfettered access they currently enjoy","time":1493262722,"resto":122976361,"id":"l0IkjOUL","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122986219,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)23:12:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122977944\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122977944<\/a><br>Kek n save","time":1493262730,"resto":122976361,"id":"dhZ3wRIm","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122986224,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)23:12:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122986115\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122986115<\/a><br>Sure, just like in Iraq.<br>Also<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Israel<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;willing to actually get involved<\/span><br>lmao","time":1493262730,"resto":122976361,"id":"eJgbv7dU","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":122986324,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)23:12:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122985668\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122985668<\/a><br>how about you pack out and leave, google fuck face","time":1493262774,"resto":122976361,"id":"6RIVEG4M","country":"BE","country_name":"Belgium"},{"no":122986348,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)23:13:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122986181\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122986181<\/a><br>Israeli<br>State<br>In<br>Levant","filename":"BzXjg8lCQAATa2W","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":450,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1493262784334,"time":1493262784,"md5":"YL3fHbCSu9ZxP4UdnWM\/fg==","fsize":42572,"resto":122976361,"id":"MAtVOr3i","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":122986367,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)23:13:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122986115\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122986115<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;have already indicated their willingness<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;have done absolutely fucking nothing after the gas attacks in formatting one<\/span><br><br>Your&#039;e going to invade another ME country by yourself again.

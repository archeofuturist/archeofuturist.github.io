It&#039;s about an innawoods White Family led by a strong Father role model who&#039;s against modern degeneracy and teaches morals, self-education, survivalism, and intense physical exercize. Plot and comedy ensues when they discover that their grandfather is going to bury their dead mother against her wishes to be lit on a pagan funeral pyre, so the family has to travel into the &quot;real (degenerate) world&quot; to grandfather&#039;s place, using their training and cohesion as a team to steal mother&#039;s body.

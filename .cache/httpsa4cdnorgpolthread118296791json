Now, me just graduating highschool, and after being redpilled here on 4chan and by stephan molyneux on religion, believe it to all be a big hoax. <br><br>After my parents heard my thoughts on this, they say either I confess my sins for betraying god or I am to leave and go to hell. This came as a shock to me, since they&#039;d always been there for me until now...<br><br>What should I do, anons?

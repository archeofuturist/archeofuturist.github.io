They have been the basis of it and they have been, ultimately, the sole purpose of everything. The plants, here, blooming around us in immensity and glory, everywhere! In the deserts, the arctic, with sand sheer upon the ground, with great flows of blue ice. They&#039;re everywhere, circling and going under the ground like veins, veins of pure beauty and being. Look around you here, we&#039;re surrounded by them and inundated by these beautiful green forms of life. To the left and to the right and to the north and to the south, to the east and to the west. But there are also insects. Have you ever read Maurice Maeterlinck&#039;s Life of the Bee? It&#039;s a glorious book. A book about the nature of the hive; the great architecture of these beings beyond death that represent an exoskeleton of life that contains no life in human form because they are reduced essentially to the matter of function. Insects. They are function. They have no false concept of individuality, they serve the whole, which is them - spiritually. Each insect is a part of a greater whole, they have one soul, headed in this case by the queen, superintended upon by slaves who nurture her in the nectar of their own milk - the egalitarian mass of people. The more I looked at these insects, the more I saw them, the more I looked at them through a magnifying glass, I wanted...I wanted to destroy them! I had a decision to make. And even as I looked at them through the magnifying glass I had the belief that I could refract the sun down, through the glass, unto them so as to destroy what was there. And it was when I looked at evolution that I came to the decision upon which my entire life has been based hitherto; that&#039;s too destructive, keep the insects to harvest the plants.<\/span>","filename":"bowdn","ext":".jpg","w":601,"h":459,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":95,"tim":1490106892534,"time":1490106892,"md5":"d3b9IrYpgkXBv6PWYhDg+g==","fsize":55116,"resto":117621028,"id":"jRTXj\/\/r","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":117629357,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)10:35:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117628991\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117628991<\/a>","filename":"1485473345403","ext":".jpg","w":93,"h":125,"tn_w":93,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490106912340,"time":1490106912,"md5":"+VMdcC7QIsc11I49kEjEQg==","fsize":2097,"resto":117621028,"id":"PK0GKB2b","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":117629384,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)10:35:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117629328\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117629328<\/a><br>I know lad.","filename":"karen6","ext":".png","w":388,"h":421,"tn_w":115,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490106931989,"time":1490106931,"md5":"v9MVtGmQrZA5zMiNeS3+pg==","fsize":270709,"resto":117621028,"id":"59zg1qfQ","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":117629422,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)10:35:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117629331\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117629331<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Evolution begins in the seas, it begins with the severing of cells, each one from another. The amoebae split, they bifurcated one as against another forming new cellular forms of life. Then they became fishes, they flowed in the oceans and soon amphibians flopped upon the land and moved about. Reptiles emerged out of these creatures, then larger ones, then larger ones again. They came forwards great claws and teeth, hungering for new prey, all over the plant surrounded by islets and volcanoes. These creatures finally gave way, a meteor hit the Earth and all that was left were mammals. They began small and furry, scurrying in the undergrowth, again in the plants! Without them nothing at all. These creatures moved onwards and upwards until semi-humanoids began to take shape. Finally we emerged. After several thousand years of development what have we done with what we&#039;ve got?! A bit of culture, a few Gods, a few cathedrals, a bit of knowledge. Work followed by television, that&#039;s what 21st century life is for most people. All we have around us are insects. 40% of people in a Western society don&#039;t own a book. I sense a distaste for them all. Everywhere, philistinism, ignorance, absence of science, no one thinking of progress, no one thinking about how we could go on, biologically, from where we are now to where we have to get in order to become divine. I began to see a rancidness there, pure function without any prospect of evolutionary growth because it was circular whereas the plants go onwards because they evolve up towards the sun.<\/span>","filename":"1480544550223","ext":".png","w":368,"h":414,"tn_w":111,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490106956277,"time":1490106956,"md5":"EWV3PujWhZeVVouaXhKW9Q==","fsize":321533,"resto":117621028,"id":"jRTXj\/\/r","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":117629442,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)10:36:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117629182\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117629182<\/a>","filename":"4917d6b71097a012155c4a8194912ab19f94f9f21f3abc8e87ed4030bfde2b19","ext":".png","w":606,"h":1190,"tn_w":63,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490106964315,"time":1490106964,"md5":"FrT97IpkLr6wY54o9S9PKA==","fsize":99378,"resto":117621028,"id":"j7S6mmNH","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":117629480,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)10:36:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117628947\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117628947<\/a><br>I was watching earlier but got bored as fuck and started watching old robot wars instead.","time":1490106987,"resto":117621028,"id":"htokdxta","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":117629516,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)10:36:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"https:\/\/www.findapprenticeship.serv<wbr>ice.gov.uk\/apprenticeship\/-81717<br><br>Why don&#039;t you apply for this sandwich artist apprenticeship at subway<br><br>You could make \u00a3131 a week (37.5 hours) to make sandwiches for a giant multinational company.","time":1490107010,"resto":117621028,"id":"IW8hsxHQ","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":117629649,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)10:38:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117629442\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117629442<\/a><br>Is Gerry Adams having a stroke?

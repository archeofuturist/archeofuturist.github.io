While they weren&#039;t the primary mode of exposure, they did act as the influencer of what information was exposed to the masses through various mediums. <br><br>When you consider just how slim the margins were in certain states, as well as the lack of enthusiasm amongst the youth for Clinton, it&#039;s not farfetched to think that a handful of autists in their 20s and early 30s in certain states easily could have made a difference through their votes and encouraging family members to vote alone. <br><br>Having said that, anybody on here who wants to outright &quot;take credit&quot; for the Trump win is a clown. Elections are group efforts, and while everybody and everything that led up to it played a part, politics are a massive machine that not even the enormous media has total control over. <br><br>Once again, though. They absolutely influenced the election, there&#039;s no question. They also served as a great distraction as the Clinton campaign tried to take aim at nonexistent entities that they didn&#039;t totally understand, taking her focus away from the actual issues at hand.","time":1492734464,"resto":122067974,"id":"hTXHDWLP","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122069515,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)20:28:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122067974\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122067974<\/a><br>\/pol\/ has always hated BLUMPF and loved based muslim assad. \/pol\/ is NOT satire! go backtoreddit.jpg<br><br>t. based oldfag since 2002","filename":"drumpf","ext":".jpg","w":595,"h":362,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":76,"tim":1492734495444,"time":1492734495,"md5":"K9BHslicRynzjB5nTEYNXg==","fsize":58096,"resto":122067974,"id":"7Stv7fFL","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122069516,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)20:28:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122067974\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122067974<\/a><br>considering Trump&#039;s narrow victories in the states that were decisive in his favor, we probably were a part of the rising tide that pushed him over the edge<br><br>Hillary Clinton gave a speech about the &quot;alt-right&quot; and cartoon frogs, and the media directly responded to things we were talking about so it&#039;s stupid to say we did nothing at all.<br><br>But there&#039;s also no way we caused tens of millions of people to vote for Trump.

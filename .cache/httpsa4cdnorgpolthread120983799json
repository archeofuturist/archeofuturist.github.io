That conclusion is that we really fucking need Christianity. I&#039;m actually an atheist, but I&#039;ve thought quite a while on this, and this is the conclusion I&#039;ve come to. Everything is shitty in the way it is right now thanks to religion going out of style. As much as the bible is filled with authoritarian bullshit...some of that bullshit is highly potent truth about maintaining society. It is entirely possible to live without a bible to guide you and still have strong morals and understanding of values in society, however it is not a given. I think many attempting to think freely reach this state...they think a little bit about religion, and realize 1) theres some bullshit, and 2) some of it is restrictive. The automatic reaction is to fully reject religion. Unfortunately it seems most stop there, they don&#039;t continue to contemplate about the idea of God, or the point of humanities existence etc etc. <br>This, combined with innate instinctual desire to see humanity succeed, creates your typical liberal atheist: A person who doesn&#039;t give the slightest fuck about religion, and likely a loose understanding of morals.<br><br>Given all I&#039;ve learned about religion and Christianity...I&#039;ve concluded we desperately need religion, and Christianity is the absolute best one, most likely to be the most successful and lead to the best most civilized world. I do think eventually religion will be obsolete. Perhaps in a world with less anti-intellectualism, less propaganda, and better education.<br><br>For the time being tho, yall need Jesus.<br><br>I&#039;m probable going to start going to church lol, shit should be fun.","filename":"1492072696833","ext":".jpg","w":900,"h":904,"tn_w":248,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492127069481,"time":1492127069,"md5":"86TmMeTXZ7wGQVCAsDM+Lw==","fsize":239628,"resto":0,"id":"kQdjYV\/u","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"alright-soall-this-recent-shit-has-led-me-to-a","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":1},{"no":120984525,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)19:49:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120983799\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120983799<\/a><br>typical liberal atheist <br>A person who doesn&#039;t give the slightest fuck about religion, loose understanding of morals but wants to help fellow man. Problem is all the ways of doing that are not actually to help others, but to satisfy the instinctual drive to help. This is why they think open borders are a good idea. If you don&#039;t think about it much and you look at a bunch of refugees then you&#039;ll be like &quot;wow borders are fucking terrible&quot; But if you do think about it then you reach the conclusion of &quot;holy fuck can&#039;t believe anyone would ever want open borders&quot;","time":1492127376,"resto":120983799,"id":"kQdjYV\/u","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

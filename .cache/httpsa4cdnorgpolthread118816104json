The FTC had the authority to bring enforcement actions against companies who engaged in &quot;unfair and deceptive practices.&quot; The 2015 reclassification of broadband providers removed internet service providers (ISPs) from the FTC&#039;s jurisdiction. On April 20, 2016, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) proposed a rule applying privacy requirements of the Communications Act to Internet Service Providers (ISPs). However, the proposed rule would not apply to edge providers and web sites, like Facebook and Twitter, since they still fall under the FTC&#039;s authority.<br>As you know, Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona introduced S.J. Res. 34 on March 7, 2017. This resolution would repeal the FCC&#039;s privacy rules. I do not believe a two-track system in which the FCC regulates ISPs while the FTC monitors the rest of the internet ecosystem is good for consumers. For this reason I cosponsored S.J. Res 34.","time":1490812522,"resto":118816104,"id":"0GvQtZcv","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118816381,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)14:35:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118816104\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118816104<\/a><br>I was in class and I saw one of my classmates was browsing this website, so I went over to his MacBook and checked out the website address, and went on here myself to see what a disgusting website it is with disgusting users.

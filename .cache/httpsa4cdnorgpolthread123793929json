I explained that it would be necessary in the same way Israel needed to be created to protect the jewish people (my friends are all hyper blue-pilled cause I live in the (((GTA))) Both in sense of cultural and genetic heritage, otherwise with no nation they would fade into a sort of obscurity within their host nation and cease to exist.

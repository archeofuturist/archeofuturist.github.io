Atheism is in decline worldwide, with the number of atheists falling from 4.5% of the world&#039;s population in 1970 to 2.0% in 2010 and projected to drop to 1.8% by 2020, <br><br>Real surveys and statistics say atheism is on the decline worldwide. Sorry atheists but atheism is not on the rise nor is it winning. It&#039;s still the minority and a declining one at that. <br><br>The Pew Research Center&#039;s statistics show that atheism is expected to continue to decline all the way into 2050 with a continued growth of religion. Other research also shows a huge surge in growth for Christianity in China which is currently the world&#039;s most &quot;atheist&quot; nation because of the atheist communist government suppressing religion, the research suggests that China will soon become the world&#039;s most Christian nation within 15 years. <br><br>This is simply history repeating itself: Christianity prospered in Rome back in the ancient era when it was suppressed and it still grew in the militant atheist soviet Russia when it was suppressed there only a century ago with the majority of Russians today now also identifying as Christian. Just goes to show that atheist suppression of religion still doesn&#039;t stop religion.<br><br>Sources for the legion of whiny \/Redditor\/ fedoras that will no doubt show up it this thread:<br><br>http:\/\/www.pewforum.org\/2015\/04\/02\/<wbr>religious-projections-2010-2050\/<br>http:\/\/www.pewforum.org\/2012\/12\/18\/<wbr>global-religious-landscape-unaffili<wbr>ated\/<br>http:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/news\/wor<wbr>ldnews\/asia\/china\/10776023\/China-on<wbr>-course-to-become-worlds-most-Chris<wbr>tian-nation-within-15-years.html<br>http:\/\/masterrussian.com\/russia\/fac<wbr>ts.htm","filename":"1490142549767","ext":".jpg","w":608,"h":755,"tn_w":201,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491594149991,"time":1491594149,"md5":"gbLQR\/M\/TdWWLU+dYjIA+Q==","fsize":123410,"resto":0,"id":"9EmemMcv","country":"PL","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"atheism-is-the-fastest-shrinking-religion-in-the","country_name":"Poland","replies":8,"images":2,"unique_ips":9},{"no":120010534,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)15:44:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"Are you that same Catholic that keeps on saying that \/pol\/ is a Catholic board or are all Polish people like this?","time":1491594275,"resto":120010194,"id":"SvI88HU3","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120010773,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)15:46:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"nice shitty edit","time":1491594363,"resto":120010194,"id":"ItnA5dDX","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120010907,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)15:46:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120010194\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120010194<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;atheists<\/span><br>nice shop, christcuck<br>http:\/\/www.dailymail.co.uk\/news\/art<wbr>icle-3552751\/White-evangelical-coup<wbr>le-Aaron-Rachel-Halbert-birth-black<wbr>-triplets-adopting-African-American<wbr>-embryos-left-couple-s-IVF-treatmen<wbr>t.html","time":1491594413,"resto":120010194,"id":"1V8vXb4Z","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120010955,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)15:47:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120010194\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120010194<\/a><br>How do two whites choose to give birth to three black people? <br><br>Is there a pill that can change you babies black that I dont know about?","filename":"1323631239808","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":960,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1491594429092,"time":1491594429,"md5":"VGIle8Tc4IXJPbSf2VAcbw==","fsize":170992,"resto":120010194,"id":"9ma4O7Ch","country":"ZA","m_img":1,"country_name":"South Africa"},{"no":120011554,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)15:50:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120010194\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120010194<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;editing tgat to pdstebd they aren&#039;t christcucks <\/span><br>And even funnier they already two nogs at home but they needed more.<br><a href=\"#p120010955\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120010955<\/a><br>The article says they got them as embryos.","time":1491594657,"resto":120010194,"id":"9QWqrDs1","country":"CH","country_name":"Switzerland"},{"no":120011726,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)15:51:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120010194\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120010194<\/a><br>The black pill is hard to swallow","time":1491594718,"resto":120010194,"id":"qhALiMeR","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120012539,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)15:56:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120010194\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120010194<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Theism is the fastest shrinking religion in the world.<\/span><br><br>See how fucking stupid that sounds?

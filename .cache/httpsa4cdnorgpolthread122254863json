There&#039;s a video of how they are made and its literally a slab of metal cut into the shape of a sword, grinded down and then painted to give the damascus look.<br><br>Chinese iron is very shitty and they have zero control over who makes the iron or where it came from chinks always chink eachother. Japanese sand iron is rare, they are restricted mining it and that&#039;s why they only use expensive quality iron.","time":1492850296,"resto":122254863,"id":"0yyWCQ0a","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":122255338,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)04:38:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122255217\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122255217<\/a><br>weeb","time":1492850317,"resto":122254863,"id":"gR3cBIQh","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":122255378,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)04:39:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122254863\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122254863<\/a><br><br>Jews fear the samurai","time":1492850364,"resto":122254863,"id":"dk8rsvFO","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122255829,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)04:46:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122254863\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122254863<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;shopping for swords.<\/span><br>assburgers confirmed. what is it with assburgers and the fascination with japanese swords? <br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=QJ3<wbr>_w9Nr3e0","time":1492850803,"resto":122254863,"id":"g0VNEpFy","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"}]}

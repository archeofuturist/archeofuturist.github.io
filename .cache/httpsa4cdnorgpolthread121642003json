The only reason they do this is because their country is becoming ghird world. They will not be able to enforce these laws just like they are unable to enforce the laws prohibiting raping and assaulting Germans. Theh allowed in around 1-2 million unknown thirldworlders. Hundreds of thousands are unaccounted for. They ignore deportation decisions and just roam around preying on locals. The police arrests them and lets them go. Cuckmany is a clusterfuck. Its like this idiotic burka ban. It changes nothing.","filename":"1492279310128","ext":".jpg","w":864,"h":1026,"tn_w":105,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492493263781,"time":1492493263,"md5":"SlH993Y9XGD1l\/KWH+5HTQ==","fsize":256459,"resto":121642003,"id":"7aSWlZAw","country":"PL","m_img":1,"country_name":"Poland"}]}

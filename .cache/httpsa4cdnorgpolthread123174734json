Here&#039;s the Tirana Platform<br>http:\/\/macedoniaonline.eu\/content\/v<wbr>iew\/31585\/1\/<br>The first segment is unacceptable for multiple reasons. In 2001 after the war\/conflict the Macedonians changed their constitution with the Ohrid Treaty to allow the use of minority&#039;s languages in municipalities which had 20% or more as an official language but only in those municipalities not on a state level. Since they didnt have a single municipality in the country with more than 20% the Macedonians allowed them to remodel the borders of the municipalities and now they have that percentage in some parts of western Macedonia.<br>The Albanians have boycotted all census attempts since 2002 because they want to use an old model for headcounting which isn&#039;t recognized anywhere in the world, they want to count people living in other countries (Albania, Kosovo and some EU countries as well as Switzerland) and present them as citizens of Macedonia even though they dont live there anymore, so basically they want 1 person to be counted in 5 countries at once. Internationally accepted census rules state that if a person lives outside of a country for more than 12 months he must not be counted towards the census. Despite this being ridiculous, and in good faith with the intention to ease the relations with the Albanians, the Macedonians allowed them to use this model in 2002 and it turned out that 25% of the population is Albanian.","time":1493383554,"resto":123174734,"id":"FLFf2tw2","country":"MK","country_name":"Macedonia"},{"no":123190047,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)08:46:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123190017\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123190017<\/a><br>The Macedonians themselves didn&#039;t count their diaspora like the Albanians did, because if they did they would constitute over 90% of the population since there are more than 6 million Macedonians living outside the country. In 2014 the Albanians boycotted another census attempt after a preliminary German study revealed that their number is no more than 17.8%. That&#039;s when the crisis started because with that number the Ohrid treaty simply falls flat on the ground.<br>Since the beginning the Macedonians have taken many steps to cater to the Albanian minority. They even let the rebels who fought in the 2001 war, the same rebels who openly to this day negate the country, the Macedonian people, its language and its culture, the same rebels (even the word rebels is sugarcoating it, normally these people are called terrorists everywhere in the world) who committed war crimes and atrocities over the population, the same rebels that the Macedonian Government pardoned them for war crimes and protected them from The International Criminal Court in The Hague, now those same rebels are sitting in the Parliament, openly discuss about federalization, openly negate Macedonians in the Parliament and paint themselves as victims. If this were to happen in any other nation, the people of that nation would not have peaceful protest like the Macedonians but they would be violent, perhaps even grow into an ethnic war. So despite being mocked and insulted on every level in their own country, the Macedonians still protest very peacefully on the streets and simply ask the Albanians to stop this nationalistic rhetoric and if they so wish to redefine the country, they can do that even with a document created in another country, which I will stress again: it breaks international laws, but only if they put this Tirana Platform in front of the electorate since it simply didn&#039;t exist before the elections and people were unaware of it and didn&#039;t vote for it.","time":1493383577,"resto":123174734,"id":"FLFf2tw2","country":"MK","country_name":"Macedonia"},{"no":123190200,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)08:47:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123190047\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123190047<\/a><br>Then there&#039;s the biggest issue: declaring genocide over Albanians from 1912-1956 but doesnt provide any facts nor it says who committed it. The census during this time clearly shows slight increase in Albanian population from 9% to 14% according to the Macedonian National Archive, numbers which correspond to other census data you will find in other archives in all other countries. The reason this stays in the platform is to paint themselves as a constitutional people on the same level as the Macedonians but because of this alleged genocide their numbers are so few now, on which basis they can ask for federalization. Lets not even go further than that, what a genocide means, what compensation they can ask for it and all the implications of a genocide.<br>Its a clever document to say the least, if it wasnt for the blatant lies and foul way of doing it. The other points in the platform which deal with economy etc are ok though, no one can complains about them.<br>The elections were won by VMRO (51 seats out of 120) and even though they could have formed a government, they refused it because the Tirana Platform was a deal breaker. Based on the 2001 Ohrid treaty, the winning party must form a coalition with at least 1 Albanian party and since all Albanian Parties refuse to form a coalition with anyone unless the Tirana Platform is accepted VMRO couldnt get 61 seats to form a Government. Basically this is blackmail and totally undemocratic, but as always Macedonians are willing to accommodate their Albanian minority. The second largest party, SDSM (49 seats) announced that they accept the platform and having formed a coalition of 67 seats together with the Albanian Parties they went to the President to get the Mandate to form a Government. However the President refused it on the basis that the Platform is illegal, it breaks international law and that its damaging to the sovereignty of the country, something he swore on inaugural day to protect.","time":1493383671,"resto":123174734,"id":"FLFf2tw2","country":"MK","country_name":"Macedonia"},{"no":123190263,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)08:48:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123190200\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123190200<\/a><br>So he advised for holding another elections to sort this whole thing out.

So SDSM along with the Albanian parties are creating the crisis, they have a legal way of getting out of this situation by either holding another election cycle or simply taking the President to Constitutional court, but simply refuse to do it, claiming they have a majority for Government Mandate, refusing to acknowledge the fact that their voters didnt vote for Tirana platform.","time":1493383706,"resto":123174734,"id":"FLFf2tw2","country":"MK","country_name":"Macedonia"},{"no":123190322,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)08:49:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123189348\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123189348<\/a><br>desu, i wouldn&#039;t mind a war.","time":1493383744,"resto":123174734,"id":"kkG+Cjwo","country":"MK","country_name":"Macedonia"},{"no":123190413,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)08:49:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123190263\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123190263<\/a><br>The reason why they dont want another election is simple, now that the people know at which lengths SDSM is willing to go to get the Mandate to form a Government and that they accept the Tirana Platform, their rating has plummeted from 30% down to 15% in just over a month. That is a clear signal that half their voters dont accept the Tirana platform.<br>Another problem is that in the last 2 years there were alot of financial scandals surrounding some high members of VMRO. Corruption is undeniably high in Macedonia, somewhat less so than in Bulgaria, Albania or Kosovo for instance, but still on a high level. When SDSM had the rule, they had equal if not higher number of scandals, so thats not something only VMRO is guilty of. I&#039;d argue corruption is high even in developed democracies (just look at Germany prior to Merkel and now France, Italy, Spain etc), but that&#039;s besides the point.<br>SDSM&#039;s narrative now is that the President along with the 250k people protesting on the streets are protecting VMRO from going to court over these scandals and that VMRO is creating the crisis. Which couldn&#039;t be further from the truth, since the ex prime minister and leader of VMRO, accepted to let SDSM take the Government Mandate, that VMRO with its 51 seats will support SDSM for any legislation they want to pass in the Parliement in the next 4 years, he even agreed to be held responsible for all the scandals, that he will accept to be taken to court and prosecuted as long as SDSM rejects the Tirana Platform.<br>The crisis can be resolved in 3 ways:<br>-taking the President to court for his decision not not give the Mandate, which SDSM doesnt do.","time":1493383796,"resto":123174734,"id":"FLFf2tw2","country":"MK","country_name":"Macedonia"},{"no":123190508,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)08:50:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123190413\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123190413<\/a><br>-SDSM to reject the Tirana Platform<br>-SDSM to vote in Parliement for new elections<br>Clearly SDSM blocks the democratic process since they hold all the cards for a legal way of resolving the crisis, however knowing that they cant repeat the election fraud with the Tirana platform they refuse to do it legally and demand to form a Government calling the 250k people on the streets who are protesting 40 days in a row nazis for protecting criminals. Nothing stops them from taking those few VMRO members to court if they accept to solve the crisis legally, those 250k people protesting don&#039;t care about protecting few criminals, they simply want new elections to put the Tirana Platform before the electorate. As for the criminals, they will go to jail and I think they should keep protesting until those are behind bars, but first they need to deal with a bigger form of criminal: election fraud that aims to redefine the country without the will of the people.<br>The protesters ain&#039;t stupid, they know that if they are declared genocidal (along with the Serbs who openly stated they wil lgo to war with us if that were to happen, rightfully so I would say) and the country is redefined there&#039;s no going back after that point.

This shit happened 2500 years ago who the hell knows for sure?

Greece is salty because of the name, which part of me understands. Bulgaria thinks its their rightful clay because Tsar Samuil incorporated Macedonia into the Bulgarian Empire during the 10th century. Albania thinks it belongs to them because WE WUZ ILLYRIANS and the entire balkans are rightfully theirs.

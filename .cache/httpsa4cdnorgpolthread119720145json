Nor will<br>they stop Iran from improving the crucial part of any nuclear weapons program \u2014 the capability<br><br>to enrich uranium. At best, the talks between the world&#039;s major powers and Iran that began in<br>Istanbul this April and will continue in Baghdad in May will enable Israel to postpone by a few<br>months a decision whether to launch an attack on Iran that could provoke a major Mideast war.<br><br>Iran&#039;s nuclear program and Syria&#039;s civil war may seem unconnected, but they are. For Israeli<br>leaders, the real threat from a nuclear-armed Iran is not the prospect of an insane Iranian leader<br>launching an unprovoked Iranian nuclear attack on Israel that would lead to the annihilation of<br>both countries. What Israeli military leaders really worry about -- but cannot talk about -- is losing their nuclear monopoly. An Iranian nuclear weapons capability would not only end that<br>nuclear monopoly but could also prompt other adversaries, like Saudi Arabia and Egypt, to go<br>nuclear as well. The result would be a precarious nuclear balance in which Israel could not<br>respond to provocations with conventional military strikes on Syria and Lebanon, as it can today.<br>If Iran were to reach the threshold of a nuclear weapons state, Tehran would find it much easier<br><br>to call on its allies in Syria and Hezbollah to strike Israel, knowing that its nuclear weapons<br>would serve as a deterrent to Israel responding against Iran itself.<br><br><br>lol holy shit wtf","time":1491466069,"resto":119720145,"id":"P+XJMGqg","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":119720325,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)04:08:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119720254\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119720254<\/a><br>Ikr fucking hell","time":1491466132,"resto":119720145,"id":"UkN4qY5j","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119720360,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)04:09:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"Shut the fuck up shill. <br>Goddamn jew kike globalist satanist scum","time":1491466172,"resto":119720145,"id":"33KypzOZ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119720405,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)04:10:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119720360\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119720360<\/a><br>It&#039;s in the email fuckwit","time":1491466215,"resto":119720145,"id":"UkN4qY5j","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119720414,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)04:10:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119720325\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119720325<\/a><br><br>Its funny because even if you want to believe Putin is the bad guy reality keeps preventing this narrative from tanking hold in the mind of any informed brained being","time":1491466227,"resto":119720145,"id":"P+XJMGqg","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":119720503,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)04:11:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119720414\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119720414<\/a><br>Nah Putin is based","filename":"IMG_0192","ext":".jpg","w":597,"h":392,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":82,"tim":1491466315398,"time":1491466315,"md5":"tMfjjLPtB\/EaBa+vGgRDfw==","fsize":31124,"resto":119720145,"id":"UkN4qY5j","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119720539,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)04:12:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119720145\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119720145<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Red Line<\/span><br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=avQ<wbr>KLRGRhPU","time":1491466352,"resto":119720145,"id":"HMV90tWf","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

They are denounced and reviled globally. They have no influence. <br><br>Muslim &quot;extremists&quot; instead get funding and support from many Islamic governments, are far more prominent, far more organised, far more numerous, they have a hand in governments representing millions, they are present from the hearth of Western Europe to the tropical islands of Oceania. They are part of a religion which was founded by a warlord, which raided Christian lands for centuries, obliterated local cultures and felt justified in trading slaves and state-sponsored piracy up until the late 19th century, long after Christians had all but abolished these awful practices wherever they could. <br><br>You&#039;re talking about a religion so violent the only reason it hasn&#039;t conquered the entire world yet is because they try to massacre eachother as much as they try to massacre us. You&#039;re talking about a religion which once nearly conquered much of Southern Europe, slaughtering thousands in the way. You&#039;re talking about a religion so vile and expansive that even the Bhuddists of Bhurma say genocide against them is justified. You&#039;re talking about a religion which AS I AM WRITING THIS POST, is killing people in dozens of countries at the same time. <br><br>Before this day is over, a Muslim will blow himself up. Before the week is over, Pakistani Muslims will hold rallies demanding the release of a murderer who killed an apostate. An Indonesian Muslim will draft legislation to limit the rights of religious minorities. A Saudi Muslim will rape and beat his forced marriage wife. A Libyan Muslim will extort hundreds of Africans out of everything they have and put them on a leaky boat going into Europe. Turkish Muslims will campaign to decrease democratic oversight for Erdogan, and Muslims in general will cheer whenever the West suffers a terror attack.","filename":"1453469117558","ext":".jpg","w":1500,"h":2500,"tn_w":75,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490365683642,"time":1490365683,"md5":"ieFTClJXtn33MT6F17FKSA==","fsize":839656,"resto":118084119,"id":"tWt7YA5K","country":"BE","m_img":1,"country_name":"Belgium"}]}

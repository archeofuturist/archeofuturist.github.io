When we sweat, bacteria break down the oils and chemicals of our bodies and they create unique scents. Everyone&#039;s bacterial colonies are unique to their body, so it&#039;s a mix of diet, bacteria and genetics. Those who grow up around eachother will acquire similar bacteria, when you&#039;re born, you acquire bacteria from your mother.<br><br>Those bacteria are passed down from birth to birth and other nonsense, so they smell different, because they&#039;re different. Their race came from a place with different foods and bacteria and that carried along with them over generations, etc. <br>Something like that I&#039;d imagine.","time":1493704451,"resto":123734023,"id":"8SduB2uN","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123734933,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)01:58:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123734380\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123734380<\/a><br>Shit, that&#039;s funny<br><br>It does kind of remind me of the one black guy at my work. You can always smell him before you see him, not necessarily because of a stinking sweat smell or anything, but because he wears so much god damn body spray. The kind that gives you an astringent peppery couch when you smell it, like too much axe or some shit. It&#039;s just awful and eye watering and I almost wish he smelled like sweat and shit over this acrid compound.

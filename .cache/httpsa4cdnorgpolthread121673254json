Bulgarian youths should stay and work in Bulgaria, raise bulgarian children and actively participate in the betterment of our country. It&#039;s a shame, almost half of the students in our most prestigious schools, the better half sadly, immediately leave the country once they graduate high school in order to study abroad. I could have also done the same thing myself, but I have decided that I belong in this country, with all its positive and negative aspects, and I will dedicate my life to making Bulgaria a prosperous and respected country, if God has blessed me with the ability to do so.","time":1492516288,"resto":121673254,"id":"HTN6MxP\/","country":"BG","country_name":"Bulgaria"},{"no":121675715,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)07:53:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121673254\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121673254<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;romanians<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;slavs<\/span><br>inb4 calling us gypsies wouldn&#039;t make a differences","time":1492516415,"resto":121673254,"id":"R1TGgHnX","country":"RO","country_name":"Romania"}]}

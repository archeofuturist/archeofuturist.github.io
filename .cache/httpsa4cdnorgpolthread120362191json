Braindead. Lemme give you a tip so you can make it in this cyber sanctuary: never make statements like that. You got no reputation here, you got no name, you got jackshit here. It&#039;s survival of the fittest and you ain&#039;t gonna survive long on 4chan by saying stupid shit that your little hugbox cuntsucking reddit friends would upboat. None of that here. You don&#039;t upboat. You don&#039;t downboat. This ain&#039;t reddit, kid. This is 4chan. We have REAL intellectual discussion, something I don&#039;t think you&#039;re all that familiar with. You don&#039;t like it, you can hit the bricks on over to imgur, you daily show watching son of a bitch. I hope you don&#039;t tho. I hope you stay here and learn our ways. Things are different here, unlike any other place that the light of internet pop culture reaches. You can be anything here. Me ? heh, I&#039;m a judge.. this place.... this place has a lot to offer... heh you&#039;ll see, kid . . . that is if you can handle it...","time":1491784135,"resto":120362191,"id":"vRdRcTCk","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"}]}

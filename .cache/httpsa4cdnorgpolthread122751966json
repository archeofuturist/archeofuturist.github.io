There are several obvious indicators which allow you to recognize a Redditor quickly. I&#039;ll get to that in a moment.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Why are Redditors bad?<\/span><br><br>This is one of the more debated questions on \/pol\/. Many posters believe the influx of Redditors allows \/pol\/ to &quot;red pill&quot; more normies. This is simply not the case. Unfortunately, the majority of Redditors treat 4chan as a shitposting playground and have ZERO intention of migrating permanently into and positively contributing to the 4chan community. You see this every day on r\/4chan and r\/The_Donald where frequent &quot;visits&quot; to 4chan are screenshot and posted on subreddit. 4chan, to the curious quasi-nerd on Reddit (AKA normie), is simply a novelty rather than an established community worth being a part of.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;How do I know who is Redditor?<\/span><br><br>This one is simple! I&#039;m not going to discuss the obvious ones like &quot;Black people vs. niggers&quot; and &quot;Civic nationalism&quot;.

A cute frog with a shit eating grin to express his satisfaction after a successful troll! This is completely acceptable on 4chan, right? Wrong! Frogposting has been normalized since &quot;feels good man&quot; and &quot;sadfrog&quot; was hijacked by knowyourmeme.com &quot;researchers&quot; and dubbed it collectively as &quot;pepe&quot; (&quot;But, that was his name in the original furry comics, I researched it!!!!&quot; -a redditor) This was WAY before Katy Perry sent \/r9k\/ into a frenzy. Frogposting also includes Kekposting, an r\/The_Donald favorite.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Use of memes\/Acknowledgement of memes\/Positive discussion about memes<\/span><br>If you look on any of the less frequented boards, memes and the word &quot;meme&quot; itself carry a very negative connotation. Memes are now seen as normie pop-culture consumption. This is something Reddit doesn&#039;t understand. People from r\/The_Donald embarrass themselves in public with signs and shirts with memes and everyone here laughs at them. It is no secret that normies love memes. Tons of public &quot;meme&quot; pages on social media churn out millions of half-assed memes per day and normies share them in the billions per day. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Happeningfags<\/span><br>Newfags and Redditors love &quot;HABBENINGS XD&quot;. Redditors just love when 4chan &quot;FrEaKs OuT&quot; over something. Fortunately, for oldfags, the novelty of happening threads wore off once every &quot;Happening&quot; turned out to be bullshit. Sure, at first everyone enjoyed LARPing in happening threads, but not one true anon has continued to get intoxicated by the hype. Personally, I&#039;ve filtered happening threads since 2013. I&#039;ve never looked back.","time":1493137761,"resto":122751966,"id":"3T85Ue2H","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122752086,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)12:29:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"D+C kike","time":1493137770,"resto":122751966,"id":"dY5WSRXN","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122752104,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)12:29:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122752067\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122752067<\/a><br><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Social Media screenshots<\/span><br>Other than frogposting, this is one of the easiest ways to spot a Redditor.

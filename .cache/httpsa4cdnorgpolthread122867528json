I live in the Bay Area and, as everybody already knows, housing here is an absolute catastrophe. We&#039;re such a densely populated area already since having 3 major metropolitan cities separated by a huge bay means that people either live near their jobs or they commute for multiple hours every day. And there seems to be more and more people moving here every day. What do you think would happen if we suddenly lost 1\/3 of our population? Like some catastrophic disease wiped out a third of the working class here? <br><br>First, real estate prices would absolutely plummet. Anybody who bought a house here recently would lose anywhere from $300k to $5,000,000 depending on what area the house is in.<br>Second, businesses would be rocked by the dual shock of losing skilled laborers and losing a huge amount of customers.<br>Third, all those nifty welfare checks we love to give out here would dry up faster than Hillary when she saw the election results.<br><br>The liberal paradise of San Francisco would be hit so hard that even Detroit will mock us.<br><br>Now I wonder what could cause 1\/3 of the workforce to vanish... maybe something like banning H-1B visas, ending sanctuary cities, and deporting the illegal Mexicans &amp; Chinese? But who would do something like that?<br><br>The God Emperor is using his real estate prowess to wage economic warfare on the left and it&#039;s going to be a surprise attack","filename":"Screen Shot 2017-04-26 at 1.44.07 AM","ext":".png","w":677,"h":389,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":143,"tim":1493201054970,"time":1493201054,"md5":"n+SoXv5WvjF0KDbk3L+57w==","fsize":54951,"resto":0,"id":"RRDmbuwA","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"trump-launched-the-first-strike-in-the-new-civil","country_name":"United States","replies":6,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":122867560,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)06:04:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"Trump has talked about this bubble before.<br><br>http:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2016\/04\/04\/cram<wbr>er-donald-trump-is-right-theres-a-b<wbr>ubble.html","time":1493201090,"resto":122867528,"id":"RRDmbuwA","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122867771,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)06:07:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122867528\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122867528<\/a><br><br>Just &quot;reroute&quot; the water deliveries back to Nevada and Arizona, whose water it rightfully is","time":1493201275,"resto":122867528,"id":"1t6w\/+gB","country":"RS","country_name":"Serbia"},{"no":122867921,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)06:10:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122867771\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122867771<\/a><br>Get out of here you dirty serb.

To award these reasonable costs the trier of fact must find that the defendant&#039;s claim of self-defense was sustained by a preponderance of the evidence. If the trier of fact makes a determination of self-defense, the judge shall determine the amount of the award.<br>(3) Notwithstanding a finding that a defendant&#039;s actions were justified by self-defense, if the trier of fact also determines that the defendant was engaged in criminal conduct substantially related to the events giving rise to the charges filed against the defendant the judge may deny or reduce the amount of the award. In determining the amount of the award, the judge shall also consider the seriousness of the initial criminal conduct.<br>Nothing in this section precludes the legislature from using the sundry claims process to grant an award where none was granted under this section or to grant a higher award than one granted under this section.<br>(4) Whenever the issue of self-defense under this section is decided by a judge, the judge shall consider the same questions as must be answered in the special verdict under subsection (4) [(5)] of this section.","time":1491272986,"resto":119412274,"id":"1xbyLC8E","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119418379,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)22:30:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119412274\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119412274<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The &quot;&quot;victim&quot;&quot; was identified as Nathaniel Joseph Rosa<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;(((Rosa)))<\/span><br>he has to go back (in a box)","filename":"trump-you-have-got-to-go-back-yes-you-pedro","ext":".png","w":712,"h":468,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":82,"tim":1491273008464,"time":1491273008,"md5":"y3YWPdGsshUpkACEbFETZw==","fsize":388406,"resto":119412274,"id":"XnYUXkGT","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119418527,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)22:31:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119417874\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119417874<\/a><br>Fookin hell m8<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;your mind turns to the gun sitting upstairs in your closet<\/span><br>You mean resting by my right elbow?<br>What&#039;s your plan if someone breaks in.

However, two thirds of burglaries are committed by people known to the victims, so if you don&#039;t hang around with criminals the actual rate is 1:375. And these are the stats for America overall. It includes every ghetto, all the cities like Detroit where no sane white person would live. So if you&#039;re just living in a normal neighbourhood the chances of your home being broken into are definitely less than 1:375, probably significantly so since a relatively small number of high-crime areas tend to skew statistics.

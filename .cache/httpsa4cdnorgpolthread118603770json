I mostly come here to keep myself up to date with the latest \/pol\/ cancer. I used 4chan back in 2010, it&#039;s quite funny how people can only act when spurned by ideology. Although, I was already use to Atheists giving me a hard time. Now, it&#039;s a new group of people giving me a hard time, the only problem is this new group might try to kill me, but I feel pretty safe in America since we have other ethnic groups here in high density(Latinos, Asians, and Indians). Europe seems like a trap, tbqh. It seems like Europeans are fattening up Muslims in order to roast them in some diabolical scheme. At this point, I can only hope for deportation when the right wing PERHAPS wins in Europe.","filename":"hegel","ext":".jpg","w":309,"h":400,"tn_w":96,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490674157317,"time":1490674157,"md5":"dWzHqRQ7TmPOqfQaZddsgQ==","fsize":39522,"resto":118603770,"id":"OcgnlOFr","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

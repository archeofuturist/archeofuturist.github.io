I don&#039;t know if the matter of the false flag is completely settled or not, but it&#039;s exciting because Trump took the option that would provide him with the best possible outcome no matter whether it&#039;s true or not. The US intelligence community, and the UN, are pushing hard that Assad&#039;s behind it, so his action had to be taken within those measures. Yet he did it in a way that caused minimal collateral damage and no harm to Russia beyond a little expected fur ruffling. If it turns out it WAS actually a false flag, Trump can blame the intelligence community and drain their swamp, and no serious harm done to Russia. If it turns out it&#039;s NOT, then Trump gets to be lauded as the brilliant Commander who took out the chemical weapons while pinning all the blame on the failed Obama administration AND SUSAN RICE for lying about\/failing to ensure Syria&#039;s chems were completely removed liked they promised.

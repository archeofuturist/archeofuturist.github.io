People left and right constantly claim that &quot;Christianity was just as violent once, too&quot; and that &quot;Islam just needs to calm down like the Christians did&quot;. No. You people have a completely asinine view of how religion works and why these problems arose. The Crusades and Inquisition WEREN&#039;T CHRISTIAN. The papacy was a corrupt and immoral institution due to the unification of church and state, and they actually had to BAN the Bible in order to prevent anyone from recognizing how absolutely bullshit their doctrine of control was. But hey, let&#039;s build on that. You know why the Crusades started? BECAUSE ISLAM HAD BEEN PILLAGING, RAPING, BEHEADING, AND BURNING CHURCHES FOR THE 400 YEARS IT HAD EXISTED. And that&#039;s continued for the 1000 years since the Crusades as well. Just look at the Ottomans. Islam will never &quot;calm down like the Christians&quot; or adhere to Western morality, which thankfully has rooted itself in Christianity until recent. The Quran and Hadith have HUNDREDS of verses commanding and assuring the actions of ISIS and everyone who&#039;s done the same for the past 1400 years. They even have theological argument to verify that suicide bombing is forgiven. Wake up. Christianity didn&#039;t &#039;go warmongering&#039; and then relax. Read the Bible. &#039;Christianity&#039; as an actual worldview has always been about love, spirituality, and forgiveness.","time":1490846221,"resto":118875933,"id":"2DNsVjig","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118882035,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)00:23:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118879141\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118879141<\/a><br>#notallchristians","time":1490847831,"resto":118875933,"id":"xUosPsLH","country":"IN","country_name":"India"}]}

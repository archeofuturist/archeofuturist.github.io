The same employees make sandwiches, specialty coffee, and then ring out customers. This is terribly inefficient for non-food customers and also unsanitary for those ordering food. They handle money with gloves on then go touch food because they think the gloves make everything OK. I stopped going there. Every Sheetz I&#039;ve been to separates the cashiers from the food preppers. Both really suck, though. The food quality has really gone down since they first started opening Sheetz all over PA. Sheetz used to be above fast-food quality and now I feel it&#039;s below. Wawa&#039;s food is really the same tier. Both specialty coffees are not worth what they charge. They are both like a Subway in a gas station (which we also have a few of) and I will forever refuse to eat at such a place.<br><br>My CAPTCHA was about gas stations.","time":1492985115,"resto":122494714,"id":"0EXEq+mN","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122496758,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)18:09:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122496175\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122496175<\/a><br>Where you?

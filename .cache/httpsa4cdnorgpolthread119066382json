That makes the average rating for The Leather Special1.35 stars.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Sadly, a chunk of these negative reviews can be attributed to misogyny \u2013 female comics are frequently criticized for making certain jokes that men make all the time \u2013 but a large percentage of these terrible reviews are being written by self-proclaimed Schumer supporters.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Amy Schumer has to deal with a ridiculous amount of sexist bullshit on an everyday basis, reviews for Netflix standup specials aren\u2019t really useful unless they\u2019re used to attack or boycott someone, and going forward, when a standup special suddenly gets tanked by hundreds of negative online reviews from supposed \u201cfans,\u201d their legitimacy is probably worth double-checking over on Reddit, where said \u201cfans\u201d have a whole lot more free time on their hands to attack and harass people than Amy Schumer.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Call me a whale.

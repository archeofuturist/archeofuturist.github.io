Actually, we voted Leave, but I know Tory safe seats and those affluent Tory Remainers you mentioned. They have no love for the EU. They are pragmatists, not dogmatists. Remaining in the EU may have seemed pragmatic at the time, but blocking Brexit now that we&#039;ve voted Leave and Article 50&#039;s been triggered definitely isn&#039;t. And they hate the kind of plebs who have been protesting in London and in media and won&#039;t want to be associated with it. They are not the Lib Dem&#039;s target market. My personal election prediction is that Tories will regain Richmond.","time":1492556321,"resto":121751328,"id":"nC1MhRs\/","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121756315,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)18:58:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121755402\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121755402<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Still, my constituency is a pretty big labour stronghold unfortunately<\/span><br>Exactly.

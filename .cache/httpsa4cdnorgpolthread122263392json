Communism was a system created for the sole goal of abuse and manipulation by jews. Capitalism is somewhat salvagble as non jews can actually acomplish shit and gain riches\/power to oppose the jews. In communism non jews can&#039;t do anything to the jews because they can&#039;t even get power\/riches in the fit&#039;s place if jews don&#039;t let them. That&#039;s the real problem with communism. Even if an &quot;real&quot; communism was ever succesfully implemented then it could still be taken over by jews pretty easily compared to capitalism and then everything gets fucked","time":1492861644,"resto":122263392,"id":"oKvdqGY\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122268966,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)07:52:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122268476\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122268476<\/a><br>Marcuse had very little to do with modern idpol.

I think that is factually wrong if you read the History of communist youth movements during the cold war and the cultural revolution. Members were explicitely asked to infiltrate the spheres of influence and subvert them for their cause. An interesting example of this is the whole New Labour project in the UK which was filled to the brim with allegedly ex-communists. And lo and behold, New Labour was one of the most radical post-Cold War government that ever was, achieving many of the aims of the revolutionary student generation. I guess his point is that Marxists couldn&#039;t have possibly infiltrated many spheres of power, or else we would be all living under Marxism, but of course that doesn&#039;t mean they haven&#039;t tried.<br><br>Another small point is his point about the American dream. He uses the meme &quot;temporarily dispossed millionaires&quot; which we have all seen from that one image with that particular quote. Of course, that is wrong, as the American dream was to join the middle-class, own a home and a car and have 2.5 children, not becomig a millionaire. <br><br>But the elephant in the room is that he never, ever once mentionned the one thing that the Left and Marxists have viciously attacked (or maybe he did, I had to close the video at the drinking bleach part) and that is Christianity -- Christian morality and culture. Gramsci himself warned Marxists that Christian workers were not defined by capitalist oppressors but by their faith-based culture. Christianity -- because it is fundamentaly opposed to the utopian ideologies of free market capitalism and communism -- has always been enemy #1 to Marxists, even more so then capitalism. The USSR allowed small business to open a decade before churches.","time":1492865687,"resto":122263392,"id":"5bzipNn9","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":122274089,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)08:55:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122273918\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122273918<\/a><br>Ellul, friggin hell, the guy is amazing.

Communism was a system created for the sole goal of abuse and manipulation by jews. Capitalism is somewhat salvagble as non jews can actually acomplish shit and gain riches\/power to oppose the jews. In communism non jews can&#039;t do anything to the jews because they can&#039;t even get power\/riches in the fit&#039;s place if jews don&#039;t let them. That&#039;s the real problem with communism. Even if an &quot;real&quot; communism was ever succesfully implemented then it could still be taken over by jews pretty easily compared to capitalism and then everything gets fucked","time":1492861644,"resto":122263392,"id":"oKvdqGY\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122268966,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)07:52:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122268476\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122268476<\/a><br>Marcuse had very little to do with modern idpol.

Airbus(which employ 15,000+ people) has wanted to move fully continental for years, but has been stopped by politics (they want to leave Spain as well fyi). Additionally, unless provided for in negotiations, the UK defense industry will be outside of tender obligations for EU military purchases. <br><br>With the new proposed EU army, and a harmonized EU defense industry, they&#039;ve just created a giant market they can&#039;t tap, and a gigantic competitor they can&#039;t beat.<br><br>2)Most of the defense industry imports it&#039;s raw materials. Any fall of the pound will not help these exports, because the UK has barely any steel, aluminum,electronics industry left. They will have to pay more for any new raw materials. The Defense industry has warned that currency risk is their biggest worry. Not to mention that they will be politically cut out of any and all purchase agreements in Europe from now on.<br>3)Most defense\/aerospace purchases are political. The British interests, were EU interests, so the EU allowed them to bribe the Saudi&#039;s, and the Saudi&#039;s hoped to get EU and UK influence for these purchases. Now, the Saudi&#039;s will get only diminishing UK influence for this. I predict we&#039;ll see much more purchases from German etc. weapon manufacturers from now on, as the rest of the World understand that the UK only represents itself and it&#039;s diminished sphere. I don&#039;t think the Arab&#039;s are too concerned about getting Barbados on board with it&#039;s purchases.","time":1490873390,"resto":118908232,"id":"Q9Bzktr4","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":118912191,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)07:29:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118911944\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118911944<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;influence is only about money<\/span><br>How jewish are you?

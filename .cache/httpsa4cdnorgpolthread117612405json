Those are the bare minimum, however. There is nothing Islamic about restricting women only to those rights given to us by the Quran, after all, in Islam, if it is not prohibited, it is should be allowed.<br><br>There are, however, obligations which women have towards men, husbands especially, that some find contentious. For example, men are the head of the household, and women should obey their husband, except when he does something sacreligious. <br><br>The hijab was mandated for women because Prophet Muhammad often grew agitated by the way that men publically lusted after women. He publically forced men to avert their eyes when he caught them staring at women on many many occasions. The hijab verse was revealed after one of the companions goaded Muhammad into seeking guidance on the issue by stalking the Prophet&#039;s wife. It tells women to draw their cloaks over their heads, only revealing the face, hands, and feet. While it is clear the intention was to divert men&#039;s attention away from women, in a modern context, religious dress is frowned upon. As long as people arent being forced to wear hijab (I do), then it&#039;s fine. IMO, forcing women to wear hijab is actually anti-Islamic, just as a believing woman failing to cover herself is.","time":1490092708,"resto":117612405,"id":"J4fvGJzQ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117614475,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)07:02:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"Classic.","time":1490094172,"resto":117612405,"id":"w1UjWAPk","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117615061,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)07:13:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117613009\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117613009<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Forcing women to wear hijab is anti-Islamic,<\/span><br><br>Are all islamic countries and communities anti-islamic?","time":1490094811,"resto":117612405,"id":"iCakgOg3","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":117615122,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)07:14:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117612405\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117612405<\/a>","filename":"1489238545194","ext":".jpg","w":680,"h":959,"tn_w":88,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490094883835,"time":1490094883,"md5":"ziPSqsHxJFWDHDfVj6A4ww==","fsize":90090,"resto":117612405,"id":"ODSKKxe7","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117615147,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)07:15:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117612405\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117612405<\/a><br><br>Feminists consider this to be empowering, as they can control men&#039;s sexual desire by covering themselves.","time":1490094901,"resto":117612405,"id":"05e5T6v3","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":117615391,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)07:19:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117612829\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117612829<\/a><br>say what you want about the muzzies, they got some great ideas when it comes to women and fags.","time":1490095169,"resto":117612405,"id":"2DwVSYh7","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117615459,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)07:20:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117615147\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117615147<\/a><br>They can also avoid having to argue with men and explain themselves by shutting the fuck up, perhaps that&#039;s the fourth wave of feminism.","time":1490095237,"resto":117612405,"id":"iCakgOg3","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":117615501,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)07:21:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117612405\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117612405<\/a><br>degenerate","time":1490095279,"resto":117612405,"id":"FzM96j1G","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":117615535,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)07:21:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117615459\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117615459<\/a><br><a href=\"#p117615147\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117615147<\/a><br>nothing wrong with that","time":1490095309,"resto":117612405,"id":"FzM96j1G","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":117615588,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)07:22:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117613009\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117613009<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;after all, in Islam, if it is not prohibited, it is should be allowed.<\/span><br>thats not how it works<br><br>maybe arabs work that way, not th quran","time":1490095360,"resto":117612405,"id":"FzM96j1G","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":117615664,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)07:24:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"It&#039;s sad how true that picture is","time":1490095451,"resto":117612405,"id":"edDC4LwQ","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":117615739,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)07:25:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117613009\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117613009<\/a><br>A female muslim immigrant...<br>What&#039;s it like to be the most hated person on this board besides George Soros?","time":1490095533,"resto":117612405,"id":"y1AOGCP\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117615861,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)07:27:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117612405\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117612405<\/a><br>Spend your life in a cage and you&#039;ll tell me you&#039;re free<br><br>Step out of the cage realise you want to go back in","time":1490095660,"resto":117612405,"id":"\/olB9po\/","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":117615951,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)07:28:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117615061\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117615061<\/a><br>This, you can&#039;t convince anyone that the social pressures on a woman wouldn&#039;t convince her to be borderlone suicidal if she refused to wear some covering on her head.

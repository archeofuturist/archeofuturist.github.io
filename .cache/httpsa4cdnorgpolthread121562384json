The Republican Party won because they actually had a candidate go up against 15 others and come out way on top, meanwhile the best candidate in the DNC was dropped because he&#039;s a Blue Collar Old white male in favor of an atheist socialist Jew (in America unironically who thought that he had a chance even against fucking Ben Carson ) and a bitch who has controversy constantly follow her when she&#039;s in the public eye and is completely unlikeable( going back all the way to the 70s), not to mention ignored the Blue Collar wing of her party entirely just like Obama did after they voted for him twice, letting Trump steal it from her in the form of the Rustbelt. It had nothing to do with affirmative action. You faggots always bitch about the electoral system when you lose.

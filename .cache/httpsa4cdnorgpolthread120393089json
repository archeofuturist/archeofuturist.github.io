Anyone who buys this has very poor critical thinking skills. This is &quot;muh saddam killin babies in the incubators&quot; and &quot;muh iraq has wmds and is gonna nuke israel&quot; and &quot;muh qaddafi has the yellow cakes and is gonna nuke us&quot; and &quot;muh nazis gassed muh jews&quot; and so on and so forth. It&#039;s a lie, and a poor one at that.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;jared kushner is \/ourguy\/<\/span><br>No. Kushner is a lifelong democrat who is bringing in lifelong democrats. He&#039;s a member of a literal crime family. There&#039;s a reason the leftist media supports him. There&#039;s a reason Bannon, who is \/ourguy\/ called him a &quot;globalist cuck&quot;. There&#039;s a reason he&#039;s bringing in globalists and pushing out nationalists. Pay attention. <br><br>IF THE MEDIA IS SUPPORTING SOMEONE IN TRUMPS ADMINISTRATION, ASSUME THAT PERSON IS COMPROMISED<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;muh trump betrayed us<\/span><br>No. Trump is being mislead by a team of people whose motives align with those of previous administrations. Gen McMaster, who replaced Flynn, is a globalist, a terrorist apologist who hates the term &quot;islamic terrorism&quot;, he&#039;s been called &quot;Petraeus&#039; Golden Boy&quot;, is a member of the CFR -- and he wants 150k troops on the ground in Syria to toppel Assad. He doctors intelligence reports to persuade Trump into acting in the furtherance of his own agenda.","filename":"bewbs","ext":".jpg","w":652,"h":652,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491799040011,"time":1491799040,"md5":"B3+dms5QeKt5CJAqu4SPlA==","fsize":113374,"resto":0,"id":"\/Hlh3o9D","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"attn-shills","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

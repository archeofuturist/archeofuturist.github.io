I agree with my Moroccan dude here. Young people are increasingly hating islam here and I&#039;m one of them. <br>But in the case of Belgium or any other muslim community that is trying to exist in a non muslim country, they are practicing and praying more because it&#039;s what they have to do in order to exist. If they would stop those things, their children would do too and their community would become more secular and adaptive.This is a good thing of course but they think about this as a form of identity loss. This comes to the fact that &quot;If you are going to resist adaptation and try to keep your community alive, why don&#039;t you just go back to where you belong where you don&#039;t have to do that.&quot;. Those are my impressions of Turks in Germany.","filename":"1492953054215","ext":".jpg","w":648,"h":595,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":114,"tim":1493025939725,"time":1493025939,"md5":"uJDZnq4l5efJqmOR3ISEMw==","fsize":146329,"resto":122565295,"id":"aqkKDaiY","country":"TR","country_name":"Turkey"},{"no":122567293,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)05:28:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122567089\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122567089<\/a><br>Legit<br><br>Muslims abroad only practice to keep their communities strong in order to have some sort of presence in a foreign country , however it is not the case in a muslim country where we dont feel the need to do so , and by not practicing , it has become much more easier to turn away from religion all together","time":1493026126,"resto":122565295,"id":"kXIsZrNR","country":"MA","country_name":"Morocco"},{"no":122567306,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)05:28:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122565295\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122565295<\/a><br>Not in Bosnia theyre not.

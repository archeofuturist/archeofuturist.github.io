For some reason, it also broadcasts when no such alerts are happening, probably so that the receivers can check that they still are in range. The transmitter&#039;s antenna is on the same roof as our WebSDR antenna, just some 50 meters away, hence the strong signal. The signals on neighbouring frequencies are intermodulation products, which arise in the electronics of the MiniWhip antenna when it is overloaded due to the strong pager signal.","time":1491496853,"resto":119759003,"id":"Edz5cIp\/","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":119761887,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)12:49:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119759003\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119759003<\/a><br>Any frequencies you recommend?","time":1491497355,"resto":119759003,"id":"EodZTUrt","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

Today, a woman can empower herself through actions as seemingly inconsequential as driving her children to soccer practice or watching the Oxygen network.&quot;<br><br>Klein said that clothes-shopping, once considered a mundane act with few sociopolitical implications, is now a bold feminist statement.<br><br>&quot;Shopping for shoes has emerged as a powerful means by which women assert their autonomy,&quot; Klein said. &quot;Owning and wearing dozens of pairs of shoes is a compelling way for a woman to announce that she is strong and independent, and can shoe herself without the help of a man. She&#039;s saying, &#039;Look out, male-dominated world, here comes me and my shoes.&#039;&quot;<br><br>Eating energy bars specially fortified with nutrients &quot;for women&quot; has become a feminist trend, as well.<br><br>&quot;Unlike traditional, phallocentric energy bars, whose chocolate, soy protein, nuts, and granola ignored the special health and nutritional needs of women, their new, female-oriented counterparts like Luna are ideally balanced with a more suitable amount of chocolate, soy protein, nuts and granola,&quot; Klein said. &quot;Proto-feminist pioneers like Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony could never have imagined that female empowerment would one day come in bar form.&quot;","filename":"fag","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":702,"tn_w":178,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491343185040,"time":1491343185,"md5":"L8xd8MJ+cH8evVRW634bXA==","fsize":86454,"resto":0,"id":"zO\/YOPCu","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"onion-article-from-2003","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

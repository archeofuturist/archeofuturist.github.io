There is approximately 20 million illegal aliens in the US, some of them are voting. That is something that directly effects the outcome of our elections by a foreign power. Why is Russia such a big deal, and illigal aliens voting not a big deal? They have pretty much agreed Russia did not hack the actual machines we vote with, they just influence our elections via Twitter, social media, and trolls. There are actual votes from people who are not even a citizens of the US who are voting. Basically I&#039;m just trying to understand why it is ok for this group to have a say so with the election, and not ok for this other group to have a say so?","filename":"950028791112","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":500,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490891702562,"time":1490891702,"md5":"6ndnlxP\/+dnvsvh7WZbRrw==","fsize":112060,"resto":0,"id":"oNmZZolJ","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"ok-pol-maybe-you-guys-can-help-me-understand-this","country_name":"United States","replies":38,"images":20,"unique_ips":11},{"no":118937983,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)12:37:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"Booty bump for a lil bit.","filename":"1485066816717","ext":".jpg","w":2857,"h":1373,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":60,"tim":1490891856766,"time":1490891856,"md5":"M9jsVwSVGH7yUIj95dJsDQ==","fsize":1255540,"resto":118937690,"id":"oNmZZolJ","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":118938063,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)12:38:29","name":"Anonymous","filename":"1320877058458","ext":".jpg","w":445,"h":700,"tn_w":79,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490891909959,"time":1490891909,"md5":"ovKbo36869Bfkuv9oB2O7g==","fsize":52325,"resto":118937690,"id":"oNmZZolJ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118938117,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)12:39:05","name":"Anonymous","filename":"zWf3rrB","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":640,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490891945630,"time":1490891945,"md5":"\/RwZIn2KX2oIVU1gotROyQ==","fsize":92701,"resto":118937690,"id":"oNmZZolJ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118938169,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)12:39:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"Because Trump said he admires Putin and Putin is a literal dictator who has his opponents killed and imprisoned.","filename":"trollpace","ext":".png","w":5000,"h":4068,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":101,"tim":1490891970562,"time":1490891970,"md5":"1VoPpIIYr4TFpaQ3nM4RAw==","fsize":881368,"resto":118937690,"id":"MxiDg0xm","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":118938271,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)12:40:28","name":"joj the third","com":"http:\/\/vocaroo.com\/i\/s0GuaMAEHqBG","time":1490892028,"resto":118937690,"id":"dzZ8bORV","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118938292,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)12:40:41","name":"Anonymous","filename":"1475282032523","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":750,"tn_w":83,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490892041518,"time":1490892041,"md5":"X6oPVQaA07fe8Fq4odnqsg==","fsize":65022,"resto":118937690,"id":"oNmZZolJ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118938787,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)12:45:00","name":"Anonymous","filename":"1473721375036","ext":".jpg","w":3024,"h":4032,"tn_w":93,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490892300690,"time":1490892300,"md5":"eCxneSKsZCRYyw433Zt7lA==","fsize":1667041,"resto":118937690,"id":"oNmZZolJ","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":118939129,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)12:48:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118937690\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118937690<\/a><br>i voted and already came back. thanks johny dick, your system is a piece of shit, and we mexicans can decide whoever wins whenever we want, as we wil do after drumpf is impeached","time":1490892487,"resto":118937690,"id":"CtcMevFH","country":"MX","country_name":"Mexico"},{"no":118939135,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)12:48:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118938169\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118938169<\/a><br><a href=\"#p118938271\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118938271<\/a><br>I&#039;d like an actual discussion about this.","filename":"4qf4m2ARi1rmfcz8_500","ext":".gif","w":360,"h":240,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1490892491319,"time":1490892491,"md5":"fTOin2nMM\/10RCidSVbqIw==","fsize":1330490,"resto":118937690,"id":"oNmZZolJ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118939165,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)12:48:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118937690\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118937690<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Basically I&#039;m just trying to understand why it is ok for this group to have a say<\/span><br>Maybe it has something to do with the fact that they vote democrat en masse.

If you have a large enough segment with dual citizenship you can really have an impact on the host country&#039;s election and then policy. Think about all the dual citizens that hate America and proclaim their loyalties to Mexico. Isn&#039;t this a way for Mexico to interfere in the elections in a way?

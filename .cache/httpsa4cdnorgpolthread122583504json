A $120 600 watt hps setup (air cooled hood, dig ballast) is hard to beat for setup costs. But if you can solder and can justify the expense, a COB setup with Cree 3590&#039;s will certainly outperform it, and by a significant margin assuming you aim for a similar 600 watt draw from the wall.<br><br>A 630 watt lec will outperform them both though.

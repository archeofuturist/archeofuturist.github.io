Since this is even dangerous for Erdo supporters because there is no knowing who&#039;ll become the new president after he dies, most people voted against this decision. Of course with frauds and in some places with guns the referendum was won with 51%. Though Erdogan won&#039;t have these powers until he get&#039;s elected in the next elections (2019)<br><br>Now even though Erdogan got what he wanted, everyone saw that all the major cities were against this decision and that he didn&#039;t have as much power as he seemed to have. At this moment there are several protests around Turkey just like the Gezi Protests, but it will probably amount to nothing, as usual.<br><br>The possibility of a civil war in Turkey is very unlikely since people there are aware of what happened in Syria. Besides the anti-government side in Turkey is too western compared to those in arab countries. They value their own lives before all else instead of dying for their country and their Allah.<br><br>During the next two years Erdogan will probably make careful moves because he saw that his victory in the next elections isn&#039;t assured. I don&#039;t know what his plan is, but he will probably try to keep the economy stable while also giving the image that he is needed against the enemies(mostly kurds).<br><br>You should expect more strikes on kurds, while also trying to keep USA&#039;s side. People who support Erdogan feel strong hatred against Asad because &quot;he kills innocent muslim babies&quot;, so teaming up with Russia isn&#039;t a choice at this point.","time":1492489615,"resto":121601468,"id":"9h57ALLF","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121638451,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)00:34:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"my source in washington says that turkey will be targeted as soon as the syria conflict has been closed\/settled in UN.","time":1492490044,"resto":121601468,"id":"UQilXiBh","country":"DK","country_name":"Denmark"},{"no":121638750,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)00:36:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"Iraqi losses to capture Mosul after 6 months of fighting:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;9,100 men killed<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;20,000 wounded<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;879 Humvees<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;125 BMPs<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;47 tanks<\/span><br><br>Source: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=FFL<wbr>M2qfMl80&amp; [Embed]<br><br>Should&#039;ve just nuke&#039;d the city IMO.","time":1492490202,"resto":121601468,"id":"KaH5rdGM","country":"IT","country_name":"Italy"},{"no":121639190,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)00:40:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121638750\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121638750<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; 9k dead<\/span><br>That&#039;s probably an understatement","time":1492490450,"resto":121601468,"id":"RVZQO97c","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":121639275,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)00:41:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121638750\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121638750<\/a><br>Are you sure about it?

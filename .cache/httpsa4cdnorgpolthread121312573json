THAAD was never actually a kinetic missile hitting a missile system. It is actually a system that comprises of many forms of attack and relies more on having bases in close proximity to the intended targets. It&#039;s why China is so pissed about the one in SK. It&#039;s why China is suddenly so willing to cooperate with us with the norks. Their missiles are now worthless until they can figure out how to get around it and we are showing it off. Why is Trump being so aggressive right now? Because we have first strike capability against just about everyone, we are just not in the best position for a conventional war of that scale and are not in the national mood for pressing the easy mode button.","time":1492319633,"resto":121312573,"id":"0H05UY5w","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121321286,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)01:16:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if there&#039;s something like this flying around with a 100kw fiber laser.

Seongju County in North Gyeongsang Province was chosen as the site to base the THAAD, partly because it is out of range of North Korean rocket artillery along the DMZ, which sparked protests from Seongju County residents from fear of the radiation emitted by the AN\/TPY-2 radar. On 30 September 2016, the U.S. and South Korea announced that THAAD would be relocated to Lotte Skyhill Seongju Country Club, farther from the town&#039;s main residential areas and higher in elevation, to alleviate concerns.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;On 16 March 2017, a THAAD radar arrived in South Korea. The THAAD system is kept at Osan Air Base until the site where the system is due to be deployed is prepared, with an expected ready date of June 2017.<\/span>","time":1492319879,"resto":121312573,"id":"7YytAzVu","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121321461,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)01:18:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121321286\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121321286<\/a><br>remember that top secret space shuttle thing we put into orbit?","time":1492319907,"resto":121312573,"id":"0H05UY5w","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

Steve Bannon\u2019s Breitbart says Soros\u2019s funding of Black Lives Matter was part of an agenda to swing the US presidential election. The European far right claims he is trying to destroy Christian white Europe by importing Muslim refugees.&quot;<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;Lies have to be nailed. The factual record has to be defended. You should never regard it as a chore to insist on the truth. It is a duty, which if you shirk it, leaves the field clear for race baiters and dictatorial movements.&quot;<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;But playing the ball means playing the extremists\u2019 game to some extent. You treat their arguments as worthy of debate. However wrong you show them to be, you acknowledge their point of view. When you are up against dangerous men, playing the ball is not enough. You must play the man, too, and expose not just what he says but why he says it.&quot;<\/span>","filename":"oy vey its anudda shoa","ext":".png","w":748,"h":633,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":211,"tim":1492358313249,"time":1492358313,"md5":"8hLNd6uNblWI\/rySvWRQRg==","fsize":511216,"resto":0,"id":"klX33kF3","country":"HU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"nick-cohen-the-dirty-tricks-that-demonise-george","country_name":"Hungary","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

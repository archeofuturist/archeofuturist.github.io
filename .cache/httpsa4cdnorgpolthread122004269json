Good for most domestic topics, but his views on foreign policy are neoconish.","time":1492705443,"resto":122004269,"id":"n430e6bG","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122010783,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)12:27:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122004931\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122004931<\/a><br>No he actually brings that up in one of his shows (I don&#039;t remember which one, Death Throes of the Republic I think) and then calls it completely ridiculous.","time":1492705648,"resto":122004269,"id":"8XWM3lIM","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122010857,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)12:28:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"I like Lars Brownworth for history Norman Centuries is excellent.","time":1492705688,"resto":122004269,"id":"BCrjuOyz","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122011329,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)12:32:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"BOADAHS LANGUAGE CAULTURE","time":1492705952,"resto":122004269,"id":"XyxlYS0y","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122012235,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)12:40:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"Chapo trap house<br> theyre so funny XD","time":1492706453,"resto":122004269,"id":"h7dOwyIG","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122013445,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)12:53:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"&quot;The Last Podcast On The Left&quot; (true crime\/mystery\/conspiracy\/history\/co<wbr>medy podcast from NYC)","filename":"tlpotl","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":500,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492707186711,"time":1492707186,"md5":"3MC9hLIC8Z6E8iIP6\/fg8A==","fsize":109586,"resto":122004269,"id":"d8Jzn2Qg","country":"AT","country_name":"Austria"},{"no":122013836,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)12:57:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"The Jason Stapleton Program<br>The Survival Podcast<br>Liberty First by KrisAnne Hall<br>In The Rabbit Hole-Urban Survival PC","time":1492707439,"resto":122004269,"id":"lAn12m2U","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122014399,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)13:02:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"I listen to a lot of shows from dark myths collective <br><br>The eastern border<br>Dangerous history podcast<br>Martyr made (really good, discusses how modern day Israel came to be)<br>All of them are pretty good. <br>Someone else mentioned Lars Brown, that&#039;s a good one.","time":1492707772,"resto":122004269,"id":"l3Pd81jQ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122014427,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)13:03:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"NO AGENDA<br>O<br><br>A<br>G<br>E<br>N<br>D<br>A","filename":"OOV7Xk9uMB","ext":".png","w":512,"h":512,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492707791899,"time":1492707791,"md5":"wH4Iww2gB5k+DZydqX0Ntw==","fsize":281523,"resto":122004269,"id":"CpLn\/FNn","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

That\u2019s not really a criticism, it\u2019s just a statement of fact. Integral elements of the genre, such as the nearly unlimited power and authority superheroes are handed with little to no oversight, are inherently authoritarian concepts. As such, superhero stories that wind up addressing or examining these themes tend to shake out in one of two directions: either they flee the implications for fear of undermining the whole genre (which is my theory why Marvel\u2019s first Civil War comic had to make the argument between pro and anti-registration so ridiculously one sided), or they just ignore the implications entirely.<\/span><br><br>\/pol only turns the bad guys in superhero movies into memes<br>But the heroes are very dark and fascist themselves these days, at least in the eyes of sjw","time":1491343663,"resto":119518239,"id":"mtyMnjDH","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":119524322,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)18:10:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119523819\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119523819<\/a><br>that is just stupid story bitching<br>It is much easier for the audience to identify with one person.

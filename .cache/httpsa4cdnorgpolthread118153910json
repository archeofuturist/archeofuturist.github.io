Used to be a normal guy, partied with friends, smoked weed, loved life. Now i left all that behind, trying to build a better life, and live by higher principals. Hopefully some better people will come into my life the more i move forward. It sucks how much degeneracy there is in this world. Part of me wants to go travel and run away, but there is no where to go, i need to keep working on my self and moving forward and keeping my eye on the prize. Remember anons if you want to change the world you have to change yourself first.","filename":"1487107881325","ext":".png","w":1280,"h":924,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":180,"tim":1490399692017,"time":1490399692,"md5":"pq3rfHHxG\/3MhpdLWhHrWg==","fsize":485233,"resto":0,"id":"HZtc\/1ri","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"i-just-realized-how-a-majority-of-people-are","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

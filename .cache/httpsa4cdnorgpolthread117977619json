The RBMK had no allowance or planning for core meltdowns, and the imminent interaction of the core mass with the bubbler pool would have produced a massive steam explosion, likely destroying the entire plant (vastly increasing the spread and magnitude of the radioactive plume). It was therefore necessary to drain the bubbler pool before the corium reached it. However, the initial explosion had broken the control circuitry which allowed the pool to be emptied. Three volunteer divers were required to manually operate the valves necessary to drain this pool, and later images of the corium mass in the pipes of the bubbler pool&#039;s basement reinforced the heroic necessity of their actions.[40][41][42]<\/span><br><br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Nucle<wbr>ar_meltdown#China_syndrome","time":1490304939,"resto":117977619,"id":"AnC69ElT","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":117987606,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)17:37:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"Should I spend 80 bucks on gas mask and filters?","time":1490305042,"resto":117977619,"id":"Ib\/MI5nr","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117987649,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)17:37:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117987173\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117987173<\/a><br>i hope not","filename":"1458017529294","ext":".png","w":750,"h":750,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490305062529,"time":1490305062,"md5":"GPFXgEzIO9AWm+lRhRfefQ==","fsize":66316,"resto":117977619,"id":"WYVVQMXT","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":117987663,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)17:37:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117987358\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117987358<\/a><br><br>Its molton as in lava and from what I understand it reacts somehow with concrete as in breaks it down chemically or something.

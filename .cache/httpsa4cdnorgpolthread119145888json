It\u2019s saying \u201chere\u2019s why this happens\u201d.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;From an economic point of view, you could imagine a world where rich people make $500,000, spend the first $50,000 on normal living expenses like everyone else, and then have $450,000 left over to buy yachts or whatever. In reality, according to a lot of different sources, most of them are more like these people; getting nice versions of things, but having surprisingly few savings and generally wondering where the money went at the end of the year.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Wealthy people are going to spend what they have, then feel, _subjectively_, like they don\u2019t have enough. Then they\u2019re going to feel like they need to be wealthier. And really, \u201cwealthy people feel a surprisingly strong need to be wealthier\u201d is a pretty important fact to know if you want to understand society. <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Also, if (absent any countervailing force) budgeting expands to fit the space available, that\u2019s an interesting principle that\u2019s useful to know no matter how wealthy you are.<\/span><br><br>Agree\/disagree?","filename":"tumblr_inline_onp5wmZjeZ1skdjyu_1280","ext":".png","w":584,"h":545,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":233,"tim":1491022102916,"time":1491022102,"md5":"EQXgWD4m6avXoglzCGqF1A==","fsize":218431,"resto":0,"id":"G25arR33","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"although-part-of-me-wants-to-not-make-fun-of-this","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

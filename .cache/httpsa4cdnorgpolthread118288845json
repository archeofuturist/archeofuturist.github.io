Look at a community purely economically as if you had no emotional ties to anything but your own gratification. You have the best chance to get succeed when you have the backing and trust of an entire community, the more homogeneous in culture the better.<br><br>How do you increase their fondness of you? You invest in the future, be as successful as possible, offer jobs and economic investment into the community so that their children will have a better head start than what they did.<br><br>How do you get them to trust and support you as a community on a more intimate level? Have children yourself and prove you are completely invested in them. The community has interest in whether your children are of good upbringing or not as it effects not only the population which will look after them in their twilight years, but also the colleagues, friends and partners of their own children. <br><br>So, it is within your interest to make the highest effort to find a trustworthy and wholesome wife suitable to raise your children in the best way possible. Doing this will act as insurance to your neighbours that they should trust you and help you when it is needed. All because they benefit from your success. If humans didn&#039;t benefit from each other&#039;s success we would be purely individualistic and nomadic, never congregating.","filename":"1456086043046","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":442,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":92,"tim":1490486388774,"time":1490486388,"md5":"sYxMEc\/EDGkIMwNj3wIpoA==","fsize":76590,"resto":118288845,"id":"PSPeSBZN","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118292614,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)20:02:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118288845\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118288845<\/a><br><a href=\"#p118292282\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118292282<\/a><br>2\/2<br>Then their is the argument to be made that the qualities of a woman&#039;s femininity complement those of a man.

In North America that is even more taboo. What I don&#039;t understand is why the left cannot be subverted to provide a political candidate who will dramatically reduce immigration (in NA or Europe) without conservative social policies that typically turn off women and younger voters. <br><br>Offer to legalize weed, give gays marriage, keep abortion etc. but reduce immigration. Has this been tried in any major way yet? You may love the moral purity of fascism and extreme social reactionary policies but they have failed to yield a single successful candidate in a major wealthy Western nation.<br><br>You can be disgusted personally with gays but realize (as I guess Milo likely does) that a White gay male running as a conservative has the best chance of winning any sort of nationalistic reforms in a democratic manner at this point. They tried having Cubans run as Republicans, and it did not work at all. I think gay nationalists vs. straight Silicon Valley technocrats are likely the future of American politics. <br><br>Pic Unrelated","filename":"girlscoutcookies","ext":".jpg","w":1200,"h":607,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":126,"tim":1493779848266,"time":1493779848,"md5":"jL9Y41jE0j1C6OKOJsLw6w==","fsize":108883,"resto":0,"id":"FqOrILDI","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"why-are-social-leftism-and-antiimmigration","country_name":"United States","replies":5,"images":0,"unique_ips":5},{"no":123861643,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)22:59:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123860759\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123860759<\/a><br>thin mints are the patrician choice","time":1493780362,"resto":123860759,"id":"WZjEb9GP","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123861646,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)22:59:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"Indoctrination, nigga. I get what you mean, abortion would literally lower the dumb black\/hispanic\/muslim\/redneck population and weed is harmless, though it was used to target said blacks\/hispanics. And nobody I know gives a fuck about gays, maybe some on the internet. Unfortunately part of left-wing indoctrination includes hating everything wrong this country has ever done since its inception, which includes conquering Mexico\/the West, slavery, not letting women vote, etc. etc.... If leftists can ever get over that the a lot of conservatives would lean towards them. I actually know more conservatives who are for weed, gays, and minorities than I do liberals who aren&#039;t anti-white and pro-responsibility.","time":1493780364,"resto":123860759,"id":"T7CGfEiJ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123861768,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)23:00:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123861646\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123861646<\/a><br>But like hating America&#039;s past decisions is not exactly a political platform.

They are arranged in a hierarchy as follows from top to bottom: Kings, warriors, burgoiuse, workers. This is important to recognize, in order to understand what involution means. In our so called modern society, we are caught in the middle of this process of involution. Involution is a shift of power from the higher caste, down to the lower castes. <br><br>Evola speaks of &quot;modern man&quot; as opposed to the man of Tradition. Allow me to interpret this. Today, man feels himself to be &quot;equal&quot;, towards other men that is. But the man of tradition, of times of old, did not share this feeling. Instead the man of old felt himself to belong to one of the four main societal castes. This feeling of modern man, to feel &quot;equal&quot;, is a sign of involution, it signals the shift of societal power from the highly qualified minority, to the masses.","filename":"1489784252189","ext":".jpg","w":479,"h":800,"tn_w":74,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491007413081,"time":1491007413,"md5":"pJGoP6gZwT7rC5MWc\/Ieng==","fsize":38957,"resto":119116500,"id":"ocvKixch","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":119122678,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)20:47:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119122328\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119122328<\/a><br>So in his view a man of tradition must maintain the order or just let circle end?<br>From what I got we&#039;re really in the middle of the long night.","time":1491007627,"resto":119116500,"id":"ivgAJyQq","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":119122689,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)20:47:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"I&#039;ve read a lot of his stuff, and to someone who feels like he doesn&#039;t belong into this world, he sounds very much like he&#039;s got a solution.<br><br>What impresses me personally is how much writing he did, and on how many subjects.

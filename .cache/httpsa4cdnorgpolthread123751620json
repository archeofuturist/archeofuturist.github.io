God how i hated those pride parades when growing up in lithuania during soviet times. Nowadays there are even more such pride parades under rule of CIA lemon party gestapo. They are encrypted under various self containing and self conflicting ideologies. Did you see the size of USA embassy in Riga? That place is huge. Must be lots of CIA homos and DIA cunts hiding and doing something in that place.","time":1493720598,"resto":123751620,"id":"wGWG0oHR","country":"LT","country_name":"Lithuania"}]}

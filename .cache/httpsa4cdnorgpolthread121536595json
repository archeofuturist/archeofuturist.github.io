You can do ANYTHING YOU WANT TO DO and you can be ANYTHING YOU WANT TO BE. They want us to think that the average person is powerless to positively change the world, but the TRUTH is that we have INFINITE POWER - both individually AND collectively. There&#039;s only one of us here. If you hit yourself on the head with a baseball bat, they&#039;ll put you in a mental hospital, yet that&#039;s EXACTLY what people are doing on a global scale. You can call Pure Consciousness &#039;God&#039; if you want, but I don&#039;t because the word &#039;God&#039; has religious connotations that I would rather avoid. Religion is the McDonald&#039;s of spirituality.<br><br>What we need to do is to raise our level of consciousness, both individually AND collectively. If even one person raises his or her level of consciousness, it has a ripple effect that benefits EVERYONE ELSE, even if they don&#039;t believe any of this stuff - and this is because &#039;reality&#039; itself is HOLOGRAPHIC in nature. One of the ways that they have manipulated us so deeply for so long is by suppressing our sense of the possible. What we call &#039;reality&#039; is COMPLETELY ILLUSORY and thus MALLEABLE - and they KNOW THIS, while most other people do NOT. EVERYTHING IS ILLUSORY, EXCEPT PURE CONSCIOUSNESS ITSELF. NOTHING is impossible in a universe that is ILLUSORY TO BEGIN WITH. People are AWAKENING to a MORE EXPANDED CONCEPTION of the world and life in general and this is a PROFOUNDLY GOOD THING. We owe it to our innate intelligence to QUESTION EVERYTHING and that includes EVERYTHING that I tell you. We have the power to transform this prison illusion into a PARADISE ILLUSION, so let&#039;s USE that power.","filename":"image","ext":".png","w":581,"h":552,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":118,"tim":1492445448019,"time":1492445448,"md5":"R\/z8uoO6vDm+FWOmJ0wqmA==","fsize":677458,"resto":121536595,"id":"5fB+XZcP","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":121542897,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)12:11:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121542610\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121542610<\/a><br>Thanks.

Our TRUE STATE, our TRUE NATURE and our TRUE IDENTITY is Pure Consciousness and Pure Consciousness is ALL-PERFECT AND EVER-PERFECT. We are SIMULTANEOUSLY one yet different in our oneness in much the same way that the waves of an ocean are one with that ocean but are also unique in and of themselves in that each wave has its own shape, speed and size. I think that&#039;s pretty neat. What we call &#039;reality&#039; is HOLOGRAPHIC in nature, so we are in fact smaller versions of the whole (which you can call &#039;God&#039;, if you want). Every part of the whole contains the whole and, to be more accurate, IS the whole. And just as a drop of water contains the same qualities as an entire ocean of water, we likewise contain all that exists within us - but merely on a smaller scale. From unconditional love we ALL sprang and to unconditional love we ALL return. There are no answers, only choices. There are no hallucinations, only shifts in perception. There are no laws, only habits. There are no coincidences, only synchronicities. There are no truths, only experiences. Heaven and Earth shall pass away, but my message shall NEVER pass away.

Since the beginning of Deng Xiaoping&#039;s reforms, China&#039;s GDP has risen tenfold.[28] The increase in total factor productivity (TFP) was the most important factor, with productivity accounting for 40.1% of the GDP increase, compared with a decline of 13.2% for the period 1957 to 1978\u2014the height of Maoist policies.

Per capita incomes grew at 6.6% a year.[29] Average wages rose sixfold between 1978 and 2005,[30] while absolute poverty declined from 41% of the population to 5% from 1978 to 2001.[31]<\/span><br><br>A decline from a whopping 41 PERCENT OF ABSOLUTE POVERTY to 5% under capitalism.<br><br>Your ideology is so fucking garbage.","filename":"1488586671712","ext":".png","w":644,"h":598,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":116,"tim":1490590192096,"time":1490590192,"md5":"SH3ikeDGIAFfnwhZXQ5Vug==","fsize":123029,"resto":118462192,"id":"wAJF0BYX","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118473171,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)00:50:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118463960\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118463960<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;appeal to authority fallacy<\/span><br><br>Did you even see the sticky, fag?","time":1490590210,"resto":118462192,"id":"e9c+JnMo","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118473173,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)00:50:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"Well, guess I&#039;ll let some other anons take it from here.

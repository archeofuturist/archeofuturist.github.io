Granted, she&#039;s doing well making dog collars, but it&#039;s not something you&#039;d expect someone with a background in electronics, circuit design, and physics. So, my point. Your degree rarely becomes your life&#039;s work. Be prepared to do whatever you have to, in life to succeed. Also, don&#039;t blame the system, if you can&#039;t do enough remedial math to figure out that 80K is too much to spend on a degree when you are making 7.50 an hour at Burger King. A degree is not a guarantee of employment. It&#039;s a piece of fucking paper.","time":1493694887,"resto":123706899,"id":"SOQQYEGo","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

is regressing to have the economic and political structure of a developing nation, an MIT economist has warned.<br><br>Peter Temin says the world&#039;s\u2019 largest economy has roads and bridges that look more like those in Thailand and Venezuela than those in parts of Europe.<br><br>The economist describes a two-track economy with on the one hand 20 per cent of the population that is educated and enjoys good jobs and supportive social networks.<br><br>On the other hand, the remaining 80 per cent, he said, are part of the US\u2019 low-wage sector, where the world of possibility has shrunk and people are burdened with debts and anxious about job security.","filename":"1493231960001","ext":".jpg","w":2048,"h":1365,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1493235588368,"time":1493235588,"md5":"OD2d2wZyJ+sA2Dj2sT0Ciw==","fsize":1745392,"resto":0,"id":"4c5zpuXA","country":"IL","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"usa-regressing-into-a-developing-nation","country_name":"Israel","replies":13,"images":1,"unique_ips":12},{"no":122927638,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)15:40:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a

For since they hold it for certain that men destitute of all religious sense are very rarely to be found, they seem to have founded on that belief a hope that the nations, although they differ among themselves in certain religious matters, will without much difficulty come to agree as brethren in professing certain doctrines, which form as it were a common basis of the spiritual life. For which reason conventions, meetings and addresses are frequently arranged by these persons, at which a large number of listeners are present, and at which all without distinction are invited to join in the discussion, both infidels of every kind, and Christians, even those who have unhappily fallen away from Christ or who with obstinacy and pertinacity deny His divine nature and mission. Certainly such attempts can nowise be approved by Catholics, founded as they are on that false opinion which considers all religions to be more or less good and praiseworthy, since they all in different ways manifest and signify that sense which is inborn in us all, and by which we are led to God and to the obedient acknowledgment of His rule. Not only are those who hold this opinion in error and deceived, but also in distorting the idea of true religion they reject it, and little by little. turn aside to naturalism and atheism, as it is called; from which it clearly follows that one who supports those who hold these theories and attempt to realize them, is ALTOGETHER ABANDONING THE DIVINELY REVEALED RELIGION.","time":1492707539,"resto":122002821,"id":"gKtf3Uvc","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122014227,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)13:01:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122002821\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122002821<\/a><br><br>Let&#039;s see.<br><br>He said atheists do not have to believe in God to go to heaven.<br><br>He said he cannot judge whether or not homosexuality is a sin.<br><br>He said that Jesus literally turned himself into the serpent, that Jesus literally turned himself into the devil, on the cross.<br><br>Anyone who knows the Holy Spirit knows that He has nothing whatsoever to do with the Catholic church.","time":1492707672,"resto":122002821,"id":"ndNCmsVh","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122014387,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)13:02:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122002821\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122002821<\/a><br><br>Oh, and because none of you Catholics do any digging into your own foul organization&#039;s history, you might want to know how intimately involved he was in the murder of thousands of people during a junta in Argentina.","time":1492707764,"resto":122002821,"id":"ndNCmsVh","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122014603,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)13:04:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122014227\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122014227<\/a><br>Granted, the media spun some of that.

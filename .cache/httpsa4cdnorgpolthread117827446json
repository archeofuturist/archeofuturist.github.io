Nearly 11 million gallons of oil spewed into the ocean over the course of three days. Even today, there are still some places in Prince William Sound where you can find oil that is as toxic as it was 28 years ago.<br><br>But, I\u2019m optimistic that we can learn from the mistakes of the past and work together to make sure another Exxon Valdez doesn\u2019t occur off the coast of Alaska. We saw first-hand what happens when we don\u2019t take preparedness seriously.<br><br>Now, nearly three decades after the Exxon Valdez oil spill in Prince William Sound, the Arctic Ocean is facing threats from increasing vessel traffic in the Bering Strait.<br><br>As Arctic sea ice continues to melt, the Bering Sea\u2014including the narrow Bering Strait\u2014is experiencing more and more ship traffic. As ship traffic increases, so do the risks, including oil spills, vessel strikes on marine mammals, air pollution, discharge of waste into the water and production of underwater noise.<br><br>Take action today by asking the U.S. Coast Guard to take steps to reduce the risks of increasing vessel traffic in the Bering Sea. We can\u2019t wait\u2014we need to put in place key measures to increase safety and reduce risk in the Arctic waters.<br><br>The Bering Sea is used by millions of seabirds and an array of marine mammals including whales, seals, walruses and polar bears. Alaska Native communities rely on these resources for food security and cultural practices that date back millennia.<br><br>There\u2019s no doubt that the Arctic Ocean is unique and important\u2014there is a lot at stake if we don\u2019t work together to do all we can to protect of this region.","filename":"arctic-exxon-seal_natgeo-1066","ext":".jpg","w":1066,"h":707,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":165,"tim":1490217322949,"time":1490217322,"md5":"UQFb\/cKR2AeubZribKwoag==","fsize":351180,"resto":0,"id":"fS2gJMVG","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"this-is-one-anniversary-that-i-dont-like","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":1,"unique_ips":2},{"no":117827863,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)17:17:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117827446\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117827446<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;28 years ago<\/span><br>lol who gives a shit?","filename":"no_waifu_no_laifu_by_imtheonenexttome-d7nsx3b","ext":".gif","w":500,"h":500,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490217470920,"time":1490217470,"md5":"BPqy2kxshq8NiNgdYZItHg==","fsize":970119,"resto":117827446,"id":"Y5yjJZlu","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]}

Four are ancient: &quot;Brahmin,&quot; &quot;Jewish,&quot; &quot;Chinese,&quot; and &quot;Turanian&quot;. Three are medieval: &quot;Latin,&quot; &quot;Byzantine,&quot; and &quot;Arab.&quot; The differences between civilizations are based on their attitude to law and ethics.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;For example, Koneczny claimed that in Latin civilization, ethics is the source of law. If some laws are not ethical, then they are changed. Religion is autonomous, independent and separated from the state. Individuality, self-rule and decentralization are highly valued. Government is judged on the basis of its adherence to ethics. The law is of dual nature, divided into public and private spheres.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In Turanian civilization, the government is the source of law and ethics and stands above the law and ethics. The ruler cannot be doubted.

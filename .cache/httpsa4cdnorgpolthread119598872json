Him and Orb\u00e1n became close friends. <br><br>When the Fidesz lost the elections in 1994, Orb\u00e1n decided that the Fidesz must not be without its own media outlets and its own background. They need their own entrepreneurs who will finance the party so that the Fidesz would not depend on others and would not have to make compromises. Enter Simicska, he meticulously built up an economic background for the party.","filename":"simicska","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":852,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1491401013162,"time":1491401013,"md5":"VMg2dm09QWd\/hhSCGCotmw==","fsize":103491,"resto":119598872,"id":"mnDYBUsh","country":"HU","m_img":1,"country_name":"Hungary"},{"no":119609142,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)10:04:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119608974\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119608974<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;sicred service<\/span><br>secret*, lol, sry","time":1491401097,"resto":119598872,"id":"mElAaFR9","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":119609300,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)10:06:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119609018\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119609018<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Importing Ukrainians is still better than Muslims<\/span><br>Not for us, watch this movie, and you will understand why:<br>http:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt6068960<wbr>\/","time":1491401201,"resto":119598872,"id":"mElAaFR9","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":119609596,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)10:09:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"In 1998, the Fidesz won the elections and Orb\u00e1n became PM for the first time. Simicska was nominated as the head of the APEH (Hungary&#039;s IRS). Under his tenure, the APEH operated with improved efficiency, but was also used as an attack dog against Orb\u00e1n&#039;s political enemies. Tax audits are powerful weapons. Simicska was under constant attacks from the opposition and resigned in the end of 1999, officially because his father and his father-in-law died because of stress. Reportedly, his last words to the press were &quot;you killed my father and my father-in-law, may God have mercy on you!&quot; <br><br>After that, he retired from publicity and organized the Fidesz&#039;s entrepreneural background from behind the scenes. <br><br>When the Fidesz lost the elections in 2002, they had a considerable economical background behind them.

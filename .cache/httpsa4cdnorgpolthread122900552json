Bernie Sanders, has come out in defense of Ann Coulter, denouncing threats that forced the University of California, Berkeley, to try to postpone her appearanceat the college.<br><br>\u201cI don\u2019t like this. I don\u2019t like it,\u201d Sanders told The Huffington Post in response tothe security threats that forced the university to put offthe conservative firebrand\u2019s event.<br><br>\u201cObviously Ann Coulter\u2019s outrageous\u2015to my mind, off the wall. But you know, people have a right to give their two cents-worth, give a speech, without fear of violence and intimidation,\u201d he added.<br><br>The senator from Vermont also slammed protesters who saidCoulter shouldn\u2019t be given a platform to speak at the university, calling them \u201ca sign of intellectual weakness.\u201d<br><br>\u201cIf you can\u2019t ask Ann Coulter in a polite way questions which expose the weakness of her arguments, if all you can do is boo, or shut her down, or prevent her from coming, what does that tell the world?\u201d hesaid.<br><br>Coulter was originally scheduled to appear at UC Berkeley on April 27, but the university canceled the eventafterlocal police said theyhad \u201cvery specific intelligence regarding threats that could pose a grave danger to the speaker, attendees and those who may wish to lawfully protest the event.\u201d<br><br>The university later reversed the decision to cancel the event and instead offered to holdthe event on May 2, an offer Coulter has ruled out, tweeting:\u201cI\u2019m speaking at Berkeley on April 27th, as I was invited to do and have a contract to do.\u201d<br><br>https:\/\/heatst.com\/culture-wars\/ber<wbr>nie-sanders-defends-ann-coulter-sla<wbr>ms-intellectually-weak-student-acti<wbr>vists\/","filename":"bernie-coulter-e1492905876809","ext":".png","w":1320,"h":650,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":123,"tim":1493223091424,"time":1493223091,"md5":"NDlosvraQLfnc7DPpvivSw==","fsize":900014,"resto":0,"id":"pW0wyXnk","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"bernie-sanders-defends-ann-coulter-slams","country_name":"United

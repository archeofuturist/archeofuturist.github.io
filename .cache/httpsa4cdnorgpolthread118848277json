Political correctness started to get used by old media to attack new media because there has been overwhelming consensus that it was code of conduct.<br>So old media weaponized it against new media, why do you think video games were attacked so vehemently on violence years ago?<br>Why did feminism get pushed so hard?<br>Why is it always the newspapers and tv, media which have been losing money for years that double down on it and intensify the usage of it all the time?<br>These attacks all had in common that they were against new media because for example video gamers don&#039;t watch tv too much and this hurts the old media. So they conjure up some bullshit to discredit it.<br>((((they)))) didn&#039;t necessarily want to impose cultural marxism or anything. ((((They)))), in the first place, wanted shekels all along!

We ought to push the fact that he was in Hollande&#039;s government. The PS are very unpopular now so any association with them should be exploited. Also spread his involvement with the banks, and link that to the financial crisis. This could help win over some of JLM&#039;s base. Attracting most of Fillon&#039;s support is also a task - this can be done mostly by, again, pushing Macron&#039;s involvement in Hollande&#039;s government. Also see if we can imply that Macron is a submissive gay (he probably is). I saw a good thread on this a while back. The French like their politicians to be alpha. To be seen as a submissive is a death sentence. Likewise in this vein, we should push the image of Le Pen being a strong leader, a Joan of Arc-type character (but don&#039;t go too strong with this).<br>All memes must be in French. I hope the French here can be put in the effort since we&#039;re going to need their help. The French are very particular about their language and any foreign influence will be detected.<br>Napoleon said &quot;toujours l&#039;attaque&quot; (always attack). And he is right. We cannot allow people to focus on the FN too much, or they&#039;ll get scared by muh evil nazis meme.

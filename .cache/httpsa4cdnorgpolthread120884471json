It is estimated that Hamas, Hezbollah, Islamic Jihad and Syria now have about a quarter of a million rockets and missiles between them. In the most extreme scenario, with Iran joining the melee, the number of missiles increases considerably.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The most ominous threat now facing Israel is the possibility of a surprise rocket and missile attack in which all of its enemies \u2014 Hezbollah, Hamas, Islamic Jihad, Syria and Iran \u2014 fire tens of thousands of rockets and missiles at Israel in a single day, in a coordinated attack. Israel compares such a scenario to the &quot;1973 Yom Kippur surprise,&quot; in which Egypt and Syria attacked Israel simultaneously. As of now, Israel has no response to such an attack.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The assessment is that, in such a scenario, the Israeli air force will successfully destroy thousands of long-range missiles and launchers, mainly those belonging to Hamas and Hezbollah. Similarly, Israel&#039;s missile defense systems will intercept many more missiles. Nevertheless, the Israeli Home Front will still suffer hits from thousands more rockets and missiles, the most accurate of which could reach Israeli air force bases, impeding the air force&#039;s capacity to respond. One senior Israeli military official told Al-Monitor on condition of anonymity that &quot;the only response to such a threat is deterrence. Our enemies know exactly what price they will pay for initiating such a move, and it will be much higher \u2014 incomparably higher \u2014 than the price paid by Israel.&quot;<\/span><br><br>http:\/\/www.al-monitor.com\/pulse\/ori<wbr>ginals\/2017\/04\/israel-syria-hezboll<wbr>ah-hamas-islamic-jihad-iran-missile<wbr>s.html","time":1492071651,"resto":120884471,"id":"Rl+mkmsk","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120887049,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)04:24:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120886650\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120886650<\/a><br>Same thing doesn&#039;t apply to your qt grills, apparently.

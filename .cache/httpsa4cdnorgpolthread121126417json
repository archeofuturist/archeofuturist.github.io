Pyongyang is much like a regular Chinese\/Russian city, except with little electricity\/heating and a limited number of resources. The average city worker won&#039;t have a car and will have to rely on the metro system and busses. They will most likely be able to get enough food to just about support themselves. The higher skilled\/higher class workers can get access to a bike or even a car and probably get some luxury goods like a mobile phone, maybe a microwave and certain foods. They&#039;ll also be able to go to these places which they show in the propoganda videos which tourists take like the pizza place, the technology shop and the foreign goods shop. The average worker probably has the ability to get cheap street food occasionally but most of the time will have to stick with whatever they can get from the grocery store, which will mainly be rice.<br><br>The other cities such as Nampo are probably similar to small African cities. A proportion of people will be able to get rice, maybe beans and other vegetables too. Bikes and some cars exist, but the majority of people will live in slums and be malnourished. The rural areas are where there really is a huge crisis. Farmers in rural areas have to farm mostly rice to feed the population but they have no electricity, no heating, limited access to water. All they have to eat is rice. They&#039;re living like in medival times.

There is no grass and no trees in this country except on the mountains, which are unclimbable or have extra-wide paved roads all the way to the top for the throngs of old people equipped with skipoles and rockclimbing gear to walk on a sidewalk every weekend because they pretend they enjoy it.

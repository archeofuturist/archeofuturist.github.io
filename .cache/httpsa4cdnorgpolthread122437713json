What was originally a rapidly growing forum dedicated to comedy became a liberal hellhole over the course of a few years. I recall in 2008 (before I could even buy and account) seeing a thread about &#039;white privilege&#039;, with multiple people arguing against the concept with no problems. In 2012, only 4 years later, it became a complete pozhole filled with SJWs and nu-male beta cucks. The gay\/tranny megathreads in E\/N were gathering a large following of the weak faggots that flocked to SA in the mid-late 2000&#039;s. Now its a mostly hollowed out shell, the &quot;GBS 2.0&quot; experiment basically failed due to whiny trannies, and Lowtax is probably running out of ambien fast.<br><br>My question is, how did it all happen? I&#039;ve seen some posts here and there about the offsite LF forum and no life marxists conspiring to acquire moderator positions so that they could muscle out wrongthink. Was SA a sign of what the internet could become soon?

What was originally a rapidly growing forum dedicated to comedy became a liberal hellhole over the course of a few years. I recall in 2008 (before I could even buy and account) seeing a thread about &#039;white privilege&#039;, with multiple people arguing against the concept with no problems. In 2012, only 4 years later, it became a complete pozhole filled with SJWs and nu-male beta cucks. The gay\/tranny megathreads in E\/N were gathering a large following of the weak faggots that flocked to SA in the mid-late 2000&#039;s. Now its a mostly hollowed out shell, the &quot;GBS 2.0&quot; experiment basically failed due to whiny trannies, and Lowtax is probably running out of ambien fast.<br><br>My question is, how did it all happen? I&#039;ve seen some posts here and there about the offsite LF forum and no life marxists conspiring to acquire moderator positions so that they could muscle out wrongthink. Was SA a sign of what the internet could become soon? Can we stop it?","filename":"hqdefault (1)","ext":".jpg","w":480,"h":360,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1492961850366,"time":1492961850,"md5":"zXhhw3Z9B+VofsnQtPPkPg==","fsize":8405,"resto":0,"id":"FF68WfX\/","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"how-could-one-website-fall-to-liberals-so-hard","country_name":"United States","replies":6,"images":0,"unique_ips":7},{"no":122438457,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)11:44:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"No, check Wiki edit logs.

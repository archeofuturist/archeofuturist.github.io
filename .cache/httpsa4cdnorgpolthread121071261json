Their victims, who they arrest, beat and torture, are at their mercy. They are protected by many things: by the tinpot tyrants who rule a republic violently subjugated by Vladimir Putin; by the den of reactionary views that is the Moscow regime; and by the acquiescence \u2013 support even \u2013 of a society soaked in homophobic hatred.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Their consciences will not trouble them. It is always comforting to imagine that those who commit atrocities against fellow human beings are sociopaths or evil. But that does not explain the great horrors of human history, from fascism to colonialism. Inhumanity is only made possible by stripping a group of its humanity. You only feel empathy, after all, for those you feel are human beings like you. That\u2019s how human beings who in other contexts feel compassion and love and warmth can become capable of the most unspeakable horrors.<\/span><br>Chechens tell of prison beatings and electric shocks in anti-gay purge: \u2018They called us animals\u2019<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;But however strong Chechnya\u2019s oppressors currently feel, history will damn them and unequivocally side with those they torment. That is of little comfort to those being beaten and tortured right now. The loneliness many of them feel will be total. Hated by the authorities, their families, their friends, all hope will feel vanquished.<\/span>","filename":"IMG_1766","ext":".jpg","w":1400,"h":788,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1492183407742,"time":1492183407,"md5":"6rS2FWyVUHRpUuKQFpg\/uQ==","fsize":160202,"resto":121071261,"id":"upNir5B8","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":121072558,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)11:27:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Egypt\u2019s police entrap gay men using dating apps. In every country on Earth, being gay still means being treated, to some degree, as inferior: whether because of social penalties or because of legal persecution.

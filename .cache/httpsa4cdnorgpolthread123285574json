But if you want a completely secular theory here is my best attempt.<br><br>Society is a hyper complex system of interactions among people. These interactions are guided by societal &#039;rule&#039; or norms of behavior. These norms can change over time based on internal or external sources. But are reinforced to stay as is by the concept of tradition. Tradition while there is an emotional component to it, is essentially based on the principle of, &quot;If it ain&#039;t broke don&#039;t fix it.&quot; <br><br>Different cultures have different norms of behavior. Those with the most advantageous norms had the most stable and prosperous societies. Those with middling societal norms didn&#039;t do as well, and those with awful norms died out. Eventually the norms which were the most successful displaced with even middling norms. The highly successful norms of societies are nuclear family, rule of law, private property, justice system to prevent murder, usurpation and other crime.<br><br>Because these norms became so pervasive through the iterative process of societal growth, they became associated with &#039;traditional&#039; values. Traditional values are traditional because they work. They allowed generation after generation of those societies to flourish, prosper, and most importantly produce another generation that would do the same.","filename":"two genders","ext":".jpg","w":480,"h":360,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1493435250636,"time":1493435250,"md5":"UX8uh1R8L0Asa2Fb+DL+fw==","fsize":24367,"resto":123285574,"id":"tnTx0aBC","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

Latest episode I saw it gets infiltrated, and from what I can tell, it&#039;s basically CTR on steroids. I&#039;m waiting for the next episode to see where it goes, but they were just talking about &quot;sock puppet accounts&quot; and instructing this massive room full of people to &quot;get out there (on the web) and get angry!&quot;<br><br>This is going to sound weird and maybe even paranoid, but I think they&#039;re going to try and push the idea that basically it is us, \/pol\/, alt-right, nationalists, trump voters, whatever you want to identify our awoovement as, that are the government shills. That some shady organisation is faking the whole thing online for some gain. Maybe even a parallel to suggest that it was some kind of Republican plot to get Trump into power.<br><br>Is anyone else aware of this?","filename":"64b22293da20e8c6f9d585f76e7eaf01","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":500,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490757588086,"time":1490757588,"md5":"cHJpyxPzoApluOMP+7C1JQ==","fsize":41534,"resto":0,"id":"\/dlWA1Bi","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"homelands-scary-narrative","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":8,"images":1,"unique_ips":6},{"no":118740369,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)23:23:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"at this rate Season 7 will be on Chaturbate","time":1490757822,"resto":118739976,"id":"\/xO1NkeH","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118740889,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)23:29:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118740369\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118740369<\/a><br>If this is true though, don&#039;t you think it&#039;s kinda scary?","time":1490758146,"resto":118739976,"id":"\/dlWA1Bi","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118740943,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)23:29:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118739976\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118739976<\/a><br>It&#039;s funny because the reality is the opposite.

The posture between the two really set the tone for our subsequent meetings between our high-level delegations. And I would tell you the exchanges were very frank.

I would just like to reiterate that we had a very productive two days with our counterparts. And specifically we had a meeting this morning that was a breakout of the first comprehensive economic dialogue. We had very direct and frank conversations about how we would work together. Secretary Ross and I will be leading that jointly, and we will be focused on trade, investment, and other economic opportunities between both companies -- countries.<br><br>We focused specifically on a more balanced economic relationship, specifically on trade. And we focused on the desire to have very specific action items both in the short term for the next time we get together, as well as what the goals are over the year. So I think we think the restructuring of the dialogue and having specifically a breakout that will address comprehensive economic opportunities across our different agencies both here and within China I think we felt was very productive, very good start in how we&#039;re going to structure it, and again, very specific things that we talked about to look forward on making progress in the short term on.<br><br>Secretary Ross?<br><br>SECRETARY ROSS: Thank you, Steven. I think in many ways, the most significant thing was a 100-day plan. Normally, trade discussions, especially between China and ourselves, are denominated in multiple years. This was denominated in the first instance in 100 days with hopefully way stations of accomplishment along the way. Given the range of issues and the magnitude, that may be ambitious, but it&#039;s a very big sea change in the pace of discussions. And I think that&#039;s a very very important symbolization of the growing rapport between the two countries.<br><br>(3\/?)","filename":"1491519372310","ext":".jpg","w":1620,"h":1080,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1491666022402,"time":1491666022,"md5":"LYqLzfJKVWw3dnsbg30ChA==","fsize":354561,"resto":120143387,"id":"kNsQHQHH","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United

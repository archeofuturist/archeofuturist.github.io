First postmarks originating from various rural areas in EU nations and picked up from drop boxes.<br><br>Destinations were dead end addresses that never existed.<br><br>Conclusion was that these were diversionary parcels in order to mask the movement of something else likely a dirty bomb or possibly even something non-radioactive.<br><br>After submitting the initial assessment I continued to my secondary objectives doing misc surveillance and questioning.<br><br>within 3 hours I was contacted by my operations director and told my assessment was an over-reaction and told to return home even though I was schedules for two more days.<br><br>It typically takes them a month to assess field reports and get back with the operative.<br><br>Something is going to happen.

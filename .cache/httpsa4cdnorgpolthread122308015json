The numbers:<br><br>Le Pen - 25%<br>Melenchon - 21.7%<br>Macron - 21.0%<br>Fillon - 20.2%<br>Hamon - 5.2%<br><br>Shut up an trust me on that. I will be right. Le Pen historically always overperforms her polls unless there is another credible right wing candidate for her votes to go to. There isn&#039;t. I have used a variety of other methods to calculate the other numbers; to be very brief, always remember that Macron&#039;s base is FRAGILE (1\/3 of voters could change minds) and is attracted to Melenchon&#039;s base, where as Fillon has stalled because of Penelopegate, and there is no reason to vote for Hamon as Melenchon becomes the candidate for the Left. <br><br>2nd Round will be 51.43% for Le Pen and 48.51% for Melenchon. Polls after the first round will show roughly a 54\/46 race, favouring Melenchon. <br><br>The crucial moment will come when Fillon ENDORSES Le Pen (or several prominent members of his party). Why would he\/they do that, you ask? Because they support Le Pen AGAINST the commie Melenchon (he wants 100% tax on rich). ALSO, they will have a parliamentary majority, and want to get shit done. THEY CAN GET SHIT DONE WITH LE PEN, BUT NOT WITH MELENCHON. This is crucial to remember.<br><br>This will be the FINAL BLOW. Currently (((polls))) predict the abstention rates of Fillon supporters in a 2nd round Le Pen\/Melenchon to be approximately 50%. (i.e. 50% do not vote at all). Fillon\/his party&#039;s endorsement of Le Pen will reduce this rate to approximately 30%, which results in the 51.43% victory I described above. So, add all these factors in and Le Pen will Make France Great Again. I&#039;m waiting, \/pol\/. Shortly, you will see that I was right.","filename":"ladda ned (2)","ext":".jpg","w":294,"h":171,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":145,"tim":1492885291384,"time":1492885291,"md5":"zDIdk6Nl4am5pfHE2hZbqw==","fsize":14503,"resto":0,"id":"0BqyOv2e","country":"SE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"le-pen-general-lpg-pepe-edition","country_name":"Sweden","replies":4,"images":1,"unique_ips":5},{"no":122308280,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)14:23:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122308015\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122308015<\/a><br>So...a Woodrow Wilson type victory, with two similar sides vying for the same position?<br><br>Can see it","time":1492885431,"resto":122308015,"id":"Iahgmr0n","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122309138,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)14:31:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122308015\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122308015<\/a><br>Common on yall le pen will win<br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=hj7<wbr>0rtP3lUQ","filename":"eJwNyFEKwyAMANC7eABjop3a24i1Vmgb0QwGY3df3-f7qvc41aoOkT5XgK3NzGPTU3ikWnRlrmdJvU2d-YIkkvJxlVsmULRmIWOdR_IWX0uAJ9B5Z6LDQCGiJ9hH-TTR_a7q9wfhQCJV","ext":".png","w":390,"h":391,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492885876147,"time":1492885876,"md5":"fj0zF6IBxsNq62zSp+RLog==","fsize":247858,"resto":122308015,"id":"pgDtiRkk","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122310131,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)14:39:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"Le Pen will lose in the second round (like lepens always did) to Macron who will get to the second with her.<br><br>She might win with Melenchon in the second tho, but I don&#039;t see him getting there.","time":1492886367,"resto":122308015,"id":"8rd+BjJe","country":"CZ","country_name":"Czech Republic"},{"no":122310453,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)14:42:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"Go le pen!","time":1492886525,"resto":122308015,"id":"hh7E6hga","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"}]}

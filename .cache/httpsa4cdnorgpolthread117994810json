The FA is now liaising with the UK Football Policing Unit about going through the video footage to see if it is possible to identify any member of the England Supporters Travel Club who might have been involved with a view to potentially banning them.<br><br>\u201cThe behaviour of a section of the support in Dortmund was inappropriate, disrespectful and disappointing,\u201d Clarke said. \u201cThe FA has consistently urged supporters to show respect and not to chant songs that could be regarded as insulting to others. Individuals who engage in such behaviour do not represent the overwhelming majority of England fans nor the values and identity we should aspire to as a football nation.","filename":"Screen Shot 2017-03-23 at 11.24.30 PM","ext":".png","w":1164,"h":988,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":212,"tim":1490308170895,"time":1490308170,"md5":"rvmB8k\/UEMdNY8SPvZuzgg==","fsize":1610525,"resto":0,"id":"aLxQNUOr","country":"DE","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"fa-urges-supporters-to-show-respect-and-not-to","country_name":"Germany","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

The FA is now liaising with the UK Football Policing Unit about going through the video footage to see if it is possible to identify any member of the England Supporters Travel Club who might have been involved with a view to potentially banning them.<br><br>\u201cThe behaviour of a section of the support in Dortmund was inappropriate, disrespectful and disappointing,\u201d Clarke said. \u201cThe FA has consistently urged supporters to show respect and not to chant songs that could be regarded as insulting to others. Individuals who engage in such behaviour do not represent the overwhelming majority of England fans nor the values and identity we should aspire to as a football nation.","filename":"Screen Shot 2017-03-23 at 11.24.30 PM","ext":".png","w":1164,"h":988,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":212,"tim":1490308170895,"time":1490308170,"md5":"rvmB8k\/UEMdNY8SPvZuzgg==","fsize":1610525,"resto":0,"id":"aLxQNUOr","country":"DE","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"fa-urges-supporters-to-show-respect-and-not-to","country_name":"Germany","replies":14,"images":2,"unique_ips":14},{"no":117996569,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)18:41:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117994810\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117994810<\/a><br>Lel, Krauts Triggered.<br><br>Stay based football fans.","time":1490308897,"resto":117994810,"id":"131l3TGY","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":117996772,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)18:43:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117996569\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117996569<\/a><br>Football fans are the last implicit sign of white masculinity in Europe.","time":1490308984,"resto":117994810,"id":"b5F7+12q","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117998179,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)18:53:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"That&#039;s legit nothing, the shit I&#039;ve seen and heard at some Tottenham Hotspur games and a few French games is actually insane.","time":1490309607,"resto":117994810,"id":"ZqNIUugb","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117998394,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)18:54:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117994810\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117994810<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Individuals who engage in such behavior do not represent the overwhelming majority of England fans<\/span>","filename":"1442990763291","ext":".gif","w":700,"h":400,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":71,"tim":1490309698377,"time":1490309698,"md5":"JL3qYBgJ\/hXc9mSXnjlT9g==","fsize":299046,"resto":117994810,"id":"FGrUmH1E","country":"KR","country_name":"South Korea"},{"no":117998570,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)18:56:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117994810\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117994810<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;booing the German national anthem<\/span>","filename":"22690f7965535d0795059aaf1dcb5864fe770ccfa07880a3dcbd64d55b24ae7c","ext":".jpg","w":625,"h":455,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":91,"tim":1490309771226,"time":1490309771,"md5":"QzpRSU93HKTdPJcGZ8I\/yA==","fsize":70889,"resto":117994810,"id":"9xGmhkMi","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":117998797,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)18:57:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117994810\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117994810<\/a><br>Fucking based","time":1490309865,"resto":117994810,"id":"ZYEZmqsK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117998982,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)18:59:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117994810\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117994810<\/a><br>THERE WERE 10 GERMAN BOMBERS IN THE AIR","time":1490309946,"resto":117994810,"id":"fJxsQJyB","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117999358,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)19:01:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117994810\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117994810<\/a><br>thats just funny though, why are the people with no sense of humour and the ones who were bullied in school in charge of everything now?","time":1490310099,"resto":117994810,"id":"2Rm2c3Mh","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":117999805,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)19:04:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"It does reflect the feeling of most Brittish fans.","time":1490310277,"resto":117994810,"id":"3rblErCU","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118000026,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)19:06:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117994810\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117994810<\/a><br>sour krauts cant banter","time":1490310363,"resto":117994810,"id":"KZ6VCfCd","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118000765,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)19:10:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117998982\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117998982<\/a><br>THERE WERE 10 GERMAN BOMBERS IN THE AIR","time":1490310653,"resto":117994810,"id":"P2v0Ey6u","country":"RO","country_name":"Romania"},{"no":118000930,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)19:11:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117999358\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117999358<\/a><br>Pretty sure even the football association doesn&#039;t really give a shit.<br>German fans don&#039;t care.<br>British fans don&#039;t care.<br>People who don&#039;t care about football certainly don&#039;t care.<br>The organizations don&#039;t care.<br><br>The only people who act like they care are shitty journalists who try to drum up controversy for clicks.

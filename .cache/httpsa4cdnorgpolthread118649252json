Try to define something without comparing it to anything else, be it form or concept. It can&#039;t be done. You can&#039;t understand anything the way it is by itself. You can&#039;t understand light without darkness, future without past, heat without cold, something without nothing.<br>God is the alpha and the omega. The one thing that has no opposite, whole and complete within itself. It is beyond duality, which is absolutely incomprehensible to the mind.<br><br>Who are you? You can point to your name, your family, your circumstances, your past, your hopes and dreams, anything you can think of. The problem is that all these things are merely mental labels, sounds without intrinsic meaning. You can say &quot;I am this,&quot; or &quot;I am that.&quot; However, &quot;this&quot; and &quot;that&quot; are ultimately meaningless expressions. Try to define them by themselves, in their own isolated reality. Can you do it? They point towards the truth like signposts, but they do not and cannot contain within them the full knowledge of that towards which they point. What does this mean? That nothing is ultimately knowable?<br><br>From the limited perspective of the mind, this is indeed the case. But this doesn&#039;t mean that you can&#039;t know yourself, or God. It simply means that God and your own true nature lie beyond the mind. The goal of Yoga, or meditation, is to attain this state of no mind. When the mind is subdued and all that remains is the silent, witnessing presence within you that is known as consciousness, you become aware or your own nature as inseparable from the rest of creation, and the eternally infinite light of God floods your very being. You realize that you ARE this being. This state of consciousness is called Samadhi in ancient Hinduism, or Dhyana\/Jhana in Buddhism.<br>&quot;I am that I am&quot; says God in Exodus 3:14. God is no thing. You can&#039;t narrow down God to a set of labels and relations. The same is true of you, because you ARE God.

Only 10% of annual immigration to the US come from Europe. Any proposal to even change that would be political suicide. The only political solutions are political infeasible. If you&#039;re white, just have a large family, raise them right, build your white communities, and prepare for the coming conflict. You and I will both be middle aged or old men by the time that large scale violence happens. It&#039;s the duty of the current generation and the next to lay the ground work, both ideologically and quite literally physically, for what will come. Personally I think the balkanization of the US roughly along ethnic\/racial lines will be the end result but who knows. The US won&#039;t exist in any way we&#039;d recognize by the end of this century though. The only good thing is that non-whites are concentrated in cities and a few states, the bad side of that is that Obama and his administration spent eight years laying the ground work for moving non-whites, especially blacks and hispanics, into white states and even more so into white counties by &quot;deurbanizing&quot; subsidized housing and changing where &quot;refugee&quot; populations go. The latter mostly being moved to small white cities with populations between 10-50k.","filename":"non hispanic white","ext":".png","w":2000,"h":1260,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":78,"tim":1492451046428,"time":1492451046,"md5":"8BDPWoUbE\/iNGVr1PdQEGA==","fsize":249137,"resto":121538836,"id":"3813hEDh","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121554439,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)13:46:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121552488\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121552488<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121554123\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121554123<\/a><br>And to add to this there isn&#039;t a single signifigant non-white minority group that votes majority Republican.

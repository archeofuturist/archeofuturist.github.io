Trump has been gathering and reviewing all intel as it came in. America has assets in syria, boots on the ground, drones, satellites etc. I strongly believe that Pres. Trump would not have made this immediate retaliatory strike if he were not 99% certain of its origin.

Perhaps Assad thought that Trump wouldn&#039;t act so early in his presidency, or perhaps Mr. Assad thought the &quot;allowed chemical attacks&quot; counter was reset to zero after Obama left, I&#039;m not sure.<br><br>But i am sick of Putin shills like you, you deny atrocity when these bodies are probably not in the ground. What Trump has done was what any strong leader would do. He is still against military intervention, he has stood up to the Neocons, but has shown that if you cross his red lines he will use a proportional response because he isnt a cuck like Obama. I can&#039;t fault Obama too much, he tried the diplomatic approach, got the UN to remove the weapons that Syria claimed they didn&#039;t even have (sound familiar?)<br><br>Pres. Trump ended this narrative that he is a puppet to Putin and everyone (whether lefty or kremlin shill) must take him seriously. Shills lost their mind because they were assuming Trump would be sucking Putin&#039;s cock this whole term, that Trump would just ignore his own intellegentsia saying Assad did this flagrant attack against all of humanity.<br><br>Gentleman, this quick and proportional response in recent events has strengthened my belief that history books will write Donald J. Trump was the best POTUS and the best statesman in 21th centrury. I am really proud of that i actively supported such a man.","time":1491571778,"resto":119941309,"id":"PB3SN7EJ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119947177,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)09:34:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119946533\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119946533<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Trump has been gathering and reviewing all intel as it came in.

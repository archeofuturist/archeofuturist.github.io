Then there is the prospect of a terrorist attack using a nuke, perhaps a \u2018dirty bomb\u2019.We must also recall that most false flag attacks, including 9-11, were drills that went live \u2013 they were pre-planned as a fake event designed to test emergency response but ended up being real events. This fact raises the disturbing notion that a nuclear event is being planned for NYC; and doubtless, it would be blamed on someone other than the perpetrators. The finger of blame might be pointed at ISIS in order to justify a US return to war in the Middle East, or perhaps it would point at North Korea to justify Trump\u2019s \u2018Armada\u2019 launching a strike on that nation.<br><br>Of course, it is likely that this is nothing more than a simple training exercise, but we think it is always sensible to take note of these events, just in case they later become part of some nefarious false flag event. <br><br>https:\/\/strategika51.wordpress.com\/<wbr>2017\/04\/25\/operation-gotham-shield-<wbr>u-s-govt-to-simulate-nuke-blast-ove<wbr>r-manhattan\/","filename":"15-Mt-on-Manhattan-500x422","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":422,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":211,"tim":1493307137261,"time":1493307137,"md5":"wRZVIOnVXdguR6IA0Bi6NQ==","fsize":64158,"resto":0,"id":"\/z3\/p74c","country":"FR","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"operation-gotham-shield-us-govt-to-simulate-nuke","country_name":"France","replies":5,"images":1,"unique_ips":4},{"no":123050570,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)11:58:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123047793\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123047793<\/a>","time":1493308728,"resto":123047793,"id":"+KavGMtd","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123051178,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)12:04:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123047793\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123047793<\/a><br><br>It seems unlikely.

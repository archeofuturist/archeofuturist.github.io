It has always been violent too, since it&#039;s inception it has mostly spread through violence and conquest. <br><br>When it first emerged it conquered into the Byzantine and Persian empires and forced their populations to convert or suffer a crippling tax, and in some situations it was convert or die. Muslim nations conquered Spain and attempted to conquer the French but were repelled at the Battle of Tours. They waged several attempted wars of conquest against the Byzantine empire (the Greeks) from the 7-11 centuries, and were only just barely repelled each time. They completely conquered the Persian Empire. All of this happened before the first Crusade ever left Europe. And those crusades were defensive wars against the expansion of Islam. <br><br>When the Saracens were conquered by the Turks the Islamic conquests of Europe continued, The Ottomans conquered Constantinople and defeated the Byzantine Empire. They then pushed into Eastern Europe where they conquered Serbia and the Romanians. This time they were defeated at the First and Second siege of Vienna and then completely driven out of the Mediterranean Sea by the Italians, Spanish and Austrians at the Battle of Lepanto. Their slave trade was even worse than ours, they castrated their blacks and imported even more of them than European slave traders.<br><br> All of these conquests point to a specific pattern of behavior, Islam is violent and expansionist. It has always been this way. It has constantly tried to conquer the West (and failed) for centuries. Europe for much of it&#039;s history has lived under constant attack from Islam. It is only very recently that we&#039;ve taken the fight to them. They realized they couldn&#039;t conquer us by force of arms so now they are attempting a subtle colonization via mass immigration and soft-power.<br><br>You are a fool not to oppose them.","time":1490360968,"resto":118061459,"id":"O1fUoyvS","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118078862,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)09:11:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"the ira don&#039;t do it on a daily basis.","time":1490361060,"resto":118061459,"id":"9i1qDCRY","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":118078931,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)09:11:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"http:\/\/www.independent.co.uk\/news\/w<wbr>orld\/politics\/swedish-immigration-i<wbr>s-not-out-of-control-it-s-actually-<wbr>getting-more-restrictive-a7605071.h<wbr>tml","time":1490361101,"resto":118061459,"id":"gks3Xz\/r","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118079060,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)09:13:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118061459\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118061459<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;YAH BREH NO BRIT EVER MESSED WITH THEM DAMN IRISH<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;#FREEPALESTEIN<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;#FROMEXISTING<\/span>","time":1490361197,"resto":118061459,"id":"n1BOj1Rw","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118079210,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)09:15:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118077925\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118077925<\/a><br>my mother is from armagh. she had her house raided so many times despite having no connection to the ira whatsoever. i know partisan politics are a bitch but imagine if a squad of isis members barged into your house searching for guns that were never there. catholic people in NI were treated like niggers on their own soil. the reason so many youth joined the ra because it was a war, same in syria and iraq. if there was no war i doubt they&#039;d come in droves to commit terrorist attacks.<br><br>theres alwas a side to take in war. then it was irish nationalists and ulster unionists. now its secular europeans against islamic arabs and secular europeans. we&#039;re at war right now, can we live in peace? yes, but it not war that we&#039;re facing, its replacement. its not weak impulse controlling faggots who blow themselves up thats the problem, its the ones who have 10 vhildren in a family. another anon said it perfectly in this thread.&quot;everyone in britain has an irish granny&quot; <br><br>do we want everyone in europe to be brown and have a token white nanny?","filename":"1489961132301","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":682,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1490361305769,"time":1490361305,"md5":"RnyYg3+aBtuMnGZ2fdYsUQ==","fsize":137113,"resto":118061459,"id":"aGh+cNZw","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"},{"no":118079301,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)09:16:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118078931\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118078931<\/a><br>lel","time":1490361364,"resto":118061459,"id":"ms4bmX95","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":118079306,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)09:16:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118078723\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118078723<\/a><br>\/thread","time":1490361367,"resto":118061459,"id":"zLX0iISI","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":118079429,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)09:17:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118078116\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118078116<\/a><br>the ra got the most kills. most of them were soldiers<br><br>uvf got the most civilains in poportion to their numbers","time":1490361465,"resto":118061459,"id":"aGh+cNZw","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"},{"no":118079658,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)09:20:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118068238\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118068238<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;WHY WE HATE YOU FIGHT YOU<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;...<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;We hate you, first an foremost, because you are disbelievers.<\/span><br>-- Dabiq, The Islamic State","time":1490361639,"resto":118061459,"id":"zgn7r5Ou","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118079677,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)09:20:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118061459\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118061459<\/a><br><br>Most of them were literally citizens of the United Kingdom.

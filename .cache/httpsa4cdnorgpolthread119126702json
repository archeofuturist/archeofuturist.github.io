If they know the incredible lethality rate of fentanyl, it&#039;s just potentially killing someone for no reason and losing profit from a potential repeat. Are they mixing them together by accident when they&#039;re chopping up their shit? What kind of coke operation has dudes chopping up fentanyl next to blow? The plug drops off a key, the dealer cuts it up himself and keeps on breaking it off down the line.<br><br>I can see a grungy drug dealer who deals to addicts doing this but that kills the narrative that &quot;they&#039;re buying it off a street guy they don&#039;t know.&quot; What kind of casual drug user goes to a dangerous area of town and buys coke off a street person? Why wouldn&#039;t they ask a friend, a bouncer, someone at the club like a normal person? <br><br>This doesn&#039;t really apply to the fucking dregs lining East Hastings who are dying from fentanyl, it just applies to casual users. This, however, brings me to my next point:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The fentanyl epidemic is the solution of the BC Government to wipe away the disgusting sludge of humanity that inhabits the Downtown Eastside. This is millions and millions of dollars worth of real estate that is currently rotting away as SROs and occupied by scum. Tourists can&#039;t go there, it&#039;s a home base for the bums as they scrounge around the city stealing, bumming, leaving trash, and harassing passerbys.<\/span><br><br>It&#039;s too much money to not have people do something about it, and I think the occasional inexperienced casual drug user is the collateral damage.","time":1491011978,"resto":119126702,"id":"pI8lEUm2","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119129801,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)21:59:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"Just fucking <br><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/28rJqj-7pEY","time":1491011985,"resto":119126702,"id":"\/6qPHbwl","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119129811,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)21:59:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119129724\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119129724<\/a><br>i used to used hard drugs years ago and sometimes i have dreams about using drugs and i actually feel high in the dream","time":1491011990,"resto":119126702,"id":"\/blFcYur","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119129822,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)21:59:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119129724\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119129724<\/a><br>American junkies should just die.

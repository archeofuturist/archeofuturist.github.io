If they know the incredible lethality rate of fentanyl, it&#039;s just potentially killing someone for no reason and losing profit from a potential repeat. Are they mixing them together by accident when they&#039;re chopping up their shit? What kind of coke operation has dudes chopping up fentanyl next to blow? The plug drops off a key, the dealer cuts it up himself and keeps on breaking it off down the line.<br><br>I can see a grungy drug dealer who deals to addicts doing this but that kills the narrative that &quot;they&#039;re buying it off a street guy they don&#039;t know.&quot; What kind of casual drug user goes to a dangerous area of town and buys coke off a street person? Why wouldn&#039;t they ask a friend, a bouncer, someone at the club like a normal person? <br><br>This doesn&#039;t really apply to the fucking dregs lining East Hastings who are dying from fentanyl, it just applies to casual users. This, however, brings me to my next point:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The fentanyl epidemic is the solution of the BC Government to wipe away the disgusting sludge of humanity that inhabits the Downtown Eastside.

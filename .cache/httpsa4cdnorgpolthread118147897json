From the client&#039;s point of view (your Web browser), the server&#039;s public key is obtained through the server&#039;s certificate. The certificate is validated relatively to the root CA which are embedded in your computer. The ISP will not be able to obtain a fake certificate mimicking that of the server you are trying to talk to.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Spying on you thus requires at least one of the following:<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The ISP is in league with a big commercial CA, and can obtain fake certificates.

E.g. a &quot;connection kit&quot;.

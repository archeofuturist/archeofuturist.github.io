Not only that, but there are also consequences beyond the socially ideological. Larger families need less space per capita to live well and can pool economic resources collectively, and with property and living expenses so high right now, this may benefit people very much.<br><br>Finally, studies show that exposure to close knit social groups such as large families is very good for peoples&#039; mental health, and keeps them happy and connected to others and society much more than atomized individuals away from others.<br><br>With all that in mind, would society be better off returning to a more extended family lifestyle? And if so, what measures should be taken to achieve it?","filename":"image","ext":".jpg","w":474,"h":629,"tn_w":188,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492012459322,"time":1492012459,"md5":"O4ohJhnFlmRYyNanN91Jsg==","fsize":81348,"resto":0,"id":"gmWH9qq2","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"what-happened-to-extended-families","country_name":"United States","replies":29,"images":3,"unique_ips":19},{"no":120770372,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)11:55:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120770281\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120770281<\/a><br>T H I C C<br>H<br>I<br>C<br>C","time":1492012506,"resto":120770281,"id":"BY+jYapZ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120770457,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)11:55:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120770281\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120770281<\/a>","filename":"dc","ext":".jpg","w":960,"h":960,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492012549762,"time":1492012549,"md5":"x15w\/IVi8XbtXBY4beDxMQ==","fsize":154727,"resto":120770281,"id":"jcl2Nh5+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120770510,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)11:56:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120770281\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120770281<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;collectivist trying to collect<\/span><br>*yawn*<br>The age of the individual is here you social luddite","time":1492012575,"resto":120770281,"id":"cehJc4a2","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120770533,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)11:56:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120770281\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120770281<\/a><br>It&#039;s for italians and minorities<br><br>Whites should live in nuclear familities when possibe","time":1492012590,"resto":120770281,"id":"3H+Z+qf\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120770960,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)12:00:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120770533\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120770533<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;It&#039;s for Italians<\/span><br>Can confirm, I have a huge extended Italian family in Australia (I hardly know them today).

Are you implying that only shit minority non-white groups do it and therefore it&#039;s inherently bad? I laid out some of the reasons I think it would be a good thing, for one it would allow whites living in cities to actually own homes for a large family and establish property and capital, which is pretty much impossible for anybody but the wealthiest people living in cities. If anything it would allow whites to amass greater power as a group, and blacks and mestizos\/hispanics don&#039;t live with their extended families at this point anyway.<br><a href=\"#p120770510\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120770510<\/a><br>Collectivism is pretty much necessary if we want to improve and continue, we need to ensure resources are distributed well, that people are willing to sacrifice to improve the world, that technologies aren&#039;t abused by an elite few to fuck over everybody else, etc.<br><a href=\"#p120770533\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120770533<\/a><br>Why not do it though if there are definitely social and individual benefits for doing it, even if atm it isn&#039;t the social norm?

Do they have normal intelligence? You could get a large knife or a sword and just cut them all over, and they would not die cause they are 99% just a fat blob. How come people don&#039;t do this? Like at WalMart, why dont people sneak up from behind and shove a dagger in their fat and then see what they do? Will they even notice it? If they dont notice that they have shit their pants as they often do maybe they wont notice a knife in their fat either.<br><br>Im not from America so I dont see these fat people around, any american can enlighten me on these things, and have you ever cut off some fat of one?","filename":"america","ext":".png","w":1096,"h":878,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":200,"tim":1492380795554,"time":1492380795,"md5":"o74MNbEnormQQct4GhdK3w==","fsize":1483072,"resto":0,"id":"Fa4KXjcR","country":"SE","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"anyone-else-gets-a-urge-to-cut-obese-people-its","country_name":"Sweden","replies":32,"images":5,"unique_ips":28},{"no":121427064,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)18:22:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"what","time":1492381356,"resto":121425415,"id":"NSg8lSos","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121427312,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)18:24:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"I think that might not be legal.","time":1492381450,"resto":121425415,"id":"bDBEc0i1","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121427622,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)18:26:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"What does it for me are lunchbox fatties who can&#039;t buy clothes to cover their guts.

the entirety of France thinks about their own election, but also what it is like to live there as an actual citizen, is someone who is making a lot of assumptions that it isn&#039;t their place be making in the first place. Paris is full of tourists and attracts concentrated degeneracy, it doesn&#039;t represent the entire French population. People who visited America during our election thought that there was no way Trump would come out on top. My point is you can&#039;t just up and make assumptions about a country you haven&#039;t lived in, after only taking a vacation there, with a pre-conceived notion of what you will see there, just so you can shitpost on \/pol\/ about how you were right and are 100% certain that a particular candidate has no chance of winning the French election that you yourself have nothing to do with.","time":1492890664,"resto":122315507,"id":"3j8Oafrr","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122318555,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)15:51:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122317805\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122317805<\/a><br>IT&#039;S HER TURN YOU BIGOT","time":1492890669,"resto":122315507,"id":"xLCs7rfV","country":"RO","country_name":"Romania"},{"no":122318686,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)15:52:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122318101\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122318101<\/a><br>how do you as french view the immigrants?<br>Do you hate them, are you accustomed to them?<br>Do they still get dirty looks on the streets?","time":1492890733,"resto":122315507,"id":"DdIOVIft","country":"EE","country_name":"Estonia"},{"no":122318705,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)15:52:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122317805\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122317805<\/a><br>It&#039;s not about the people nor what they are<br>it&#039;s about putting the best person for the job","time":1492890740,"resto":122315507,"id":"r+ApaXee","country":"DK","country_name":"Denmark"},{"no":122318885,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)15:53:49","name":"Anonymous","filename":"fr-cremerie-pomi-my-bad-its-paris-understandable-mistake-3582089","ext":".png","w":500,"h":442,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":110,"tim":1492890829264,"time":1492890829,"md5":"hFc\/O++MA1hZ8ChDRICySQ==","fsize":151873,"resto":122315507,"id":"qZItAldK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122318902,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)15:53:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122315507\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122315507<\/a><br>Cletus you never left Alabama so fuck off<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;sage<\/span>","time":1492890837,"resto":122315507,"id":"HSvwK\/g8","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":122318976,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)15:54:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122318705\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122318705<\/a><br>This. <br>If Le Penn wasn&#039;t the anti-degeneracy candidate then \/pol\/ wouldn&#039;t give a damn about voting for her at all.

There is no pre-determined curriculum. The students only learn what they want to learn based on coming to the teachers, sharing their interests, and having the teachers facilitate learning about those interests through their own knowledge on the subject, internet, books, resources or field trips to meet professionals who can teach more about it. There are no tests, homework, or even grades. There is no separation by age and students are all free to move around the school together. There are classrooms but they are only used when a teacher wants to teach something specific and are always optional. When the school opened, they started with an empty rule book, but of course, they immediately held an assembly to come up with some community guidelines. The students and teachers have decided every rule, every field trip, every major decision together through direct democracy- with each person getting one vote.<\/span>","filename":"Screen Shot 2017-03-27 at 5.45.14 PM","ext":".png","w":373,"h":394,"tn_w":118,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492843020502,"time":1492843020,"md5":"yYIn7NKhba4e0KFySENL4Q==","fsize":200682,"resto":122243713,"id":"+ectVbuH","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122246887,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)02:37:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122246705\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122246705<\/a><br>Okay, so why the picture?","time":1492843055,"resto":122243713,"id":"gDDb\/cCV","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122247194,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)02:40:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Half-assed preformative posturing is going to alienate masses<\/span><br><br>Half-assed preformative posturing is what masses do best","time":1492843254,"resto":122243713,"id":"m+0w9e+i","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122247241,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)02:41:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122246842\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122246842<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I think the education system should be common through all anarchist entities in a same are, for equality purposes.

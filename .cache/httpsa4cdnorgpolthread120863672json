The double slit experiment proves that matter isn&#039;t quite what we think it is because when we fire a particles, electrons, buckyballs etc. at two slits one would expect to see two corresponding of deposits of particles on the wall behind the slits. To the surprise of any physicist and or materialist what we see is a diffraction pattern- a wave deposit on the wall. But how can matter act like a wave? To figure out how this could happen many more tests were conducted and each time we watched which slit the particles actually went through the wave collapsed and we see two corresponding deposits on the wall. The very act of measuring collapses the waveform. These tests have been repeated hundreds and thousands of times. The result is inescapable. In a materialistic world this is not possible. In a simulated world that is not actually real it is. Most physicists shrugged this off as equipment somehow causing interference with the experiments. However in a recent followup experiment not only were the initial findings confirmed but proven beyond a doubt that matter and the world isn&#039;t what we think it is. Delayed quantum eraser adds a change to the path after the particle has already been fired. Yet the particle acts as if it knew the change would happen before the additional half silver mirror was added. This implies the particle is somehow intelligent or that it can read the future. Again in a materialistic world this is not possible.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;info on double slit in general<\/span><br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=DfP<wbr>eprQ7oGc<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;info on follow up study and material world being wrong<\/span><br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=t_R<wbr>wcGzGurc","time":1492060912,"resto":120863672,"id":"PkE4MORh","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120872151,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)01:22:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"What effect can you have upon politicians and world leaders?

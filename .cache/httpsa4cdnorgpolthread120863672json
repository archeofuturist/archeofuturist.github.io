US MSM is totally focused on making this happen. 9\/11 was a huge fog that took a decade to clear; in that time the surveillance grid was installed worldwide. Meanwhile, Hollywood took the edge off content and increased the trends of manchildren, global fantasy universes about mass destruction and tribes of heroes -- basically Biblical stories for a consumerist audience. <br><br>Local news and cable, CNN obvs, were streamlined ; the Middle East was telegraphed as an epic threat, while the civilians there were projected as a SJW cause for immigration to further overwhelm infrastructures, education systems, and local resources in traditionally white countries. We never hear about metropolises in &quot;flyover states&quot; unless violence and progressive disruption occurs. <br><br>The internet has been clamped down by Facebook, where Zuckerberg sold the Internet back to us and reaped the reward while controlling the surveillance grid outside federal reach. This has increased conformity of thought in ways immeasurable. And transcorps filter all content to fit the agenda, which younger generations accept as gospel. <br><br>US politicians like McCain are bribed using the $6 TRILLION missing from our Federal Reserve --not a typo, it&#039;s on YouTube. The entire focus is on arranging Greater Israel. They are also gifted life extension meds and procedures mastered in Israel. <br><br>Middle class obv destroyed by intentional &quot;Great Recession&quot; and opioids. Replaced by Walmart pajama class and welfare class. 2001 is when SHTF and went into high gear. Radical terrorism is filling the delay of Agenda 21 and Agenda 2030 green\/clean\/smart programs, but those are on deck. Trump will flip on that too. <br><br>Hate speech laws amping up very soon. 4chan has about two years left. More &quot;media&quot; than ever, but less &quot;fringe&quot; survives. Being pro-American but Israel-neutral\/negative is a no-no. Exploit Christianity, is kill.","filename":"116987567IuRPMv_fs","ext":".jpg","w":400,"h":233,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":72,"tim":1492058713573,"time":1492058713,"md5":"pf2Y\/410FEqhS0fbdWZtxQ==","fsize":17566,"resto":120863672,"id":"d36Ve5q+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120868528,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)00:46:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120868365\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120868365<\/a><br>This guy knows what&#039;s up.","time":1492058809,"resto":120863672,"id":"KQOUFjBS","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120868589,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)00:47:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120867356\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120867356<\/a>","filename":"strg","ext":".jpg","w":300,"h":437,"tn_w":85,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492058849246,"time":1492058849,"md5":"I89tHMMv3Tj8qf5miVrP7A==","fsize":37251,"resto":120863672,"id":"NxTmkMMB","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120868784,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)00:49:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120863672\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120863672<\/a><br>the quarantine is slowly being lifted<br>the planet is evolving to green ray density","time":1492058956,"resto":120863672,"id":"qLXwKWOv","country":"AT","country_name":"Austria"},{"no":120868997,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)00:51:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120865481\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120865481<\/a><br><a href=\"#p120866262\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120866262<\/a><br>There was a kids next door episode that did something similar to this.","time":1492059074,"resto":120863672,"id":"jgz1B30H","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120869542,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)00:56:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"Look, there&#039;s going to be a lot of theories and discussions.

Most people stray far away from chaos (because they are loser cowards afraid of themselves as every person has a control\/freedom (see order\/chaos) split persona because the Earth reality has many different steppes of being, all based on perspective and place of &quot;at&quot;.

He also pointed that 17.6 million men paid \u00a3121.0 billion, an average of \u00a36,875 per person per annum, and 13.1 million women paid \u00a345.5 billion, an average of \u00a33,473 which is just over half (50.5 per cent) that paid by male taxpayers. While this fact is well known to us, it is little spoken of in the Mainstream Media, simply because it doesn\u2019t fit the narrative.<\/span>","filename":"1476477618003","ext":".jpg","w":1920,"h":1200,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":156,"tim":1491044890098,"time":1491044890,"md5":"h4O75XvYFzS5R3K3zxYr0Q==","fsize":320730,"resto":0,"id":"5XAY0Ayl","country":"IL","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"men-pay-75-billion-more-tax-than-women-every-year","country_name":"Israel","replies":2,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":119170001,"now":"04\/01\/17(Sat)07:09:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"Is this a picture or a painting?

Although I like the speakers, I couldn&#039;t help it but to notice the pro-Semitic vibe that was present throughout the whole event. How could the outright Trump supporters and anti-leftist-establishment people so blatantly ignore the direct impact of said Semitic establishments on the destabilization of the Middle East and thus the uncontrollable influx of the Muslim immigrants they hate so much. I&#039;m not the biggest fan of Islamic culture myself, you see, but the ignorance spewed on that conference was beyond your day-to-day victim cow milking. So many questions...

Your consciousness is fueled by and made up of chemical reactions happening constantly among your nerves and cells, once you die, those all stop. Nothing happens &quot;mentally&quot; or &quot;spiritually&quot; after death, why is that so hard for people to accept? Are you so pretentious and selfish that you feel like you MUST have a purpose in the universe and that death isn&#039;t really the end of the line? You, me, and anyone else who reads this is less significant than a grain of sand on the Earth when compared to the entirety of the universe, we are not special. Give it up, facts don&#039;t care about your feelings. This is the brutal truth, you can learn to accept it or live blissfully while basking in your own ignorance.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;inb4 hurr durr energy cant be destroyed, only change forms<\/span><br><br>Your &quot;energy&quot; is radiated in the form of heat (photons) every instant of your life, and happens after death until you have no more energy.

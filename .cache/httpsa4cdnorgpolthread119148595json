The law is named after British journalist John O\u2019Sullivan.<br><br>Television shows are the best examples of this. 24, House. Charitable foundations are worse but harder to see.<br><br>One of the reasons for this is leftist intolerance versus right-wing tolerance. Right wingers are willing to hire openly left-wing employees in the interest of fairness. Left-wingers, utterly intolerant, will not allow a non-Liberal near them, and will harass them at every opportunity. The result over time is that conservative enterprises are infiltrated by leftists but leftist enterprises remain the same or get worse.<br><br>Also, leftism is in and of itself a form of decay. It\u2019s what happens not just to television shows but to nations, churches and universities as the energy given off by the big bang of their inception slowly ebbs away. Rather than expend vitality in originality and creation they become obsessed with introspection, popularity and lethargy.

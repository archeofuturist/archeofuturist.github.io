You can&#039;t make grain out of government, you need farmers willing to work hard for that.","time":1491480669,"resto":119727985,"id":"G9ibc43S","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":119736268,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)08:11:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119736082\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119736082<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Japan has left the server<\/span>","time":1491480675,"resto":119727985,"id":"tRx+p\/0P","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119736312,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)08:11:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"Doesn&#039;t matter<br>what really matter is<br>2B &gt; A2","time":1491480709,"resto":119727985,"id":"x6ieT2Qs","country":"TN","country_name":"Tunisia"},{"no":119736313,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)08:11:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119727985\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119727985<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;no bulge<\/span><br>\u7d76\u5bfe\u306b\u30ad\u30e2\u30a4","filename":"disgusting-1412107887753","ext":".jpg","w":704,"h":400,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":71,"tim":1491480710189,"time":1491480710,"md5":"ki2oO\/ozrzC0EccNBO3xow==","fsize":8968,"resto":119727985,"id":"U7CAivRb","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119736412,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)08:12:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119735801\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119735801<\/a><br>You are a peasant friend, i mean fuck there are more people with PhDs than people who qualify for mensa.

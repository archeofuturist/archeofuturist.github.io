In the first decade of this century, he did what Kemal Atat\u00fcrk had done in Turkey in the 1920s. Out of a crumbling empire, he rescued a nation-state, and gave it coherence and purpose. He disciplined his country\u2019s plutocrats. He restored its military strength. And he refused, with ever blunter rhetoric, to accept for Russia a subservient role in an American-run world system drawn up by foreign politicians and business leaders.

That is an ignominy that falls on Boris Yeltsin. Yeltsin\u2019s reckless opportunism made him an indispensable foe of Communism in the late 1980s. But it made him an inadequate founding father for a modern state.

Will we continue looting and destroying Russia until nothing is left?\u201d That was the year Putin came to power.

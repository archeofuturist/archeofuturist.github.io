Actually, it&#039;s not clear that all those on &quot;the right&quot; support anything universally! Take two of the aforementioned groups, the libertarians and the fascists. One would be hard-pressed to find any common ground between these two groups. The modern libertarian movement was spurred, largely, by F.A. Hayek&#039;s 1944 book, &quot;The Road to Serfdom&quot;, where he described Germany&#039;s slide from socialism to fascism and argued that a similar process could happen elsewhere. Hayek opposed socialism because he saw it as a stepping-stone towards fascism. He feared that coercive powers accrued by the state, even for benign purposes such as the promotion of social justice or of economic equality, would eventually fall into the hands of those who would use those powers to tyrannize and enslave.","filename":"m335","ext":".jpg","w":1238,"h":939,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":189,"tim":1493229439075,"time":1493229439,"md5":"80WxXkAV1snvcnpaxkqoWA==","fsize":297831,"resto":0,"id":"YRjzRc5a","country":"CA","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"its-clear-that-not-all-of-those-on-the-right","country_name":"Canada","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

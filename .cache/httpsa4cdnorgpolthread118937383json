Folkish Socialism focuses on the individual and understands the hard worker deserves more reward then the lazy, whereas Marxist Socialism does not. Folkish Socialists support the rights of the worker, Hitler created the first laws in which all factories HAD to have rest rooms and break rooms for their workers, Marxist Socialists wouldn&#039;t care if their workers died from tuberculosis. Lastly, National Socialists support the free market, whereas Marxist Socialists do not. <br><br>2:) The National Socialists where &quot;Germanic Supremacists&quot;<br><br>Not at all, National Socialism in Germany meant that Germany has for GERMAN PEOPLE, and that Germans took GREAT PRIDE in themselves. National Socialism has widespread across Europe and the white-world in the pre-war, war-time and post-war era, even today. The Waffen SS, in which its members where considered to best Germany had to offer, had volunteers from across Europe, not just Germanic Nations.<br><br>3:) National Socialism did not work.<br><br>It did! When Hitler came to power, there where 7 million unemployed Germans, in just a year, he has reduced it to 30,000. And no, this wasn&#039;t because of militarization, Hitler found great ways of creating new jobs for the volk of Germany, such as the creation of affordable cars so that more and more needed to be produced, which would give almost all German families a affordable vehicle, and a huge space for car manufacturing. He also created massive work forces, which did great things, from planting trees to motorway construction.<br>National Socialist Germany became the poorest country in Europe to the RICHEST in just a few years.","filename":"9cf35437ce0c4259ba24c37361da32aa_18","ext":".jpg","w":1000,"h":562,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1490891541415,"time":1490891541,"md5":"ymBlja0gSrstbf2NcjHJeA==","fsize":293318,"resto":0,"id":"sB6KNedy","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"myths-surrounding-national-socialism-and-the","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

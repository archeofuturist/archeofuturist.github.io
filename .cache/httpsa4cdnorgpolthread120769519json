Peterson is a very good speaker and is a good storyteller. Basically, he has something interesting to say and articulates in a novel style. Even though what he&#039;s saying isn&#039;t exactly too mind blowing to an educated person, there is humility and honesty is his lectures-- which is so unique these days it&#039;s refreshing. It&#039;s like if you&#039;re used to &quot;aunt jemima&quot; commercial shit syrup, when you taste actual syrup it&#039;s amazing. For a young person in STEM who&#039;s only been exposed to the goy-approved, stale, completely mind numbing version of (((humanities))), Peterson is great. At the very least, it&#039;s a great reminder that psychology is a very interesting field. <br><br>If you want a good intro to Dr. Peterson&#039;s style here is a great intro lecture.

Set a goal you can achieve, set some incentive for it, and then do it. At some point you do just have to force yourself to do it, but you can make that process easier. For instance, say today you&#039;ll read for 15 minutes uninterrupted. If you think you can&#039;t do that, set a goal of reading for 15 minutes, and after you do that you can play some video game without guilt. Then the next day maybe you do 20 minutes, or whatever. You stretch a little everyday, and in a short time you&#039;ll be far more productive. It&#039;s like weightlifting or any other activity. I used to not be able to deadlift 135lbs. So I started at 100, and increased by 5lbs every workout.

The creative process, so far as we are able to follow it at all, consists in the unconscious activation of an archetypal image, and in elaborating and shaping this image into the finished work. By giving it shape, the artist translates it into the language of the present, and so makes it possible for us to find our way back to the deepest springs of life. Therein lies the social significance of art: it is constantly at work educating the spirit of the age, conjuring up the forms in which the age is most lacking. The unsatisfied yearning of the artist reaches back to the primordial image in the unconscious which is best fitted to compensate the inadequacy and one-sidedness of the present. The artist seizes on this image, and in raising it from deepest unconsciousness he brings it into relation with conscious values, thereby transforming it until it can be accepted by the minds of his contemporaries according to their powers.<\/span>","time":1492021818,"resto":120769519,"id":"jiQbIbGG","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120788486,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)14:31:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120787898\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120787898<\/a><br>not him but P4G got me into Jung<br><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/v3VxnGVMtIw?t=1m41<wbr>s","time":1492021919,"resto":120769519,"id":"nIqG5JvX","country":"GR","country_name":"Greece"},{"no":120788627,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)14:33:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120787898\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120787898<\/a><br><br>Read this instead.

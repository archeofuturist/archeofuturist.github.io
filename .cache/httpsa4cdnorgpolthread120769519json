Peterson is a very good speaker and is a good storyteller. Basically, he has something interesting to say and articulates in a novel style. Even though what he&#039;s saying isn&#039;t exactly too mind blowing to an educated person, there is humility and honesty is his lectures-- which is so unique these days it&#039;s refreshing. It&#039;s like if you&#039;re used to &quot;aunt jemima&quot; commercial shit syrup, when you taste actual syrup it&#039;s amazing. For a young person in STEM who&#039;s only been exposed to the goy-approved, stale, completely mind numbing version of (((humanities))), Peterson is great. At the very least, it&#039;s a great reminder that psychology is a very interesting field. <br><br>If you want a good intro to Dr. Peterson&#039;s style here is a great intro lecture.

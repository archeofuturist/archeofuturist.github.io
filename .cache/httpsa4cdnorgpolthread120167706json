Furthermore, why are there more videos of the plane hitting from the side\/rear? WELL basic math and a few assumptions tell us that the tower has 4 (FOUR) sides, and the plane hit 1 (ONE) of them. That means there&#039;s going to be roughly 3 times as many people standing to one of the sides that didn&#039;t get hit, as there are standing on the side that got hit, so there will statistically be 3 times as much footage of sides or opposite side, than of the side they were hit. Even more because manhattan is an island and people cant live on the hudson.","time":1491695529,"resto":120167706,"id":"Ikoz1odf","country":"DK","country_name":"Denmark"},{"no":120203794,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)19:52:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120185409\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120185409<\/a><br><a href=\"#p120203449\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120203449<\/a><br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=hId<wbr>z3G0qmKk<br><br>Never mind I guess. 4:20 (lel)","time":1491695567,"resto":120167706,"id":"OYhhkZAg","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120203980,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)19:54:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120167706\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120167706<\/a><br>just fucking google &quot;9-11 jumpers&quot; the 12th result is a compilation of fucking annihilated bodies lying on the ground.","time":1491695655,"resto":120167706,"id":"EZT85D8s","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120204137,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)19:55:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120171015\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120171015<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;2) yes, manhattan has lots of buildings...and people..with cameras<\/span><br>How old are you, kid?

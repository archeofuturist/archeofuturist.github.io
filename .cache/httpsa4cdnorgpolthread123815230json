I was born in a Communist country myself and I still cannot understand why a Westerner (who pretty much has everything) would want to live in a Communist country. To this day I&#039;ve never met a Cuban or North Korean who praises that shitty political ideology, yet I&#039;m always forced to listen to privilege kiddies go on about how great it would be. Fucking why? This is like those Arabs who flee Islam and Sharia Law, settle in a Western country, just to have to deal with those Western kiddies protest about how they want Islam and Sharia Law. Why do they do this?","filename":"desiretoknowmore","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":512,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":200,"tim":1493757160130,"time":1493757160,"md5":"GcVLhW8+lZeqm4DEDnIELw==","fsize":41541,"resto":0,"id":"wLWe9OKK","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"pol-please-help-me-understand-the-mentality-of","country_name":"United States","replies":9,"images":1,"unique_ips":7},{"no":123815382,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)16:34:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123815230\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123815230<\/a><br>The grass is always greener on the other side.","time":1493757250,"resto":123815230,"id":"Fn3DxFEm","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123815441,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)16:34:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"you have to live through things to understand them.","time":1493757276,"resto":123815230,"id":"LhAo2fJZ","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123816935,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)16:47:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123815230\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123815230<\/a><br>Its actually pretty simple. <br>They have no purpose. <br><br>The biggest fault of the comfortable western life is the struggle is practically gone for, you guessed it, upper middle class kids.<br><br>Their parents have every resource to enable their asinine whims, so everything comes easy.

It&#039;s like with Trump&#039;s wall, it will force Mexico to either get its shit together or collapse, but with the drug industry it&#039;s keeping it on limbo, rotten yet not dead. It&#039;s the same here, with so many weed flowing to Europe. It is keepin us corrupted, in a foul stasis, unable to progress or regress. If Europe would isolate us, then it would put us on a similar position, either live or die. To me, those odds are acceptable.","filename":"IMG_4349","ext":".jpg","w":480,"h":360,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1492372782597,"time":1492372782,"md5":"Hq214xzaX7RmgWIvrXJMNw==","fsize":44144,"resto":0,"id":"XRxJlz9U","country":"AL","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"similarity-between-albania-and-mexico","country_name":"Albania","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

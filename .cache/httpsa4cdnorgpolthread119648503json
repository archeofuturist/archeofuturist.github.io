I live by the rule &quot;if it doesen&#039;t bother me, and i am not forced to like it then let the people enjoy it&quot;. I also belive that education and healtcare should be provided by the state on every level. Another of my economics beliefs is that for free market to thrive we should have it harshly regulated to avoid corporations gaining more power. i Despise sjw and kkk-like entities (thou the latter has better jokes). third european culture and craftsmanship is superior than that in the USA. Lastly i mean you no ill will and like to hear your opinion.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;pic unrelated<\/span>","filename":"190px-Franz_Josef_I_in_Kaiserj\u00e4geruniform","ext":".jpg","w":190,"h":366,"tn_w":129,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491422610818,"time":1491422610,"md5":"W2eTaLoCjQchY1Zb3K\/Wtw==","fsize":17439,"resto":0,"id":"fNVMK339","country":"PL","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"my-manifesto","country_name":"Poland","replies":3,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":119649350,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)16:11:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"Nice blog!","time":1491423061,"resto":119648503,"id":"PWH8uChD","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119649481,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)16:12:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"So basically you belief in:<br>Small Government for social issues<br>Large Government for economic issues<br><br>The problem with this is that without checks and balances, large governments tend to spread to sectors them don&#039;t belong and small governments have trouble enforcing the law. In other words, a government of your style would originally be founded to regulate the economy but not touch social issues. With the amount of power it would control regulating the economy, it would eventually spread to regulating social issues as well. Europe doesn&#039;t have anything like the Second Amendment to theoretically keep tyranny in check, so you are then stuck with a nanny state.","time":1491423123,"resto":119648503,"id":"dR1iadyp","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119649508,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)16:12:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119649350\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119649350<\/a><br>i had ruff month so i wanted to put my words to a paper and share it","time":1491423135,"resto":119648503,"id":"fNVMK339","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"}]}

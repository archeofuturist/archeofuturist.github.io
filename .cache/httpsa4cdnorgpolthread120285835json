Porn is a slippery slope that leads to more compromise. Establish boundaries and walls for your own protection. It doesn&#039;t make you a punk or soft for admitting that you struggle. Most guys do. Mainly, it&#039;s important to avoid situations where you&#039;re gonna be tempted. If you notice that certain patterns are emerging, that&#039;s your cue to get up and go. Get out more, do actual tasks that require you to use your hands beneficially instead if destructively. Everything will be okay. If you&#039;re a praying man, then pray. If you don&#039;t believe in God, then just take time and do something positive. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;t.

No erectile disfunction, this is a meme or a sideeffect of literally jerking off ten times a day. Not depressed, not motivated either too much but periods of nofap have never had an effect on that, therefore it doesnt seem to be the cause. Not addicted whatsoever, can stop now and stay stopped for a month without even trying. No excessive whacking here either, nothing is stopping you from whacking twice a week for example.

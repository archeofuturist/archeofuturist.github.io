This is because deflation (as in, negative inflation) makes warranties lose value in relation to debt, which discourages lending and investment and therefore hampers economic growth.<br>It hasn&#039;t always been so. In the 19th century inflation was unheard of, but it eventually came to be when WWI forced most countries to print money in order to fund the war effort. Everyone except the US went broke, which essentially annihilated the gold standard that had kept the system stable. Moreover, when keynesian principles became the new standards, governments started prioritizing full employment and according to Phillips curve you have to choose between low inflation and low unemployment. So basically after WWII double digit inflation wasn&#039;t unheard of. This continued until the 70&#039;s oil shock, where increase of money supply didn&#039;t lead to decreased unemployment, which couldn&#039;t be explained by the keynesian models back then.

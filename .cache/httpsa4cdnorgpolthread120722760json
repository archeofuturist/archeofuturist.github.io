Collective Jewish guilt is just as ignorant and wrongheaded as collective white guilt. It diminishes our movement in the eyes of the public as a hateful lunatic fringe, and this allows them to more willfully close their eyes to the evils of the Jewish elites. There are millions of Reformed Jews who find Zionism and racist Jewish supremacists to be repulsive and against the core message of the Torah. There are millions more secular Jews who couldn&#039;t give two shits about Greater Israel or any other Zionist bullshit, and just want to live their lives in peace like any other human being.","filename":"MILA-KUNIS-WHEN-YOU-SEE-IT-DAMN-jpg.xpng","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":504,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":210,"tim":1491977451719,"time":1491977451,"md5":"V14rrsYl2adEFl3FW36JSA==","fsize":42095,"resto":0,"id":"p0azoE6C","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"this-is-your-daily-reminder-that-our-enemies-are","country_name":"United States","replies":14,"images":2,"unique_ips":9},{"no":120723125,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)02:15:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120722760\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120722760<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Zionism<\/span><br>What&#039;s wrong with that though?

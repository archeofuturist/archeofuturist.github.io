The place where the Reconquista begun. Up until the late XX century, Asturias had a strong family\/cooperative based, smallholding agricultural network. Each family had only 3 or 4 cows, roaming free in the Asturian nature, yet it was enough to keep the whole place economically thriving. <br><br>Enter globalism. It first arrives in the form of the EU. In 1991, Maastrich&#039;s Treaty deprives the right of these families to keep producing high quality milk and meat the way they did for centuries. The proto-EU transfers milk production to other parts of Europe (mainly France), where industrialization is applied to the production of milk and meat: now thousands of cows are fed GMO shit, antibiotics, growth and female hormones, while kept stacked and motionless in hellish industrial buildings. <br><br>As a result, the agricultural network of Asturian villages disappears in just a couple of years. Thousands of citizens have to abandon their traditional way of living and join the rest of the population in the polution-ridden urban areas, unable to find a job away from the farmsteads. Soon, most of the population degenerates and becomes prisoner of the debt scheme, of the advertisement hell that is globalist mall-culture. <br><br>I&#039;ve seen this repeated everywhere in Europe.

They&#039;d definitely put up a solid fight. We can&#039;t do a ton about the massive amounts of artillery they&#039;d use. We can&#039;t shoot those shells down like we can missiles. They&#039;d probably lose in the end due to the fact that they&#039;d focus on striking Japan and South Korea out of retaliation but if it were a one-on-one battle, US vs NK, they&#039;d be wiped off the map.<br><br>It&#039;s important to note that they do have some huge advantages however. For one, they&#039;ve had 50+ years to prepare. Kim Jong Il used to brag about how he had turned North Korea into a &quot;hedgehog&quot; meaning, they had spines in all directions and couldn&#039;t be attacked easily by any other animal without that animal also being gravely injured. It&#039;s a bit of an exaggeration but he&#039;s right. You can&#039;t take out North Korea without millions in collateral damage. Also, they&#039;ve bored out much of the country. They have bunkers and caverns everywhere and it&#039;s rumored they could shelter over half of the country&#039;s citizens from a nuclear strike. This is basically the same reason we let Iran continue to make threats constantly. We can&#039;t really attack them because they have a huge geological advantages (they&#039;re surrounded by mountains). Either way, we&#039;d eventually win but it would be a shitty battle.<br><br>This also assumes that the rumors of their EMP satellites are false. If those are in play, then fuck I don&#039;t know if the US would win.","time":1493318661,"resto":123067497,"id":"e6zOyIkC","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123070494,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)14:52:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123069478\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123069478<\/a><br>I don&#039;t think the USA could sustain a war where they lose 100k+ soldiers. The pentagon had previously estimated it would cost at least that many casualties to occupy North Korea. <br><br>Given how bad they are at estimating shit, just look at Iraq and Afghanistan, we can guess that it will be at least 5x as bad as they think. I don&#039;t think the US morale at home could tolerate that kind of body count. <br><br>Throw in the potential for EMP disruption and an already fractured nation due to the fast pace of immigration by ethnic groups hostile to the USA, and you have a recipe for balkanization even if we manage to occupy north korea in the end.","time":1493319161,"resto":123067497,"id":"JXrLuaEm","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123070562,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)14:53:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123067497\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123067497<\/a><br><br>Reminder the US murdered 10% of north koreas pop, murdered millions globally since then, is on north koreas borders, and north korea has never invaded anyone.<br><br>Fuck washington and nato states.

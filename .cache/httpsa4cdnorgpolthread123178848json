He doesn&#039;t know what the term &quot;globalist&quot; means. He speaks without thinking, that&#039;s his MO.<br><br>When he said &quot;I&#039;m a nationalist and a globalist&quot; he meant that he is capable of thinking both on a national and international level. Anyone with 2 braincells to rub together knows that, but the media just loves their &quot;GOTCHA&quot; moments so this will be in the news for the next week or so until trump says something else stupid.<br><br>The thing that bugs me about events like this is that there&#039;s plenty of actual things to criticize trump about without constantly being unfair and ganging up on him for the way he talks off the cuff without thinking.","time":1493375580,"resto":123178848,"id":"OY+6jJ0R","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123180958,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)06:54:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Trump isn&#039;t a cu-<\/span>","time":1493376843,"resto":123178848,"id":"zmTZrn9m","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":123181088,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)06:55:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123179177\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123179177<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;le 4d chess<\/span><br><br>He&#039;s obviously trying to pander to everyone at once, the hallmark of a insincere politician with no real principles, just letting their cape fall to whatever way the wind is blowing<br><br>I initially believed in Trump, but it turns out he&#039;s just another turncoat","time":1493376943,"resto":123178848,"id":"zmTZrn9m","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":123181278,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)06:58:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"Can we think of a certain tribe of people that are both nationalists and globalists?

It is about having a bond with your fellow countrymen, a bond that is based on your common heritage, be it linguistical, cultural, or genetic. <br><br>It is a natural part of human behaviour to organize, to form groups. And it&#039;s not always done with good intention, in fact, wicked people are the best at it (look at Jews, Free Masons, and the likes). Strong nationalism ensures that everyone within the nation belongs to a group by birtright, and it gives some degree of protection against those who would combine their efforts to subjugate others. Look at today&#039;s Western world, nationalism is all but destroyed, people are alienated from each other, and the individuals are easy prey for for those groups that seek to exploit them. This is why the globalist elite forces multiculturalism and immigration, it exactly the withering of nationalism and the alienation of people that servest their interests the best.<br><br>Tl;DR nationalism is good because it&#039;s an expression of kinship, and it helps people to resist harmful influence and exploitation by other groups or individuals. One might argue that nationalism can be replaced by other identities, such as class conciousness, but these intended replacements are always artificial, and are destined to fail, while nationalism has its roots in our most basic instincts.","time":1493131682,"resto":122739731,"id":"Hu2j9ea9","country":"HU","country_name":"Hungary"},{"no":122741307,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)10:51:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122739731\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122739731<\/a><br>nah. just swastika worshiping shit martini stirrers performing running of the bulls, but on the scale of weapons of the mass destruction.

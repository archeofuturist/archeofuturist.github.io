In 1590, during a meeting with Dutch Envoys, one Colonel Stuart at the court of James VI (as recorded by an English writer) \u201chad drawn up a certain writing, first in Scotch\u201d which he had to translate to Latin to be understood. In 1498, Don Pedro de Ayala, Spanish ambassador to James IV, remarked that Scottish and English were &quot;as different as the languages of Aragon and Castille&quot;. In 1533 in Sweden, the Scots book The Richt Way To the Kingdome of Hevine was published by reformer John Gau, translated from Danish for a Scottish audience.","time":1490793778,"resto":118781141,"id":"8EuXaqaw","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118785263,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)09:23:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118784417\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118784417<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;youre too proud to even think that people wouldnt know this nonsense about your nation. <\/span><br><br>How about you stop making stupid statements about places you know Nothing about then Fritzs.<br><br>Don&#039;t express retarded opinions and observations and then get butthurt when you&#039;re called out for it.","time":1490793812,"resto":118781141,"id":"Oq1wCdQY","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118785311,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)09:24:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118782563\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118782563<\/a><br>Hadrian&#039;s wall is deep into England you fucking mongoloid.

By focusing on them we&#039;re closely associating our movement with theirs. That association, even if we&#039;re their counterpoint, still brings us down to their level. Most moderate leftist normies are embarrassed by antifa and we shouldn&#039;t be known as one of two belligerent parties, but instead as a viable alternative ideology to the mainstream leftist narrative. We&#039;re looking as foolish as they do, like rabble-rousers most people wouldn&#039;t want to be associated with. <br><br>Fighting them in the streets is great and I applaud everyone who does so but we should frame it as being relatively easy and just a small part of what we&#039;re about. Walk right through them and crush them with your boots, don&#039;t engage them in an ideological struggle. Our struggle is against the jews, the globalists, the leftists, and pretty much everybody else in the world, not the fringe elements. Don&#039;t take your eye off the ball and get distracted by hipster fags in skinny jeans who aren&#039;t really a threat. If our movement is successful their time will come in due course.<br><br>When Richard Spencer got sucker-punched he wouldn&#039;t shut up about it for months. It made him look weak. Call the attacker a pussy, say he hits like a girl, then finish the interview like it was no big deal. Doxxing them and pressing charges is gay, street fights shouldn&#039;t be a big deal. These college tours are getting stupid too. We look like edge-lords stirring up a new controversy every week\u2014just like antifa. We should present ourselves as an ideology not a controversy.<br><br>Finally, antifa isn&#039;t going anywhere so what are we going to accomplish by focusing our efforts on them? Do you really think we&#039;re going to change their minds and they&#039;ll stop knocking over garbage cans? The ride will never end so let&#039;s not get on it in the first place. Our movement is too important. We shouldn&#039;t lower ourselves to the level of an anti-anti-fa party.","filename":"1487287567332","ext":".jpg","w":3508,"h":2480,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":176,"tim":1493868429929,"time":1493868429,"md5":"Kydb0sTkLFN0QVwYetv59g==","fsize":411323,"resto":0,"id":"mJjyBji5","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-altrights-fight-is-against-mainstream-leftist","country_name":"United States","replies":4,"images":1,"unique_ips":3},{"no":124011481,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)23:28:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124011293\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124011293<\/a><br>It&#039;s fun to watch them cry like babies when someone punches them though.","filename":"b8KcUf5","ext":".jpg","w":659,"h":539,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":102,"tim":1493868525633,"time":1493868525,"md5":"lF36I8ToP+Cl0ceKQNL9SQ==","fsize":193374,"resto":124011293,"id":"+Tivn+Tq","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124012215,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)23:34:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124011481\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124011481<\/a><br>I completely agree.

Honestly makes me appreciative of the fucking Albanians living here. They too will turn on them slowly but surely. Mark my fucking words. They don&#039;t want to subsidized these niggers when they could get a nice BMW on a leasing contract instead.<br>t. white catholic Slav","time":1491006400,"resto":119110892,"id":"Dvjynt+\/","country":"CH","country_name":"Switzerland"},{"no":119120603,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)20:26:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"Civilizations rise and fall.

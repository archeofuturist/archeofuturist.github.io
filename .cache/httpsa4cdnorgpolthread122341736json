Turns out, Swedish and German courts are VERY different from American ones and the difference pretty much explains everything.<br><br>In Swedish courts, there is no jury to decide court cases except in instances where freedom of the press is being used as a defense, or source of prosecution. In all other cases, the trials are simply decided on the whims of a Judge or a Lay-judge, who are appointed as representatives of a community. Unfortunately, those almost always happen to be local politicians who are pressured to follow a party line in their verdicts.<br><br>Germans, similarly do not use a jury system, instead using a combination of professional judges and lay-judges to reach verdicts on criminal cases. There are different tiers of courts that decide cases on severity and each tier has a different combination of lay-judges:professional judges, from lowest to highest: 2:2, 2:3, 3:5, 0:5 in that order, meaning that the higher in severity your crime is, the less say the local representatives have in your verdict.<br><br>So that&#039;s that. The Judges are products of the government and their schooling, they tend to be of higher class and don&#039;t interact with immigrants and are probably way more likely, ironically enough, to allow immigrants to repeatedly break the law because that&#039;s what the European Blue-Blood culture they come from demands. The average Germany or Swede will never be drafted on to the jury of a mudslime rape case because their governments don&#039;t hold it as a fundamental right of the common man.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;http:\/\/www.howtogermany.com\/pages\/<wbr>legal.html<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Jury<wbr>_trial#Sweden<\/span>","filename":"1489351616032","ext":".gif","w":280,"h":250,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":223,"tim":1492902077506,"time":1492902077,"md5":"1NLeBGM8W7RBqHgj\/gkA8g==","fsize":2708937,"resto":0,"id":"PIzUzLH9","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"so-a-couple-recent-news-articles-coming-out-of","country_name":"United States","replies":5,"images":0,"unique_ips":5},{"no":122342066,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)19:03:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt; to allow immigrants to repeatedly break the law because that&#039;s what the European Blue-Blood culture they come from demands<\/span><br><br>Justice is blind.

The only reason we haven&#039;t completely collapsed yet is because civilizations are impacted by past inertia.

Marriage and subordination of marriage is the only social technology that has been able to harness the cooperation of all able bodied men toward the common good.

Their baby needs to eat now. A man will however only wish for the best fit children to consume what limited food they have so the best survive. This balance of extreme dysgenics can eugenics toward the feminine has led to the death of the West.

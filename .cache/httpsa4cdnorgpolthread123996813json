Now, certainly blacks and whites do have different average environments, but it is an article of faith to assume that 100% of the difference is due to environment. And if you actually look into studies which try to control for environment, they have great difficulty equalizing racial scores. (See pic related.)

No government official or citizen is allowed inside the federal reserve bank, or at least without permission; not even the president. They profit off of printing money because they are a business, even though the more you print the more you cause inflation. The money should be in the hands of the people, not in the hands of a major corporation.

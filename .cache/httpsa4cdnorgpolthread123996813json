It is an undisputed fact that blacks have a lower IQ than whites. It might be uncomfortable to acknowledge, but it is simply true. Now, when presented with this fact, most liberals immediately jump to the belief that this difference is entirely due to environmental differences between blacks and whites. Now, certainly blacks and whites do have different average environments, but it is an article of faith to assume that 100% of the difference is due to environment. And if you actually look into studies which try to control for environment, they have great difficulty equalizing racial scores. (See pic related.) Furthermore, studies of identical and fraternal twins show that IQ is a highly heritable trait, being around 75% genetic.<br><br>I recommend reading Charles Murray&#039;s &quot;Bell Curve&quot; if you are interested.","filename":"satincome","ext":".jpg","w":638,"h":638,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493864507131,"time":1493864507,"md5":"3s81FDdhkM+HzTD3gkclPw==","fsize":140404,"resto":123996813,"id":"scF1tyTv","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124004171,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)22:25:08","name":"Christrat","com":"<a href=\"#p123996813\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123996813<\/a><br>I am a classical liberal so we are not that far apart politically.

There is no such thing as perfect liberty of which libertarians believe, and there is bound to be some instances where the government should step in to maximize the liberty of the individual<br><br>For example: The federal reserve bank controls the nations currency. No government official or citizen is allowed inside the federal reserve bank, or at least without permission; not even the president. They profit off of printing money because they are a business, even though the more you print the more you cause inflation. The money should be in the hands of the people, not in the hands of a major corporation. Therefore we, as classical liberals, believe that the Federal Reserve Bank should be abolished and money should be in the hands of the treasury in which should be elected by the people to be accountable to the people (giving the people the control of the currency). <br><br>-Like I said, this is an exception and we mostly believe in free market capitalism and very limited government, however this is an exception that libertarians as a whole disagree with; This is because Libertarians as well as their party as a whole are very business minded. Libertarians are more a party of business than a party of liberty and when it comes to certain exceptions that should be in place to protect or maximize the liberty of the individual, Libertartians do not believe in those exceptions because they believe in absolute liberty.<br>--(This is mostly why I left the Libertarian party, that and because they believe in what they believe in intellectually and not morally while classical liberals think in terms of both.)--","filename":"Profile Pic","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":386,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":80,"tim":1493864708184,"time":1493864708,"md5":"jkWP+3KF4q\/ra0Tyn7RROA==","fsize":177098,"resto":123996813,"id":"yZwoobah","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124005035,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)22:33:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124003831\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124003831<\/a><br>I wouldn&#039;t mind liberals if they were more like you.

China greenlighting North Korean regime overthrow can only happen if the USA greenlit Taiwan regime overthrow. <br><br>Yes, that&#039;s right - Trump just signed Taiwan to China on the negotiating table to be able to buy in the ability to act against North Korea, which is exactly why China is allowing it. It&#039;s a huge geopolitical mistake, but Trump wants to have it so Americans will finally respect him. It&#039;s true, they probably will - he&#039;s the president who finally manages to eliminate NK after all those years, but that is because they don&#039;t realize what&#039;s actually happening and how the US just lost its permanent carrier in the China Sea. With it, Western influence in Asia vanishes - something that hasn&#039;t happened for a few centuries so far - China becomes the absolute Asian power at last. <br><br>If China secures military dominance in the region, there is no other option but to start exerting it outwards - against the US. Which means that he just created a future rival of equal, or even higher proportions now that they&#039;re going to integrate the Taiwan economy into theirs. But that is not China alone that&#039;s becoming more powerful - it&#039;s the entire SCO, including Russia as well, which means that Russia just received a huge indirect boost to power projection through their alliance (of which China is a member of), much like the US does with NATO.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;tl;dr - stockpile canned food<\/span>","filename":"chnt-LMAP-md","ext":".png","w":965,"h":966,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491848930524,"time":1491848930,"md5":"04vq5bXGXuE8JGmBjANpww==","fsize":85357,"resto":0,"id":"uJZLmw4W","country":"BG","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"its-not-trump-whos-playing-4d-chess-its-china","country_name":"Bulgaria","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

Every time I hear about places like France or Germany it&#039;s either a terrorist attack or some depressing SJW shit. In the past you were at least richer and had nicer cities, but now your cities look worse then the worst places in Eastern Europe and you&#039;re covered with shitskins. Even if some things here still suck everything is improving and you have a genuine feeling of optimism among the population. It truly sad what you have become. Apart from some based anons from places like Texas I legitimately pity you... And to while our government is being called racist for not accepting any &#039;refugees&#039; you get enriched almost every week. <br><br>Oh well, it feels good to finally have a better standard of living then you.

Our economy was on a much lower level as a result. Still, it only took us about a quarter century to reach a decent standard of living and we actually grew almost as fast as China in that time. Most people who leave now are either scum with no skills or the few highly skilled professionals who can find much better opportunities abroad. The majority of people here lead better lives than at least in Western Europe when you adjust wages to purchasing power.

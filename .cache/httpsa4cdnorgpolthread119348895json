We have only one mandatory standardized national test and it&#039;s a series of tests at the end of high school. Other than that students have mandatory tests that are in many cases made by the teacher teaching the class \/ course all the time just like any other nation.<br>And while the gap between best performing students and worst performing students might be true, it comes at the cost of hampering the development of well performing students. We also benefit from not having students who speak 10 different languages in our classes so the teachers can actually focus on teaching rather than communication or trying to herd a pack of poorly behaving niggers.","filename":"Jo first to leave the EU Cox","ext":".jpg","w":1200,"h":1756,"tn_w":85,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491245762714,"time":1491245762,"md5":"t4KR7sXDUALeocmn3OFcWg==","fsize":276062,"resto":119348895,"id":"OKoxq9rX","country":"FI","m_img":1,"country_name":"Finland"},{"no":119364504,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)14:56:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119361624\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119361624<\/a><br>I wonder at what point exactly the Conservative party lost it soul, that it now campaigns against the very existence of, and wishes to suppress solutions to, child hunger.","filename":"1489888852125","ext":".gif","w":254,"h":196,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":96,"tim":1491245802325,"time":1491245802,"md5":"uVwNyk9FcYSOAog\/2Hu+7A==","fsize":1889429,"resto":119348895,"id":"nzA2XfVs","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119364844,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)14:59:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119355741\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119355741<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;keep telling naive children higher education is the best investment they could make<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;well golly gee I should go in debt to get a degree then<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;follow your dreams, get a liberal arts degree<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;kid gets 50k in debt for a degree that makes him qualified for Starbucks<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;kid realizes he fucked up<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;it was the capitalists that did this<\/span><br><br>Higher education is in a massive overvalued bubble right now because you retards keep pushing it as the greatest investment a person could possibly make regardless of the major.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;fuck that, we need an education bailout because it&#039;s so fucking good.

A black man. Know that even the lowliest of the blacks is greater than your greatest white prodigy. A dick numbering 12 inches or more you cannot compete and while you laugh yourself giddy in denial revel in knowing that every single day while you go to work a real man, a black man, is destroying your gf or wife in your house and on your bed and she will never tell you because she craves what you cannot offer. There is nothing you can do about it. An untamable beast of pure masculinity in comparison to you, you shrivel in cowardice behind your computer screen. Never in your sorry pathetic white-guilted life will you ever call one of us a &quot;nigger&quot; to our faces because you know that you would not escape retribution. Claim your superiority with your guns all you want white children because deep down you know that its a fall-back to mask your incompetence and insecurity over having become worthless in the eyes of those greater than you. Try as you will reality cannot and will not be prevented by the likes of you. You are the minority. We are the majority. We are lord and master - judge and jury. You will not escape the next generation you will be bred out of existence and your children just as your women will bow to us.","filename":"KILLWHITEMEN","ext":".jpg","w":300,"h":298,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":124,"tim":1491238948564,"time":1491238948,"md5":"s5kphgVR9Ch01K4Nnz0b4Q==","fsize":9825,"resto":119348895,"id":"zSxavhGb","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119350499,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)13:06:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119349572\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119349572<\/a><br>Because you can&#039;t become an expert laborer without also learning critical thinking.

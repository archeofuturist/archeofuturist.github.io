I&#039;m very disillusioned at the moment. For all that right-wingers kick up a fuss about leftist bullshit, there&#039;s no actual way to stop their values from sinking in. The female vote was once an outrageous concept, and conservatives 100+ years ago resisted and complained about it. In spite of this, it is considered as normal now as a man&#039;s right to vote was in the early 1900s. The same thing is happening again with the acceptance of transfags. People aren&#039;t fully convinced yet, but the idea that gender can be decided by the individual will be as normal in the year 2120 as our conception of biologically determined gender is now. The point I&#039;m trying to make isn&#039;t about transgenderism in particular, though. I&#039;m just using it as an example to illustrate the inevitability of left-wing ideas rooting themselves into society.<br><br>The conservative mindset operates under the false assumption that the two sides have an equal chance of winning \u2013 that, by resisting lefty bollocks, you can keep tradition intact. But, in reality, it amounts to nothing more than a delaying tactic. Once a libshit idea enters mainstream consciousness, the battle is already lost. The best conservatives can do is slow down the rate at which it is accepted by the populace, but its eventual acceptance is inevitable at that point.<br><br>If you look back on history, our overall movement has been towards the left rather than the right.","filename":"8fjd52bf","ext":".jpg","w":745,"h":1119,"tn_w":166,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490185111120,"time":1490185111,"md5":"XgroyT4VetXH9kz8t1hwOw==","fsize":117914,"resto":0,"id":"A6ARSFPJ","country":"GB","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"how-do-you-deal-with-the-fact-that-youre","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":76,"images":19,"unique_ips":59},{"no":117752934,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)08:24:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"i&#039;m resigned to the fact that i&#039;m doomed to live in an era of decay and disintegration.

If you want to stabilize your movement and not lose it on the next pendulum swing, you can&#039;t focus too much on telling people &quot;muh degeneracy, you can&#039;t do this and you can&#039;t do that&quot;. People generally don&#039;t like being told what to do, especially young people (this might be a main reason why generation z seems to be the most conservative since ww2 at the moment). It&#039;s suicide to have this extreme moralism where you can&#039;t accept people who support you on all fronts, except they&#039;re gay, anti-kids, pro-abortion or apathetic on race or something.","time":1490198614,"resto":117752508,"id":"M4WegQdq","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":117780655,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)12:07:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117752508\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117752508<\/a><br>The problem with liberals is that they think history started in 1914.<br><br>Society became more and less degenerate plenty of times.

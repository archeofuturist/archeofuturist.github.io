He is bilingual at the age of 11; knowing Slovenian and English (two languages NOT RELATED AT ALL) and from what Trump tells us, he loves Chess (again, at the age of 11) and Computers (Programming?). This provides evidence of extreme intellect. He probably has some form of very mild autism. He will most likely end up in politics or starting his own tech firm\/Venture Capital firm.<\/span>","time":1491200688,"resto":119295832,"id":"RLyfQKWd","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119299752,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)02:26:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119298266\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119298266<\/a><br>Yeah, you just shit on the street.","time":1491200778,"resto":119295832,"id":"++F24WcR","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"}]}

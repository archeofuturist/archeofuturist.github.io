That&#039;s way too much overhead. And some don&#039;t ever get to that point. But those are still legitimate companies where the employer\/entrepreneur knows a shit ton about all facets of running a company.<br><br>I just hate this meme that some fatcat who does nothing is dumber than the underlings he hires. This is generally stated by underlings who have no knowledge of the company&#039;s history, or their boss, who probably spent years of hard work doing tbeir job and others to get the company to a point where he could hire ungrateful employees.<br><br>And this type of thing is common. Look at trump. A self made man with a private company he built, and you still see people treating him like a dummy.<br><br>Until you set off and do things on your own, you have no right to judge those who have.

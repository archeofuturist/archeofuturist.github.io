That&#039;s way too much overhead. And some don&#039;t ever get to that point. But those are still legitimate companies where the employer\/entrepreneur knows a shit ton about all facets of running a company.<br><br>I just hate this meme that some fatcat who does nothing is dumber than the underlings he hires. This is generally stated by underlings who have no knowledge of the company&#039;s history, or their boss, who probably spent years of hard work doing tbeir job and others to get the company to a point where he could hire ungrateful employees.<br><br>And this type of thing is common. Look at trump. A self made man with a private company he built, and you still see people treating him like a dummy.<br><br>Until you set off and do things on your own, you have no right to judge those who have. It takes an extraordinary work ethic and varied set of skills to run a business.","time":1490847476,"resto":118868835,"id":"PsYodGj0","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118881497,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)00:18:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118868835\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118868835<\/a><br>As long as their duties get done, why do you give a fuck?

There was a sworn jury, a real judge, actual witness examination and cross-examination, physical and photographic evidence. The prosecuting attorney and the defense attorney were two of the most accomplished trial lawyers of 20th century America. As a lay person, that is, not someone really close to the evidence of the case, I found it extremely interesting and informative. Both sides of the trial gave the strongest case I&#039;ve ever heard for their respective points.<br><br>So my question is: Why has this never been done for Adolf Hitler? As a non-historian, I can see a good case to be made both for and against Hitler on the charge of &quot;crimes against humanity&quot; and I&#039;d love to see 2 really skilled lawyers give him the sort of treatment Oswald got.","filename":"jfk","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":576,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1492779134789,"time":1492779134,"md5":"wJiAkgroHEij4JXd3oJGeQ==","fsize":108483,"resto":0,"id":"xdML4IMW","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"i-recently-saw-a-great-program-called-on-trial","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":122132335,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)08:53:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122132226\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122132226<\/a><br>because hitler is racist and the devil and also had a micropenis and one testicle","time":1492779219,"resto":122132226,"id":"QhrM4IhY","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122132484,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)08:55:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122132335\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122132335<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;sees flag<\/span><br>And they say stereotypes aren&#039;t true","time":1492779321,"resto":122132226,"id":"xdML4IMW","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

Bugs Bunny is a rabbit, and while he is anthropomorphic, the suspension of disbelief only stretches so far for some people. It might not be a widely held understanding for white people, so immediately after talking to my friend about Bugs Bunny being black, I turned to my (admittedly, mostly white) colleagues and asked around.<br><br>&quot;Do you think Bugs Bunny is black?&quot; I asked, only for many to not really understand the question. &quot;Is this a trick?&quot; one suspicious white man asked. &quot;No.&quot; I responded, &quot;It&#039;s a very simple yes or no question.&quot;<br><br>After many conversations that involved white people trying very hard to not to say the wrong thing, someone finally askedhowI knew\u2014a question I couldn&#039;t really answer.I just knew.Once I explained my vague reasoning (he just is), some understood but I left most of these interactions realizing it wasn&#039;t so simple.<br><br>There&#039;s no doubt in my mind Bugs Bunny is a black man. To me, it&#039;s as obvious as anything I&#039;ve always known. The sky? Blue. Grass? Green. Bugs Bunny? Very black. It doesn&#039;t end with Bugs Bunny, either. While Bugs is arguably one of the most widely recognizable cartoon characters of all time, I&#039;ve known in my heart that many other anthropomorphic characters are black.","time":1493427833,"resto":123274201,"id":"Z6QZDm\/b","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123274495,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)21:05:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123274201\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123274201<\/a><br>&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;Journalism&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;","time":1493427911,"resto":123274201,"id":"\/EGRspOl","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123274662,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)21:06:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"dumbest shit I&#039;ve read all day","time":1493428004,"resto":123274201,"id":"nEHUtMuW","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123274668,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)21:06:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123274201\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123274201<\/a><br>Why would a black wabbit wear blackface?","filename":"Anybondstodaybugsblackface_1_","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":450,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1493428006003,"time":1493428006,"md5":"TR8x\/sqXkHsmQZxmTfDlrA==","fsize":25219,"resto":123274201,"id":"JBVgC2aX","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123274682,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)21:06:54","name":"fRE","com":"Most of these are animals\/non-humans so how could they be any race?","time":1493428014,"resto":123274201,"id":"6r+DvDR9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123274756,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)21:07:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"Not gonna lie I always (personally speaking) considered Piccolo a nigger.","time":1493428049,"resto":123274201,"id":"7HcecZAy","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123274776,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)21:07:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"Who the fuck would try to claim Scrappy Doo?","time":1493428061,"resto":123274201,"id":"r1iEKHFW","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123274816,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)21:07:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"those are all animals <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;sounds about right<\/span>","time":1493428074,"resto":123274201,"id":"bwfBWIXv","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123274933,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)21:08:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123274201\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123274201<\/a><br>what the fuck?

I somehow always knew but it never bothered me, because it didn&#039;t prime it&#039;s identical trait on being genderless. The problem with gender is that retards let it define them and post-handed jump to the assumption that you are offended by it, so they press it harder. The issue with gender benders and tranies is not the gender, but the choice of identity and group-think-ideology. Same goes for blacks I guess. I don&#039;t hate blacks for being black, I hate them if they let an insignificant thing as being black define them. Bugs Bunny never obseesed about being black, ergo I like Bugs bunny.","filename":"IMG_0998","ext":".png","w":640,"h":1136,"tn_w":70,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493430916509,"time":1493430916,"md5":"zn9+zQ4LQo6i7fudDhEVCA==","fsize":1054924,"resto":123274201,"id":"\/vVfOEfl","country":"DK","m_img":1,"country_name":"Denmark"},{"no":123280218,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)21:55:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123274321\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123274321<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;vice<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;samefagging<\/span><br>Bugs bunny is based on graucho marx, so he&#039;s Jewish if anything.

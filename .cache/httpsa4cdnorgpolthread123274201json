Bugs Bunny is a rabbit, and while he is anthropomorphic, the suspension of disbelief only stretches so far for some people. It might not be a widely held understanding for white people, so immediately after talking to my friend about Bugs Bunny being black, I turned to my (admittedly, mostly white) colleagues and asked around.<br><br>&quot;Do you think Bugs Bunny is black?&quot; I asked, only for many to not really understand the question. &quot;Is this a trick?&quot; one suspicious white man asked. &quot;No.&quot; I responded, &quot;It&#039;s a very simple yes or no question.&quot;<br><br>After many conversations that involved white people trying very hard to not to say the wrong thing, someone finally askedhowI knew\u2014a question I couldn&#039;t really answer.I just knew.Once I explained my vague reasoning (he just is), some understood but I left most of these interactions realizing it wasn&#039;t so simple.<br><br>There&#039;s no doubt in my mind Bugs Bunny is a black man. To me, it&#039;s as obvious as anything I&#039;ve always known. The sky? Blue. Grass? Green. Bugs Bunny? Very black. It doesn&#039;t end with Bugs Bunny, either. While Bugs is arguably one of the most widely recognizable cartoon characters of all time, I&#039;ve known in my heart that many other anthropomorphic characters are black.","time":1493427833,"resto":123274201,"id":"Z6QZDm\/b","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123274495,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)21:05:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123274201\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123274201<\/a><br>&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;Journalism&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;","time":1493427911,"resto":123274201,"id":"\/EGRspOl","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123274662,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)21:06:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"dumbest shit I&#039;ve read all day","time":1493428004,"resto":123274201,"id":"nEHUtMuW","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123274668,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)21:06:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123274201\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123274201<\/a><br>Why would a black wabbit wear blackface?","filename":"Anybondstodaybugsblackface_1_","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":450,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1493428006003,"time":1493428006,"md5":"TR8x\/sqXkHsmQZxmTfDlrA==","fsize":25219,"resto":123274201,"id":"JBVgC2aX","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123274682,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)21:06:54","name":"fRE","com":"Most of these are animals\/non-humans so how could they be any race?","time":1493428014,"resto":123274201,"id":"6r+DvDR9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123274756,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)21:07:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"Not gonna lie I always (personally speaking) considered Piccolo a nigger.","time":1493428049,"resto":123274201,"id":"7HcecZAy","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123274776,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)21:07:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"Who the fuck would try to claim Scrappy Doo?","time":1493428061,"resto":123274201,"id":"r1iEKHFW","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123274816,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)21:07:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"those are all animals <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;sounds about right<\/span>","time":1493428074,"resto":123274201,"id":"bwfBWIXv","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123274933,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)21:08:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123274201\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123274201<\/a><br>what the fuck?

The issue with gender benders and tranies is not the gender, but the choice of identity and group-think-ideology. Same goes for blacks I guess.

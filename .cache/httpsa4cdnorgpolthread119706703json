The Naturalization Act of 1870 extended &quot;the naturalization laws&quot; to &quot;aliens of African nativity and to persons of African descent.&quot; In 1898 the Supreme Court decision in United States v. Wong Kim Ark granted citizenship to an American-born child of Chinese parents who had a permanent domicil and residence in the United States, and who were there carrying on business, and are not employed in any diplomatic or official capacity under the Emperor of China.[4] All persons born in the United States since United States v. Wong Kim Ark have been granted citizenship although the Supreme Court has never explicitly ruled on the matter of children born to parents who are not legal residents of the United States.","time":1491461287,"resto":119706703,"id":"cRq1hio4","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119715872,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)02:48:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119715749\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119715749<\/a><br>isnt weird how the FBI reported that the murder rate in the country has actually been on a steady decline nationally?","time":1491461339,"resto":119706703,"id":"cRq1hio4","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119715889,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)02:49:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119715823\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119715823<\/a><br><br>Yeah, no shit.

One team armed with riches, the other with nothing but a keyboard and each other. It&#039;s the ultimate, international-scale CTF, where the theme is Money Vs. Man. Shia&#039;s whole motivation was people staying together - no one can divide them.<br><br>He&#039;s doing it. I&#039;ve rarely ever seen us working so well together over anything, and the obsession with taking down the HWNDU flag is one such anomaly. You guys found the location of a flag based on the view of the fucking sky! You banded together and worked as a unit of people to take that flag down, and by god did you do it. The flag in Liverpool? You worked together ACROSS THE SEA to find and take the flag down. Both times you won the battle, but Shia is winning the war.<br><br>By working together to take down the flags he puts up, he is proving that he will not divide us. Shia&#039;s not smart enough to have planned the events like this, but it&#039;s working in his favor anyway. And ours too! I have yet to see something more entertaining than watching a bunch of NEETS work together for a common goal, and it&#039;s fun as hell.<br><br>I really hope Shia continues this campaign. One man armed with millions of dollars vs a network of jobless hermits who live with their parents, and each time the flag goes up, teamwork takes it down.<br><br>You should be proud of yourselves. Everyone, Shia included. The next 3 and a half years - maybe 8 - are gonna be packed-full of world championship CTF wars, and it&#039;s gonna be a fucking blast.<br><br>Godspeed you glorious bastards.","filename":"liverpool","ext":".jpg","w":2000,"h":1000,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490754325879,"time":1490754325,"md5":"rz4M3hvfbyuTZ6VD2O9sGw==","fsize":309761,"resto":0,"id":"QSzwyf8Y","country":"CA","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"hwndu-is-sort-of-working","country_name":"Canada","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

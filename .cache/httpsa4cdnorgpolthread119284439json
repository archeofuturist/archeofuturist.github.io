You should look into National Socialism, or Nazism. It isn&#039;t marxian socialism by the way, it&#039;s a form of prussian socialism that believes in private property and individuality. It&#039;s economics are for domestic productionism, which means that it supports small family owned domestic businesses more than anything else, although National Socialism is a philosophy more than anything and could be applied to nearly any economic doctrine, such as fascism, or even libertarianism.

The goals of Nazi Germany and the USSR were unfortunately similar until Operation Barbarossa. Stalin actually had to be informed several times that the Germans were attacking, he didn&#039;t believe it.","filename":"t. stephen hicks","ext":".jpg","w":375,"h":500,"tn_w":93,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491190807178,"time":1491190807,"md5":"Wyd2ubQQhDu+bsmOxQZHEw==","fsize":71927,"resto":119284439,"id":"g9L0G7tg","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

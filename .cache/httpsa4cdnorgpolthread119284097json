They can&#039;t &quot;become a woman&quot; because they haven&#039;t grown a dick. Remember Gordon Jahans the fat fuck with zero testosterone and a micropenis? From him we learned that this process can&#039;t just be started later. He&#039;ll always have a literal baby dick.<br><br>Which means these trannies can&#039;t even &quot;go back&quot; to being male. Trans advocates and hormone blocking has fucked up their chance to be any gender.<br><br>I&#039;m actually amazed this has never come up in the perpetual tranny debate here on \/pol\/ so I thought it would activate some almonds.","filename":"Jazz_0","ext":".jpg","w":750,"h":563,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1491189598815,"time":1491189598,"md5":"WNywakfc4RVjVsUTmAsGcQ==","fsize":92055,"resto":0,"id":"eB3H+mHt","country":"SG","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"remember-jazz-the-tranny-kid-with-a-tv-show","country_name":"Singapore","replies":9,"images":3,"unique_ips":10},{"no":119284511,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)23:24:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"People who support allowing children to be trans unironically deserve to be gassed","time":1491189869,"resto":119284097,"id":"zBqE4cCS","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119284574,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)23:25:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"They are also at greater risk of stroke and heart attack.

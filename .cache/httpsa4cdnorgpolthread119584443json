Seriously, all you guys do is cry about how fucked up everything is. You have no idea how much easier EVERYTHING is. How could you? You never even had to walk someplace to get to a telephone. I see you fuckers all high and mighty talking about how it&#039;s &quot;current year&quot; and yet you still have to do things you don&#039;t want to do. Technology\/societal evolution has not saved you from having to endure shit that is not interesting or fun. WELCOME TO ADULTHOOD!!! Jesus fucking Christ who put these expectations into your fucking heads? Grow the fuck up already; life is mostly pain (or at least not euphoria) with breaks of non pain and short (occasional) periods of actual joy. That&#039;s it. You will not find some Hollywood hype-train of eternal awesome that you somehow believe you are entitled to by birthright. <br><br>You guys are talented and resilient and smart.

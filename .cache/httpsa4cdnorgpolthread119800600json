Both are wrong, and right on a number of issues. It makes no difference if the parties cannot work together and just gridlock each other like we have been seeing for decades.","time":1491518082,"resto":119800600,"id":"KDYt3+uD","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119807607,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)18:36:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119800600\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119800600<\/a><br>I wish the &#039;Reagan Conservativism&#039; meme would die already.

With social issues such as gays and trans the left do not want govt telling them what to do. They feel entitled to do whatever they want without any restrictions. If they want to get married to a horse they should be allowed. They want to shower anywhere they want and no one can say no. But tell them that a bakery doesn&#039;t want to bake a cake for them and they lose their shit. They want govt hands off the social freedoms but expect the govt to be hands on the economic issues (although i acknowledge that gay wedding cakes could be seen as both an economic and social issue).

Then they started saying the grenades were training ones, and the explosive wasn&#039;t a functionnal one. Then they admitted he had an airsoft revolver, which was pretty obvious as it was portrayed in one of his video with the clown mask. Now we all know he only had a break barrel air rifle, which he used for the &quot;shooting&quot;, and that airsoft revolver. Everything else is pure lies from the fake news. Yet our great politicians were like &quot;hurr he was fascinated by weapons of war&quot; (the great keyword of French antiguns : weapons of war, whatever that means, it sounds scary so it&#039;s good enough), then everyone was like &quot;how did he enter school with guns? Where did he find guns?&quot; as if all of that shit was remotely real.

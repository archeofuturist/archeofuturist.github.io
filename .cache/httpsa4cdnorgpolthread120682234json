So the next best thing is fake war. Something like pro wrestling. Sure it will look similar to real thing, only with more &quot;flair&quot; and &quot;glitter&quot;. Notice those muscular WWF warriors with equally muscular tongues are very careful not to injure each other? It&#039;s the same with modern &quot;you&#039;re with us or against us&quot; warfare. Rainbows just use it to target and cull straight people in the enemy territory and among their own ranks. Thats is the only reason why they were able to abolish DADT. They had to take out americans out of america and process them by using individually catered pogroms, fragging, IED&#039;s, bullying, hazing, sexual assaults, etc etc..","time":1491956592,"resto":120682234,"id":"3NxhmQ6b","country":"LT","country_name":"Lithuania"},{"no":120684492,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)20:26:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120682234\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120682234<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;they hacked our election<\/span><br>they didn&#039;t, and even if they did, USA does it all the time too so deal with it<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;they support the brutal dictator assad<\/span><br>nice shill jew<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;they threaten american global hegemony<\/span><br>good, it helps balancing powers<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;putin is an authoritarian dictator<\/span><br>and?<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;20% muslim<\/span><br>Have you noticed how big is the Russian Federation?<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;birthplace of leninism<\/span><br>And America is the vehicle by which Satan enters the world.<br>Jews used Russia in 1917 now they&#039;re using the USA.

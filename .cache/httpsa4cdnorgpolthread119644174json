You cannot play 4D chess with us. We are not Facebook, Reddit, Tumblr, Youtube comment section or any other chatroom or forum you&#039;ve ever met in your ENTIRE life.<br><br>I sound dramatic, right? What you didn&#039;t know is that in any other place, the harder you to troll, the more you will make the place implode and collapse upon itself in a bitter argument. BUT THIS IS NOT LIKE ANY OTHER PLACE! The harder you shill, divide, and bait us, the bigger we grow. We love chaos, we love happenings, we want to see the world collapse under its weight. You think you are extinguishing us with water, not realizing your bucket is full of gasoline.<br><br>You will come to break \/pol\/, but while you are doing this, we are breaking you. We are destroying everything you ever believed in. While you think you are just being ironic, we will mold and shape you to start believing everything that we want you to believe. Do you think that only crazy people believe that the holocaust didn&#039;t happen? Wow, start arguing anytime. Spend time, try to convince us. Spend days, weeks, months. The harder you try, the faster you will be destroyed by mountains of evidence, countless arguments, veiwpoints, and perspectives. The sheer force of our numbers will break you. Once you are completely drained of energy, we will plant seeds of new veiwpoints in your mind. Very soon, you will turn to watch The Greatest Story Never Told, and become one of us. You will join our numbers and break somebody newer than you, believing what you used to believe. You have entered hell, and you have came to serve the demons you were fighting before.<br><br>This is 4chan. Welcome to \/pol\/, nigger.","filename":"1490598679214","ext":".png","w":1000,"h":821,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":205,"tim":1491420468802,"time":1491420468,"md5":"QcerKAd3QMAQ9YSV+oS1Kg==","fsize":1243892,"resto":0,"id":"hXfdAiQ\/","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"you-think-you-are-so-smug-coming-here-from","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":119644312,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)15:28:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119644174\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119644174<\/a><br>real edgy man.

They are NOT spiritual beings, a better term would be psychic, as they come from the intermediate levels which separate material reality from pure spirituality. Ancients called some of these intermediate levels &quot;Hell&quot; or &quot;the seven Hells&quot; and so forth. <br><br>There is a &quot;Great Wall&quot; which divides material reality from these intermediate strata. It&#039;s referenced in diverse traditional myths, particularly those which refer to Gog and Magog (and the Sanskrit counterparts, though I forget the terminology). End time propechies indicate that holes in the Great Wall, or tears in the veil, will become more and more common at the end of our present cycle, until finally a fissure in the wall will appear which is large enough to allow an &quot;invasion&quot; - this is the &quot;hordes of Gog and Magog&quot; of the Hebrew Bible. <br><br>These fissures in the Great Wall have occurred with some regularity ever since the beginning of the Kali Yuga, some six thousand years ago, roughly. The ancient Chinese myth which recounts how a legendary king and sorcerer was able to repair one of these holes is pertinent. Initiative centers worldwide traditionally were charged with the maintenance of the Great Wall. The advent of the modern world has lead to the breakdown of all initiatic centers, unless there still exist some in secret which have gone underground.

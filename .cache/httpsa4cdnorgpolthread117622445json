They are NOT spiritual beings, a better term would be psychic, as they come from the intermediate levels which separate material reality from pure spirituality. Ancients called some of these intermediate levels &quot;Hell&quot; or &quot;the seven Hells&quot; and so forth. <br><br>There is a &quot;Great Wall&quot; which divides material reality from these intermediate strata. It&#039;s referenced in diverse traditional myths, particularly those which refer to Gog and Magog (and the Sanskrit counterparts, though I forget the terminology). End time propechies indicate that holes in the Great Wall, or tears in the veil, will become more and more common at the end of our present cycle, until finally a fissure in the wall will appear which is large enough to allow an &quot;invasion&quot; - this is the &quot;hordes of Gog and Magog&quot; of the Hebrew Bible. <br><br>These fissures in the Great Wall have occurred with some regularity ever since the beginning of the Kali Yuga, some six thousand years ago, roughly. The ancient Chinese myth which recounts how a legendary king and sorcerer was able to repair one of these holes is pertinent. Initiative centers worldwide traditionally were charged with the maintenance of the Great Wall. The advent of the modern world has lead to the breakdown of all initiatic centers, unless there still exist some in secret which have gone underground.

In Idaho, for example, a 2-million-year-old clay figurine was unearthed in 1912. But even this discovery does not mark an outer limit. Bones, vertebrae and even complete skeletons have been found in Italy, Argentina and Kenya. Their minimum datings range from 3 million to 4 million years. A human skull, a partial human skeleton and a collection of neoliths discovered in California have been dated in excess of 5 million years. A human skeleton discovered at Midi in France, paleoliths found in Portugal, Burma and Argentina, a carved bone and flint flakes from Turkey all have a minimum age of 5 million years.<br>How far back can human history be pushed with discoveries like these? The answer seems to be a great deal further than orthodox science currently allows.

Dinosaurs have been extinct for approximately 65 million years.<br>In 1983, Professor W. G. Burroughs of Kentucky reported the discovery of three pairs of fossil tracks dated to 300 million years ago. They showed left and right footprints. Each print had five toes and a distinct arch. The toes were spread apart like those of a human used to walking barefoot. The foot curved back like a human foot to what appeared to be a human heel. There was a pair of prints in the series that showed a left and right foot. The distance between them is just what you&#039;d expect in modern human footprints.<br>In December 1862, The Geologist carried news of a human skeleton found 27.5 m (90 ft) below the surface in a coal seam in Illinois.

At least I didn&#039;t vote for drumft! <br><br>I consider myself a feminist. I dont believe in enforced gender roles; they may happen naturally, but they should never be coerced into happening unnaturally. As in, the societal pressure for gender roles should really go, even if it&#039;ll turn out that the majority of relationships continue operating the same way of their own accord. I treat women with the same outlook I treat men, and never participate in the old Reddit &quot;women are crazy&quot; circlejerk, because there are multiple women out there and each have different personalities just like there are multiple men out there and each with different personalities. I don&#039;t think you do much of anything except scare off the awesome women out there by going on and on about the ones who aren&#039;t awesome. That doesnt mean I look for places to victimize women, I just dont believe it&#039;s fair to make generalizations such as the one about women acting like everything&#039;s OK when it&#039;s really not (and that&#039;s a particularly harsh example, because all humans do that). I&#039;m kind of tired of citing these examples and I&#039;m guessing you&#039;re getting tired of reading them, if you&#039;ve even made it this far. In closing, the people who know me in real life all respect me, as do a great many people in the Reddit brony community, where I spend most of my time and where I&#039;m pretty known for being helpful around the community. A lot of people in my segment of the community are depressed or going through hard times, and I spend a lot of time giving advices.<br><br>But seriously, we can&#039;t let him get the nuclear codes.","filename":"Crew_sample009PortugalPROXY1","ext":".jpg","w":1620,"h":599,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":46,"tim":1493723081493,"time":1493723081,"md5":"E7zyv46vR1TJgqHZj4VIZA==","fsize":229569,"resto":123754503,"id":"zwtzJthS","country":"PT","m_img":1,"country_name":"Portugal"},{"no":123758629,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)07:40:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123754503\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123754503<\/a><br>Here you go Alberto, yours is the least intelligent post of the day!

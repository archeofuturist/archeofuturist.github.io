Thought Id let you know that the reason the shadow brokers have fucked up &quot;foreign&quot; sounding grammar is not because their russians you idiot. Its a countermeasure against stylometric identification. If they are NSA insiders then the problem is everyone has a very unique writing style whether you know it or not and their are tools that are somewhat available where you can compare writing samples to find out who authored the post.<br><br>Just thought you like to know and spread the word Im sick of hearing how &quot;dur they must be chinese russian agents&quot; if they were inteligent enough to get the password to NSA tools why would they be dumb enough to speak in obviously broken english outing themselves?

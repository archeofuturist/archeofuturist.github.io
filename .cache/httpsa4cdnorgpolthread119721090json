They refuse to stop protesting until her entire political party is criminalized and she has to step down to go to jail. Lets say that simultaneously armed insurgents (I will keep religion out of this, as Im trying to offer a logical, reason-based question) suddenly take over Manchester and Brimingham, terrorizing the local populace with car bombs and suicide bombings before they attack all the police stations and execute every policeman. Also, lets assume these insurgents have been armed and trained secretly by Germany and Turkey (just naming random foreign powers) for years.In addition, a large proportion of the British Armed Forces in these cities and other whole governates under rebel control mutiny and decide to join the insurgents against the government in a power grab. Throughout all this, the rebels are executing everyone who differs from them in their viewpoints, and are setting up arbitrary security rules in areas under their control. Lets say this situation lasts for 8 months, and every major and strategic city in England has fallen in rebel hands, and the rebels now surround London, and even within London itself there are districts where the government is fighting desperately against rebel forces who surprise attack them every few weeks.<br><br><br>How would the UK government react to all this?

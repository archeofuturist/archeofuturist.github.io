With men you might run into some trouble if you are brutally honest all the time, but I have found that women tolerate it better, even if they find it unpleasant at first. One of the most unattractive qualities to women are when men are uncertain or indecisive. For example, when they ask something and you don&#039;t know, immediately tell you don&#039;t know, don&#039;t pretend that you &quot;might know&quot;. Lots of numales for example fail at this, they let women fool them into doing things against their will or interests, and later sperg out on &quot;how women are evil&quot; while it&#039;s their fault for not making themselves clear right away. Also, there is a difference between being playfully mysterious and indecisive, difference being that you either are aware of the impression you want to make, and for what reason, or you are not.<br><br>Sorry for a long post<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;tl;dr social dynamics is important, redpill yourself on male and female nature if you can<\/span>","filename":"1489900271846","ext":".jpg","w":195,"h":259,"tn_w":94,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493147443041,"time":1493147443,"md5":"VBkh7Sgd6IqBhsCikz9OpQ==","fsize":7387,"resto":122769598,"id":"Z4vbhNU9","country":"EE","country_name":"Estonia"},{"no":122772012,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)15:10:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"The redpill here is about rich jewish bankers ruling the world and enslaving mankind.

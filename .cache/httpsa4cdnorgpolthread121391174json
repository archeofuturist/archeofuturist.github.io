Cletus High School means you should make bank without putting in effort to acquire skills, then you deserve to be poor.<br><br>Im not deluded enough to think everyone can become a millionaire if they try hard enough, but you sure as hell can become upper middle class if you put in the effort. Jesus, you don&#039;t even need to go to college, learn a trade.

It isn&#039;t favoritism it&#039;s that nobody wants to give someone a chance or train them.

There is a very real danger of this right wing counter movement falling apart because the disparate ideologies forming the coalition aren&#039;t staying focused on their all-important common goals (e.g. securing national sovereignty through controlled immigration and wresting the political machinery away from globalists.) Look at Europe right now, with their multi-party Parliaments; left-wing coalitions and status quo centrists\/cuckservatives all will form coalitions to prevent populist, nativist parties out of power. SD, AfD, Wilder&#039;s Party, Front National. And the people of Europe are still asleep despite homegrown Muslim terrorists mass murdering them in their own countries: running them down in their streets, shooting them at cultural events, stabbing them outside their very seats of government. Our movement here in the US needs to coalesce and compromise so very badly, but I see libertarians pontificating about how they&#039;re different than AnCaps, Civic and Ethnic Nationalists building walls between one another, National Socialists constantly baited by controlled opposition LARPing as Nazis, quibbles over Protestant vs. Catholicism, on and on and on.

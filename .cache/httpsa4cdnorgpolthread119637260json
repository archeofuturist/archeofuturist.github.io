The majority of countries exhibit hate speech in between 8% and 12% of their posts, however. We also see elevated uses of hate speech in certain European countries (e.g., Italy, Spain, Greece, and France) that possibly also has to do with the current immigration crisis. Finally, we note that the Anglosphere countries are generally close to each other with respect to hate speech usage: on the low end we see just over 9% in the UK and on the high end, a bit over 11% for Australia and South Africa.<\/span>","time":1491417779,"resto":119637260,"id":"Cv8Ku2wh","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"}]}

(All the women saw the same photo, as did all the men.) Half of the subjects were told that their match was already romantically involved with someone else, while the other half were told that their match was unattached. Then the subjects were all asked how interested they were in their match.<br><br>To the men in the experiment, and to the women who were already in relationships, it didn\u2019t make a significant difference whether their match was single or attached. But single women showed a distinct preference for mate poaching. When the man was described as unattached, 59 percent of the single women were interested in pursuing him. When that same man was described as being in a committed relationship, 90 percent were interested. The researchers write:<br><br>&#039;According to a recent poll, most women who engage in mate poaching do not think the attached status of the target played a role in their poaching decision, but our study shows this belief to be false. Single women in this study were significantly more interested in the target when he was attached. This may be because an attached man has demonstrated his ability to commit and in some ways his qualities have already been \u2018\u2018pre-screened\u201d by another woman.&#039;&quot;","time":1493834267,"resto":123937200,"id":"NAbXLWE2","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123939475,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)13:59:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123937200\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123937200<\/a><br>Most of them are picky so are men","time":1493834382,"resto":123937200,"id":"5utdeGg0","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123939581,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)14:00:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123937200\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123937200<\/a><br>Fapping to the purest waifus.","time":1493834437,"resto":123937200,"id":"9lUlaZgK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123940097,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)14:05:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123939259\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123939259<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;too much to read<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;read it though because bored at work<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;top kek<\/span>","time":1493834716,"resto":123937200,"id":"xI1gzS3R","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123940556,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)14:09:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123940097\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123940097<\/a><br>80\/20 rule famalam.","time":1493834956,"resto":123937200,"id":"LhA9UtgS","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123941188,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)14:14:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"why do i see this posted daily on pol?","time":1493835286,"resto":123937200,"id":"TmKdhgLS","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123941583,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)14:18:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123941188\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123941188<\/a><br>Because it fun seeing whores die out.

Sperm replenishes but each time it does there&#039;s a higher chance for some of its genetic material to degrade - this cycling and degradation happens more frequently than with a woman&#039;s eggs. A man in his 50s or 60s is significantly more likely to have a child with autism or other brain defects (clinical depression, bipolar, etc) compared to if the mother who bears the child is in her 50s. The risk can be reduced if one parent is much younger than the other - so if either mom or dad is up in age but the other is say a decade younger they&#039;re more likely to have a healthy kid than if both mom and dad are in their 50s-60s.","time":1493839180,"resto":123937200,"id":"mltisHaA","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123949185,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)15:21:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123948869\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123948869<\/a><br>I&#039;m sure it has nothing to do with the genetically unfit propagating while people who should be aren&#039;t.","time":1493839278,"resto":123937200,"id":"LhA9UtgS","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123949260,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)15:21:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123943003\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123943003<\/a><br><br>And now weaponized autism is going to avenge it&#039;s own existence.","filename":"1483529751453","ext":".jpg","w":760,"h":337,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":55,"tim":1493839317017,"time":1493839317,"md5":"b8CghV8SymtjSdTQiK0gXQ==","fsize":39361,"resto":123937200,"id":"6dq4OYzU","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123950154,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)15:28:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123937200\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123937200<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;ur a dog<\/span><br>How are you going to get mah dick in yo mouth with that attitude gurl?","time":1493839727,"resto":123937200,"id":"VnkR4AjX","country":"RO","country_name":"Romania"},{"no":123951048,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)15:35:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123939259\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123939259<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Women say &quot;why are all the chads taken?&quot;<\/span><br>Aww they say uhh..<br>.. a black man is a pimp<br>Well let me tell you the biggest pimp<br>on planet motherfuckin Earth, is her momma<br>It&#039;s her MOMMA that told her,<br>&quot;Get a man that got a good job gurl!<br>Make sure he got a good car gurl!<br>Make sure he can take you out and buy you somethin gurl!&quot;<br>What happened to just fallin in love with a nigga with a bus pass --<br>-- just cause you love the nigga?<br>But +I&#039;m+ the pimp motherfucker!<br>I gotta be the player!<br><br>Biggest hoes, on planet Earth..<br>.. are walkin through the motherfuckin neighborhood<br>You KNEW when you got with the nigga he already had a woman<br>You knew he already had a family<br>but you fucked him anyway!!!<br>And then when you thought you gon&#039; lose the nigga<br>you went and got pregant - didn&#039;t you bitch, DIDN&#039;T YOU!!<br>THE OL&#039; KEEP A NIGGA BABY<br>And then when the nigga ain&#039;t around, what do you tell the child?<br>&quot;Aww that nigga ain&#039;t shit, that&#039;s why yo&#039; daddy ain&#039;t here;<br>cause that nigga ain&#039;t shit.&quot;<br>How bout bein a woman, and tellin the kid the truth<br>that yo&#039; momma, you was a hoe!<br>TELL THE KID!<br>Momma was a hoe, I was weekend pussy<br>I had you to keep the nigga, it didn&#039;t work out<br>that&#039;s why he ain&#039;t here - but he a good nigga<br>cause he take care of his REAL family<br>I was just a dumb bitch, tryin to keep, a nigga that I wanted","time":1493840133,"resto":123937200,"id":"VnkR4AjX","country":"RO","country_name":"Romania"},{"no":123951049,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)15:35:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123949185\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123949185<\/a><br>People who choose money and (((career))) over having children aren&#039;t any more fit to breed than people who shit out kids for the welfare.","time":1493840133,"resto":123937200,"id":"7YK9\/j2X","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123951494,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)15:38:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123948273\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123948273<\/a><br>STFU Rajeesh","time":1493840334,"resto":123937200,"id":"VnkR4AjX","country":"RO","country_name":"Romania"},{"no":123952099,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)15:43:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123948273\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123948273<\/a><br>All this graph shows is that the more people born in third world shithole countries, the lower IQ gets.","time":1493840585,"resto":123937200,"id":"6b19q5TE","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123952443,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)15:45:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123942962\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123942962<\/a><br><br>Vicky was precocious as fuck man","time":1493840749,"resto":123937200,"id":"aVQxoF82","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123952609,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)15:47:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123943979\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123943979<\/a><br><br>Also mid 20s and pretty apathetic toward women in general despite being decent looking and having a good job.

(All the women saw the same photo, as did all the men.) Half of the subjects were told that their match was already romantically involved with someone else, while the other half were told that their match was unattached. Then the subjects were all asked how interested they were in their match.<br><br>To the men in the experiment, and to the women who were already in relationships, it didn\u2019t make a significant difference whether their match was single or attached. But single women showed a distinct preference for mate poaching. When the man was described as unattached, 59 percent of the single women were interested in pursuing him. When that same man was described as being in a committed relationship, 90 percent were interested. The researchers write:<br><br>&#039;According to a recent poll, most women who engage in mate poaching do not think the attached status of the target played a role in their poaching decision, but our study shows this belief to be false. Single women in this study were significantly more interested in the target when he was attached. This may be because an attached man has demonstrated his ability to commit and in some ways his qualities have already been \u2018\u2018pre-screened\u201d by another woman.&#039;&quot;","time":1493834267,"resto":123937200,"id":"NAbXLWE2","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123939475,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)13:59:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123937200\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123937200<\/a><br>Most of them are picky so are men","time":1493834382,"resto":123937200,"id":"5utdeGg0","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123939581,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)14:00:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123937200\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123937200<\/a><br>Fapping to the purest waifus.","time":1493834437,"resto":123937200,"id":"9lUlaZgK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123940097,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)14:05:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123939259\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123939259<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;too much to read<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;read it though because bored at work<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;top kek<\/span>","time":1493834716,"resto":123937200,"id":"xI1gzS3R","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123940556,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)14:09:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123940097\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123940097<\/a><br>80\/20 rule famalam.","time":1493834956,"resto":123937200,"id":"LhA9UtgS","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123941188,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)14:14:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"why do i see this posted daily on pol?","time":1493835286,"resto":123937200,"id":"TmKdhgLS","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123941583,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)14:18:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123941188\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123941188<\/a><br>Because it fun seeing whores die out.

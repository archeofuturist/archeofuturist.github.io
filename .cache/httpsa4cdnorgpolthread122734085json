This is the feature I don&#039;t really like myself. However it&#039;s not so simple in practice. Christianity is not some monolithic entity, though it is most often referred to as such. Christianity is a vast network of different denominations and churches that differ from each other to varying degrees. This is the expression of particularism, as opposed to universalism, of Christianity. Much like pagan pantheons are alike to one another though they are not the same, so are Christian churches etc. For example in Finland we have a pretty strong sect called https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Awake<wbr>ning_(religious_movement) And the thing is that the spirit of this sect really strongly resonates with the Finnish mind and way of life. It&#039;s almost like a national (tribal) expression of the whole of Christianity.<br>You should really dig deeper into what Christianity actually is, I recommend starting with this series of podcasts. It gives the pagan angle too in comparison: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=QZG<wbr>A5Be_DqE","filename":"1487899310143","ext":".jpg","w":960,"h":960,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493137137938,"time":1493137137,"md5":"S8od4S4ptqlV+N2uHm0dbg==","fsize":56590,"resto":122734085,"id":"LxsGQnw7","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":122750986,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)12:19:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122750357\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122750357<\/a><br>helloooo christians? what should we do with poor old Mtumbo?","time":1493137163,"resto":122734085,"id":"MFppByjb","country":"IT","country_name":"Italy"},{"no":122750990,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)12:19:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122750436\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122750436<\/a><br>That&#039;s not what the image implied.

The crusades may have been able to reclaim Anatolia. Now Christians act as stand-ins for Jewish interests at a global scale, evangelicals require Israel to be populated by the Jews so their doomsday prophecies can be fulfilled. Christians will let their daughters marry a Christian outside their race before a non Christian inside their race, or even a Christian of a different denomination in the same race. Christian churches spend millions sending Christians to Africa so they can build churches and give food to Africans that they might preach a bastardized shamanistic corruption of the Christian religion, and are the primary proponents of mass immigration and reparations. The atheistic attack on Christianity begins and ends at monogamous nuclear families and traditional gender roles, both of which were standard in pagan Europe anyway, with one exception, Germanic and Celtic tribes were noted as refusing to marry outside their racial group. An attitude not seen in Christians who have lost any sense of attachment to their own flesh and blood, seeing it as a worldly struggle.

Fucking marxists and kikes. <br><br>See this is how you tell who the kike is, Christianity was founded by followers of Jesus much of which weren&#039;t Jewish, Christ was against the jewish establishment - anyway I don&#039;t believe in the faith but I see it&#039;s worth and if you don&#039;t look at the west after its subversion, kill yourselves you nihilist LARPS.","time":1493147361,"resto":122734085,"id":"r\/esM6t3","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122772192,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)15:12:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122771837\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122771837<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Christ was against the jewish establishment<\/span><br>and martin luther was against the catholic establishment. reformed judaism. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;kill yourselves you nihilist LARPS.<\/span><br>not an argument, christians are the biggest LARPS","time":1493147529,"resto":122734085,"id":"ryyTctBW","country":"LV","country_name":"Latvia"},{"no":122773287,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)15:20:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122736865\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122736865<\/a><br>open borders != christianity<br><br>its a failed world tbqh","time":1493148045,"resto":122734085,"id":"JI0ZdoNw","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":122774168,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)15:27:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122737007\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122737007<\/a><br>HA HA HA HA","time":1493148452,"resto":122734085,"id":"ahytsH7K","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122774379,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)15:29:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122773287\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122773287<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;its a failed world tbqh<\/span><br>Your horsepower may vary<br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=el9<wbr>3MIxAf-c","time":1493148564,"resto":122734085,"id":"zmSSiY0J","country":"IS","country_name":"Iceland"},{"no":122774939,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)15:33:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122734085\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122734085<\/a><br>How will he react if someone plays his table top rpg online, with roll20 etc.<br><br>i mean, he wants people to play his rpg, but he hates video games.","filename":"1412202812561","ext":".jpg","w":797,"h":797,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493148832934,"time":1493148832,"md5":"L\/qtn2p4lZ3M894rFGIWwA==","fsize":139965,"resto":122734085,"id":"KbCG+z7h","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":122775294,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)15:36:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122742977\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122742977<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;alex jones<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;credibility <\/span><br>you cant make this up","time":1493149013,"resto":122734085,"id":"ahytsH7K","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122775491,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)15:38:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122775294\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122775294<\/a><br>Filtration systems!","time":1493149105,"resto":122734085,"id":"zmSSiY0J","country":"IS","country_name":"Iceland"},{"no":122775612,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)15:39:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122745737\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122745737<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;relevant training<\/span><br>for what posting on \/pol\/","time":1493149170,"resto":122734085,"id":"ahytsH7K","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122776101,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)15:43:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122750436\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122750436<\/a><br>you are completely retarded<br>do you understand metaphors","time":1493149414,"resto":122734085,"id":"ahytsH7K","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122776924,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)15:50:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122769005\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122769005<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;not until you define the point of christianity<\/span><br>As I already said:<br>&quot;If you know Hinduism I can give you an example how I see it: Christianity is like worship of the brahma alone (universal truth, logos itself), not the various expressions of it (gods and lesser beings etc).

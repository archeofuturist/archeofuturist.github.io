I hate it. Other than that I just hide my power level and often just stay inside. I don&#039;t know of one friend I could comfortably talk politics with, without there being a minefield of &#039;muh feels&#039; to get past. Do you guys watch any youtube or anything - I havent watched any TV for years.","time":1492156523,"resto":121020071,"id":"d3fGzeso","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":121035141,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)03:57:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121020071\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121020071<\/a><br>Only leave those thoughts here.

Just follow what you love, don&#039;t ask anyones permission to persue your dreams and areas of study.

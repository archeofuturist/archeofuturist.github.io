I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn\u2019t want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything.<br>He said, \u201cOh, like you\u2019re doing now?\u201d<br>I was taken aback, and all I could say was \u201cHuh?\u201d but he kept cutting me off and going \u201chuh? huh? huh?\u201d and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying.<br>The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like \u201cSir, you need to pay for those first.\u201d At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.<br>When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually \u201cto prevent any electrical infetterence,\u201d and then turned around and winked at me. I don\u2019t even think that\u2019s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly.","time":1491632867,"resto":120098139,"id":"sMwg0WSc","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":120098868,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)02:29:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120098513\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120098513<\/a><br>He would look a lot better with a good haircut","time":1491632963,"resto":120098139,"id":"bI\/vZyM8","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120098913,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)02:29:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120098699\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120098699<\/a><br><br>lol @ imagination","time":1491632991,"resto":120098139,"id":"tOep\/b7P","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":120098924,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)02:29:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120098699\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120098699<\/a><br><br>Sure, that happened right after you fought a Roo and wrestled a Gator, Quigley.","time":1491632996,"resto":120098139,"id":"9u3wGd+h","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":120098926,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)02:29:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120098513\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120098513<\/a><br>His older bro is a model though so there&#039;s that","time":1491632998,"resto":120098139,"id":"i1TaAPhK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120098976,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)02:30:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120098139\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120098139<\/a><br>F Honor to the Fallen.","filename":"Tre kronor","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":500,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491633032499,"time":1491633032,"md5":"Qw4g3HDbZbkA8b\/Uv4LogQ==","fsize":11035,"resto":120098139,"id":"RCCvT6ZH","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120099056,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)02:31:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"The most important thing you can do for the white race is keep your own life in order.

People think they know more than the experts that have studied AND used the bars. The bars are actually much safer and better on the body and joints than ridged steel bars. So go ahead and make fun of the bars and people using them because they are getting stronger and more powerful than you. So when James Harrison knocks the fool out of someone or C.J.

They will either say yes to constitutional amendments that would give Erdogan sweeping new powers or no \u2014 an act of defiance that would nominally preserve Turkey&#039;s battered democracy.<br><br>Erdogan&#039;s proposed system \u201chas no parallel in the modern world,\u201d wrote Henri Barkey, the director of the Middle East Program at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. \u201cIt eviscerates the power of both the legislative and judicial branches of the government in favor of the executive, which will be concentrated in the hands of one person.\u201d It would also create new presidential term limits allowing Erdogan to remain in office as late as 2029. If all goes to plan, Erdogan will have governed his nation for more than a quarter of a century when he finally steps down.<br><br>Erdogan has made no secret of his desire to reshape the Turkish system. For decades, his supporters argue, Turkey&#039;s dysfunctional parliamentary politics were an obstacle to successful governance and led to crises that triggered military coups. In the wake of last year&#039;s failed coup attempt, they say there&#039;s an even stronger need for a presidency that can withstand plots by unelected officials.<br><br>\u201cIt became clear to us that a presidential system whereby the president is elected by popular vote forces groups to compromise with one another and nominate a candidate whom the public at large could support to win more than 50 percent of the vote,\u201d wrote Ayse Sozen Usluer, a foreign policy adviser to Erdogan. Right now, there is only one figure who could possibly win that share of the vote: Erdogan himself.","filename":"turkey","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":768,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1492171748574,"time":1492171748,"md5":"dCTAizgbUTUqucTh8HXEtw==","fsize":466933,"resto":0,"id":"Oi1lFUBg","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"are-any-muslim-countries-actually-democracies","country_name":"United States","replies":74,"images":5,"unique_ips":36},{"no":121053027,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)08:10:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121052915\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121052915<\/a><br>Kuwait, also probably the most Westernized Muslim country","time":1492171833,"resto":121052915,"id":"43gXqIn1","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121053087,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)08:11:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121052915\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121052915<\/a><br><br>Pakistan","time":1492171873,"resto":121052915,"id":"fXaD0kgb","country":"IT","country_name":"Italy"},{"no":121053127,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)08:11:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121052915\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121052915<\/a><br><br>This pic is so hot.

BAHAHAHAHA. If only you knew you retard. <br><br>You do realize a llocal Kuwaiti can literally murder, torture and rape any of the million foreign migrant workers in their country and get away with it? There is no rule of law in Kuwait. The rule is the guy with most wasta (connections) gets it all. <br><br>I knew a US Marine who told me one of his friends who was in Kuwait got into an argument with a local about some stupid shit, and he was found a few weeks later in a sewer with his balls cut off. It was labelled a suicide. <br><br>There was a case where a Kuwaiti soldier murdered and THEN raped the corpse of his maid \/ slave, and he got away with it. <br><br>Kuwaitis can murder, torture, starve, rape their migrant population and you call that Westernized. They are dirty, filthy uncouth savages. Honestly, it brings a tear to my eye knowing Saddam Hussein could have owned and humiliated that vile, disgusting country. Kuwait is the property of Iraq. UK\/US should never ever have aided this vile, disgusting country. Their fake parliamentary democracy is a complete joke, just like all democracies in Islamic countries. Parliament only works in cultures where the principles of the enlightenment are known and absorbed by the population. That certanily doesn&#039;t existed in a filthy, stinking desert shithole known as Kuwait, where the population are a bunch of perverted rapists who think they can molest and rape any uncovered women because they believe it is their right to do so if a woman &quot;seduces&quot; them.<br><br>Honestly I&#039;m so mad that you called Kuwait Westernized. They are not civilized, they are barely human, let alone Westernized.","time":1492182633,"resto":121052915,"id":"cZ0xHScM","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121071683,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)11:20:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121067676\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121067676<\/a><br><br>As if it isn&#039;t the same in literally every other country. Your country was the origin of the &quot;deep state&quot; meme (NATO stay behind networks \/ Ergenekon), it exists in every country. And while most democracies are usually subverted or at least constrained by the permanent bureaucratic class, there do exist small examples of successful democracies, like direct democracy in the cantons of Glarus or Appenzell Innerhoden in Switzerland. Of course, like any human system they can be subverted and corrupted and I do agree that most systems tend towards oligarchy in the end. With the existence of any secret societies or organizations which infiltrate the institutions of society, you will always end up with an oligarchy where a powerful group sets, or at least constrains, the options available to the public.","filename":"qatari","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":360,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1492183206560,"time":1492183206,"md5":"oTLgikSIMNtF+UJPf5gnhg==","fsize":76900,"resto":121052915,"id":"cZ0xHScM","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121072124,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)11:23:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121064549\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121064549<\/a><br><br>I was thinking... holy shit, a smart Paki and then you chimped out at the end, as usual.

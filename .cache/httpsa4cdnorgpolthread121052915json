They will either say yes to constitutional amendments that would give Erdogan sweeping new powers or no \u2014 an act of defiance that would nominally preserve Turkey&#039;s battered democracy.<br><br>Erdogan&#039;s proposed system \u201chas no parallel in the modern world,\u201d wrote Henri Barkey, the director of the Middle East Program at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. \u201cIt eviscerates the power of both the legislative and judicial branches of the government in favor of the executive, which will be concentrated in the hands of one person.\u201d It would also create new presidential term limits allowing Erdogan to remain in office as late as 2029. If all goes to plan, Erdogan will have governed his nation for more than a quarter of a century when he finally steps down.<br><br>Erdogan has made no secret of his desire to reshape the Turkish system. For decades, his supporters argue, Turkey&#039;s dysfunctional parliamentary politics were an obstacle to successful governance and led to crises that triggered military coups. In the wake of last year&#039;s failed coup attempt, they say there&#039;s an even stronger need for a presidency that can withstand plots by unelected officials.<br><br>\u201cIt became clear to us that a presidential system whereby the president is elected by popular vote forces groups to compromise with one another and nominate a candidate whom the public at large could support to win more than 50 percent of the vote,\u201d wrote Ayse Sozen Usluer, a foreign policy adviser to Erdogan. Right now, there is only one figure who could possibly win that share of the vote: Erdogan himself.","filename":"turkey","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":768,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1492171748574,"time":1492171748,"md5":"dCTAizgbUTUqucTh8HXEtw==","fsize":466933,"resto":0,"id":"Oi1lFUBg","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"are-any-muslim-countries-actually-democracies","country_name":"United States","replies":6,"images":0,"unique_ips":7},{"no":121053027,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)08:10:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121052915\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121052915<\/a><br>Kuwait, also probably the most Westernized Muslim country","time":1492171833,"resto":121052915,"id":"43gXqIn1","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121053087,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)08:11:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121052915\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121052915<\/a><br><br>Pakistan","time":1492171873,"resto":121052915,"id":"fXaD0kgb","country":"IT","country_name":"Italy"},{"no":121053127,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)08:11:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121052915\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121052915<\/a><br><br>This pic is so hot.

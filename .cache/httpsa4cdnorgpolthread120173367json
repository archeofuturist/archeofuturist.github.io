The tilt of the court has regained its conservative tilt. As soon as April 13, Gorsuch could take part in his first private conference, where justices decide whether to hear cases \u2014 and some of them could involve gun rights, voting rights and a Colorado baker&#039;s refusal to design a cake for a same-sex couple&#039;s wedding, The Associated Press reported.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;University of California at Irvine Professor Rick Hasen warned Democrats at the height of the Gorsuch fight that they had little to gain in filibustering the nomination. &quot;Imagine if in a year or so Justices Breyer, Ginsburg, or Kennedy leave the Court,\u201d he wrote on Election Law Blog. \u201cThen things get MUCH worse from the point of view of progressives. Then Roberts becomes the swing voter and there goes affirmative action, abortion rights, etc. If you think things with the Supreme Court are bad for progressive now they can get much, much worse.\u201d<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;But just as Gorsuch begins to get comfortable in his new chambers, Supreme Court observers are considering the real posibility that Trump could name additional justices. The court is collectively older than any other on record. Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Anthony Kennedy and Stephen Breyer are 84, 80 and 78, respectively. Gorsuch&#039;s confirmation process was fought bitterly on both sides. Democrats assailed McConnell for choosing to go nuclear. Sen. Chuck Schumer said afterwards that there&#039;s no incentive for nominees to even speak to the minority anymore.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The Washington Examiner, citing a Trump associates, repeated Trump&#039;s campaign number Friday.

Tampons are a LUXURY. I have no idea why people can&#039;t understand this. If you can&#039;t afford tampons, buy pads. They are much cheaper and for the same purpose.","filename":"13482955_598022550361447_4347886532111119909_o","ext":".jpg","w":2048,"h":1650,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":100,"tim":1493612871717,"time":1493612871,"md5":"rXOahofBhaMJpeG\/G2eCQQ==","fsize":207994,"resto":123570951,"id":"l0bXv3D2","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":123577816,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)00:27:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123576944\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123576944<\/a><br>There are no &quot;natural rights.&quot; Any existing rights are based on what society decides to impose on their own government and themselves. The question is what is worth codifying. There are already legal statutes protecting speech as a negative right, as I pointed out. Positive rights also exist. Education, society has decided, at least through high school, for instance. I just caution against creating new entitlements. If we do, I argue they must be equitable (in this case not favor one sex only) and enhance utility for all (show a correlation between free feminine hygiene products and decreased crime rates or something, idk).","time":1493612877,"resto":123570951,"id":"zFZ8pDij","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123578007,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)00:29:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123570951\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123570951<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I was talking to my girlfriend and she says toilet paper should be free for everybody.

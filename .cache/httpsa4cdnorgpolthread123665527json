I used to make ironic jokes about jews controlling everything. I still make these remarks, only now they&#039;re jokes no longer. I honestly believe 70 years without wars have ruined europe more than any war ever could have. There is nothing worth living for as a white straight male. Goebbels was right. Jews won the war. Eternal darkness is dawned upon us. I can&#039;t handle it. I want to go back to blissful ignorance. I want to feel happiness again. There is no joy in knowledge. I fear I can&#039;t handle it any longer. How can one cope with this gruesome spiral of reality injected as painful doses of truth? Is killing himself ones only escape route?","filename":"goebells-quote","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":329,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":137,"tim":1493669446999,"time":1493669446,"md5":"UtL8blflgPZ5YB8HfJSaOg==","fsize":25370,"resto":0,"id":"6sZ5z9d9","country":"EE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"how-do-you-cope-with-the-truth","country_name":"Estonia","replies":14,"images":2,"unique_ips":9},{"no":123667139,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)16:22:13","name":"sgdfj DFG dsG","com":"<a href=\"#p123665527\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123665527<\/a><br>First of all, I Can relate to you.<br>I understand what you&#039;re feeling since i&#039;ve felt similar things in the past.<br>The worst kind of depression\/stress is the kind that&#039;s omnipresent and never ever absent.<br>To avoid this, you need to clear your mind sometimes in a positive way, I recommend you physical exercise, meditation or just doing things you like.<br>After you get rid of the permanent fear\/stress, you need to evaluate how you can become stronger,more resistant to societal changes.<br>For this, I recommend you to read books about philosophy you like, or to read about history.<br>Learn more about history.

By having value or importance this naturally begs the question, from where to the ideals arise? By conceding that value does exist, and that importance exists, in other words, values of greater weight, it is likewise conceding the fact that a source must exist for them. Otherwise its own truth would be as spurious as another, and then your left with mere nihilism. But refusing to acknowledge if this value is derived from God, or whatever, some pantheistic consciousness, it is leaving part of the equation unanswered. It concedes truth but ignores its source, its saying &quot;we have the truth, but over no evidence or interest in proving why it IS the truth.&quot;","time":1493541746,"resto":123447484,"id":"2mFTUslG","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123457642,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)04:44:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123447484\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123447484<\/a><br>I will bust an egg or two.","time":1493541848,"resto":123447484,"id":"H1Gjqc86","country":"SI","country_name":"Slovenia"},{"no":123457927,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)04:47:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"Morning and evening mass for me today","time":1493542029,"resto":123447484,"id":"Nr5bNiVc","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"}]}

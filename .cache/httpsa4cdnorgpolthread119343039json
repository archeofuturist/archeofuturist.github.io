If UBI was implemented you would get one of two nations to simulate from: Greece and the UAE.<br>Greece has a system where you could retire insanely early and live a comfy ass life, but that shit is unsustainable because there isn&#039;t enough money to maintain the system and when the recession happened they went bust and now the country is imploding on itself.<br>The UAE while successful only gets its maintenance from a finite resource and even then there is a literal slave class in that country because nationals don&#039;t work for the most part. Once the oil is gone their nation will also self destruct but even harder than Greece because they will slaughter each other.<br>Even outside of similar socialist climates UBI is basically like minimum wage, when you raise the minimum wage and the labor costs for companies than they will raise prices to compensate. The exact same thing will happen with UBI except on a governmental scale. Taxes will go up so much that companies will either:<br>a) Speed up automation of factories or,<br>b) Off-shore to nations like China who don&#039;t have UBI because shareholders are more short run focused microeconomically<br>So essentially you&#039;ll lose jobs, wealth will leave the nation and when nobody has the money to maintain UBI the money people get from it will slowly deplete to nothing and then you have violent revolution and thousands if not hundreds of thousands of people will die.

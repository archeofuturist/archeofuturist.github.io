You need to take a long hard look in the mirror and ask yourself if you&#039;re assimilating fascist beliefs (it&#039;s insidious and we must all be guarded against this severe threat) As for the rest of your post (I&#039;m being charitable and assuming that you made a minor lapse and are still a genuine comrade). These people deserve no tolerance. They are, at heart, intolerant and therefore, if not totally fascist already, so close to fascist that it does not warrant distinction. We should NEVER fear the loss of support because, ultimately, we are on the right side of history. If you deviate and moderate yourself towards making the proles happy you are just giving in to fascists and are therefore essentially in league with them. I&#039;ll let you off with a warning in this instance but please be more mindful before you comment in future and thoroughly educate yourself in the doctrine areas you have clearly missed out on.<\/span>","filename":"1487237543131","ext":".jpg","w":573,"h":609,"tn_w":235,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492918838811,"time":1492918838,"md5":"v2yNMpmlMKAqWcp2eCIVQQ==","fsize":52670,"resto":0,"id":"RQBrpIR+","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"how-dare-you-both-assume-my-age-and-use-my","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

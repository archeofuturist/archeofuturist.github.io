Watson talked about how these chemicals are enhanced by sunlight, leading to the supposition that people who are exposed to more sunlight have more of these hormones.<br><br>He talked about an experiment at the University of Arizona where male patients were injected with a melanin extract. The test was designed to see if skin could be chemically darkened as a skin cancer preventive, but it found that as a side effect the men became sexually aroused.","filename":"Watson","ext":".jpg","w":306,"h":341,"tn_w":224,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491015904308,"time":1491015904,"md5":"WR2zUvIH2j9+tQGyeAtIGg==","fsize":35192,"resto":0,"id":"KnkneE2i","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"following-dr-watsons-theory","country_name":"United States","replies":7,"images":3,"unique_ips":8},{"no":119136520,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)23:08:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119136177\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119136177<\/a><br>Fuck America and Israel.","filename":"Amerikike","ext":".png","w":445,"h":450,"tn_w":123,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491016122199,"time":1491016122,"md5":"xYAmyGBizdeLorkvIAMFDA==","fsize":12938,"resto":119136177,"id":"MhkRalJF","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":119136635,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)23:10:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119136520\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119136520<\/a><br>Thank you for your service","time":1491016204,"resto":119136177,"id":"TtyJJrPy","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119137348,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)23:18:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119136177\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119136177<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;no source<\/span>","filename":"1447488779312","ext":".png","w":854,"h":464,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":67,"tim":1491016706263,"time":1491016706,"md5":"+BTrG8JZ5Gmu9a4LnVAPqQ==","fsize":484333,"resto":119136177,"id":"yjirF76H","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119137634,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)23:21:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"Here ya go.","filename":"a946ed","ext":".jpg","w":575,"h":387,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":84,"tim":1491016903624,"time":1491016903,"md5":"9cEhgQDi7AsFbK7SRnlShQ==","fsize":64855,"resto":119136177,"id":"nzza+92K","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119137643,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)23:21:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119137348\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119137348<\/a><br>http:\/\/articles.latimes.com\/2000\/de<wbr>c\/03\/local\/me-60493","time":1491016908,"resto":119136177,"id":"5TnSS0n8","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119137721,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)23:22:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119136177\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119136177<\/a><br>You are not a smart man.","time":1491016958,"resto":119136177,"id":"fCFsNq4r","country":"TH","country_name":"Thailand"},{"no":119138052,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)23:26:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119137634\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119137634<\/a><br><br>I remember the left lost their mind over that.<br><br>The Left: Science bas a liberal bias!<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;it appears not all races are equal<\/span><br>The Left: autistic screeching","time":1491017172,"resto":119136177,"id":"iDarFjq0","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

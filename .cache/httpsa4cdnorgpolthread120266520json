The president last week was very adamant about never attacking Syria. He completely flipped on a dime even with all the pressure to not attack coming from twitter, cernovich etc... <br><br>Jared Kushner is now Trumps #1 advisor. Steve remains a close second but definitely has taken a back seat to Kushner. <br><br>Normally i wouldnt say his name like this but Donald Trump has not been acting himself lately. Steve is worried Jared Kushner has RFID chipped him and we might be next. It is well known within the White House Ivanka is RFID chipped. However, we were gagged to never tell the President. <br><br>If Bannon leaves it will be because he did not want to be chipped. <br><br>If he stays and begins to flip it is because Jared had the CIA chip him. And I&#039;m next. <br><br>Syria is just a ploy to start WW3. Fucking McMaster is just a deep state shill. <br><br>KellyAnne is already chipped. She&#039;s been very quiet lately for a reason. The RFID chip can destroy targeted memories and plant new ones. <br><br>Please start looking into lucid technologies and Jared kushners dealings to create his fuckingg shit toy he controls everything with. <br><br>Ivanka would never have married that fucking KIKE Kushner if he didn&#039;t RFID chip her. <br><br>No questions. I&#039;m very sorry it&#039;s been this long before I replied. <br><br>Godspeed anons","filename":"image","ext":".png","w":385,"h":389,"tn_w":247,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491732397029,"time":1491732397,"md5":"nLpvTj1n5zbvnyppjFHBRQ==","fsize":243309,"resto":0,"id":"NF4IzYiB","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"legit-internal-happenings","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

They love the EU now.<br>They don&#039;t have any other position! I tried to discuss with pro-EU liberals just two days ago. They didn&#039;t know about the (long long) process which lead to the Lisbon treaty, they didn&#039;t know what exactly Maastricht is, they didn&#039;t know that Greece is a Schengen exclave, they didn&#039;t know that the UK never was part of Schengen, they didn&#039;t know that the EU-Parliament is actually no parliament and they didn&#039;t know that just 10% of the Exports of Scotland go to other EU countries.","time":1490975622,"resto":119060615,"id":"fOwRLsQb","country":"AT","country_name":"Austria"},{"no":119068131,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)11:55:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119060615\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119060615<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;why commies love commieland so much?<\/span><br>gee, i wonder why","time":1490975759,"resto":119060615,"id":"75W+rq0p","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"}]}

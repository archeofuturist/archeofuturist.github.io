They replace one criminal with another. They finally held another meeting and this new shill can&#039;t even utter the words about Russian interference.<br><br>Meanwhile the Senate Intelligence Committee has no problem conducting business in a nonpartisan way and are all mature enough to discuss the fact that Russia did interfere and that there are genuine questions as to whether Trump and his people cooperated.<br><br>The more they resist and the harder they try to hide stuff is just that much more more aggressive the liberals and media will be in shutting them down and getting them replaced. Why can&#039;t they just do their fucking jobs? If Trump is truly innocent then what&#039;s the fucking problem?","filename":"mike-conaway","ext":".jpg","w":630,"h":354,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1491513182098,"time":1491513182,"md5":"O7RV\/H0cG6wvYTjoTHSJ3A==","fsize":29089,"resto":0,"id":"sZydjMbx","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"house-intelligence-committee-is-worthless","country_name":"United States","replies":16,"images":6,"unique_ips":8},{"no":119795961,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)17:14:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119795811\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119795811<\/a><br>lol, shill alert<br><br>zero proof that russia did anything you mongrel","time":1491513247,"resto":119795811,"id":"D5GqmCzh","country":"AT","country_name":"Austria"},{"no":119795963,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)17:14:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"cuck","filename":"1482608810620","ext":".gif","w":320,"h":180,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1491513251322,"time":1491513251,"md5":"kbbnXuUMZ3SxXXOGRQ1Dkw==","fsize":2389164,"resto":119795811,"id":"0r3CcfwM","country":"IL","country_name":"Israel"},{"no":119796481,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)17:18:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119795963\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119795963<\/a><br><a href=\"#p119795961\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119795961<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;shills are scared to death the investigations will find something<\/span><br><br>What cucks.

Case in point -- Had to deal with communism, learned that it is shitty for everyone except the rulers, rejected it, now is rebuilding and will not allow another takeover by hostile ideologies, like what happened in Sweden, their neighbour.<br>4 years ago, in Sweden, I saw similar kinds of people to what I see in Estonia, especially attractive women. I now see a fuckton of cucks, Muslims, women wearing hijabs, and feminist nazis with shaven heads. What the fuck happened to Sweden.<br>Short answer -- They got ButtCucked by the EU and Islam.<br>Estonia is having none of that.<br>Russia is having none of that(Except chechnya, which shouldn&#039;t even be considered russian)<br><br>America got its awakening with Trump, now we need to follow him to fight the globalists, muslims, and socialists to the end.","time":1490946168,"resto":118995010,"id":"yzdExYvV","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119034570,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)03:46:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119033773\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119033773<\/a><br>Yum yum \u0432\u043ayc\u043do!","filename":"IMG_6874","ext":".jpg","w":183,"h":275,"tn_w":83,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490946385402,"time":1490946385,"md5":"7+sNt\/za7K8m5d453oqqIQ==","fsize":16748,"resto":118995010,"id":"Zq4kGbQI","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119034826,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)03:50:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118995010\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118995010<\/a><br>Gorky Park is great, when can brothers come visit?","filename":"27DFC8BF021196550747328815104_1.3.2.mp4","ext":".jpg","w":480,"h":480,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490946646462,"time":1490946646,"md5":"yUl5CBMa1U7jAv0bFrz6UQ==","fsize":16218,"resto":118995010,"id":"HnKCZWgC","country":"SI","country_name":"Slovenia"},{"no":119034952,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)03:53:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"\u041aa\u043a \u043co\u0438 \u0436e\u043d\u0449\u0438\u043d\u044b, c\u043ba\u0431\u044be, \u043aa\u043a \u044f\u0433\u043de\u043do\u043a.","filename":"IMG_6875","ext":".jpg","w":634,"h":775,"tn_w":102,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490946786236,"time":1490946786,"md5":"PPGG+RZRmYG7nsT1E75g8g==","fsize":129173,"resto":118995010,"id":"Zq4kGbQI","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119035021,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)03:54:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;harcore russian neonazi&quot; shilling for dissolution of russia just so happen to not know russian language<\/span><br><br>ahahahahahahahahaahahahahahahahahaa<wbr>hahahahahahahahaahahahahahahahahaah<wbr>ahahahahahahahaahahahahahahahahaaha<wbr>hahahahahahahaahahahahahahahahaahah<wbr>ahahahahahahaahahahahahahahahaahaha<wbr>hahahahahahaahahahahahahahahaahahah<wbr>ahahahahahaahahahahahahahahaahahaha<wbr>hahahahahaahahahahahahahahaahahahah<wbr>ahahahahaahahahahahahahahaahahahaha<wbr>hahahahaahahahahahahahahaahahahahah<wbr>ahahahaahahahahahahahahaahahahahaha<wbr>hahahaahahahahahahahahaahahahahahah<wbr>ahahaahahahahahahahahaahahahahahaha<wbr>hahaahahahahahahahahaahahahahahahah<wbr>ahaahahahahahahahahaahahahahahahaha<wbr>haahahahahahahahahaahahahahahahahah<wbr>aahahahahahahahahaahahahahahahahaha<wbr>ahahahahahahahahaahahahahahahahahaa<wbr>hahahahahahahahaahahahahahahahahaah<wbr>ahahahahahahahaahahahahahahahahaaha<wbr>hahahahahahahaahahahahahahahahaahah<wbr>ahahahahahahaahahahahahahahahaahaha<wbr>hahahahahahaahahahahahahahahaahahah<wbr>ahahahahahaahahahahahahahahaahahaha<wbr>hahahahahaahahahahahahahahaahahahah<wbr>ahahahahaahahahahahahahahaahahahaha<wbr>hahahahaahahahahahahahahaahahahahah<wbr>ahahahaahahahahahahahahaahahahahaha<wbr>hahahaahahahahahahahahaahahahahahah<wbr>ahahaahahahahahahahahaahahahahahaha<wbr>hahaahahahahahahahahaahahahahahahah<wbr>ahaahahahahahahahahaahahahahahahaha<wbr>haahahahahahahahahaahahahahahahahah<wbr>a","time":1490946875,"resto":118995010,"id":"CISYBX9I","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":119035583,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)04:04:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119035021\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119035021<\/a><br>Blyad, my eyes!

You and the technician would select the best placed to install the unit: somewhere that shares an outside wall and which doesn\u2019t have any potential obstacles nearby (such as bushes outside or a thermostat inside). A foundation is set up outside, one which can support your heat pump in the exact location required. Holes are drilled in the walls to run refrigerant lines and similar connectors between the inside part of the unit and the outside. The inside part of the unit is set up and installed, then the lines are insulated and run through the openings in the wall. The outside unit is then mounted and secured to its foundation, and the lines are connected and tested to make sure they are properly fitted and sealed. The installer will slowly equalize the pressure, then ensure that the refrigerant gas is fully charged before activating the unit.<br><br>Ideally, that process should take a day or less, though obviously it will be longer if the technician is installing multiple units as part of a ductless mini-split system.","time":1491931890,"resto":120614758,"id":"GWzQRxwf","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120625396,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)13:31:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120625273\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120625273<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;42 posts by this ID<\/span><br><br>what&#039;s his endgame?","time":1491931900,"resto":120614758,"id":"BFz+72F1","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120625454,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)13:32:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120625085\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120625085<\/a><br>I could get a job in Virginia working the coal mines like my ancestors did.

I got through it but hated every second. <br><br>However, now it&#039;s fun to just start random projects at home late at night.","time":1491940439,"resto":120614758,"id":"fWI4mb8i","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120647361,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)16:02:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120645325\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120645325<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;equating swimming in money with doing something great<\/span><br><br>it&#039;s obvious you are a loser retard","time":1491940944,"resto":120614758,"id":"j6fVY5\/J","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120647364,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)16:02:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120623404\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120623404<\/a><br>Fuck no<br><br>When my highschool band teacher dropped over 100 applied, some of them in their forties, the one who got it was teaching college percussion in Texas.","time":1491940945,"resto":120614758,"id":"sdE\/q2NR","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120648213,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)16:08:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120635359\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120635359<\/a><br>But how do you feeeeeeeel mannnn","time":1491941280,"resto":120614758,"id":"WBQqLbWY","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120648336,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)16:08:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120614758\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120614758<\/a><br>HE THINKS LE MUSIC IS AN ACTUAL DEGREE <br>ACTUALLY CONSIDERED WASTING MONEY ON THAT TOILET PAPER<br><br>https:\/\/discord.gg\/7ZBqx3m","filename":"recruit","ext":".jpg","w":1147,"h":720,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":78,"tim":1491941333634,"time":1491941333,"md5":"ZlH1XX+8m34pNoTuX5Yibw==","fsize":474981,"resto":120614758,"id":"cqr85rjx","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":120648604,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)16:10:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120647361\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120647361<\/a><br>Nah you didn&#039;t specify what you meant when you said doing something great, also fuck off you know if you don&#039;t have money in this world you aren&#039;t shit I&#039;m not wrong.","filename":"IMG_0671","ext":".jpg","w":342,"h":337,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":123,"tim":1491941450922,"time":1491941450,"md5":"xxZzaSOSlT9TmKjY5E67PQ==","fsize":22733,"resto":120614758,"id":"VVtaXeFD","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120649370,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)16:15:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120648604\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120648604<\/a><br>most people in this world that did the really great things lived and died penniless","time":1491941757,"resto":120614758,"id":"j6fVY5\/J","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120649740,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)16:18:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120614758\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120614758<\/a><br>I&#039;m literally in the same exact position.

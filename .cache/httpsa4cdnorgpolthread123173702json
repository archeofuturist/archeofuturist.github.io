The actual story of how they came to be in power is much more important and interesting, but no one is going to spoon feed it to you because it&#039;s absurdly complicated and no one really understands it too well anyhow. It&#039;s not as if there are lots of things that have been erased or added from history (although there are definitely some), it&#039;s more critical context or causation that&#039;s overlooked. <br><br>Star.ships by Gordon White is good for a history of civilization that I think is the best you can get in a single book. I recommend Joseph Farrell&#039;s books as well, take everything with a grain of salt but it&#039;s in a class of its own for demonstrating how one might dig into things and learn shit about history that doesn&#039;t at all fit with the established narrative, and yet has clear evidence.

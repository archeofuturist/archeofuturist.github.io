It was that I was unable to ignore the pattern you describe. When he began pushing Bannon out and inviting busloads of hebes and globalists in to &#039;advise&#039; him, it was no longer possible for me to deny that I had no idea who or what I had voted for. It was no one thing, it was just a constant down slide since the election.<br><br>There were two things I noticed before the election that gave me a bad vibe. One was when he backtracked on &#039;they all have to go&#039; after making such a big deal out of it, and the other is when he stabbed Paul Nehlen in the back who had endorsed him, and instead endorsed Nehlens competitor, Paul Ryan.<br><br>Im just done voting. I dont care which jew cartel destroys the nation. Elections are pointless if both parties are corrupt and we only have two. Neither party can save the US, neither wants to.<br><br>If we had an action-Trump that matched the speech-Trump, it would at least be possible. Clearly, that doesnt exist, and we are back to being fine with China &quot;raping us with the biggest theft in history like a magic act&quot; and if no one can actually remember an Iranian terrorist attacking the US, we&#039;ll just pretend they are there to placate Israel. No one even tries to explain what &#039;Iran sponsored terrorism&quot; against the US means. Apparently it means they are muslims who know other muslims who disagree with Israeli hegemony, so naturally that should be our biggest concern, not narco wars directly south of our own fucking border that our &#039;department of defense&#039;, funded as it is, cannot seem to actually defend. We have two oceans and Canada, and the one fucking unstable border we have, the largest military in human history cant defend.<br><br>I quit. its that simple. There is no &quot;United States&quot;. Its an archaic 20th century joke. I cant identify with a nation that doesnt exist. Once a nation is corrupt past the point of saving, its not like they announce it in the paper.","filename":"donald-trump-eating_ice_cream","ext":".jpg","w":460,"h":490,"tn_w":117,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492782401231,"time":1492782401,"md5":"VfLQfOrBYf70+ppcTWUK3A==","fsize":46615,"resto":122126284,"id":"+NyQqNB2","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

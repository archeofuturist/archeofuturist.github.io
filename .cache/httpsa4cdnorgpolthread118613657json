The first entirely professional team was founded after the American Civil War in 1869, first league in 1876. All men have a natural position, manlet or not. It&#039;s a game of brains, experience, and skill, not pure athleticism. There is always victory, never a tie. Teams cannot jew each other for outs, each team always gets at least 27 batting opportunities.<br><br>When will Europe learn to wrap their heads around a game with no time limit? When will Europe grow some self esteem and take another step past hopscotch? When will Europe realize the name &quot;Football&quot; was already taken by a superior sport? Oh wait, that was one of our many other sports that are superior to Soccer. <br><br>Discuss.","filename":"1869 Cincinnati Red Stockings","ext":".jpg","w":662,"h":530,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":200,"tim":1490677399929,"time":1490677399,"md5":"JRs5nhd19HLeryYVNFup4Q==","fsize":71265,"resto":0,"id":"4jO03oEA","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"why-is-the-wests-oldest-sport-only-played-in-the","country_name":"United States","replies":19,"images":3,"unique_ips":14},{"no":118615841,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)01:28:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118613657\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118613657<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;There is always victory, never a tie.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;each team always gets at least 27 batting opportunities.<\/span>","time":1490678906,"resto":118613657,"id":"oSDpcgd9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118615975,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)01:29:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118613657\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118613657<\/a><br>It&#039;s boring as fuck to watch and almost twice as boring to play","time":1490678995,"resto":118613657,"id":"JjibyIU8","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118616373,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)01:34:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118615975\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118615975<\/a><br>Fuck off leaf or we&#039;ll take The Bluejays back just like the Expos and give them to Japan.","filename":"1490554540511","ext":".jpg","w":585,"h":560,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":119,"tim":1490679251607,"time":1490679251,"md5":"8h1V7J7Cx7F\/46bQD8hrxg==","fsize":143958,"resto":118613657,"id":"4jO03oEA","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118616661,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)01:37:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118615975\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118615975<\/a><br>Didn&#039;t take long for the weak armed faggot to out himself ITT. <br><br>No feeling in the world like blowing a fastball by a dude when he knows it&#039;s coming.","time":1490679453,"resto":118613657,"id":"bEUwPfgs","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118616953,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)01:40:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118615975\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118615975<\/a><br>Sorry, baseball *is* the white mans&#039; sport.

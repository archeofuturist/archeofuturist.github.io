Let&#039;s see if I can get some interest this week as well. I&#039;ll start with a brief blurb on &quot;sati&quot;, which is usually translated as &quot;mindfulness&quot;, but &quot;mindfulness&quot; is so contaminated with new agey associations you might as well forget the English word. The Buddhist term means something different from whatever you&#039;re thinking.<br><br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sati_<wbr>(Buddhism)<br><br>There is absolutely nothing more important than direct awareness of what&#039;s going on in your mind. Nothing else compares. All your thoughts and actions are dictated by simple habitual mental shortcuts, and which shortcut you end up using and how well it works mostly depends on the current state of your mind and physical body. Turning your intelligence directly toward understanding those states on an intuitive level makes your mental shortcuts work much, much better. It&#039;s the difference between a five year old acting on instinct, and a self-aware adult seeing a situation, allowing his full creative faculties to understand what his senses are telling him, and acting accordingly. Is your mental awareness at the level of a five year old? If you haven&#039;t seriously asked yourself this question, it almost certainly is, no matter what your intuitive notion of your own level of self-awareness might be.","filename":"colors","ext":".png","w":1102,"h":788,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":178,"tim":1492354686796,"time":1492354686,"md5":"5WaU9RJA8OOZGFD6sooYcQ==","fsize":2370056,"resto":0,"id":"SOOds3do","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"why-arent-you-a-buddhist-yet","country_name":"United States","replies":8,"images":1,"unique_ips":3},{"no":121366551,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)10:59:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"cont.<br><br>Most people have some vague notion of how their mind works that they acquired just by living and doing things, but because they&#039;re busy and have tons of things to think about, a complicated project like studying their own mind is out of the question. That&#039;s a shame, because it&#039;s really not as complicated as it seems when you start out. Your mind&#039;s activity is unpredictable, highly variable, and dependent on whatever is going on with your body at the time and what you&#039;ve been thinking about over the past several days, but there aren&#039;t really that many different basic states it can be in.<br><br>It only seems complicated because you don&#039;t have a good framework of organization and classification to associate your own direct experiences with, and be able to verbally notice &quot;I&#039;ve previously labeled this current feeling with this particular name, and it&#039;s caused by that other thing that I&#039;ve assigned this other name, and results in this new thing that has that other name&quot;. The converse problem is to go full psychoanalysis and think that you need to memorize an entire library of complicated made up concepts to understand anything about your mind. Fortunately, that&#039;s not necessary, when much simpler classification systems like the one Buddhism uses are much more useful and directly applicable. Buddhism&#039;s classifications aren&#039;t the &quot;truth&quot; of what your mind is like - it&#039;s just a map, not the territory. But it&#039;s a damn good map.","filename":"Buddhist-Cheat-Sheet","ext":".jpg","w":736,"h":688,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":116,"tim":1492354763529,"time":1492354763,"md5":"v9RwllllBmlxv7w0TPjWUw==","fsize":113543,"resto":121366423,"id":"SOOds3do","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121366587,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)10:59:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"final<br><br>Complimentary short sutras:<br><br>The All <br>http:\/\/www.accesstoinsight.org\/tipi<wbr>taka\/sn\/sn35\/sn35.023.than.html<br><br>The Hindrances<br>http:\/\/www.accesstoinsight.org\/tipi<wbr>taka\/sn\/sn46\/sn46.055.wlsh.html<br><br>There are a few people on \/pol\/ who practice Buddhism and other traditional methods of awareness training - what kinds of insights have you had so far, and have they been helpful in your lives in practice?

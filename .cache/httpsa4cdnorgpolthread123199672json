Jacob cheated his right to inherit Isaac from his bro who was the firstborn Esau:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;As instructed, Jacob retrieved the goats and gave them to his mother who prepared the meal for Isaac. Rebekah clothed Jacob with Esau\u2019s best clothing and covered his hands and neck with goatskins to make him appear hairy like his brother. She then handed the prepared meal to Jacob to deliver to his father.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Jacob approached Isaac and said, \u201cI am Esau, your firstborn. I have done as you told me. Please, sit up and eat some of my game so that you may give me your blessing.\u201d<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Isaac responded, \u201cHow did you find it so quickly, my son?\u201d<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u201cThe Lord gave me success\u201d, Isaac replied.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Then Isaac told Jacob, \u201cCome nearer so that I may touch you to verify that you are my son Esau.\u201d<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Jacob went close to his father who touched him and said, \u201cThe voice is the voice of Jacob but the hands are the hands of Esau.\u201d.<\/span><br>It&#039;s that simple. Without Jacob tricking his father Jews wouldn&#039;t exist, unless Judaism would&#039;ve survived through another tribe.<br>2. Prosecuted minorities always let themselves cheat the system. It&#039;s a rule. As long as they&#039;re underprivileged you can&#039;t help it, for fact.","filename":"image252","ext":".png","w":550,"h":439,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":199,"tim":1493389598013,"time":1493389598,"md5":"XvTPAweQ\/FPauVflwbOXIQ==","fsize":188493,"resto":0,"id":"ZsnBe0\/p","country":"IL","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"lemme-rp-you-about-jews","country_name":"Israel","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

I&#039;ve seen them with my own two eyes and I have really not found a reason not to. There&#039;s plenty of things to do, rents are dirt cheap, mortgages are dirt cheap, cost of living is dirt cheap. It&#039;s not the liberal cesspit that California has so desperately tried to become. I identify with the people there more so than I do here in California. I am the weird guy that nobody wants to talk to because my interests include firearms, working on vehicles, outdoorsy stuff, not being a bitch and pursuing intellectual and spiritual wellbeing instead of material excess and shit. I have a couple leads on jobs there and more than enough cash to float me a few months while I look and crash in my brother&#039;s spare room. Basically, I&#039;m looking for things I may have overlooked in my decision making here. I&#039;m particularly interested in responses from zonies about living in the Phoenix area. I&#039;ve lived in the desert before and the heat is not an issue for me, I actually quite enjoy it. What are some of the day to day things that suck about living there?","filename":"6871930-arizona[1]","ext":".jpg","w":1600,"h":1200,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1492408068875,"time":1492408068,"md5":"8FYuYJemnsCr08x431eQnw==","fsize":1224116,"resto":0,"id":"qeEjXXCy","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"redpill-me-on-arizona","country_name":"United States","replies":13,"images":1,"unique_ips":11},{"no":121487016,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)01:48:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"It&#039;s shit.","time":1492408110,"resto":121486944,"id":"gwnN4Kkr","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121487056,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)01:48:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121487016\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121487016<\/a><br>This, coming from an Arizonan","time":1492408136,"resto":121486944,"id":"Y7ph\/HnZ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121487137,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)01:49:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121486944\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121486944<\/a><br>I got Phoenix in my iphone weather app. I check it from time to time.

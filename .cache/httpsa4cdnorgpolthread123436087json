Despite this discouragement, Philip gave up neither his project to secure a bigamous marriage nor his life of sensuality, which kept him for years from receiving communion.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; According to Martin Luther, he lived &quot;constantly in a state of adultery and fornication.&quot;[7]<\/span><br><br><a href=\"#p123439009\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123439009<\/a><br><br>Even catholic and orthodoc churches are completely cucked for islam.

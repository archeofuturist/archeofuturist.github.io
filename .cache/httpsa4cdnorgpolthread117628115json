So that also I think in some sense undermines the claim of science to anything approaching a universal truth because obviously life can get along perfectly well without it.&quot;","filename":"NEWS_Jordan_Peterson-NATHAN_CHANTHE_VARSITY-C4C_Event_on_mental_health-1080x720","ext":".jpg","w":1080,"h":720,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1490106095924,"time":1490106095,"md5":"jXP9rKSof4c2uyTnvW8s0Q==","fsize":158746,"resto":0,"id":"ug65T0fX","country":"AU","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"what-did-he-mean-by-this","country_name":"Australia","replies":84,"images":18,"unique_ips":47},{"no":117628271,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)10:23:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"11 minutes into this speech:<br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Rcm<wbr>WssTLFv0<br><br>Is he dumb enough to be say that because Animals don&#039;t use science; the scientific laws we&#039;ve discovered don&#039;t apply universally?","filename":"Screen Shot 2017-03-20 at 12.04.48 PM","ext":".png","w":240,"h":316,"tn_w":94,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490106203161,"time":1490106203,"md5":"T13pb8i8XiOIR52pdzZSpg==","fsize":138999,"resto":117628115,"id":"ug65T0fX","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":117628545,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)10:26:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"natural instinct","time":1490106384,"resto":117628115,"id":"hVC2vXLY","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":117628730,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)10:28:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117628271\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117628271<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Is he dumb enough to be say that<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;capital A in animal<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;uses semicolon to seem smarter than he is<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;flag<\/span>","filename":"1483710890299","ext":".png","w":374,"h":345,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":115,"tim":1490106517358,"time":1490106517,"md5":"TKbFjqVGy\/7MVtsuLpljZg==","fsize":206726,"resto":117628115,"id":"QqauBgQG","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117628842,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)10:29:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117628730\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117628730<\/a><br>If he doesn&#039;t capitalize it, his wife gets filled with Emu sperm as punishment.","time":1490106593,"resto":117628115,"id":"HqEJOoe3","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117629096,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)10:32:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"Science is fatal","time":1490106752,"resto":117628115,"id":"MCa\/wP+b","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117629244,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)10:34:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117628842\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117628842<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;taking the Emu juice<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;punishment<\/span>","time":1490106843,"resto":117628115,"id":"mHbliw7T","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":117629543,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)10:37:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"Bachelor of Arts in <br>Political Science<br>Psychology<br><br>PhD in Clinical Psychology<br><br>Talks about science like he knows anything<br><br><br>FRAUD LOSER IDIOT<br><br><a href=\"#p117628730\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117628730<\/a><br>They have a smuggie about faggots like you.<br>Disregard your retard hero ramblings of utter stupidity and attack 2 tiny mistakes<br>Sad fucking life for you Peterson Parrot fuccbois<br>That&#039;s for sure<br>Also, Portuguese is the native language in Brazil.

Questions about the nature of... well, nature.<br><br>But it *can&#039;t* answer:<br><br>- Political debates (what should we do as a society)<br>- Moral questions (how should one act)<br>- Questions of opinion\/subjectivity (whether certain music is good, etc.)<br><br>I think Peterson has correctly identified that some people think that you CAN answer those questions scientifically. They say &quot;reducing carbon emissions IS THE ONLY CORRECT ANSWER TO THE ENVIRONMENTAL DEBATE, BECAUSE SCIENCE&quot;<br><br>There&#039;s two sides to the debate though; the other would point out that trying to eliminate carbon entirely will put people out of jobs, it will destroy certain industries, even when other countries are engaging in these industries. Basically I think that he thinks it is wrong to approach these sorts of subjective questions from a scientific perspective, assuming that there is a single correct answer.","time":1490112996,"resto":117628115,"id":"BZWXQHA1","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":117639162,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)12:16:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117628115\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117628115<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I have a fetish for science<\/span><br>It&#039;s just a tool you moron, its not going to answer fundamental questions about human life","time":1490113011,"resto":117628115,"id":"aeGNHaDU","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":117639357,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)12:18:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117635741\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117635741<\/a><br>Animals do science according to that definition of learning from trial and error.

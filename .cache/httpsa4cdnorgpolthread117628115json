So that also I think in some sense undermines the claim of science to anything approaching a universal truth because obviously life can get along perfectly well without it.&quot;","filename":"NEWS_Jordan_Peterson-NATHAN_CHANTHE_VARSITY-C4C_Event_on_mental_health-1080x720","ext":".jpg","w":1080,"h":720,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1490106095924,"time":1490106095,"md5":"jXP9rKSof4c2uyTnvW8s0Q==","fsize":158746,"resto":0,"id":"ug65T0fX","country":"AU","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"what-did-he-mean-by-this","country_name":"Australia","replies":52,"images":15,"unique_ips":29},{"no":117628271,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)10:23:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"11 minutes into this speech:<br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Rcm<wbr>WssTLFv0<br><br>Is he dumb enough to be say that because Animals don&#039;t use science; the scientific laws we&#039;ve discovered don&#039;t apply universally?","filename":"Screen Shot 2017-03-20 at 12.04.48 PM","ext":".png","w":240,"h":316,"tn_w":94,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490106203161,"time":1490106203,"md5":"T13pb8i8XiOIR52pdzZSpg==","fsize":138999,"resto":117628115,"id":"ug65T0fX","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":117628545,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)10:26:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"natural instinct","time":1490106384,"resto":117628115,"id":"hVC2vXLY","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":117628730,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)10:28:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117628271\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117628271<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Is he dumb enough to be say that<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;capital A in animal<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;uses semicolon to seem smarter than he is<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;flag<\/span>","filename":"1483710890299","ext":".png","w":374,"h":345,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":115,"tim":1490106517358,"time":1490106517,"md5":"TKbFjqVGy\/7MVtsuLpljZg==","fsize":206726,"resto":117628115,"id":"QqauBgQG","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117628842,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)10:29:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117628730\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117628730<\/a><br>If he doesn&#039;t capitalize it, his wife gets filled with Emu sperm as punishment.","time":1490106593,"resto":117628115,"id":"HqEJOoe3","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117629096,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)10:32:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"Science is fatal","time":1490106752,"resto":117628115,"id":"MCa\/wP+b","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117629244,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)10:34:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117628842\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117628842<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;taking the Emu juice<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;punishment<\/span>","time":1490106843,"resto":117628115,"id":"mHbliw7T","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":117629543,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)10:37:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"Bachelor of Arts in <br>Political Science<br>Psychology<br><br>PhD in Clinical Psychology<br><br>Talks about science like he knows anything<br><br><br>FRAUD LOSER IDIOT<br><br><a href=\"#p117628730\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117628730<\/a><br>They have a smuggie about faggots like you.<br>Disregard your retard hero ramblings of utter stupidity and attack 2 tiny mistakes<br>Sad fucking life for you Peterson Parrot fuccbois<br>That&#039;s for sure<br>Also, Portuguese is the native language in Brazil.

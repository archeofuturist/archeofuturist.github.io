Aryans are a separate civilization, they are the &quot;angels&quot; in heaven who fought Lucifer and his rebellion. The fallen are the pre adamites. <br><br>I think in realistic terms these were two ET or even Earth civilizations, which fought each other over a quarrel in morality. The Elohim won, and the pre-adamite &quot;homo capesis&quot; elongated skull tall beings lost. <br><br>These beings then negotiated a treaty somewhere in the 6th century to live amongst humans hidden. Their function would be to tempt us with sin and vice, so that we may prove ourselves worthy of the Elohim by defying and rejecting said sin. The jews are at the forefront of this, and are the most connected to the pre-adamites, in fact I&#039;d argue they are the servants of Saturn or &quot;Satan&quot; or Lucifer whatever you want to call it. Masons are another form of this trickery. They promise power and Godhood and trick you into surrendering your morality. <br><br>The fallen primarily function as bitter enemies of humanity, in the sense that they lure us into sin, then rape and cannibalize us, thinking they are justified in doing so because we failed the test of the Elohim. They hate God and Jesus in particular, so they work hard to warp the pure with religions like catholicism, judaism, islam etc. Archetypes they themselves have manufactured to control society. <br><br>The cruelty of the pre adamites will motivate us sons and daughters of the Elohim (pure breed whites with high proportion of aryan genetics) to either kill or permanently exile the pre-adamites. And onl;y through conflict can we evolve our intelligence and morality\/spirituality to do so. <br><br>The Elohim await the day we are worthy of joining their civilization.

Source intended it as so to experience duality in various spectra. <br><br>Excluding evil seems to me to be of the new age variety of &quot;just think nice thoughts and all will be well&quot;. This is clearly not so. Evil must die screaming I say. The murderous impulses that man has are for this purpose alone. To kill evil is righteous when done in self defense. Humanity has often misunderstood its impulses to kill as an evolutionary defense mechanism purely against predators. But I believe it has a higher function. Anything can be transmuted into it&#039;s lighter and higher variety, including the occasional impulses to harm in humanity. <br><br>While it is true we can never fully kill evil off, we can certainly minimize its effects. These pre adamites for example. They believe themselves superior, yet where is their civilization? Why are they fallen and not thriving in their own worlds? <br><br>Clearly the axioms of their belief systems were erroneous, as falsity leads to chaos and destructive action. Is evil necessary? Sure, it gives meaning to the good. But to exclude evil is to transcend it by removing its influences on humanity. True humanity, meaning the whites. <br><br>It is our destiny to exterminate the fallen. Slaughtering them shall hone our senses and intelligence, but we shall do so in the spirit of peace and higher minded compassion. After all, they kidnap and rape and eat our children. It is merely self defense that they must end. By our wills, it shall be done. And if it so happens that we die in the pursuit of cleansing evil, we shall die honorably and tend towards source. Our greatest challenge now shall be to kill without the desire to murder. A seeming contradiction, but I believe to see moments as expressions in consciousness as opposed to time, we can forgive ourselves of the killing that must be done of the fallen freaks. Overcoming their higher IQ&#039;s and armies of subservient fools shall be a wonderful test of spirit and will.","filename":"ArchangelMichael","ext":".jpg","w":715,"h":881,"tn_w":101,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490736315781,"time":1490736315,"md5":"tmIhOEqJSAmAv54pebN0gg==","fsize":99933,"resto":118681182,"id":"vddyAssL","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118698944,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)17:26:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118698599\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118698599<\/a><br>That is the basis of hermeticism.

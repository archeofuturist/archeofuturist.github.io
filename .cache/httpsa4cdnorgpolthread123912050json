However we couldn&#039;t side with the central powers because we were in economic crisis caused by the money spended in the unification,the colonial campaing and because we have a debt with british banks, plus at the time we couldn&#039;t provide food for the people of italy, and France and UK promised us the removal of the debt, lands and food for the troops at least.<br>Ww2 you are right it was a betrayl that cost us a lot, at least some uf us joined the Germans in the RSI.","time":1493822656,"resto":123912050,"id":"Ao2EiarG","country":"IT","country_name":"Italy"}]}

Russian plutocratic-oligarchic power is totally corrupted and fatally disfunctional, everything it touches turns into shit, extreme poverty and dirt. Before Maidan revolution and Russia-backed rebellion in the Eastern part of the country, Ukraine&#039;s army practicaly didn&#039;t exist. When the mess began, it counted barely 10 functional batallion group. Now the number is reaching 70 well managed and well armed batallion combat groups which places Ukraine as an owner of the strongest land component in whole Europe except Russia. What if they have another Maidan, but this time anti-Polish and turn this shit against us?<br><br>Russian rules over all these Russian-speaking countries are the best guarantee that they will always be poverty-ridden, disarmed and completely not dangerous, deprived of any national ambitions and supplying Russia&#039;s, ours and Germany&#039;s economy with cheap slave workers. Russian power over them will cause that they will never receive any significant Western investments, wich will help keeping them in everlasting poverty and weakness.<br><br>Of course, we wouldn&#039;t want Russia to touch Poland, but i really doubt that Putin is stupid enough to march into Germany\/American influence zone so easily, packed with 300 bln dollar of direct investments, full of 40 mln of hostile people who don&#039;t speak Russian and have nothing in common with so called &quot;Russian world&quot;, especially now when we invest a lot in defence, buy American weapon worth billions dollars and build new levels of bilateral military cooperation with the USA - also partially independently from NATO.","time":1490529391,"resto":118352647,"id":"ATj2Jr7c","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":118356264,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)08:21:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118354439\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118354439<\/a><br><br>they could be also always used to keep russia in check and pressure it, by giving them a cookie or snickers and persuading to bark at the russian master... <br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=RyW<wbr>IsEi5Ujw","time":1490530886,"resto":118352647,"id":"OXFbL6m3","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"}]}

For instance, the 1947 speech he&#039;s quoting contains the sentence: <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I wish to make quite clear that Canada is perfectly within her rights in selecting the persons whom we regard as desirable future citizens. It is not a &quot;fundamental human right&quot; of any alien to enter Canada. It is a privilege.

We&#039;re saying the same thing here but we&#039;re just wording it using different construct. I use the notion of presupposition and he use the notion of a spiral. But if we&#039;re right, it means that the reversal of current policy will have to pass through a careful analysis of our current set of presupposition and a their subsequent destruction or modification. Furthermore, we may introduce new presuppositions that conflicts with the old ones.<br><br>(One such presupposition, for instance, is the notion that all human differences are, in point of fact, surface differences. This seems to be the underlying belief of many people that do not see any problem with unlimited immigration. There may be apparent differences, they argue, but it would be a mistake to conflate them with our deeper commonality as human being, which bind us into some sort of brotherhood.

You&#039;ll be arguing about discrimination on the basis of race, religion and national origin and he&#039;ll tell you that &quot;we&#039;re all human and we all have rights&quot;. In other words, he&#039;ll go into his presupposition set (which is emotionally charged) and refuse your policy proposal because it conflicts with said presupposition set. He will strongly resist.<br><br>But if that person were to start to perceive &quot;human rights&quot; as a result of a western historical development, a development that didn&#039;t happen anywhere else in the world by definition, a development that does not exist, for instance, in Islam, and if we were furthermore to suggest that human rights were only made such because of the hegemonic status of the west post-WWII (and here we&#039;re being clever, since we&#039;re associating &quot;human rights&quot; with some other presupposed notion, which is &quot;western imperialism = bad&quot;) then this person, I argue, would immediately be more receptive to the idea of a different demographic policy.<br><br>Indeed, since human rights and human needs do not flow from the mere fact of being human, it will also follow that they are fragile, can be lost, and can be jeopardized by people who do not hold these values. (One of the bad consequence of the notion of &quot;human rights&quot; and &quot;humanity&quot; is that people believe that the west is not a historically contingent cultural product, and that their way of life is invincible. Indeed, if our way of life simply flow from &quot;human nature&quot; and if &quot;we&#039;re all human&quot;, then it follows that we all want, broadly speaking, the same thing. This &quot;thing&quot; will be, to the western mind, our current way of life.

The ouroboros, in all myth, corresponds to the initial stage of creation during which the totality of the universe and humanity is merged together in a single entity which encompasses all beings, all contradiction, and in which no one is differentiated from one another.

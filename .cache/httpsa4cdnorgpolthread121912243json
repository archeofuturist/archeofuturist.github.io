Antifa have copied the riot police tactic of grabbing a guy out of the enemy front line, dragging him back, and beating him up there. Avoid letting yourself get surrounded and grabbed, and if you see a guy getting grabbed get a bunch of people to go help him.<br><br>2. Antifa very heavily rely on masks and anonymity to operate. Removing the mask of an antifa essentially puts him out of the fight because he can no longer commit crimes without being detected. If you&#039;re still in the &quot;minor scuffling&quot; phase try to remove antifa masks to prevent them from being able to escalate with impunity (like bashing people over the head with combination locks).<br><br>3. Antifa and the black block are two slightly different things. The black block is a technique that antifa use in order to appear larger and more dangerous than they actually are, as well as to maintain anonymity in a large crowd. If you see a large group of people wearing black with black facemasks, although some of them are antifa (by which I mean people actually trained in riot tactics and capable of fighting), a lot of them are random liberals vaguely affiliated with antifa \/ anarchist movements who want to have a fun time (useful idiots). This means that man-for-man, the black block is inferior because while anti-antifa guys show up ready for a fight, only the antifa guys within the black block are ready for a fight. <br><br>In general, if you can maintain roughly equal numbers on a static front line and support each other so that no one gets grabbed and beaten up behind enemy lines, you should do quite well against antifa assuming that all of your guys are capable and willing to fight. To preemptively neutralise antifa go for their face coverings. They don&#039;t just use them to look &quot;cool&quot;, they use them to break the law.","time":1492646096,"resto":121912243,"id":"gZVdFe1A","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121918824,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)19:55:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121918283\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121918283<\/a><br>Don&#039;t plan for large scale formations.

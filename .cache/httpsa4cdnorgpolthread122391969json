It&#039;s rapidly losing market share to altcoins as its use as a payment network is being hindered by soaring transaction fees (avg transaction fee is around $0.45 now, up about 50x from a year ago). If it gets enough miner backing to fork off to raise the capacity limits it has a bright future as ahead and further decentralization and thus security of the network will continue to rise. <br><br>It is looking hopeful that (((Blockstream))) will lose their grasp on the development of btc, thwarting their plans to keep on-chain transactions expensive and forcing users to go through their payment hubs so they can profit off of the users themselves while adding an extra unnecessary layer of centralization. <br><br>I feel first the market price must see a fairly heavy correction to force miners in to capitulating and signaling to fork the network to raise the capacity limits. This will be the time to buy in.","time":1492932343,"resto":122391969,"id":"zUm5OpJg","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122395762,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)03:29:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122394467\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122394467<\/a><br>Lets hope they dont drop their smartphones filled with bitcoin into the polluted rivers they like to swim in.","time":1492932545,"resto":122391969,"id":"\/0E0S0kl","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":122396213,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)03:37:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122395562\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122395562<\/a><br>Would Satoshi ever intervene if Bitcoin looked to be in real trouble?

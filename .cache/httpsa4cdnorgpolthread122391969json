It&#039;s rapidly losing market share to altcoins as its use as a payment network is being hindered by soaring transaction fees (avg transaction fee is around $0.45 now, up about 50x from a year ago). If it gets enough miner backing to fork off to raise the capacity limits it has a bright future as ahead and further decentralization and thus security of the network will continue to rise. <br><br>It is looking hopeful that (((Blockstream))) will lose their grasp on the development of btc, thwarting their plans to keep on-chain transactions expensive and forcing users to go through their payment hubs so they can profit off of the users themselves while adding an extra unnecessary layer of centralization. <br><br>I feel first the market price must see a fairly heavy correction to force miners in to capitulating and signaling to fork the network to raise the capacity limits.

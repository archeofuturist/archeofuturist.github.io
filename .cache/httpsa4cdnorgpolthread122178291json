Basically it&#039;s a tax system, culture, educational system, and financial system that does not favour couples over individuals. MGTOW is the most redpilled philosophy so by definition MGTOW party would be the most redpilled political system. A system of government by the people, for the people, of the people, EAGLE! Not a system run by Chads for Chads, cough cough Trump and Joe Biden.","filename":"MGTOW","ext":".jpg","w":1200,"h":1200,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492805316440,"time":1492805316,"md5":"Kgr7WqBPPOVo9uC6lhxWFw==","fsize":249702,"resto":0,"id":"mfjnNo5w","country":"CA","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"mgtow-political-system","country_name":"Canada","replies":4,"images":1,"unique_ips":4},{"no":122178471,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)16:10:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122178291\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122178291<\/a><br>Bump<br><br>I&#039;m a MGTOW <br><br>This seems like a good idea to me","time":1492805411,"resto":122178291,"id":"X8SlIlxR","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122178692,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)16:12:00","name":"MGTOW with a Mensa IQ","com":"<a href=\"#p122178471\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122178471<\/a><br>I think it is. Our current system favors married couples over single people because they want to encourage couples to get married. Our culture makes it seem like you have to get married to be a real man or women. What they don&#039;t realize is that Chads don&#039;t care about finances, they are going to get married no matter what. I&#039;d even perfer a system where taxes on couples are higher because if the Chads get to live a life like that they should pay more.","time":1492805520,"resto":122178291,"id":"mfjnNo5w","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122178700,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)16:12:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122178291\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122178291<\/a><br><br>Autistic losers arguing that they should be in charge.<br><br>Sounds like feminism, desu senpai.","filename":"chad","ext":".jpg","w":1350,"h":2005,"tn_w":84,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492805524486,"time":1492805524,"md5":"rpBILbkbTxWb9EXBtevpAQ==","fsize":111520,"resto":122178291,"id":"aicEstCF","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":122178809,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)16:12:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122178291\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122178291<\/a><br>Mgtow is the only logical choice for men in the west.

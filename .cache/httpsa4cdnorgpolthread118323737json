He didnt won because he is intelligent though. He won because people were fed up of the corruption of the established people, being fed the same lies over and over again. Trump as an apparent outsider was the chance to change something and was the best shot for anyone who knew it doesnt matter wether you vote republican or democrat as they are both controlled by the (((same))) people. He could be a literal illiterate retard, and i still would have preferred him over clinton or bernie or cruz or anyone else except maybe for ron paul as he would have brought the chance that he would actually try to do something for the people and not only for (((them))). This small chance was more than enough for people to vote him. And i would take the most incompetent person who at least tries over some asshole with a stick up his ass who maybe knows how all the stuff in the government works, but only uses it to further (((their))) own agenda","time":1490506011,"resto":118323737,"id":"WfSBmXAQ","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":118324718,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)01:29:01","name":"Anonymous","filename":"image","ext":".jpg","w":2038,"h":2040,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490506141096,"time":1490506141,"md5":"w9jMSiF1bHvOLYYq6vWxbA==","fsize":544097,"resto":118323737,"id":"0SzOhqZF","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"}]}

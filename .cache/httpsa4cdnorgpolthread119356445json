They want to appease the mentally ill and tell them &quot;You are whatever you want to be, not as you&#039;re born!&quot; shit like that and people actually believe it. <br><br>WHY do I think this matters? Well, technically it won&#039;t directly harm me if any of my peers identify as something other than male or female but it means bad things for the future (long term)... and this is why I&#039;m against it.<br><br>What problem could 51 legally accepted genders, in my state (NY), pose? Well, I believe it will lead to an identity crisis.<br><br>Biologically you are born with your sex and race. Sex, age, and race, are part of someone&#039;s identity that cannot be changed (until recently, if you believe that). So. Now if I don&#039;t feel like a man my whole life, and FEEL like a woman, does that make me one? Society says yes, you could be a female. <br><br>So, society... let&#039;s say a man is born black and has grown up in a mostly white neighborhood (not that that really matters in the situation) and just never FELT black. He believes that he acts and thinks as a caucasian male. Do we as society have to now treat him as a white male? Can he and other person who feels that they identify more as a different race legally change it and be accepted? <br><br>Most people would be thinking NO, but if you truly believe someone can change their gender then why can someone not change their race? Would that not be hypocritical? <br><br>And to anyone who says &quot;well, it&#039;s different because you can&#039;t change your fucking race&quot; people have been saying that for hundreds of years about gender so not an argument.<br><br>Sorry for a long post, I&#039;ve just been thinking about it a lot. I feel sorry for those with gender dysphoria, and this was not made to hate even though I do not believe in more than 2 genders.","filename":"black-and-white-girls","ext":".jpg","w":410,"h":340,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":207,"tim":1491242246673,"time":1491242246,"md5":"\/QQtdFOF5vvR7PkWQ5p62w==","fsize":25460,"resto":0,"id":"vrm03kPg","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"argument-against-additional-genders","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":1},{"no":119356626,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)13:59:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"sorry for some retarded typos, first post of my own","time":1491242342,"resto":119356445,"id":"vrm03kPg","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

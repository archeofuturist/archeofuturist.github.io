When I say leftists I mean all of those stupid idiots advocating multiculturalism, diversity and such.<br>Because they don&#039;t reason like us, they seem to live in another world. Here&#039;s an example : https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=vUv<wbr>9pTG-9nU<br>This is the argument against le Pen and Zemmour. It shows that they hate immigrants because they had bad experiences with them in the past.<br>And this is it, it&#039;s enough. They just ROASTED them. Wow, we got&#039;em boys, they sure are losers, let&#039;s ignore everything they say now.<br><br>The &quot;comedian&quot; who made this is mistaken, because they don&#039;t hate the foreigners, they just want them out for good reasons, but the leftist see no nuance, in his mind it&#039;s the same, it&#039;s just hate. It&#039;s like when some people say that Napoleon invaded Europe because he had a little dick or that Hitler hated jews because his grandmother was one and she was rude with him. They actually believe that those little things in life make people create political parties or raise armies.<br><br>So are they just stupid? Because this mentality is really the same as one of a 12 years old obnoxious boy, you can&#039;t argue with it. How the fuck am I supposed to argue with kids? You can&#039;t reason with them because they will just destroy your argument with some buzz words like &quot;racist&quot; and stuff. Actually they don&#039;t even destroy it, they push it aside, they don&#039;t want to see it, it&#039;s like talking to a wall.","filename":"B6gQr5B","ext":".jpg","w":629,"h":623,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":247,"tim":1492872906994,"time":1492872906,"md5":"hoCOU3Q5ooKG\/tm1ZuI+rw==","fsize":86021,"resto":0,"id":"R\/ifnnrg","country":"FR","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"how-do-we-argue-with-leftists","country_name":"France","replies":7,"images":3,"unique_ips":6},{"no":122285054,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)10:57:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122284791\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122284791<\/a><br><br>The best way to redpill moderates is to argue in favor of liberalism in the worst way possible.","time":1492873056,"resto":122284791,"id":"wvQVwa7W","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122285136,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)10:58:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122284791\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122284791<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;How do we argue with leftists?<\/span><br><br>You don&#039;t.<br><br>Bring their arguments to their logical conclusions and let the spaghetti do its thing.","filename":"4f61b0a2ad2ebaaf6b8b7b0c0480961d0ce98b78a0130dc6958fca2583829fd5","ext":".jpg","w":638,"h":727,"tn_w":109,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492873099901,"time":1492873099,"md5":"Rj7aQ9qbSbEa7IW2iqns5g==","fsize":66337,"resto":122284791,"id":"+4owO5Dr","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122285513,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)11:01:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122284791\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122284791<\/a><br>good point","time":1492873316,"resto":122284791,"id":"eplFqkee","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122285822,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)11:04:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122284791\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122284791<\/a><br>Honest question: why do you consider their opinion in the first place?

As Jung wrote in Aion: Saturn, in astrology the &#039;star of the sun,&#039; is alchemically interpreted as black; it is even called &#039;sol niger&#039; and has a double nature as the arcane substance, being black outside like lead, but white inside. The Black Sun is pure potential energy, the pre-elemental element that the Otherworld consists of, and of which our own world is made through reflection upon its shiny black surface. It is the blank slate or black mirror into which the magician or alchemist projects his consciousness. As it is reflected back to him, his perception of it creates the illusory reality he lives in. This is why mirrors, and other reflective surface, like lakes and baths, were seen as portals to the Otherworld, as demonstrated in Jewish folk legends of the kingdoms of Lilith and Asmodeus, and also repeatedly portrayed in the films of initiate Jean Cocteau. By staring into the Abyss, you can see and then experience new ways of organizing the particles of the universe to create new realities. In this way, the Black Sun corresponds to the power of the &quot;Lord of the Earth,&quot; who, like Saturn, is said in myths to sleep in a hidden tomb at the center of the world, influencing surface reality with his dreams. Like Alice staring at the looking-glass, the creation of the Wonderland we live in occurs when Saturn sees his own projected image of his desired reality staring back at him from the Abyss, the dark mirror of the Black Sun. This is the meaning of the black orb seen in the palms of potentates the world over and from time immemorial. It is the &quot;regnum in potentia&quot; that they wield as their power, the word &quot;potential&quot; and &quot;potentate&quot; both being etymologically linked through the root word &quot;potent,&quot; meaning &quot;powerful and virile.&quot;","time":1493669579,"resto":123651552,"id":"B46CROLR","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123665876,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)16:13:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123651552\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123651552<\/a><br>love this picture","filename":"ayyyyyy","ext":".jpg","w":355,"h":528,"tn_w":84,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493669602993,"time":1493669602,"md5":"GNT6gk4t4rL88MLuk30G+A==","fsize":45846,"resto":123651552,"id":"Se4R9AAv","country":"CZ","country_name":"Czech Republic"},{"no":123665965,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)16:13:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123659944\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123659944<\/a><br><br>It&#039;s literally on video.

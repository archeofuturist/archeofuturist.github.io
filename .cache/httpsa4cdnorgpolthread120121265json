(((they))) have two options for him. (A) To get either rid of him by electing him out of the office or (B) to make him their puppet. Right now, it seems like he has chosen to become their puppet BUT<br><br>the Media loves him now,<br>Almost no damage has been done<br>Russia has been warned so Putin had time to get his soldiers out of there<br>Putin did not sacrifice them to get a reason for a war which means his also has no interest in starting a direct war<br>A lot of people don\u00b4t buy the whole gas attack bullshit. Their story about Iraq was better prepared than this bullshit. <br>It\u00b4s the media which decides who the people should love and who the people should hate. He knows that, you know that. <br><br>Trump made sure he will stay in office for a while longer. He chose to steer the ship right through the storm and we should not abandon him for that. <br><br>His hands might have been forced by (((others))) here but this was the only way to stay in power so he might do something right. <br><br>This was nothing but a firework show in the end so he can continue. We should be the ones who help him to get rid of (((those people))) who try to manipulate him by uncovering whatever we can. <br><br>The meme war might indeed by a cyberwar we fight under the banner of a frog. You decide if all you can do is to hunt down Shias flag or if you can save America and maybe even more. Who knows how much (((they))) want to destroy in the end.","filename":"chess","ext":".png","w":547,"h":345,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":157,"tim":1491651207565,"time":1491651207,"md5":"KtoFWP6vUEGfuKIg+S3ang==","fsize":400989,"resto":0,"id":"4j1XT6X7","country":"DE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"consider-this","country_name":"Germany","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

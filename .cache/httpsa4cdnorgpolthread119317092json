So, in a rich country like Japan, which has capacity to support 170 million people, when its population reaches 80 million, housing will be cheaper, the younger will have their parents money and other things they inherited. This younger generation with additional capital can be more prosperous than the older. They can thrive and finally succeed in achieve a good fertility rate that can sustain itself or maybe grow.<br>But for this to happen, it is absolutely necessary to abolish social security programs and lower the inflation.<br><br><a href=\"#p119327744\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119327744<\/a><br>Shut up leaf","time":1491226451,"resto":119317092,"id":"+VkIqOTb","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"}]}

While these judges are under oath to uphold the constitution and the rule of law, as long as they find the right interpretation of the case before them, they can lawfully convict or acquit pretty much at their leisure without facing any kind of legal or social repercussion. <br><br>Eurobros, is this common? If say, a Muslim migrant rapes a 14 year old girl in your country, films it, and then gets dragged into a court room only to testify that his ADHD prevented him from understanding the word &quot;no,&quot; will there be a jury of your average countrymen saying no, you&#039;re going to fucking jail?","filename":"1491104674016","ext":".png","w":1080,"h":1079,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":249,"tim":1492906032953,"time":1492906032,"md5":"ETbdD5k0asEClDRT+8kgGw==","fsize":674912,"resto":0,"id":"9wDZv5NR","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"after-doing-some-research-i-found-out-that","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":1,"unique_ips":2},{"no":122350375,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)20:14:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122349440\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122349440<\/a><br>Nigger don&#039;t even pretend like it&#039;s any better here when fucking trial lawyers write the laws and regulations and a business owner can&#039;t even take a shit in his own toilet without a proper inspection by 3 different agencies and several permits just so he is slightly less likely to be litigated and bankrupted by some kike because his insurance kikes found a loop hole to avoid payment because section 2 of article 5 said the seat must be oval but not so oval as to be less than circular.<br><br>Fucking legal systems are beyond despicable","filename":"1492813073943","ext":".jpg","w":951,"h":840,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":110,"tim":1492906496426,"time":1492906496,"md5":"zC5my7vYOadVFXim5ZSgYw==","fsize":92638,"resto":122349440,"id":"jRjV7o79","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

Wow, what a cuck! <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;You do know that Israel is our greatest ally and we have to do everything we can to destroy her enemies, right? Trump and Fox News said so!<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;So what if the President wastes millions of taxpayer dollars on golf? I don&#039;t mind that I&#039;m paying for a billionaire&#039;s luxury vacations, and you shouldn&#039;t either. After all, he&#039;s Making America Great Again\u2122! <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;We need to give more money to the military-industrial complex, having balanced budgets is for cucks! We also need to invest one-trillion dollars in infrastructure because more government spending will revitalize the economy!<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Islam is a savage religion. Muslims need to denounce every atrocious act committed by extremists! Oh, Christians in Africa executing gays? Well, um ... I hadn&#039;t heard about that. But the Qu&#039;ran is an inherently violent book - I mean, where in the Bible does God order mass slaughter and rape?<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Entitlement reform is for cucks. We just NEED to keep Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. If government didn&#039;t provide us with a safety net, we&#039;d all be dead! <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Other countries shouldn&#039;t be tempting me with goods of higher quality and better price than domestic manufacturers! If we simply banned all imports, we&#039;d be better off. After all, forcibly reducing competition is the key to economic prosperity.<\/span><br><br>Trumptards need their own containment board.","filename":"the_donald","ext":".jpg","w":750,"h":1000,"tn_w":187,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493435175512,"time":1493435175,"md5":"wgDWIER33YatmZaOoOodvQ==","fsize":77512,"resto":0,"id":"55oFFc4y","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"trumptards-need-their-own-containmend-board","country_name":"United States","replies":4,"images":0,"unique_ips":4},{"no":123287603,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)23:07:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123287445\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123287445<\/a><br>Not sure if you&#039;re a troll or a shill but either way, nice bait<br>you put a lot of effort into it and I&#039;m proud of you","time":1493435279,"resto":123287445,"id":"Aq9kEMSc","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123287727,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)23:09:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123287445\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123287445<\/a><br>he will not divide us<br>he will not divide us<br>he will not divide us<br>kys","time":1493435346,"resto":123287445,"id":"x3fEpAgA","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123287775,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)23:09:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123287603\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123287603<\/a><br>Not a shill.

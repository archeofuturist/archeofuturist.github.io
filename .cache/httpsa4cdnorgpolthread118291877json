Can it not stand on its own merit?<br><br>There&#039;s been millions of dollars spent censoring right wing thought online. Millions more on infiltration by private and government groups to sites like this to try to dissuade right wing thought.<br><br>Why is this?<br><br>99% of the television and print media is leftist, lefty, or globalist. Same with entertainment. Right wing comedy is impossible to find and right wing leaning comics are ostracized. Social media openly censors right wing stuff constantly. <br><br>The right has had none of this, 0, on its behalf. and still stands on even ground with the left. How could this even be possible?<br><br>There are people on this very board who are being paid to demonize right wing thought and demoralize those who adhere to it. <br><br>It&#039;s bad to gentrify black areas but good for blacks to diversify white areas.<br><br>Asians have their own countries, Africans have their own countries, but whites must be diverse.<br><br>Why is that?<br><br>Saudi Arabia doesn&#039;t take in immigrants. Why is that? Only Sunni Muslims ever win the immigration lotteries to come to Western nations.

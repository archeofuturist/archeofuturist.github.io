Have you evermetpeople? I don&#039;t mean just your friends or nice people you like. I mean loud pushy people who cut in front of you. Cheap people who never give a good tip. Nasty people who laugh when someone&#039;s in trouble. Well-meaning but dumb people who never show up on time because they always get lost.<br><br>Ok, the workers have seized the factory as a means of production and kicked out the bourgeoisie. Now what? We still need to decide what the factory will make, how much to charge for that thing, how much to pay the workers. Some people will still need to stand bent over a machine for 12 hours and some people will still need to have fancy lunch with clients - and we need to decide which is which.<br><br>So this is the point at which communism works in theory. If all the workers who seized the factory are well-meaning and clever and figure out which are the best products to sell and then divide the work and the money fairly, then communism works and everyone is happy. In theory. In practice, some people are sneaky and unfair and will try to get most money for least work. Some people are loud mouths and will insist the factory make some stupid product nobody will buy. Some people are dumb and can&#039;t do their work properly, even if they wanted to.","time":1490852355,"resto":118888707,"id":"iBDeMW9l","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118889477,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)01:40:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118888707\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118888707<\/a><br>Humans are greedy by nature.","time":1490852420,"resto":118888707,"id":"jyCRaSHM","country":"NZ","country_name":"New Zealand"},{"no":118889808,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)01:43:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118888707\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118888707<\/a><br>It&#039;s anti-Christianity.","filename":"gun-nun","ext":".png","w":1600,"h":1200,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1490852618351,"time":1490852618,"md5":"SEjd2I+pe7rnaCuiHFlGnw==","fsize":1103693,"resto":118888707,"id":"uLPXZu9K","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"}]}

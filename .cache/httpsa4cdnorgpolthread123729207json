The fact that they hide behind buildings and paper forms rather than come up to your door and just demand your money then and there?<br><br>I think paycheck deductions are a big part of how they&#039;re able to get away with it. When your money is gone before you even get it, it doesn&#039;t feel so much like theft. But if you ever become self-employed you&#039;ll be responsible for sending your own taxes to the government, and then the reality of &#039;taxation is theft&#039; will become more apparent.<br><br>What is there to be done about this?<br><br>The government controls the military, so armed insurrection appears difficult.<br><br>Perhaps we can start a TGTOW movement; taxpayers going their own way, where we move to countries away from these countries that are charging us taxes. This will prove challenging though because most foreign countries charge taxes as well, and many countries that don&#039;t charge taxes, like Saudi Arabia, are unpleasant for other reasons.<br><br>So what are your thoughts on taxation? Is it theft? If so, how do you cope with having your money stolen? If no, explain your reasoning.","filename":"taxation-is-theft-bumper-sticker","ext":".jpg","w":2048,"h":614,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":74,"tim":1493701009261,"time":1493701009,"md5":"UNLxhagOOK4X85FzcGlJew==","fsize":114474,"resto":0,"id":"P78VzGg1","country":"CA","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"taxation-is-theft","country_name":"Canada","replies":2,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":123729935,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)01:04:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"a constituional govt can run on taxes on goods<br>but you would have to have a sound monetary system with no federal reserve as well<br>our taxes just go to paying off the debt and interest","time":1493701486,"resto":123729207,"id":"LR8swmvp","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123730383,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)01:09:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"Its not theft if they retribute you with services, aka running water, streets, safety, etc. Depending on you the gov operates in your city.

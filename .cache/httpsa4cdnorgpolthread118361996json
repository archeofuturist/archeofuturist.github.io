The people who join Antifa, for example, aren&#039;t interested in fascism per se \u2013 they&#039;re interested in being able to smash up cars with crowbars, in beating people senseless, and in setting shit on fire with Molotov cocktails. If a genie gave them the power to do all of that without social and psychological consequences, I think they would. Because they can&#039;t, they re-frame their behaviour as resistance to oppression, in an attempt to make it justifiable.<br><br>If you focus on the way these people actually act, and forget all about politics for a moment, almost everyone would agree that certain behaviours are wrong. When you look at SJWs on Tumblr, for example, they are not nice people. On principle, being a snarky cunt, aggressively insulting people over simple disagreements, and forming pressure groups to get people fired from their jobs would all be frowned upon by society. Generally speaking, you can&#039;t behave like this and get away with it, because it doesn&#039;t fly with anyone. However, when you say you&#039;re doing it to some bad guys who deserve it, you get a free pass. Suddenly, it becomes a lot more acceptable, and other people actually join in, because they&#039;ve been suppressing this behaviour for years and they now have an outlet for it that won&#039;t result in them being excommunicated from society.","filename":"Antifa","ext":".png","w":1280,"h":1280,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490535410132,"time":1490535410,"md5":"ETteMV+VkbNRY4XIMMSlMg==","fsize":285315,"resto":0,"id":"i84XXldx","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"anyone-else-here-feel-like-the-sjw-movement-and","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":2,"images":1,"unique_ips":1},{"no":118362253,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)09:39:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118361996\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118361996<\/a><br>Antifa works the same way the fat people meme from recent years works, in that you take a group of people hated by society, and use them as a target for all of the frustration and anger you&#039;re not allowed to unleash anywhere else because it&#039;s not politically correct to do so. They can get away with more, though, because they appeal to people&#039;s hatred of fascism (read: Hitler, the most universally despised politician in all of human history). Punching people is wrong, but as long as you&#039;re punching a Nazi, it&#039;s all right \u2013 even though the books tell us that Based Adolf himself rose to power by ordering the Gestapo to kick the shit out of anyone who disagreed with him.<br><br>And I think this desire for confrontation ultimately stems from our programming as a species. We&#039;re inherently tribal. We don&#039;t take kindly to people who are different from us, and we&#039;re wired into conflict with groups that might pose a threat to our own. This used to be directed outwards, at people with a different skin colour, for example, who came from different parts of the world. But that avenue for aggression has been blocked, now, because of the racism bollocks. And so, the impulse manifests itself in a different way.<br><br>I don&#039;t know. I just got thinking earlier on and wanted to write it all out so I could follow along.

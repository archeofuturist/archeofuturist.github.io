Multiple strange coincidences occurred during these events. It was a pretty spooky affair. Internet outages, information mysteriously being deleted from servers and peoples home computers, and even more menacing things were intimated to have happened. Some people said that the key, or parts of the key to some wikileaks insurance files were indeed found but stopped cold. <br><br>Whenever this topic is brought up, it is usually heavily attacked. Attacked to a point that is a little strange. On some boards, discussions of this topic are flat out deleted or stifled one way or another.<br><br>https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/conspiracy<wbr>\/comments\/64m8hp\/summary_of_how_wik<wbr>ileaks_and_assange_were\/<br><br>http:\/\/archive.is\/Pj6Sl<br><br><br>The first link is a summary and timeline of this investigation which really helps to get an idea of the weirdness to this whole event. It also I think shows that there genuinely was something happening here and that it was not just a &quot;LARP&quot;.<br><br>The second link is an archived thread from endchan at a moment fairly early on in the investigation for the insurance key. <br><br>Do any of you guys have any info on this topic? Any good links for further info? Supposedly investigations are still happening underground and as far away as possible from government scrutiny as possible. Some people who were really paranoid from this even talked about it going off grid at one point in time. I honestly dont know. I just want any new info that might be out there. Please help if any of you guys can.","filename":"th6","ext":".jpg","w":286,"h":161,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1493887422925,"time":1493887422,"md5":"xfFHKaFqC2+1IW6TniDouQ==","fsize":12534,"resto":0,"id":"gX6q9wRo","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"wikileaks-blockchain-investigation-what-happened","country_name":"United States","replies":11,"images":5,"unique_ips":5},{"no":124041995,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)05:20:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"Man is there anybody out there with info?","time":1493889603,"resto":124039562,"id":"gX6q9wRo","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124042811,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)05:32:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124039562\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124039562<\/a><br>It&#039;s not uncommon in investigations for information to go missing like this.<br><br>It&#039;s like when the CIA was using narcotics agents to sell drugs to fund ops off the books.

Iran Contra was the tip of the iceberg. Interestingly enough, The Franklin Scandal also touched on the Iran Contra affair. Some of the laundered moneys were deposited at the Franklin credit union and Lawrence King was apart of a lobbying group supporting the Contras. The CIA ultra black stuff is probably untouchable, and is probably behind front groups of private company front groups. Like you said, they make money off of human trafficking\/drugs\/arms and other means to further the great enterprise.<br><br>This bitcoin blockchain investigation though really creeped me out.

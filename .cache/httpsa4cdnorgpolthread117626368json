In Austria, the leaders of the Austromarxism movement were &quot;virtually all&quot; Jewish and Jews played a &quot;central role&quot; in the failed November 1918 coup d&#039;\u00e9tat led by Egon Kisch and his Red Guards. During the German Revolution of 1918\u20131919 in the Weimar Republic, the Communist uprisings included Spartacus League members Rosa Luxemburg, Leo Jogiches, and Paul Levi, and Jews held indisputable prominence in its undertaking. The Bavarian Soviet Republic was headed by Eugen Levin\u00e9 and had in it a minimum of seven other Jewish commissars. In the 1930s Jews controlled a &quot;high proportion of the most sensitive positions&quot; in Hungary, Romania, and Poland, including the Party apparatus, state administration, and especially the Agitprop, foreign service, and secret police. During the Cold War, Jews, mostly from Eastern Europe, accounted for 40\u201350% of the American Communist Party&#039;s membership, and counter to the denial of American Jewish publicists, Jews played a &quot;disproportionately important role&quot; in Soviet and world Communism until the early 1950s.","filename":"3648219_orig","ext":".jpg","w":240,"h":252,"tn_w":119,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490105234723,"time":1490105234,"md5":"agw+XZGVZBgLXwdJrp+PGA==","fsize":15520,"resto":117626368,"id":"wMyCYKou","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":117626870,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)10:08:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117626748\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117626748<\/a><br>and what about the Jewish capitalist banks?","time":1490105314,"resto":117626368,"id":"VTV78EQt","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"}]}

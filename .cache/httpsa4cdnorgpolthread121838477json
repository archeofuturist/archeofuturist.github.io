The attack that is still ongoing to this day. Notice the rainbow fight club transformed the land of the brave into the land of courageous trannies squealing &quot;call me caitlyn&quot;? Of course color coded bullshit is just one layer of military deception. Crookedness of the rainbow is at heart of another similar phenomena - the hordes of crescents flooding the western world claiming some sort of &quot;landed gentry&quot; right to board it. So think of this rainbow-crescent duality as one phantom of the opera. Be very careful about asking nicely or telling firmly to follow any of the orders. Collective soul human centipedes are not exactly playing games. They were very clear with their warning issued on 1993: &quot;don&#039;t ask, don&#039;t tell&quot;. So if you&#039;re asking - you&#039;re asking for it. That was some sort of declaration of &quot;global WAR-ming&quot; activities. Notice it coincided with &quot;whats the frequency kenneth&quot; being issued to &quot;king of all media&quot; fake sattelite companies and other even stranger companies.","filename":"Tuhfet_Ul-Mulk","ext":".jpg","w":288,"h":440,"tn_w":81,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492606207635,"time":1492606207,"md5":"RHT3WAPGrCBfd2ghdR8C8A==","fsize":47886,"resto":121838477,"id":"3+QCuR0X","country":"LT","country_name":"Lithuania"},{"no":121840618,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)08:54:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"That&#039;s not a happening, you fat fuck.","time":1492606454,"resto":121838477,"id":"pdQAHQ4J","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"}]}

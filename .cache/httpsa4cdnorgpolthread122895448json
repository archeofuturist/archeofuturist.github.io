Better than a non-stem degree maybe, but I used to work alongside a lot of tradesmen at my last job and almost every single one could hardly walk. Their bodies took a fuck ton of abuse over the years. Then you have the unions to worry about, they only allow so many people in each year to keep the demand in the trade up so if you don&#039;t have an uncle or an &quot;in&quot; to get into one, good luck. Also, you cannot just &quot;learn&quot; a trade. You&#039;re going to need to fork over about $8000 - $11,000 to get into it. For example right now I work along aircraft mechanics. Just to get the school\/book work done is about $8000 and a couple of years, then to get your AMP license you need to take a course which costs $5000 and it has a test at the end which you can fail.","time":1493224257,"resto":122895448,"id":"1miO5snx","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122903141,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)12:32:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122901722\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122901722<\/a><br>why aren&#039;t you in a union?<br>her i live, we pay to a union, we get Christmas gift (a box of food) every year. pension, and ofc protected, so a company can&#039;t fire you, without legitimate reasons.<br><a href=\"#p122902353\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122902353<\/a><br>i really dont know, maybe electrician is a good pick.<br>Polacks are taking all the welders jobs. <br>Maybe housebuilding, but not a good idea to come from denmark to faroe island as a house builder to build houses, cause mostly all those houses get damage\/destroy when high winds are her.","time":1493224347,"resto":122895448,"id":"6\/DdAUT6","country":"FO","country_name":"Faroe Islands"},{"no":122903844,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)12:38:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122901387\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122901387<\/a><br>Faroe Island do have home rule, but we don&#039;t control foreign policy on some areas, one of them are rapefuges and immegrants.<br>the Socialist (that want to leave the danish kingdom) want to control foreign policy, so they can take rapefugees in.<br>im afraid that they will flood the country","time":1493224689,"resto":122895448,"id":"6\/DdAUT6","country":"FO","country_name":"Faroe Islands"},{"no":122903922,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)12:38:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"Personally believe it should be required to learn a trade in high school or before being accepted into college.<br><br>That would give skills to the unskilled and light a fire under your ass when you get to college if you don&#039;t enjoy trade work.","time":1493224722,"resto":122895448,"id":"Hdrpo4Cd","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122903990,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)12:39:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122898054\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122898054<\/a><br>What subapp are you using that doesn&#039;t show flags","time":1493224758,"resto":122895448,"id":"2rgXFzQv","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122904224,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)12:41:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122903844\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122903844<\/a><br>can I move there if I speak only english?","time":1493224881,"resto":122895448,"id":"SRr0Z6iK","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122904406,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)12:42:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;implying electrical engineering isn&#039;t a trade as well as an academic field<\/span><br><br>better luck next time, kiddo","filename":"pep","ext":".jpg","w":499,"h":499,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":124,"tim":1493224958503,"time":1493224958,"md5":"P2NCnCmDXshI86oCtCM19g==","fsize":24095,"resto":122895448,"id":"ZkdVB24y","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"}]}

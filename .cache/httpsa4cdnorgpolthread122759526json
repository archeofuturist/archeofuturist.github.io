I will say that while I do believe man DOES have some sort of involvement in the shift of weather, I think it&#039;s a rather negligible amount compared to whatever the Earth will do. Some places are growing warmer, some places are growing cooler, and this is rather consistent with Earth&#039;s climate history.<br><br>Environmentally, we should be encouraging countries with a bad record of cutting down their forests to preserve and replant them NOT simply for the &quot;hurr durr, gotta save the world&quot; or &quot;hurr durr, the oxygen&quot; arguments, but because without forests, it&#039;s easy for topsoil to be eroded and used up, and this actually does affect climate in a region.<br><br>I also think that fossil fuels are a good source of energy, but we should work to use cleaner variants or find ways to essentially &quot;scrub&quot; the waste product before it even leaves the energy facility. &quot;Clean&quot; energy sources are just as dangerous to the environment, if not more, as fossil fuels. Windmills can kill birds, hydro dams fuck up local ecosystems, and the production of solar panels produces some extremely toxic waste.<br><br>There&#039;s no right or wrong to dealing with climate change because in the end, it could be that we&#039;re not even responsible in a major way. If we want to address climate change, we mostly have to address Third World industrializing countries, which... is a problem, because these countries aren&#039;t concerned as much about the environment as they are about economic advancement.

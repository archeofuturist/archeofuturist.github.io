Germany was an occupied state! Their press was directly controlled by the American government, their governors were appointees of the United States. The German people underwent a sustained de-nazification program where they were taught to be ashamed of what they were. The EU was an American invention. Germany was an American proxy government. This was done to prevent De Gaulle, or Churchill from trying to steer their own course. The French always saw the EU and NATO for what they were, extensions of American Imperialism. Many Germans have lapped up US propaganda to the extent that many Germans actually think that the EU exists to challenge the United States rather than acting as a market for American companies.

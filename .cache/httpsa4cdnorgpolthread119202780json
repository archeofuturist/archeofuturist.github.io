News stations have been running stories that seem to be written by the Teachers Unions press release office on how this is going to turn out disastrous for the public school system because there is no accountability in the charter system! They don&#039;t even think there are going to be teachers available to teach!<br><br>http:\/\/www.wdrb.com\/story\/35042098\/<wbr>sunday-edition-who-will-teach-in-ke<wbr>ntuckys-charter-schools<br><br>Is there any data to show the success between charter schools and public school system?<br><br>KY obviously has a negative image in regards to education. I think this could be very beneficial. The public school system can be a leach. One of the largest public school system in the nation (Jefferson County Public Schools) is a disaster. They actively bus middle white children from the suburbs to go to school with the black kids regardless if it was an underperformed school. <br><br>Also, KY schools voluntarily elected to boost the dropout age from 16 to 18 years old when given authority by the legislature. That tells you there it really is all about the money.","filename":"Hot_For_Teacher_Van+Halen_single_478","ext":".jpg","w":478,"h":480,"tn_w":248,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491142286605,"time":1491142286,"md5":"esyVdk5TdbOtEXCiMPqxtQ==","fsize":52930,"resto":0,"id":"Aw79mxUS","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"kentucky-charter-schools","country_name":"United States","replies":7,"images":0,"unique_ips":6},{"no":119204858,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)10:33:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"Bump","time":1491143612,"resto":119202780,"id":"s2gXIH+k","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119205078,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)10:36:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119202780\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119202780<\/a><br>Up","time":1491143777,"resto":119202780,"id":"9jM0ruu7","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119205639,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)10:42:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119202780\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119202780<\/a><br>Fuck Shittucky and everything the nigger tyranny drug infested state has ever done.","time":1491144141,"resto":119202780,"id":"SVOFGgGq","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119205956,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)10:45:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119205639\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119205639<\/a><br>Produced the President of the CSA?","time":1491144356,"resto":119202780,"id":"Aw79mxUS","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119206089,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)10:47:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119202780\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119202780<\/a><br>token system when???

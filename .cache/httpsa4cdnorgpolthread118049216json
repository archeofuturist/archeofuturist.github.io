Many individuals remain in a 3\u20135 month developmental level, while others may appear to have near normal intelligence and development. Some children with lissencephaly will be able to roll over, sit, reach for objects, and smile socially. Aspiration and respiratory disease are the most common causes of illness or death.[14] In the past, life expectancy was said to be around two years of age. However, with advances in seizure control, and treatments for respiratory illness, most children live well beyond that age. With other advances in therapy, and the broader availability of services and equipment, some children with lissencephaly are able to walk with varying degrees of assistance and to perform other functions once thought too advanced.<\/span><br><br>I hope this little girl doesn&#039;t have much time left, but it doesn&#039;t sound people with this condition live into adulthood, i&#039;d be curious if anyone has hard numbers on the modern life expectancy for this.","time":1490341857,"resto":118049216,"id":"YfolsB1A","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118057829,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)03:51:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118055647\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118055647<\/a><br>How are they going to treat that?

Other than the thousands of people employed directly and indirectly in the manufacturing process, new techniques and patents are created to make these luxury items. Automobiles were once excessive luxuries like yachts, &quot;why have people make these fancy cars when everyone should be raising horses so everyone can have horses to work with?&quot; Or, &quot;Look at those fancy cars with dual channel stereo, air-conditioning, power seats, power steering, power brakes, and power windows, why can&#039;t these rich assholes do without and just let the companies make basic trucks and tractors... everybody goes out and works making food and towing shit.&quot; See that is the type of mentality that drives everyone back.

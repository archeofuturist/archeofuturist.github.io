Even tho Germany has a lot of political partys to choose from, it always ends up being either the CDU or the SPD. The other partys are nothinf but filler material to make coalitions with so they can form a group with the needed 50% of all votes. <br><br>So during the next elections in will either be Merkel CDU or Schulz SPD.<br><br>The people had enough of Merkel. They are tired of her migration politics. They will glad choose Schulz no matter what he offers. The coalition he will form has already been set. It is called R2G which means &quot;red-red-green&quot; . The most leftist group you can form. The greens and the SPD will bring us even more refugees if not the Sharia itself. The leftists will bring us Orwells 1984. All 3 of them want to allow every refugee to bring his entire family to germany by plane. The replacement of the remaining germans will go at full speed. The economy will thanks to the capitalism hating leftists crumble and this will effect even other European countrys. <br><br>Merkel will be replaced by Soros friend Schulz and this narcistic piece of shit will ruin what is left. <br><br>Has the AFD party any chance to win? No. Not until even the very last german has been a victim to the invaders. Not until &quot;surviving&quot; is all that has been left.","filename":"1efa606c1c06e80a3758dd132b340347","ext":".jpg","w":420,"h":309,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":183,"tim":1490465765814,"time":1490465765,"md5":"ptyPXEnJursr7RLRbUs3jg==","fsize":31550,"resto":0,"id":"tZWYQPom","country":"DE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"germanys-final-days","country_name":"Germany","replies":7,"images":1,"unique_ips":7},{"no":118252847,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)14:17:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"Is voting SPD wrong?","time":1490465853,"resto":118252671,"id":"APtOHrWh","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":118252928,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)14:18:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Has the AFD party any chance to win?

Also you don&#039;t have a right to my money. You also don&#039;t have a right to murder. Its a non-sequitur.<br><br>And I&#039;ll tackle one more. The RNC is correct when it says that abortions are funded by public money. Federal funds that are giving to Planned Parenthood allow them to reallocate money towards abortions. Of which they perform 300k plus. So even if the money comes with some sort of string attached to it where you may not spend it on abortions, you may (and planned parenthood does) instead spend it on other expenses and redirecting the funds intended for those functions to abortions. Think about it like this: your friend is an employed. He collects unemployment from the government. You feel bad about it, but you know that he likes to drink and go to concerts and that&#039;s haram. So you give him $500 a month on the stipulation that he can not spend it on drinking or on concerts, only essentials. He takes your $500, applies it to his rent, takes the $500 that was going to go towards his rent, and goes out drinking and goes to a bunch of concerts. You get mad, and he gets all smarmy and says &quot;LOL I didn&#039;t spend any more money on concerts!!!&quot;. That is what Planned Parenthood does with federal funds. So while it is correct that it is illegal to use federal funds on abortions federal funds allow Planned Parenthood to redistribute their internal financials in order to help accommodate abortions.","time":1492149089,"resto":121024821,"id":"t+7pN7ZA","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121025782,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)01:52:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121024969\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121024969<\/a><br><br>No you stupid nigger the biggest irony is how the left uses morality to argue law, then somehow flips and uses law to argue against morality. <br><br>Jesus fucking Christ pol I just hate left leaning parasites so fucking much.","time":1492149147,"resto":121024821,"id":"w7T8gMBu","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121025791,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)01:52:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121024821\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121024821<\/a><br>overwhelming majority of abortions are niggers<br>i have a hard time being against anything that kills niggers","time":1492149152,"resto":121024821,"id":"HeTtEZ2O","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121025793,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)01:52:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121024821\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121024821<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;banning abortion only bans safe abortion<\/span><br>You could apply this to anything.

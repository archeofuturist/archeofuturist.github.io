Syria has been Muslim for nearly 1400 years. There has never been anything like a democracy until very recently. Arab nations are more inclined to have dictatorships than democracy since it is a product of the West and not the East. Assad is a dictator in the accurate sense of the word. If anything Syria is a hereditary monarchy since Assad ruled after his father died. Yet, he is secular, and he is against ISIS. Globalism wants Assad removed and we have already seen what occurs when a dictator is forcibly removed. We get Libya and Iraq and a power vacuum for Islamic fundamentalists to get a grip. Secularism is the best possible chance for Syria which is why some here support him and his regime.","time":1491514750,"resto":119791586,"id":"0lNChZIS","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119799341,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)17:39:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119791586\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119791586<\/a><br>Against Assad?

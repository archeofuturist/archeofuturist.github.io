I just can&#039;t work out how to line up that tweet with anything remotely resembling reality.<br><br>Terrorism has killed millions. Literally millions. Over the past 17 years Islamic extremists have murdered hundreds of thousands of people in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, and smaller numbers in other middle eastern countries, Europe and America. And the chaos they&#039;ve caused has led to hundreds of thousands of more deaths through the proximate damage done to social cohesion and the economy. <br><br>Does he have any idea how badly places like Egypt, Tunisia and Turkey have been affected by Islamic terrorism? Turkey has suffered moderately, but Tunisia and Egypt have had their economies crippled by the loss of tourism due to terrorist strikes. The economic misery people are suffering through there would blow his tiny liberal mind. <br><br>Added to that the billions - literally billions of people across the world - who have had to deal with more powerful security services and constant fear as a result of terrorist attacks in their country.<br><br>And all this is stacked up against what? A few hurt feelings? What does he think &quot;Islamophobia&quot; has done to the majority of Muslims? Honestly, more than anything else the \/narcissism\/ of these people disgusts me. As if a Canadian or an American making an anti-Muslim statement on twitter must naturally make more of a difference to the life of the average Muslim than a few bombs going off, because, you know... obviously anything a white person does is more important that something a brown person does.","time":1492212458,"resto":121126026,"id":"WqWIBWA2","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121131771,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)19:27:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121131624\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121131624<\/a><br>Yes, except he doesn&#039;t care about the people as much as he claims.","time":1492212471,"resto":121126026,"id":"e0Lw56de","country":"EG","country_name":"Egypt"},{"no":121131896,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)19:29:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121126026\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121126026<\/a><br>Is this fake?<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;pls be<\/span>","time":1492212542,"resto":121126026,"id":"aC4fP2Sw","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121131942,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)19:29:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121131302\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121131302<\/a><br>Traitor.","filename":"1480275445974","ext":".gif","w":418,"h":480,"tn_w":108,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492212558966,"time":1492212558,"md5":"V4QSFuOKm1\/wxg517uqmLw==","fsize":1819091,"resto":121126026,"id":"jSdpLmCx","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121132027,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)19:29:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121126026\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121126026<\/a><br>Fake tweet.","time":1492212598,"resto":121126026,"id":"HDZHA8g1","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

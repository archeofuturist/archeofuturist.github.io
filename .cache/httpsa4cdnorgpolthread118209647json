Oh, that&#039;s right. The elections arent even over yet. In fact, only the exit poll is out. Does not having the lead at the exit poll count as a loss? Is that what you&#039;re saying? Because if you&#039;re saying that I can assure you that you&#039;re wrong. Why would you make this topic when the elections are still on? PVV are still getting votes right now and they have been the best political party for white peolpe in the Netherlands for how many years now? They&#039;re against one of the worst cucked political parties in this country who just happen to have a lead because they&#039;re feeding off the energy of turks and libtards in a thursday night election. But you know what? They still fucking suck. PVV are one of the best fucking political parties in the continent, they got 15 seats the last elections and would of won if cuck culture wasn&#039;t so popular. Maybe you should shut the fuck up before you make retarded topics like this. You know why? Because you&#039;re going to be embarrassed when PVV wins and someone bumps this topic. Oh look at that, VVD got only 31 predicted when they got 10 more the last elections. Are you a fucking drunk? Are you retarded? Are you autistic? You are a fucking idiot and you should never make a topic on this board again and I&#039;m fucking serious. I almost have a feeling you&#039;re the only guy making all these KEK topics because you&#039;re a faggot hater who doesn&#039;t like white people because they&#039;re good.

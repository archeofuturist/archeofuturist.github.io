It is necessary to examine the difference in reimbursement rate between medicare and private insurance. Finding data about this was hard. It&#039;s clear that private insurers won&#039;t get the same price for the same DRG (Diagnosis Related Group; a way of classifying hospital cases for the purposes of hospital billing) or CPT (Current Procedural Terminology; this is a classification originating from the AMA) or HCPCS.

Americans routinely spend anywhere from double to ten times the money on prescription drugs with respect to citizens in other countries.<br>2. Private insurers routinely pay between 1.15 to 2.35 times the medicare reimbursement rate for hospital and professional billing (52% of all medical expenditures).<br><br>And here&#039;s some napkin math to guess what various reforms might do:<br>1. Prescription drug reform - This is something president trump has mentioned.

Some arguments make a lot of sense, but there are questions which I can&#039;t figure out and I&#039;m can&#039;t find an answer for. Maybe some flatties on here could help me out.<br><br>- How do flat earthers explain the tides?<br><br>- When viewed from the Northern Hemisphere the stars appear to rotate in a counter-clockwise direction around a point directly above the North Pole, yet when viewed from the Southern Hemisphere the stars appear to rotate in a clockwise direction around a point directly above the South Pole. Why?<br><br>- Why does the moon appear upside-down in the northern hemisphere compared to the southern hemisphere? And on its side at the equator?<br><br>- Why does the south pole experience several days without the sun rising (polar-night) during winter and several days of total daylight without the sun setting beneath the horizon during summer (polar-day)?<br><br>- Why from the equator do the stars directly overhead appear to travel in a straight line while stars to the North or South appear to travel in curved paths?<br><br>- How do you explain the Aurora Borealis and Aurora Australis?<br><br>- What about the Cavendish experiment? Does it not prove gravity exists?<br><br>Thanks.","filename":"995625_10153097224666079_5100027453164879955_n","ext":".jpg","w":368,"h":538,"tn_w":171,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493232704401,"time":1493232704,"md5":"YruhC+WqKEA8Jdlkx4omhw==","fsize":85368,"resto":0,"id":"O+ieAA6G","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"questions-for-flat-eathers","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":19,"images":4,"unique_ips":11},{"no":122921907,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)14:58:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"no one?","time":1493233132,"resto":122921064,"id":"O+ieAA6G","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122922199,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)15:01:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"They can&#039;t answer you coz they&#039;re rewards and earth is a ball","time":1493233272,"resto":122921064,"id":"6ccGFBCn","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122922258,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)15:01:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122922199\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122922199<\/a><br>retards*","time":1493233301,"resto":122921064,"id":"6ccGFBCn","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122922561,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)15:04:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"Get out of pol nigger","time":1493233443,"resto":122921064,"id":"e1JzwcLQ","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":122922573,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)15:04:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"bump.","time":1493233444,"resto":122921064,"id":"O+ieAA6G","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122922617,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)15:04:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122921064\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122921064<\/a><br>Some things are only theories, like what causes the tides, but the rotation of the stars and almos everything you ask is explained in videos like the one of Eric Dubay.","filename":"CZXg0G5WEAEfh_1","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":600,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493233467707,"time":1493233467,"md5":"5wX44JLSfsk7dZYuirxHeg==","fsize":72807,"resto":122921064,"id":"j3YH0Ddd","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":122922659,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)15:04:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122922561\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122922561<\/a><br>Why?

All of Egypt&#039;s achievements are gone, of course, which means the Greeks and Romans will have less scientific knowledge to work with. Also gone is Christianity, since it&#039;s a branch of Judaism. No Christianity means no unifying force for Europe, which means no Catholic Church, which means nothing really holding Europe together culturally, which means more pointless wars.<br><br>We also have the problem that the Arabs were who maintained scientific and cultural knowledge after the fall of Rome. Without them to do that, Europe would have to rebuild everything the Romans and Greeks knew instead of retrieving the knowledge from the Arabs. It&#039;s impossible to guess how long that would take. We also have the difficulty of who becomes the moneylenders in medieval Europe, though that&#039;s a more minor point.<br><br>So skipping ahead and assuming these inventions are all somehow created anyway, no blacks to enslave in the Renaissance (when it most useful) means Europeans are either going to have to enslave each other or enslave Indians, Native Americans, and Asians. All of these would be very difficult, since Indians and Asians have advanced societies comparable to Europe and Native Americans could just run away (assuming they&#039;re used as slaves in the Americas). All in all, this probably leads to less advanced and efficient farming, manufacturing, and building.<br><br>All in all, 2\/10 world, would not live in.","time":1491865879,"resto":120507305,"id":"VW+VqUXy","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

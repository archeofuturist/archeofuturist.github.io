I don&#039;t actually know much about the subject desu. Still I only pay around 2% of my gross income for amazing healthcare, thanks to my local union. I get great dental, they cover my glasses for up to ~$250, and hospital stays are not a problem either. Was hospitalized for about 2 weeks and it was all covered. Feels good to be the jew sometimes.","filename":"IMG_0910","ext":".gif","w":501,"h":585,"tn_w":107,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493678402319,"time":1493678402,"md5":"21ILFAkB6vQutPHdZXVqwg==","fsize":11437,"resto":123666289,"id":"CrtKoavf","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123685079,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)18:41:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123666289\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123666289<\/a><br>to kill niggas","time":1493678487,"resto":123666289,"id":"PLqw3zqa","country":"MX","country_name":"Mexico"},{"no":123685130,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)18:41:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123683827\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123683827<\/a><br>Thanks anon<br>Ted seems well put together in this video<br>I would liked have heard Bernie&#039;s response but I doubt he could have an argument that could have stumped Ted anyway","time":1493678509,"resto":123666289,"id":"J0r6EAn7","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123685138,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)18:41:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123683940\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123683940<\/a><br><br>Because the insurance companies and pharmaceuticals have no real competition in the US.

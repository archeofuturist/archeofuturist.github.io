Humans thrive off of conflict. In third world countries, it&#039;s a struggle to stay alive; you are very clearly being forced to make an effort towards things, and you typically aren&#039;t given much time to contemplate life&#039;s mysteries as you&#039;re doing physical labor, which is in many ways like conflict, physical and sometimes mental exertion towards some goal, whether it be making your shack house, tending your subsistence farm, or hunting. In developed societies, there isn&#039;t any real conflict. Farming is massively automated, as is building, hunting is unnecessary for your wellbeing, and the knowledge that it&#039;s unnecessary takes a lot away from it. By and large, we don&#039;t have significant conflicts with our fellow man, and when we do, an outside force (laws\/government) steps in and takes over, settling or ending the conflict. As I said earlier, when people are kept away from conflict, they make it for themselves. This would typically show itself in say, neighbor-neighbor conflict or family feuds, the Hatfields and Mccoys being a prominent example. However, in modern society doesn&#039;t allow this. Law enforcement steps in and prevents the conflict from spiraling (generally). No conflict with nature, no conflict with man, so who&#039;re you going to fight? Yourself. Without some good conflict distracting it, your mind begins to turn on the people around you and yourself, resulting in depression.<br><br>Tl;dr nothing to struggle against means we struggle against ourselves. Also, a better education means we can better grasp our existential plight.","time":1492747104,"resto":122086393,"id":"lIbBh0r5","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122092718,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)23:59:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122092332\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122092332<\/a><br>If you can&#039;t further you&#039;re genes you should die.<br><br><a href=\"#p122092270\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122092270<\/a><br>I agree they deserve death, but I don&#039;t think the dead are looking for sympathy.

Bombing Assad is an absolute joke, especially when they can&#039;t prove any of the previous chemical attacks on him either.<br>It was the exact same situation as Obama was in when Trump was so vocally against it. There will be another (((chemical attack))) and Trump will escalate.","filename":"1491993225946m","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":683,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1492296870756,"time":1492296870,"md5":"iXku6IeXlSBXezr0g\/YYTQ==","fsize":102272,"resto":121258839,"id":"+7HB2p1f","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":121275396,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)18:56:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"A serious effort to topple Assad and\/or no wall by the 2020 election.

I&#039;m not talking about the wall or Syria, because it&#039;s minor in comparison. The taxes are absolutely ridiculous, the courts are ridiculous that they can do as they please. And on top of that he is not getting reelected if he doesn&#039;t stop voting fraud, which there is no indication of happening. What do I see? I see lots of talking and no action in any reasonable time frame. I want to believe, I do, but it&#039;s impossibly to do anything without upsetting some politician, and Trump the president is not willing to go there. He had no problem upsetting them as a candidate. So how do you call that?","time":1492297663,"resto":121258839,"id":"JTZq\/AKp","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

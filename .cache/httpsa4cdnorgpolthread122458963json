Or in general, the north-east edge of Philadelphia. <br>Why?<br>1. Since it&#039;s the city, there&#039;s far less taxes, better police, better EMS, and virtually everything. <br>2. Since it&#039;s the northeast, there aren&#039;t any minorities around. It&#039;s very nice and peaceful. Not too many Muslims (very few and don&#039;t go out much), and a good deal of Russian, Ukrainians, and Poles. Generally filled with Slavs, a handful of blacks, and the rest of the whites. <br>3. Good schooling, jobs easy to access. If you&#039;re going to commute to center city, there&#039;s many ways you can get to your job. <br>4. Really close to beautiful parks. Northeast has Pennypack park. Despite the bad rap Philly gets for being filthy, the section of the park past Roosevelt Blvd is clean and beautiful in spring Go during weekdays for less people. Many state parks nearby. <br>5. There are gun ranges, but they&#039;re spread out and you&#039;ll need to drive a bit. There&#039;s one or two in the Northeast, and gun shows are usually 30-45 min drives.<br><br>Really consider moving to NE Philadelphia or the suburbs there.

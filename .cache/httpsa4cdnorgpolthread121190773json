The notion that Christians are different from others primarily in their legal standing before God owes much to a traditional (Augustinian\/Lutheran) (mis)reading of Rom 7\u20138. The Pauline meaning of \u2018justifica- tion\u2019 is much broader and evidences a quite different eschatological orientation (see ROM 8). The word dikaioun (\u2018to justify\u2019; first used in 2:13 and then repeatedly throughout chs. 2\u201310) means literally \u2018to righteous\u2019; it comes from the same root as dikaiosun \u0304e, \u2018righteousness.\u2019 It means both \u2018to treat as righteous\u2019 and \u2018to make righteous\u2019 (K \u0308asemann 1980: 25). In other words, God both forgives sin and converts sinners in \u2018righteous- ing\u2019 the unrighteous. The relational character of righteousness (e.g. seen as God\u2019s faithfulness to Israel, above) covers both being established and being equipped as a fit partner in right relation- ship (e.g. in 8:2\u20134). The same point is made by calling the gospel \u2018the power of God for salvation\u2019.-OXFORD Commentary on Pauline Episles page 65","time":1492255080,"resto":121190773,"id":"BSz+8V1v","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121200228,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)07:20:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121198683\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121198683<\/a><br>Even inside a particular religions, there is a large degree of freedom and diversity of thought. However, it is important to define dogmatic beliefs just as it is important to define axiomatic propositions in any coherent system of thought. The &quot;question everythint, man&quot; mentality is why we have--as mainstream beliefs--the idea that two memebers of the same sex marrying is just as natural as two members of the opposite sex, or that claimin to belong to the opposite &quot;gender&quot; should be encouraged, even by pumping the person full of hormones and mutilating their genitals. If you want to deny dogmas, you can do so, but you need to dothat somewhere else. You can&#039;t claim membership of that religion at the same time and subvert it from within.","time":1492255203,"resto":121190773,"id":"okzK6ML8","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121200905,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)07:29:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121200088\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121200088<\/a><br>Liar, the entire lecture is based on primary sourced history and Vatican published works -- nothing presented in the video is sourced from fringe outlets or random books. <br><br>You straight up lied before even taking a look, Walter Veith is extremely reserved and coherent, and as I said, everything in the lecture is taken straight out of Vatican library sources and mainstream history\/academic circles.","time":1492255761,"resto":121190773,"id":"lWDv1MSY","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121201085,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)07:31:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121200905\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121200905<\/a><br>It isn&#039;t <br><br>I am sorry that all the early Christians contradict you<br><br>You can&#039;t even address what I took from the OXFORD BIBLE COMMENTARY AT ALL","time":1492255906,"resto":121190773,"id":"BSz+8V1v","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121201244,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)07:33:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121190773\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121190773<\/a><br><br>If people would just read the bible like a literature scholar (read whats there and critically think), they would find many answers to &quot;why doesn&#039;t God care&quot; or &quot;If God is all powerful, why does he let bad things happen?&quot;<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;tl:dr, He&#039;s answersing the question &quot;What is free will?&quot;.<\/span><br><br>We&#039;re in a period of non-interaction with God.

Although some scholars question whether or to what extent the diatribe was an established rhetorical form, there can be no doubt that diatribe style is present in Romans (Fitzmyer 1993: 91). At numerous points begin- ning in ch. 2 (also 3:1\u20139; 3:27\u20134:25; 9:19\u201321; 10:14\u201321; 11:17\u201324; 14:4\u201312), Paul addresses and even responds to the objections of an inter- locutor (most often with an impassioned \u2018By no means!\u2019 (m \u0304e genoito); 3:4, 6, 31; 6:2, 15; 7:7, 13; 9:14; 11:1, 11). The effect is to pull the reader into the \u2018conversation\u2019 on Paul\u2019s side. Rhetorically, the diatribe confers argumentative dynamism without ceding authorial control. It remains in the rhetor\u2019s power to choose what questions to ask and what answers to accept.","time":1492256562,"resto":121190773,"id":"BSz+8V1v","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121201940,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)07:43:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"Jesus was a bro, he knew what was good","filename":"1491250873213","ext":".jpg","w":2000,"h":1754,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":109,"tim":1492256593766,"time":1492256593,"md5":"kTAhRkR1\/3sl4EfKo2oLVQ==","fsize":3162748,"resto":121190773,"id":"IGqdn+Ex","country":"CA","m_img":1,"country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121202047,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)07:44:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121201480\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121201480<\/a><br><br>He didn&#039;t ask for a &quot;redpill on Christianity&quot;.<br><br>He asked a single question relating to the book of Genesis and the book of Job, complex but easy to summarize for someone unfamiliar.","time":1492256689,"resto":121190773,"id":"82An4BnE","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121202059,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)07:44:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121201940\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121201940<\/a><br>Too bad protestants can&#039;t even agree on his will and nature","time":1492256699,"resto":121190773,"id":"BSz+8V1v","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121202146,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)07:46:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121202047\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121202047<\/a><br>He wants the REDPILL on Christian<br><br>I give the best possible redpill to him<br><br>OXFORD BIBLE COMMENTARY","time":1492256760,"resto":121190773,"id":"BSz+8V1v","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121202208,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)07:46:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121202146\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121202146<\/a><br>Let your baptism be ever your shield, your faith a helmet, your charity a spear, your patience a panoply.

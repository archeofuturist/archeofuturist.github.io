The notion that Christians are different from others primarily in their legal standing before God owes much to a traditional (Augustinian\/Lutheran) (mis)reading of Rom 7\u20138. The Pauline meaning of \u2018justifica- tion\u2019 is much broader and evidences a quite different eschatological orientation (see ROM 8). The word dikaioun (\u2018to justify\u2019; first used in 2:13 and then repeatedly throughout chs. 2\u201310) means literally \u2018to righteous\u2019; it comes from the same root as dikaiosun \u0304e, \u2018righteousness.\u2019 It means both \u2018to treat as righteous\u2019 and \u2018to make righteous\u2019 (K \u0308asemann 1980: 25). In other words, God both forgives sin and converts sinners in \u2018righteous- ing\u2019 the unrighteous. The relational character of righteousness (e.g. seen as God\u2019s faithfulness to Israel, above) covers both being established and being equipped as a fit partner in right relation- ship (e.g. in 8:2\u20134). The same point is made by calling the gospel \u2018the power of God for salvation\u2019.-OXFORD Commentary on Pauline Episles page 65","time":1492255080,"resto":121190773,"id":"BSz+8V1v","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121200228,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)07:20:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121198683\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121198683<\/a><br>Even inside a particular religions, there is a large degree of freedom and diversity of thought.

You&#039;re comparing apples and oranges. The Mercator is a conformal projection and a brilliant one at that. Angles are preserved and rhumb lines preserve their anngles against meridians which makes it great for navigation.<br><br>The Peters (actually Gall&#039;s work) is an equal-area map and not a particularly good one at that either. Area is preserved but shapes are only true at the places you chose as standard parallels, which suspiciously enough in the Gall-peters it is 45 as seen from his formula. He chose a map that preserves shape near his home country - so much for his third world love.<br><br>For those interested, other equal-area projections exist, some of them quite tasteful. Once you give up on making them pseudocylindrical you get some very elegant projections such as Alber&#039;s conic and Eckhart&#039;s even numbered maps (especially IV). Pic is a heart-shaped equal area map (Cordiform Werner) based on the Bonne projection.<br><br>Generally speaking there are no &quot;wrong maps&quot; just wrong uses of maps.

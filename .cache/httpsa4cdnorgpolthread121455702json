Dunkirk was a morale disaster. The &quot;miracle&quot; was that England didn&#039;t surrender right after. They got stomped, but were able to retreat because a lot of British mariners came together to get their boys off the mainland. Once those mariners saw German boots on British soil with guns pointed at their families, they would capitulate so fast the jokes about surrendering would be about French and British. At that point in time, their economy was still in shambles, though they were working on getting the kinks out, and their supplies were questionable. If a single division had been put on British soil, they would cowered and surrendered like most other times foreign boots have hit their island.<br><br>The Battle of Britain, was folly. Not because of the fight, but because of the targets. Ports and drydocks were the main thing supporting their Navy. And the Navy was the only thing keeping German boots off the island. Navies are great, but mean dick if you can&#039;t keep them supplied and reinforced. Bombs without boots have never caused a people to surrender. Just pissed them off.<br><br>And as far as Egypt, that was just complete retardation. Focusing south was not going to get them around the Royal Navy. It was another front that German was flailing about doing a whole bunch of nada. There wasn&#039;t enough oil to feed the German warmachine in Africa, and their weren&#039;t going to be able to circumvent the Royal navy by going south. It was stupid. Only thing they were hoping for was to get the Italian navy out of the Med so that they could take the fight to the English. And just a ounce of brain cells to process how bad the Italians were losing on EVERY front would have told you, best not to spend good resources on bad gambits. Every soldier, civilian, part, plane and bullet should have been focused on the North Sea. Bust through and you land like the fucking vikings up and down the eastern coast. Britain collapses. Most of their industry is across the north.

Keep in mind, Stalin couldn&#039;t even take Finland a couple of years before. Yes, the Soviets were reforming their army and it would have improved, but without the pressure of the German invasion it wouldn&#039;t have improved nearly as much as it did in real life (because in real life it was forced to improve). Stalin would probably would have had trouble just trying to invade Poland, and then Hitler could have moved in in the guise of being Poland&#039;s defender.

With CRISPR technology, we may soon be able to simply replace the bad genes and help all of humanity. I personally see nothing wrong with gene therapy being used to fix things like Trisomy 21 or other genetic disorders, most babies that are diagnosed with them are aborted and I find that extremely sad. But if we can use this tech to eradicate nigger traits as well, we have a bright future.","time":1492488680,"resto":121634638,"id":"PvwdYPQx","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121636381,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)00:16:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"I would assume the damage occurs too early in trisomy 21 to fix it with CRISPR-CAS9. The biggest problem is that it is only ~95% accurate for exicision. That 5% adds up damn quick on a full genome.

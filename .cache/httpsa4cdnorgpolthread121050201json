I&#039;m personally on the left, but it still didn&#039;t take me long to see that TYT weren&#039;t the most objective individuals, I saw they&#039;re very left and twisted stories in their mind to fit their narrative, but hey, a lot of people do that and a lot of news organization do that. But today is when I truly lost respect for them. <br><br>I wanted to see what TYT would think of the recent terror attack in Stockholm<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;type in stockholm truck TYT<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;wasn&#039;t expecting them to call it a terrorist attack, before it was completely confirmed<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;nothing comes up<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;hmm.jpg<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;go directly to their youtube channel and go back a week<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;fucking nothing<\/span><br><br>They didn&#039;t report on it, they willfully ignored it, that&#039;s actual evil right there. I would never expect TYT to not try to dance around the fact that it was a muslim, but to never even report on it, disgusting. The worst part is, it took a while before we got our suspect, they could&#039;ve reported on it and truthfully said, &quot;we do not know the perpetrator or his motives&quot;, but no. They weren&#039;t even going to give their audience that, they weren&#039;t going to risk their narrative. You know why? Because deep down the fucking knew, they fucking knew that the driver would be Muslim, they fucking knew that it would be connected to ISIS, and still they pull the mental gymnastics to say, &quot;durhur not all muslims, be tolerant guys durhur&quot; yet they live in a world where they can accurately predict that a random truck attack was made by a muslim and be correct.<br><br>The worst part? They just covered a story 7 hours ago about an Ohio boy who got in his mother&#039;s van and attempted to drive to McDonalds, not one was hurt, no collision happened. <br><br>This is news worthy to TYT, but stockholm wasn&#039;t, think about that.","filename":"young-turks","ext":".jpg","w":1138,"h":700,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":153,"tim":1492169685112,"time":1492169685,"md5":"rERPOjOettqk+osekTISGg==","fsize":253388,"resto":0,"id":"62E\/EpJb","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"thats-it-im-pissed","country_name":"United States","replies":6,"images":0,"unique_ips":6},{"no":121050387,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)07:37:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"Lost you at &quot;but I always respected them to an agree&quot;","time":1492169826,"resto":121050201,"id":"J61DTxXK","country":"LK","country_name":"Sri Lanka"},{"no":121050450,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)07:37:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"meh i don&#039;t watch them so it doesn&#039;t really matter to me either way","time":1492169874,"resto":121050201,"id":"LSEiyOpu","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121050613,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)07:40:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121050201\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121050201<\/a><br>and you think its only TYT doing this?","time":1492170005,"resto":121050201,"id":"ONRN73X+","country":"BG","country_name":"Bulgaria"},{"no":121050791,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)07:42:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"NYT 2017: This wave of European terror attacks has seemingly come out of nowhere","time":1492170140,"resto":121050201,"id":"LSEiyOpu","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121050908,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)07:43:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121050201\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121050201<\/a><br>They have always been shitty biased ideologues.<br>It always amazes me to see liberals complain about Fox news and then watch these guys who are ten times worse.","time":1492170218,"resto":121050201,"id":"ii0HomC\/","country":"AR","country_name":"Argentina"},{"no":121051842,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)07:55:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"I&#039;ll never understand these people.<br><br>Even here.

I know it&#039;s funny to shit talk &quot;the normies&quot; but if they aren&#039;t red-pilled to the events happening right in their backyard nothing&#039;s going to change.<br><br>We need to, right here, and now address the &quot;University Problem&quot;. We need to make something quick and palatable that can quickly explain to the senior, and Junior high-school classes and parents that College is corrupt. Begin encouraging trade school instead of university (I know a few of us are teachers). We need to go after the wallets of the Universities, and finally somebody get Trump to tweet something mean about universities. Didnt he say he&#039;d defund Berkeley if shit like this happened again? We need him to call out the Liberal arts and get people thinking about it.<br><br>It&#039;s fun to bash the media, but trump used them to his favor. We need to as well while the time is nigh. It&#039;s clear Trump or his cabinet frequent this site. Time to use his power for good. We have to... and when he does. Everybody who&#039;s in a liberal arts university or college make their voices heard to the staff. No more being a silent conservative. make the staff KNOW we mean business and agree with him, and if they kick us out, we have proof of why, and a final crushing blow to the universities. it will prove how horrible they are. if they dont kick us out, we will be subject to intolerant liberals also making them look bad for attacking normal, peaceful students.

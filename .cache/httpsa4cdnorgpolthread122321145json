We need to make something quick and palatable that can quickly explain to the senior, and Junior high-school classes and parents that College is corrupt. Begin encouraging trade school instead of university (I know a few of us are teachers). We need to go after the wallets of the Universities, and finally somebody get Trump to tweet something mean about universities.

It&#039;s clear Trump or his cabinet frequent this site. Time to use his power for good. We have to... and when he does. Everybody who&#039;s in a liberal arts university or college make their voices heard to the staff. No more being a silent conservative. make the staff KNOW we mean business and agree with him, and if they kick us out, we have proof of why, and a final crushing blow to the universities. it will prove how horrible they are. if they dont kick us out, we will be subject to intolerant liberals also making them look bad for attacking normal, peaceful students.

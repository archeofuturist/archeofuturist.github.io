He imports a lot of (literaly millions) of immigrants from our &quot;Mexica&quot; into our country, substituting indeginous population. He is not rightist, because he is against the market and is a convinced governmentist. Indeed, he is a neoliberal, who pumps resources out of our country and then sends the money back (in the form of his closest friend, who holds their capitals on the West)). <br> You, West, can wash him out just for one day (through blockig SWIFT and total prohibitions on Putin&#039;s closest (and richest) friends). But you don&#039;t do that, neither in Spain, nor in UK, you want our resources and money. Because you support the robbery of my people, because Putin are doing just what the West&#039;s Elite want from him. He is a US state department agent. <br> You government fooled you to get more money on the weapons. <br> Here you can ask me any quetions about Russia.","filename":"14698073259940","ext":".png","w":1959,"h":1959,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":249,"tim":1493057854990,"time":1493057854,"md5":"QHTmIBk\/ShDtwB9yZWgMfA==","fsize":100241,"resto":0,"id":"aVIBBKgT","country":"RU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"russian-here","country_name":"Russian Federation","replies":107,"images":29,"unique_ips":48,"tail_size":50},{"no":122617691,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)14:19:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122617495\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122617495<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;memes are real<\/span><br>kys","time":1493057944,"resto":122617495,"id":"3luxupk\/","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":122617902,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)14:20:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;in the form of his closest friend<\/span><br>friends* <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;You government<\/span><br>your*","filename":"14806486502180","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":600,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493058047604,"time":1493058047,"md5":"VYdOtXEKhxTVw3iBXVtwiA==","fsize":50397,"resto":122617495,"id":"aVIBBKgT","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":122617922,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)14:21:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"putin and the west are equally bad, both need to hang","time":1493058061,"resto":122617495,"id":"vZxNYvPK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122618045,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)14:21:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122617495\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122617495<\/a><br>Shut up, you Jewhovah Witness","time":1493058109,"resto":122617495,"id":"FeIzLrVb","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":122618225,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)14:23:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"Haven&#039;t you ever thought, why in Russia we have more then 100 billionaires, while having the size of economy comparable to Brazil or Spain?","filename":"14832111290920","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":513,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":106,"tim":1493058196255,"time":1493058196,"md5":"rqq9exeUJ5F1ro4VeMnPGw==","fsize":181407,"resto":122617495,"id":"aVIBBKgT","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":122618382,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)14:24:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122617495\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122617495<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;because he is against the market and is a convinced governmentist<\/span><br>Circa 2012 \/pol\/ is that way, proxyrussian.

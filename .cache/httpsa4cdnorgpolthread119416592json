I have written a book called The Foundation for Exploration in my spare time (I&#039;m a full-time neet) and I would really appreciate it if you could give it a read.<br><br>-It is pol&#039;s book. It has some very serious and groundbreaking ideas regarding the origins of a lot of emotions that a typical pol user may go through. Wrath, depression, madness, and hedonism all stem from powerlessness. In order to alleviate this powerlessness, you need courage, self-control, wonder, and humor. You also need collective organization because there are deeply entrenched society-wide problems that one man cannot defeat. That is why we need a full-scale revolution of our society. I believe my book can be a cornerstone of a revolution because it has a strong philosophical basis. Pol can be a strong cornerstone of this revolution.<br>-I dive into sexual dynamics in pol-fashion. Men need to cultivate masculinity and not be cucks, yet not be overly animalistic and women must cultivate femininity and not be roastie whores (shouldn&#039;t pursue hedonism and the animalistic nature of man) I go into this in great detail and explain that strong families are the provider of great happiness and power, and they come from a balancing of the two spectrums I call the Power and Animalistic-Artificial Spectrums. <br>-The focus of the brave new society I create is to inspire wonder back into people, with a bringing back to nature and in the end a focus on exploring the cosmos. The economics calls for cooperation between people, superseding the focus on profits and rigid structure.<br><br>WE MUST START A REVOLUTION.<br>This is not an advertisement, the book is free. I will commit seppuku like Yukio Mishima if this thread does not succeed in starting the beginnings of a revolution.","filename":"earth and moon","ext":".jpg","w":984,"h":984,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491272071082,"time":1491272071,"md5":"vlR2UpJgVH3bs0ztXaDYLA==","fsize":203020,"resto":0,"id":"744NH42w","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-foundation-for-exploration","country_name":"United States","replies":41,"images":8,"unique_ips":14},{"no":119416791,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)22:16:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119416592\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119416592<\/a><br>PRAISE GOONAN AND THE FOUNDATION","time":1491272180,"resto":119416592,"id":"I03qy3re","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119416998,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)22:18:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"Gas the kikes","time":1491272301,"resto":119416592,"id":"L8upsARp","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119417015,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)22:18:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;buy my book goy<\/span><br><br>Nah","time":1491272309,"resto":119416592,"id":"1VleKtFG","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":119417237,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)22:20:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119416592\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119416592<\/a><br>You know something Goonan I remember you made a thread awhile back so I checked your book out.

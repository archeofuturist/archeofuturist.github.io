the exam&quot;, i would make 2-3 years long, one could start to take lessons at 15-16 and by the time he reaches 18 he should be able to drive a car and not just be a danger on the road, also once you&#039;re over 65 you should be examinated once a year if you&#039;re still able to drive, got tire of picrelated doing 50 in a 90 zone","filename":"vecchio

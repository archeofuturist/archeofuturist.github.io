This has only been a thing for 16 years, since Bush 43. It never happened prior to his administration, and as a matter of fact Gorsuch is the FIRST nominee for SCOTUS to ever get a filibuster. <br><br><br>http:\/\/volokh.com\/2013\/03\/13\/on-jud<wbr>icial-confirmations-history-and-num<wbr>bers\/<br><br>You can still use a filibuster on legislation or anything else. The Democrats opened Pandora&#039;s box in 2013 and now they forced McConnell&#039;s hand. Anyone blaming the GOP for what happened is a retard and a shill.","filename":"1491577241019","ext":".png","w":545,"h":517,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":237,"tim":1491586735513,"time":1491586735,"md5":"XLOPzXGVjNbGj1c17Luf8A==","fsize":276196,"resto":0,"id":"usG1+Ywe","country":"NL","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"republicans-did-not-destroy-200-years-of","country_name":"Netherlands","replies":7,"images":1,"unique_ips":5},{"no":119989363,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)13:42:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"So trying to filibuster a Supreme Court nomination isn&#039;t destroying tradition but blocking them from doing that is?","time":1491586939,"resto":119988807,"id":"EnH4HdSM","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119991176,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)13:52:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119989363\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119989363<\/a><br>How on earth did you get that from my post?","time":1491587572,"resto":119988807,"id":"usG1+Ywe","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":119991428,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)13:54:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119989363\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119989363<\/a><br>retard","time":1491587653,"resto":119988807,"id":"Yrly7623","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119993276,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)14:05:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"Bump","time":1491588325,"resto":119988807,"id":"usG1+Ywe","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":119993747,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)14:08:11","name":"Anonymous","filename":"1423423289374","ext":".png","w":853,"h":454,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":66,"tim":1491588491146,"time":1491588491,"md5":"YGHXPes64J33U7ckQcSYUw==","fsize":194354,"resto":119988807,"id":"Yrly7623","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119995655,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)14:19:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119988807\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119988807<\/a><br>bump","time":1491589143,"resto":119988807,"id":"3WzlH73d","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119996006,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)14:20:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119988807\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119988807<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Democrats are retards<\/span><br><br>More news at 11!","time":1491589257,"resto":119988807,"id":"qnNKTm7P","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"}]}

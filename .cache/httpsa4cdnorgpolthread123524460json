I thought that was really nice of him and started to wonder how I should refer to him - either Herr Hitler or Mein F\u00fchrer. It wouldn&#039;t make much sense to call him my f\u00fchrer, since I&#039;m estonian and it would be kinda awkward to refer to him as Herr Hitler. Anyway I don&#039;t really remember if the dream continued or ended with that.<br>So I guess I&#039;m asking you did this dream have a deeper symbological point or was it just random?","filename":"18033448_1839397369718628_8332568950888005452_n","ext":".jpg","w":480,"h":639,"tn_w":187,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493585346437,"time":1493585346,"md5":"\/oEt2T0gSF+MDhGpG6eEzQ==","fsize":77576,"resto":0,"id":"4CmZfLoQ","country":"EE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"dreamt-of-hitler-today","country_name":"Estonia","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":123524704,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)16:50:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123524460\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123524460<\/a><br>nice, add it to the blog.","time":1493585459,"resto":123524460,"id":"fRpUnPQs","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

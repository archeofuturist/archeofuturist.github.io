I&#039;ve had people arriving in the eleventh hour at the wrong polling station, or they have insufficient ID, so they couldn&#039;t vote. I&#039;ve seen ballots tossed out for being unclear - voters are only suppose to select one candidate, and they do so by making an x in the white sphere beside the candidate&#039;s name. If we can&#039;t tell which sphere the x is in, it gets tossed out. Check marks are suppose to be accepted as long as it is clear, but I bet some polling stations throw them out - there are supposed to be volunteers from every party to scrutinize us but there is often none or just one, and they aren&#039;t suppose to touch the ballet but one time a Liberal HELPED count and the DRO didn&#039;t stop him and all I did was watch him like a hawk - it was a Liberal landslide district so a few votes wouldn&#039;t have made a difference, but still...<br><br><br>Oh, in addition to voting, you should really volunteer to be a scrutineer for your political party.","time":1492689805,"resto":121983933,"id":"86K7UgxF","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]}

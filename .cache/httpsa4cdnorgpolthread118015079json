So you think Muslims have paid a price? Not even fucking close.<br><br>Historical price:<br>From the late 19th century onward, European Colonial powers have spent *considerable* resources initiating the Zionist project. The colonial powers, mainly UK literally collapsed pushing it through. This included finding suitable locations for Israel in places like Argentina, Central Asia and Ottoman Turkey, capturing land, overthrowing nations, mass relocating wealthy Jews, purchasing property, building the foundations of the new nation amid an unsuspecting population, bribing off dozens of neighboring and local governments in the process.<br><br>Price in Blood:<br>Overthrowing the Ottoman empire<br>Two World Wars <br>Arab-Israeli wars<br>Gulf Wars<br>War on Terror, now expanded to Syria<br><br>Price in Dollars:<br>To this day, Israel requires billions in funding each and every month, just from the US. This is not including the much larger private support which comes from all over Europe, Soviet Union and Middle East.<br><br>Price of maintaining the neighborhood:<br>What? you think Jordan, Egypt, Saudi, Iran to some extent are playing nice now because they forgot their enemy? Fuck no. This is the result of trillions of dollars of investment, bribery, blackmailing to get them to play nice with Israel. <br><br>The real price is infuckingsane. This is what Israel has cost us so far, along with pretty religious war with Muslims thrown in for all our efforts.<br><br>Was it worth it?","filename":"1af[1]","ext":".jpg","w":890,"h":890,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490317051230,"time":1490317051,"md5":"xppxOuCW9CFv6BY6RcsFAQ==","fsize":148646,"resto":0,"id":"CtvC8Atk","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"true-cost-of-creating-funding-maintaining-and","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":4,"images":4,"unique_ips":2},{"no":118015640,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)21:02:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118015079\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118015079<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Was it worth it?<\/span><br><br>Madagascar plan all the way.","filename":"original","ext":".jpg","w":809,"h":425,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":65,"tim":1490317320942,"time":1490317320,"md5":"1MTVw8kJbNmP04yopnMjJw==","fsize":90557,"resto":118015079,"id":"LZ3Xcc5k","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118016264,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)21:06:45","name":"Anonymous","filename":"1445741543305","ext":".jpg","w":520,"h":521,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490317605264,"time":1490317605,"md5":"F8\/DTOIPZAVl0kmP+0bUEw==","fsize":50756,"resto":118015079,"id":"CtvC8Atk","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118018014,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)21:20:05","name":"Anonymous","filename":"1484439133194","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":600,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490318405920,"time":1490318405,"md5":"XdA+bwqeq2eIqPyzydUhNQ==","fsize":66419,"resto":118015079,"id":"CtvC8Atk","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118018397,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)21:23:08","name":"Anonymous","filename":"syria-isis-backers-1","ext":".jpg","w":871,"h":668,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":95,"tim":1490318588863,"time":1490318588,"md5":"eS5r7v9eqzy43+WT+44RvQ==","fsize":172423,"resto":118015079,"id":"CtvC8Atk","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"}]}

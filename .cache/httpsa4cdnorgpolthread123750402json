By matching low-relief carvings on some of the pillars at G\u00f6bekli Tepe to star asterisms we find compelling evidence that the famous \u2018Vulture Stone\u2019 is a date stamp for 10950 BC \u00b1 250 yrs, which corresponds closely to the proposed Younger Dryas event, estimated at 10890 BC. We also find evidence that a key function of G\u00f6bekli<br>Tepe was to observe meteor showers and record cometary encounters. Indeed, the people of G\u00f6bekli Tepe appear to have had a special interest in the Taurid meteor stream, the same meteor stream that is proposed<br>as responsible for the Younger-Dryas event.

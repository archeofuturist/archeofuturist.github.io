According to Arthur Jensen and J. Philippe Rushton the black-white IQ difference is largest on those components of IQ tests that are claimed best to represent the general intelligence factor g.[46] The 1996 APA report &quot;Intelligence: Knowns and Unknowns&quot; and the 1994 editorial statement &quot;Mainstream Science on Intelligence&quot; gave more or less similar estimates.[47][48] Roth et al. (2001), in a review of the results of a total of 6,246,729 participants on other tests of cognitive ability or aptitude, found a difference in mean IQ scores between blacks and whites of 1.1 SD. Consistent results were found for college and university application tests such as the Scholastic Aptitude Test (N = 2.4 million) and Graduate Record Examination (N = 2.3 million), as well as for tests of job applicants in corporate sections (N = 0.5 million) and in the military (N = 0.4 million).[49]&quot;","time":1490353993,"resto":118063761,"id":"nzyn9TVt","country":"DK","country_name":"Denmark"},{"no":118070480,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)07:16:11","name":"Anders Munch","com":"<a href=\"#p118069834\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118069834<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;but what do you mean by this?<\/span><br>I line up the experiment in this essay, but for women.<br>http:\/\/archive.is\/dBehg<br>Also, see pic.<br><a href=\"#p118067181\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118067181<\/a><br><a href=\"#p118069834\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118069834<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;if you&#039;re talking about using already made tools &amp; materials and assembling a house, they can do it, there&#039;s 100% owned &amp; operated indigenous construction groups that do build homes and other things<\/span><br>That is swell, then the experiment should be done.

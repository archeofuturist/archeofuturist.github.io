The answer depends on the number of polymorphisms used to define that dissimilarity, and the populations being compared. When they analysed three geographically distinct populations (European, African and East Asian) and measured genetic similarity over many thousands of loci, the answer to their question was &quot;never&quot;.&quot;<br><br>And how to prove it with real life experiments? That is easy. The australian aboriginals have been evolving isolated from rest of humanity for 25.000-40.000 years.

Given, that Assad was not supposed to have them after saying they were disposed of. <br><br>Assad lost control of a majority of his chemical weapons since a majority of the country was sacked.<br><br>This intel was leaked to Russian listening posts manned by Syria army intel agents through non-encrypted transmissions, making it look like low level communication.<br><br>The site of the chemical munitions were then scouted and confirmed by plain clothes operatives before the strikes were made.<br><br>Detonation caused some of the chemical weapons to activate and release gas into the surrounding area. The munitions were purposefully housing among civilians who were semi-prisoners by circumstance.<br><br>After the first bombing some rebels attempted to evacuate the intact chemical weapons to a hospital that was actually a staging point for rebel operations.<br><br>Most of the people claimed to be suffering from chemical exposure in photos appear to be suffering from head trauma and waterboarding which was progressed to the state of drowning.<br><br>This was a deep state operation to pivot military action and US posture to further the globalism agenda through population replacement and disruption of stable nation states in Europe. This is also part of the upcoming greater Israel agenda.<br><br>Trump is falling into an intel trap and the deep state is reigning him in to a controlled state with propaganda. <br><br>Things are getting extremely dangerous and the end goal is to instigate a world war with Russia so that a population culling can begin.","filename":"friendly ghost","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":400,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":156,"tim":1491436352375,"time":1491436352,"md5":"u6hoCgzSipKKu+0vQHoz0w==","fsize":24299,"resto":0,"id":"HBmVMWvO","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"cia-us-intel-gathered-on-syrian-rebels-indicated","country_name":"United States","replies":4,"images":0,"unique_ips":5},{"no":119675829,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)19:55:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"Oh shit","time":1491436525,"resto":119675553,"id":"ScADg+Mn","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119676160,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)19:58:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"Shit","time":1491436710,"resto":119675553,"id":"fjsOYtHp","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119676234,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)19:59:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119675553\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119675553<\/a><br>Do you have the source on that OP","time":1491436750,"resto":119675553,"id":"iumz\/8AG","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119676312,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)19:59:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"shiet","time":1491436794,"resto":119675553,"id":"6rnzNkBP","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

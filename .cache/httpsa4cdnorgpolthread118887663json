The University has told the man they will use &quot;eminent domain&quot; and condemn his property and just out right take it if he doesn&#039;t accept their offer. The dude is 70, and worked all his life to retire in that area, and now some shitty second tier college is going to bully him out of his land because they have government affiliation.

The other crazy thing about this is the building they want to expand from is on another organizations land that they lease to them for cheap and there is more land around that area owned by the other org.

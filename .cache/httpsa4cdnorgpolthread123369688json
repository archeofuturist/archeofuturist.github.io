You all used to be the bastions of the meme war, but now your the bastards. It&#039;s like this fucking place has lost all its fighting spirit since Trump won. I have never seen anything like it before. Trump&#039;s victory should have fucking united us even more against the left and made us stronger.<br><br>Instead, the infiltration or whatever the fuck is going on has happened, and it somehow has worked and convinced a lot of you to hate Trump. This is fucking madness. I see the same threads over and over again, and the same posts over and over again. It&#039;s so obvious what is happening. It&#039;s so obvious the enemy has infiltrated us, yet we are just blindly following along.<br><br>There have been many attempts to subvert our goals and thoughts in the past, but never before has it been on such a wide scale and actually has worked before. This is fucking seriously terrifying. You all need to snap out of this fucking shit. There&#039;s a god damned Civil War on the horizon, this is no time to be fucking fighting each other. This is like a fucking proxy war.<br><br>The most terrifying example of us being fucked up now is the fact that these fucking Leftist agents or Shareblue or whatever they are CONSTANTLY bring this up:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Trump has not done anything he promised to do in the 100 days he&#039;s been in office<\/span><br>AND YOU ALL FUCKING AGREE AND GO ALONG WITH IT.<br><br>If this was the old \/pol\/, then I would be seeing the following, valid, true argument, but I have yet to see anyone say it...

Members of the Revolutionary Workers League assaulted students and shoved them aside in order to seize DIA\u2019s microphone and harangue the crowd gathered at the rally. This followed a pattern of disruption of DIA organizing by the Revolutionary Workers League.<br>As socialists, we condemn the actions of the Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action By Any Means Necessary and the Revolutionary Workers League (RWL). The Revolutionary Workers League\u2019s actions in no way reflect socialist values and contribute nothing to social change, \u201crevolutionary\u201d or otherwise. The Revolutionary Workers League, both under that name and its National Women\u2019s Rights Organizing Committee (NWROC) name, has a history across the United States of similar disruption and undermining of progressive coalitions.<br>We call on all socialists and left-minded individuals of principle to reject the tactics of the Revolutionary Workers League and the Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action by Any Means Necessary.<br>Militant socialist values can and must be promoted with respect for the broad progressive movements. There is no room in the left for the sabotague and disruption that has been too common a characteristic of the Revolutionary Workers League.<br>As members of the left, we are committed to supporting progressive change and our allies fighting for affirmative action.","time":1492847423,"resto":122188065,"id":"6KtKlsII","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122252703,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)03:56:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122188065\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122188065<\/a> (OP)<br>This list looks pretty legit guys!","filename":"ZAP THE COMMIES TO THE EXTREME","ext":".png","w":461,"h":136,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":36,"tim":1492847797990,"time":1492847797,"md5":"\/0yXBMwcZ6MTfHFDoj5V1Q==","fsize":20411,"resto":122188065,"id":"tS8FohSv","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122252870,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)03:59:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;122252619<\/span><br>KEK","filename":"5c8b75bac6","ext":".png","w":379,"h":421,"tn_w":112,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492847948824,"time":1492847948,"md5":"ublqawNV8BVvQGLLHLEAOg==","fsize":6187,"resto":122188065,"id":"jvPnWqNN","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122253224,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)04:05:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"Bump","time":1492848300,"resto":122188065,"id":"4jNKL8yw","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122253812,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)04:14:06","name":"M","com":"<a href=\"#p122253224\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122253224<\/a><br>8ch has uncovered a ton on this as well.

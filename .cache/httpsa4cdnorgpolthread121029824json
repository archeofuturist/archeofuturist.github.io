Is this it? I thought we&#039;d at least hold hands or something, but we just wind up having a regular conversation like we&#039;re on a really bad date. Hesitantly, I ask the main question on everyone&#039;s lips: Will Trump be a horrific president?<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Vanya stares into the middle distance like a cashier trying to figure out exactly how much to short you on your change. (Apparently this is what communing with the dead looks like.)<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;Not many people believe that Trump will be a good president,&quot; she eventually responds. &quot;At the beginning people will be negative, but in the end he will put things in the right place and America will be very happy with him.&quot; It&#039;s not the answer I was expecting, nor does it seem remotely likely, but whatever\u2014who am I to argue with a dead Bulgarian lady?<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Also, Trump will serve two terms.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Next up: Brexit. Should we be worried? &quot;Brexit is not a bad thing for England,&quot; Vanya responds. &quot;It will be hard for two years and then the third year will be very good for England. We will be very strong.&quot;<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;It strikes me that, for a dead lady, Baba Vanga is very right-wing and reactionary and xenophobic. For example, when I ask Vanya to ask Baba about the threat from ISIS, she dismisses it and tells me that the real threat is from unchecked immigration.<\/span>","filename":"1491722527281","ext":".png","w":600,"h":580,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":241,"tim":1492152191551,"time":1492152191,"md5":"bsMjM911THH8MBjzHcaBkg==","fsize":368672,"resto":0,"id":"8mNusxQr","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"vice-triggered-by-racist-ghost","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":1,"unique_ips":1},{"no":121029863,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)02:43:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"part2<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;This country has to be more careful with immigrants who come from other countries,&quot; says Bulgarian-born Madame Vanya\/Baba Vanga.

Is this Vanya or Vanga talking? Revisiting my biography of Vanga later in the day, I notice that everyone in the book is white (to be fair, the book&#039;s in black and white so it&#039;s hard to tell.) Maybe it is Vanga talking, after all. Could it be that Vanga, beloved baba of Eastern Europe, really is a racist?<\/span>","filename":"1479318242440","ext":".jpg","w":352,"h":351,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":124,"tim":1492152224881,"time":1492152224,"md5":"6+lHTZwtoMDhXWaN98ivMg==","fsize":46488,"resto":121029824,"id":"8mNusxQr","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

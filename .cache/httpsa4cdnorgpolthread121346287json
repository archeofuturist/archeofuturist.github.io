I&#039;m not saying I agree with capitalism, but the unequal system of capitalism had no conflict. Marxists introduced class-struggle into the working man&#039;s vocabulary, but it never stuck, because people were happy.<br><br>The general public were taught that the upper class wasn&#039;t some magic place full of hardworking people, but was a cesspool of human sin; they realized they were socially equal to the rich upper class. That&#039;s what changed. <br><br>When any human being knows he is equal to someone, he contests that equality to find out whether he&#039;s alpha or beta in the relationship. Children love to play fight; they grow dominance skills that way; that&#039;s how our chimp cousins establish dominance. <br><br>America is one of the most violent places on Earth now, because there&#039;s these systems in place telling us that we&#039;re all supposedly equal. We&#039;re seeing that equality being contested every day by race riots, wallstreet protests, etc; institutions of inequality are faced with egalitarian rhetoric, and it&#039;s causing problems.","filename":"Equality Logo March 2016","ext":".jpg","w":916,"h":899,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":245,"tim":1492339716468,"time":1492339716,"md5":"UYHgWeZp20kTA\/LD9NeczA==","fsize":99011,"resto":0,"id":"ifOnficc","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"inequality-doesnt-cause-conflict-equality-does","country_name":"Canada","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":121348017,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)07:15:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121346287\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121346287<\/a><br>absolutely not true. Keep in mind that CIA lemon party gestapo globalized the world and established equality taliban apartheid where even war equals peace, freedom fries rapidly into tar like substance of slavery, ignorance equals strength and of course equality equals inequality. Meaning behind any label pervertariat flushed down that toilet of equality that they erected in the slime house. Toilet so equal that it&#039;s more equal than toilets for the rest of us - normal, straight not crooked people.

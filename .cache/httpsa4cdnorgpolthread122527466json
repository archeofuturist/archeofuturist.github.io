This was back when resources were important to familial survival. Marriage for love is a stupid modern bullshit concept; Jordan &quot;sort yourself out&quot; Peterson even says that people who marry for love are doin&#039; it wrong.<br><br>Marriage was first performed by the upper class for the above purposes, and was then enforced among the lower classes because one woman to one man is an optimal strategy for maintaining public and social order.

Not morals, oh no. Social order has to become threatened, the economy has to become unstable, and women have to become more vulnerable. Before, a single mother was fucking screwed; now she can live off of the state. So, will this happen? Will society reach a point where women become so vulnerable that marriage and monogamy becomes &quot;hip&quot; for them? I can&#039;t say for the Western Hemisphere, but Europe it may. Things in Europe are getting so bad, some massive outbreak of conflict started by the muzzies and nationalists just might be the tinder to cause another continental conflict.<br><br>And then there is what I consider the part of marriage we as citizens can fix ourselves: law.

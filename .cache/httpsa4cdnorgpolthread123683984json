Bible scholar R. C. Sproul comments: &quot;What&#039;s interesting in the expression is that Jesus specifically mentions the right side of the face [Matthew 5:39]....If I hit you on your right cheek, the most normal way would be if I did it with the back of my right hand....To the best of our knowledge of the Hebrew language, that expression is a Jewish idiom that describes an insult, similar to the way challenges to duels in the days of King Arthur were made by a backhand slap to the right cheek of your opponent.&quot;<br><br>The principle taught in the Sermon on the Mount in Matthew 5:38-42 would thus seem to be that Christians should not retaliate when insulted or slandered (see also Romans 12:17-21). Such insults do not threaten a Christian&#039;s personal safety. The question of rendering insult for insult, however, is a far cry from defending oneself against a mugger or a rapist.<br><br>http:\/\/home.earthlink.net\/~ronrhode<wbr>s\/qselfdefense.html","time":1493679287,"resto":123683984,"id":"23KO8Ev6","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123687038,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)18:56:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123684196\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123684196<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I am a christian.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;But I&#039;m also a white-supremacist<\/span><br>Those are contradictory positions.<br><a href=\"#p123684982\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123684982<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;interpreting that passage this incorrectly<\/span><br>He was saying &quot;you niggas gonna be hated for doing the dumbass shit I&#039;m telling you to do.

Most people want to earn their salvation to the point of sacricing their own children. They will become very upset when you tell them that what they did to earn their salvation was actually evil and pointless in the eyes of god.

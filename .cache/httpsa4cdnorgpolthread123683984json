Bible scholar R. C. Sproul comments: &quot;What&#039;s interesting in the expression is that Jesus specifically mentions the right side of the face [Matthew 5:39]....If I hit you on your right cheek, the most normal way would be if I did it with the back of my right hand....To the best of our knowledge of the Hebrew language, that expression is a Jewish idiom that describes an insult, similar to the way challenges to duels in the days of King Arthur were made by a backhand slap to the right cheek of your opponent.&quot;<br><br>The principle taught in the Sermon on the Mount in Matthew 5:38-42 would thus seem to be that Christians should not retaliate when insulted or slandered (see also Romans 12:17-21). Such insults do not threaten a Christian&#039;s personal safety. The question of rendering insult for insult, however, is a far cry from defending oneself against a mugger or a rapist.<br><br>http:\/\/home.earthlink.net\/~ronrhode<wbr>s\/qselfdefense.html","time":1493679287,"resto":123683984,"id":"23KO8Ev6","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123687038,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)18:56:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123684196\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123684196<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I am a christian.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;But I&#039;m also a white-supremacist<\/span><br>Those are contradictory positions.<br><a href=\"#p123684982\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123684982<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;interpreting that passage this incorrectly<\/span><br>He was saying &quot;you niggas gonna be hated for doing the dumbass shit I&#039;m telling you to do.

Most people want to earn their salvation to the point of sacricing their own children. They will become very upset when you tell them that what they did to earn their salvation was actually evil and pointless in the eyes of god. They unwittingly follow Lucifer believing he is god and they might try to kill you when you redpill them about it.","time":1493680225,"resto":123683984,"id":"XMYb6Rgs","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":123688718,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)19:10:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"National socialism is not christian, duh.","time":1493680228,"resto":123683984,"id":"gemQHl2z","country":"HU","country_name":"Hungary"},{"no":123688794,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)19:11:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123686840\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123686840<\/a><br>Christianity is turning the other cheek.<br><br>Catholicism is bending the knee.","time":1493680269,"resto":123683984,"id":"CYu6DPu2","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123689299,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)19:15:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123686842\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123686842<\/a><br>i see that it bothers people alot to realize that Jesus was very similar to \/pol\/ of his time<br><br>meek Jesus is a lie<br><br>He was a powerful, masterful debater, teacher, and leader<br><br>He espoused gaining power from within in contrast to forcing power from without which is what Judaism did with their Talmud and endless rules<br><br>Jesus believed in self defense, he did not require us to be martyrs and never taught that<br><br>http:\/\/biblehub.com\/kjv\/matthew\/18.<wbr>htm<br><br>3And said, Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven. 4Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven. 5And whoso shall receive one such little child in my name receiveth me. 6But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea.<br><br>children are not violent by nature, they will however defend themselves if attacked no matter how weak they are<br><br>and Jesus will open a can of whoop ass on those that worship Moloch or believe in child marriages and slavery and hurt them","time":1493680526,"resto":123683984,"id":"23KO8Ev6","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123689508,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)19:17:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123686791\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123686791<\/a><br>I&#039;ll be sure to mention you said that when your life is on display and your soul is being judged by God.","time":1493680635,"resto":123683984,"id":"ln96Rqgh","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123689704,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)19:18:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123683984\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123683984<\/a><br>Jesus also died for my sins.

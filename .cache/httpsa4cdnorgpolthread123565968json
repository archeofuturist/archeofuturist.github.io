For years, the QIIP was run in parallel to the federal IIP. Both schemes most recently required applicants worth a minimum of C$1.6 million to loan the respective governments C$800,000 for five years, in return for permanent residency visas. The federal IIP was shut down last year, but the lucrative QIIP continues.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The QIIP is of major significance for the distant west coast city of Vancouver, since federal data shows 89 per cent of Quebec investor migrants have actually ended up living elsewhere in Canada; if these are dispersed in the same manner that federal investor migrants distributed themselves, then about 60 per cent of all Quebec investor immigrants likely ended up in British Columbia. It is an act of deception that has cost BC billions in IIP loans, that have instead gone to Quebec. Freedom of movement, guaranteed under Canada&#039;s charter of rights, makes it almost impossible to halt the practice.<\/span>","time":1493606845,"resto":123565968,"id":"OLHesg0J","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123567210,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)22:47:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123565968\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123565968<\/a><br>They are far more anti-semitic than any anglosphere country,<br><br>They don&#039;t have &quot;xir\/xem&quot; genders as we know them.

Every friend she&#039;s tried to make has betrayed her in some way or another, and when my parents have told her they wouldn&#039;t be good friends she hasn&#039;t listened and learned the hard way. This piece of shit she&#039;s been with for 4 years is 26, only has a GED, no car or driver&#039;s license, lives with his grandma, and has been between jobs more times than I can count. Every time he saves up a decent amount of money &quot;for a car&quot; something mysteriously happens to it (&quot;oh his brothers needed it, his mom needed it&quot;) and my sister has been his taxi ever since the relationship started. Neither of them take care of her car, which is trashed, and probably worth less than she owes on it. On top of that his stomach is destroyed from being a dumbass when he was young and drank liquor every day on an empty stomach, giving him ulcers and making him a wimpy piece of shit. Because my sister has him, she has lost control of herself: She doesn&#039;t take care of her body (is obese, stereotypical fat white girl with a nigger), disrespects my parents, and takes advantage of their generosity.

She knows that although my parents have tolerated it for so long, neither will accept marriage with this guy, so I don&#039;t know what she plans to do.

There has to be consequences to coalburning. That&#039;s a larger problem with society these days. Nobody is willing to put their foot down and impose penalties to anything. And therefore, all behavior becomes permissible. Fuck a nigger? Have 3 kids out of wedlock with a separate father for each? Nobody is willing to put their foot down. It&#039;s all this &quot;judgment free zone&quot; bullshit. And it incentivizes people to get away with shit behavior. And hell, that includes the NEETs who get away with just spending their time jobless and watching anime and playing vidya all day, because their parents are too chickenshit to put their foot down and make their son get a job.","time":1491264628,"resto":119395014,"id":"ei55CDe\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119402897,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)20:12:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119402359\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119402359<\/a><br>I won&#039;t lie I have issues in some regards but this is the only board I browse on this site because it&#039;s politics, free speech and it&#039;s anonymous.

For thousands of years, your ancestors have been able to have plenty of kids with each generation. People during the great depression were basically living on the streets and without work or money everywhere, and even they were still able to raise families. But god forbid if anyone in the modern era even THINKS about having children without already having paid off the 30 year mortgage on the house and without already having stocked up enough money for their college education.<\/span><br><br>It&#039;s about lifestyle.<br><br>Having kids nowadays as a white person severely hampers your lifestyle simply because whites are already paying a disproportional amount of taxes so that brown and black people can get welfare. Tack on a kid or two and your ability to go to fancy restaurants and drive a decent car is completely gone.<br><br>Instead of drinking on the weekends and having free time you&#039;re basically resigned to work and raise the next generation of wage slaves.<br><br>At least if you avoid having kids you can enjoy the good years of your life without having to worry about getting divorce-raped and losing the only part of you that you&#039;d end up caring about.","filename":"1464543826538","ext":".jpg","w":201,"h":199,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":123,"tim":1491264899604,"time":1491264899,"md5":"nP9rHntEDGDBU\/NXS326KA==","fsize":12695,"resto":119395014,"id":"QS+6NBDs","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119403313,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)20:16:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119401430\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119401430<\/a><br>It&#039;s called preselection. Married men are automatically more attractive to women, because the mere fact that you&#039;re married means another women thought you were good enough to settle down with. It&#039;s a known fact that you can go to a bar with a ring on your finger and all things being equal, you will have more success just because they see you&#039;re married. <br><br>Whenever I see\/hear shit like this, I have such mixed feelings. On one hand, it fucking kills me inside that there are these hordes of white women doing this permanent adolescence bullshit thinking they can party it up consequence-free well into their 30s, because I see them making huge mistakes with their lives that will result in them not having any children. But on the other hand, I can&#039;t help but feel a smug sense of satisfaction that these dumb whores will get everything they deserve. <br><br>The silver lining is that this behavior acts as a soft form of eugenics. The conservative women who actually have morals and values end up not being whores and settling down and having tons of kids. The liberal commie feminist &quot;liberated&quot; cunts jump from cock to cock until they&#039;re old and busted, end up as cat ladies, and die childless. So while it sucks that it overall means less whites breeding, at least the ones who ARE having kids are the higher quality whites.","time":1491265006,"resto":119395014,"id":"ei55CDe\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119403585,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)20:19:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119403146\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119403146<\/a><br>This is an argument for hedonism.

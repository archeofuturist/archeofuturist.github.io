Almost all foods have sugar in them. Fast food is cheap, tasty and convenient. There is a culture that thinks eating crap food is no big deal. In addition to that the country is set up for driving. In Europe most people are forced to walk at least 30 minutes a day. That counts as exercise. <br><br>Also niggers. Niggers are fat. Niggers commit crimes so public transportation is not really an option. You also can&#039;t live in cities so you live in the suburbs and drive. Also niggers don&#039;t pay for ER and other things. So the people that do pay, pay an inflated price to compensate for free loaders. <br><br>Obama introduced a lot of bureaucracy and inefficiencies. So in addition to paying for the doctors you pay for a lot of paper pushers that don&#039;t add any value. <br><br>Lawsuits. People like to sue for malpractice. <br><br>Schooling is more expensive in America. It&#039;s expensive to train a doctor to graduate to the standards required. <br><br>Like someone else said, Research and Development of drugs, medical equipment and other such things cost money and is supported by the americans. Europeans don&#039;t invent shit, they just take the medicine at a much lower cost. <br><br>Solution: make medical care cheaper and humans healthier. How? get rid of niggers and spics that don&#039;t pay for it and are fat anyway. Get rid of Obamacare. If you can&#039;t afford medical care just die! Get rid of the lawsuits and paper pushers. Create incentives so that people pay for what they use so it&#039;s not overconsumed. Tax the rest of the world for R&amp;D. Lower the standards to graduate so if you get treated for a broken nail it doesn&#039;t cost a fortune (increase supply). Have competition between hospitals and doctors. <br><br>In short it&#039;s very easy to fix it. But explaining to the population that not everyone deserves to live and have access to healthcare is hard.

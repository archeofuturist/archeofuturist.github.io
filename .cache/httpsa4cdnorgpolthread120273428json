Their brothers, sisters, parents, friends, and neighbors who did not serve in the military are often just as familiar with those weapons, if not the tactics. Today the AR-pattern rifle (the semi-automatic civilian version of the familiar full-auto-capable M-16 or M-4) is the most popular model of rifle in America, with millions sold in the past decade. Firing the high-velocity 5.56\u00d745 mm cartridge and mounted with a four-power tactical sight, a typical AR rifle can shoot two-inch groups at one hundred yards when fired from a steady bench rest. That translates to shooting eight- to ten-inch groups at four hundred yards.<br><br>Four hundred yards is a long walk. Pace it off on a straight road, and observe how tiny somebody appears at that distance. Yet a typical AR rifle, like those currently owned by millions of American citizens, can hit a man-sized target at that range very easily, given a stable firing platform and a moderate level of shooting ability.<br><br>And there are a far greater number of scoped bolt-action hunting rifles in private hands in the United States. Keep this number in mind: based on deer stamps sold, approximately twenty million Americans venture into the woods every fall armed with such rifles, fully intending to shoot and kill a two-hundred-pound mammal. Millions of these scoped bolt-action deer rifles are quite capable of hitting a man-sized target at ranges out to and even beyond a thousand yards, or nearly three-fifths of a mile. In that context, the 500-yard effective range of the average semi-auto AR-pattern rifle is not at all remarkable.","time":1491753382,"resto":120273428,"id":"maf4Qo7E","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120297337,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)11:59:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120282798\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120282798<\/a><br>The laws on stills tend to be pretty strict though.","filename":"barker_hermit","ext":".jpg","w":215,"h":291,"tn_w":92,"tn_h":124,"tim":1491753558675,"time":1491753558,"md5":"33H5tHUbueN\/Lff3taihwQ==","fsize":32980,"resto":120273428,"id":"PMuMyZiv","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120298070,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)12:05:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120281671\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120281671<\/a><br><br>what is insulation?","time":1491753929,"resto":120273428,"id":"UHBCTshO","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120298156,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)12:06:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120273978\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120273978<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;living in a polar bear&#039;s asshole<\/span><br>How about you come to the suny side?","filename":"IMG_20170324_181814","ext":".jpg","w":1728,"h":3072,"tn_w":70,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491753968008,"time":1491753968,"md5":"H3NAZ8Ec7Xhl95VdPeTJRA==","fsize":1303346,"resto":120273428,"id":"b0bu+r7E","country":"AR","m_img":1,"country_name":"Argentina"},{"no":120298907,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)12:12:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120296985\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120296985<\/a><br><br>this scenario would be like hell on earth in large sections of the US all those fucking guns. taking down a mob in the US maybe easier but the liklyhood that many of the mob members won&#039;t ar15s aswell maybe far fetched.","time":1491754337,"resto":120273428,"id":"UHBCTshO","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120298982,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)12:12:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120298907\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120298907<\/a><br><br>*have","time":1491754372,"resto":120273428,"id":"UHBCTshO","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"}]}

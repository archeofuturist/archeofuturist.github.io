A woman would be more likely to meet the men at bars and drug them. Several of the victims went to the bar or to a location with a friend, and then we abducted after being kicked out, leaving for a smoke, or being separated. No indication that they would have been drugged at location.<br><br>2) It&#039;s not a young gay man praying on other young gay men. This is just \/pol\/ homophobic hysteria. The profile of these killings and the circumstances of disappearance do NOT indicate a transient, drug user, or young person. There is no indication that gay dating apps are a factor, which in itself suggests an older man.<br><br>3) The possibility that the killer is a taxi\/uber driver cannot be dismissed, but should not be overstated. It could just as easily be an older well-cultivated man with a nice car. Young men trust older gentlemen of means in these types of situations (stuck outside, it&#039;s cold, no jacket. slightly drunk).<br><br>4) The killer is almost certainly white. I keep hearing speculations about race, and they seem prejudicially motivated. Almost every serial killer kills within their race. This is a white killer.<br><br>5) The killer is well-spoken, and likely educated. He could be an M&quot;IT grad, but I personally (gut instinct) suspect he attended NEU. He may work in higher education, but probably not as a professor.<br><br>6) He is educated, but impulsive. This is not some kind of TV Dexter. He is abducting, killing, and dumping, within a few miles of each other. This is not some mastermind. He has urges, and acts on them. He is capable of making mistakes. <br><br>7) He owns or rents a property in the north or west end. He is not killing in his vehicle, though he may be attacking and subduing them there. He is possibly a landlord who owns empty properties. <br><br>8) He has well-kept features. Short hair, kindly eyes. Nice clothes. Grandfatherly appearance.

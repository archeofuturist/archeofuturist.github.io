I&#039;m a history student and I took an extra class in wwII relations. In order to complete that class we each had to do a 20 minute presentation and make a 30 page paper on a subject given to us by the professor. It&#039;s easy you might think. But no. In one of those lectures I mistakenly made a remark about how Nazis also focused on science and did some awesome things. Well this triggered her I guess. She told me to shut up or leave. The next time I went she gave me my subject. It was about how Hitler was viewed in Asia. Every single other student got either something general about Germany, England, Us... Only I was given such a specific subject. There were no books on the matter in my language, no books in english that I could rent. I ended up buying books from fucking China in Chinese and japanese and had them translated in order to complete my paper. And the professor even rejected it the first time I handed it over. She said it wasn&#039;t good enough. Even tho I wrote 47 fucking pages and full of quotations from those books.","time":1491342589,"resto":119517444,"id":"DqBg+jWr","country":"SI","country_name":"Slovenia"},{"no":119521808,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)17:50:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119517444\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119517444<\/a><br>Does this really happen in America?","time":1491342646,"resto":119517444,"id":"QY7MIk9x","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":119521847,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)17:51:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119518383\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119518383<\/a><br>First post best post<br><br>Be like the ancient philosophers. Use this class as an opportunity to argue against your ideals. Like strawmanning, but with intent to win. Make leftist arguments in an attempt to convince even yourself of their correctness, only to refute them privately to yourself later. Then, grade secured, let the teacher know you were duping them, convinced that they would mark you lower for making similarly well written and researched points that disagree with them. That last part is important. Let them know that you felt their class would be hostile to the point of discrimination against differing viewpoints.

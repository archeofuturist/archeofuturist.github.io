Forced trans character, shitty gay romances, etc. It&#039;s already been revealed to be a total shit show from a technical standpoint, but the romances are in the news now too. Specifically, people are complaining that the gay romance isn&#039;t as good as the straight romance. We can use this awareness to our advantage to fuck over MEA. <br>This is the romance in question: https:\/\/youtu.be\/UdXS7xYzzno?t=278<br>This is without a doubt porn, it&#039;s like the &quot;House of Air&quot; garbage a few months back. But we can do something about it. <br><br>If we all go to the ESRB and lodge a complaint about Mass Effect Andromeda to get it reclassified as an AO game, we could cause a tremendous clusterfuck. A similar situation happened with Grand Theft Auto San Andreas - Except in SA it was just files that weren&#039;t even usable. In MEA it&#039;s full on sex. Back in 2007 the first Mass Effect got in trouble with Fox with its sex scenes, and they were far more tame compared to this video. I suggest a two front attack; We contact Fox and tip them off about MEA having porn in it, and lodge complaints with the ESRB about MEA being wrongly classified as a Mature game and should be Adults Only.<br>Here are the relevant links: <br>https:\/\/www.esrb.org\/about\/contact.<wbr>aspx<br><br>You can email or tweet at Fox: <br>foxnewstips@foxnews.com<br>@foxnews","filename":"4534545","ext":".png","w":960,"h":540,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1490073281817,"time":1490073281,"md5":"cBf3EE+zKz9WRBD3DtkwUw==","fsize":477698,"resto":0,"id":"Vzm4P9aI","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"normally-i-would-go-to-v-with-this-but-with-your","country_name":"United States","replies":15,"images":1,"unique_ips":12},{"no":117591679,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)01:21:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"Right now is the optimal time, as today is release day.

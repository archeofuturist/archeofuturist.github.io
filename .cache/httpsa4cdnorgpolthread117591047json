Forced trans character, shitty gay romances, etc. It&#039;s already been revealed to be a total shit show from a technical standpoint, but the romances are in the news now too. Specifically, people are complaining that the gay romance isn&#039;t as good as the straight romance. We can use this awareness to our advantage to fuck over MEA. <br>This is the romance in question: https:\/\/youtu.be\/UdXS7xYzzno?t=278<br>This is without a doubt porn, it&#039;s like the &quot;House of Air&quot; garbage a few months back. But we can do something about it. <br><br>If we all go to the ESRB and lodge a complaint about Mass Effect Andromeda to get it reclassified as an AO game, we could cause a tremendous clusterfuck. A similar situation happened with Grand Theft Auto San Andreas - Except in SA it was just files that weren&#039;t even usable. In MEA it&#039;s full on sex. Back in 2007 the first Mass Effect got in trouble with Fox with its sex scenes, and they were far more tame compared to this video. I suggest a two front attack; We contact Fox and tip them off about MEA having porn in it, and lodge complaints with the ESRB about MEA being wrongly classified as a Mature game and should be Adults Only.<br>Here are the relevant links: <br>https:\/\/www.esrb.org\/about\/contact.<wbr>aspx<br><br>You can email or tweet at Fox: <br>foxnewstips@foxnews.com<br>@foxnews","filename":"4534545","ext":".png","w":960,"h":540,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1490073281817,"time":1490073281,"md5":"cBf3EE+zKz9WRBD3DtkwUw==","fsize":477698,"resto":0,"id":"Vzm4P9aI","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"normally-i-would-go-to-v-with-this-but-with-your","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":117591679,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)01:21:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"Right now is the optimal time, as today is release day. If we did it beforehand, it would give them time to rebrand their labels and boxes. But now their product is being shipped out to stores everywhere, to homes, and is currently being bought. They would have to recall all the purchased copies, revoke predorders, etc. It would be mass chaos and it could potentially put BioWare out to pasture. <br>Keep in mind this is the same company who in Mass Effect 3 had a woman cheating on her husband who was in the military with another woman, and her mistress was encouraging her to leave her husband because she was unhappy with him while he was deployed.","time":1490073705,"resto":117591047,"id":"Vzm4P9aI","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117592182,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)01:27:32","name":"Statue of David","com":"<a href=\"#p117591047\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117591047<\/a><br>Some of us have gotten on this already, last I heard they aren&#039;t letting people be pale skinned males.","time":1490074052,"resto":117591047,"id":"P+B3fUdm","country":"US","trip":"!!wnJYmsvOhxC","country_name":"United States"}]}

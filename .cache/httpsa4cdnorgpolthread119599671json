The party aims to help asylum-seekers and those who have restricted residency rights to obtain a residence permit for work purposes if certain stipulations are met. Immigration and asylum law should remain separate processes, but a &quot;lane change&quot; must be made possible, said G\u00f6ring-Eckardt.<\/span>","filename":"1280px-Flag_of_Germany.svg","ext":".png","w":1280,"h":768,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":150,"tim":1491393966824,"time":1491393966,"md5":"F5gcqo55Y9fbB+lyK02oig==","fsize":5686,"resto":0,"id":"wackPRqf","country":"DE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"germanys-new-immigration-plan","country_name":"Germany","replies":6,"images":0,"unique_ips":7},{"no":119599794,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)08:07:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"No archive<br>No Bump<br>unless the content","time":1491394074,"resto":119599671,"id":"0lNrcBWn","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119600208,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)08:14:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119599671\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119599671<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;During this time, no social services are provided; applicants must earn their living<\/span><br>wow congrats on the next Hitler hope you don&#039;t cave when the UN imposes sanctions.","time":1491394441,"resto":119599671,"id":"mJtecY\/w","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119600537,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)08:18:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Greens<\/span><br><br>discarded","time":1491394704,"resto":119599671,"id":"1kUFmS2T","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":119600731,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)08:20:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119599671\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119599671<\/a><br>meanwhile uneducated mass can flood the europe and get as much money as they can carry even without having a valid passport.

A translated excerpt:<br><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; I also want to refer here very frankly to a very difficult matter. We can now very openly talk about this among ourselves, and yet we will never discuss this publicly. Just as we did not hesitate on 30 June 1934, to perform our duty as ordered and put comrades who had failed up against the wall and execute them, we also never spoke about it, nor will we ever speak about it. Let us thank God that we had within us enough self-evident fortitude never to discuss it among us, and we never talked about it. Every one of us was horrified, yet every one clearly understood that we would do it next time, when the order is given, when it becomes necessary.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; I am now referring to the evacuation of Jews, to the extermination of the Jewish People.

They say the others are all swines, but this particular one is a splendid Jew. But none has observed it, endured it. Most of you here know what it means when 100 corpses lie next to each other, when there are 500 or when there are 1,000. To have endured this and at the same time to have remained a decent person\u2014with exceptions due to human weaknesses\u2014has made us tough, and is a glorious chapter that has not and will not be spoken of. Because we know how difficult it would be for us if we still had Jews as secret saboteurs, agitators and rabble-rousers in every city, what with the bombings, with the burden and with the hardships of the war.

The living quarter samples (negative controls) tested negative, while cyanide residue was found in both the delousing chambers and the gas chambers. The amount of cyanide found had a great variability, possibly due to 50 years of exposure to the elements to varying degrees, but even so, the categorical results were that cyanide was found where expected in both the gas chambers and the delousing facilities, and not found in the living quarters, supporting the hypothesis that the gas chambers were exposed to high levels of cyanide like the delousing facilities, and not low levels for routine fumigation, like the living quarters.<\/span>","time":1492104580,"resto":120927678,"id":"gFX9SUlq","country":"IN","country_name":"India"},{"no":120935235,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)13:30:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120927678\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120927678<\/a><br>The camps in the Western Allies occupied zones were inspected comprehensively.

The chambers were demolished by the Nazis when they abandoned Auschwitz, and the facilities Leuchter examined were, in fact, partially reconstructed.

Therefore, the forced ventilation systems used would be more than adequate to allow the gas chambers to be operated without endangering the executioners. When questioned in court, Leuchter admitted he had not seen a document by the Waffen SS Commandant for construction issued when the gas chambers were constructed, which estimated they had a 24-hour capacity of 4756 people, more than 30 times Leuchter&#039;s estimate of 156.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Leuchter&#039;s opposition to the possibility of gas chambers rests on the relatively low concentration of cyanide residue measured in his sample of the remains of the gas chambers in Auschwitz, compared to his sample of the &quot;delousing chambers&quot; in which clothes were deloused using the same gas, hydrogen cyanide. However, his report contains the assumption that lower concentrations are required for delousing than to kill humans and other warm blooded creatures; in fact, with their simpler structures and slower metabolisms, insects are more resistant to such gross metabolic poisons than mammals. Both toxicological study and practical experience demonstrate that it takes a much higher concentration of cyanide (16,000 parts per million) to kill insects than to kill humans (300 PPM), as well as an exposure time of many hours rather than only minutes. Leuchter also fails to explain his belief that Zyklon-B was used for delousing, in view of his belief that the product would present technical difficulties in ventilating and decontaminating such as to make it impractical for use in a gas chamber.

The legitimate question arises: were they tortured or otherwise coerced by SMERSH to give the testimonies about gas chambers? The answer is obvious to logical people who have read these fragments. Engineers argue that the ovens they installed at Auschwitz were less efficient than civilian ones. Pruefer says that in Auschwitz 1 corpse was cremated in 1 muffle in 1 hour. Obviously, if SMERSH would coerce them, they would testify about the super-ovens, in which 5 corpses could be burned in one muffle in 15 minutes. It follows, then, that they were not coerced. Their testimonies prove that there were gas chambers in Kremas I, II and III. <\/span><br><br>Translation was done by Roberto Muehlenkamp. <br><br>Pruefer, 5 Mar., 1946:","time":1492105041,"resto":120927678,"id":"gFX9SUlq","country":"IN","country_name":"India"},{"no":120936138,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)13:37:25","name":"Anonymous","filename":"1472485207465","ext":".jpg","w":1021,"h":729,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":89,"tim":1492105045677,"time":1492105045,"md5":"XNmfjKLrlmtqqipQDHlUDw==","fsize":207349,"resto":120927678,"id":"4vT+zzo0","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120936189,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)13:37:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120935158\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120935158<\/a><br><a href=\"#p120935316\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120935316<\/a><br><a href=\"#p120935373\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120935373<\/a><br><a href=\"#p120935472\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120935472<\/a><br>Extensive testing has been done on the Auschwitz gas chamber walls.

He is not planning it as a dissemination program for Scientology. The name of it will be the Georgia Guidestones, and he&#039;s planning to turn it over to the State of Georgia when it is completed, so that it can be preserved as a state landmark and never be torn down. Ron just wants to commemorate the first landing site on Earth, that&#039;s all. He is very sentimental and nostalgic when it comes to history, although few people know it.&quot;<\/span><br><br>Steven Fishman, one of the first major whistle blowers from scientology.<br><br>L Ron Hubbard built the Georgia Guidestones.<br><br>But where did LRH and scientology come from? Look into his connections to Alesiter Crowley and Jack Parsons of the OTO (masonic). Furthermore, he was trained by Charles Morgan of the OSS (CIA forerunner).<br><br>So basically it turns out that the Georgia Guidestones was put up by the CIA\/masons.","filename":"GeorgiaGuidestones","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":720,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1493602972337,"time":1493602972,"md5":"zLaIEknmHD4LHJmjrwuieg==","fsize":109997,"resto":0,"id":"R8g2nxEI","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"georgia-guidestones","country_name":"United States","replies":4,"images":1,"unique_ips":4},{"no":123559791,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)21:44:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123559602\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123559602<\/a><br>bump","time":1493603071,"resto":123559602,"id":"WsR5pdPY","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123560058,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)21:47:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"bump","time":1493603226,"resto":123559602,"id":"+Xlb71vs","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":123561663,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)22:01:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123559791\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123559791<\/a><br><a href=\"#p123560058\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123560058<\/a><br>thanks lads<br><br>usually these georgia guidestone threads take off right?<br><br>not when you pull the right threads....then it is slide time","time":1493604102,"resto":123559602,"id":"R8g2nxEI","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123562516,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)22:08:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123559602\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123559602<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;mfw minimal research proves OP is correct<\/span>","filename":"wut","ext":".gif","w":240,"h":180,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1493604535994,"time":1493604535,"md5":"OoB9avbmB06JOInM2mHyTw==","fsize":2991833,"resto":123559602,"id":"EqgDD+U3","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

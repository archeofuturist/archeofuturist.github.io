Excessive fitness causes ventricular hypertrophy in the heart. It is it true that this process, as a byproduct, causes your cardiovascular system to pump very efficiently. But it can also lead to heart failure and heart attacks, if, through not fault of your own, if you were born with a predisposition to coronary artery disease. They&#039;ve scanned mummified bodies in Egypt, some in their 20s, and they&#039;ve seen calcium deposits in the vascular systems etc. And they didn&#039;t have McDonalds and high fructose corn syrup in 2000 BCE. <br><br>So the point is, unfortunately for people, they are doomed to what their genetics predispose in many, if not most, situations, at least in the current year.

All the prevailing knowledge seems to suggest that octogenarians and beyond were fairly &#039;average&#039; people who were not fitness junkies.

And if anything the opposite is true. If you think about it, most women live longer, have high body fat percentages, and they do less physical strain on their bodies, through out their lives, than men. They also have less cardiac events.

I&#039;m arguing there is diminishing returns, in fitness level, so far as longevity is concerned. Add secondarily, that your genetics, and &#039;luck&#039;, play a much larger role in determining your lifespan. <br><br>I think, many people who have atheroscoliosis, should not be exercising to extreme levels because that&#039;s a bad thing waiting to happen. But people don&#039;t know they have the atheroscoliosis because of the lack screening in normal &#039;poor&#039; people.<br><br>I&#039;m not advocating you eat McDonalds and eat 3k calories a day because your grandfather lived to 80 - obviously you&#039;ll develop atherosclerosis in spite of your genetics in that circumstance. <br><br>Athelete&#039;s heart is a controversial issue that we&#039;re not going to solve here today. I&#039;m not a cardiologist. Like you said, there simply isn&#039;t enough data on very fit people in old age because they are a small segment of the total population. My personal belief, is that overstressing a heart, beyond the healthy agreed upon limits, will reduce lifespan. Overworking a mechanical component result in early failure, which would a heart, an organic component, be any different? We&#039;re just organic machines in many ways. The fact of the matter is, your cardiologist might say, &#039;yeah, exercise is good, there is no upper limit&#039;. But they know that almost all people, even the Michael Phelps of the world, will eventually stop exercising at their peak levels, and their hearts will regress to their &#039;normal states&#039;.","time":1493491471,"resto":123347625,"id":"hKAMtk4g","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123366243,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)14:59:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"If you guys are interested in an exaggerrated portrayal of the preventative exams that rich people, probably, and in all likelihood get, there&#039;s a fairly mediocre movie called &#039;Cosmopolis&#039;.<br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=0Wp<wbr>Ec-rJQ3s<br><br>Robert Pattinson is a billionaire who gets heart\/body scans and prostate exams every 6-12 months (I forgot the interval).

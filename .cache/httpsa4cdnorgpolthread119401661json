Written down in times when oppression was severe, the bible stories revolving around the messiah conveniently fit a pattern followed even by greek and roman gods. Poetically edited and reinforced in many large and small ways for 2000 years by those who would seek to control the mind of some simpleton leaf on 4chan, the stories of Jesus Christ are now nearly perfectly crafted to ensnare the weak-minded and those hopeful for magic to exist. <br><br>Just because a story is old doesn&#039;t mean it&#039;s correct.

That&#039;s why it&#039;s easy to fool religious people. hat&#039;s why there are extremists and heaven&#039;s gate cults and Jonestown happened. Stories exist from thousands of years ago in many cultures. Some have lessons to learn that may make something easier in life, but many of them just enforce a desired behavior. Religion doesn&#039;t differentiate.","time":1491273092,"resto":119401661,"id":"qXIlWZ1q","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119418768,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)22:33:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119413666\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119413666<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;the most intelligent ideas<\/span><br>nah, there was a lot of actual knowledge being built in that time about mathematics, engineering, astronomy, physics.

Religion has throughout history, whether you like it or not, been an integral part of the human experience. Whether there is an afterlife, or an all knowing creator is irrelevant. All religious beliefs and denominations are essentially a binding set of metaphors used to describe the inevitability of mortality, the various roads and thresholds we all must pass through in our time, the simultaneous unity and duality of nature, the un-seeable, unknowable force that guides the universe, and the possibility of what lies beyond the veil of human experience.<br><br>I suggest you look into the work of Joseph Campbell, Jung, and Jordan Peterson.","filename":"shcw5jo1_500","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":435,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":108,"tim":1491273602004,"time":1491273602,"md5":"mKIWNxvvPWnQkQ36tbGelA==","fsize":71358,"resto":119401661,"id":"tqC0TA3D","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119419561,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)22:40:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119419337\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119419337<\/a><br>Cool, but then you also say you can&#039;t disprove their retarded beliefs.

Zoroastrianism plays into it as does judaism. Islam doesn&#039;t because it&#039;s only a recently-invented cult. The stories of Jesus&#039; life reflect many stories at once of previous deities, mainly sun gods, but not limited to them. Written down in times when oppression was severe, the bible stories revolving around the messiah conveniently fit a pattern followed even by greek and roman gods. Poetically edited and reinforced in many large and small ways for 2000 years by those who would seek to control the mind of some simpleton leaf on 4chan, the stories of Jesus Christ are now nearly perfectly crafted to ensnare the weak-minded and those hopeful for magic to exist. <br><br>Just because a story is old doesn&#039;t mean it&#039;s correct. In fact, the chances of any accuracy at all are so slim that you may as well worship Harry Potter. <br><br>In short, you&#039;re a victim of a 2,000 year-old conspiracy to control a population that was dissatisfied with the world the way it was and needed eternal torment to threaten everyone to believe.

Do some reading, asshole. Research the history of world beliefs. It&#039;s an eye-opener, even for die-hard believers. Your religion is merely a recycled story designed for subjugation.

Being truly diverse logically means we must encourage and enforce the differences within the human species. Blacks breed and live amongst blacks, whites with whites, Jews with Jews, Asians with Asians, etc. <br><br>Race-mixing and multiculturalism is the logical opposite of &quot;diversity&quot;, since it erases all differences that Nature\/God instilled in us. Celebrate diversity by taking pride in your heritage\/race\/ethnic group; celebrate diversity by keeping your culture and bloodline pure.","filename":"sJWvL","ext":".jpg","w":480,"h":270,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1491686757228,"time":1491686757,"md5":"TdlFPZWlnkpYfr6cT8J2Tg==","fsize":32425,"resto":0,"id":"qivxvS3R","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"diversity","country_name":"United States","replies":6,"images":0,"unique_ips":5},{"no":120186491,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)17:37:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120185032\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120185032<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;arguement from nature<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;argument from god<\/span><br><br>Either you did acid for the first time or are the pope<br><br>I don&#039;t give a fuck about either scenario, and quite frankly neither are true, so you&#039;re just a plain idiot.","time":1491687458,"resto":120185032,"id":"DY8E0+YX","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120187032,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)17:41:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"But why stand in the way of love?

I personally do not believe in such things because of my religion and was wondering if there is an alternative reading for this project. I would be grateful, thanks&quot;<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;My response <\/span><br>I am not sure if I see the connection between your beliefs and your willingness to read the first chapter of Oscar Wilde&#039;s novel. I am not asking you to write a story about ghosts or even believe that they exist. Many Christian writers (such as C.S Lewis) read and wrote about ghosts, dragons, unicorns, and other magical creatures. In college, you will be sometimes asked to write about texts you do not agree with. I have personally written about the work of Karl Marx, but I despise communism, I wrote about Islam, but I am not Muslim. I&#039;m sorry. I cannot provide you with an alternative reading assignment&quot;.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Student threatens my with a formal complaint of religious discrimination (she&#039;s Muslim).<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Next week comes around, she gets caught from the administration on the grounds of plagiarism.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;From what I heard, she ended up being deported.<\/span>","filename":"13876698_1600589176905402_303809726485797228_n","ext":".jpg","w":200,"h":212,"tn_w":200,"tn_h":212,"tim":1492676248076,"time":1492676248,"md5":"VRKe\/wYi+zzYIkzC0M+1IA==","fsize":8388,"resto":0,"id":"8\/ln2zbf","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"educated-in-wat","country_name":"United States","replies":3,"images":2,"unique_ips":3},{"no":121973393,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)04:55:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121971123\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121971123<\/a><br>Was expecting you to get sacked, good job mate","filename":"IMG_20170418_180314_749","ext":".jpg","w":921,"h":881,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":119,"tim":1492678529806,"time":1492678529,"md5":"6nI3QfPnYcLCWc0RPoNPow==","fsize":140415,"resto":121971123,"id":"TZ0fn\/10","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121974223,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)05:07:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121971123\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121971123<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;online literature class instructor<\/span><br><br>so you&#039;re a fucking MA student who is so fucking fat sad and unemployable that you took the blue pill and paid someone 30,000 a year for the privilege of earning $3,000 a semester to administer a class for scamming immigrants, SJWS and gender fluid zhi\/zim\/zers.<br><br>please get off my board.","time":1492679277,"resto":121971123,"id":"cDHw9zj4","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121974798,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)05:15:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121974223\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121974223<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;70K a year actually<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;PhD<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; So what, what&#039;s wrong with profiting off their stupidity?<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;How&#039;s your cuck PM treating your nation recently with their cuck policies<\/span>","filename":"12525543_1048467295195515_3706804069227310525_o","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":720,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1492679752665,"time":1492679752,"md5":"AZuxQhJauRZxZpBlXtrY7A==","fsize":37748,"resto":121971123,"id":"8\/ln2zbf","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"}]}

Notice something? The &quot;V&quot;s are upside down!<br><br>That&#039;s because they represent Lambda, the Greek letter... these warriors are Greek (Spartan, specifically). <br><br>1. The Lambda symbol represents Laconia\/Lacedaemonia, the region of southern Greece ruled by Sparta. <br><br>2. The Greek word for Victory is &quot;Nike.&quot; If the symbol is supposed to spell Victory, it would be an N (Nu). The lowercase form of nu does look like a lowercase &#039;v,&#039; but I&#039;m pretty confident that&#039;s not what he&#039;s talking about.","filename":"300","ext":".jpg","w":1822,"h":960,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":131,"tim":1493323668607,"time":1493323668,"md5":"eM1iM3FaQaG6mOe3bFKGkg==","fsize":193481,"resto":0,"id":"XJ7uXW8K","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"kyle-chapman-stickman-and-his-shield","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":123081693,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)16:20:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123080056\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123080056<\/a><br>He&#039;s a rice farmer.

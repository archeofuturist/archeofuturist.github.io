Cuts the Medicaid programme for low earners<br><br>2. Provides tax credits to help people pay medical bills, but reduced compared to Obamacare<br><br>3. Ends penalties on those who do not buy health coverage<br><br>4. Allows insurers to raise premiums for older people<br><br>5. Blocks federal payments to women&#039;s healthcare provider Planned Parenthood for a year<br><br>6. Insurers would no longer be required to include &quot;essential benefits&quot;, such as maternity care, mental health and emergency treatment<br><br>Personal ranting: Why are so many people wanting the government to give them healthcare instead of using the free market?? God, liberals are retarded and selfish. We have to rip the bandaid off so people will stop leeching off the government and have them start working. Also don&#039;t give me the argument that there are no jobs to fill. There are plenty of jobs that can be taken.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;WARNING TO POSTERS!!

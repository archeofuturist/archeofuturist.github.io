This will make the spent fuel quite radiotoxic, in addition to all the fission products in it. <br><br>It should also be noted that inhalation of a unit of radioactivity of thorium-232 or thorium-228 (which is also present as a decay product of thorium-232) produces a far higher dose, especially to certain organs, than the inhalation of uranium containing the same amount of radioactivity. For instance, the bone surface dose from breathing an amount (mass) of insoluble thorium is about 200 times that of breathing the same mass of uranium.<br><br>Some people believe that liquid fluoride thorium reactors, which would use a high-temperature liquid fuel made of molten salt, would be significantly safer than current-generation reactors. However, such reactors have major flaws. There are serious safety issues associated with the retention of fission products in the fuel, and it is not clear these problems can be effectively resolved. Such reactors also present proliferation and nuclear terrorism risks because they involve the continuous separation, or &quot;reprocessing,&quot; of the fuel to remove fission products and to efficiently produce U-233, which is a nuclear weapon-usable material. <br><br>Moreover, disposal of the used fuel has turned out to be a major challenge.

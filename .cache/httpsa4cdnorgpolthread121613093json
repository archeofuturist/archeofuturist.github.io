His parents, who left from Russia, sent him to Vienna for business school, and was able to bring his 6 siblings to Vienna before WWI broke out.<br> He was conscripted into the Austro-Hungarian military and sent to fight in the Carpathians. He was captured by the Russians and sent to a prison camp. Because he knew Russian from his parents, he was head interpreter for the prison camp, speaking both German and Russian. He even convinces the head of the camp to give the prisoners a barrel of alcohol on Christmas.<br>When news of the revolution comes in, the warden tells everyone in the camp to leave. The warden then orders my great-grandfather and about 600 German\/Austrian prisoners to walk home.<br><br>The man made it back to Vienna in about 2 years.","filename":"Warpepe","ext":".jpg","w":125,"h":108,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":108,"tim":1492477414338,"time":1492477414,"md5":"o3heDCrmpPIwyL\/qRekFCQ==","fsize":2998,"resto":0,"id":"K3R+xWIL","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"family-war-stories","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":121613746,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)21:09:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121613093\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121613093<\/a><br>I don&#039;t have any stories from my grandfathers, but one was a D-Day dodger who fought in Italy and Holland and the other fought in the South Pacific and was captured by the Japanese.

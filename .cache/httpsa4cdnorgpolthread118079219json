FYI, arabic christians also say Allah in Egypt and other Middle-East regions).<br><br>Allah attributes are:<br><br>1. Existence: He exists without a place.Time does not lapse on Allah.<br>2. Oneness: Allah is One without any partners.He is One in His Self, His Attributes, and His Actions.<br>3. Eternity: Allah is Eternal; there is no beginning to His Existence. He has existed since before the creation.<br>4. Everlastingness: Allah is Everlasting; His existence does not come to an end.He does not perish.<br>5. Non-neediness of others: Allah does not need any of His creations and they are all in need of Him.<br>6. Power: Allah has Power over everything.<br>7. Will: Everything that occurs in this world is by the Will of Allah.<br>8. Knowledge: Allah knows about all things before they occur.<br>9. Hearing: Allah hears all what is hearable, without an ear or any other organ.<br>10. Sight: Allah sees all what is seeable, without a pupil or any other organ.<br>11. Life: Allah is alive without a soul, skin, or heart. His Life is not similar to ours. He is alive and does not die.<br>12. Speech: Allah&#039;s Speech (Kalam) is without a tongue or lip. His Speech is not in a language, Arabic or anything else. His Speech does not resemble the speech of the humans.<br>13. Non-resemblance to the creations: Allah does not resemble the creations. <br><br>Pic related: it is absolutely inconceivable in Islam that God looks like a man, or he is sitting somewhere in the sky, or he could have a son or a father.<br><br>We can also discuss about other subjects, I will try to answer any questions. Let&#039;s be courtly.","filename":"Dieu-se-fait-demandeur","ext":".jpg","w":820,"h":480,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":146,"tim":1490361311328,"time":1490361311,"md5":"PkbOB+4r7cd3+MFOswi1AA==","fsize":194815,"resto":0,"id":"QfO79Qxg","country":"FR","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"description-of-god","country_name":"France","replies":24,"images":2,"unique_ips":14},{"no":118079366,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)09:16:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Muslim<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;France<\/span><br><br>checks out","time":1490361414,"resto":118079219,"id":"SHOVMEyp","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":118079515,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)09:18:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118079366\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118079366<\/a><br><br>There are many Muslims in France.

These last 50 years have seen the surge of extremists in the Muslim community. So concerning music I think it is a false problem.

Christians do not believe him to be a man either but a spirit beyond our comprehension. The answer to you is that if you cannot understand high art created and written for grown-ups, you should not discuss them. All the scriptural imagery (harps, crowns, gold, beards, etc) is, of course, merely symbolical attempts to express the inexpressible. Musical instruments are pictured because for many people music is the thing known in the present life which most strongly suggests ecstasy and infinity. Crowns are used and mentioned to suggest the fact that those who are united with God in eternity share His power and splendor and joy. Gold is used and mentioned to suggest the timelessness of heaven (Gold does not rust) and the preciousness of it. God is pictured as a strong, muscularity man with a beard to suggest the perfection of the human body and a beard to suggest wisdom (older people have beards, older people have seen the most, thus they are most wise)<br><br>People like you who take these symbols literally might as well have thought when Christ told us to be like lambs, we should get on all fours and grow wool coats.<br><br>You&#039;re an idiot.

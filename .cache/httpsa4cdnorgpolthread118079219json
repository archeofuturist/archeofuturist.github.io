FYI, arabic christians also say Allah in Egypt and other Middle-East regions).<br><br>Allah attributes are:<br><br>1. Existence: He exists without a place.Time does not lapse on Allah.<br>2. Oneness: Allah is One without any partners.He is One in His Self, His Attributes, and His Actions.<br>3. Eternity: Allah is Eternal; there is no beginning to His Existence. He has existed since before the creation.<br>4. Everlastingness: Allah is Everlasting; His existence does not come to an end.He does not perish.<br>5. Non-neediness of others: Allah does not need any of His creations and they are all in need of Him.<br>6. Power: Allah has Power over everything.<br>7. Will: Everything that occurs in this world is by the Will of Allah.<br>8. Knowledge: Allah knows about all things before they occur.<br>9. Hearing: Allah hears all what is hearable, without an ear or any other organ.<br>10. Sight: Allah sees all what is seeable, without a pupil or any other organ.<br>11. Life: Allah is alive without a soul, skin, or heart. His Life is not similar to ours. He is alive and does not die.<br>12. Speech: Allah&#039;s Speech (Kalam) is without a tongue or lip. His Speech is not in a language, Arabic or anything else. His Speech does not resemble the speech of the humans.<br>13. Non-resemblance to the creations: Allah does not resemble the creations. <br><br>Pic related: it is absolutely inconceivable in Islam that God looks like a man, or he is sitting somewhere in the sky, or he could have a son or a father.<br><br>We can also discuss about other subjects, I will try to answer any questions. Let&#039;s be courtly.","filename":"Dieu-se-fait-demandeur","ext":".jpg","w":820,"h":480,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":146,"tim":1490361311328,"time":1490361311,"md5":"PkbOB+4r7cd3+MFOswi1AA==","fsize":194815,"resto":0,"id":"QfO79Qxg","country":"FR","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"description-of-god","country_name":"France","replies":6,"images":0,"unique_ips":5},{"no":118079366,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)09:16:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Muslim<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;France<\/span><br><br>checks out","time":1490361414,"resto":118079219,"id":"SHOVMEyp","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":118079515,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)09:18:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118079366\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118079366<\/a><br><br>There are many Muslims in France.

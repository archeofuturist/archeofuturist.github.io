Oneness: Allah is One without any partners.He is One in His Self, His Attributes, and His Actions.<br>3. Eternity: Allah is Eternal; there is no beginning to His Existence. He has existed since before the creation.<br>4. Everlastingness: Allah is Everlasting; His existence does not come to an end.He does not perish.<br>5. Non-neediness of others: Allah does not need any of His creations and they are all in need of Him.<br>6. Power: Allah has Power over everything.<br>7. Will: Everything that occurs in this world is by the Will of Allah.<br>8. Knowledge: Allah knows about all things before they occur.<br>9. Hearing: Allah hears all what is hearable, without an ear or any other organ.<br>10. Sight: Allah sees all what is seeable, without a pupil or any other organ.<br>11. Life: Allah is alive without a soul, skin, or heart. His Life is not similar to ours. He is alive and does not die.<br>12. Speech: Allah&#039;s Speech (Kalam) is without a tongue or lip. His Speech is not in a language, Arabic or anything else. His Speech does not resemble the speech of the humans.<br>13. Non-resemblance to the creations: Allah does not resemble the creations. <br><br>Pic related: it is absolutely inconceivable in Islam that God looks like a man, or he is sitting somewhere in the sky, or he could have a son or a father.<br><br>We can also discuss about other subjects, I will try to answer any questions.

The answer to you is that if you cannot understand high art created and written for grown-ups, you should not discuss them. All the scriptural imagery (harps, crowns, gold, beards, etc) is, of course, merely symbolical attempts to express the inexpressible. Musical instruments are pictured because for many people music is the thing known in the present life which most strongly suggests ecstasy and infinity. Crowns are used and mentioned to suggest the fact that those who are united with God in eternity share His power and splendor and joy. Gold is used and mentioned to suggest the timelessness of heaven (Gold does not rust) and the preciousness of it.

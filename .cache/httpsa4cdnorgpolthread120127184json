You can buy a house often time for much cheaper than what rent is. As long as you aren&#039;t a complete fuck head and can do repairs, it is much cheaper to own a house than it is to rent in the long run. You&#039;re always going to have property taxes, but that&#039;s ( depending on the value of the property ) usually only around 100-200 a month, vs several hundreds of dollars per month in rent.","time":1491660011,"resto":120127184,"id":"8c2S2fIp","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120134449,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)10:01:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120134174\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120134174<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I can&#039;t stand the idiots that bitch about banks<\/span><br><br>Stop defending what profits off of debt man.

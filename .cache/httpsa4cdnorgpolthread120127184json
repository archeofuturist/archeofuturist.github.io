You can buy a house often time for much cheaper than what rent is. As long as you aren&#039;t a complete fuck head and can do repairs, it is much cheaper to own a house than it is to rent in the long run.

It took me 2 years of looking before I found one. Now I have it down and am talking to sellers all of the time putting deals together. You will have to offer 10% down because that is a selling point and I just saved for a while and I was trying to get a fourplex or five unit apartment building. I kept going to the bank and they kept delaying me and the houses would sell. Therefore I searched about different ways to acquire property. <br><br>Contract for deed is a private seller mortgage. You break the purchase price down into affordable payments that pays a house off quickly. Watch for people trying to extort you and trust your instinct. The people I am buying off of are 84 and 70 something and live off of social security and their mother passed and the house sat empty for a year. Ready to live in. Carpets clean, fresh paint, updates made. <br><br>Search on Google &quot;biggerpockets contract for deed&quot;. Watch videos, talk to landlords who have bought properties like that. Walk into houses that are for sale within a price range that works for you. Don&#039;t talk to realtors, they are dodos when it comes to real estate. Look up tax records for sellers on houses you like that have been on the market for 90+ days and send a direct letter to them. Cast a net, send out 20 letters to 20 different houses. Offer to pay their taxes and insurance as well as a down payment. Your payment will not be a lot. What the seller will be doing is essentially annuitizing the asset. Most people want quick cash but some people notice that there is no difference between a lump sum and installments as long as they have a need (old ppl living off of social security, retiring landlord, inherited property, life event such as moving or divorce).","filename":"image","ext":".jpg","w":960,"h":720,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1491666828245,"time":1491666828,"md5":"nm8Ke9XTMr4Vy7sirJR7Dg==","fsize":90339,"resto":120127184,"id":"v6PZJcL9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120145976,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)11:53:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120145656\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120145656<\/a><br>lol somebody built a hugemongous new house down the block from me.

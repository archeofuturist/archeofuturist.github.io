But sometimes\u2014by dint of impatience, angst, or pique\u2014you can\u2019t help yourself and you engage the troll directly. It can be a cathartic experience, provided you indulge it sparingly. Indeed, the problem with trolling alt-right goons is that if you getreallygood at it, you\u2019ll probably getaddictedto it, too. So: don\u2019t get too attached to the processes described below, but have them in your arsenal in the event you need to deal with an alt-right troll online.<br><br>One other note about \u201calt-right\u201d trolls, before I get to the \u201cQ&amp;A\u201d portion of this how-to article: if you\u2019re a progressive accustomed to feeling empathy for those who are vulnerable and hurting, you\u2019ll find yourself developing some real sympathy for this particular brand of troll over time. There\u2019s nothing wrong with this, especially as many of the alt-right trolls I discuss in this article are (a) relatively young, (b) sincerely confused about how to make their way in the world (which is why they use awkwardly transparent trolling and pathological online socialization as a crutch), (c) are not hard-right traditionalists so much as lapsed progressives rebelling ineffectually against what they see as the excesses of the \u201cNew Left\u201d, (d) can be quite lovely, authentic, and caring people in person, at least when they\u2019re not engaged in \u201cIRL shit-posting\u201d (see below), and (e) may actually be responding to social and political stimuli which, in the grand scheme of things,aregenuinely bewildering to a young person growing up in the digital age.","filename":"Screenshot_2017-05-03-19-49-17_2","ext":".jpg","w":946,"h":886,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":234,"tim":1493815876210,"time":1493815876,"md5":"tPXSYOCAEKBEgTQXa+Y2+g==","fsize":74060,"resto":0,"id":"Dnm2gsFs","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"normies-currently-learning-about-4chan","country_name":"United States","replies":5,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":123909208,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)08:52:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"My point here is, alt-right trolls do everything within their power to appear to be neo-Nazis online\u2014and there\u2019s a reasonable argument to be made that, when you inhabit a role perpetually, you in practical termsbecomewhat you pretend to be.

Some trolls are \u201ccross-posters,\u201d which means they participate in all three boards. Cross-posters are particularly pathetic online creatures, as it means they spend evenmoretime staring at a screen rather than going outside than their peers do. Note that alt-right trolls will publicly deny any association with, or knowledge of, any of the troll-distribution centers listed above. A common tactic, indeed, is to make some vague reference to \u201cReddit\u201d (e.g., \u201cI saw your article on Reddit and wanted to comment on it\u201d) or, even more specifically, \u201cthe \/pol\/ board on Reddit,\u201d when one is actually from the \u201c\/pol\/\u201d (\u201cPolitically Incorrect\u201d) board on 4chan. This misdirection signals to other trolls who one really is, and\/or allows one to make oneself appear to be a \u201cnormie\u201d (that\u2019s alt-right code for anyone whose social life doesn\u2019t revolve around anonymous web-posting on boards like Reddit, 4chan, or chan).<br><br>The simple fact is thatmostalt-right trolls come from 4chan\u2019s \u201c\/pol\/\u201d board.","time":1493816017,"resto":123909090,"id":"Dnm2gsFs","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123909310,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)08:54:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"Q: What are these distribution centers like? Can I participate in or observe them?

What this means is that you can frequent them as much as you like as either a user or an observer.

So: you\u2019ll see a lot of posts (and some images) that are misogynistic, homophobic, racist, anti-Semitic, and so on. The posters posting this content are in a few cases actuallycommittedmisogynists, homophobes, racists, and anti-Semites; much more commonly, they\u2019re relatively unsophisticated \u201ckids\u201d\u2014using that term here to denote emotional immaturity rather than chronological age\u2014who are exploring complicated anxieties, angers, and associations they don\u2019t really know how to process yet in any way but the anti-social.","time":1493816041,"resto":123909090,"id":"Dnm2gsFs","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123909402,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)08:55:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"Mind you, they don\u2019t seethemselvesthat way.

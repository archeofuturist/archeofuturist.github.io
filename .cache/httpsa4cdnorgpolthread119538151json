I did not come to the same conclusion as you. I&#039;ve had many Islam people telling me that the Qu&#039;ran is a scientific book and that Islam which is based upon this book is a religion of peace. This is mostly lies to justify their religion. I admit some writing in the Qu&#039;ran do correlate with real stuff, but it&#039;s far from science, I&#039;ve spent years studying science before becoming an Engineer, it&#039;s more like some stuff explained by or for someone with an IQ of 75. You will learn more about the Qu&#039;ran if you search and learn about Islam&#039;s history. The true face of Islam only appear in Muslims countries. Islam is not only a religious it dictates the law, it&#039;s an ideology, an evil one. The only reason why Islam did not damage Canada&#039;s culture yet is because they aren&#039;t many muslims yet, but their % is increasing, they already passed a motion against islamophobia and it will become a law if we do not stop it, which is against freedom of speech and will keep us from criticizing Islam.","filename":"1491256990947","ext":".jpg","w":1500,"h":2500,"tn_w":75,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491362337069,"time":1491362337,"md5":"96AN1T1ykBpCJDKRC181yQ==","fsize":1233922,"resto":119538151,"id":"ppC5iHLF","country":"CA","m_img":1,"country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119559604,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)23:19:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119559532\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119559532<\/a><br>Epic kek !

And Al-Fitnah [disbelief or unrest] is worse than killing... but if they desist, then lo! Allah is forgiving and merciful. And fight them until there is no more Fitnah [disbelief and worshipping of others along with Allah] and worship is for Allah alone. But if they cease, let there be no transgression except against Az-Zalimun(the polytheists, and wrong-doers, etc.)&quot; (Translation is from the Noble Quran) The verse prior to this (190) refers to &quot;fighting for the cause of Allah those who fight you&quot; leading some to claim that the entire passage refers to a defensive war in which Muslims are defending their homes and families. The historical context of this passage is not defensive warfare, however, since Muhammad and his Muslims had just relocated to Medina and were not under attack by their Meccan adversaries. In fact, the verses urge offensive warfare, in that Muslims are to drive Meccans out of their own city (which they later did). Verse 190 thus means to fight those who offer resistance to Allah&#039;s rule (ie. Muslim conquest). The use of the word &quot;persecution&quot; by some Muslim translators is disingenuous - the actual Arabic words for persecution (idtihad) - and oppression are not used instead of fitna. Fitna can mean disbelief, or the disorder that results from unbelief or temptation. This is certainly what is meant in this context since the violence is explicitly commissioned &quot;until religion is for Allah&quot; - ie. unbelievers desist in their unbelief. [Editor&#039;s note: these notes have been modified slightly after a critic misinterpreted our language. Verse 193 plainly says that &#039;fighting&#039; is sanctioned even if the fitna &#039;ceases&#039;. This is about religious order, not real persecution.]","time":1491362902,"resto":119538151,"id":"vU\/u7ONd","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119560675,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)23:29:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"Quran (2:216) - &quot;Fighting is prescribed for you, and ye dislike it.

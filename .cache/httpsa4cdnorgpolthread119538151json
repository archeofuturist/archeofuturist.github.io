I even got the Quran I was reading verified by Muslims at my University.<br><br>The Quran, was mostly &quot;Follow Allah, verily he knows what is best (for man), and he is surely most gracious, most merciful&quot;. I feel like that exact line was repeated atleast 1000 times.<br><br>There was good advice in there, and surprisingly, wise views on what an objectively &quot;good&quot; person is.<br><br>HOWEVER, the Quran was not without violence, and controversy.<br><br>In Surah At TauBah, in the first few verses, it says to &quot;After the holy months (on the Islamic calendar), make your duty, to kill O&#039; Mushrikin (the sinners and disbelievers), seek them and kill them, unless they repent (turn to Islam)&quot;.<br><br>Now, the Surah does not specify WHO the disbelievers are, which leads me to believe that it means ALL non Muslims, which begs the question; How do you Muslims justify that? What does it mean?","filename":"image","ext":".png","w":1024,"h":1024,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491350706221,"time":1491350706,"md5":"KW1RjoNq0kvG9B6KSdSUoQ==","fsize":48762,"resto":0,"id":"+YfHpLtZ","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"muslims-of-pol-i-know-you-exist-and-im-calling-to","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":10,"images":2,"unique_ips":8},{"no":119538375,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)20:07:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119538151\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119538151<\/a><br>I guess I&#039;ll add now, that if you read between the lines (not literally), you will see how some modern day science, and the Quran correlate, in teachings.

That linguistic downgrade is symbolic, as the political drama around April 24 ever since has been whether the U.S. president will finally, in his Remembrance Day message, risk incurring the wrath of key NATO ally Turkey by calling the century-old Turkish-perpetrated genocide a &quot;genocide.&quot;<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In a statement just before noon, President Donald Trump carried on the tradition of his predecessors by declining to use the G-word:<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;<\/span><br><br> Today, we remember and honor the memory of those who suffered during the Meds Yeghern, one of the worst mass atrocities of the 20th century. Beginning in 1915, one and a half million Armenians were deported, massacred, or marched to their deaths in the final years of the Ottoman Empire. I join the Armenian community in America and around the world in mourning the loss of innocent lives and the suffering endured by so many.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt; As we reflect on this dark chapter of human history, we also recognize the resilience of the Armenian people. Many built new lives in the United States and made indelible contributions to our country, while cherishing memories of the historic homeland in which their ancestors established one of the great civilizations of antiquity.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt; We must remember atrocities to prevent them from occurring again. We welcome the efforts of Turks and Armenians to acknowledge and reckon with painful history, which is a critical step toward building a foundation for a more just and tolerant future.<\/span><br><br>Admittedly he didn&#039;t promise to do so; probably didn&#039;t even know there was a tradition until a roach put a prepared speech in his hand.","filename":"1460380278296","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":667,"tn_w":187,"tn_h":249,"tim":1493074480641,"time":1493074480,"md5":"tbtiD\/wRef1LVmZ3uKOqbg==","fsize":78025,"resto":0,"id":"3HyiciKo","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"trump-like-obama-and-bush-before-him-refused-to","country_name":"United States","replies":5,"images":1,"unique_ips":4},{"no":122652221,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)18:55:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122652079\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122652079<\/a><br>LOL,stay mad armoshits.","time":1493074553,"resto":122652079,"id":"Ff\/u8Y2g","country":"TR","country_name":"Turkey"},{"no":122652304,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)18:56:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"I couldn&#039;t imagine giving anymore of a fuck about this than ridiculing your stupid ass for giving a fuck about this. <br><br>Go outside.

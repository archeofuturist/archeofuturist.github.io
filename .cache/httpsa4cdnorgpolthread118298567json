The English have never belonged to it and have always known that they did not belong. The assertion contains no element of paradox. The Angevin Empire contradicts it as little as the English claim to the throne of France; neither the possession of Gascony nor the inheritance of Hanover made Edward I or George III anything but English sovereigns. When Henry VIII declared that &#039;this realm of England is an empire (imperium) of itself&#039;, he was making not a new claim but a very old one; but he was making it at a very significant point of time. He meant\u2014as Edward I had meant, when he said the same over two hundred years before\u2014that there is an imperium on the continent, but that England is another imperium outside its orbit and is endowed with the plenitude of its own sovereignty. The moment at which Henry VIII repeated this assertion was that of what is misleadingly called &#039;the reformation&#039;\u2014misleadingly, because it was, and is, essentially a political and not a religious event. The whole subsequent history of Britain and the political character of the British people have taken their colour and trace their unique quality from that moment and that assertion. It was the final decision that no authority, no law, no court outside the realm would be recognised within the realm. When Cardinal Wolsey fell, the last attempt had failed to bring or keep the English nation within the ambit of any external jurisdiction or political power: since then no law has been made for England outside England, and no taxation has been levied in England by or for an authority outside England\u2014or not at least until the proposition that Britain should accede to the Common Market.<\/span><br><br>Not that I&#039;d expect a frog to understand.","filename":"enochcolour","ext":".jpg","w":4158,"h":5134,"tn_w":101,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490490850250,"time":1490490850,"md5":"hVOU0qFWtoV5zifIDjqT9A==","fsize":929133,"resto":118298567,"id":"LmPuDPDE","country":"GB","m_img":1,"country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118301119,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)21:21:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118300342\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118300342<\/a><br><a href=\"#p118300342\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118300342<\/a><br>Nice useless bunch of text <br>Orthodoxy has absolutetly nothing in common with england, it is Byzantine.

I&#039;m asking all the converts here to Orthodoxy to stop fucking LARPing. The only reason you converted is because of &#039;le based Orthobros&#039; meme or because &#039;i love based Russia&#039; or some shit like that. Don&#039;t do this, it paints us in a bad light and it&#039;s extremely irritating to see idiots convert who have no respect for the theological tradition.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;but you&#039;re British! That makes you a LARPer!<\/span><br>No it doesn&#039;t. Why? Because it is the national continuation of Anglicanism. Papism is unEnglish and was forced on us after the Norman Conquest. Orthodoxy, on the other hand, is British - not the LARPy Greek\/Russian kind, but a British kind. Celtic Rite, if you will.","filename":"christianwojak","ext":".png","w":656,"h":699,"tn_w":234,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490489867490,"time":1490489867,"md5":"xJQ2vdT1RkKLVXxg9kP4qQ==","fsize":31525,"resto":0,"id":"LmPuDPDE","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"stop-larping-niggers","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

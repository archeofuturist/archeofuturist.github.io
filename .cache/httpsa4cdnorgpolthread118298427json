But this doesn&#039;t mean it won&#039;t happen. We are literally like three months into his first term and these things take time. This little mishap with Paul Ryan&#039;s shitty bill might be a bit of a set back but it&#039;s not as serious as the media portrays it. They&#039;re just desperate to make every little thing look like a victory for them. I&#039;ve seen shit on kikebook trying to cover the story but it&#039;s all nothing more than ad hominem bullshit. The USA&#039;s political system was made with the intention of preventing anyone from playing it like a fiddle so it&#039;s fine if Trump misses a few notes.","filename":"trumpinovaloffice","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":382,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":191,"tim":1490489786297,"time":1490489786,"md5":"FQMbY36N0Hb3CaYt6wtU+A==","fsize":33765,"resto":0,"id":"JQY6Wgvi","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"trump-still-not-stumped","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

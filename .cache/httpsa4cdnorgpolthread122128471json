Most of my drinking is usually either to relax and get a good sleep, or to get into somewhat positive mood and listen to bunch of uplifting nationalist music and shitpost on \/pol\/. I am not one of those drinkers who drink to go and be violent, noisy or obnoxious in public. <br><br>Before you tell me that it&#039;s unhealthy and it&#039;s killing me - I already know that well enough, and I know that I will cut back on drinking soon even more and start working out. I am just in a period of life right now where I am somewhat lonely, and drinking helps me cope with this and ease the pain. I have not always been like this, I have had very social and happy periods in my life too, and I will soon enter one again. For example, I have plan to go to America one day and study at a conservative private college there that specialises on teaching traditional (In a renaissance-enlightenment way, not modernist\/postmodernist way) western culture and art, then come back and start my own company here in Estonia.","filename":"c2ffbd052bb4e56f1fe27461921bb4aa","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":680,"tn_w":91,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492782018863,"time":1492782018,"md5":"Hyfrgv6iN+j4XxImuuaHcw==","fsize":328032,"resto":122128471,"id":"TLn26Qr7","country":"EE","country_name":"Estonia"},{"no":122136450,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)09:40:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122136329\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122136329<\/a><br>https:\/\/www.workandincome.govt.nz\/","time":1492782034,"resto":122128471,"id":"b\/FGQIs0","country":"NZ","country_name":"New Zealand"},{"no":122136466,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)09:40:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"Your parents actually gave you some sound advice.","time":1492782045,"resto":122128471,"id":"ourufMom","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122136467,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)09:40:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122135987\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122135987<\/a><br>I suppose that is true.

I provided a weapon for him to defeat Hillary and I got a thank you letter hand signed by him.<br>Now there is Illuminati Card Game created in 1994 by Steve Jackson Games was and still is an ominous and eerie predictor of future events. Certainly this game was created by New World Order Illuminati. Judge yourself and remember all these cards printed in 1994.<br>As you can see - all events: 9\/11, Indonesian tsunami, Japanese Nuclear disaster, Attack on Pentagon, BP Oil Spill, Wiki-leaks, Barack Obama - all came true.<br>The last card with Trump face has a text under it that says: &quot;At any time, at any place our snipers can drop you.&quot; It was printed in 1994.<br>However, the true answer why President Trump will be assassinated you will find in even more unlikely source Hustler Magazine printed in May of 1996.<br>It has very interesting article. No not that one. The one called &quot;The flying saucer coup: How a government UFO hoax will end civil rights in America&quot; It&#039;s an unusually long for Hustler but basically it repeats Douglas MacArthur and Ronald Reagan words that world will unite under one New World Order government because of aliens.<br>2 Years ago I told you that Secretary Clinton and her Chairman John Podesta when elected will stage false flag alien visitation to create New World Order.","time":1491512380,"resto":119792344,"id":"h8iQ\/7io","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":119794064,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)17:00:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"Now what? On November 9 night Clinton wounded Podesta with a piece of furniture so he was hospitalized and she was medically sedated after psychosis of loosing the elections. So she could not even come out to her funs to say &quot;thank you for the support&quot;<br>But understand that Clinton and Podesta are just pawns in the hands of their true masters like Rothschilds and Rockefellers. Nothing will stop or divert New World Order plans - not even outsider president Trump.<br>No, they will not kill him before Inauguration like so many fear. It would be unwise for them - to start civil unrest, power vacuum or revolution? Not in their plans. They will let him rule for a few months to show the public that savior Trump is just another Washington bureaucrat. Indeed, what even the best and smartest president can do in just a few months to globally change things - nothing. It would take 3 or 4 years for changes to take full effect. So when no one would terribly miss him - they will drop him as the card says.<br>Then Mike Pence will be explained his duties to move towards the NWO goals according to Illuminati program.<br>But back to the deck of cards. How they possible know? Whoever created them knew that aliens come not from outer space but from the future. Look at gray or green alien - 1 head, 2 arms with 5 fingers each, 2 legs, 2 eyes, 1 nose. My friend and Berkeley professor got his hands on Alien DNA. Guess what? Its over 90% identical to human. Meaning aliens are future humans but without gender or hair. The conclusion is - whoever made those cards had a contact with such future visitors who are guiding humans into to one world government and New World Order.

Kushner has been there from the start, so why now? Why did Trump do his U-Turn now? It&#039;s not Kushner, it&#039;s the recently appointed NSC adviser Army Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster. Kushner has been his &quot;adviser&quot; from the start, even during his presidential campaign when he was pro-Russia and neutral towards Syria, so what changed which caused the U-Turn?<br><br> It&#039;s the appointment of establishment man McMaster; HE is the one who influenced the ousting of Steve Bannon (who is absolutely not a neocon and wants to drain them) and it is McMaster who is veering Trump towards a neoconservative and traitorous foreign policy. Kushner&#039;s just some jewish pretty boy who wants to play peacemaker in the Middle East, he has zero experience and understanding of foreign policy.<br><br> The key is NSC adviser Army Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster. But he&#039;s a whiteman and a military man, and therefore can do no wrong, even if he&#039;s a dyed-in-the-wool establishment neocon figure, according to the genius white nationalist of \/pol\/. Even if he was the one who was responsible for ousting Bannon and even if he is manipulating Trump into aggressing against Syria, you completely ignore that, you retards probably don&#039;t even know who McMaster is, do you?<br><br> Honestly, the fact that you guys view everything through white nationalism means that sometimes your conclusions are not just wrong, but completely illogical and retarded. And then you wonder why nobody takes you seriously except your ideological equivalents. <br><br>Cliffs for morons: It&#039;s not Kushner who is responsible for the recent U-Turns and purging of Bannon, it is MCMASTER. But retarded white nationalists haven&#039;t even heard of him, don&#039;t know who he is and his position within the neoconservative establishment. <br><br>Why are you people so stupid and clueless?

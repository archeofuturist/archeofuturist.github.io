I provided a weapon for him to defeat Hillary and I got a thank you letter hand signed by him.<br>Now there is Illuminati Card Game created in 1994 by Steve Jackson Games was and still is an ominous and eerie predictor of future events. Certainly this game was created by New World Order Illuminati. Judge yourself and remember all these cards printed in 1994.<br>As you can see - all events: 9\/11, Indonesian tsunami, Japanese Nuclear disaster, Attack on Pentagon, BP Oil Spill, Wiki-leaks, Barack Obama - all came true.<br>The last card with Trump face has a text under it that says: &quot;At any time, at any place our snipers can drop you.&quot; It was printed in 1994.<br>However, the true answer why President Trump will be assassinated you will find in even more unlikely source Hustler Magazine printed in May of 1996.<br>It has very interesting article. No not that one. The one called &quot;The flying saucer coup: How a government UFO hoax will end civil rights in America&quot; It&#039;s an unusually long for Hustler but basically it repeats Douglas MacArthur and Ronald Reagan words that world will unite under one New World Order government because of aliens.<br>2 Years ago I told you that Secretary Clinton and her Chairman John Podesta when elected will stage false flag alien visitation to create New World Order.","time":1491512380,"resto":119792344,"id":"h8iQ\/7io","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":119794064,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)17:00:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"Now what? On November 9 night Clinton wounded Podesta with a piece of furniture so he was hospitalized and she was medically sedated after psychosis of loosing the elections. So she could not even come out to her funs to say &quot;thank you for the support&quot;<br>But understand that Clinton and Podesta are just pawns in the hands of their true masters like Rothschilds and Rockefellers. Nothing will stop or divert New World Order plans - not even outsider president Trump.<br>No, they will not kill him before Inauguration like so many fear. It would be unwise for them - to start civil unrest, power vacuum or revolution? Not in their plans. They will let him rule for a few months to show the public that savior Trump is just another Washington bureaucrat. Indeed, what even the best and smartest president can do in just a few months to globally change things - nothing. It would take 3 or 4 years for changes to take full effect. So when no one would terribly miss him - they will drop him as the card says.<br>Then Mike Pence will be explained his duties to move towards the NWO goals according to Illuminati program.<br>But back to the deck of cards. How they possible know? Whoever created them knew that aliens come not from outer space but from the future. Look at gray or green alien - 1 head, 2 arms with 5 fingers each, 2 legs, 2 eyes, 1 nose. My friend and Berkeley professor got his hands on Alien DNA. Guess what? Its over 90% identical to human. Meaning aliens are future humans but without gender or hair. The conclusion is - whoever made those cards had a contact with such future visitors who are guiding humans into to one world government and New World Order. And Trump assassination is really imminent on the date I said.","time":1491512409,"resto":119792344,"id":"h8iQ\/7io","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":119794142,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)17:00:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119794064\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119794064<\/a><br>Bible intimates you&#039;re wrong","time":1491512447,"resto":119792344,"id":"sKCohpOZ","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119794408,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)17:02:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119792344\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119792344<\/a><br>It&#039;s all rhetoric at the moment.

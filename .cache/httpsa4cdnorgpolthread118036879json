Secondly, bad kings do not diminish monarchy as an institution. Thirdly, the collapse of the aristocracy which you described as a &quot;revolution&quot; iirc, was ubiquitous across the west between 1870 and 1910, some argue that WWI was the last gasp of a useless aristocracy which no longer wielded real power. The going down of the landed ruling elite and the rise of the masses is what Evola described as the age of Iron which was the lowest age of history. <br><br>The &quot;degeneracy&quot; you believe is caused by WWII is actually caused by proletarianism. Marx was right in one crucial respect, he predicted that we would all become proletarians and sell our labour. We live in an age of mass politics, mass culture, mass war, and mass consumption. WW1 was the first mass war, and the revolutionary movements on the left and the right in the 20th century were the mass politics. Mass culture as a force rose out of the mass political propaganda post-ww2, and since 1968 we have lived in a world of mass culture. This all stems from WW1 which was inevitable I believe, further still the roots of this decline can be traced to the French Revolution.","time":1490330019,"resto":118036879,"id":"4d8iI0jM","country":"GB","trip":"!!RTdZyZlKJyM","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118040938,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)00:33:59","name":"Lazarus","com":"<a href=\"#p118040645\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118040645<\/a><br>I&#039;m only a literally who because i decided to post with one.<br><br>Do i need to show my browsing history or something?<br><br>I&#039;ve been posting before \/new\/ was killed by luggage lad.","time":1490330039,"resto":118036879,"id":"vEq01kSG","country":"GB","trip":"!!0EAUE+buNkM","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118040940,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)00:34:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"Who else \/on14thbeer\/?<br><br>Any film recommendations?<br><br>I&#039;m watching Outlaw at the moment.

Indeed, this is the case and he great debates between Malthus and Ricardo in the 19th century were the microcosm. The Manchester Capitalists, the free-trade liberals that formed the Anti-Corn Law League were middle class industrialists, bourgeois! The transition of power from the aristocracy to the bourgeois began in 1688 and continued through industrialism. <br><br>The problem is that you also seem to assert that monarchism was somehow operating hand in hand with industrialism. This is false. The French were the most absolutist and their economics was Physiocratic. Even when Quesnay and Turgot were products of the enlightenment, they still argued that wealth resided in the land. Industrialism was something not considered in France in the 18th century. Germany did indeed industrialize, but compare that to the English experience. The English industrialized first because power had already passed into the hands of the bourgeois in 1688. The institutions of capitalism were already set. <br><br>Industrial capitalism destroys aristocracies and raises up the bourgeois, see the pic, in England, the liberalization of trade with the united states collapsed wheat prices, and so bankrupted the English aristocracy, who had to marry into upper-bourgeois Yank and Jewish families. <br><br>This class is now in the decline, we are moving down further past the stiff upper lip of the English bourgeois into mass plebeianism. It is not the Jews manipulating everything. It is not surplus wealth, for without it there would be no art or civilization. <br><br>It is a very bad argument to fall back on &quot;the Jews&quot;. Although you seem to argue for a non-Marxian socialism, which is a valid case, socialism is still anti-tradition. It is the ideology of the masses, and so it is a further step down in mass plebeanism. Universal democracy, mass culture, and the death of Christianity are to blame. Not the Jews.","filename":"globalisation 1870 to 1910","ext":".jpg","w":1594,"h":512,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":40,"tim":1490331593772,"time":1490331593,"md5":"uanACvlgHKKi\/KcFXhwvNA==","fsize":93449,"resto":118036879,"id":"4d8iI0jM","country":"GB","m_img":1,"trip":"!!RTdZyZlKJyM","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118043669,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)00:59:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118043512\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118043512<\/a><br><br>I&#039;m probably older than you, I just never stopped being a sperg","time":1490331595,"resto":118036879,"id":"3YggXCVB","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"}]}

In Ottoman-occupied Greece tax resistance became a form of patriotism,[9][10] and sometimes a condition for survival. Property and commercial tax systems were left in shambles.[11] Greece became independent in 1822, but the corruption in modern Greece and the resistance to pay taxes to Ottoman Empire Era is connected by the fact that part of the ethnic Greek officials of the Ottoman Empire kept their positions after Greek independence and established the way the Greek state was run. Immediately after independence, Greeks were subjected to a heavy tax burden caused by the debt accumulated during the independence war, which was combined with the poverty and devastation caused by the war. Tax evasion was, however, a larger problem among the high-ranking officials, which were accustomed to being unchecked by the Ottomans and sought to preserve that status in the Greek

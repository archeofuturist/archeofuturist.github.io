The tories say its because they have no control over EU migration. Have they done anything at all to reduce non-Eu migration? No.<br><br>The tories&#039; only selling point is that they aren&#039;t as insane as labour, but now labour are finally dying with a 0% chance of winning you cucks will still vote tory. They love you for it. They are zionist-cock-sucking, immigrant loving, globalists but the people who are against every one of their ideals vote for them anyway.<br><br>How do people still trust them? On immigration? On anything? Go and search for past tory campaigns, specifically for promises on immigration, since 1948 (when labour started inviting foreigners en masse), for these past 69 years the tories have been in power for 42. They have never done anything to reduce or outright end immigration, despite empty promise after empty promise.","time":1492637809,"resto":121892841,"country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121900608,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)17:37:17","name":"The Resident Nigger","com":"<a href=\"#p121900179\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121900179<\/a><br>Oh yeah.

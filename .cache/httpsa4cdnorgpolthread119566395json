I thanked her and told her that it was mine and she said &quot;The things found on earth are kept by the collector&quot; and walks away... I looked at the cashier who is as amazed as me and, in a loud voice, I say to the lady, &quot;is this some kind of joke?! Give me back my $20!&quot; I followed her into the parking lot of the Piggly Wiggly, still shouting, but she would not stop.... When she got to her car, she put her shopping bags from the Piggly Wiggly on the ground to open her car door of her Sudan. So I ran up, grabbed the bags and ran off yelling &quot;The things found on earth are kept by the collector!!&quot; I went home nervous, shaken and agitated because I&#039;ve never stolen anything in my life.<br><br>So here&#039;s the question \/pol\/ if someone steals cash from you is it legal to steal something from them soyou&#039;re even... is it moral?","filename":"piggly wiggly","ext":".jpg","w":4390,"h":2958,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":168,"tim":1491366353574,"time":1491366353,"md5":"VGl6H439eAVWNUrTjtOlzQ==","fsize":1082826,"resto":0,"id":"DJRTYkTQ","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"what-is-wrong-with-people","country_name":"United States","replies":7,"images":1,"unique_ips":8},{"no":119566523,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)00:27:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"Nice copy-pasta bro","time":1491366438,"resto":119566395,"id":"xe5kCOyW","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119566620,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)00:28:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"seems like you do this everyday, OP.

That didn&#039;t sit well with me because from my perspective they were acting rationally in the dual pursuit of personal status and an overarching goal. As time went on, I came toward the belief that many of the very smartest people in recorded history struggled with how to explain what makes sense to people of this nature to the average person, and that this is what makes old stuff like myths, legends, and art so effective in shaping peoples&#039; minds.<br><br>That&#039;s also, as a matter of fact, the very system turned against our children in the form of the modern education system.

(And then you can go on to note that her father and grandfather belong to the satantic death cult known as the Order of the Skull and Bones, look up her collaberation with Antony Sutton&#039;s work, and who else belonged to this cult -- why do so many people belong to occult magic societies?

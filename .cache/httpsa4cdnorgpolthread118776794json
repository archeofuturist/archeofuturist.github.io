In state cuts it down to 100k a year for the best state college (admittedly which can vary state to state, but there are ways around that too.) You can that down to 80k a year or so if you don&#039;t live in campus housing (but you still will have to find some sort of housing or live with parents and commute). Ok so now 80k with no assistance or scholarships. Basic scholarships for getting certain act\/sat scores and gpa are pretty much automatic. So if you know you or your parents can&#039;t afford tuition ahead of time aim for those numbers in highschool. Auto net you 2-3 grand a year So lets say middle of the road and say 10k deductions. Thats 70k In my situation I covered 50k with subsidized loans grants and scholarships. So as a new graduate I owe 20k in subsidized loans that only now start accruing interest. Thankfully my dad paid the difference in 20k so I did not hvae to get unsub&#039;d loans. That&#039;s just one way to do it. Another route you can go for is to go to a lesser ranked state college (in or out). University of Alabama for example would have given me a nearly full ride with my qualifications coming our of high school. Or if you are unsure of what degree you want go to commnity college - where if you have a low gpa you can get an outstanding college one and transfer your last two years and get great scholarships still get a well respected degree (and pay less overall). So this is assuming you are a pretty good student overall, or even a bad student there are paths to low cost high quality degrees; <br><br>I am not saying its easy, or there aren&#039;t trade-offs. Living with parents for example might make getting to classes harder or you might miss out on college expeirience. Transferring schools might be an abrupt change etc.But its not difficult. Not at all. It just requires dedication and a commitment to work, heck ROTC will pay too.","time":1490794386,"resto":118776794,"id":"FZ2DtYOe","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118786218,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)09:34:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118785666\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118785666<\/a><br><br>Fuck off commie prick.","time":1490794468,"resto":118776794,"id":"Qg9NmqcC","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118786234,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)09:34:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118776794\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118776794<\/a><br>I&#039;m 25 and drive a 2016 Lincoln mkz, but live in a condo.

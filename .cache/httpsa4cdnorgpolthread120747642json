I\u2019m not sure where it was originally published, but probably in the Nazi Party\u2019s daily newspaper the V\u00f6lkischer Beobachter. The article is dated 27 January 1934.<br><br>The source: Joseph Goebbels, \u201cMehr Moral, aber weniger Moralin!\u201d Wetterleuchten (Munich: Zentralverlag der NSDAP, 1939), pp. 382-385.","filename":"joseph_paul_goebbels","ext":".jpg","w":369,"h":441,"tn_w":209,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491998555922,"time":1491998555,"md5":"qoYNVh+iR7ZZHayPn5MGYw==","fsize":49180,"resto":0,"id":"Zb74b5Mq","country":"AU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"more-morality-less-moralism","country_name":"Australia","replies":21,"images":10,"unique_ips":8},{"no":120747723,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)08:03:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"Every revolution has its mistakes, ours too. That is not in itself bad, since they mostly disappear on their own or with time. The important thing is that those in charge keep their eyes open, and do not remain silent when they ought to speak out of fear of the public. Obviously, an historic revolution of vast extent brings a mass of nonsense to light along with its enormous benefits.<br><br>It becomes dangerous only when the nonsense is left to grow, thus hemming in and strangling the healthy, organic development of the revolution.<br><br>It is time today to expose some of this nonsense that has accompanied the National Socialist revolution to the full light of day, to examine it without pity.<br><br>That is even more necessary, since otherwise some of this nonsense over time may gradually corrupt the style and nature of our revolution, leaving to posterity an image of our nature and goals that in no way corresponds to National Socialist convictions and views.<br><br>Certainly there is need for public regulation of the great moral foundations of our national life. However, some nonsense is also spreading that attempts to reach beyond that to establish a code for the purely personal conduct of individuals.<br><br>That leads eventually to a moralism that is everything other than National Socialist.<br><br>Peculiar people whose life is either behind them, or have no right to have one ahead of them, preach moralism in the name of our revolution. This moralism often has nothing in common with true morality. They proclaim ethical laws that might be appropriate for a nunnery, but are entirely out of place in a modern cultural state.","filename":"256full-joseph-goebbels","ext":".jpg","w":256,"h":370,"tn_w":86,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491998613265,"time":1491998613,"md5":"slTHdwOdSvyHocsKkm0BBg==","fsize":19792,"resto":120747642,"id":"Zb74b5Mq","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":120747802,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)08:04:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"An example. In a major central German city an advertising poster for a soap company showed a fresh, attractive girl holding the soap package in her hands. A moral knight who unfortunately had the right to determine the fate of this poster forbade its distribution on the ground that it offended the moral sensibilities of the population, since the woman in the poster was holding the soap in a place \u201cthat for moral reasons cannot be described more precisely.\u201d<br><br>What is moral about this? The person announcing the ban, who presumes that other people share his dirty fantasies, or the German people and the National Socialist movement, that are rightly upset and in opposition to such a ridiculous action?<br><br>Investigating the matter, we find that this wonderful citizen discovered his attraction for National Socialism three months after we took power, which however did not stop him from issuing the ban in the name of National Socialism.<br><br>Things have gone so far that this company of moralists does not stop at the borders of private life. They would love to establish purity committees in cities and the countryside that would keep on eye on M\u00fcller\u2019s and Schulze\u2019s love and marriage life. It is true that they do not want to go so far as to ban kissing altogehter, as in the familiar operetta, since it is too popular a pastime. If it were up to them, however, they would turn National Socialist Germany into a wasteland of muttering and complaining, a place where denunciation, spying, and extortion were the order of the day.<br><br>These same moralists often turn to government offices with the request to ban films, plays, operas, and operettas, since the dancers, stars, etc., apparently represent a grave danger to public decency. If we gave in to their demands, we should soon see only old ladies and men on the screen or the stage. The theaters would be empty, since the public generally does not attend them to see the same people they see in church or old people\u2019s homes.","filename":"untitled","ext":".png","w":620,"h":465,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":93,"tim":1491998673893,"time":1491998673,"md5":"uogY29VBiAjlzhIa+WePOw==","fsize":255675,"resto":120747642,"id":"Zb74b5Mq","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":120747871,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)08:05:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"Save us from these hypocritical creatures who have no genuine strong conception of life, and who in reality preach no honest morality.

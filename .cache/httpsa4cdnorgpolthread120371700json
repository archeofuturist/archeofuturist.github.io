Tomahawks are obsolete and these had already been paid for, so if they weren&#039;t used here they&#039;d probably end up mothballed, costing the state almost the same without a return on the investment. 22 jet fighters is a very significant number for a country like Syria and this will have weakened Assad&#039;s personal power considerably, unless Russia picks up the tab, which is also good for the US. Add to this minimal casualties and simultaneously strongarming China, and you&#039;ve made good return on a cost that was already paid years ago when the missiles were actually produced.","time":1491789111,"resto":120371700,"id":"3UV24Ful","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":120373504,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)21:52:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120371700\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120371700<\/a><br>Who gives a fuck?

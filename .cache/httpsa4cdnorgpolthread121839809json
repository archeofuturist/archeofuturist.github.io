Also what you&#039;re saying falls in line with a more general trend of &quot;mathematicizing&quot; things and turning something like the economy into a maintained technocracy anyway, which overall is a very good thing and should happen and is inevitable anyway. Machines will slowly leak into easily computable fields like econometrics and slowly take over things like law which are still computable but not as obviously or easily, giving humans a longer window of opportunity at it before AI algorithms and machines displace them from that too.","time":1492606778,"resto":121839809,"id":"O61jiclJ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121841215,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)09:01:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121839809\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121839809<\/a><br>It would be racist","time":1492606871,"resto":121839809,"id":"ObJhA9T0","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

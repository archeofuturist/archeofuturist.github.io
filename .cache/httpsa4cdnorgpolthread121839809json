Also what you&#039;re saying falls in line with a more general trend of &quot;mathematicizing&quot; things and turning something like the economy into a maintained technocracy anyway, which overall is a very good thing and should happen and is inevitable anyway. Machines will slowly leak into easily computable fields like econometrics and slowly take over things like law which are still computable but not as obviously or easily, giving humans a longer window of opportunity at it before AI algorithms and machines displace them from that too.","time":1492606778,"resto":121839809,"id":"O61jiclJ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121841215,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)09:01:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121839809\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121839809<\/a><br>It would be racist","time":1492606871,"resto":121839809,"id":"ObJhA9T0","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121842665,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)09:16:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121839809\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121839809<\/a><br>Human life isn&#039;t a business<br><br>Human desires and motivations need individual careful tending to individually,<br>Man must work not for works sake but for his own peace of mind, <br><br>Also by the time AI comes about replicator technology will be on the cusp of making taxes only useful relevance be symbolic I&#039;d suggest .3-.03 sales tax<br><br>Human life also isn&#039;t a game scenario, we are flawed in ways you can&#039;t shouldn&#039;t use logic for","filename":"420 blaze it","ext":".jpg","w":800,"h":800,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492607762405,"time":1492607762,"md5":"C4Cmv99tLLR1n4vJxck9Ag==","fsize":109563,"resto":121839809,"id":"S1i0YDfs","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121843202,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)09:21:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121841215\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121841215<\/a><br>Kek","time":1492608117,"resto":121839809,"id":"tfriICNN","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":121844483,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)09:35:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121840200\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121840200<\/a><br>I didn&#039;t quite get the image, but you&#039;re right<br><br><a href=\"#p121842665\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121842665<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Human life isn&#039;t a business<\/span><br>I didn&#039;t mean i want to be fully controlled by machines nor humans, but a mix of both.<br><br><a href=\"#p121841074\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121841074<\/a><br>It&#039;s inevitable, yes, but we can still do something to avoid being completely replaced.","time":1492608946,"resto":121839809,"id":"awdSgxFv","country":"IT","country_name":"Italy"},{"no":121844830,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)09:39:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"Plot twist: humans don&#039;t care about optimization on either level.

(((They))) vilified McCarthy&#039;s name to such an extent, his name is now associated with, ironically, un-American activities. These days it seems that the new McCarthyists are the Dems, CIA, FBI, and their supporters, but the funny thing is, While McCarthy was a true patriot, these modern McCarthyists, are anything but patriots.

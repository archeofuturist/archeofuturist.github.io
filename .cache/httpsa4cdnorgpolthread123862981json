In North America that is even more taboo. What I don&#039;t understand is why the left cannot be subverted to provide a political candidate who will dramatically reduce immigration (in NA or Europe) without conservative social policies that typically turn off women and younger voters. <br><br>Offer to legalize weed, give gays marriage, keep abortion etc. but reduce immigration. Has this been tried in any major way yet? You may love the moral purity of fascism and extreme social reactionary policies but they have failed to yield a single successful candidate in a major wealthy Western nation.<br><br>You can be disgusted personally with gays but realize (as I guess Milo likely does) that a White gay male running as a conservative has the best chance of winning any sort of nationalistic reforms in a democratic manner at this point. They tried having Cubans run as Republicans, and it did not work at all. I think gay nationalists vs. straight Silicon Valley technocrats are likely the future of American politics. <br><br>Pic Unrelated","filename":"chloe","ext":".jpg","w":1535,"h":2048,"tn_w":187,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493781074908,"time":1493781074,"md5":"Z2JBThOneSF3NpW5Qm26NA==","fsize":429184,"resto":0,"id":"+9WqyjHt","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"why-are-social-leftism-and-antiimmigration","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":123865844,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)23:37:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123862981\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123862981<\/a><br>bump","time":1493782633,"resto":123862981,"id":"8T3vJwi2","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

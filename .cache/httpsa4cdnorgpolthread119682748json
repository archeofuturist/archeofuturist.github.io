Merkley (D-OR) was the first senator to declare he would use every tool in his power to stop this power grab\u2014including a filibuster. <br><br>He kept his word. His filibuster demonstrated what leadership looks like and set the bar for Democratic resistance in the Senate. <br><br>We need to show him\u2014and all Democrats\u2014that when they take principled positions and back them up with action, we will be in solidarity with them. <br><br>Thank Sen. Merkley for leading by example and doing everything he can to block Trump&#039;s extremist Supreme Court nominee.","filename":"open-uri20170405-3207-1npua4d","ext":".jpg","w":915,"h":610,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1491440252018,"time":1491440252,"md5":"WNyQXWsb3V3C8nT02xBLCg==","fsize":130809,"resto":0,"id":"9sRw8gFa","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"on-tuesday-april-4-senator-jeff-merkley-dor-took","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":119683206,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)21:01:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119682748\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119682748<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;They did it to us<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Reeee lets do it back to them<\/span>","time":1491440467,"resto":119682748,"id":"ekwokFDY","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119683334,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)21:02:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"get fucked drumpfshits :)","time":1491440528,"resto":119682748,"id":"5xxNL5+T","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

Also they are getting closer every day to having a nuclear capable ICBM, every previous president has literally kicked the can down the road thinking that worst case scenario, China won&#039;t let NK hit the red button. But the new Kim Jong Un has been less responsive to China in their bilateral talks than his forefathers, so China is legit concerned that they won&#039;t have the same influence they used to, if DPRK does get the ability to strike US homeland. <br><br>Furthermore, Trump puts up like a &#039;tough guy&#039; and would be ridiculed in domestic politics if he allowed &#039;little Kimmie&#039; to taunt us, so that&#039;s a factor. And Kim is the same way, from his perspective he may be terrified that his country will finish the nuke, and then finally has to follow through in the threats his father and grandfather have been making. <br><br>Specifically the US military intelligence is suggesting they will have a nuclear bomb capable of hitting US soil before 2020,so now or never, It&#039;s Trump&#039;s problem to deal with.","time":1493393945,"resto":123206135,"id":"lCK6sJVW","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123206970,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)11:39:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123206857\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123206857<\/a><br>I think both have made the situation worse desu<br><br>if NK feels more threatened by Trump then it&#039;s only natural for them to ramp up their deterrent","time":1493393961,"resto":123206135,"id":"8k3k87AK","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"}]}

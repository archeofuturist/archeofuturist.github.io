Le Pen stupidly went the way of full nationalist believing it was the France back in 1800s. It&#039;s not unfortunately. Societies change, people change. Globalist propaganda won over France. <br><br>France is in cultural suicide just like Belgium Sweden and Germany. A lot of French people have dual nationalities. Le Pens stance on EU puts that in jeopardy in their eyes. Continental European&#039;s see themselves &quot;as one&quot; people. If one country goes down they all want to go down, &quot;it&#039;s only right&quot;. They see themselves as one, Britain was never apart of this that&#039;s why it was so easy for them to leave. <br><br>&quot;All for one and one for all&quot; is the European motto. <br><br>The French are willing to sacrifice the safety and the future of their society for short lived comfort. That&#039;s the sad and bitter truth.<br><br>The endless wars have cucked their and most of European society into submission to Islam. They have been sold out. <br><br>By 2039 France will be compromised of Muslims. Non moderate but conservative. <br><br>How do I know this? I work for a major news organisation and have served with GIGN guys. <br><br>We need to focus on winning small battles instead of taking on huge scale wars. Brexit and Trump were fluke victories and we cannot rely on them much longer.","filename":"297_001","ext":".jpg","w":783,"h":730,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":233,"tim":1490783996875,"time":1490783996,"md5":"sT23HDlCV1F1eQ94hV6RjA==","fsize":169655,"resto":0,"id":"1oTu3cB+","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"le-pen-wont-win-sorry-pol","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

You explore the woods, make games, laugh together. You never leave the lands you&#039;re born on but that&#039;s okay because all of your friends and family are assured to stay here as well.<br><br>You marry your wife at age 13. You&#039;ve both known each other since you were children. You&#039;ve done nothing special to get her, no game, no pick-up artistry no gymceling (you already have a healthy form due to playing outside all day). You guys got together purely because you&#039;ve known eachother since birth and feel close and comfortable with eachother. You consummate your marriage to her, looking into innocent teen eyes as you orgasm, coming into her virgin pussy unprotected. She&#039;s pregnant with your son and you start working on the farm, or by fishing, or hunting or whatever your trade was in order to start providing for your family. You do this over the next several years, and by the age of 30 you have 10 kids with her all working in the same village. Work is hard but it keeps your body in good shape. There is no commute, no cubicles, no busy work. Your just do your labor and come home at night and have sex with your wife all night.<br><br>You die around age 55-60, much earlier than the modern year. But when you die you&#039;re not absolutely literally falling apart, hooked up with a bunch of machines, being pumped with tons of meds, shitting into a bag. You pass away peacefully but do so with the knowledge that all of your children will marry white people from the surrounding area as well, and that you&#039;ve lived a fulfilling and happy life.","filename":"1491838133332","ext":".jpg","w":1536,"h":2048,"tn_w":187,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492472138366,"time":1492472138,"md5":"rIW8a9szPPhhkSkWEBKUJw==","fsize":1450078,"resto":0,"id":"mrejdk+d","country":"AR","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"was-western-civilization-a-mistake","country_name":"Argentina","replies":257,"images":47,"unique_ips":124,"tail_size":50},{"no":121602428,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)19:36:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"Nowadays you don&#039;t have any of that. Civilization, Social media, college has ruined that. When you consummate your marriage with your wife she&#039;ll be like 25-30 and her body will already be used up by other men. You&#039;ll probably have 1-2 kids because of her declining fertility. She&#039;ll feel a lot less close to you because you&#039;ve likely only known each other post-adolescence. You might have had to truly suffer to get her too, learning &quot;game&quot; and &quot;pick-up-artistry&quot; and sacrificing all of your free time in the gym. This is because instead of just competing with the 10 other dudes in your village, you&#039;re competing with thousands of men in the cities and universities and on Tinder and Facebook.

Which it absolutely isn&#039;t. It might very well be for the intended effect of making situations regarding migration or the EU worse than they are ; he knows the ins and outs of communication and &quot;propaganda&quot; so it wouldn&#039;t be surprizing if he decided to consider some of his videos as small-scale whistle-blowing. But it does result is throwing some info that simply isn&#039;t true (like one point at which he claimed that military patrols were a common occurence in France and that fucking tanks are on parisian streets. Which I would probably be aware of since I live there)<br>Still with Europe, he is aware that the overall political paradigm here is more left-leaning than that of the USA but once again you cannot throw this onto the entire continent and call Merkel&#039;s liberal economic policies &quot;socialism&quot; (or say that &quot;some of her policies are not things Stalin would have refused&quot; which is a complete non-argument. The USA has anti-tobacco campains and paid vatations which Hitler would not have refused if you want to play the dictator-namecalling game). The political balance changes a lot from country to country and even within eastern-Europe which he seems to completely disregard and looks at as if most of it was ruled by local Orbans. OVerall he tends to judge local elements too quickly due to lack of knowledge about them which I really can&#039;t blame him too much for since the info on some of them is not always easy to get in english, or not always reliable. His view on the FN could be an example.","time":1492010835,"resto":120762753,"id":"Omcb82Nm","country":"FR","country_name":"France"}]}

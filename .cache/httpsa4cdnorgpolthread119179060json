Street demonstrations take place in Tunisia leading to the ousting of longtime president Zine El Abidine Ben Ali in January 2011. The demonstrations were precipitated by high unemployment, food inflation, corruption, a lack of political freedoms like freedom of speech and poor living conditions. Resulted in scores of deaths and injuries, most of which were the result of action by police and security forces against demonstrators. Labour unions were said to be an integral part of the protests.

Allegations of high unemployment, food inflation, corruption, a lack of political freedoms like freedom of speech and poor living conditions, protestors take to the streets against their governments, government authorities attempt to supress the protest, violence escalates. These protests result in one of several options either the regime was toppled or major uprisings and social violence occurred, including civil wars or insurgencies.<br><br>But those are only the protests which resulted in high levels of violence. There are also sustained street demonstrations taking place in Morocco, Bahrain, Algeria, Iran, Lebanon, Jordan, Kuwait, Oman and Sudan.

None of these protests were spontaneous. Each were the results of 5 years of careful planning by the US State Department, The CIA, George Soros and the pro-Israel lobby. Each of these groups worked together to flood the people with propaganda. Through out the Arab world and West alike we were told that these were protests to bring democracy to the people and to overthrow dictators. None of these protests made any reference anti-US sentiment over involvement in Palestine or Iraq. All of these protests were instigated by middle class students.<br><br>The claimed US goal of the Arab Spring revolutions was to replace unpopular despotic dictators while maintaining the autocratic US-friendly infrastructure that had brought them into power to bring on democratic governments led by the educated middle class youth in these countries. At the time the US government made no attempt to keep secret that they were willing to pay mercenaries, and to arm and fund militias in order to achieve this goal.<br><br>Evidence of this is reflected in the Wikileaks cables and websites of CIA pass through foundations. The US State department was running conferences and workshops with the people who would later become the leaders of the Arab Spring. In 2008 Obama initiated an Internet campaign team to train Arab Spring cyberactivists in encryption technologies and social media skills so they could organise using google, facebook and twitter. These activites were promoted through key &#039;democracy&#039; promoting foundations.","filename":"5","ext":".jpg","w":1920,"h":1280,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1491120630076,"time":1491120630,"md5":"hxBERqCYK6tBFfL\/We1v7g==","fsize":335973,"resto":119179060,"id":"u0KFRgWh","country":"CA","m_img":1,"country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119179208,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)04:10:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"whats everyone up to tonight?

Born Gy\u00f6rgy Schwartz 12 August 1930 Soros grew up in Nazi occupied Hungary. His name was changed to George Soros in 1936 as a protective camouflage against antisemitism. At age 13 Soros began his career by reporting other Jewish children to a government official which earned him trust, he aquired official doccuments naming him as a christian in return by means of being named as the official&#039;s god son. He then went on to work with his adopted godfather to confiscate property from the local Jewish population. Soros describes that time as &quot;the happiest time of my life&quot; and when asked if he felt guilt over the events he stated &quot;No, only feelings of absolute power.&quot; In 1947 Soros moved to London and enrolled in the London School of Economics where he studied under Karl Popper, the Austrian-British philosopher who was one of the first proponents of an \u201cOpen Society.\u201d Soros then worked at several merchant banks in London before moving to New York in 1963. In 1970, he founded Soros Fund Management and in 1973 created the Quantum Fund in partnership with investor Jim Rogers. The fund made annual returns of over 30%, cementing Soros\u2019s reputation and putting him in a position of power\u2014one he utilizes to this day to advance the agenda of his mentors.<br><br>In the 1990s, Soros began a string of large bets against national currencies. The first was in 1992, when he sold short the pound sterling and made a $1 billion profit in a single day. His next big currency speculation came in 1997.

Fledgling actors looking for work apply and audition at a run-down commercial building in LA where they meet the producer who introduces himself as Sam Bacile. In early august 2011 production begins on set in Duarte, 70 miles outside L.A aka the middle of nowhere. None of the actors know what the movies is about. None of the actors are given a full script and a vague story about slaves, warriors and chieftains is given. The actors are only told what to do in each scene right before shooting. One of the actors is told he is playing &quot;slave&quot; later he is told he is playing &quot;a warrior named Sampson&quot;. One actor is told he is playing the part of Abdo el Mutlab, a desert chieftain. When scripts are given they only show the scenes to be shot that day. Some actors didn&#039;t even know they had gotten the part and were called the day before and told to be on set at 7am the next day. The character who would later become Mohammed was referred to in script and on set as George which struck the actors as being odd. female extra in the film says, \u201cI asked, \u2018Who, 2,000 years ago in the Middle East, was named George?\u2019 And I was told, \u2018Oh, don\u2019t worry about it.\u2019\u201d<br><br>One actor says, \u201cI\u2019m a very, very white man.

Most of us were very white, very Caucasian.

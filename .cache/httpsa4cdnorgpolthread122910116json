The answer to New Soviet Man in the United Kingdom is a kind of therapeutic man - whose life is shorn of any moral considerations of his thoughts and behavior, he is simply identified as sick or healthy, which culminates in human creativity becoming synonymous with violence in the minds of people who are brutalized psychologically by a state that is entirely at odds with nature. The book identifies the cultural pathology of Liberalism, in other words. Its aged far better than other dystopian stories for this reason.","time":1493229150,"resto":122910116,"id":"wsJrEqX5","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122913128,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)13:53:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122911327\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122911327<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Um, the State of Israel?<\/span>","time":1493229217,"resto":122910116,"id":"xnj1B7lx","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122913218,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)13:54:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122910116\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122910116<\/a><br>You have to differentiate between nationalism and patriotism. <br>Orwell was quite a patriot and loved English culture and England.","time":1493229263,"resto":122910116,"id":"nSVNj3mm","country":"ME","country_name":"Montenegro"},{"no":122913285,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)13:54:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122910116\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122910116<\/a><br>He hated communism if anything.","time":1493229290,"resto":122910116,"id":"Z4N+vP2m","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":122913383,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)13:55:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122912447\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122912447<\/a><br>autist, Hitler would&#039;ve killed your ass already for going to such a degenerate site like this","time":1493229333,"resto":122910116,"id":"rBN5q7Sp","country":"MX","country_name":"Mexico"},{"no":122913539,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)13:56:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122911327\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122911327<\/a><br>Well shit, better start dancing the chakra and spinning some dredels since I hate nationalism.<br><br>What is wrong with globalism anyways?

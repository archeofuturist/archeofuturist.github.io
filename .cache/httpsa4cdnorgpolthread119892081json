We know the Neo-Cons\/Neo-Libs want Assad gone and were funding the jihadis for regime change. All public knowledge of the attack indicates a false flag - unless Trump is sitting on undeniable evidence that Assad just committed suicide by using gas like a brainlet moron. HOWEVER - it&#039;s irrelevant whether it&#039;s true or not in the grand scheme of things. <br><br>And this is why: <br>1. If it wasn&#039;t a false flag he responded appropriately. All he did was bomb an airfield storing the chemical weapons - targeting aircraft and infrastructure while avoiding personnel - after warning the Russians. No Russian casualties = No WWIII. Currently conflicting reports on SAA casualties - Pentagon says none, SAA says yes one dead. Doesn&#039;t matter. By targeting the air base and not Assad&#039;s headquarters (like Libya) he demonstrated this had NOTHING to do with regime change. Just sending a message.<br><br>2. He just put Assad in check while sedating Neo-Cons like McCain, liberals who want Assad gone, and Israel (who are the people who would have supported the false flag). He&#039;s winning over support from people stonewalling him with a glorified firework show. <br><br>3. He&#039;s being tough on China and North Korea. He was meeting with the leader of China today. By pulling the trigger unannounced like this he&#039;s showing he&#039;s not fucking around with North Korea. No doubt a message to Iran as well. <br><br>4. Even if Syrian forces are grounded they still have Russian air support. Essentially nothing has changed strategically speaking.<br><br>5. The momentary salt of some of his supporters will fade as the hysteria dies down when it&#039;s seen as it is - truly nothing of significance. He gets to keep them too. <br><br>6. Another nail in the coffin for the Russian collusion narrative","filename":"07695bb2b04f5eeb2e384a1d079558877d5d97c73e0c95a527009acd84e88d77","ext":".jpg","w":960,"h":960,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491543360550,"time":1491543360,"md5":"47ORw\/O2szyb2QftVgk1rA==","fsize":161386,"resto":0,"id":"vjHamrI3","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"reminder-they-are-doubling-down-on-their","country_name":"United States","replies":4,"images":3,"unique_ips":2},{"no":119892376,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)01:38:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"SHILLCON LEVEL 1<br><br>DON&#039;T LET THEM CALL YOU A NEO-CON THIS IS DEFINITELY 10D INTERGALACTIC BASKET WEAVING<br><br>BASICALLY<br>No regime change<br>No casualties = No WWIII<br>Puts Assad in check (assuming he&#039;s behind the gas attacks)<br>Wins over Neo-Cons, Libs w\/ some hot air<br>Sends the message he&#039;s not afraid to pull the trigger<br>Russia narrative dead for the 1000th time<br><br>itsnothing.jpg<br>Maybe some mobilizing by Russia in response to not look weak but it won&#039;t escalate.<br><br>IF TRUMP WAS A NEO-CON IN DISGUISE, THEY WOULD NOT HAVE FOUGHT HIM THIS HARD<br><br>SO THEY DON&#039;T STONEWALL HIM<br><br>He&#039;s appeased them with virtually NO RISK factor involved.

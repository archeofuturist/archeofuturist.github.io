Let me lay it out for you. Trump has been under surveillance since well before the election. Months upon months of surveillance. This is well established, as per Nunes&#039; report and even the NYT reporting, under the pretense of investigating any Russian collusion.<br><br>However, to this day, no such evidence has ever been presented, ever, and thus the only conclusion that can be drawn is that no such evidence existed. If there was any collusion, Obama would have brought it forth before the election, in the interim period prior to the election, or after the election. <br><br>It&#039;&#039;s almost like..... there is no evidence, because there was never any collusion.<br><br>Say hi to your boss, pedo.

And that would be a big problem because, basically, they all have.

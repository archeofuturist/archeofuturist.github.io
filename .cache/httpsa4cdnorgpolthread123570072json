The concept of humanity excludes the concept of the enemy, because the enemy does not cease to be a human being-and hence there is no specific differentiation in that concept. That wars are waged in the name of humanity is not a contradiction of this simple truth; quite the contrary, it has an especially intensive political meaning. When a state fights its political enemy in the name of humanity, it is not a war for the sake of humanity, but a war wherein a particular state seeks to usurp a universal concept against its military opponent. At the expense of its opponent, it tries to identify itself with humanity in the same way as one can misuse peace, justice, progress, and civilization in order to claim these as one&#039;s own and to deny the same to the enemy.&quot;<br><br>&quot;The concept of humanity is an especially useful ideological instrument of imperialist expansion, and in its ethical-humanitarian form it is a specific vehicle of economic imperialism. Here one is reminded of a somewhat modified expression of Proudhon&#039;s: whoever invokes humanity wants to cheat. To confiscate the word humanity, to invoke and monopolize such a term probably has certain incalculable effects, such as denying the enemy the quality of being human and declaring him to be an outlaw of humanity; and a war can thereby be driven to the most extreme inhumanity.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Humanity according to natural law and liberal-individualistic doctrines is a universal, i.e., all-embracing, social ideal, a system of relations between individuals. This materializes only when the real possibility of war is precluded and every friend and enemy grouping becomes impossible. In this universal society there would no longer be nations in the form of political entities, no class struggles, and no enemy groupings.&quot;<br><br>Carl Schmitt - The Concept of the Political","filename":"1475618719878","ext":".jpg","w":350,"h":200,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":71,"tim":1493610033753,"time":1493610033,"md5":"Br\/fvHueWfHorb9kfOBZKA==","fsize":38184,"resto":123570072,"id":"\/I9Hkzh9","country":"PT","country_name":"Portugal"}]}

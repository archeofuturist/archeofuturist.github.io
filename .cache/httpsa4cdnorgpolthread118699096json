Excerpt:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The paradox of rationalization\u2014the seemingly indissoluble internal relation between emancipation and subjugation\u2014that appears as an inevitable consequence of modernization is actually not a paradox at all. It appears as such, Habermas argues, only because in shifting the focus of analysis from disenchantment and the differentiation of value spheres to the processes of capitalist production and rational administration, Weber significantly narrowed the conception of rationality he employed and then proceeded to equate what was in fact a &quot;particular historical form of rationalization with rationalization as such&quot;. Horkheimer and Adorno adopt this Weberian perspective but not his ambivalence about the costs and benefits of rationalization. In their work the positive accomplishments of modernity disappear before the ever-expanding force of instrumental rationality.<\/span>","filename":"critical theory and political possibilities","ext":".jpg","w":307,"h":499,"tn_w":76,"tn_h":124,"tim":1490738617450,"time":1490738617,"md5":"pk4LWh1SIGci4SWBfPRYxw==","fsize":30600,"resto":118699096,"id":"QxTCjXTM","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118703786,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)18:05:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118699096\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118699096<\/a><br>The C# Yellow Book","time":1490738707,"resto":118699096,"id":"GdR5\/rzl","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

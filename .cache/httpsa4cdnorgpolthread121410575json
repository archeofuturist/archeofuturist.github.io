Look at how many cooking\/tennis\/basketball\/driving comics there are. They are all aimed at the people who have never touched any of these activities and once people start to learn parts of these activities they simply drop the comic for one with a different activity which in turn leads them to abandon the first activity in favour of the second.","time":1492376654,"resto":121410575,"id":"G68MZ2It","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121415954,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)17:17:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121410575\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121410575<\/a><br>Millennial blue-collar normies like it.

We do outsource alot of infrastructure related processes to other states\/countries. One of which became apparent to me just the other day. Our EBT food stamp system is outsourced to a non-idaho EBT vendor: (FIS) government solutions it used to be outsourced to JP Morgan. I think FIS is cheaper for the state, but I think we need to cut the cost completely and keep that money in idaho.","time":1492990250,"resto":122507167,"id":"3ZG6zzev","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122507991,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)19:32:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122507779\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122507779<\/a><br><br>again, Idahoans are just too stupid to do this<br><br>its the same problem with white nationalists wanting to create their own ethnostate: who is going to manufacture the drones for the military","time":1492990350,"resto":122507167,"id":"L1V0U8oA","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122508123,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)19:33:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122507167\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122507167<\/a><br>what is your political stance on the McChicken burger available at every local McDonalds eating house","filename":"mcdonalds-McChicken-","ext":".png","w":444,"h":340,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":95,"tim":1492990403057,"time":1492990403,"md5":"ANy8tmCm2SELf4M6CkWEug==","fsize":188374,"resto":122507167,"id":"Q2hQEjSX","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122508278,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)19:34:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122507167\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122507167<\/a><br>It&#039;s legal.

Conquest is the complete destruction and subjugation of another nation through war and pillaging. What America does is topple regime leaders and plant new ones. Not because it&#039;s more efficient or even to our gain but because it&#039;s the only thing Western countries can do after the Hitler story, after post modernism and nihilism. WW2 put such a stigma on all out war, so many people suffered that it changed the ethics and morality of the west. We literally don&#039;t conquer anymore, because we won&#039;t. The west will become continually weak century after century under this philosophy.","time":1492420406,"resto":121503548,"id":"E5oJMJKf","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121504899,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)05:16:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121504695\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121504695<\/a><br>Yes no one can go all rome on people now but still.<br><br>Replacing a leader with a friendly puppet who relies on the US to stay in power isn&#039;t conquest then what do you call it?","time":1492420590,"resto":121503548,"id":"9S5mb3Jm","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":121504904,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)05:16:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121503548\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121503548<\/a><br>I conquered your mums butt hole and accidentally liberated the skin of a pea","time":1492420594,"resto":121503548,"id":"R\/dQjagG","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":121504944,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)05:17:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121503548\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121503548<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;rebuilding the country you &quot;conquer&quot; while leaving the original population intact<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;conquest<\/span><br><br>are you fucking retarded?","filename":"1491951266520","ext":".jpg","w":620,"h":372,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":75,"tim":1492420620108,"time":1492420620,"md5":"X0K0mJtz8uddM88Xcgvp9A==","fsize":35462,"resto":121503548,"id":"nBiYKZ7y","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121505061,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)05:18:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121504944\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121504944<\/a><br>If some fantasy country (no real country can) replaced your leadership and rebuilt your country you wouldn&#039;t call it conquest of the US?

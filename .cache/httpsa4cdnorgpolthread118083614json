One of the arguments in favor of the historicity of the Baptism of Jesus by John is the criterion of embarrassment, i.e. that it is a story which the early Christian Church would have never wanted to invent. Another argument used in favour of the historicity of the baptism is that multiple accounts refer to it, usually called the criterion of multiple attestation. Technically, multiple attestation does not guarantee authenticity, but only determines antiquity. However, for most scholars, together with the criterion of embarrassment it lends credibility to the baptism of Jesus by John being a historical event.","time":1490365659,"resto":118083614,"id":"ReeKAgiq","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118085652,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)10:29:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118085411\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118085411<\/a><br>Don&#039;t you ever apologize to Pagan\/Neo-nazi trash.

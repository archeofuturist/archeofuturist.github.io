Think of it this way, science is the measure and study of the physical using observation and experimentation. By it&#039;s very nature it cannot presume to offer any substantial view on the metaphysical. You cannot materially quantify the immaterial.

Also- there is zero evidence for the existence of any of the 12 apostles or any of their supposed missionary work. It&#039;s a zodiac number. I have a copy of Biblical Archaelogy where they admit that there is not evidence any of the 12 apostles existed. Just like King David. Supposedly ruled the Kingdom of Jerusalem. In all of these decades of digging in the &quot;holy land,&quot; not ONE coin, statue, parchment, tablet nor anything admits the existence of King David. It&#039;s a jewish fairy tale. Nor Solomon for that matter. Not one contemporary historian admits the existence of either. Herodotus, the Father of History, traveled from Babylon to Egypt and recorded nothing in Judea but collections of mud huts. You would thing suck fabulous and great leaders would leave their mark in some way outside Jewish fairy tales.","time":1490367832,"resto":118083614,"id":"yrq8z+EP","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118089004,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)11:04:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"Jesus was a homosexual.","time":1490367847,"resto":118083614,"id":"pvU69mIm","country":"DK","country_name":"Denmark"},{"no":118089115,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)11:05:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118089004\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118089004<\/a><br><br>Says a &quot;man&quot; from denmark.","time":1490367904,"resto":118083614,"id":"UI5i2hjV","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118089154,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)11:05:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118088492\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118088492<\/a><br>The &quot;holy land&quot; is the most examined piece of worthless real estate on the planet.

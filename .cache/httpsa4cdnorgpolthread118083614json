By 130 B.C., under the Maccabees who were the high priests at Jerusalem, the people of Jerusalem had grown quite strong and after throwing off the yoke of the Greek rulers of Syria to whom they had been subject, they conquered all of the Canaanites and Edomites who had inhabited the surrounding areas, and forced them all to convert to the religion of Judah, already called by this time \u201cJudaism\u201d in the Greek and Roman tongues, and all of those people \u2013 Israel\u2019s traditional enemies \u2013 became known as Judaeans, or \u201cJews\u201d. Once converted to Judaism and practicing circumcision, it became quite easy for the true Israelites of Judaea (the descendants of the 40,000) to begin intermarrying with the Edomites and Canaanites of Judaea, and this time without any apparent religious guilt or criticism. By 80 B.C., many Edomites had gotten themselves into positions of power and authority in the kingdom of Judaea, and especially the family of Herod. By 40 B.C. the first Herod had become the de facto king of Judaea, having slain the last of the Maccabees, and being bribed by Herod, Marc Antony persuaded Octavius Caesar and the Roman Senate to make Herod the official king, about 36 B.C. Once Herod became king, the high priesthood and other positions at the Temple in Jerusalem became political tools, and over the years many of Herod\u2019s friends and kinsmen were granted appointments to such offices \u2013 a practice which continued until the Temple was finally destroyed in 70 A.D.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Understanding this history, it is evident how the Judaeans whom Christ reproved could claim to be Abraham\u2019s offspring, and yet Christ denies that they were true children of Abraham.

Describing the Israelites as \u201cvessels of mercy\u201d and the Edomites as \u201cvessels of destruction\u201d (Rom. 9:22-33), here he explains the reasons for the division among the first century Judaeans, also evident in many passages elsewhere, such as Rev. 2:9 and 3:9. Being, in part, descendants of Canaanites, they were also descendants of the Kenites \u2013 the children of Cain \u2013 and the Rephaim, all of whom mingled together (i.e. Gen. 15:19-21). This is why the Edomite Herod was representative of \u201cthe great red dragon ... that old serpent, called the devil, and Satan\u201d (Rev. 12) who attempted to kill the infant Christ, for the Kenites and the Rephaim were descendants of the serpent and the fallen angels of Genesis!<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;For this reason Yahshua Christ told those Judaeans whom He reproved that \u201cYe are of your father the devil\u201d (John 8:44), and \u201cBut ye believe not, because ye are not of my sheep, as I said unto you\u201d (John 10:26).

I sat next to Rand and was curious how this all went down. Trump turns around and says his plan to oust Ryan had come through. He mentioned the tweet from a few weeks ago, where his &quot;friend Rand Paul&quot; was going to make healthcare great. He mentioned that he was going to make Rand speaker. Well, that won&#039;t work. Rand is a senator. I realized I was having a Lynchian dream. A midget came up to the car, which I suddenly recognized to be a taxi. Rand sat silent still. The midget danced and Trump opened the passenger door. The midget entered the car and turns back to us. &quot;He&#039;s glad you are here. He knows you will return us to greatness. Have faith.&quot; Rand turns to me and says he will do his best, the circumstances are what they are and he must work in them. He will introduce a bill to the senate. I sit, silent, and stare into the long road ahead. Trump presses the gas. There&#039;s a sun rising in the horizon, as we pass millions of ghoul like people on the side of the road.<br><br>This was by far the most lucid and bizarre dream I&#039;ve had in years. It means nothing, but brought me hope that things will become great if I am patient.<br><br>Have you had any strange and relevant dreams lately, anon?","filename":"B1372EF6-3C19-4327-BCA0-F4E1B6BFF70B-9320-000007DB361AEBF1_tmp","ext":".jpg","w":267,"h":189,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":176,"tim":1490474209760,"time":1490474209,"md5":"u1ZvLSLypGOZ5PIcfn9qpg==","fsize":3717,"resto":0,"id":"H5zCYJ1l","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"last-night-i-had-a-dream-trump-was-driving-the","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

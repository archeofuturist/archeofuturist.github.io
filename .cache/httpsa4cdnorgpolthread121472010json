Normal people have a normal range of emotions and reactions that doesn&#039;t include built in ptsd like triggering as autusm has. So you&#039;re probably a bit autistic. There are many elements of conceptual thinking that autistic people have difficulty with. They take a good description (for a sheepherder) of shared genetics between men and women (a rib from adam) and because it&#039;s not a literal description they make fun of it while making themselves feel superior about something, because they usualy have an inferiority complex. Further autistic people tend to have brain abnormalities that cause difficulties understanding their own gender identities which causes them to be more likely to exeriment with gay sex, which they may lose interest in later as they are experiencing a stunted and delayed development including a stunted development of their own identity.

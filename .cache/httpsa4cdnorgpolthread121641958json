He bought oil from ISIS didn&#039;t he? But now that he has more power, he can bring back the death penalty which means Turkey can&#039;t join the EU.<br><br>Now our only hope for the EU collapsing is Le Pen winning in France. I don&#039;t see her winning the 2nd round tho, I&#039;m not sure. The fact that every Leftwing media seems to hate Erdogan also makes me happy he won somehow. 70% of roaches in my country voted yes in the referendum kek. Sorry if this makes no sense, I&#039;ve stayed up all night and tired as fuck.","filename":"IMG_0056","ext":".jpg","w":1000,"h":541,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":135,"tim":1492492020824,"time":1492492020,"md5":"5rM17hENr\/JVTQgA6f5P2w==","fsize":96891,"resto":0,"id":"YUsbUVS6","country":"NL","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"is-erdogan-winning-the-referendum-a-good-or-bad","country_name":"Netherlands","replies":15,"images":2,"unique_ips":9},{"no":121644067,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)01:27:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121641958\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121641958<\/a><br>Good question toothpaste<br>Bumping for interest","time":1492493262,"resto":121641958,"id":"mRv5ljm9","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":121644444,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)01:31:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121641958\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121641958<\/a><br>Turkey was never going to be allowed to join the EU.<br><br>Also, you&#039;re not so much gaining Turkey, you&#039;re trading Turkey for all the nations that would ragequit the EU if Turkey was allowed to join.","time":1492493463,"resto":121641958,"id":"LLdDMdbG","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121644529,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)01:31:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"I don&#039;t create a lot of threads, not sure if I can bump my own thread. \/Pol\/ is drowning in funny Antifa btfo threads which is fine, bur we need serious discussion too.","time":1492493518,"resto":121641958,"id":"YUsbUVS6","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":121644563,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)01:32:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121644444\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121644444<\/a><br>Witnessed","time":1492493539,"resto":121641958,"id":"mRv5ljm9","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":121644623,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)01:32:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121644444\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121644444<\/a><br>So only the east euros and not much else?<br><br>also checked","time":1492493571,"resto":121641958,"id":"D6b4PM8a","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121644721,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)01:33:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121644444\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121644444<\/a><br>Nice quints","time":1492493633,"resto":121641958,"id":"nuQRrWrZ","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121644793,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)01:34:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121641958\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121641958<\/a><br>The fact that Roaches in Netherlands have their own ethnic party that they&#039;re allowed to (and do) vote for is so mind-blowing to me.<br>We have lefty immigrant parties here but that is on a whole other level","time":1492493678,"resto":121641958,"id":"uSBJSTxJ","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121644846,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)01:35:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121644623\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121644623<\/a><br>Probably.

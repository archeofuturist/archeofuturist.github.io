He bought oil from ISIS didn&#039;t he? But now that he has more power, he can bring back the death penalty which means Turkey can&#039;t join the EU.<br><br>Now our only hope for the EU collapsing is Le Pen winning in France. I don&#039;t see her winning the 2nd round tho, I&#039;m not sure. The fact that every Leftwing media seems to hate Erdogan also makes me happy he won somehow. 70% of roaches in my country voted yes in the referendum kek.

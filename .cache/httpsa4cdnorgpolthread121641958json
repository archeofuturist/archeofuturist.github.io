He bought oil from ISIS didn&#039;t he? But now that he has more power, he can bring back the death penalty which means Turkey can&#039;t join the EU.<br><br>Now our only hope for the EU collapsing is Le Pen winning in France. I don&#039;t see her winning the 2nd round tho, I&#039;m not sure. The fact that every Leftwing media seems to hate Erdogan also makes me happy he won somehow. 70% of roaches in my country voted yes in the referendum kek. Sorry if this makes no sense, I&#039;ve stayed up all night and tired as fuck.","filename":"IMG_0056","ext":".jpg","w":1000,"h":541,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":135,"tim":1492492020824,"time":1492492020,"md5":"5rM17hENr\/JVTQgA6f5P2w==","fsize":96891,"resto":0,"id":"YUsbUVS6","country":"NL","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"is-erdogan-winning-the-referendum-a-good-or-bad","country_name":"Netherlands","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

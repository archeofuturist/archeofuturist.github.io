Girls have been pampered. They&#039;ve been given everything they wanted &amp; everything they&#039;ve asked for. <br><br>This creates a huge problem for society later on. These women move out of the house, graduate college, and eventually have to get married and start a family.<br><br>Well, who&#039;s gonna pay for all this shit now? Because I&#039;ll tell you what, their boyfriends and husbands won&#039;t be able to afford it -- at least not at first. At some point, these girls are gonna have to sacrifice some of these material things at the beginning if they want to build a life with someone. If they want to build a family. If they want to be wealthy later on in life. <br><br>So, what do the good girls do? They realize the true value of a dollar. The good girls get a degree and work hard. The good girls sacrifice and save for the future.<br><br>But a far larger number of girls these days don&#039;t do that. They become gold diggers. They go after rich guys with money instead of good guys that truly care about them, and they get fucked over. This is where the real cancer reveals itself. This is where women become radical, man-hating feminists; complaining about a glass ceiling and a mythical wage gap. They become these selfish, spiteful creatures all in the name of money and greed.<br><br>And thus you see the state of society today. The breakdown of traditional culture, a war between the sexes. It&#039;s disgusting and it&#039;s making everyone miserable.","filename":"0717-kendall-jenner-getty-4","ext":".jpg","w":700,"h":670,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":239,"tim":1493616210552,"time":1493616210,"md5":"TCjdPtO\/IAg2TFfXhRzsrw==","fsize":76317,"resto":0,"id":"KsM1LfJZ","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"feminism-materialism","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":123583328,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)01:27:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123583056\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123583056<\/a><br>I can see why you are still an autistic virgin","time":1493616424,"resto":123583056,"id":"9QUOtsrU","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

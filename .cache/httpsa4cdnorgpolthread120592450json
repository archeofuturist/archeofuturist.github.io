So United fucked up, and instead of paying for the crew to fly to their destination using another airline, or using one of their corporate jets, or paying for a private jet to fly them over (plenty of private companies specialize in flying airline crew to various airports), or to even just keep bumping up the amount (which they probably would have tried to pay in vouchers) until people volunteered, they decided to fuck over their paying customers to save a tiny amount of money.

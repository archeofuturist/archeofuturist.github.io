I present you what I call project T.A.R.D aka tactically advanced retard division. In the U.S 92% of babies with down syndrome are aborted, 6000 retarded babiew are actually born meaning 75000 retards are aborted each years in the US. We need to stop the anortion and instead make those 75000 tards go into militray. We will force them to go into intense mental and physical training to prepare for the great fight. Normal humans use 1\/3 of their muscles due to a safeguard in our bodies to prevent harm, you see the tards do not have this safe guard. Retard strength is very real and must be weaponized. On the battle field the enemy will be confused to see retards running around and before they have time to react BAM tard bombs go off killing them. So \/pol\/ can this work?","filename":"jason-receiving-his-end-of-service-awards-at-18yrs-9-months-dec-2010-3-months-before-he-died","ext":".jpg","w":238,"h":316,"tn_w":188,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490287395483,"time":1490287395,"md5":"5v8SBmnyLUSgR42XTyb+wg==","fsize":16377,"resto":0,"id":"mqyqOyLB","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"pol-i-had-an-epiphany-last-night-i-present-you","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

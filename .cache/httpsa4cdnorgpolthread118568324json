Their end goal is the UK becoming a low tax, light regulation, little welfare, offshore free market hub.<br><br>They want to get Brexit through first, and later on present that transformation as the only viable economic future for the country. Akin to how they sold off public entities like British Rail and soon to be the NHS, run the thing dry through underfunding and then point that the only way to fix it is privatisation.<br><br>Goodbye workers&#039; rights. Goodbye environmental protections. Goodbye British industry. Goodbye NHS.<br><br>The majority of people who voted for Brexit will get the opposite of what they actually want. Whether they realise or not (or admit it), and THEY are going to be the ones hit by Brexit more than anyone else. People have voted against something they&#039;re unhappy with (things that our entirely a result of domestic policy, not the EU) and they are only going to get EVEN MORE of it thanks to their vote. It&#039;s a fucking shambles.<br><br>Just look at Wales, why did Wales primarily vote leave the EU even though it is counter to its best interests? Poverty, that&#039;s why. Just like the highest leave voting areas of England.<br>It&#039;s straight up exploitation.<br><br>Brexit is about (most of) the media and politicians blaming the EU for our own problems for the last couple of decades, pure propaganda. Then we were asked if we wanted to leave. No shit did a load ocf people vote yes faced with that backdrop.

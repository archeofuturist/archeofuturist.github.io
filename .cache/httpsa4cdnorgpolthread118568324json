Their end goal is the UK becoming a low tax, light regulation, little welfare, offshore free market hub.<br><br>They want to get Brexit through first, and later on present that transformation as the only viable economic future for the country. Akin to how they sold off public entities like British Rail and soon to be the NHS, run the thing dry through underfunding and then point that the only way to fix it is privatisation.<br><br>Goodbye workers&#039; rights. Goodbye environmental protections. Goodbye British industry. Goodbye NHS.<br><br>The majority of people who voted for Brexit will get the opposite of what they actually want. Whether they realise or not (or admit it), and THEY are going to be the ones hit by Brexit more than anyone else. People have voted against something they&#039;re unhappy with (things that our entirely a result of domestic policy, not the EU) and they are only going to get EVEN MORE of it thanks to their vote. It&#039;s a fucking shambles.<br><br>Just look at Wales, why did Wales primarily vote leave the EU even though it is counter to its best interests? Poverty, that&#039;s why. Just like the highest leave voting areas of England.<br>It&#039;s straight up exploitation.<br><br>Brexit is about (most of) the media and politicians blaming the EU for our own problems for the last couple of decades, pure propaganda. Then we were asked if we wanted to leave. No shit did a load ocf people vote yes faced with that backdrop. They&#039;ve been convinced that everything from house prices, low wages, non-EU immigration, crime to health care issues are the fault of the EU.<br><br>There really is little more to it than that...","filename":"loi3b3l69ymy","ext":".jpg","w":639,"h":882,"tn_w":90,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490652595019,"time":1490652595,"md5":"BSJ1eZvBfCdP1a5YtmrEcw==","fsize":49587,"resto":118568324,"id":"7Ho\/RrSO","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118569776,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)18:11:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118569565\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118569565<\/a><br>fuck off commie","time":1490652706,"resto":118568324,"id":"olMcslaS","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118570030,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)18:13:46","name":"Anonymous","filename":"12418062_1527181164253358_6371647985854933759_n","ext":".jpg","w":480,"h":480,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490652826117,"time":1490652826,"md5":"nbf7Wvx5fTclmUTneoQM+g==","fsize":30947,"resto":118568324,"id":"olMcslaS","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118571408,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)18:25:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"filthy euro cuck traitors are voting for remain!","time":1490653518,"resto":118568324,"id":"olMcslaS","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118571609,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)18:27:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"B U M P","time":1490653627,"resto":118568324,"id":"EXkXexsP","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118572145,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)18:31:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118568324\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118568324<\/a><br><br>fucking bolton","time":1490653895,"resto":118568324,"id":"bMtyJ4bf","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118572258,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)18:32:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118569565\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118569565<\/a><br>kys","time":1490653947,"resto":118568324,"id":"77bFnEjm","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118572309,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)18:32:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"Done mate","filename":"HTVYKWW","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":1903,"tn_w":84,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490653969931,"time":1490653969,"md5":"qxBI8OnsxLj\/+kbi7rQJ0Q==","fsize":426111,"resto":118568324,"id":"NuLM9ybC","country":"GB","m_img":1,"country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118572508,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)18:34:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118569565\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118569565<\/a><br>yeah but when we buy things from America it will be cheaper now because of trade agreement so that makes up for everything.","time":1490654080,"resto":118568324,"id":"iSLUNn8h","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118572719,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)18:36:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;I would vote to remain<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;58%<\/span><br><br>JUST","filename":"mad farage","ext":".jpg","w":1520,"h":1013,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1490654178583,"time":1490654178,"md5":"fhXfKD+CiZpuFVARmQQYcA==","fsize":130663,"resto":118568324,"id":"7VKknY95","country":"FR","m_img":1,"country_name":"France"},{"no":118572823,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)18:37:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118572145\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118572145<\/a><br>its horrible mate,ive seen my neighborhood go from a nice area with nice folk with local businesses to becoming a small slice of pakistan","time":1490654233,"resto":118568324,"id":"olMcslaS","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118572869,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)18:37:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"Voted but the remainiacs are still ahead...","time":1490654256,"resto":118568324,"id":"6D0HbJCD","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118573931,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)18:46:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118572823\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118572823<\/a><br>sorry to hear that lad.<br>similar experience in my pocket of london.<br>I dont live there any more though","time":1490654788,"resto":118568324,"id":"bMtyJ4bf","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118576058,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)19:03:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118568324\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118568324<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;http:\/\/www.theboltonnews.co.uk\/new<wbr>s\/15184317.ONLINE_POLL__Ahead_of_Ar<wbr>ticle_50_notification_triggering_Br<wbr>exit__how_would_you_vote_now_\/<\/span><br>Done.

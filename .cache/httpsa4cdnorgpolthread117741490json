The cs meme &gt;Companies will always need computer programmers now a days <br>While this is true, colleges also know this, and looking to cash in to have this school. But at the same time the standards are greatly lowered, which makes competition for you much more difficult.<br><br>2. Most colleges in CS teach nothing of industry standards. Yeah you&#039;ll know what a data structure is and how to slove acedemic based problems but - what&#039;s that good for if you don&#039;t have a solid math background without any knowledge of frameworks that actually use these 1000x better.<br><br>Honestly cs is shit unless you have research\/intern experience and some good knowledge of IT.","time":1490175889,"resto":117741490,"id":"EAYgqh09","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

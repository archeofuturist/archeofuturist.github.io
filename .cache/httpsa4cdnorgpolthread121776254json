If you get at least 50% you win the spot. If you don&#039;t, then there is a new election in june between the two highest candidates. Dems got in total around 48% of the vote whereas Reps got around 52%. So when it goes to that election, they&#039;re fucked. On top of that, they just wasted 10 million dollars on this garbage and now have to do a new campaign, where the Republican will have tons of support and more money.","time":1492575100,"resto":121776254,"id":"BjrYA3oe","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121799299,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)00:11:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121799139\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121799139<\/a><br><br>WHERE THE FUCK ARE THEY ALL COMING FROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<wbr>OOOOOMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM","filename":"1479016358714","ext":".png","w":858,"h":725,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":105,"tim":1492575113909,"time":1492575113,"md5":"Bewrar8iq9z07XPMGK5YBw==","fsize":233272,"resto":121776254,"id":"JmDH780J","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121799309,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)00:12:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121798996\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121798996<\/a><br>He had to get &gt; 50% to get elected against other people on the ballot.

The change triggers an upheaval in the intangible mechanisms by which Washington runs: an incoming President is likely to be less familiar with formal structures, and the greater that gap, the heavier the responsibility of those advisers who are asked to fill it.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;This space has been traversed for nearly four months by Jared Kushner, whom I first met about 18 months ago, when he introduced himself after a foreign policy lecture I had given. We have sporadically exchanged views since. As part of the Trump family, Jared is familiar with the intangibles of the President. As a graduate of Harvard and NYU, he has a broad education; as a businessman, a knowledge of administration. All this should help him make a success of his daunting role flying close to the sun.<\/span><br><br><br>http:\/\/time.com\/collection\/2017-tim<wbr>e-100\/4742700\/jared-kushner\/","filename":"trueDetectiveS3","ext":".png","w":618,"h":412,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1492746017819,"time":1492746017,"md5":"iiNqfhbFzZUsOEpx7OveoQ==","fsize":429857,"resto":0,"id":"BZr7zwxc","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"name-a-better-duo","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":122090872,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)23:41:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"cowboy&#039;s o-line and Marshawn lynch in his prime","time":1492746100,"resto":122090715,"id":"\/Ea1yuW7","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

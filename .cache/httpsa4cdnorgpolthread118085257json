A bitter hatred of black men that boiled in his mind and consumed him. Then last week, apparently, he decided to kill them.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;By all accounts, Timothy Caughman, 66, was a benevolent man content with an unassuming life. He lived in a former single room occupancy residence that had been his longtime home. The son of a home health care aide and a pastor, he had worked in antipoverty programs in Queens. Religion and philosophy were constants in his conversations over unhurried meals of turkey bacon and grits at local diners.

He had been scavenging for cans in Midtown Manhattan around the corner from his home.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;At the arraignment, Joan Illuzzi, the prosecutor, said that Mr. Jackson was particularly offended by black men who were with white women. <\/span><br><br>I-is this was us \/pol\/acks are going to be when we reach 60 and realize we have done nothing with our lives?<br><br>https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2017\/03\/23\/<wbr>nyregion\/james-harris-jackson-timot<wbr>hy-caughman.html?","filename":"IMG_0414","ext":".png","w":2048,"h":1536,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1490365524051,"time":1490365524,"md5":"KjpOO23zCFTaXSnuxAjkTw==","fsize":1300779,"resto":0,"id":"dovUi5yz","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"gguys","country_name":"United States","replies":3,"images":1,"unique_ips":4},{"no":118085335,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)10:26:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118085257\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118085257<\/a><br>Confirmed psyop then?","time":1490365579,"resto":118085257,"id":"n9sS51he","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118085453,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)10:27:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118085257\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118085257<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;victim who cared for others <\/span><br><br>DINDU NUFFINS","time":1490365651,"resto":118085257,"id":"GvW32JjW","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118085658,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)10:29:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118085257\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118085257<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;At the arraignment, Joan Illuzzi, the prosecutor, said that Mr. Jackson was particularly offended by black men who were with white women. <\/span><br>Mummy","filename":"1490364338887","ext":".jpg","w":1917,"h":2230,"tn_w":107,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490365792937,"time":1490365792,"md5":"172eoDcbQFXusJ86XdP14g==","fsize":725069,"resto":118085257,"id":"k5c0ja0v","country":"IN","m_img":1,"country_name":"India"}]}

Also, information from such hearings might suggest changes to the release schedule. We should see at least one or two more major leaks in the lead up to the French elections since these leaks help build enthusiasm for nationalism generally. I expect that properly timed Wikileaks releases, even if they do not relate to France directly, would still push Le Pen&#039;s vote share up a few percent. They will probably release more frequently starting in mid-April, or at least that is what I would do. I would do a daily series in the week or two weeks leading up to the election, with one major release between now and then, if I were doing it.","time":1490073028,"resto":117576718,"id":"o\/8QrNFz","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117590815,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)01:11:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"Bump for happenings.

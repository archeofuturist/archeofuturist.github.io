The best goal scorers in the world like Dost, Higuain, Benzema, Ibra, and Ronaldo are basically just target men who don&#039;t even do much actual dribbling. So imagine if Ronaldo was 8 inches taller, had 100 extra pounds of muscle, had a 45 inch vertical, and was even faster and more agile. Thats Lebron. Someone like Lebron could score 50 goals a year in La Liga just off of corners.<br><br>Face it, \/pol\/. Americans have superior genetics whether you want to admit it or not.","filename":"1493583623233","ext":".jpg","w":634,"h":722,"tn_w":219,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493817479287,"time":1493817479,"md5":"SN2g6EK7BOMy3hqlYnMuOA==","fsize":106731,"resto":0,"id":"vN6YSc0g","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"do-you-guys-have-any-idea-how-much-top-american","country_name":"United States","replies":53,"images":5,"unique_ips":43},{"no":123911329,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)09:21:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123911106\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123911106<\/a><br>lower centre of gravity and agility are the key aspects of a good soccer player retard, it&#039;s a totally different game.","time":1493817669,"resto":123911106,"id":"tuJ32\/Yq","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":123911504,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)09:23:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123911106\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123911106<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;soccer<\/span><br>It&#039;s called football you spastic","time":1493817793,"resto":123911106,"id":"QcLs4Upv","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":123911626,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)09:24:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123911106\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123911106<\/a><br>you literally need a some kind of talent to be a real good player and God skills to get to Messi\/Maradona level.","time":1493817890,"resto":123911106,"id":"S5c1XpZ\/","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123911659,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)09:25:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123911106\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123911106<\/a><br>Nobody cares about your stupid sport fagot<br>Also, saged.","time":1493817913,"resto":123911106,"id":"+sUgNxbI","country":"IN","country_name":"India"},{"no":123911698,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)09:25:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123911106\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123911106<\/a><br>These blacks are built for basketball.

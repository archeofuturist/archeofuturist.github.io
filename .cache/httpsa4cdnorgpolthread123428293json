They made frequent purchases of Blacks including twelve in 1785, thirteen and then thirty-one in 1787, and eighty in 1768. <br><br>http:\/\/www.isjl.org\/mississippi-nat<wbr>chez-encyclopedia.html<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The most famous Jews to live in the area were the Monsanto brothers. Benjamin Monsanto owned 500 acres of land and 11 slaves. A friend of Spanish Governor Gayosa de Lemos, Benjamin Monsanto and his wife, Clara, had a home on St. Catherine\u2019s Creek until Benjamin\u2019s sudden death in New Orleans in 1794. In the 1790s, other Jews who came to the area included Abraham Buckholtz, who changed his name to Buckels. When the United States took over the Natchez territory in the late 1790s, peddler Henry Jacobs got full American citizenship, a first for the Jews of the area. <\/span><br><br>https:\/\/fitzinfo.wordpress.com\/2013<wbr>\/06\/28\/monsantos-zionist-agenda\/<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The 18th century Monsantos were slave traders. As automobile pioneer Henry Ford pointed out in his Dearborn Independent newspaper, the seed and grain industry was monopolized by Jews as far back as the early 20th century. There\u2019s little reason to believe that this monopoly has somehow changed hands. &quot;The grain syndicates which operate against the farmer are Jew-controlled. There is no longer any possibility of doubting, when the facts of actual affairs are put alongside the written Program, that the farmer of the United States has an interest in this [Jewish] Question.&quot;<\/span>","time":1493525492,"resto":123428293,"id":"7S8PBiYP","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123433937,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)00:12:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123432727\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123432727<\/a><br>Roundup is a vegetation killer.

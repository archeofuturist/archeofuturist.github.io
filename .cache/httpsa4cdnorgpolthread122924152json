It was his means to and end, the end being communism. It advocated for classless equality and shared productions. &quot;National Socialism&quot; was born in some ways as an opposition to Marxism. It threw out a lot of the Marxist ideas and advocated for a racial hierarchy, social Darwinism, and a rejection of foreign cultures and ideas. The main similarities are the name, obviously, and the authoritarian aspect of each. The end goal and internal systems are different though. One means to create an &quot;equal utopia&quot; while the other aims to maintain culture and racial purity.","time":1493234903,"resto":122924152,"id":"DRjTd6R\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122926368,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)15:31:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122925904\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122925904<\/a><br>It&#039;s also worth noting that socialism and communism were created as an alternative to capitalism.

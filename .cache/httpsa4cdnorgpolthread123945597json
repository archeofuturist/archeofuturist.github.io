Two<br>early Latin verse fragments indeed appear to set this category in the sky, and several later poets follow suit.39 The equation caeruleus =<br>\u2018sky-blue\u2019, however, is not correct.40 Many of these instances use<br>caeruleus explicitly as the property of a sky raining heavily, or<br>heavens about to open. Others are implicit. In the Georgics, for<br>example, Virgil describes as caeruleus color the colour of the sun<br>when it is about to deliver rain (pluuiam denuntiat).41 Several references<br>describe stars that herald rain.42 Caeruleus could denote stormclouds,43<br>and marked out the most watery parts of the rainbow (see<br>below pp. 40\u20131). It did not, however, describe the clear blue sky.4","time":1493843332,"resto":123945597,"id":"djVHYz1m","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123958654,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)16:29:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123958180\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123958180<\/a><br>the only one who&#039;s described as blonde is achilles and he&#039;s supposed to be a demigod, like a super saiyan","filename":"Greek_Phenotype","ext":".png","w":959,"h":422,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":55,"tim":1493843378474,"time":1493843378,"md5":"dKanv40hrFuWu0nefjjnZg==","fsize":508857,"resto":123945597,"id":"J0L0AGYv","country":"GR","country_name":"Greece"},{"no":123958696,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)16:29:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123958429\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123958429<\/a><br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sea_P<wbr>eoples<br><br>there&#039;s so much documentation of the invasions of 1200BC that I&#039;d be retarded to actually debate you on this","time":1493843394,"resto":123945597,"id":"WWHOR4xd","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

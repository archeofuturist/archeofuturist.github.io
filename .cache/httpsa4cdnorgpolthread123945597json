Two<br>early Latin verse fragments indeed appear to set this category in the sky, and several later poets follow suit.39 The equation caeruleus =<br>\u2018sky-blue\u2019, however, is not correct.40 Many of these instances use<br>caeruleus explicitly as the property of a sky raining heavily, or<br>heavens about to open. Others are implicit. In the Georgics, for<br>example, Virgil describes as caeruleus color the colour of the sun<br>when it is about to deliver rain (pluuiam denuntiat).41 Several references<br>describe stars that herald rain.42 Caeruleus could denote stormclouds,43<br>and marked out the most watery parts of the rainbow (see<br>below pp. 40\u20131). It did not, however, describe the clear blue sky.4","time":1493843332,"resto":123945597,"id":"djVHYz1m","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123958654,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)16:29:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123958180\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123958180<\/a><br>the only one who&#039;s described as blonde is achilles and he&#039;s supposed to be a demigod, like a super saiyan","filename":"Greek_Phenotype","ext":".png","w":959,"h":422,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":55,"tim":1493843378474,"time":1493843378,"md5":"dKanv40hrFuWu0nefjjnZg==","fsize":508857,"resto":123945597,"id":"J0L0AGYv","country":"GR","country_name":"Greece"},{"no":123958696,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)16:29:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123958429\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123958429<\/a><br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sea_P<wbr>eoples<br><br>there&#039;s so much documentation of the invasions of 1200BC that I&#039;d be retarded to actually debate you on this","time":1493843394,"resto":123945597,"id":"WWHOR4xd","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123958705,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)16:29:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123958541\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123958541<\/a><br>Looks like absolute shit.

It has no major mountain ranges, so no seasonal snow melt, so it has few rivers that vary significantly in navigability based on whether it&#039;s rainy or dry season. It sits upon a plateau which plunges to sea level near the coasts, so that few rivers are navigable from the ocean inland due to rapids and waterfalls. Most of the African coasts are surrounded by shallow sandbars that cannot support ocean-gong vessels and made for awful ports until modern dredging technology was developed. This is a major reason that Africa was the last continent to be colonized, despite being so close to Europe.

They spread throughout Europe, taking their culture and language with them. Their genetic contribution is represented by Y-DNA haplogroups R1A and R1B, which are at their highest concentrations in Russia, Poland, the British Isles, and parts of Spain. The reason why Scandinavians have fairer features is because the people living in those areas before the Indo-Europeans came happened to have fairer features.","time":1493844921,"resto":123945597,"id":"YYZr4SuH","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123962437,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)16:55:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123961449\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123961449<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;51 pages<\/span><br>wew lad<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The first paragraph explains the translation above, the Romans perception of color was odd and the author brings up texts that would speak of something tasting &#039;green&#039; when it&#039;s not the case. <\/span><br>That&#039;s all interesting but it doesn&#039;t answer my question.<br>Languages often have certain associations with certain words for colours, German compound words make that especially easy, but most modern languages have terms for colours which lost their root-connection.<br>Of course you can make up new ones &quot;pink&quot; tends to have feminine connotations, but that doesn&#039;t mean the same as &quot;english people don&#039;t know pink as a function.&quot;<br>I feel like it&#039;s similar with ruber (not rubor, which is a noun).

of Chinese civilization.[239] Gobineau argued that the Aryans being a conquering elite had taken a &quot;masculine rather than feminine&quot; approach to establishing their rule.[239] This in turn had led to a &quot;peaceful despotism&quot; well suited to the &quot;Malay disposition&quot; based on servility to the state, the capacity &quot;to grasp the advantages of a regular and co-ordinated state organization&quot; and an obsession with an &quot;exclusively material well-being&quot;.[240]<\/span><br><br>WE WUZ CHYNA N SHEEEIIITTTT","filename":"WeWUZEgypt","ext":".png","w":2034,"h":1216,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":74,"tim":1493845832120,"time":1493845832,"md5":"fbWvt5jedzE0+cpL2VkiAw==","fsize":3550022,"resto":123945597,"id":"1LgJeUZ1","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":123964687,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)17:10:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123964079\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123964079<\/a><br>its true though","time":1493845834,"resto":123945597,"id":"jahGoyW4","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":123964703,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)17:10:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123956710\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123956710<\/a><br>They pressed random in Oblivion character creation and took a screenshot.","time":1493845839,"resto":123945597,"id":"7kJEwXdw","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":123964719,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)17:10:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123958180\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123958180<\/a><br>Fun fact: Ramses ii of Egypt had red hair","time":1493845843,"resto":123945597,"id":"LndRY8nU","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123964739,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)17:10:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"&quot;nords are retarded and are niggers&quot;<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;responds with 5 paragraphs on why I&#039;m wrong<\/span><br>nordcucks can&#039;t take the bantz","time":1493845854,"resto":123945597,"id":"403xSzl6","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123964762,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)17:11:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123963419\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123963419<\/a><br>What the fuck does a bunch of colorless marble statues, a reenactor, and a picture of Ethan Klein prove?","time":1493845862,"resto":123945597,"id":"jEX6JJTq","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123964779,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)17:11:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123964495\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123964495<\/a><br>This is true, but I&#039;m talking about a specific class of them. <br><br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/White<wbr>_Turks_and_Black_Turks","time":1493845869,"resto":123945597,"id":"xL5zntAY","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123964810,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)17:11:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123964687\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123964687<\/a><br>How is it true when this very own thread proves you wrong?","time":1493845884,"resto":123945597,"id":"9h\/3rOV3","country":"GR","country_name":"Greece"},{"no":123964834,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)17:11:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123964613\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123964613<\/a><br>Obviously I was talking about the modern turk with 3% actual turk dna","time":1493845897,"resto":123945597,"id":"umJwcsDf","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":123964861,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)17:11:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123951621\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123951621<\/a><br>Chink tier architecture.

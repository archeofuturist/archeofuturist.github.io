The Left crafted its own culture (i.e. hippies, drugs, rock and roll, free love, etc.) and the Leftist ideology likewise rose. Looking at the state we are in now as the Right, what culture can we craft that we can bring into the real world, not just memes and &quot;kek,&quot; but something that can define this movement? What is the music of the right? What is the clothing? What can outwardly define us? (please don&#039;t be cynical, if we&#039;re going to get anywhere as a movement, we must transcend pure ideology and add culture)","filename":"089fbc2888c793fd83dc55e8f47e1d02","ext":".jpg","w":256,"h":755,"tn_w":84,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493428058414,"time":1493428058,"md5":"DXinmMmuxw25Gsv3hhxiZQ==","fsize":37888,"resto":0,"id":"6ZCMzx9x","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"what-is-the-culture-of-the-rightwing","country_name":"United States","replies":10,"images":2,"unique_ips":8},{"no":123274890,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)21:08:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"Personally, I think that Synthwave may be one of our types of music.

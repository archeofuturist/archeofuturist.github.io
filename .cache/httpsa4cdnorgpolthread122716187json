It\u2019s not a fucking puzzle, all the history is on the sites. There you crossed ur nerdy hobbies with ur nerdy resentment. Bunch of fucking nerds with your dipshit teenage beefs probably started with a resentment of woman who won\u2019t speak to you and now you think you have become POI radicalized. So how did it happen? How did you become a fucking nazi? A bunch of real Nazis whispered poison in your ears while becoming your only community, your only \u201cfriends\u201d. And they used multiple levels to make irony and bigotry and fascism more acceptable by drowning it in \u201coh we\u2019re just joking\u201d So you combine all this with capitalizing on isolated nerd dude resentment and even deeper isolation, BAM nazi. You can talk to any former \u201cchan\u201d boy and they can tell you how it went from \u201cshotty shock humor\u201d to \u201cwhite supremacist recruitment\u201d. The \u201clol only normies care about hurting others attitude\u201d + the general nerd male resentment of these communities. Its prime fertile ground for actual Nazis to grow. People talk about pol, but you need to see the various communities converge. R9K\u2019s \u201cwho wont woman fuck me\u201d bs \u201canything goes and anyone who gets mad is just a normie\u201d vs endless outbursts of anger at everything. Pol here becomes less of an isolated phenomenon and more of a natural end point for all these circles crashing into one another. And pol, also being its own thing, emans it is rolled back into those communities amplifying your worst aspect then roll it back into pol. So essentially you have an online pressure cooker to turn your typical teenage nerdy bullshit into honest to god fascism. The surrounding of hateful idedas, the detachment from the harm you do? Turning them into \u201cjust jokes\u201d becoming your only friends and that just your community you can see it in many others but again your not a fucking mystery.","time":1493114214,"resto":122716187,"id":"sbB3hj+r","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":122718052,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)05:57:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122716187\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122716187<\/a><br>Because artists gonna art, otherwise they&#039;d be doing a real job.<br>Deal with it like the rest of us.","time":1493114234,"resto":122716187,"id":"IsC8V78q","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":122718070,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)05:57:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122717829\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122717829<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;communism doesn&#039;t have hate and violence written all over it!<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;literally every rally where commies are present ends up becoming violent<\/span><br><br>jebem ti mater","time":1493114255,"resto":122716187,"id":"awawENK3","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":122718096,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)05:58:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"Because communism appeals to losers betters","filename":"1493087881128","ext":".png","w":966,"h":466,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":60,"tim":1493114281699,"time":1493114281,"md5":"QE+xiNHwk+AAsQqQX97Qnw==","fsize":134839,"resto":122716187,"id":"SIbD3Koq","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122718114,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)05:58:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122717522\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122717522<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;communism never genocide anyone<\/span><br><br>That&#039;s where you&#039;re wrong, kiddo<br><br>China:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; In 1976, the U.S. State department estimated as many as a million were killed in the land reform, and 800,000 killed in the counter-revolutionary campaign.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mao himself claimed that a total of 700,000 people were killed in attacks on &quot;counter-revolutionaries&quot; during the years 1950\u201352.However, because there was a policy to select &quot;at least one landlord, and usually several, in virtually every village for public execution&quot;, the number of deaths range between 2 million] and 5 million.

The abolition of private property is suicide to a society. Yes, as IDEALS, communism sounds great. Hell, i like it. In practice humans are ... human. They are hierarchical. They are selfish. They are individualist. There is diffusion of responsibility when too many people are responsible for the same thing. Things go to shit when &quot;everyone&quot; has power\/responsibility for a certain thing. In practice that turns very rapidly into &quot;no-one has power or responsibility for a certain thing. Please talk to any east -European if you have doubts.<br><br>This is why i say communism (true or false) is structurally flawed. Authoritarianism is also an inevitable consequence of communism. <br>It is not an unfortunate happening that all anarcho\/sindiclaist\/liberterian\/wha<wbr>tever communists were removed from power in russia\/east europe. It is a direct consequence of trying to forcefully remove private property from people. Because the only way to do it is by force (unless everyone agrees to do it witch is almost never the case, unless we are talking about very small groups).

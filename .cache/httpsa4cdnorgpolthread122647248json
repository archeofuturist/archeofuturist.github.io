The intelligence gap is genetic. And environment, economic status, and education all have very minor effects compared to your genes. He goes on to say the controversy over this is simply a &quot;moral panic&quot; on the left that this issue is even being discussed at all. <br><br>Most people here already know this stuff, but hearing a public figure like Harris say it is still shocking. <br><br>It&#039;s all pretty good but if you are just looking for the TL;DL version then just listen to the first 9 minutes.","filename":"1492983018786","ext":".jpg","w":400,"h":400,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493072231101,"time":1493072231,"md5":"3fH1Di67wa34duuGGcTvsA==","fsize":14880,"resto":0,"id":"Q4leXqlO","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"sam-harris-takes-the-red-pill-on-race-and","country_name":"Canada","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

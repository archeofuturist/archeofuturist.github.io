Then I got a job in retail and customer service to work my way through college. The majority of people are disgusting, self-centered, lazy, and just plain dumb. The basic foundational presumption of liberalism is false. People are not rational. The aberage bubba bill or blue-haired cunt should not be allowed to dictate policy on anything. However, I reside in the quasi-democratic republic camp only because it does only the 15% of people who care about issues to have a say in politics and there has yet to be a better &quot;freer&quot; system.","time":1490266827,"resto":117918257,"id":"H5RxdsB\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117922442,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)07:52:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117918872\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117918872<\/a><br>This.","time":1490269976,"resto":117918257,"id":"s6Zby0PQ","country":"AT","country_name":"Austria"}]},{"posts":[{"no":117917872,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)06:46:32","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Erdogan threatens Europeans, The Brotherhood Question","com":"The sooner the world realizes that the Muslim Brotherhood is a terrorist organization, that Turkey is a brotherhood state, and that the brotherhood is a NATO member, the better.

They are all totalitarians, and they will ditch democracy and human rights once it does its job of handing them the reins of power.

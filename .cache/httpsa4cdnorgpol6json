One thing I have to admit I never really connected to is the idea of charity or service -- NOT because I lack empathy, but rather because it seemed almost strange to me to focus on, say, feeding a homeless person, when there are all these other problems that are &quot;closer&quot; to me that need fixing -- helping the people in my own life with their struggles, illnesses, grief, etc., being a better person for my family, and that sort of thing. It almost seemed arbitrary to think of going out and putting my energy toward a problem removed from my own life when there&#039;s always so much &quot;at home&quot; that needs that kind of care. <br><br>Today, however, it struck me in a new way. As I look at the world around me, I can&#039;t help but feel that humanity is an unsolvable problem. I&#039;m sure I don&#039;t need to elaborate on what I mean by that. So I&#039;m suddenly seeing this call to service as an answer to that. It&#039;s unsolvable at the macro level, but as an individual, I can spread truth, mercy, and grace wherever I go, and there is no place that doesn&#039;t need those things, and that is what saves us, in a way, because the world will never be &quot;saved&quot; in the way we want it to be.<br><br>I&#039;d be curious to hear what other Christians think.

The world we see is an epiphenomenon that arises out of consciousness. This geometry is an infinite grid of one shape, being drafted by a cosmic drafter scribing circles at infinitum (god). This produces the flower of life geometry, which produces the tetragrammaton. The final shape is an isotropic ve tor matrix that can collapse, fold into itself and create again. The replication plenum is quadrilateral btw. In this infinite grid all matter, energy, and i formation in all of the universe moves at superluminal spped, thus it is everywhere and nowhere simultaneously.

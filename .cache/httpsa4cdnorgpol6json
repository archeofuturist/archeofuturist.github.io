All you hear is &quot;reee racist&quot; <br><br>Who is responsible for the state of their own countries? Ok let&#039;s say they migrate to europe or the US, who is then responsible for the state of those countries? Not them either i guess? so if it goes bad somehow, they will migrate to other place and say &quot;ah i wasn&#039;t responsible for that situation in that country where i migrate from&quot; Well who is then? A magic fairy?<br><br>Why is it fair that they instead of sorting out their own nations want to migrate to majority white nations and ethnically displace whites there.

Why because taxes have to be increased to pay for them and their kids, which means some swedes will not be able to afford having kids. _Many_ of them are also illiterate even in THEIR OWN LANGUAGE, no skills no nothing. You simply can&#039;t afford that either. And those that have some education take jobs away from native swedes who otherwise would need them. Then they have higher birthrates because that&#039;s what they do in their neck of the woods, which is part of why they are poor back in their own nations.. Because funnily enough when you have 5x more people who need jobs, not everyone can get them especially if you don&#039;t have that many companies back in your home nation.. <br><br>I want to hear a proper argument why these people should not be essentially forced to stay in their home nations, even letting the smart ones of them leave is bad because that would be precisely the ones who could start up businesses and improve their nations.","filename":"1490831688227","ext":".png","w":326,"h":291,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":223,"tim":1491210046397,"time":1491210046,"md5":"jcVy7UuNfw5CVWtdd7BaAA==","fsize":38490,"resto":0,"id":"W6Fx8wEu","country":"DK","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"why-shouldnt-non-whites-in-general-stay-in-their","country_name":"Denmark","replies":110,"images":10,"omitted_posts":105,"omitted_images":8,"tail_size":50},{"no":119320354,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)08:04:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119319766\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119319766<\/a><br><a href=\"#p119320053\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119320053<\/a><br>Of course, it&#039;s not as bad with high-skill jobs, but it&#039;s also not that great still.

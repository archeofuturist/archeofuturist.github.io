Atheism is in decline worldwide, with the number of atheists falling from 4.5% of the world&#039;s population in 1970 to 2.0% in 2010 and projected to drop to 1.8% by 2020, <br><br>Real surveys and statistics say atheism is on the decline worldwide. Sorry atheists but atheism is not on the rise nor is it winning. It&#039;s still the minority and a declining one at that. <br><br>The Pew Research Center&#039;s statistics show that atheism is expected to continue to decline all the way into 2050 with a continued growth of religion. Other research also shows a huge surge in growth for Christianity in China which is currently the world&#039;s most &quot;atheist&quot; nation because of the atheist communist government suppressing religion, the research suggests that China will soon become the world&#039;s most Christian nation within 15 years. <br><br>This is simply history repeating itself: Christianity prospered in Rome back in the ancient era when it was suppressed and it still grew in the militant atheist soviet Russia when it was suppressed there only a century ago with the majority of Russians today now also identifying as Christian. Just goes to show that atheist suppression of religion still doesn&#039;t stop religion.<br><br>Sources for the legion of whiny \/Redditor\/ fedoras that will no doubt show up it this thread:<br><br>http:\/\/www.pewforum.org\/2015\/04\/02\/<wbr>religious-projections-2010-2050\/<br>http:\/\/www.pewforum.org\/2012\/12\/18\/<wbr>global-religious-landscape-unaffili<wbr>ated\/<br>http:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/news\/wor<wbr>ldnews\/asia\/china\/10776023\/China-on<wbr>-course-to-become-worlds-most-Chris<wbr>tian-nation-within-15-years.html<br>http:\/\/masterrussian.com\/russia\/fac<wbr>ts.htm","filename":"E03D48E5-8C5F-4349-BC2D-CDB7F5D3B7F8","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":819,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":199,"tim":1492757623333,"time":1492757623,"md5":"kCgMrJA19o2yCW7FiQWNug==","fsize":142136,"resto":0,"id":"9TSd5qvL","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"atheism-is-the-fastest-shrinking-religion-in-the","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":23,"images":2,"omitted_posts":18,"omitted_images":2},{"no":122112791,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)04:01:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"Faith is when you believe someone because you are afraid your friends will call you a fag for not believing someone...","time":1492761717,"resto":122108607,"id":"bkf1CbXU","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122112815,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)04:02:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122108607\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122108607<\/a><br>Argumentum ad populum","time":1492761738,"resto":122108607,"id":"soOLlybx","country":"HU","country_name":"Hungary"},{"no":122112892,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)04:03:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"Fear is the mindkiller and hope is his knife.","time":1492761826,"resto":122108607,"id":"bkf1CbXU","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122113188,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)04:08:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"&quot;&quot;&quot;<br>At the same time, however, the unaffiliated are expected to continue to increase as a share of the population in much of Europe and North America.

I am certain that mainstream media has taken leads from \/pol\/ and sourced stories from here, and I&#039;m not just talking about the sensational ones. I know for a fact that myself and others have influenced peoples religious awareness here and even been instrumental in persuading them to seek direction from one of the Christian Religious Traditions. What bothers me though is how this precious vent of otherwise peripheral political opinion is wasted.<br><br>In this age of the Internet and the free movement of information a forum such as this could become a beacon of free speech, but because of the rabid hatred that&#039;s spewed here it is a pariah. It&#039;s not gone unnoticed by me that any thread that shows signs of having real substance in a world of illusion and distraction can and does get pruned, it&#039;s nevertheless interesting that they are still often archived. They make interesting reading while they&#039;re up though and it&#039;s why I keep coming back.<br><br>So this is an appeal to informed, historically aware people with a decent memory of recent contemporary events going back to the breakdown in US\/Russia relationships to offer a concise appraisal of what they&#039;ve noticed and where they see these events leading. I&#039;ve been predicting War since the mid nineties and if anyone picks this up I&#039;ll tell you why.<br><br>God is Great","filename":"reset to overcharge","ext":".jpg","w":885,"h":516,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":145,"tim":1492757574612,"time":1492757574,"md5":"jfSdxbZQ\/PSwXA00RhBE4A==","fsize":61978,"resto":0,"id":"Ol\/m9e0T","country":"PL","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"pol-is-a-priceless-forum-where-its-permitted-to","country_name":"Poland","replies":26,"images":10,"omitted_posts":21,"omitted_images":9},{"no":122112099,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)03:48:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;influenced peoples religious awareness here and even been instrumental in persuading them to seek direction from one of the Christian Religious Traditions<\/span><br><br>oh look its a christcuck thread.<br>these are almost worse than all the black cock threads.<br><br>sage","filename":"pepe0012","ext":".jpg","w":910,"h":684,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1492760925663,"time":1492760925,"md5":"KdvtQkVYPTgR6YpaR27Nxg==","fsize":102075,"resto":122108546,"id":"L\/yMJeRz","country":"HK","country_name":"Hong Kong"},{"no":122112591,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)03:57:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122111958\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122111958<\/a><br><br>&quot;It will lead to nothing but trouble&quot;<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What is America?<\/span><br><br>The &quot;White Race&quot; has doomed itself by trying to make everyone the same with the result you are going to lose your Self.

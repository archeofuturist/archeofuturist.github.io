Witnesses testified that over two days in July 2015, members of the group, which called itself &quot;Respect the Flag,&quot; shouted the N-word at black motorists and harassed customers at local businesses. At one point the group drove onto the property of a black resident who was holding a birthday party for an 8-year-old child, shouting death threats and pointing a gun. Members of the group were found guilty of violating a street-gang terrorism law, with prison sentences of up to 13 years. <br><br>https:\/\/www.democracynow.org\/2017\/3<wbr>\/2\/headlines\/georgia_final_sentence<wbr>s_handed_down_in_white_supremacist_<wbr>terror_case","filename":"Screen Shot 2017-04-17 at 11.06.06 PM","ext":".png","w":1468,"h":1098,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":186,"tim":1492463346061,"time":1492463346,"md5":"G5YxXBoi0GvtAraqdHvq6Q==","fsize":1305728,"resto":0,"id":"v2GUH5uF","country":"DE","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"yeah-americans-really-got-this-massive-freedom-of","country_name":"Germany","replies":15,"images":1,"omitted_posts":10,"omitted_images":0},{"no":121585908,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)17:33:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121585449\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121585449<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121585594\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121585594<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121585787\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121585787<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121583797\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121583797<\/a><br><br>I&#039;ll say it again, the retarded whites ADMITTED to brandishing and threads straight out of the gate.<br><br>This story is old as shit.","time":1492464799,"resto":121582515,"id":"hVhzmcWn","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121586109,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)17:34:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121582515\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121582515<\/a><br>We don&#039;t want other countries niggerfied, you retarded kraut.","time":1492464883,"resto":121582515,"id":"aZJ7uEal","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121586273,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)17:35:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Germany.<\/span><br><br>Good for you, Abdul. <br><br>I heard you can even point guns at people threatening to kill them.","time":1492464955,"resto":121582515,"id":"Wg0G7AV+","country":"SK","country_name":"Slovakia"},{"no":121586449,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)17:37:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"The guy on the left has a Spanish name.

And we rained down on them a shower (of brimstone)&quot; - An account that is borrowed from the Biblical story of Sodom. Muslim scholars through the centuries have interpreted the &quot;rain of stones&quot; on the town as meaning that homosexuals should be stoned, since no other reason is given for the people&#039;s destruction. (Inexplicably, the story is also repeated in suras 15:74, 27:58 and 29:40).<br>Quran (7:81) - &quot;Will ye commit abomination such as no creature ever did before you?&quot; This verse is part of the previous text and it establishes that homosexuality as different from (and much worse than) adultery or other sexual sin. According to the Arabic grammar, homosexuality is called the worst sin, while references elsewhere describe other forms of non-marital sex as being &quot;among great sins.&quot;<br><br>Quran (26:165-166) - &quot;Of all the creatures in the world, will ye approach males, &quot;And leave those whom Allah has created for you to be your mates?

The original Arabic does not use the word &quot;men&quot; and simply says &quot;two from among you.&quot; Yusuf Ali may have added the word &quot;men&quot; because the verse seems to refer to a different set than referred to in the prior verse (explicitly denoted as &quot;your women&quot;). In other words, since 4:15 refers to &quot;your women&quot;, 4:16 is presumably written to and refers to men.<br><br>should be plenty of ammo for the night<br><br>have fun and try to convert a few, before getting chased out of there","time":1490308076,"resto":117991652,"id":"14FkPr6v","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":117971683,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)15:32:02","name":"Anonymous","sub":"HEALTHCARE VOTE CANCELLED","com":"UTTERLY<br><br>FUCKING<br><br>DRUMPFD","filename":"2016-03-04-bd0675f9_large","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":300,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490297522444,"time":1490297522,"md5":"UHdO4mvih8ShTn5d3f7rFQ==","fsize":57212,"resto":0,"id":"2tYU5TrZ","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"healthcare-vote-cancelled","country_name":"United States","replies":292,"images":112,"omitted_posts":287,"omitted_images":109,"tail_size":50},{"no":117993605,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)18:20:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117979356\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117979356<\/a>","filename":"1489941395418","ext":".png","w":502,"h":410,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":102,"tim":1490307623782,"time":1490307623,"md5":"y4R5HUYODNJ4EhjTES\/hZQ==","fsize":100793,"resto":117971683,"id":"\/lpYGO9M","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":117993652,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)18:20:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117993293\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117993293<\/a><br><br>It&#039;s because to them, Trump is just incapable of looking bad ever.<br><br>It&#039;s like how black people for the most part won&#039;t ever shit on Obama too much.

Outside of Europe, they are very popular in some South American countries, notably in Argentina and Uruguay. Electronic bidet-integrated toilets, along with functions like toilet seat warmers, are commonly found in Japan.<br>In northern Europe, bidets are rare, although in Finland bidet showers are common.[7] Bidet showers are also common in South-East Asia, South Asia and parts of the Middle East.<br>In 1980, the first &quot;paperless toilet&quot; was launched in Japan by manufacturer Toto,[8] a combination of toilet and bidet which also dries the user after washing. These combination toilet-bidets (washlet) with seat warmers, or attachable bidets are particularly popular in Japan and South Korea, found in approximately 60% of households.[citation needed] They are commonly found in hotels and even some public facilities. These bidet-toilets, along with toilet seat and bidet units (to convert an existing toilet) are sold in many countries, including the United States.<br><br>MUCH LIKE INDIANS CANNOT POO IN LOO, AMERICANS SMEAR SHIT AROUND THEIR ASS WITH TOILET PAPER LIKE SUB HUMANS.<br><br>BIDETS ACTUALLY CLEAN THE ASSHOLE AND ARE VERY HYGIENIC.<br><br>I bought a bidet attachment for my toilet on amazon from the link below for $35 and it is life changing.<br><br>https:\/\/21stcentury-living.com\/2017<wbr>\/04\/02\/why-your-home-and-toilet-nee<wbr>ds-a-bidet\/","filename":"bidet today","ext":".jpg","w":800,"h":800,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491357750720,"time":1491357750,"md5":"uts9XgEdRnUn0WGBUrI0cg==","fsize":78817,"resto":0,"id":"ajtgVxXk","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"united-states-should-mandate-bidets-like-italy","country_name":"United States","replies":14,"images":3,"omitted_posts":9,"omitted_images":3},{"no":119554660,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)22:35:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119550965\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119550965<\/a><br>Just wet your toilet paper under the sink","filename":"1468341222079","ext":".jpg","w":711,"h":711,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491359740684,"time":1491359740,"md5":"s+yuiKp8S\/VeMSwbLLRNBQ==","fsize":154941,"resto":119550965,"id":"iqNeM2ep","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":119554996,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)22:38:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119550965\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119550965<\/a><br>What if you get shit on the bidet?

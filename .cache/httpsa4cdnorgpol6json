You don&#039;t understand the covenant.<br><br>2.) Liberal Jews in Europe and America differ ideologically from Jews in Israel.<br><br>3.) Not all Jews are liberal, and not all Jews have opinions on &quot;race mixing&quot;, but so long as you have some kind of descent from the tribes of Israel you&#039;re golden. Percentage not important. Non-Jewish spouses are fine after they convert to Judaism. <br><br>4.) Answer probably differs Jew-to-Jew but I&#039;ve never met one who said not to marry Europeans. They just have to convert first.<br><br>5.) Judaism is not just an ethnic group. It&#039;s a religion and culture passed down through ancestry, which has caused some distinct genetic hallmarks, but these are just effects and not causes. Ashkenazi Jews have some genetic markers, but the markers are because of their lifestyle in Medieval Europe, and aren&#039;t used to quantify &quot;how Jewish&quot; they are. This doesn&#039;t answer the question specifically because the question is dumb. Some soccer players are white, so why isn&#039;t it okay to be pro-white if it&#039;s okay to be pro-soccer?<br><br>6.) You&#039;re assuming Jews are all liberal again, and also that all Jews are anti-nationalism. Jews are fundamentally nationalistic with regards to Israel. Wanting to go back to Zion is mentioned in every other prayer. In diaspora, though, nationalistic sentiment gets irritating when you don&#039;t have a nation, so a stigma for nationalism developed. Now Jews have a country that they almost worship, but the stigma remains. <br><br>7.) Different calendar because of history, different holidays because of religion. Plus, holidays are distinct from race. Celebrating Christmas does not make you white. Not all Europeans celebrate all European holidays. Some Jews are genetically European, and for them, European holidays might be celebrated as long as they don&#039;t get in the way of Jewish ones.<br><br>Source: am Jew","filename":"1487037343587","ext":".jpg","w":677,"h":995,"tn_w":85,"tn_h":124,"tim":1491936975730,"time":1491936975,"md5":"vVYSn4wuAqq4DSiUM\/hhFQ==","fsize":106538,"resto":120630965,"id":"k6Kjfxgg","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":120634197,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)14:35:05","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Neoconservatives","com":"Why does \/pol\/ shit on neoconservatives when they have objectively the best ideology?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;pride in their nation<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;unlike libertarians, actually care about moral traditions and don&#039;t bend over for degenerates<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;unlike the alt-right, realize that protectionism is shit(as do the majority of economists)<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;unlike libertarians, realize war is necessary at times<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;unlike lefties, still believe in defending borders<\/span>","filename":"Bush","ext":".jpg","w":596,"h":489,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":205,"tim":1491935705938,"time":1491935705,"md5":"mhhhkkDT6P7WZwTBw00JWA==","fsize":54171,"resto":0,"id":"sul2B6e\/","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"neoconservatives","country_name":"Canada","replies":12,"images":2,"omitted_posts":7,"omitted_images":0},{"no":120636400,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)14:49:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"Liberal kikes who were kicked out of the democratic party","time":1491936598,"resto":120634197,"id":"1JIAE3oS","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120636612,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)14:51:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120636202\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120636202<\/a><br>Best deffence is offence","time":1491936694,"resto":120634197,"id":"quNgzhHp","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":120636837,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)14:52:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120634197\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120634197<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;proud nationalists<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;morals<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;defend borders<\/span><br>wrong on all counts \/thread","time":1491936776,"resto":120634197,"id":"WYtoaBBf","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120637290,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)14:56:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120634197\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120634197<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Oy vey goyim!

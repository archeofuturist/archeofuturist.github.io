My son came out as gay and I told him I didn&#039;t want him living under my roof anymore. He moved in with his Jaiden and he&#039;s dead to me. But I have no shame in saying that I visit 4chan escorts and have blown my load many times in their tight asses. I even have a couple of beautiful Alt -lighters who do dom work and they throatfuck me, let me rim their holes and come all over my face. This has nothing to do with being divided. They are women with penises. The penis itself is not male, it&#039;s attached to a woman.<br><br>A FLAG IS A PIECE OF TROPHY ! A piece of my flag does not affect my sexuality. Do you let someone call you a pervert if your penis touches a pork chop? No. It wouldn&#039;t mean you were a porcinesexual.<br><br>A penis is flesh. A beautiful lady having a different shape of flesh will not change my sexuality. No matter how many of them I let inside me or how many I beg for their seed. I don&#039;t need to be called gay by narrow minded busybodies. How come this concern for policing sexuality only happens to straight men. <br><br>For sake of fuck, DO YOU REALLY THINK JAIDEN SMITH WAS IN HOUSES IN LONDON HAVING SEX WITH LADYBOYS he could afford it but no he was a gay he liked men he would never be with a transgoddess because he realised they were women. Maybe if he would have avoided all gay activity and stayed with traps he would still be with us today, the dirty faggot God rest his soul. I will not be divided , my son is your god , long live the LeBoufs","filename":"IMG_0558","ext":".png","w":640,"h":1136,"tn_w":140,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490882700261,"time":1490882700,"md5":"+2apH\/RsMUCkpdgVWq\/vYA==","fsize":466583,"resto":0,"id":"3zOBBc2S","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"pls-stop-bullying-my-beloved-son-and-his","country_name":"United States","replies":9,"images":3,"omitted_posts":4,"omitted_images":1},{"no":118925642,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)10:32:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118923319\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118923319<\/a>","filename":"1490424515775","ext":".gif","w":406,"h":300,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":92,"tim":1490884323560,"time":1490884323,"md5":"P8h34kyDldM9iNgUhm8XJw==","fsize":3327155,"resto":118923319,"id":"eCE0w1ZV","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118926431,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)10:40:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118923319\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118923319<\/a><br>MY WIVES SON<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;MY WIVES SON<\/span><br>MY WIVES SON<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;MY WIVES SON<\/span><br>MY WIVES SON","filename":"Cuck shed","ext":".jpg","w":1388,"h":858,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":77,"tim":1490884841605,"time":1490884841,"md5":"5JFCQtio1cL3eQy6VfZJ2Q==","fsize":295988,"resto":118923319,"id":"3HPNVYoZ","country":"AU","m_img":1,"country_name":"Australia"},{"no":118927992,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)10:56:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118923319\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118923319<\/a><br>Shia LeCuck is now in Finland","time":1490885791,"resto":118923319,"id":"\/bUhGSBu","country":"ME","country_name":"Montenegro"},{"no":118928535,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)11:02:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Stop showing my son the harsh realities of life!

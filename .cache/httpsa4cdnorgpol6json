Eventually I told him I was going to shit post his account. He blocked me after I clearly won the argument. Later I go on his profile again and I refresh the page only to find he had deactivated his account. During this time (I had no idea at the time) he had informed all the inkling pedos that he had deactivated his account on his new account so that he could hide from me because he believed I had a large army of shitposters ready to fuck his account up. (I did not have a large army of shit posters at the time and I still don&#039;t but I do plan on gathering support for that so we can do large raids on the pedos) I then go to sleep and wake up the next day. By coincidence some pedo supporters parents find out about their teenagers splatoon child porn habits and force him to deactivate his account. The teen that had to deactivate his account is called the Yellowist. He had some splatoon child porn on his account but it was not as much as other accounts. He was a prominent member in the community and now he is gone. So two people vanished from the splatoon gmod community at once which obviously caused a mass panic. One by one BIG members in the community of pedos either announced that they were leaving splatoon or migrating to new platforms to post their cancer at or hiding on secret accounts because of the drama. This created even more panic among the pedos. After a while a lot of the pedos started pointing fingers towards me. One guy tried to mock me by posting disgusting pictures of things related to my image involving splatoon. Eventually I find out through mass multitasking that the person I had argued with the previous day had created a new account but I didn&#039;t know the name so in order to accomplish a future raid I had to find out this new account without any traces. After one hour I finally find the little faggot. After that a whole bunch of the pedos wanted to get me banned.","filename":"Anti Inkling Official Logo","ext":".jpg","w":1067,"h":1053,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":246,"tim":1493355347747,"time":1493355347,"md5":"9uhE+jkfvPkIkOqL2W1EWw==","fsize":183729,"resto":0,"id":"6WEPl4D5","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"i-trolled-a-shit-ton-of-pedos-today","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":123147113,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)00:32:00","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Why?","com":"Why is america alienating her neighbours?

Actually, it&#039;s not clear that all those on &quot;the right&quot; support anything universally! Take two of the aforementioned groups, the libertarians and the fascists.

Hayek&#039;s 1944 book, &quot;The Road to Serfdom&quot;, where he described Germany&#039;s slide from socialism to fascism and argued that a similar process could happen elsewhere. Hayek opposed socialism because he saw it as a stepping-stone towards fascism.

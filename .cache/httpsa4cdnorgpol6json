The new system will work for some time, until it ends up with the tyranny of the king, then a new system arises, and so goes the cycle of civilizations and states. What is forgotten in this discussion is the reality of race, ethnicity and even the evolution and devolution of the men in any particular state. What history has shown though, is giving the common man the best chance to enjoy the fruits of his own labour and freedom of speech has given rise to the Greek city states, the Roman Empire and Western Civilization.(this might now work in Sub-Sahara for example, but let&#039;s leave that aside) Western Civilization being the absolute pinnacle of any civilization ever, giving more prosperity and technological advancement ever seen.

You mention apples, which for now we can agree to understand and have the same definition for. We can even agree on what &quot;two apples&quot; means for the sake of argument.

Does it have meaning? And the sentence 2+2=4? It seems to capture a certain pattern that we continually witness. &quot;Two bananas plus two bananas equals four bananas.&quot; This seems to persist when we replace bananas with oranges, and so on. <br><br>The &quot;mathematical&quot; sentence is meant to be an abstraction of a pattern defined again via example, and is thus subject to the same potential for error as any other definition by example. As a mathematician I can tell you there is no magical definition here to save us, no appeal to a mystical math authority.

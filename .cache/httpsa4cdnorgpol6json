Which I will do. <br><br><br><a href=\"#p122251551\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122251551<\/a><br>Thanks for the advice anon, I haven&#039;t started front end yet, still unit testing. Im still into Angular after what the improvements I saw from 2 to 4 but if there&#039;s more stagnation i&#039;ll join the reactfags. <br><br>Primarily because vanilla javascript is more compatible with React (and therefore i can implement 3rd party applications easier like d3) rather than find the shittiest of shit thats available for Typescript and therefore Angular. However I do love Angular because it truly is all in one even though it hasn&#039;t been able to really compete with React&#039;s View competency for the last 2 years","time":1492847425,"resto":122241599,"id":"D04YlbvA","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122252710,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)03:56:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"ITT: a retard reverse engineers a wiki\/imageboard and wants people to dox themselves in order to get in his le ebin secrit club","filename":"r4290ark","ext":".jpg","w":370,"h":359,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":121,"tim":1492847803224,"time":1492847803,"md5":"e6o8CofOFjblKG8kLOxNeQ==","fsize":51337,"resto":122241599,"id":"AwjKa2cK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122252796,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)03:57:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122252343\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122252343<\/a><br>what is the purpose of this angular shit?","time":1492847878,"resto":122241599,"id":"42\/iWVJ2","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122253097,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)04:02:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122252343\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122252343<\/a><br><br>Angular 1 was really good &quot;back in the day&quot; but it&#039;s not really the best choice in 2017 and ng2+ is as needlessly overcomplicated as a german car.

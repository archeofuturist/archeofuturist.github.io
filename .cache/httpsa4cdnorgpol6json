He was transported to UMass Memorial Hospital-Leominster, where he was pronounced dead at 4:07 a.m.[10][92][93][11] State Department of Correction spokesman Christopher Fallon first said no suicide note was found in Hernandez&#039;s single-occupant cell, but on April 20, 2017, investigators reported that three handwritten notes were next to a Bible opened to John 3:16 and &quot;John 3:16&quot; was written on his forehead in ink.[94] One note said he was entering the &quot;timeless realm&quot; and would see his family in heaven while another note said he loved his family and told them not to shed a tear; soap was found covering the floor and there were drawings in blood on the walls showing an unfinished pyramid and the all-seeing eye of God with the word &quot;Illuminati&quot; written in capital letters underneath.[95] Prison officials had not observed any signs that Hernandez was at risk for suicide, so he was not put on around-the-clock watch.[96] Upon completion of the autopsy by the medical examiner, the death has been officially ruled a suicide. Hernandez&#039;s brain was released to Boston University to be studied for signs of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a progressive degenerative disease found in people who have had a severe blow or repeated blows to the head.[97] His lawyer-agent, Jose Baez, disputed any claim of suicide, initiating his own investigation of the death.[98]","filename":"image","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":667,"tn_w":187,"tn_h":249,"tim":1492996011008,"time":1492996011,"md5":"o7QH+rlsjEf0vDHYY\/vx3A==","fsize":76946,"resto":0,"id":"nIv4nKJw","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"illuminati-blood-pyramid","country_name":"United States","replies":26,"images":6,"omitted_posts":21,"omitted_images":4},{"no":122529609,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)22:34:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122523238\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122523238<\/a><br>No he&#039;s not lying. Killing is a thrill, just ask any hunter. They love to watch things die. Humans are predators by nature; this isn&#039;t hard to tell. However, the transition from hunting to agriculture forced a repression of our natural urge to kill...<br><br>How does this connect to child sacrifice and cults? The cult part is simple; it&#039;s theater. Some legitimately believe in the spiritual side of the cults, but most attend in order to witness the spectacle. You don&#039;t get to see that kind of stuff anywhere else, and #YOLO...<br><br>The child sacrifice is a little more complicated, and this is simply my theory\/opinion. Killing weak or sick things feels better than killing healthy things. I base this theory off of evolution. When a predator hunts, it doesn&#039;t even attempt to attack health prey. Instead, it chooses targets that are sickly or young...<br><br>Obviously this is to their advantage. The elderly or a calf is far less likely to hurt them then a full grown, healthy adult. However, what drives this instinct? Do they just do it without thought, or (and this is my theory) is their a pleasure response associated with killing weak things? What if prey selection had a biological response akin to sex? What if over the years predators evolved to &quot;orgasm&quot; (I use that term figuratively) from killing weak things... Having sex is good for the survival of the species; therefore, your body rewards your mind for it. Killing weak prey instead of healthy prey is good for your own survival; and therefore, the survival of your species. Again, it would make sense if your body rewarded you for &quot;killing kids.&quot;<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Yes, I know it&#039;s fucked up, and I don&#039;t like the idea either...

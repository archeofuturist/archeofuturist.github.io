The idea that there is a single truth--&#039;the Truth&#039;--is a construct of the Euro-West that is deeply rooted in the Enlightenment, which was a movement that also described Black and Brown people as both subhuman and impervious to pain. This construction is a myth and white supremacy, imperialism, colonization, capitalism, and the United States of America are all of its progeny. The idea that the truth is an entity for which we must search, in matters that endanger our abilities to exist in open spaces, is an attempt to silence oppressed peoples.<br><br>http:\/\/reason.com\/blog\/2017\/04\/17\/p<wbr>omona-college-students-say-theres-n<wbr>o-su","filename":"Frederick_Douglass_portrait","ext":".jpg","w":800,"h":1149,"tn_w":174,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492610132009,"time":1492610132,"md5":"9yLf4FBgqlA4Ps2mQhDT+Q==","fsize":144943,"resto":0,"id":"AvXTcPQZ","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"pomona-college-basketball-americans-say-theres-no","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":121840903,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)08:57:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"I want an educated (lol) communist to explain to me the answer to this question.<br>Assuming society has reached post-scarcity and virtually everything is communally owned, people still have to produce food.

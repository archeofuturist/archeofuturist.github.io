His 1928 bombshell Propaganda lays out his eerily prescient vision for using propaganda to regiment the collective mind in a variety of areas, including government, politics, art, science and education. To read this book today is to frightfully comprehend what our contemporary institutions of government and business have become in regards to organized manipulation of the masses.<\/span><br><br>https:\/\/www.voltairenet.org\/IMG\/pdf<wbr>\/Bernays_Propaganda_in_english_.pdf<wbr><br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Edwar<wbr>d_Bernays","filename":"1493187969092","ext":".jpg","w":1920,"h":1387,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":90,"tim":1493202898340,"time":1493202898,"md5":"9d0xMZ7\/jEJZRzXpXljU0A==","fsize":729448,"resto":122862292,"id":"Xzl4hLVL","country":"AU","m_img":1,"country_name":"Australia"},{"no":122869927,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)06:37:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"IMHO KeK has shown us the way.<br><br>Antifa leadership BAMN.

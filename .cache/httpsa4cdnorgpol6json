Israeli globalists build up the ethnocentric state for Israel while causing weakness in western politics with multiculturalism because Marxism makes it easier to push populations into a new world order (global government) under Israeli and dynastic central banker control.

ISIS is a convenient tool that Israeli globalists fund via the deep states they largely control. Terror gives them leverage to increase their government power and execute agendas, such as overthrowing governments resisting Israel and globalism. The end game is world domination of resources with a suppressed but superficially content slave class packed into green but highly vulnerable megacities. It&#039;s communism merged to corporatism, with people raised to detest commoners who seek representation, individual liberty, and family choices that contradict the central government&#039;s program.","time":1492771743,"resto":122113047,"id":"0wc0\/Zzk","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122123355,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)06:53:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122123038\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122123038<\/a><br>How can this not backfire though?<br><br>Muslims hate Jews.

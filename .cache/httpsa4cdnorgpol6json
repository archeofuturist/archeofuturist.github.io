Example: I go a week of eating healthy\/lifting. I gradually get stressed out about this throughout the week. On my weekend I allow myself the &quot;reward&quot; of gorging myself on pizza donuts and ice cream. Afterwards instead of feeling happier\/less stressed I actually feel let down and depressed.<br><br>If my goals are things like: go to college, get fit, effectively use my time, create art, then why are my dopaminergic reward systems not tied to those goals, and are instead associating that behavior with stress or anxiety? I TRULY want those things. I truly want to be that person. So why are my emotions not tied into those things the way you would expect? Does my brain require more time to rewire itself? I don&#039;t understand why my brain is associating the things I actually want in life with negativity. Does part of me not believe I can actually DO it, and therefore has a sort of phobia associated with positive behavior?","filename":"jordan peterson","ext":".jpg","w":300,"h":168,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1493872604317,"time":1493872604,"md5":"I0iS+q+p8+t5U9PxFNovnQ==","fsize":6353,"resto":0,"id":"yqWJZabi","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-last-few-weeks-since-i-started-watching","country_name":"United States","replies":147,"images":18,"omitted_posts":142,"omitted_images":18,"tail_size":50},{"no":124047482,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)06:38:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124019661\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124019661<\/a><br>if you don&#039;t like it go jerk off in a slide thread you dumb faggot","time":1493894328,"resto":124019134,"id":"fDU56+LV","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124047724,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)06:42:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124047261\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124047261<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;if I post this, I can prove to everybody in this thread that I&#039;m smarter than everybody in this thread!<\/span>","time":1493894536,"resto":124019134,"id":"3ULdlSHK","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":124047759,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)06:42:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124033638\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124033638<\/a><br>Join the orthodox church","time":1493894555,"resto":124019134,"id":"jve\/RQH9","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":124047999,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)06:45:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124047261\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124047261<\/a><br><br>I think you replied to the wrong thread.","time":1493894751,"resto":124019134,"id":"smTgKMBa","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":124048439,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)06:51:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124019134\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124019134<\/a><br>does peterson ever discuss (((fraud))), and his invention of spychology as a curse on the goyim?","time":1493895116,"resto":124019134,"id":"KKkEdcc+","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"}]},{"posts":[{"no":124048378,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)06:51:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"How would Basic Income work?

The answer to that question is noone. You might think the elites might use it to rid the earth of their enemies and reduce population, but even for them this way of doing it a) causes to many side effects and influence on nature and b) has too many variables, since you can&#039;t be sure who nukes where and you can&#039;t plan the outcome good enough to be able to stabilize a new society afterwards.<br><br>I mean look at the war zones we have today, war isn&#039;t what it used to be and the war in those countries is neverending. In a land where the infrastructure is destroyed, economics don&#039;t exist anymore and people lost all good belief there will be only chaos. This chaos would last for at least some decades and again the outcome would be very unstable and hard to plan for.<br><br>Second we have to ask ourselves why everyone keeps their bombs then. This one is simple and you heard it before: So no madman can push the button without killing himself. And there is a second answer: You can use nuclear weapons on a smaller scale for tactical combat. Small rounds with nuclear parts that wreck a lot of devastation will come, will be in use and will not influence nature too much. You can predict the outcome. This is very dangerous and unsettling, but won&#039;t lead to an all out nuclear war.<br><br>And there there is someting else people don&#039;t think about enough: Having an all out nuclear war only occurs when it is clear who shot first. All scenarios are like &quot;A attacks B who is partners with C, they shoot back but A is partners with D and will retaliate.&quot; and so on. Have you ever thought about that the &quot;new&quot; nuclear danger is not countries nuking it each other, but CovertOps looking like terrorist action? If you are Putin you could easily set up a CovertOps of Pseudo-Terrorists getting a quite small bomb into NY for example. You could blow up the city, and the US could not react.","filename":"1491895215258","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":720,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1493894903531,"time":1493894903,"md5":"pRjhfHES9WqEZXiEPeEJLg==","fsize":61326,"resto":0,"id":"jJcL5u9h","country":"DE","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"will-there-be-nuclear-war","country_name":"Germany","replies":3,"images":0},{"no":124048201,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)06:48:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"In this scenario you would be able to influence politics on a large scale. Just imagine a US where NY got nuked but noone knows where it came from. They only thing the US could do without being the madman who pushes random nuke button they would have to do the same as with 911: Attack countries they wanted to attack anyways with regular warfare. They would HAVE to do that since the public wouldn&#039;t be able to deal with the fact that you have no clue what to do. But again: This won&#039;t cause an all out nuclear war. It could lead to WW3, and possibly would shake every society on earth, but it won&#039;t end in nuclear holocaust.<br><br>So given all this, is nuclear holocaust even possible? Yes it is. But only if someone with much power and no regard for himself and the outcome is able to push the button without other people verifying it. Right now I&#039;m not aware of a country that a) HAS nukes b) is that radical and c) has a president with so much power that he can push the button alone, without his staff killing him before he can.<br><br>So my answer: Don&#039;t hope for it or be afraid, it just won&#039;t happen.

The strategy is a form of Nash equilibrium in which, once armed, neither side has any incentive to initiate a conflict or to disarm.<\/span><br><br>The whole idea behind this is that not only can two nuclear powers not nuke each other without themselves ceasing to exist, but this also implies that no major war of any kind can take place between those powers, since it would lead sooner or later to a nuclear war and again both countries would cease to exist. You can see the resulting behaviour in countries like Pakistan \/ India: They hate each other but they can&#039;t do shit. The only thing they do is bee stings, mutilating soldiers, stealing stuff and in general just being a pain in the ass for the opposing country. There will never be war between those two because it is impossible. Same goes for all nuclear powers on the planet.<br><br>In fact nuclear power become more moderate, not more aggressive.

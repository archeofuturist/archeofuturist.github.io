The people who join Antifa, for example, aren&#039;t interested in fascism per se \u2013 they&#039;re interested in being able to smash up cars with crowbars, in beating people senseless, and in setting shit on fire with Molotov cocktails. If a genie gave them the power to do all of that without social and psychological consequences, I think they would. Because they can&#039;t, they re-frame their behaviour as resistance to oppression, in an attempt to make it justifiable.<br><br>If you focus on the way these people actually act, and forget all about politics for a moment, almost everyone would agree that certain behaviours are wrong. When you look at SJWs on Tumblr, for example, they are not nice people. On principle, being a snarky cunt, aggressively insulting people over simple disagreements, and forming pressure groups to get people fired from their jobs would all be frowned upon by society. Generally speaking, you can&#039;t behave like this and get away with it, because it doesn&#039;t fly with anyone. However, when you say you&#039;re doing it to some bad guys who deserve it, you get a free pass. Suddenly, it becomes a lot more acceptable, and other people actually join in, because they&#039;ve been suppressing this behaviour for years and they now have an outlet for it that won&#039;t result in them being excommunicated from society.","filename":"Antifa","ext":".png","w":1280,"h":1280,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490535410132,"time":1490535410,"md5":"ETteMV+VkbNRY4XIMMSlMg==","fsize":285315,"resto":0,"id":"i84XXldx","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"anyone-else-here-feel-like-the-sjw-movement-and","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":9,"images":1,"omitted_posts":4,"omitted_images":0},{"no":118365455,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)10:15:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118365264\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118365264<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;ANTIFA IS DA REAL FASCISTS!!!<\/span><br><br>Good job letting the far-left define the political ground for you, jackass.","time":1490537739,"resto":118361996,"id":"OTB+CcZ1","country":"MX","country_name":"Mexico"},{"no":118365846,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)10:20:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"bump for more","time":1490538005,"resto":118361996,"id":"EmnPoq5s","country":"RO","country_name":"Romania"},{"no":118367422,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)10:37:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118361996\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118361996<\/a><br>That&#039;s how all human are, you can&#039;t really get rid of tribalism, people just ignored it and called it racism, fascism, and other isms","time":1490539063,"resto":118361996,"id":"WiG\/\/AKp","country":"IQ","country_name":"Iraq"},{"no":118367561,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)10:39:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118367422\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118367422<\/a><br>And of course you can&#039;t get rid of your cancer by ignoring it.","time":1490539151,"resto":118361996,"id":"WiG\/\/AKp","country":"IQ","country_name":"Iraq"},{"no":118367816,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)10:41:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118365002\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118365002<\/a><br>Yeah, we can&#039;t have people talking about serious things, right?

More than any other news agency, these guys are the fakest of the fake and they hate when people call them out for it. I have made it my own personal goal to search multiple search terms every day with things like &quot;cnn fake news&quot; &quot;anderson cooper fake news&quot; &quot;don lemon fake news&quot; Anderson cooper CIA agent&quot; &quot;cnn is fake news&quot; etc... if everyone starts doing this then i hope that when a normie just puts &quot;CNN&quot; in the search bar, then &quot;CNN FAKE NEWS&quot; will pop up below in the suggested results. Thats where i need your help \/Pol\/ i need as many people to do this every day, it will ony take about 2 mins max, and will result in Ultimate Lulz, once the plan works, we will have tucker carlson make a note of it on his show, and force cnn to adress the issue, thus red pilling even more normies.","filename":"CNN-fake-news","ext":".jpg","w":700,"h":400,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":142,"tim":1490798390195,"time":1490798390,"md5":"Oh5cXH4dh4FTgvY3DQihyw==","fsize":43403,"resto":0,"id":"jjEo8P8k","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"cnn-fake-news","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":118791409,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)10:34:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"ITT: Post your country&#039;s rightful clay","filename":"Greater Norway","ext":".png","w":4572,"h":2500,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":136,"tim":1490798051861,"time":1490798051,"md5":"nhgD84WNkdKYv5fMLZGruQ==","fsize":3321719,"resto":0,"id":"Cr6wkwGB","country":"NO","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"itt-post-your-countrys-rightful-clay","country_name":"Norway","replies":2,"images":2},{"no":118791475,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)10:34:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"Template","filename":"Political_Grey_Map_World","ext":".png","w":4572,"h":2500,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":68,"tim":1490798084980,"time":1490798084,"md5":"l5uG5kq+StLTnOXKt3QDiA==","fsize":3259670,"resto":118791409,"id":"Cr6wkwGB","country":"NO","m_img":1,"country_name":"Norway"},{"no":118791983,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)10:39:41","name":"Anonymous","filename":"d2160318e819bc422ee121ccdfb9181a","ext":".png","w":2615,"h":2030,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":97,"tim":1490798381518,"time":1490798381,"md5":"0hYDGOgZvEIu4SHM37kYGg==","fsize":253237,"resto":118791409,"id":"u6c7hAlI","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118791982,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)10:39:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA<br>AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA<br>AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA<br>AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA<br>AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA<br>AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA<br>AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA","filename":"1473450865059","ext":".jpg","w":575,"h":323,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1490798382609,"time":1490798382,"md5":"t4E3bTlIVD2lzURUIPkulg==","fsize":52377,"resto":0,"id":"iSkMLTSD","country":"IL","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"ahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha","country_name":"Israel","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":118791936,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)10:39:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"Convince me why Communism wouldn&#039;t work","filename":"Value_for_money","ext":".jpg","w":1104,"h":660,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":149,"tim":1490798353210,"time":1490798353,"md5":"Vx0\/gwUHP2fch6gmG91p\/Q==","fsize":183661,"resto":0,"id":"pL9zM67+","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"convince-me-why-communism-wouldnt-work","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":118790855,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)10:28:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"Red-pill me on India","filename":"mm","ext":".jpg","w":856,"h":1390,"tn_w":153,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490797703767,"time":1490797703,"md5":"TTBmspNWqHvRIRjFAtN91w==","fsize":177552,"resto":0,"id":"ZiwZCdrv","country":"IN","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"redpill-me-on-india","country_name":"India","replies":5,"images":1},{"no":118790969,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)10:29:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"You live there.

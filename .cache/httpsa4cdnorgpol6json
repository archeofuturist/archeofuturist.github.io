There&#039;s a lot of ways to subvert them.<br><br>1) Remember, their mods get extremely assmad if anyone disagrees with their opinions. So if you&#039;re going to troll \/leftypol\/ remember to use a VPN. Here&#039;s the one I use to evade bans:<br>http:\/\/www.cyberghostvpn.com\/en_us<br><br>2) If there&#039;s one thing \/leftypol\/ hates, it&#039;s identity politics. Try to bring it up as much as possible in as many ways as possible. You can trigger people by posting with the &quot;anarcho-feminist&quot; flag. The best way to D&amp;C is to bring up subjects like immigration, feminism, etc... etc...<br><br>3) The mods really hate national-bolsheviks and Strasserists. Mainly because they see them as a threat. The reason being that these particular ideologies are very worker oriented but are also redpilled when it comes to nationalism and immigration. It&#039;s also a good way drop subtle redpills over there. You can also post with the tankie flag for a similar effect.<br><br>4) Be sure to exploit the divide between Marxists and anarchists. They generally don&#039;t like each other too much. Explain the need for a state if you&#039;re posing as a Marxist and be sure to insult anarchists as much as possible. Do the inverse if you&#039;re posing as an anarchist.<br><br>5) and most of all.

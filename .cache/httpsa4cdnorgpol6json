Price is what you pay for a particular commodity. Price tends towards value, but it is not the same thing. Price is a numerical figure. Value on the other hand, is something relative to other commodities.<br>Example: the price of a can of coke varies. 60p, 90p, \u00a31.50, 120 Yen.<br>But it will almost always be less expensive than the price of a car - no matter how much that car is, \u00a3300 or \u00a330,000. <br>This is because the value of the car is greater than the value of the can of coke. <br>The value determines the \u201cprice range\u201d if you like. <br>Value is what we use to compare commodities. Commodities have proportional value to each other, and they will be sold at a price that tends towards their value. Individual instances of things having a price well above their real value bracket do not disprove this theory, as it attempts only to deal with general trends. So, the fact that a celebrity&#039;s tissue sells on eBay for hundreds of dollars, or something, can be treated as an anomaly. It is a price that doesn&#039;t tend towards value, for other explicable reasons. <br><br>So what gives things \u201cvalue\u201d? What makes the car more valuable than the can of coke? What makes a house more valuable than a spoon? What is value?<br><br>It must be the common factor amongst all commodities - it must be something that allows us to make this comparisson between commodities. How can I say that a table is worth twice as much as a chair, if there is no common feature about them?

It is labour. To produce a commodity a certain amount of labour must combined with it. The entire process of creating a commodity can be reduced to human labour time. By combining human labour with other commodities, capitalists can add value to the commodity (e.g. turning steel into a car). Human labour time has gone into every commoditty, at some stage. The more human labour time that has gone into producing a commodity, the more expensive it will be. <br><br>This human labour time is reduced down into everything; every machine, every transport, every drop of fuel - all at the root of them all is human labour, first and foremost. If the machine you use to produce your commodity took x human labour hours to invent, and y human labour hours to build, and continues to take z human labour hours to maintain - that is the value of that machine. The value (and again, note, I do not mean price) of all your costs as a capitalist are reducible to human labour time. <br><br>Most criticisms of LTV crucially fail to understand that it does not attempt to determine prices, only values. Again, when it says &quot;value&quot;, it means exchange value specifically - Marx always acknowledged the concept of &quot;use-value&quot; as well, but he argued that while perceived use-value might have some sway on price, in general price tends more towards exchange-value than use-value. He fully agrees that use-value is subjective, prone to change based on fashion and circumstance. It is for those exact reasons that he thinks it cannot be a sufficient determining factor in price. It must be exchange-value that provides the greatest mass of gravity around which price fluctuates. Price is of course a far more nebulus concept, that Marx never claimed to be able to determine so precisely. He only recognised that there was a general trend towards which prices gravitated, and that this was rooted in exchange-value, a.k.a socially necessary labour time value.","filename":"young marx","ext":".jpg","w":220,"h":407,"tn_w":67,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492432025917,"time":1492432025,"md5":"ROecyk\/++rvWF95CoO0+Sg==","fsize":28731,"resto":121519435,"id":"KgLKYIGm","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121519907,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)08:28:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121519435\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121519435<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121519523\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121519523<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121519739\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121519739<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Non-empirical nonsense<\/span><br>Making shit up to justify value being some fabricated number instead of what you can sell a product for doesn&#039;t make it true.

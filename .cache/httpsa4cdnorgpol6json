The last remaining election fog has lifted. Instead of an overworked statement about a joint fight against the biggest enemy, ISIS (the Islamic State), the Trump administration proved that it will fiercely fight the legitimate Syrian government, in a tough contradiction with international law and without UN approval, in violation of its own procedures stipulating that the Congress must first be notified of any military operation unrelated to aggression against the US.

This military action is a clear indication of the US President\u2019s extreme dependency on the opinion of the Washington establishment, the one that the new president strongly criticised in his inauguration speech.

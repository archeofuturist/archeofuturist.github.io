According to a stagist conception of progressive history (which is usually blind to its implicit teleology), the work of figures like Foucault, Derrida and other cutting-edge French theorists is often intuitively affiliated with a form of profound and sophisticated critique that presumably far surpasses anything found in the socialist, Marxist or anarchist traditions. It is certainly true and merits emphasis that the Anglophone reception of French theory, as John McCumber has aptly pointed out, had important political implications as a pole of resistance to the false political neutrality, the safe technicalities of logic and language, or the direct ideological conformism operative in the McCarthy-supported traditions of Anglo-American philosophy. <\/span><br><br>http:\/\/thephilosophicalsalon.com\/th<wbr>e-cia-reads-french-theory-on-the-in<wbr>tellectual-labor-of-dismantling-the<wbr>-cultural-left\/","filename":"1491025965322","ext":".jpg","w":719,"h":960,"tn_w":93,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492679833340,"time":1492679833,"md5":"tDS\/QMLj8xw5QXJV5GEV9A==","fsize":110579,"resto":121974031,"id":"hd5a6hYe","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":121975446,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)05:24:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121974031\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121974031<\/a><br>dont pretend like eurocuck colleges are any different, if anything its even worse here","time":1492680288,"resto":121974031,"id":"QmBhb6CT","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":121975958,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)05:31:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121975446\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121975446<\/a><br>not in greece<br>uni was the best time for me, graduated last year<br>we always shittalked albanians and muslims, it was hilarious<br>our professors weren&#039;t politically correct fags, they were educated christian conservatives","time":1492680687,"resto":121974031,"id":"qlpVC2Eu","country":"GR","country_name":"Greece"},{"no":121976177,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)05:34:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121975958\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121975958<\/a><br>im talking about western europe, your country is borderline","time":1492680864,"resto":121974031,"id":"QmBhb6CT","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"}]},{"posts":[{"no":121961827,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)02:11:27","name":"Anonymous","sub":"How Many People Here are Unhappy?","com":"How many people on \/pol\/ are generally unhappy and why?

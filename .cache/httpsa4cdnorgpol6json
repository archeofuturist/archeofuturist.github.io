His large portfolio of published political cartoons points to a man who knew how to harness the power of symbols and metaphor, but who had little by way of a coherent or consistent adult ideology to express. Sometimes he seems hateful, while at other time he seems uncritical or just confused. In one cartoon, Dr. Seuss defines racial harmony as the utilization of black labor for the war effort, while in another he depicts 25 offensively caricatured black men standing beneath a sign that reads TAKE HOME A HIGH-GRADE NIGGER FOR YOUR WOODPILE!<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Theodor Geisel was as sloppy in his personal affairs as he was with his politics. He began dating his second wife Audrey while he was still married to his first wife Helen. At that point in their marriage, Helen was partially paralyzed and terminally sick with cancer. More than cancer, however, she was sick with the knowledge of her husband&#039;s affair, and as a result committed suicide with a barbiturate overdose in 1967. In her suicide note, she wrote that Geisel could &quot;say [she] was overworked and overwrought&quot; so that his &quot;reputation with [his] friends and fans will not be harmed.&quot; (A family member called Helen&#039;s suicide &quot;her last and greatest gift to him.&quot;) Dr. Seuss&#039;s mistress, 18 years his junior, promptly divorced her husband, and the recent widower was remarried within the year. The newlyweds sent the two children from Audrey&#039;s previous marriage to boarding school. Of children, Dr. Seuss was known to say, &quot;You have &#039;em and I&#039;ll entertain &#039;em.&quot;<\/span><br><br>https:\/\/broadly.vice.com\/en_us\/arti<wbr>cle\/dr-seuss-was-a-philandering-big<wbr>ot","time":1490339969,"resto":118041532,"id":"4RPNAjQz","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118052782,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)02:39:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"Really fires the neurons up","filename":"IMG_4294","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":768,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1490337572030,"time":1490337572,"md5":"9pFFsi8C0Ny5TUIPE3tCGw==","fsize":175342,"resto":0,"id":"tKc5oddS","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"really-fires-the-neurons-up","country_name":"United States","replies":18,"images":3,"omitted_posts":13,"omitted_images":2},{"no":118055078,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)03:09:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"Hillary Clinton -&gt; George Soros -&gt; Adolph Hitler<br><br>there&#039;s a connection for you","time":1490339341,"resto":118052782,"id":"LFslcYRT","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118055412,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)03:14:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"guess what,<br>they might have even connections to other countries in the world.

I&#039;m a second-generation Punjabi-American and I hate how the party that wants to disarm me, censor my speech, over-tax me, defend the Antifa and BLM thugs that wish to do me harm, and flood my country (the greatest country on earth) with Muslims that do not share our values is also the party that claims to be looking out for me! This idea that the Democrats are the part of non-whites needs to die for the good of non-white Americans. First off it feeds into the idea that the left wants to flood the country with non-whites that will vote for them regardless of what happens so that they can have a dependable voting bloc that they can use to stay in power. If this continues then my family and many of my friends will be seen as nothing more than the tools of criminals that seek to rape our country. Secondly the left wishes to make non-whites (and Muslims especially) a protected class. This is how tolerance dies. This is not asking for equality, this is asking for supremacy over the white man and I don&#039;t want this. When the white man&#039;s only two options are submission or hatred can you really blame him for choosing hatred? We must do away with hate crime laws and affirmative action so that we can have real equality. The killings of Sikhs by white men in this country will not stop when some blue-haired leftist tells rednecks that racism is wrong; it will stop when we are respected as equals and this can only be done by us doing good work and enriching the lives of all Americans by contributing to the arts and sciences.","filename":"Sikh of Islamic Terrorism","ext":".jpg","w":654,"h":875,"tn_w":186,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491187535748,"time":1491187535,"md5":"oJqCQ5+Ss2whsEDbiAaPWA==","fsize":120267,"resto":0,"id":"vv9DPQu4","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"how-do-we-end-the-democrats-stranglehold-on","country_name":"United States","replies":11,"images":1,"omitted_posts":6,"omitted_images":1},{"no":119281253,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)22:49:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119281114\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119281114<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;It is an incredibly diverse county yet they hold all county-wide positions.<\/span><br>Yeah barely.

Any good Youtube-video on the JQ gets blocked in all of mainland Europe, and you know that swallowing the redpill isn\u2019t exactly pleasant; threads about how \/pol\/ ruined someones life (depression, alienation) are not uncommon.<br><br>Some people are redpilled to the point where they agree that Jews have an enormously disproportionate influence, but at the same time are so incredibly bluepilled that they don\u2019t see a problem with that. \u201cThey\u2019re just smart and hardworking\u201d they say naively, thinking Jews have maintained their powerful positions by virtuous means.<br><br>The reason for this naivety is that whites are seldom racially aware, while other races see everything through a racial lense. Blacks tend to be more vocal (and violent) about it, but the fact that \u201cJewish\u201d is still a distinct ethnicity, despite them living among Europeans for thousands of years, proves the point. They have an extreme preference for their own kind, so extreme that at its worst it causes the death of millions of people, and at its best they subvert a nation to hate itself.","filename":"Le+_482f0157c9772bb0fc6b55923695d3f0","ext":".png","w":274,"h":242,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":220,"tim":1491187363636,"time":1491187363,"md5":"e1sQ5gU2XQ7U68tKS4JDMQ==","fsize":17720,"resto":0,"id":"CFIO+uV+","country":"NO","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"gonna-deliver-this-essay-on-the-jews-to-college","country_name":"Norway","replies":11,"images":1,"omitted_posts":6,"omitted_images":1},{"no":119281287,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)22:50:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119280951\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119280951<\/a><br>I know man, but like I said, I&#039;m dropping out and go STEM.<br><br><a href=\"#p119280949\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119280949<\/a><br>Will try my best","time":1491187809,"resto":119280572,"id":"CFIO+uV+","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":119281597,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)22:53:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119281287\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119281287<\/a><br>but you&#039;ll only push them further to the left<br>you need to be more subtle and (((subversive)))","time":1491187996,"resto":119280572,"id":"\/fgAqD5i","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119281660,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)22:53:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"Isn&#039;t this illegal in your country?","time":1491188034,"resto":119280572,"id":"0MRNXpsW","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119281704,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)22:54:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119281597\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119281597<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;i.e. bomb the school<\/span>","filename":"1489543660853","ext":".png","w":400,"h":388,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":121,"tim":1491188057579,"time":1491188057,"md5":"eMrNw9hawRbMifm2KoK+MQ==","fsize":127868,"resto":119280572,"id":"EB\/Z2NOf","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119281844,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)22:55:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"Ok, so you&#039;ve pointed out a theory that has been there for 500+ years about all races, cultures, and religions?

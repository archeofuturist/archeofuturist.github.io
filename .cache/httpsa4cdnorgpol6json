I don&#039;t mean unsuccessful either, because plenty of successful people with good heads on their shoulders decide to take the biggest and most lopsided gamble of their lives like the lowliest micro-brained dumb ass. The thing is marriage itself in the U.S. as it is structured and the current pool of women available in the U.S. to marry, stacks the odds against you SO drastically that you HAVE to be slightly retarded to agree to it. You can be an amazing businessman. A master decision maker. Yet, when it comes to marriage &quot;teehee, i&#039;ll take a chance.&quot; The pussy has that much power over you, your perceptions are that damaged, and\/or you must crave external validation to some extent because even if the pussy has no power over you, even if you realize pussy is abundant and you can have kids without marriage and just take care of the mother and the child that way, you will still cave because your friends, family members etc. are feeding you bullshit and you feel peer pressured into signing a contract that you know damn well in your gut is stupid. The 99% of guys out there who are miserable in marriages and tell you &quot;don&#039;t get married&quot; aren&#039;t doing it because they&#039;re trying to maintain some elaborate conspiracy and deny you happiness. They&#039;re reflecting on the mistake they&#039;ve made and trying to tell others not to do the same thing.

Beyond the background which finally returns to the sources with the second world war, the trailer has attracted a lot of players. It is sufficient to see the number of likes on YouTube this year to understand that fans are happy to see the Nazi army as bad guys killed. The evening of April 26, 2017 was also an opportunity for developers to take the floor to explain the whole process of development, but also to present the players who have been chosen in the game. In 2013, Sledgehammer Games had chosen Kevin Spacey to play Jonathan Irons, the great Machiavellian villain; This year, the studio appealed to less well-known actors but that moviegoers will recognize without penalty.&quot;<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;There is indeed Josh Duhamel who will embody the Sergeant William Pierson, described by the actor as being a man who thinks of his mission before his men. An &quot;asshole&quot; in bulk but which play a major role in the single player campaign. Less known, Jonathan Tucker (Virgin Suicides, in the Valley of lah) takes on the role of the soldier Robert Zussman, while Jeffrey Pierce will play lieutenant Joseph Turner. On the German side, we can tell you that among the Nazi SS, we find Robert Knepper (T - Bag in Prison Break, Hitman, the transporter 3) which will have an important role in the game. Information that has not been communicated by Activision and Sledgehammer Games, but we still confirm for seeing him in artwork at our reveal in London on April 21.&quot;<\/span><br><br>Hyped!!!!!","filename":"IMG_0867","ext":".png","w":630,"h":945,"tn_w":166,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493396736719,"time":1493396736,"md5":"+a\/4Fjv1GqJLKEXWkeqXfA==","fsize":1149604,"resto":0,"id":"VOwQmXwV","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"robert-knepper-will-play-the-german-ss-officer-in","country_name":"United States","replies":3,"images":0},{"no":123212218,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)12:27:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Remember the 6 million goyim!<\/span><br><br>fuck off with your kike shit you fucking shill faggot","time":1493396829,"resto":123212037,"id":"mthFb3WO","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123212254,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)12:27:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"Who cares?","time":1493396847,"resto":123212037,"id":"lEgt7GeY","country":"JP","country_name":"Japan"},{"no":123212347,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)12:28:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123212254\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123212254<\/a><br>Perhaps this means will get to play on the German side","time":1493396903,"resto":123212037,"id":"VOwQmXwV","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":123196464,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)09:55:16","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Just gave cops my info like a beta","com":"I feel angry with myself.<br><br>I just got pulled over by police and they gave me the usual license check, breath test etc.<br><br>When my license address didnt match the address I gave them, they told me I need to have it fixed. <br><br>Then they whipped out an ipad and said &#039;we just need an updated photo for our system.&#039; I sat there like a beta while they snapped a pic of my face.

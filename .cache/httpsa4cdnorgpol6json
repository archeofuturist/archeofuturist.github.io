I found out that the Spaniards conquered and ruled the Philippines for over 330 years. We stole, abused and murdered.

So I got some of the leaders of the region together in the exact location where they became an independent nation over 100 years ago. So, as a Spaniard I asked for forgiveness for what we as a people have done to them in this historical place!!!

The last thing you want to do with this group is give them any sort of funds which they can trade\/spend on their own. they&#039;re basically adult children, and needs to be treated as such.<br><br>group 3 - in the past this group of people would be in asylums, now they&#039;re on the streets, because for whatever reason &quot;asylums&quot; are cruel I guess. well these people need 24\/7 care until their illness\/psych issues are controlled, then they need to be taught how to live like a normal person. This group is probably never going to be fully salvageable, but I suspect 30% or so with proper medication and consoling could live normal lives. Problem is the women in this group learned a long time ago how comparatively easy life is when selling their bodies, so it will be a serious challenge with the women (the men less so). <br><br>Overall there isn&#039;t any great solutions, there are some homeless people who can probably be helped. the addicts should probably be tossed in a forced labor camp until they die. The mentally ill probably should be tossed in asylums until they&#039;re able to integrate with normal society (if that ever happens).","time":1491922597,"resto":120595972,"id":"I7OfaZH8","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":120602180,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)10:13:27","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Norway","com":"Can \/pol\/ please make fun of Norway?<br>Shadilay.","filename":"aphex-pepe-men-s-t-shirt","ext":".jpg","w":800,"h":800,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491920007423,"time":1491920007,"md5":"iT2\/rGbDt25dZFHg1Fp3lw==","fsize":56084,"resto":0,"id":"vP0thX59","country":"NO","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"norway","country_name":"Norway","replies":20,"images":6,"omitted_posts":15,"omitted_images":6},{"no":120603875,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)10:28:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120603574\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120603574<\/a><br>Norwegian is perverted form of swedish.

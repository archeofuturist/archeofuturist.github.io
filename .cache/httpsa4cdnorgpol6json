Create a bunch of fake jobs, like the US and Japan, where people spin signs and press elevator buttons for a living<br>2. Give people money and free education, and let them pursue knowledge and jobs as a means of finding purpose and self-realization - rather than something necessary for survival<br>The second option frees up a lot of intellectual capital, which can bring the society forwards.

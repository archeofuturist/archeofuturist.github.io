It is and remains their most glaring difference from the culture as a whole.

Think of it thusly. Christianity has infiltrated all the former pagan strongholds of the world, and has been either fairy or exceedingly successful at finding converts. Among the jewish community, however, converts to Christianity are practically unheard of (barring economic or political pressure). Why is this? Shouldn&#039;t, all things equal, the percentage of Jews converted be as high, or in fact, higher then the general population of unbelievers, considered a shared scriptural tradition? Why not?

Women tend to be pretty useless, but begging for help isn&#039;t effective since it puts all the power in the corner of the person you&#039;re begging. It gives you much more power to say you deserve help, you can dictate the terms of the help you get this way and it&#039;s more compelling, but the problem is that that&#039;s almost always a lie - nobody really deserves shit. So self-entitlement exists to fix this problem: convince yourself that you deserve help so that it&#039;s more convincing when you say it to other people.<br><br>When you remember that women are almost completely useless, it becomes a lot easier to figure out why they act the way they do.","time":1492499796,"resto":121644799,"id":"YRO7k1NW","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121653564,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)03:17:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121644799\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121644799<\/a><br>I&#039;m the flesh beast on the right.","time":1492499837,"resto":121644799,"id":"R9n3YAek","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121653695,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)03:19:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"On the side of this madman right here","filename":"DEUSVULTSHARK","ext":".png","w":349,"h":289,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":103,"tim":1492499941040,"time":1492499941,"md5":"6N1Lg+phww9cn7yRIKrSSg==","fsize":217589,"resto":121644799,"id":"ZIEc92ZY","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121653993,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)03:23:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121644799\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121644799<\/a><br>Best I got.

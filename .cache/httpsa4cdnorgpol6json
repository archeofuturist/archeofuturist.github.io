According to him the highschool is composed of 80% muslims. 80%!!!!! SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA 80% MUSLIM. This was my old high school too. I couldn&#039;t believe it. Then I looked it up myself. ECVHS received over 800 syrian refugee studentss and more is incoming. According to him hardly any of them are bothering to learn english and most of them treat other&#039;s like dog shit. In other words, El Cajon, CA is literally belonging to the muslim community now. I believe him now. A lot of the older muslims were humble as fuck but any 20 and younger are seriously fucked up.

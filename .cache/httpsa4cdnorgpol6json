Even if the relationship is ultimately harmful to us, we&#039;ll remain out of a sense of loyalty. The &quot;men are players\/cheaters&quot; meme is way overblown and they are a small fraction of a percentage of men. What happens is those men date\/fool around with A LOT of women so 1 chad could give 20+ women the impression that all men are horndog cheaters. And the kind of woman that can pull a chad, keep pulling chads so they date from that small pool over and over again and get burned each time, ignoring the vast majority of upper-average, average, lower-average, and poor tier men. <br><br>Women on the other hand only are in relationships if they are gaining something. Social status by having a highly desirable attractive male as a boyfriend, money\/house\/good health insurance\/resources from wealthy men, A sense of moral superiority when they date and try to &quot;fix&quot; a irresponsible loser druggie (that just happens to have &quot;abs&quot; from being emaciated). However as soon as a man shows weakness or that he is unable to provide something of value to the woman (tangible or non-tangible) She leaves FAST! Not only that, but loyalty is completely alien to them and convincing a woman in a relationship to cheat is like trying to convince a dog to eat table scraps. For some reason they seem to think that a cylindrical meat stick feels SO much better if it is owned someone who they barely know. Because her boyfriends nearly identical cylindrical meat stick is &quot;boring&quot;<br><br>I had a friend who was in a relationship for over a year with this one girl. They often talked about marriage, kids, having a home together. One day his appendix needed to be removed and he went to the hospital to get it removed. Simple procedure and the recovery was only 2 weeks or so after the surgery of basically just taking it easy. <br><br>But that was all it took.

You can think of it like as as a similar concept to Amish communities. The overall structure of government will follow some of Curtis Yarvin&#039;s ideas, and is shown below:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;1) We will create a cryptocurrency known as the Kekcoin. This Kekcoin will have the same amount of value as square meters of land owned (Read: 1 square meter of land = 1 Kekcoin). The idea stems from the German Rentenmark. This way, our currency will be the very first one which is backed by actual goods: land.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;2) People who are eligible to live in the MPoK will have to buy those coins, go to the location, and claim a piece of land in relation to how many Kekcoins he spends.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;3) Not everybody will be eligible to live there, but even if you are not eligible, you can invest in the MPoK. In addition, you will be free to speculate with our crypto in an exchange. <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;4) How to introduce the crypto is yet to be discussed.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;5) We have found land as cheap as 10710.41 hectares for $5,900,000 USD. This means that our cryptocurrency will issue the exact amount of 107,104,100 coins.

The FBI aren&#039;t in the business of beginning potentially president toppling investigations based on &#039;fake information&#039;.<br><br>- As for the Cabinet and the Supreme Court picks, well, the US Senate only needs a simple majority of 51 votes before candidates reach the executive branch ethics panel. Considering the Republicans currently have 52 seats in the senate, blaming this on Democrats is null and void.<br><br>- Budget. You can Google the outline of Trump&#039;s budget right now. The military wins big, of course to cover that $50B hole, you have to start cutting LOTS of services. The EPA is losing close to 28% of its funding, which is odd considering it only accounts for 0.01% of the US budget. You probably heard the uproar around Meals on Wheels too.<br><br>- Mexico, lol, Trump&#039;s idea to increase import taxes was floated a while ago....and shot down. What&#039;s the point of business&#039; using cross border labor if it suddenly becomes as expensive as locally sourced products? The business community will flip out. It won&#039;t happen. Ever. That leaves YOU paying for it one way or another. Trump has already floated the idea in his new budget.<br><br>- Obamacare? The Republicans have had 7 years to create an alternative, and instead they simply used one that Paul Ryan had laying around. Ryancare has been around in one form or another for years. The lack of an alternative shows that for the last 8 years the Republican&#039;s have had their finger up their arse doing sweet FA.<br><br>- And Trump supporters, the budget is going to hit them the hardest. This is a &#039;rust belt&#039; rebellion remember? The services being cut are being utilized mostly in Pro-Trump states.

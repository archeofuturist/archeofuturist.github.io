I want to get our best and brightest and make some quality videos so we don&#039;t get dismissed as some hackjob conspiritards.<br>Along with the video series, on the site we will have a list of red pilled reading material, documentaries, including The Greatest Story Never Told, and maybe a whole section dedication to pointing out media propaganda\/lies. We will have a forum on the website but it will require an account access, and to become a member of the site we will vet each request. We can have sub forums for each country that wants to take part, as well as a general.<br><br>Step 2. Create a pamphlet. On the pamphlet we will have lots of leading questions and semi-provocative statements and statistics regarding some of the topics I previously mentioned, that a lot of white people are already thinking. The things written on the pamphlet can&#039;t be bad enough that lefties would cry racism or want to bring it to the news, but just enough to get people thinking and wanting to know more. Pamphlets will be tailored to each country that wants to take part. On the pamphlets will be a link to our website. These pamphlets will only be delivered on foot to houses in all white towns\/neighbourhoods. Since a large majority of \/pol\/ lives in such areas, this won&#039;t be a difficult task. I believe these pamphlets should be hand delivered because it will have a bigger impact on people who read it, and they will take the information more seriously.

What a hope! In 1793, Pitt was thirty-four years old. Churchill unfortunately is an old man, capable, and only just capable at that, of carrying out the orders of that madman, Roosevelt.<br><br>In any case, the situations are in no way comparable. Take your mind back for a moment to the conditions in Pitt&#039;s time. From England&#039;s point of view, he was perfectly right in refusing to have any truck with Napoleon. By maintaining, as he did, a firm attitude under impossible conditions, he was safeguarding for his country such chance as it had of playing the role which subsequently fell to its lot in the nineteenth century. It was a policy designed to preserve the existence of his country. Churchill, by refusing to come to terms with me, has condemned his country to a policy of suicide.<br>...<br>At the beginning of this war I did my utmost to act as though I believed Churchill to be capable of grasping the truth of this great policy; and in his lucid moments he was indeed, capable of grasping it. But for a long time now he has been bound hand and foot to the Jewish-chariot. My object in trying to come to terms with England was to avoid creating an irreparable situation in the West. Later, when I attacked eastwards and lanced the communist abscess, I hoped thereby to rekindle a spark of common sense in the minds of the Western Powers. I gave them the chance, without lifting a finger, of making a contribution to an act of catharsis, in which they could have safely left the task of disinfecting the West in our hands alone. But the hatred felt by these hypocrites for a man of good faith is stronger than their sense of self preservation.&quot; - Adolf Hitler, Political Testament, Feb 4th, 1945","time":1492914329,"resto":122343065,"id":"hIdxx\/ZB","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122365410,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)22:26:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122346183\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122346183<\/a><br>You literally ruined my day thinking you had a point there.

Without further ado, here is the abstract.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Because women\u2019s studies radically challenges social hierarchies and lacks a unified identity and canon of thought, it often negotiates a precarious position within the modern corporatized university. At the same time, women\u2019s studies offers\u2014by virtue of its interdisciplinary, critical, and \u201cinfectious\u201d structure\u2014cutting-edge perspectives and goals that set it apart from more traditional fields. This paper theorizes that one future pedagogical priority of women\u2019s studies is to train students not only to master a body of knowledge but also to serve as symbolic \u201cviruses\u201d that infect, unsettle, and disrupt traditional and entrenched fields. In this essay, we first posit how the metaphor of the virus in part exemplifies an ideal feminist pedagogy, and we then investigate how both women\u2019s studies and the spread of actual viruses (e.g., Ebola, HIV) produce similar kinds of emotional responses in others.<\/span><br><br>link: http:\/\/hipatiapress.com\/hpjournals\/<wbr>index.php\/generos\/article\/viewFile\/<wbr>1983\/1624#page=78","filename":"how to read a book","ext":".jpg","w":200,"h":310,"tn_w":161,"tn_h":249,"tim":1490353913541,"time":1490353913,"md5":"SLhITUBgGLH\/A8II4FNSgw==","fsize":20155,"resto":0,"id":"yAqxPYcA","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"pol-reads-something-feminist-parasites-edition","country_name":"Canada","replies":19,"images":0,"omitted_posts":14,"omitted_images":0},{"no":118072369,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)07:44:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118071945\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118071945<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;When compared to the emotional impact of viruses\u2014particularly the sorts of panics viruses create\u2014women\u2019s studies and feminism also tend to produce similar emotional responses both within and outside of the corporate university (Zucker, 2004).

These movements seek to essentially reaffirm the need for the patriarchal status quo, devalue the critical capacities of women\u2019s studies programs, and re-appropriate the rhetoric of \u201cliberation\u201d for the conservative Far Right (Clark, Garner, Higonnet, &amp; Katrak, 2014). Collectively, these institutional and popular responses represent the corporate university\u2019s immune responses to the imposition of the feminist virus. Anti-feminist, postfeminist, and men\u2019s rights organizations represent, metaphorically, the protective t-cells and cytokines that seek out and dismantle threatening critical\/pedagogical invaders.<\/span><br><br>I&#039;m not entirely sure that these &quot;immune&quot; response are actually appropriate, sine they operate on the mode of believing that the people they&#039;re talking to, the feminists, are somehow there to debate. As the article makes clear, they are not there to have a conversation or a discussion about truth but rather to infect an institutions, which is not something for which truth is necessary. Rather, libels, intimidation, manipulation and non discursive means are what we should expect. As long as they can contaminate an institution, insert themselves into it and bend it to their will, there&#039;s no reason to suppose that truth should do anything to them.","time":1490356293,"resto":118070243,"id":"yAqxPYcA","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118073042,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)07:54:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118072621\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118072621<\/a><br>It&#039;s basically making explicit something we&#039;ve all known for a while.<br><br>Feminism, by its very nature, cannot do otherwise than be parasitical.

Everyone was kind of in the same zone of &quot;I don&#039;t know what I want to do in life, I want to be progressive and to fit in with others&quot; and was super PC, kowtowed to &quot;biological sex is a social construct&quot; etc and I recognized that I was denying reality and that we would all be content being mothers in a different time and place, so I started to resent feminism and progressivism, and I guess I took a wrong turn and ended up here<br><br>Oh also it&#039;s worth noting that while my parents are uber liberal, my mom was a SAHM because she&#039;s pragmatic and it made the most sense, and I always saw that kids from a home like mine performed better and were happier, regardless of what people said.

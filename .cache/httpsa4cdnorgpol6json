Survival. It is by far the most important aspect of life. Staying alive. It is chiseled in our brains as the instinct of survival. Even before self-awareness came into play, it was this very instinct that drove us to keep searching for food, water and shelter. But when you are evolved enough to think about your life, you start to think about your ultimate death as well. That&#039;s when it might get a little complicated, because how can you cope with non-existance when your brain was wired to keep you alive? It is unthinkable. Unacceptable... For your lizard brain anyway. What to do? Then, centuries later, an idea comes. The idea that you can survive your own death. That death is only the gateway to another world, another life, another chance of just BEING, just staying alive. It maybe wishful thinking but you don&#039;t care because now, you have hope. Hope derived from that unshakeable feeling, this illogical certainty that you will survive your own death... Why does it fell good? Because then, your lizard brain is satisfied. Your survival instinct has done it&#039;s job. When you face death it will hang on to any thought of being able to stay alive. &quot;There are no atheists in foxholes&quot;. It is very true. In times of danger(such as war) your survival instinct dictates your thoughts. Even if it contradicts everything you stand for. Believing in the afterlife in these situations seems to make sense because it HAS to make sense. Your brain NEEDS it to be true in order to cope with anything else happening. It&#039;s the strongest need we have. It will drive you to do and think stuff you never thought was moral. Just to keep you alive or to maintain the illusion that you just might get through this.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;TL;DR<\/span><br>Most basic instinct=Survival<br>Religion says: you can survive your own death<br>Your lizard brain (as in instincts)= Sing me up!

Pretty much all of the Christian sources I&#039;ve listened to over the years are of the Meek and Mild ChristCuck variety as that&#039;s what seems to be insanely popular in America right now. However, that&#039;s such a disservice as we know that virtues such as Honesty, Morality, Loyalty, Respect, and Family are fundamental pillars to NatSoc and Christianity heavily emphasizes such teachings but is often glossed over for more feminine, &quot;safe&quot; teachings in order to appeal to larger audiences.<br><br>I&#039;m tired of the Cucks that unemotionally beat around the bush, clergy that are clearly extorting their crowd for profit and care only for numbers, and pastors that try to sound profound pulling messages and sermons out of passages just because. All of the required reading and prominent traditional Alt-Right material has been fine up until this point and probably still will be for some time, but I wonder if there&#039;s anyone, or even an entire church, that fills this specific nich\u00e9 yet?

The concept of humanity excludes the concept of the enemy, because the enemy does not cease to be a human being-and hence there is no specific differentiation in that concept. That wars are waged in the name of humanity is not a contradiction of this simple truth; quite the contrary, it has an especially intensive political meaning. When a state fights its political enemy in the name of humanity, it is not a war for the sake of humanity, but a war wherein a particular state seeks to usurp a universal concept against its military opponent. At the expense of its opponent, it tries to identify itself with humanity in the same way as one can misuse peace, justice, progress, and civilization in order to claim these as one&#039;s own and to deny the same to the enemy.&quot;<br><br>&quot;The concept of humanity is an especially useful ideological instrument of imperialist expansion, and in its ethical-humanitarian form it is a specific vehicle of economic imperialism. Here one is reminded of a somewhat modified expression of Proudhon&#039;s: whoever invokes humanity wants to cheat. To confiscate the word humanity, to invoke and monopolize such a term probably has certain incalculable effects, such as denying the enemy the quality of being human and declaring him to be an outlaw of humanity; and a war can thereby be driven to the most extreme inhumanity.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Humanity according to natural law and liberal-individualistic doctrines is a universal, i.e., all-embracing, social ideal, a system of relations between individuals. This materializes only when the real possibility of war is precluded and every friend and enemy grouping becomes impossible.

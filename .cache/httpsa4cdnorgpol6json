Unlike older political thinkers, they entertained no hopes of suppressing factions and educating a united or homogeneous citizenry. Instead they constructed an elaborate machinery to contain factions in such a way that they would cancel one another and allow for the pursuit of the common good. The good is still the guiding consideration in their thought, although it is arrived at, less directly than in classical political thought, by tolerating faction. The Founders wished to achieve a national majority concerning the fundamental rights and then prevent that majority from using its power to overturn those fundamental rights.<br>In twentieth-century social science, however, the common good disappears and along with it the negative view of minorities. The very idea of majority\u2014now understood to be selfish interest\u2014is done away with in<br>order to protect the minorities. This breaks the delicate balance between majority and minority in Constitutional thought. In such a perspective, where there is no common good, minorities are no longer problematic, and the protection of them emerges as the central function of government.&quot;<br><br>- Alan Bloom &quot;The Closing of the American Mind&quot;","filename":"Hera","ext":".jpg","w":250,"h":365,"tn_w":85,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493115888686,"time":1493115888,"md5":"vHglywHUdxcled+a6hOQ\/A==","fsize":20440,"resto":122718213,"id":"d6Iww1VE","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122720745,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)06:38:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"Excellent thread","filename":"st philaret","ext":".jpg","w":776,"h":864,"tn_w":112,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493116685659,"time":1493116685,"md5":"3hHiLuKOtDJV2rd8p3zQtg==","fsize":77679,"resto":122718213,"id":"JYaoRgi6","country":"PT","country_name":"Portugal"}]},{"posts":[{"no":122699829,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)01:49:07","name":"Anonymous","sub":"WikiLeaks Emails Reveal Hillary Clinton Engaging In Holocaust Denial","com":"We made a huge mistake.<br><br>https:\/\/twitter.com\/wikileaks\/statu<wbr>s\/856614588921589760","filename":"Screenshot-93","ext":".jpg","w":591,"h":252,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":106,"tim":1493099347566,"time":1493099347,"md5":"TZQiyGdAWGDuQlLQaZ\/\/Bw==","fsize":57005,"resto":0,"id":"dIK5obCe","country":"AU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"wikileaks-emails-reveal-hillary-clinton-engaging","country_name":"Australia","replies":104,"images":14,"omitted_posts":99,"omitted_images":13,"tail_size":50},{"no":122719849,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)06:25:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122701426\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122701426<\/a><br>god damn , how can whites fall sooo low . no backbone no nothing .","time":1493115903,"resto":122699829,"id":"9qqwo+Aa","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":122719979,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)06:27:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122705619\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122705619<\/a>","filename":"the 2 party system","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":468,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":97,"tim":1493116027100,"time":1493116027,"md5":"hurVHJR43uacdEca6A0qHQ==","fsize":97243,"resto":122699829,"id":"6FPl+\/5d","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122720127,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)06:29:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122699829\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122699829<\/a><br><a href=\"#p122700281\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122700281<\/a><br><a href=\"#p122700806\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122700806<\/a><br>Allah, Dems have about 30 Jews in Congress.

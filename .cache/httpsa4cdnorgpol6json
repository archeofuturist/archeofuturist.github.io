He instituted widespread Marxist reforms throughout the country with the intention, essentially, of creating a non-revolutionary Socialist State.<br><br>Problems began to arise immediately because, as we know, Marxist-Leninist economics are creationist-tier retarded. The crux of the problem was the Nationalization of copper mines and the attempt to confiscate and redistribute farmland from landowners to worker co-ops. The net result of this was that the copper industry collapsed, and armed bands began roving the country murdering farmers and squatting on their land, trying to farm it with their political science degrees.<br><br>Soon people began to go hungry, and inflation regularly reached 150%. Miners organized to protest against Allende&#039;s reforms (which were ostensibly for their benefit) because they could not work anymore in the new Nationalized mines, which were ineptly run by ideologues. State police and political troops began opening fire on these protests. People started to die.<br><br>This would all sound very familiar to you if you were aware of the history of the Ukraine in the 1920s, the next step would be that the kulaks would be rounded up and executed or deported, to try and combat the inefficiency--this would fail, of course, and mass starvation would take effect.<br><br>Before this could happen, Pinochet launched his coup in September 11th. Allende put a gun in his mouth and blew his brains out, and Pinochet seized control.<br><br>So this is the country that Pinochet inherited. Rife with Leftist criminal gangs, many farmers dead or displaced, the copper industry destroyed, many people dead, worthless currency, and no political capital except that which came out of the barrel of a gun.","time":1491270520,"resto":119382090,"id":"roeK\/r5F","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119414444,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)21:55:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119413676\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119413676<\/a><br>Pinochet was in a terrible position and his only ally was the CIA and the American &quot;Chicago Boys&quot; who advocated that he rapidly implement free market economics to prevent the situation from getting worse. Nevertheless the damage had largely been done already, opening the markets does not bring dead farmers back to life, and nobody wants to move to a country to farm where there has just been a Socialist government tacitly pardoning the murder of farmers.<br><br>The economic continued a downward trend for a time, but people were no longer starving with Pinochet in control, and the mines were reopened. The farms were returned to their owners where possible and some semblance of normalcy returned--but remember, there are still gangs of guerillas and those Leftist bandits I mentioned earlier prowling around the country, hoping to be allowed to steal more than they already had, this time in the name of revolution.<br><br>Pinochet hunted down and exterminated them in an extremely brutal fashion. He had been tipped over the edge when one of his female relatives had called him to talk about her fears of her children starving. His men tore the guerillas and Leftists root and stem out of the country and, to be frank, tortured them to death before disposing of the bodies by throwing them into the ocean.<br><br>Things were bad under Pinochet, but he prevented an economic disaster of Holodomoresque proportions by doing what he did. When we say &quot;Pinochet did nothing wrong,&quot; we are being literal. He did not transform Chile into a paradise, but he prevented its descent into hellfire. The fact that the economy had already been destroyed when he took power is why things were not good under his rule, and it is true that not all of his reforms were ideal, but Allende was an imbecile and an ideologue and would have continued his insane operation to disaster unless he was stopped. Pinochet was the only man in a position to stop him. Parliament had even asked him to step down and he had refused.","time":1491270909,"resto":119382090,"id":"roeK\/r5F","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":119414168,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)21:52:49","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Not Happening","com":"Where were you when once again the doomsday happenings predicted to go down today never panned out.","filename":"itsnothappening","ext":".png","w":610,"h":403,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":165,"tim":1491270769986,"time":1491270769,"md5":"EteLIHnAnzn8dKIXzPuQkg==","fsize":221604,"resto":0,"id":"h4I8gPkx","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"not-happening","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":0},{"no":119414438,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)21:55:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119414168\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119414168<\/a><br>In my bunker.

Some still masturbate but others don&#039;t.<br><br>Personally I cannot think of a time that I&#039;ve ever had a conscious desire to want to have sex with anyone. There are a few things that can give me an erection but it&#039;s not physical appearance. I grew up in a religious family where both sex and nudity were taboo, and I got told off when I was around 12 for looking up pictures of naked people (I wanted to know what body parts looked like, it wasn&#039;t porn sites). Because of that (among other things) I think in my situation I&#039;ve just got some fucked up repression shit, but I don&#039;t believe that&#039;s the case for everyone who identifies as asexual. If therapy wasn&#039;t so expensive I&#039;d do that to try and sort myself out.<br><br>Pic related is an abstract representation of how asexuality is defined. &quot;true&quot; asexuality is the absolute 0,0, and the quadrant labelled &quot;asexuals&quot; is really the grey area where people have little to no sexual desire, or not enough to want to act on it.

I definitely believe there are people who use it as a label as some kind of security blanket - They feel they&#039;re broken and don&#039;t fit in with their sexually driven friends, but then when they find the label they&#039;re happy with who they are. This is actually pretty dangerous because it means there are people using the &quot;asexual&quot; label as a placebo to feel happy about their current state instead of addressing the deeper issues that could be causing those feelings.","time":1491270859,"resto":119396756,"id":"7n7u\/+40","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"}]},{"posts":[{"no":119413423,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)21:46:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"We need a totalitarian state to clean the mess we&#039;re into.","filename":"ThirdReichFlag","ext":".jpg","w":540,"h":365,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":168,"tim":1491270380238,"time":1491270380,"md5":"yTELxoxljnCNBje47wdguQ==","fsize":26844,"resto":0,"id":"CRa4hMDs","country":"GR","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"we-need-a-totalitarian-state-to-clean-the-mess","country_name":"Greece","replies":8,"images":1,"omitted_posts":3,"omitted_images":0},{"no":119413738,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)21:49:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119413633\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119413633<\/a><br>no I ain&#039;t talking about the degenerates , they&#039;re just assholes.<br>I&#039;m talking about all the criminal filth that has infested my country.","time":1491270555,"resto":119413423,"id":"CRa4hMDs","country":"GR","country_name":"Greece"},{"no":119413799,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)21:49:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119413423\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119413423<\/a><br>You&#039;re not white buddy.","time":1491270589,"resto":119413423,"id":"ftLuh1ES","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119413965,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)21:51:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119413738\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119413738<\/a><br>I don&#039;t think you know who you are up against.

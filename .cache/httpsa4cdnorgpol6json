I can&#039;t say I&#039;m the only Western Civilised man who finds it hard to take pride in his own Western Civilisation after having years of constant and needless attacks defaming my Western Civilisation from insecure non-westies here. Why not bully Niggers or Muslims ? Do they not have much more to be ashamed of than our Western Civilisation? Japs get bullied less than us and yet we are the purest Western Civilisation in all the World.<br><br>Like when its not just banter, when a meme is repeated over and over again, repeated systematically, it eventually becomes a truth irregardless of the intentions in repeating it. And that isn&#039;t just jokes any more then, then its harmful !<br>Would you call an Western Civilian an &quot;Inferior Being&quot; to his face? Would you say to a kind, peaceful and hard working salt of the earth Britbong that they are a &quot;The Remnants Of A Once Great People &quot;? Like it&#039;s a thing.

Despite having a large portion of their artillery positions destroyed, NK will successfully fuck Seoul up. South Korea and the U.S defend against a massive assault across the NK\/SK border. China refuses to help North Korea as they lend their air forces to the U.S and their allies but that is all they are willing to do at this point. NK is losing ground at this point so they try to hold off the invasion by deploying their nuclear weapons on the battlefield. After a couple of weeks or months the U.S and it&#039;s allies make it to Pyongyang while china takes the rest of the land unclaimed by the allies. The war lasts a couple of months but their will still be resistance.","filename":"whatever-trump-said-to-china-about-north-korea-it-seems-like-it-worked","ext":".jpg","w":400,"h":300,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1492190382879,"time":1492190382,"md5":"saveZ6QYFjyIu7KtXbnoIw==","fsize":23650,"resto":0,"id":"VgsIQOHl","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"korean-war-20-scenario","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":0},{"no":121087644,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)13:37:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"Ok","time":1492191424,"resto":121085660,"id":"Q5ia6+6Z","country":"EE","country_name":"Estonia"},{"no":121088292,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)13:42:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121085660\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121085660<\/a><br>gr8 story m8","time":1492191722,"resto":121085660,"id":"idv\/BVSi","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"}]},{"posts":[{"no":121085470,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)13:18:09","name":"NAKAM","sub":"death to the nazis","com":"all nazis deserve to die. not only those who committed atrocities during wwii, but also those who carry the nazi ideology into the 21st century.<br><br>every members of the alt-right white nationalists neonazi movement and the white supremacist terrorist group known as the klan should be hunted down and eliminated along with their f\u00fchrer","filename":"killin_nazis","ext":".gif","w":500,"h":205,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":102,"tim":1492190289677,"time":1492190289,"md5":"flLZkTEI\/wI\/PQsRV4ux+w==","fsize":1015694,"resto":0,"id":"EP1Asyv4","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"death-to-the-nazis","country_name":"United States","replies":18,"images":2,"omitted_posts":13,"omitted_images":2},{"no":121087460,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)13:35:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121085980\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121085980<\/a><br>this","time":1492191332,"resto":121085470,"id":"aXLaNntU","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121087560,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)13:36:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121085470\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121085470<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;killing nazis<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;spends the movie killing regular german soldiers instead<\/span><br>rly makes me think","time":1492191385,"resto":121085470,"id":"lgNRAibL","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":121087718,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)13:37:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121085470\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121085470<\/a><br><br>If you&#039;re anything but German there&#039;s a good chance your Grandfather spent a good part of their young life killing Nazis. <br><br>It&#039;s in your blood.","filename":"winters2","ext":".jpg","w":490,"h":323,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":82,"tim":1492191457858,"time":1492191457,"md5":"zPTuDfAZevu6lCTWWtptDg==","fsize":34436,"resto":121085470,"id":"6CZ6wb3k","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121088153,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)13:41:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121085597\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121085597<\/a><br>When exactly did killing nazis stop being patriotic?","time":1492191660,"resto":121085470,"id":"YuvddIec","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121088291,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)13:42:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121087718\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121087718<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;tfw great grandfather was an SS officer<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;tfw grandpa was Hitler youth<\/span><br><br>Feels good man","time":1492191722,"resto":121085470,"id":"OsAk2uAn","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":121088280,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)13:41:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;The main rule of a liberal society: a criminal has more rights than the victim of a crime or an average worker\/productive member of society<\/span><br>Prove it wrong.

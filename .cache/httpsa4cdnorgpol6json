For example, you will always see some church minister giving food to the homeless. But for the atheists, that&#039;s hard, they have to think about, they have to raise funds, the don&#039;t have that moral intuition. They are amateurs.<br>But religion isn&#039;t just about morality. It is also about mob mentality, social control, and lots of bullshit and institutionalized bigotry.<br>And, by the way, it&#039;s rather good that we don&#039;t follow old Christian moral rules to the letter. I mean, have you read the bible?<br>So, if you want to invent a system of morality because you think people left to their own subjectivity are morally retarded, then we can do that. In fact, we&#039;ve already done that: it&#039;s called society. Society is ruled by the government as a moral authority, society makes laws that are supposed to represent the morality of society, society teaches people what they should and should not do, and so on. And I personally see no reason why we should rely on an ancient small society of Canaanites to make our rules, when we can do our own.","time":1493443184,"resto":123285783,"id":"JSEpu21q","country":"RO","country_name":"Romania"},{"no":123300005,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)01:25:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123288305\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123288305<\/a><br>Is this bait?","time":1493443542,"resto":123285783,"id":"prDj9Rzo","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123300033,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)01:25:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123296750\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123296750<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Religious populace <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Preserve traditional values<\/span><br>Oh, is that why Europe is importing Muslims?<br><br>You&#039;re obviously not talking about the modern Christians, who&#039;s values are incredibly different to any values of the past.

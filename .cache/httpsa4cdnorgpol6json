How many fights have you been in, and where are you from?","com":"I grew up with two brothers, so naturally we fought all the time. As we grew up our fights got more intense, to the point where we would destroy furniture and get quite abusive. I have many memories of me punching my brother in the face or getting punched myself ( over and over.. and over.. and over ), getting kicked hard while lying in the fetal position, attempting to reach his eyes and gouge them out.. etc. <br><br>In college one of my roommates and me just didn&#039;t get along. Tbh it was mostly him being an ass but whatever. One time he jumped me, we tussled a bit and I got thrown into the stove, breaking it, we ended up on the floor with me bashing in his face, but somehow he turned me over and did the same to me until eventually he just quit because he realized I was losing consciousness.<br><br>One time, I was at this party and I&#039;m not sure what happened exactly but I was being a drunk asshole to cut it short. I got my shit wrecked, basically. <br><br>And one time, I was talking to this girl whose boyfriend, drunk, all of a sudden puts me in a headlock.

I ask because I&#039;m working with this guy and it&#039;s really important I maintain a good relationship with<br>him, but tonight this man is telling me he&#039;s been in like an endless number of fights. Which made me wonder, maybe it&#039;s just that I haven&#039;t been in many. It really just sounds like he&#039;s lying out of his ass though. But I&#039;m amazed, if so, at his ability to lie. Not just how well he does it, if this is the case, but how he lives with it.<br><br>I&#039;m asking here because this is an anonymous forum and also, it&#039;s the most masculine board on 4chan.

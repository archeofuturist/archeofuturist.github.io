I spent a year living and teaching in Okinawa (inb4 JET memes), and I honestly believe that my time there was my first stepping stone on the way to becoming a redpilled, more conservatively-minded person.

Even if you&#039;re white\/American, the types of foreigner they actually like. Everyday people stare at you walking down the street, children point and laugh, in class they mock our accents (literally the equivalent of standing up in front of a Japanese exchange student and shouting &quot;CHING CHONG NIP NAP&quot; at them) - the list goes on and on. I couldn&#039;t imagine being black, brown, or, God forbid, a woman in that country.<br><br>HOWEVER, never in my life have I felt such a connection to a foreign people as I did with the Japanese. Maybe its their nomikai society, where the workplace regularly gets together and gets shitfaced on a Tuesday; maybe it&#039;s their ritualized politeness standards, where everyone has a place in the hierarchy and we all play our part to make sure the machine runs smoothly; but regardless, despite my seething anger at being a baka gaijin during the day, I couldn&#039;t wait to join my colleagues, many of whom were just as racist as passersby on the streets, for a long night of drinking, speech-giving, and delicious Okinawan fare. All your hang-ups disappear in that setting. It&#039;s something the West has lost. We no longer know what&#039;s near and what&#039;s far. We can&#039;t keep foreigners are arm&#039;s length during the day only to bring them in close at night, as true brothers in a humanistic sense.

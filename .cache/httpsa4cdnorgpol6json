And they can&#039;t participate in these politics because they consider these ideologies &quot;cuckoldry&quot;. They want an ideology that isn&#039;t necessarily smart or practical or well-organized, but that appears to be to appeal to their surface-level taste. Because these people live for that mindless self-validation. They don&#039;t actually understand what makes for good nation-building diplomacy or good economic structure, nor have they ever picked a book about economics. It doesn&#039;t interest their infantile LARPing sensibilities. They want to pretend they do so and circlejerk themselves, that&#039;s what matters. &quot;Facism&quot; is just perfect for its demographic: these same college-age\/under-age self-important RPers who &quot;fucking love hitler&quot;.

Their &quot;alt right&quot; ideology doesn&#039;t actually have the tact to offer an interesting presentation and discussion of any economics, so they spouts these edgy RolePlay memes taken straight out of propaganda videos. Nevermind about the fact that their entire political ideas are an irrelevant, forgettable piles of garbage that gets dismissed by actual mature conservatives today, or how their depiction of people who disagree with them have somehow been reduced to even more obnoxious caricatures than before, none of these things matter.

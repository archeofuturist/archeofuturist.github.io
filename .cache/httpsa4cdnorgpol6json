Thanks for clarifying. Anyway this reminds me of the story of Lucifer, you know being the highest and falling down and becoming the lowest, so as I found out (there are multiple correct levels of interpretation to this story I&#039;d say) Lucifer from one point of view represents\/symbolizes the Sun from dawn till the time of its setting, symbolizing (from this certain viewpoint which is I think is the whole point of the story) egoism, the feeling of pride and likewise chasing deceitful shadows (materialism) yet ultimately it all comes to an end, using biblical terminology it can be said it signifies the flesh, the flesh and the spirit are incompatible with each other, likewise I heard Sadhguru or was it Santos Bonacci mention the struggle of the higher self verses the lower self, and this type of teachings I assume is not new at all but very old, speaking of the east (India, etc) that is. Anyways I said that because the Sun symbolize Lucifer and both the OT God quite well from different viewpoints, and actually it can be said Lucifer indeed is the Sun.","time":1493326348,"resto":123069297,"id":"Zmbn6fN\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123086716,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)16:57:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123085143\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123085143<\/a><br>Christianity has a tradition of natural theology.

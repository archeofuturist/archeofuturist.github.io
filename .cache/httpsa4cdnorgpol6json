Spic countries have the highest homicide rates in the world, to point that Uganda and the Congo look peaceful.<br>5. Spics are not White. The average Mexican is 57% Native, 37% European, and 5% African. This is barely &quot;Whiter&quot; than Africans Americans who are on average 25% European.<br>6.

The most successful Spic nations are barely wealthier than the absolute poorest European nations.<br>8. Spics have significantly higher obesity rates than Whites.<br>9.

There is no \u201cmelting pot.\u201d We had laws in place to exclude all non-White immigrants. Since the US was formed, it has always been 80-90% Non-Spic White, comparable to European countries. The remaining population was black and could not vote or hold significant power. So who created the politics? The laws? The economy? The technology? Whites. That\u2019s why the US is a White nation.

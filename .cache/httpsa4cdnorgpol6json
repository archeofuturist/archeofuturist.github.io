Harris makes the mistake of jusging God by the lense of the same culture which took from the world which was shaped by Christianity and then says &quot;we made all this by ourselves!&quot;. When he then speaks of narcisism, he does not understand Christianity: I had misery in my life, I was raped and yet I still believe, I care for others and I want to be a tool for Him. <br>The speech about &quot;slavery and witchcraft&quot; are the usual bollocks: the Church was the one who made the trials for witches, sure, but also gave them a defender, a proto-lawer, to speak in their behalf to try and save them. He is comparing also Islam to Christianity, apples and oranges (and no, killing in the name of God is not a good thing, it is an extreme tool and can be used only in a situation in which you must protect the weak or your own kin). Also the joke about the holy Host and th lack of miracles: there are still miracles happening here and there, and there&#039;s a well documented miracle about a &quot;cracker&quot; for the mass that tuned into blood and flesh. <br>Jesus opened a door, then it&#039;s up to us to walk into it, God never force us to save ourselves because He leaves us free.<br><br>He makes also the foolish mistake to say that Christianity is the same as the cults of the pagans who buried children alive.","time":1491644191,"resto":120098510,"id":"Lqq8U3I9","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120114758,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)06:09:32","name":"foxfire","com":"<a href=\"#p120098510\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120098510<\/a><br>definately an atheist it has noting to do with my political affiliation I was simpley born atheist when I saw religion latr in life I knew it was fucked up shit. suck my dick indeed god and while youre at it ream my ass","time":1491646172,"resto":120098510,"id":"cjVy8dCd","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120117737,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)06:50:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"agnostic master race","time":1491648612,"resto":120098510,"id":"zFSWbDVE","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":120118174,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)06:56:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120098510\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120098510<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I fear that anti-religious sentiments are contributing to the fall of western civilization.<\/span><br>Grow up, you fuckwitted manchild.

Hitler aimed to unite the right and left, including workers and their bosses, into a new German nation based on racial identity. Socialism, in contrast, was a class war between workers, bosses, and owners (Capitalists), aiming to build a workers state in which race and gender were insignificant.

Marxist socialism was egalitarian, whereas NatSoc believed that nature was unequal and required competition. Marxist socialism wanted to nationalize all private industry, while NatSoc privatized every major industry except the railroads (it considered these a military asset. In fact, Hitler once joked &quot;they didn&#039;t need to nationalize property because they nationalized people&quot;. NatSoc drew on a range of pan-German theories, which wanted to blend Aryan workers and Aryan magnates into a super Aryan state, which would involve the eradication of class-focused socialism as a non-German ideology.","time":1491649554,"resto":120118874,"id":"eZAWXsvG","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120119063,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)07:07:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"\u5350 - MYTHS ABOUT NATSOC (Part 2)<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;National Socialism is just (((socialism)))&quot;<\/span><br> <br>NatSoc redefined socialism as &quot;Germanism\/Volkism&quot;, which they saw as &quot;producer-oriented capitalism&quot;, as opposed to &quot;Jewish capitalism&quot;, aka, international finance, globalism, wall street, etc. In theory, NatSoc economics was a version of Keynesianism, tailored to the V\u00f6lkisch nature of whichever people adopted it. Its not one dogmatic economic system,and Hitler often joked that the lack of a specific ideology was their strength. NatSoc could be more &quot;free market&quot; as Americans know it, or less.

The Soviet system failed, as did the Roman Empire, and every Chinese or Ottoman dynasty. Some of these examples of government lasted thousands of years, while some didn&#039;t last more than a generation. All forms of government inevitably fail. This has been true since ancient times.

Germany, Italy, and the US were operating under Keynesean policies; only one of them won the war, and experienced a massive period of growth once their industrial rivals were destroyed.

To claim that &quot;living space&quot; meant solely &quot;to exterminate and re-populate more land than there would have been Germans to inhabit, for several generations after the war&quot; is absurd, and contradicts the policies of &quot;Germanization&quot; that were ACTUALLY PRACTICED by the Germans regarding their Slavic allies:<br> <br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=8ra<wbr>-ChcOiuU<br> <br>Hitler didn&#039;t consider Russians subhuman.

He even talks about how some Russians of the old rich class were Germanic. There were multiple reasons for the invasion of the Soviet Union, for example:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;1. To gain the necessary resources to fuel a long time war, something that Germany was severely lacking.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;2.

Prevezon, is on the brink of going to trial in Manhattan \u2014 right in the middle of a massive shakeup of federal prosecutors by President Trump.<br><br>In court filings, the Department of Justice alleges that Prevezon, a Cyprus-based real estate company owned by a Russian national, purchased several New York City apartments with funds linked to a decade-old $230 million tax fraud case \u2014 the biggest in Russian history \u2014 perpetrated by gangsters and corrupt officials. In court filings, Prevezon says the DOJ has no hard evidence to back up its claims.<br><br>Last week, after plenty of drama, Trump fired Preet Bharara, the high-profile US attorney who was handling the case. Now prominent New York City defense attorney Marc Mukasey \u2014 the son of former US Attorney General Michael Mukasey, who at one point was defending Prevezon \u2014 is reportedly on the shortlist to replace Bharara.<br><br>How much do you wanna bet that Cyprus-based real estate firm has ties to the Bank of Cyprus?

There is one American who was in the middle of that bank, who was the single largest shareholder in that bank. There`s one American in that bank.

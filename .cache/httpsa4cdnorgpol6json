As fetuses develop, all are outfitted with the anatomical precursors to nipples, although they only offer a direct reproductive advantage to women for feeding their babies. But since that&#039;s such a favorable trait, evolution didn&#039;t go to the painstaking trouble of weeding nipples out of the male population. In other words, men have nipples because women do. Likewise, clitoral and penile tissues are borne of the same embryological stuff, developing into one or the other once biological sex traits set in. The hooded glans, packed with 8,000 nerve endings, is just the visible tip of the internal clitoral structure that extends up and around the vagina and engorges during arousal much like the penis [source: Gonzalez]. Therefore, female orgasms could exist because that clitoral anatomy was under no evolutionary pressure to disappear.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;http:\/\/health.howstuffworks.com\/se<wbr>xual-health\/sexuality\/orgasm4.htm<\/span><br><br>Thoughts?","filename":"orgasms-4","ext":".jpg","w":360,"h":240,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1490420025878,"time":1490420025,"md5":"EUrzSNpMy\/OVfsE0fbMVYQ==","fsize":8409,"resto":0,"id":"oXfcAT7Z","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"female-orgasm-is-an-evolutionary-byproduct-from","country_name":"United States","replies":4,"images":1},{"no":118191296,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)01:36:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"As long as I cum, I am satisfied.","time":1490420195,"resto":118191051,"id":"Zb6OrjAL","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":118191378,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)01:37:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"no wonder women love black cock","time":1490420237,"resto":118191051,"id":"JcgeB8jJ","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":118191480,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)01:38:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118191051\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118191051<\/a><br>The female orgasm was a mistake.","time":1490420308,"resto":118191051,"id":"J8\/9tbpZ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118191588,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)01:39:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118191378\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118191378<\/a><br><br>How did you come to that conclusion after reading this?

No, sweetie. Drumpf is finished. Let me tell you some secrets:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;two Russian fronts have been under investigation by the FBI since mid-2016; Alfa Bank and SVB Bank<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Trump has significant ties to the Bank of Cyprus through managing director (and new Commerce Secretary) Wilbur Ross and chairman Joseph Ackerman, former head of Deutsche Bank who has loaned Trump&#039;s corporations over $3 billion since the 90s. Bank of Cyprus is a front for Putin and Russian Oligarchs via 10% ownership, Dimitry Rybolovlev and that its known to be where Russian Billionaires stash their money.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Rybolovlev purchased Maison de L&#039;Amitie from Trump for $95 million, after Trump paid $41 million for it four years earlier. To some this might seem like a savvy real estate deal \u2014 however, in the context of the vast money laundering schemes involving Deutsche Bank, Russian Billionaires, and New York Real Estate, followed by Trump&#039;s immediate repayment of a close-to-default $50 million dollar loan to Deutsche Bank, it looks like a money laundering scheme to get money out of Russia, and in to Trump&#039;s hands. At this point, Trump became inextricably compromised by Russia. This is why he won&#039;t release his tax returns - it will reveal the extent of his current liabilities and who owns them (hint: it&#039;s Russians)<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Rybolovlev also owns MKATE \u2014 a plane which made about 25-30 stops in bizarre airports around the US throughout the Presidential Campaign; suspicious since these are places a Russian billionaire has no business going and almost always overlapping with the presence of Trump&#039;s 757. The secret: it was for Michael Cohen to move in and out of the country without record of transit. There&#039;s also a second set of planes that took Cohen&#039;s family around the world that also overlap with MKATE and would allow for surreptitious travel.<\/span><br><br>cont.","filename":"1485827836453","ext":".png","w":554,"h":618,"tn_w":224,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491262260243,"time":1491262260,"md5":"\/Dm\/hGPs+\/WOWKMrkksPrw==","fsize":119513,"resto":0,"id":"fbJ9bkPs","country":"AU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"insider-information-on-trump-investigation","country_name":"Australia","replies":65,"images":23,"omitted_posts":60,"omitted_images":21},{"no":119409253,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)21:10:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119408471\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119408471<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;lel here a baby I&#039;m hardcore :^)<\/span><br><br>Go back to \/b\/ little one.","time":1491268222,"resto":119398013,"id":"wP29ZUGP","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119409488,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)21:12:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"mediocre shitpost thread from mediocre shitpost country<br><br>know this OP, if ever a leaf wanted to they could create a bullshit Russian info shitpost that made this look like babies first time crawling across the fucking keyboard","time":1491268336,"resto":119398013,"id":"hKUd3B7v","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119409489,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)21:12:16","name":"Hope You Have A Strong Stomach","com":"<a href=\"#p119409253\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119409253<\/a><br>Im just warming up","filename":"Feminist","ext":".jpg","w":1030,"h":1100,"tn_w":117,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491268336604,"time":1491268336,"md5":"yAbHH2p+xE1bp\/nKXzJbWg==","fsize":704529,"resto":119398013,"id":"4WKwSgVc","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":119409569,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)21:13:03","name":"How does this make you feel?","com":"Does it make you hungry?","filename":"How the fuck was the cut so clean","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":375,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1491268383395,"time":1491268383,"md5":"8uVoO8w9XGrsapoF1YYfMQ==","fsize":32086,"resto":119398013,"id":"4WKwSgVc","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119409693,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)21:14:00","name":"What does this mean?","com":"<a href=\"#p119409253\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119409253<\/a><br>Look women, where they belong :)","filename":"Piked Up","ext":".jpg","w":253,"h":199,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":98,"tim":1491268440241,"time":1491268440,"md5":"LGCpdjKxFwrh6zNJtq7rTA==","fsize":7906,"resto":119398013,"id":"4WKwSgVc","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":119409314,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)21:10:48","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Why aren&#039;t turks in the EU?","com":"they are european, no?","filename":"typical_turk","ext":".jpg","w":1598,"h":886,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":138,"tim":1491268248284,"time":1491268248,"md5":"Ihb13kI24Bb2ThOiGKYubg==","fsize":414671,"resto":0,"id":"xBVHlm2L","country":"RO","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"why-arent-turks-in-the-eu","country_name":"Romania","replies":1,"images":1},{"no":119409478,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)21:12:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"How do you make this effect on photoshop?","filename":"1475080086370","ext":".jpg","w":552,"h":599,"tn_w":115,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491268333425,"time":1491268333,"md5":"F6E8+azCuGXh3BVE9a6fcw==","fsize":25970,"resto":119409314,"id":"DevIKcG0","country":"TR","country_name":"Turkey"}]},{"posts":[{"no":119409474,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)21:12:11","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Do kikes have no sense of irony?","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;discover people posting mean Jew comments<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;threaten to ruin their careers<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;oy gevalt, shlomo, surely THIS will convince the goyim that we aren&#039;t the problem&quot;<\/span>","filename":"kek","ext":".png","w":536,"h":852,"tn_w":157,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491268331770,"time":1491268331,"md5":"63HJqRtpySonreZi5psESg==","fsize":315902,"resto":0,"id":"jhmO71Io","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"do-kikes-have-no-sense-of-irony","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":119408773,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)21:06:00","name":"Anonymous","sub":"High School Clubs","com":"\/pol\/ I&#039;ve been going to a new (((high school))) this year.

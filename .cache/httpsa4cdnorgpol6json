In these articles, Sarsour states that feminism and Zionism are incompatible. [For Mayim\u2019s most recent comment on this subject, see below for embedded Facebook post or click here.]<br><br>Sarsour said, \u201cThere is no country in this world that is immune to violating human rights.

There are Zionists who are critical of certain Israeli policies and those who are not; there are Zionists who are anti-occupation and there are Zionists who are pro-settlement; and there are Zionists who fall between these extremes. The definitions of Zionism and feminism are not in conflict with each other.

Absolutely. And being a Zionist doesn\u2019t mean a definitional indifference to this suffering, especially of Palestinian women and children. The question is this: Many countries \u2013 many Muslim countries, in fact \u2013 perpetrate atrocities against women which include: female genital mutilation, forced marriages, child brides, systematic abuse of women by the justice system, revenge rape and honor killing. Why is Israel held to a standard none of these other countries \u2013 whose offenses are, arguably more extreme \u2013 are held to? And why is belief in the State of Israel something that should exclude women \u2013 or men, for that matter \u2013 from identifying as feminists?<br><br>Bigotry<br><br>Accusing Zionism of being incompatible with feminism is exceptionally short-sighted. It smarts of a broad-stroke bias against the entire Jewish people for the violations that occur in a state that was founded on the principles of Zionism. That\u2019s not good. Bad things happen when we paint with such a broad brush. It\u2019s bigotry.<br><br>Divisiveness<br><br>Ultimately, for a feminist activist \u2013 or any activist \u2013 to place the blame for policies made by a few people on the entire entity of Zionism and all who are committed to the idea of a Jewish state is irresponsible. It\u2019s disgusting, it\u2019s insulting, and it\u2019s wrong. It creates fragmentation in a movement that needs cohesion, needs to stand together for equality, domestically and internationally.<br><br>As a feminist Zionist, I can\u2019t believe I am being asked to choose or even defend my religious, historical and cultural identity.

He became more and more obsessed with the idea of nazism, &quot;alt-right&quot; ideologies, and has been isolated from the general public at his high school. He lost his friends over time and can hardly relate to anybody at his school. Teachers are feeding him &quot;lies&quot; and the liberalism is unbearable. He doesn&#039;t feel like he belongs anywhere. Today he tried to commit suicide, and had notes in his room that related to things seen here that seemed to be schizophrenically written out. 4chan was definitely a reason for his depression. He would sit in his room all day and browse, learn about nazism and watch Sam Hyde shit. This website radicalized my brother to the point where he went over the edge and did not understand how to cope with all the things learned. I just wanted to vent and see if any of ya&#039;ll could relate.

If gun-control advocates only consider times when guns are used badly, then of course it would seem like that&#039;s all they can do. But this assumption is mistaken for a few reasons:<br>1) not all firearms are inevitably used badly, nor are they incapable of being used for good purposes.<br>2) when a firearm is abused, it is only the fault of the user. It makes no sense in principle to &quot;blame&quot; and &quot;punish&quot; a technology for being used badly, because if you removed the guns then there would still be bad people. It&#039;s the bad people, armed or otherwise, that are the problem, and if you remove firearms from general use, then the net result is that you&#039;ve removed a means (moreover, the most effective means) for individual citizens to &quot;solve&quot; the problem of bad people (including and especially organizations) trying to harm them in any way, via firearm or otherwise.","time":1492662253,"resto":121939532,"id":"AauCeE9k","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121951548,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)00:25:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121947833\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121947833<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121948493\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121948493<\/a><br><br><a href=\"#p121951390\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121951390<\/a> continued:<br>3) this may sound like a kinda silly point, but it&#039;s not the fault of firearms that people die; it&#039;s peoples&#039; mortal condition. Firearms, if you see them as a technology, are there to help you defend your life against various types of antagonists. Technologies in general, including firearms, will never go away in principle because they are permitted by the laws of physics, the laws of nature--and no artificial law can veto or overwrite natural law. Thus, you cannot truly outlaw firearms. So you are left with the choice to use the technologies available to you to maintain and secure your survival; this is a kind of universal common theme in human behavior, that is, using tools to survive and thrive. So, firearms are there whether you (kind of speaking to gun-grabber) like it or not, and if you choose not to use this technology--if you are too reluctant or mentally feeble to take whatever action reasonably effective to secure your life--then you are bound to die, sooner or later, by firearm or not. Because you are fundamentally weak, and natural selection hates weakness.","time":1492662338,"resto":121939532,"id":"AauCeE9k","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":121940048,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)22:43:42","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Debate tips","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt; be me<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Work at office job<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Co-worker is Mexican drag queen anchor baby<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Literally not even exaggerating<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Constantly pops off about white privilege and when challenged explains that it is impossible to be racist against white people<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Surprisingly intelligent but clearly deluded<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Boss heard the rants but does nothing but mumble under his breath<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Challenge with my argument<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; He is not offended and willing to debate believe it or not, actually seems to enjoy the challenge<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Says white people have no culture<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Brags about Mexican culture but admits he would never want to go back due to gang violence and government corruption<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Wants me to come get his hair did with him<\/span><br><br>How do I argue with this guy pol???","filename":"IMG_0545","ext":".jpg","w":4032,"h":3024,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1492656222858,"time":1492656222,"md5":"O2pymyCtxzR0kVzBeapqNQ==","fsize":1730547,"resto":0,"id":"on3ztB39","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"debate-tips","country_name":"United States","replies":27,"images":2,"omitted_posts":22,"omitted_images":2},{"no":121950050,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)00:11:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121940048\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121940048<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;do all of above<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;go back to his\/your place<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;fucc<\/span>","time":1492661461,"resto":121940048,"id":"FW+upjkA","country":"PH","country_name":"Philippines"},{"no":121950064,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)00:11:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121940048\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121940048<\/a><br>Git yur hurr did wit him and red pill all his faggot friends.","time":1492661467,"resto":121940048,"id":"e+zUhPCN","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121950256,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)00:13:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121943373\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121943373<\/a><br>There&#039;s no such thing as a sanctuary city.","time":1492661583,"resto":121940048,"id":"o5ZFWqxF","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121950359,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)00:14:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121940048\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121940048<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mexican drag queen<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;intelligent<\/span><br>I am incredibly skeptical.

Contrary to what the Anglo-Saxon savage has taught you, Celtic nations are not exclusive to the British Isles, in fact we are one of the most diverse group of peoples in Western Europe, ranging from Asturias all the way to Breizh.

I&#039;m mostly Celtic (Welsh and Irish) and I appreciate Celtic culture, but I can&#039;t stand how so many of them make the basis of their culture a hatred of the English. You observe practically any Celtic thread and it will be full of anti-English rhetoric and circlejerking, even when no Anglos are present in the thread. It&#039;s fucking pathetic.","time":1492179104,"resto":121046308,"id":"isknz\/FL","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121064440,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)10:15:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121064073\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121064073<\/a><br>but anglos are disgusting people regardless of the subject?","time":1492179305,"resto":121046308,"id":"v7C+6vgn","country":"TR","country_name":"Turkey"},{"no":121067202,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)10:41:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121064073\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121064073<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;make a thread about celtic culture and achievements and general pride<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;anglos come in and start shitting all over it<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;we roast them<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&#039;oi w-why this h-hated of f-fellow whites?&#039;<\/span><br><br>Softest bunch of cunts.","time":1492180865,"resto":121046308,"id":"Yo5RaFjr","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"}]},{"posts":[{"no":121064437,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)10:15:04","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Drug Dealers Can&#039;t Stop Flashing Cash Online","com":"http:\/\/nypost.com\/2017\/04\/13\/drug-d<wbr>ealers-cant-stop-flashing-cash-onli<wbr>ne-and-its-landing-them-in-jail\/<br><br>In the Oregon town of Scappoose, a knuckleheaded high schooler by the name of Brayden Garza was made to stay late after class while law enforcers raided a home loaded with the weed he sold.

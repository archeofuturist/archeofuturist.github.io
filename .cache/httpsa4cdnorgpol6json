He called it the last man and the religion of comfortableness. Upon his announcement that God was dead and that we had murdered him our forefathers searched the news papers for happenings in vain as we do today here on \/pol\/. We wait and wait for something anything we don&#039;t quite know what we are waiting for but we believe we will know it when we see it. I had believed that Jung was right when he said, &quot;Christianity split the Germanic barbarian into an upper and a lower half, and enabled him, by repressing the dark side, to domesticate the brighter half and fit it for civilization. But the lower, darker half still awaits redemption and a second spell of domestication. Until then, it will remain associated with the vestiges of the prehistoric age, with the collective unconscious, which is subject to a peculiar and ever-increasing activation. As the Christian view of the world loses its authority, the more menacingly will the \u201cblond beast\u201d be heard prowling about in its underground prison, ready at any moment to burst out with devastating consequences. When this happens in the individual it brings about a psychological revolution, but it can also take a social form.&quot; But I now understand what Fyodor Dostoevsky meant by man as a piano key. There is no need to domesticate us if our women can be domesticated. That is what has occurred and continues to occur. We have intellectualized life. We have rationalized our extinction. We have become ok with it. We are now piano keys.","filename":"th","ext":".jpg","w":266,"h":300,"tn_w":110,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493886060086,"time":1493886060,"md5":"HWkTyeVGJKYM7r1glggkPw==","fsize":7456,"resto":124029758,"id":"Z3M4Lt87","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124039074,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)04:36:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;0%<\/span>","filename":"hillary trump xcom","ext":".jpg","w":680,"h":645,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":118,"tim":1493886993432,"time":1493886993,"md5":"EniAGzJxxClmbXjI22Dzow==","fsize":51961,"resto":124029758,"id":"EQ0O+8PC","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":124019134,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)00:36:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"The last few weeks, since I started watching Jordan Peterson lectures daily, I&#039;ve been waking up in the morning with &quot;epiphanies&quot; about my behavior.<br><br>Today&#039;s epiphany was that I associate my positive reward emotions with negative actions in my life.

Wars of aggression, even in the name of liberation, will never be supported by the party. Alliances will not be taken lightly thus, meaning some current agreements may require reconsideration in regards to the risk and reward factor that it poses the state. The state will also resist the attempts of any foreign power, ally or not, to influence the internal politics or society of the nation. Continued attempts at the influence of the nation from a foreign power will eventually lead to economic sanctions or potentially the severing of diplomatic ties until operations cease and an official apology is issued. Due to the isolationist stance, an overwhelming military like that of the current United States will not be necessary, though the nation will never disarm or leave itself weak in contrast to neighbors or other powerful spheres of influence.

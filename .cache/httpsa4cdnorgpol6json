What are your thoughts?<br><br>Here is my assessment: World wars happen when major powers seek to grow in a world which has no room. Russia and China are the two main powers whose growth is being limited by NATO and its allies. This is why Putin wants to influence elections in France and the United States. If he can divide Europe and weaken the Euro, he can, by proxy, increase Russia&#039;s relative economic and diplomatic clout. China is a rapidly emerging superpower with similar interests, but is currently being held in check by the United States and its allies. Both nations have expressed interest in greatly enhancing their military capacities as a form of recourse for their economic woes. If they cannot win the economic game, it is likely that they will begin to become more aggressive to increase their negotiating power. It is my estimation that we are witnessing the beginning stages of this, and that it will culminate in a third world war. As the world becomes more and more isolationist, the greater the tensions.","filename":"wwiii","ext":".jpg","w":1600,"h":900,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1493022117012,"time":1493022117,"md5":"pya4zZ\/Qng8zV78J6z0ekA==","fsize":373618,"resto":0,"id":"3ve2ndv\/","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"is-there-actually-any-chance-that-we-are-heading","country_name":"United States","replies":16,"images":0,"omitted_posts":11,"omitted_images":0},{"no":122564348,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)04:45:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"Also, there are some limited but significant parallels between the time leading up to WWI and now.","time":1493023543,"resto":122562674,"id":"3ve2ndv\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122564501,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)04:47:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122562674\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122562674<\/a><br>Anyone that goes to war with the USA will get wiped out.

You people think your opinions are so important and that you possess some natural-born expertise. But take it from ME, a REAL expert, when I say your comments are even more stupider than you people making them. Now I have a lot of experience, so when I say something, it counts. That&#039;s because I&#039;m very important and I know what I&#039;m talking about, unlike feeble-minded you. I see you want to retort by posting a reply, do you? PSHAW!!! You can&#039;t post a reply to me because you&#039;re speechless, and you&#039;re too AFRAID. Besides, no one wants to hear your stupidness anyway.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Do you know who I am? I have 9 black belts, 15 Masters degrees and a PhD in Applied Arithmetic. That&#039;s right, you know I&#039;m way better than you, and all my fans and supporters will gladly tell you how great and awesome I am! Have you seen my power level? It&#039;s over 9000! You know what that means? It means I have more than 9000 units of POWER. It also puts my total adjusted force rating at 22000! That&#039;s more than triple, so you don&#039;t want to make me mad because anger is my middle name, and I give love a bad name, which only makes me angrier.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Remember: He who laughs last, laughs last. So, go ahead, I dare you to write a reply to my comment. I DOUBLE dare you to write a reply to my comment. But I know you won&#039;t reply to my comment because YOU&#039;RE ALL TOO AFRAID.<\/span><br>fresh pasta?","time":1493023952,"resto":122561890,"id":"UBme1H7M","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":122559664,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)03:41:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"Who else \/trumpgret\/ here?","filename":"1493019216433","ext":".jpg","w":720,"h":480,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1493019704512,"time":1493019704,"md5":"5VSXN7axhErAjTFgjxm54Q==","fsize":239182,"resto":0,"id":"VnqGbbve","country":"SE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"who-else-trumpgret-here","country_name":"Sweden","replies":17,"images":4,"omitted_posts":12,"omitted_images":4},{"no":122564496,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)04:47:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"No regrets because Hilldawg would have been worse andvl8beral tears were worth it.

Simply because there is too much antisemitism. I&#039;m jewish myself and i find this sentiment highly offensive. You can&#039;t be truly politically enlightened if you&#039;re racist. <br><br>I&#039;ve seen the hate thats on this board in many threads, calling people the K word because they have a different opinion, worshipping hitler, making fun of 6 million innocent people that perished because of who they were, it&#039;s totally absurd and repulsive, not &quot;enlightened&quot;.<br><br>The racism doesn&#039;t even end there, it transcends into a hatred for black people and muslims too, without considering the oppression especially blacks have to deal with on a day to day basis. Things didn&#039;t just magically get better for black people once slavery ended. They aren&#039;t stupid people either, i have a black friend who&#039;s studying sociology with me and he has a 3.8 gpa so far, with a full scholarship. I dont see many white people have full scholarships to be honest, which is just impossible to ignore.<br><br>I hope you guys one day realize that we are all equal and we are all stronger when we work together, take it from a jew whos grandfather was killed in nazi germany.","filename":"keep-calm-and-lets-all-get-along","ext":".png","w":600,"h":700,"tn_w":214,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493332437420,"time":1493332437,"md5":"UVQ1b4r6R37VtSNnvlfkIQ==","fsize":43569,"resto":0,"id":"is\/G7h1u","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"a-friend-of-mine-has-been-nagging-me-to-visit","country_name":"United States","replies":10,"images":1,"omitted_posts":5,"omitted_images":1},{"no":123103582,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)18:48:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123101524\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123101524<\/a><br><a href=\"#p123101614\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123101614<\/a><br>Fuck off self replying kike.

Where you in agreement on most matters? Did you keep any subjects off topic? How seriously did you discuss topics, how much was satire, and how much was a mix of both? Have you stayed in touch?

The apartment was in Brooklyn, in a mixed White and Latino neighborhood, that had not gentrified too much yet (this was a few years back) so not too many SJWS\/brunch loving yuppies, and the lationos were mostly hard working south americans with families and a desire to improve their neighborhood. Most didnt mind some white kids moving in, because a little bump in rent was worth pushing out the bums, criminals, and most importantly, the niggers.

The GOP is far too divided even with a majority in congress. Forcing them to stop all of their pointless arguing that does nothing and actually vote on it is the only way out of this mess. They&#039;ve already spent over 4 months on it and accomplished nothing, and I think Trump would rather call a loss and force Congress to address other issues that the GOP is less divided on rather than waste even more time on this train wreck. If Obamacare starts failing halfway through the term like Trumps team says it will than repealing it will gain enough support from the whole of the GOP that the bill can be passed, or it won&#039;t fall and Trump will already be focused on doing other things.","filename":"images","ext":".png","w":119,"h":95,"tn_w":119,"tn_h":95,"tim":1490479917511,"time":1490479917,"md5":"Hzi+QQhl3C\/\/kBaQAjJNig==","fsize":2909,"resto":118276443,"id":"VKPXxq48","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118279609,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)18:12:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118279370\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118279370<\/a><br>I have Tyrone on speed dial, I&#039;ve been increasingly in need of his services of late","time":1490479934,"resto":118276443,"id":"s8v0qF87","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118276494,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)17:45:00","name":"Anonymous","sub":"\/MCGA\/ Make Canada Great Again General","com":"MAKE CANADA GREAT AGAIN<br><br>BIG NEWS IN FROM LEAFISTAN<br><br>CONSERVATIVE PARTY IS NOW POLLING AHEAD OF TRUDEAU, AND THIS IS WITHOUT A LEADER<br><br>CONSERVATIVES ARE AT 38% WHICH MEANS THEY ARE IN MAJORITY OF SEATS TERRITORY WHEREAS LIBERALS ARE DOWN TO 36%<br><br>To top it all off?

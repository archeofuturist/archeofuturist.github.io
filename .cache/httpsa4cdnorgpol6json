It is control.<br><br>Not all governments who have the power to provide a good life for you are bad, and neither were all slave owners bad. Many slave owners believed that in order to have productive workers, they needed the slaves to have a decent living. Keep them happy, give them adequate food and shelter, provide decent living conditions, and the slaves won&#039;t mind being a slave with no freedom. They consider the alternative, living in a shitty country with terrible living conditions, fighting for your life against other tribes, against wildlife, against disease, and so many other terrible things. Because their slave owner treats them well, they rationalize their situation as a good thing. They have a job, food, a home, a bed, and safety from animals and savages who would kill them. But just because SOME slave owners treated their slaves fairly and provided a decent life for them, doesn&#039;t mean that slavery is good, because most slave owners treated their slaves like shit. They abused their power, and provided just enough to prevent their slaves from revolting or dying. <br><br>So in a sense, the institution of slavery is very much a small scale form of a welfare based government. I would argue that Socialism and Communism is large scale slavery, and liberals and progressives slowly implement socialist laws and agendas, taking slow and tiny steps, inching our way towards socialism, because if they did it fast all at once, their would be revolution. Like I said before, they do as much as they can get away with, and they know exactly how much they can get away with, they have mastered the art of taking our freedom under the false pretense of making our lives better. <br><br>Part 3\/3 in next post","filename":"IMG_1580","ext":".jpg","w":540,"h":960,"tn_w":70,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491857746128,"time":1491857746,"md5":"+8ZrHcfrSDwgLk9XZPZbnA==","fsize":58443,"resto":120444684,"id":"6bObJmhq","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120489765,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)16:57:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120489571\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120489571<\/a><br><br>(Continued from last post)<br>Part3\/3<br><br>But I don&#039;t want them to have the power to make my life better.

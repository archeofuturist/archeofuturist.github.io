It&#039;s always been like that, hence &quot;Invisible Empire&quot;, yet a good example is a few years back that, some antifa threw rocks at a car with four &quot;Klansmen&quot; in it, the car pulled over and they were all undercover cops and arrested the antifa.

Antifa acting as antagonists for Trump supporters strengthens Trump supporters, and in turn, Trump. The Antifa aren&#039;t going to literally kill anyone, or at least, kill anyone important, and the police will always be ready to arrest the would be problematics.

I don&#039;t think that many people actually hate Russia. But it&#039;s still a predominantly negative view. After few years of observing and interactions, I think I&#039;m able to pinpoint general gist. Here is my humble opinion.<br><br>West treats Russia as a rat infestation. Like their nice, beautiful house, unfortunately, got unwanted occupants. They shit everywhere, they slowly destroy your house inside out, ruin foundation with their digging. You got a terrible smell in your house, they are hosts to the dangerous diseases, disrupt your sleep with noises, they steal your food and generally unpleasant to be around. Horrible, isn&#039;t it? Surely you will want to remove them.<br><br>You really can&#039;t just nuke whole house and be done with it. You&#039;ve gotta live somewhere after all. It would be hard to manually kill each rat, they are sneaky, smart, hide in unreachable places and can breed at dangerous rates. There must be a smart approach. So you hire a specialist to deal with the problem, you starve them out, place traps, make their live impossible with the poison and toxins, there are many ways to deal with them &quot;cleanly&quot;. If you are progressive, intelligent person you really don&#039;t feel hate toward them. Fuck, rats actually are pretty rad pets. But in small counts.

But sensationalism and polarization and other things, I actually think, are probably even stronger and more prolific effects. And we have to work on all these things. I think we need to listen to all the feedback on this.\u201d<br><br>During the interview, Zuckerberg said Facebook\u2019s news feed helps users access more \u201cmeaningful\u201d content, but on the flip side he acknowledged the feed also results in negative consequences, like what happened during the run-up to the 2016 U.S. election. Facebook faced repeated criticism last year that it spread fake news and favored liberal content over more conservative postings. Some have gone as far as to say Facebook had an impact on the election in a way that hadn\u2019t been seen before. (See also: Facebook Adds Dispute Tag to Flag Fake News.)<br><br>In addition to spreading fake news, extremists and terrorist groups have also used Facebook to air their ideas and spread hate to Facebook\u2019s 2 billion users. Those actions, reported the Times, has resulted in Zuckerberg questioning his ideas about building a global community on the social network. &quot;Giving everyone a voice has historically been a very positive force for public discourse because it increases the diversity of ideas shared,&quot; Zuckerberg wrote in a manifesto earlier this year that was discussed during the Times interview. &quot;But the past year has also shown it may fragment our shared sense of reality.&quot;","filename":"zuck","ext":".jpg","w":1930,"h":1148,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":148,"tim":1493212954417,"time":1493212954,"md5":"D9uW1PhDL6s\/uJJ45mWp6A==","fsize":661843,"resto":0,"id":"fG4f7tHl","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"mark-zuckerberg-we-have-to-get-to-the-core-of-the","country_name":"United States","replies":12,"images":3,"omitted_posts":7,"omitted_images":1},{"no":122887293,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)10:12:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122883310\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122883310<\/a><br>Yeah.","time":1493215975,"resto":122882853,"id":"y8DQXqJl","country":"HR","country_name":"Croatia"},{"no":122888001,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)10:20:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122883996\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122883996<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;richest man on the planet<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;married a thai ladyboy<\/span><br><br>JUST","time":1493216405,"resto":122882853,"id":"WrQOy2Zr","country":"IT","country_name":"Italy"},{"no":122888109,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)10:21:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122882853\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122882853<\/a><br>So, wait, is Zuckerberg calling for anudda shoah?","time":1493216464,"resto":122882853,"id":"AZd6GtUo","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122888304,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)10:22:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122886908\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122886908<\/a><br>Steve Buscemi isnt a filthy talentless money hungry kike.","time":1493216579,"resto":122882853,"id":"j8cJGc\/R","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":122888684,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)10:26:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122887053\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122887053<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;jews arent the enemy<\/span>","time":1493216809,"resto":122882853,"id":"oRwhoCLJ","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]},{"posts":[{"no":122887322,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)10:13:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"Memeball thread","filename":"1492719520593","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":454,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":227,"tim":1493215990528,"time":1493215990,"md5":"1Ygb1wSOvXovtHkYJhYo\/w==","fsize":64251,"resto":0,"id":"ANyOk+Gf","country":"LV","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"memeball-thread","country_name":"Latvia","replies":3,"images":3},{"no":122887357,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)10:13:27","name":"Anonymous","filename":"1493197524198","ext":".png","w":589,"h":639,"tn_w":115,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493216007493,"time":1493216007,"md5":"cLh1OiA2MpJyjWsEmtq45Q==","fsize":226493,"resto":122887322,"id":"ANyOk+Gf","country":"LV","country_name":"Latvia"},{"no":122887386,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)10:13:46","name":"Anonymous","filename":"1493196569058","ext":".png","w":589,"h":532,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":112,"tim":1493216026132,"time":1493216026,"md5":"titFfuk7lAyOhCHUs2XRKw==","fsize":212574,"resto":122887322,"id":"ANyOk+Gf","country":"LV","country_name":"Latvia"},{"no":122888658,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)10:26:30","name":"Anonymous","filename":"pol","ext":".jpg","w":1080,"h":1080,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493216790837,"time":1493216790,"md5":"s\/N7D+GN9n3q56w97sOJQQ==","fsize":176967,"resto":122887322,"id":"ul49eiAA","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":122881636,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)09:08:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"Can we forget about the past and start from the beggining?","filename":"Flag-Pins-Russia-Poland","ext":".jpg","w":400,"h":320,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":200,"tim":1493212080479,"time":1493212080,"md5":"buCsThjH0\/Uwcr7RsCSnbg==","fsize":58152,"resto":0,"id":"poID+8ii","country":"PL","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"can-we-forget-about-the-past-and-start-from-the","country_name":"Poland","replies":32,"images":7,"omitted_posts":27,"omitted_images":7},{"no":122886485,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)10:04:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122882992\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122882992<\/a><br>They destroy themselves.

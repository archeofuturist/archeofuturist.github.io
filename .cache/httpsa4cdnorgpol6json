He claims to have found a therapy against cancer with a very high success rate. Yet, he asserts that the (((big pharma industry))) attacks him and does not want that a cure against cancer is found, because it is a billion dollar business. He lost his approbation as a doctor and is not allowed to practice. Also, he is vilified by the (((media))) and (((Wikipedia))), they seem to also cherry pick single cases where his therapy did not work. Dr. Hamer says that chemotherapy is absolutely ineffective and it is rather despite not because of it when patients survive it - it is just a money making machine. One quote of him is &quot;To sell chemotherapy as a &#039;therapy&#039; is most likely the biggest deceit in the history of medicine. Whoever masterminded this chemo-torture deserves a monument in hell.&quot;. Furthermore, he states that there were several attempts to assassinate him and in fact, at one attempt his son Dirk Hamer was accidentially shot instead of him by Vittorio Emanuele of Savoy.<br><br>Also, he states that Jews would know and apply his therapy - and that the cancer therapy rate in Israel is very high as a consequence. So, I used Google and found this article of a Jewish newspaper which is an indicator that this may be true (while they could possibly withold the real data which may be even more positive):<br>http:\/\/www.haaretz.com\/news\/study-i<wbr>srael-has-among-highest-cancer-surv<wbr>ival-rates-in-the-west-1.6181<br><br>As far as I could learn in this short time is that according to Dr. Hamer cancer has a pschosomatic cause which needs to be treated. And it seems to be very true that the psyche has a major influence on the occurence of many illnesses.<br><br>All in all, everything he says seems to be coherent and credible. Still, I cannot verify if his therapy really works in the end. I would need to know the verifiable number of patients he treated and the number he cured.","filename":"Cancer","ext":".jpg","w":1200,"h":617,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":128,"tim":1493104722932,"time":1493104722,"md5":"I0jR1f3JogNRJdOk0r1gYQ==","fsize":217707,"resto":0,"id":"LSPjEU04","country":"NO","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"yesterday-i-discovered-dr-ryke-geerd-hamer-and","country_name":"Norway","replies":7,"images":0,"omitted_posts":2,"omitted_images":0},{"no":122708352,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)03:30:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122707412\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122707412<\/a><br>cronycapitalism effects in healthcare are nothing new<br>their incentive is to make profit, curing does not makes profit in the long term<br>what is new here?","time":1493105442,"resto":122707412,"id":"bmmQ8bpz","country":"CL","country_name":"Chile"},{"no":122708795,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)03:36:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"Up","time":1493105806,"resto":122707412,"id":"au2G3+rr","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":122709068,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)03:40:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122708352\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122708352<\/a><br>It was new to me that a cure of cancer is potentially withhold from us by the (((big pharma industry))).<br><br>Also, I was not fully aware that the psyche may have such a great role on illnesses.<br><br>This article seems to confirm that notion:<br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Stres<wbr>s_(biology)","time":1493106058,"resto":122707412,"id":"LSPjEU04","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":122709447,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)03:46:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122707412\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122707412<\/a><br>Chemo is not scam.

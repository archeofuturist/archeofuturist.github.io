You will either offer up even those upon the cross, or they will be offered up to the Enemy and cast into the flame. There is no third way in which you can have Christ without the cross. You cannot bring your Hell into Heaven, not even one piece of it. Whatsoever you wish to keep, first lay it down. Whatsoever you wish to hold, first allow it to be taken. All of this was written before the Universe was formed, and as it was written, so shall it be.<br><br>The key problem with the right-winger of today is that he wishes to use Christianity as a tool for preserving his place in the world. He understands that our lack of Faith has led us to this terrible moment, but he does not understand that we cannot have both degeneracy and Faith. You cannot fornicate and blaspheme and have your &quot;freedom&quot; and expect the &quot;Social Christianity&quot; to save you from the natural consequences of your twisted lust. How many fools have you seen who pine for a return of &quot;Masculine values&quot; whilst openly engaging in the very hedonism and self-love that destroyed those masculine values? How many have you seen who say:<br><br>&quot;I don&#039;t believe, but I recognize the SOCIAL value of Christianity.&quot; <br><br>These men are even blinder than the Leftist Satanists. They think the value of Christianity was in it&#039;s procurement of Earthly pleasures and Earthly systems. They want the shell of the thing, but they deny the substance. Consequently, they will receive neither Heavenly, nor Earthly, rewards. It was not the traditions and practices that kept Man in his glory, but faith and sacrifice. <br><br>The Muslims know of what I speak. This is why they will destroy both sides; atheist and &quot;Social Christian&quot; alike will be burnt at their altar. They worship a false god, in fact it is my opinion that they worship the Anti-Christ, but at least they have worship. Belief will always destroy desire. Sacrifice will always destroy hedonism. Faith will always destroy Reason.","filename":"1493435329525","ext":".jpg","w":1777,"h":1000,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1493582783259,"time":1493582783,"md5":"oj+T4GV6O\/0Sv9o2McWmIA==","fsize":770216,"resto":123514461,"id":"+1yt40v4","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":123519841,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)16:12:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123519050\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123519050<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;How many fools have you seen who pine for a return of &quot;Masculine values&quot; whilst openly engaging in the very hedonism and self-love that destroyed those masculine values?

Your attitude will make or break people&#039;s attitude towards you. If you feel insecure and self hating, there&#039;s nothing about you to love. If you are self assured and proud, there&#039;s a lot to love. Don&#039;t let shitposting get to you in real life. It&#039;s ALL banter.<br>3. The best strategy for pro whites in America is not to alienate minorities who would be happy to support you. Not all of us are brainwashed to being anti white. We are here to support you.<br>4. Be more rooted in your daily life. Don&#039;t give in to the transiency all around you. Don&#039;t be scared to have small interactions with everybody, including strangers. Be the person that builds trust rather than creates mistrust.<br>5. Always put yourself first.

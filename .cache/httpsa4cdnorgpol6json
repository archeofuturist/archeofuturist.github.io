Countries that support the Syrian government are Russia, China, Iran<br>and Iraq. The anti-Assad axis (countries pushing for regime change in Syria) are: United States, France, UK, Germany, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Qatar, Turkey and Israel. An important reason for this geo-political conflict is control<br>of oil and gas resources in the region. In 2009 Qatar proposed a natural gas pipeline which would have passed through Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Syria, Turkey and into Europe [2]. However, Assad rejected this. Instead in 2011, he formed a pact with Iraq, Iran and Syria to run a pipeline eastward, cutting Qatar and Saudi Arabia out of the arrangement. This gives a strategic advantage to the Shia faction and the Sunnis resent this. It also gives Russia an economic advantage over the US in oil and gas trading.","filename":"ZionistsForTrump","ext":".png","w":1032,"h":263,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":63,"tim":1492829035697,"time":1492829035,"md5":"GZXIhwadaNVhrQ3mkRzv3Q==","fsize":107467,"resto":0,"id":"UWcF2bQY","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"world-war-iii-real-motives-behind-trumps-missile","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":44,"images":6,"omitted_posts":39,"omitted_images":4},{"no":122245404,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)02:19:02","name":"Anonymous","filename":"1491345822081","ext":".jpg","w":571,"h":378,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":82,"tim":1492841942607,"time":1492841942,"md5":"vBiSKIIZSwCFxOUKDr7baA==","fsize":66474,"resto":122225355,"id":"nQ60+Y6y","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122245880,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)02:24:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122243757\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122243757<\/a><br>All you need to know about that is here:<br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=P02<wbr>vjiEZyUs","time":1492842270,"resto":122225355,"id":"UWcF2bQY","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122246054,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)02:26:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122245880\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122245880<\/a><br><a href=\"#p122243757\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122243757<\/a><br><br>There are related videos to that one which also offer valuable insight into it","time":1492842400,"resto":122225355,"id":"UWcF2bQY","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122246555,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)02:33:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122243040\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122243040<\/a><br>Saved that picture.

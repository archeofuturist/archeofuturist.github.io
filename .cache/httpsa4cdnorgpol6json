The NKVD which was almost entirely Jewish from the outset had murdered any halfway intelligent gentile in Russia\/Ukraine and it&#039;s hard to dispute this was the plan for Germany and the rest of Western Europe, the Germans seen this writing on the wall as did nearly all of the western world at the time.

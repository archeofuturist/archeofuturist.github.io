Anything that is toxic to cells kills cancer cells. Cancer drugs are things that kill cancer cells in a selective way. There is no evidence that THC can be used therapeutically to kill cancer. Probably because it&#039;s liposuble so good luck reaching the cells in the first place. There is however a great deal of evidence that THC causes psychosis, especially to those whose brains are still forming (a man&#039;s brain is fully formed in his 40s) and a great deal of evidence that cannabis smoke is carcinogenic.<br><br>Even if we could find a fringe use in which THC is superior to other alternatives (at the moment, there aren&#039;t, as many pain killers do a similar job without getting you high), it STILL wouldn&#039;t be an excuse to legilize cannabis as therapeutic treatment involves dosing and checking for interaction with other drugs, all of which involve a visit to the doctor and a prescription, meaning it still has to be a controlled substance, just like 99% of all medicine.","time":1492119623,"resto":120937817,"id":"+zGMHykw","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":120967872,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)17:41:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120939490\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120939490<\/a><br><a href=\"#p120939492\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120939492<\/a><br><a href=\"#p120940056\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120940056<\/a><br>*tips fedora*","time":1492119699,"resto":120937817,"id":"xgChn9yE","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":120967852,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)17:41:29","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Anti-Defamation League offers to host Holocaust course for Spicer","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) is offering to host a Holocaust education course for Sean Spicer and his staff after the White House press secretary wrongly claimed that Nazi leader Adolf Hitler did not use chemical weapons during World War II. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u201cWhile you have apologized, this week\u2019s incident as well as others (notably the International Holocaust Remembrance Day statement omitting Jews and your vociferous defense of it), have exposed a serious gap in your knowledge of the Holocaust, its impact and the lessons we can learn from it,\u201d ADL chief Jonathan Greenblatt wrote in a letter to Spicer Thursday.<\/span>","filename":"Screen Shot 2017-04-13 at 22.37.36","ext":".png","w":963,"h":963,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492119689334,"time":1492119689,"md5":"Bmpo8URVjXzKmzeKx0bATQ==","fsize":598225,"resto":0,"id":"icQOSxwg","country":"IE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"antidefamation-league-offers-to-host-holocaust","country_name":"Ireland","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":120966393,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)17:29:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;What did you say about the Holocaust anon?<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;My Babciu died in those camps...<\/span>","filename":"1D4E1","ext":".jpg","w":453,"h":453,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492118968104,"time":1492118968,"md5":"m+OoJWaTZ+Ij4r5Yzw\/BjQ==","fsize":87862,"resto":0,"id":"PJSTB5y7","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"what-did-you-say-about-the-holocaust-anon","country_name":"United States","replies":4,"images":1},{"no":120966597,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)17:31:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"I&#039;d knock him out and stick my dick in his tight asshole, licking his ear as he wakes up and feels my full blown erection pounding into his ass.<br>I&#039;m not gay though.","time":1492119074,"resto":120966393,"id":"FYK0Bd63","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120966763,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)17:32:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120966393\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120966393<\/a><br>By great grand parent also died of tiphus.

The small ruling elite. It does not matter at all whether or not you can imagine an event happening. What does matter is that such events can and have occurred elsewhere around the world. Everyone thinks &quot;it will never happen to them&quot; and then it does. There&#039;s no reason to think horrible things couldn&#039;t happen here. To put such a large amount of trust into an institution and body full of people just as flawed as any of us here probably isn&#039;t the best idea. Even outside of government horrible things still happen. Look at France over the last few years. High profile attack after high profile attack and those attackers used illegal weapons. What could the people do to resist? Absolutely nothing seeing as to how they&#039;re virtually disarmed. The entire point of gun ownership is to have a means of resistance against tyranny and those that would do great evil to you. You&#039;re on about the kid killing three home invaders. There is no possible way to gauge an intruders motives in that kids circumstances. He was outmanned and had he not had that rifle there&#039;s no telling what would have happened to him. There are plenty of people out there that would sooner kill you than leave a witness to the crime they just committed. Having access to arms not about what you know, it&#039;s about what you don&#039;t know. Okay, so Finland has great crime stats. That&#039;s not the reality here and taking arms will only make those stats go up. If a criminal knows everyone is unarmed, there&#039;s nothing stopping them if they have the upper hand. That 5&#039;0&quot; 100lb girl isn&#039;t going to stand much of a chance against a 6&#039;0&quot; 200lb rapist let alone a secret police force or firing squad without access to an adequate means of defense.","time":1491810628,"resto":120394023,"id":"6lLrgKY0","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120410782,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)03:51:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;253 replies and 35 images<\/span><br><br>Fuck you retards for feeding the trolls and the shittiest threads.

He went to Kew-Forest School, ditto. Its other notable alumni include Katherine Weber, Jewish, Gideon Yago, Jewish, and Hank Azaria, Jewish.

So they want you to think she is Scots. Then click on her father, Malcolm MacLeod. Then click on his mother, Anne MacLeod. She is the wife of Alexander MacLeod, so that is her married name. What is her maiden name? Whoops, it is also MacLeod, because her father is also named Alexander MacLeod. So both her father and her husband have the same first and last names? Did she marry her own father? Also, her birthyear is given as 1833. Note the 33.

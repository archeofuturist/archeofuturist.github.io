Neptune is the counterpart of Poseidon, who was the father of Atlas, the king of the lost world of Atlantis. I haven&#039;t read much about it but I know that Freemasons are very interested in the topic of Atlantis, and I&#039;ve heard that some want for America to be the &quot;New Atlantis&quot; as a part of the NWO. It would make a lot of sense because Atlantis was ultimately a corrupted, evil society ran by kikes. The half man half fish is a big figure in history. Also, I&#039;ve heard some people point out the connection between the three-pronged spear and the devil&#039;s pitchfork.","filename":"1479542649916","ext":".jpg","w":260,"h":285,"tn_w":114,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490119412193,"time":1490119412,"md5":"C4qAZQD6mpY2BE7UQEKcqQ==","fsize":16985,"resto":117636609,"id":"NXTG3IKV","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117652114,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)14:18:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117650507\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117650507<\/a><br>They&#039;re just results of their communications.","time":1490120305,"resto":117636609,"id":"GlRT515P","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117652589,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)14:22:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117638580\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117638580<\/a><br>And create a society of spineless jellyfish cucks that let minorities and women walk all over them?","time":1490120555,"resto":117636609,"id":"QZECSpLK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117652903,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)14:25:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117650507\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117650507<\/a><br>Yes - theres a good documeantary about the New Atlantis and Francis Bacon.

You&#039;d think us liberals would want to prove definitively that there are no differences by testing populations around the world to determine if there are racial differences in regard to IQ. It&#039;s the one thing that racists have proof of from questionable sources, but the liberals don&#039;t even want to discuss the possibility. In reality, it&#039;s completely reasonable to assume that different populations evolving separately for vast amounts of times in completely different habitats would have constant varying levels of required ingenuity to stay alive. Therefore, a racial difference in IQ is totally reasonable. I&#039;m liberal in that I don&#039;t think any race should overtly dominate or oppress any others out of some feeling of superiority, and liberals are afraid of just that if it&#039;s proven definitively from current respected sources that the average black person&#039;s IQ was considerably lower than the average white man&#039;s IQ as a rule. Knowing the truth, once again from current respected studies, would be awesome, but it would ultimately be used as a reason for atrocities against fellow humans. Knowing has no culturally or socially altruistic value, other than to satisfy curiosity. That knowledge would only be used for evil.","time":1490120022,"resto":117649569,"id":"iGRbC49a","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117652980,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)14:25:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117649569\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117649569<\/a><br>According to science or (((science)))?<br>Jews played a crucial role on the &quot;there is one race&quot; bs<br><br>See: http:\/\/archive.is\/E3RCx","filename":"1459994669484","ext":".png","w":2410,"h":1940,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":100,"tim":1490120759660,"time":1490120759,"md5":"wCwEdXP4haRLMYe5QP0SBA==","fsize":2354454,"resto":117649569,"id":"rwIXjf3l","country":"CL","m_img":1,"country_name":"Chile"}]},{"posts":[{"no":117651199,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)14:10:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"Do black commit more crime?

Looking at the Middle East, I watched as a missile flew from Libya and hit Israel. The mushroom cloud that resulted from the blast was visible, and I knew that the missile contained a nuclear bomb. I was aware that those responsible for the missile were Iranian, but the missile had been hidden and fired from within the borders of Libya.<br><br>Almost immediately after this, other missiles began flying from one country to another, quickly spreading war around the world. I also saw that many nuclear explosions did not come from missiles but from bombs of some kind on the ground.","time":1491591426,"resto":119946424,"id":"PDblgmKv","country":"MX","country_name":"Mexico"},{"no":120003017,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)14:57:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120002667\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120002667<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;conquer the entire world again<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;greeks claim it was them <\/span><br>theres no winning","time":1491591470,"resto":119946424,"id":"PbgnRg1A","country":"MK","country_name":"Macedonia"},{"no":120004117,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)15:04:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120002762\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120002762<\/a><br><a href=\"#p120002903\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120002903<\/a><br>if end times dreams interest you.. you should look for a testimony by a man named &quot;Benjamin Baruch,&quot; he claims God showed him the final days of the USA","time":1491591875,"resto":119946424,"id":"WxrKLf2h","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120004475,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)15:06:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119994557\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119994557<\/a><br><br>ok then.... but whats with germany?","time":1491592003,"resto":119946424,"id":"byOvUbIT","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":120005357,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)15:12:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"What would be considered a sort of &quot;safe zone&quot;?

Whites grew crops while Indians hunted. Only when Europeans tried to also claim hunting rights did the Indians become violent. <br><br>Today, Indians still cause problems- turns out that exclusion did not work. <br><br>We face a similar resource problem today, but with women instead of land. The difference is that while land can&#039;t choose who owns it, women can. <br><br>The problem is the sole claim of ownership towards women- just as in the 1700s, a peaceful existence only existed while resources were used by Europeans\/Indians simutaneously. Problems were few, asides from occasional disease transmission. <br><br>Considering White\/Black mental\/physical disparities, either Whites\/Blacks may be preferable to women, and at different times, even for different purposes. Considering White\/Black disparities, a woman may want a White man for certain purposes, and a Black man for other reasons. And considering women&#039;s differing ability to accomdate White\/Black performance in different roles, both White\/Black have roles to play for women. A peaceful existance is possible so land as resources are used for multiple roles.","filename":"bl","ext":".jpg","w":205,"h":246,"tn_w":205,"tn_h":246,"tim":1492578670624,"time":1492578670,"md5":"8zGw7W7U123ESnJdaRXY4Q==","fsize":6663,"resto":0,"id":"Mh4AUO8\/","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"whitesblacks-and-filling-resource-roles","country_name":"Canada","replies":31,"images":7,"omitted_posts":26,"omitted_images":6},{"no":121826022,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)05:35:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121806076\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121806076<\/a><br>Indians had crops and agriculture like corn and beans and pupkin, so all the basics of your point is stupid to begin with.","time":1492594521,"resto":121806076,"id":"+kSrmQ5f","country":"HU","country_name":"Hungary"},{"no":121826445,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)05:41:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121807315\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121807315<\/a><br>Yh that&#039;s all good then leaf, I&#039;ll have a share of your wife\/gf, sister, and any cousins I like the look of, in return I&#039;ll let you pay for my plane ticket out there, all my expenses, and if your good about it I might even let you stand outside the door and listen while I fuck them.<br>Day of the rake when?","time":1492594888,"resto":121806076,"id":"jO2ZGLQL","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121827258,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)05:52:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"you sorrt of have a point, as long as the only mixing is wm&gt;bf annd black mothers take care of the mixed kids.

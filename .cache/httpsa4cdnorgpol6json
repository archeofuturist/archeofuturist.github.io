All or nothing. There can not be one seed left, as Judaism has the shown ability to survive; their religion preaches it. Whatever society they touch, no matter the benefit, they are not loyal, they can not be trusted. They&#039;re manipulators: do not believe them, do not believe them to be human. No Jew is based, no Jew is safe - every one must be torn out from the roots so their vile poison may not poison of the European people.<br><br>The negro too, must be eliminated. Not for evil, as with the Jew, but for his idle nature. He&#039;s the puppy with big eyes in the window, who will steal resources, and only becomes a larger parasite whence it begins to breed. He is a failed branch of humanity, allowed to live by the kind, but for his own good, he must be wiped off the planet. <br><br>The muds, anyone mixed, must be eliminated. Some can be good, clearly the European shining through, but they&#039;re sullied. You do not allow a good cripple to breed, because despite how good one might be, there are a thousand more who will gut you, rob you, and take from you.<br><br>The Oriental, a great people, must to go. Should the white man thrive, survive, and continue towards the stars, we must do as our ancestors did, and eliminate competition. The face of humanity on the intergalactic scale can be a hue white, with fair features, reminiscent of the cosmos of which they gaze, or a mirror towards the abyss, as is the stained Oriental. <br><br>This can not be debated. Anyone who tries to be anything less than a fanatic in this race war is a traitor to tomorrow&#039;s white man, and a blasphemer against the ancestor.<br><br>You will swing from the rope on that fated day should you not heed this warning.","filename":"1399471409538","ext":".jpg","w":719,"h":480,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1491278714812,"time":1491278714,"md5":"VrOGeE8nQwXOreCaIDAu3w==","fsize":120175,"resto":0,"id":"14zbnK8C","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-jewish-people-must-be-exterminated-without","country_name":"United States","replies":6,"images":2,"omitted_posts":1,"omitted_images":0},{"no":119429648,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)00:17:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119428787\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119428787<\/a><br>You don&#039;t win them over - it&#039;s a realization.

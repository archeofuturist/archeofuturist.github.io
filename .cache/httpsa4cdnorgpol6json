I see the news and I truly feel disgusted and angry nowadays, because I know there is an agenda at work and it really pisses me off. I really wish people could understand the concept of billion dollar corporations pouring money into the system to make us brain dead robots. What makes it even more depressing is that you go on the internet and nobody seems to understand the concept of free speech anymore, and they cherish when a man loses their job for speaking their opinion, or when companies (even though it is their platform) up front reject certain opinions as hate speech and bans them. They call us fascist, when in reality its quite the opposite.","filename":"Capture","ext":".jpg","w":1055,"h":237,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":56,"tim":1490460786071,"time":1490460786,"md5":"Q1IjQOavE82Zt8+MEeSYgw==","fsize":63931,"resto":0,"id":"XiInG\/js","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"why-is-the-media-attempting-to-alienate-us","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":1},{"no":118244074,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)12:56:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118243710\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118243710<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I understand that Trump lost the vote<\/span>","filename":"1490448039864","ext":".jpg","w":1008,"h":1200,"tn_w":105,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490460988877,"time":1490460988,"md5":"TG6AJbxpH2EoGfDtCzAb0g==","fsize":180933,"resto":118243710,"id":"ORciAwR6","country":"GR","m_img":1,"country_name":"Greece"},{"no":118244159,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)12:57:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118244074\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118244074<\/a><br>I meant the healthcare vote.","time":1490461031,"resto":118243710,"id":"XiInG\/js","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118242741,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)12:44:04","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Helb Bleas","com":"Hello \/tv\/.

They are actively harassing and hurting American citizens and businesses, and the general public is growing tired of it. They spout violent rhetoric on their sites (you can find many on Facebook alone by searching for Antifa), and at every event they show up to they instigate violence against citizens exercising their first amendment right to free speech. They will also latch onto peaceful protests that they claim to support and cause violence through the smashing of public and private property, and strike anyone who intervenes. Local police have proven largely ineffective due either to orders from above barring them from intervening, or from general negligence. I urge you to officially label these groups as what they are, Domestic Terrorists. Because, by definition, it is what they are.

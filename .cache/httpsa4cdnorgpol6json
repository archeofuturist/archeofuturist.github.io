Such an admission of the obvious would not have been in any way remarkable were it not that socialists so frequently deny it, criticising liberal capitalist democracy because of its wastefulness and its inculcation of artificial desires in its citizens, thereby obscuring their \u2018true\u2019 interests. By stocking Department Store Number 1 with as many goods as they could find, in order to impress foreign visitors, the North Koreans admitted that material plenty was morally preferable to shortage, and that scarcity was not a sign of abstemious virtue; rather it was proof of economic inefficiency. Choice, even in small matters, gives meaning to life. However well fed, however comfortable modern man might be without it, he demands choice as a right, not because it is economically superior, but as an end in itself. By pretending to offer it, the North Koreans acknowledged as much; and in doing so, recognised that they were consciously committed to the denial of what everyone wants.<\/span>","time":1492396678,"resto":121401961,"id":"Xqz8O\/Vo","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":121466180,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)22:38:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121444045\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121444045<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121445056\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121445056<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121445354\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121445354<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121447905\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121447905<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121450521\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121450521<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121450842\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121450842<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121450896\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121450896<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121450935\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121450935<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121452393\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121452393<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121452496\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121452496<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121452891\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121452891<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121453042\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121453042<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121453149\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121453149<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121453349\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121453349<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121453467\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121453467<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121454208\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121454208<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121454352\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121454352<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121455972\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121455972<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121459069\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121459069<\/a><br>I have never before seen such extremely obvious shilling, holy shit<br><br>was this guy killed for failing to convince us?","time":1492396735,"resto":121401961,"id":"41C2Nrup","country":"NZ","country_name":"New Zealand"},{"no":121466326,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)22:40:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121405426\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121405426<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Libraries are huge, but empty, with decade old censored books in poor shape, mostly propaganda.<\/span><br> <br>Inner city library in America","time":1492396805,"resto":121401961,"id":"ebiaMUV8","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121466346,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)22:40:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121466060\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121466060<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;But the most sombre reflection occasioned by Department Store Number 1 is that concerning the nature of the power that can command thousands of citizens to take part in a huge and deceitful performance, not once but day after day, without any of the performers ever indicating by even the faintest sign that he is aware of its deceitfulness, though it is impossible that he should not be aware of it. One might almost ascribe a macabre and sadistic sense of humour to the power, insofar as the performance it commands bears the maximum dissimilarity to the real experience and conditions of life of the performers. It is as if the director of a leper colony commanded the enactment of a beauty contest \u2013 something one might expect to see in, say, a psychologically depraved surrealist film. But this is no joke, and the humiliation it visits upon the people who take part in it, far from being a drawback, is an essential benefit to the power; for slaves who must participate in their own enslavement by signalling to others the happiness of their condition are so humiliated that they are unlikely to rebel.<\/span><br><br><br>This is from a book called The Wilder Shores of Marx.

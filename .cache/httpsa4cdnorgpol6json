They are very easy to spot. They also tend to be anti \/r\/the_donald in order to cause a civil war among our fellow brothers and sisters who have managed to maintain a stronghold on Reddit. Most of \/r\/the_donald are \/pol\/ crossposters so any anti \/r\/the_donald post is an affront at \/pol\/, shills are capitalizing on 4chan&#039;s hatred of reddit to divide us.<br><br>2) Pro-Assad\/pro-Putin shills - any time you see a pro-Assad post there is a 80-85% chance you are speaking from a paid shill from the Kremlin. Studies show that most of the posters from \/sg\/ are from IPs that originate from Moscow, they have been part of \/pol\/ for a while now but lately the Russian government has increased their paychecks so you are seeing a lot more pro-Assad + pro-Putin propaganda posted on here. Be very wary. The remaining 15-20% are just misinformed posters who have fallen for Sputnik\/RT propaganda, so they can be redeemed.<br><br>Last point I want to make is that we are in very chaotic times, shills must understand that \/pol\/ will always stand by Donald J.Trump. No amount of concern trolling will EVER change this.","filename":"Screen-Shot-2016-05-26-at-1.21.42-PM","ext":".png","w":387,"h":469,"tn_w":206,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491625710351,"time":1491625710,"md5":"uGREGtKTlNWxY4P\/XiJnXA==","fsize":378414,"resto":0,"id":"HP5llGxn","country":"AU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"how-to-spot-shills","country_name":"Australia","replies":3,"images":1},{"no":120086265,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)00:31:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120085936\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120085936<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;newfag<\/span><br>Kys","time":1491625872,"resto":120085936,"id":"qd1AEl16","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120086609,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)00:34:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120086265\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120086265<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;newfag<\/span><br>Here we see a shill using words which he doesn&#039;t really understand in order to camouflage his anti-Trump shilling by acting as if he is an oldfag.

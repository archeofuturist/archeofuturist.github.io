Whether you like it or not, thousands upon thousands of years of genetic evolution decided to mutate women with group thinking mindsets. Like it or not, that can either be a boon....if emotions aren&#039;t involved, or a curse, if so. In most cases, curse. Voting was regulated to men because the perspective was: Women are emotional, generally naive, self centered and focus on generally trivialities that do not affect our society in the long run, men are the opposite of that and those that aren&#039;t fall by the wayside quickly, letting the &quot;strong destroy the weak&quot; method to play out.

Or they retire them entirely and increase output from the neighboring nuclear, hydro, natural gas, whatever. Hardly anyone rebuilds coal plants anymore.<br><br>So who&#039;s gonna buy the coal? How can you save something nobody wants? Natural gas is cheap, requires a smaller plant to produce power, and is easier to transport because you get more energy per square inch.<br><br>Coal is dead.

In a thread earlier today we discussed CNN&#039;s position as the default news station of most of the English speaking world and the obstinate position they have taken with regard to the Susan Rice scandal - with Don Lemon going so far as to say he considered it a distraction and would purposely ignore it. This coming from a news station that gleefully ran with the Trump Hires Russian Hookers to Piss in Obama&#039;s Bed claptrap 24 hours a day for a week.

I propose we bring this to an end. It&#039;s time to start complaining to the management about CNN. It&#039;s time to get the normies on your Zuckbook to complain about CNN. The first step is memes. This thread is for gathering all currently available memes showing the irresponsible reporting and outright lies propagated by CNN. This thread is also for the creation of new memes about CNN from the most recently available material. Once created we spread these memes. Once these start appearing on the Zuckbook feeds of angry Boomer normies we can hope to see the Boomers begin to do what they do best - which is complain. Over time, we need to have CNN turned off in as many public places as possible. Some well crafted memes posted to the local dentist or doctors office with a question as to why they still play CNN could work wonders.","filename":"170226132128-how-trump-turned-fake-news-into-a-slur-00021929-full-169","ext":".jpg","w":1600,"h":900,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1491359179514,"time":1491359179,"md5":"jYw6BxiS16c2IARAthO+lw==","fsize":208548,"resto":0,"id":"WEc64uTp","country":"CA","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"cnnmwg-cnn-meme-war-general","country_name":"Canada","replies":141,"images":65,"omitted_posts":136,"omitted_images":65,"tail_size":50},{"no":119569730,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)01:02:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a

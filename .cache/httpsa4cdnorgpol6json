Use cover crops, perennials, whatever. This will take up excess nitrogen if done right, and will always have organic matter being put into the soil via photosynthesis. <br><br>2) Always keep the soil covered. Again, perennials, or cover crop residue or crop residue, or whatever. This prevents erosion and stops the nitrogen from being washed off.<br><br>3) Minimize soil disturbance. No till is best, if you combine it with perennials or cover crops to control weeds, grow your own mulch, etc... There is a fuckload of complex biology that happens in healthy soil, and deep tilling fucks its shit up. It&#039;s like starting your house on fire to cook a hotdog.<br><br>4) Biodiversity. When you go to a healthy wildland, you do not see one species of plant growing. Different plants can have different effects on the soil. Legumes can add nitrogen. Rye can improve soil health and act as one helluva mulch in the spring. Sunflowers can help break up hardpan and attract pollinators. In the end, animals are also important to integrate into the system. Chickens and ducks can break pest cycles. Rotational grazing of cows and other grazers in a pattern similar to what happens in nature helps build soil. <br><br><br>If farmers would start adopting those practices, they could reduce, or eliminate the need for synthetic inputs while sucking CO2 out of the atmosphere and putting it into the ground to build healthy soils.

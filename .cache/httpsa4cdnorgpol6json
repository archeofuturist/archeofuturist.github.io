The Renaissance was hundreds of years before the Reformation and thoroughly promoted and extended by the Catholic Church. These are examples of intellectual flourishing in Christendom, which flies in the face of the belief that there was a shackling and a lack of free thought. What you&#039;re saying is just Enlightenment memes. The Enlightenment thinkers largely believed the Portestant anti-Catholic memes about how bad Christendom was (bullshit about the inquisition, dark ages, bruno, wycliffe, galileo, etc) and thought they were an escape to it, hence their focus on &quot;free thought&quot; and being &quot;new&quot; (modern, hence this being the rise of &quot;modernism&quot;). <br><br>Your understanding of history is rife with you buying propaganda.

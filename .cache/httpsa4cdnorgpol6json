When you are producing products of any kind, the MNC, or multi-national corporations, are looking for places where they can obtain the best price, but at the same time, the quality of education must be decent enough for the MNC to decide to invest there. What you dont grasp is the USA has plenty of decent workers to supply the demand of the MNCs without raising too much the value of their products. The other issue is the excessive taxation in the USA for companies who want to invest in the country. Also, if the companies start to come back, the government gets more money by taxing people than companies, so giving the MNCs tax breaks is ideal to promote investments.

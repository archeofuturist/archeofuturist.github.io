This general is for the discussion of Marxism-Leninism, the ideology of revolutionary socialism and communism.<br><br>Communism is the next stage of humanity following the capitalist stage.<br><br>What exactly is communism according to Marxist-Leninists:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Communism is a stage of society in which the productive infrastructure is socially owned, and goods are produced not in order to sell for profit, but in order to meet a social need.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Communism in it&#039;s full form is a stateless, classless society that follows the maxim &quot;From each according to their ability, to each according to their need.&quot;<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;To achieve such a society Marxism-Leninism teaches us that we must replace the capitalist state, which is controlled by the capitalist class, by a socialist state, which is controlled by the working class. Then, a period of class struggle follows in which the capitalist class is liquidated by the working class. When the capitalist class has been completely vanquished, there will be only one class, the working class, and eventually the functions of the state will become indistinguishable from the functions of the society as a whole, and the state as such will &#039;wither away&#039; as Marx said.<\/span><br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/ma<wbr>rx\/works\/1847\/11\/prin-com.htm<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/ma<wbr>rx\/works\/1848\/communist-manifesto\/<br><br>ML uses a philosophy called dialectical materialism, see here:<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/reference\/<wbr>archive\/stalin\/works\/1938\/09.htm<br><br>It is recommended that you read some of the critical works of Marxism-Leninism so you can make an informed assessment of the ideology.<br><br>Resources:<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/ma<wbr>rx\/works\/sw\/<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/le<wbr>nin\/works\/sw\/<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/reference\/<wbr>archive\/stalin\/works\/decades-index.<wbr>htm<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/reference\/<wbr>archive\/mao\/selected-works\/<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/ma<wbr>rx\/works\/1884\/origin-family\/<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/le<wbr>nin\/works\/1914\/mar\/11.htm","filename":"1480606481750","ext":".png","w":1010,"h":1010,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493509727434,"time":1493509727,"md5":"676S1nirnOI5InkeibSxFw==","fsize":177742,"resto":0,"id":"VE0RpqO\/","country":"NL","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"pol-communism-general","country_name":"Netherlands","replies":3,"images":2},{"no":123404255,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)20:05:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"Okay, so... hypothetically say your commie working class actually reaches a point where the gdp can sustain the entirety of the population.<br>What is the incentive to continue growth if everyone&#039;s physical needs are met?<br>Beyond that, what is the incentive to work at all in a state where you own nothing?","filename":"IMG_2934","ext":".jpg","w":620,"h":405,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":81,"tim":1493510730516,"time":1493510730,"md5":"diqbeT2zEhjr5scQp8QhWw==","fsize":40474,"resto":123401703,"id":"vtlZhvzD","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123405253,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)20:11:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123401703\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123401703<\/a><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;\/leftypol\/<br><br>\/pol\/ is a Phalangist board.","filename":"jewmeagain","ext":".jpg","w":305,"h":297,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":121,"tim":1493511118311,"time":1493511118,"md5":"Vk5G7Kv24Lk8lusCwD\/6JQ==","fsize":54057,"resto":123401703,"id":"O3DYEJP4","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123405417,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)20:12:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123401703\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123401703<\/a><br>Benis :DDDDDD","time":1493511176,"resto":123401703,"id":"Tz52OBLl","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":123399335,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)19:31:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"Just found out someone I live with is a communist... what do?<br><br>Video related (look at the wall): https:\/\/twitter.com\/politismall\/sta<wbr>tus\/858099502556860416","filename":"OccupyPhilly4","ext":".png","w":475,"h":637,"tn_w":186,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493508704200,"time":1493508704,"md5":"N04iJ8chZ5anYNPRr+F9qg==","fsize":720258,"resto":0,"id":"uA8\/HMAg","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"just-found-out-someone-i-live-with-is-a-communist","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":20,"images":5,"omitted_posts":15,"omitted_images":5},{"no":123403327,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)19:59:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123400512\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123400512<\/a><br><a href=\"#p123402359\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123402359<\/a><br>I don&#039;t want to risk my friendship with her or make living arrangements awkward... she doesnt know my views<br>Also it&#039;s a grill","time":1493510360,"resto":123399335,"id":"uA8\/HMAg","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123403388,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)19:59:40","name":"Anom","com":"<a href=\"#p123399335\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123399335<\/a><br>This https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=y3q<wbr>kf3bajd4 and this is why https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=5gn<wbr>pCqsXE8g&amp;t=18s","filename":"Antifa Communist","ext":".jpg","w":1366,"h":768,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1493510380912,"time":1493510380,"md5":"FJMUpgWSL14HaC+qjyfh4A==","fsize":154046,"resto":123399335,"id":"8wksUUYK","country":"PH","m_img":1,"country_name":"Philippines"},{"no":123403469,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)20:00:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123403327\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123403327<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;it&#039;s a grill<\/span><br>so?

Thieves only exist because they think they have legitimate claim to the stuff they steal; they fight for their treasures, because they don&#039;t recognize &quot;Alphas&quot;, except for family members.<br><br>How this relates to depression, is that depression, likewise, is a byproduct of a socially-repressed society. Depression is loneliness and unrequited validation. How can you be validated in a society that you don&#039;t validate? Modern civilization has the appearance of a &quot;society&quot;, but the validation that others give us is meaningless, because our bosses only pay us because they have to, and our wives only marry us and have our kids because they have to, and we have to pay taxes otherwise they will arrest us. We&#039;re given no room for genuine human-human socialization and validation. Without validation, we could be among millions of people yet feel so alone.","time":1493511037,"resto":123398398,"id":"XksVtcdI","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]},{"posts":[{"no":123399471,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)19:32:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"Social experiment made in a small provincial Polish town about attitude to muslims.<br><br>Enjoy!<br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=O4J<wbr>Yfjx8RKo","filename":"socexp","ext":".jpg","w":251,"h":201,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":200,"tim":1493508762024,"time":1493508762,"md5":"s+rt6a4SQ7+shGn13+3Eaw==","fsize":6175,"resto":0,"id":"ngv8ejdy","country":"PL","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"social-experiment-made-in-a-small-provincial","country_name":"Poland","replies":15,"images":1,"omitted_posts":10,"omitted_images":0},{"no":123402728,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)19:55:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123399471\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123399471<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;jews are the real enemy<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;random lady on the street<\/span><br>brb becoming a polish citizen","time":1493510140,"resto":123399471,"id":"+\/pqTaUa","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123403248,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)19:58:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123399471\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123399471<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Jews are far more dangerous<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;You are better off attacking Jews<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Jews are the real enemy of Poland<\/span><br><br>Oy vey.

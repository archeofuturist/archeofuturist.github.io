I think you have to go to the jungian level of what it is trying to build off of to get real meaning out of it. For me it helped because at the very least it gave me a good jumping off point for self improvement. No you might have the rebuttal of, &quot;well you could have done that with a real theory,&quot; but I don&#039;t think that particularly matters, as long as you have the goal of reading further than MB. For me, it led me to more of the robust jungian personality theories and if it has that end result, I don&#039;t see to much harm in it. I could see how it is detrimental if you just stop at MB, but if you dig deeper, it can be really helpful. For the most part, I&#039;ve seen most people of the NT types and NF types dig deeper into the theory, while the more normie types just kind of read it and move on. If you view MB in the context as a rigorous psychological theory, I think it fails, but if you view it as kind of a super dumbed down personality theory, that requires you to read more of the robust theories, I think it serves its purpose.","time":1490936588,"resto":119013189,"id":"CyiGhTCm","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119022912,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)01:03:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119013425\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119013425<\/a><br>this.<br><br>im INTP. but i understand that OCEAN is the proper personality test, or &quot;the big five&quot;","time":1490936626,"resto":119013189,"id":"R5DY7Bip","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119023036,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)01:05:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119022775\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119022775<\/a><br>mistake, my wife got INFJ which was 1% of the population","time":1490936727,"resto":119013189,"id":"5uga+VMR","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119023211,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)01:07:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119022811\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119022811<\/a><br>No problem cunt","time":1490936854,"resto":119013189,"id":"J1VzmhKN","country":"IT","country_name":"Italy"},{"no":119023370,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)01:09:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119013189\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119013189<\/a><br>En(f\/t)p here.

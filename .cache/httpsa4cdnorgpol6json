She came home after school one day all flustered and said that her crush would only date her if they had sex after dinner. Mind you she was 16 and this dude was 19 (got held back a few years), while I myself was 11.<br><br>She told me to put on a suit,light up some candles on the dinner table and microwave a spaghetti TV dinner. I didn&#039;t have a suit so I put on my dad&#039;s which was hilariously oversized,even if I was pretty big for my age and did as she asked. I love my sister so I didn&#039;t question much but when she wanted to practice kissing after eating I got a little nervous so I backed out a little. We ended up doing that thing the dogs did in Lady &amp; the Tramp which made it a little less awkward.<br><br>My sister had never had sex before, and obviously neither had I. She had no real formal sex education (bible belt) but had seen a porno flick after sneaking into the theater last year. I&#039;m guessing that&#039;s where her knowledge came from because she had some pretty detailed requests, asking me to take off her bra and rub her breast,and in turn she would take off my pants and poke my weiner. We went to her bedroom and she gently tied me to the frame with her bra and took off her underwear. I didn&#039;t know what was going on and I didn&#039;t have any real sexual attraction to my sister but I got a slight chubby and she got on top of me and slid it in her vagina. She told me that she&#039;d do all the work because I didn&#039;t know how and kinda started jumping up and down on my semi.This scared my penis a bit so it became flaccid and she was tired from all the movement so she kinda just laid on top of me with my penis in her for about thirty minutes before she told me to release. I thought she meant pee because I didn&#039;t know how to ejaculate yet so I peed inside her and then she cancelled her date because she thought sex was gross.But in all seriousness we can&#039;t let this guy get the nuclear codes","time":1490902777,"resto":118951161,"id":"4T3aNhu7","country":"BD","country_name":"Bangladesh"},{"no":118958372,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)15:42:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118951161\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118951161<\/a><br>Who is this infamous person known as Russia?","time":1490902966,"resto":118951161,"id":"\/Mer8qe0","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118958392,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)15:42:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118957668\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118957668<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;This attack comprises of fake news to manipulate opinion, elections server hacks to discourage participation and turnout, disinformation to mislead voters<\/span><br>This guy gets it!<br>Don&#039;t you wonder why CNN, MSNBC and NewYorkTimes all spreaded Fake News and lost their credibility?

It&#039;s message is that violence begets violence and is not specifically red or blue pilled. Instead it presents points from both sides. While it gives reasoning to why Edward Norton&#039;s character and others are Neo Nazis, it does not condone the violence they create or that the niggers create either. At the end it lets the viewer decide on what Edward Norton&#039;s character will do after the credits roll, whether he will learn to forgive and forget or revert back to being a Neo Nazi.","time":1493648677,"resto":123601255,"id":"LsSXgAaQ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123626069,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)10:24:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123622699\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123622699<\/a><br>I find it hard to find that credible when it is made abundantly clear that by giving away all that currency at the end they crash the economy and cause millions to starve\/die.

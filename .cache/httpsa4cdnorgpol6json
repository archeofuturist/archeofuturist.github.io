Another senate bill authored by the same pair of ambitious religious freedom fighters would allow people employed in any of Texas&#039;s 65 licensed occupations to refuse service to people if those folks violate their SHRB.<br><br>So, for example, private medical providers wouldn&#039;t really have to help trans patients if they assert that being transgender violates their SHRB; barbers wouldn&#039;t have to cut gay people&#039;s hair if they didn&#039;t feel like it; plumbers could let toilets overflow and electricians could keep people in the dark if they happened to religiously disagree with the customer&#039;s sexual orientation. And the bill would prohibit the state from disciplining them for any of this.<br><br>Other bills allow wedding-industry businesses, such as cake makers and florists, to refuse service to LGBT couples (HB 2876 by Rep. Scott Sanford), allow &quot;conscientious refusal&quot; of healthcare services of any kind based moral beliefs (HB 2878 by Sanford) and allow child welfare service providers to refuse to take in LGBT kids (SB 892\u2014also by Senator Perry).<br><br>None of these bills has made significant headway in the Lege, at least not yet. The so-called bathroom bill, SB 6, has passed in the Senate, but its future is far less certain in the house. A House substitute, HB 2899, is less restrictive than SB 6 and does not include provisions about requiring school districts and cities to enforce bathroom bills based on biological sex, but prohibits jurisdictions from passing trans-inclusive bathroom policies. Which, to the LGBT community, is not much better.","filename":"protests","ext":".jpg","w":745,"h":559,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1493253652100,"time":1493253652,"md5":"WUe20+E8dSZEYIQROa47HQ==","fsize":124520,"resto":0,"id":"d1Sf++8t","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"texas-attempts-to-pass-a-dozen-antigay-religious","country_name":"United States","replies":135,"images":12,"omitted_posts":130,"omitted_images":11,"tail_size":50},{"no":122987655,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)23:24:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122986888\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122986888<\/a><br><br>i&#039;m against treating children, and i think gender dysphoria should be treated like a medical issue whereas lack of it is no different than plastic surgery in my opinion<br><br>children might be going through a phase and should just be monitored, if the behaviour persists for years then i understand putting the child in therapy for an extended amount of time to keep track of the progression of the issue<br><br>i don&#039;t think children should be used as guinea pigs when we don&#039;t fully understand the disorder<br><br>adults can understand what they&#039;re doing and the weight of it, children can&#039;t","time":1493263465,"resto":122966755,"id":"AxToQLz1","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122987741,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)23:25:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122986567\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122986567<\/a><br>That isn&#039;t a problem with the religions anything can be used to justify government exercising horrible force withoutthe people resisting and even going along with it.<br><br>You have seen this happen before your very eyes throughout Africa central and South America the middle East all facing horrible violence at the behest of out of control governments serving their own profits.<br><br>Besides the two most immoral and destructive ideologies I can think of in order is Malthusianism and everything derived from marxism.<br>Malthusiansm is what had the big Europeanempires genocide and various&quot;population control&quot; policies such as the taxation again Ireland that caused the famine.

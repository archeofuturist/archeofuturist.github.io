If you share support of him publicly then expect people around you to dismiss him and mock you for backing him. Expect them to warn you he will tank the economy in government with Labour\/Greens, or that he will betray your vote by forming coalition with National. Expect them to make accusations of racism against Winston and against you regardless of your views on race. While Winston is beloved by many he is as polarizing as NZ politics gets. Winston is the only one with a consistent record on mass immigration, denouncing it every step of the way. Winston is the only MP who cares about the 29 dead men stuck in Pike River. For me the deaths of those hard working white men is merely representative of the overall decline of our nation. As long as they remain down there then the lives of each and everyone of us should be considered worthless to the government who prioritize foreign currency. National and Labour cannot be trusted. Bill English and Andrew Little are spineless cuckolds, frontmen for global interests. Paula Bennett, the deputy PM; a single mother parasite took advantage of our system popping out wogs and intends to throw us all under the bus while she advances the John Key agenda. Or Jacinda Ardern, the braindead wannabe-model who has failed to even reproduce children let alone provide anything of political value and offers nothing more than Helen Clark 2.0. I won&#039;t even begin on the Greens because anyone who is dumb enough to vote them deserves to live in the third world nation they aspire New Zealand to become. NZ First might not be perfect but they are all we have.","filename":"0e035555ae3fd8fee613f95d99a001d623276cc8bad45a3c915ebf0fde21568a","ext":".jpg","w":302,"h":302,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490610640809,"time":1490610640,"md5":"86eZSDmNMUVkBJyuqmO6XQ==","fsize":27502,"resto":118484707,"id":"NJLUpcYh","country":"NZ","country_name":"New Zealand"},{"no":118500460,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)06:53:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"alright guys Im going to sleep because I have to get up early tomorrow<br><br>14\/88 and have a blessed white night","time":1490612038,"resto":118484707,"id":"6Z+PUAhp","country":"NZ","country_name":"New Zealand"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118495434,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)05:46:47","name":"Anonymous","sub":"height","com":"Should the perfect society only allow tall people to be full citizens, \/pol\/?<br><br>Is being short a trait that should be removed from the genetic pool?","filename":"5","ext":".jpg","w":623,"h":602,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":241,"tim":1490608007048,"time":1490608007,"md5":"GtkujVnTz\/cgMCvnJwta3w==","fsize":332102,"resto":0,"id":"B3bps65q","country":"SE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"height","country_name":"Sweden","replies":9,"images":1,"omitted_posts":4,"omitted_images":1},{"no":118499817,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)06:45:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118496241\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118496241<\/a><br>Long hands are good better for grasping, they&#039;re evolutionarily superior","time":1490611545,"resto":118495434,"id":"TS4u+uxw","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118499906,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)06:46:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118495434\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118495434<\/a><br><br>From a (pre-)historical perspective short people can perform activities requiring greater and more flexible mobility that long people can&#039;t, so gtfo","time":1490611607,"resto":118495434,"id":"dnN5bQ4z","country":"BE","country_name":"Belgium"},{"no":118500092,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)06:48:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118495434\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118495434<\/a><br>I&#039;m tall and on the edge of running into the wilds and living with a tribe.<br>fuck citizenships, that&#039;s just another name for slavery<br>enjoy your taxes and law enforcements","time":1490611734,"resto":118495434,"id":"hSgbs4oj","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":118500327,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)06:52:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Appearance is what should matter in our euro centric societies<\/span><br><br>No.<br>Intelligence, good health and psychological stability.

This video by Storm Clouds Gathering is a good analysis of the geo-political background to the situation [1] https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=K20<wbr>fm2166WM<br><br>First, it is important to know the basic alliances. Countries that support the Syrian government are Russia, China, Iran<br>and Iraq. The anti-Assad axis (countries pushing for regime change in Syria) are: United States, France, UK, Germany, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Qatar, Turkey and Israel. An important reason for this geo-political conflict is control<br>of oil and gas resources in the region. In 2009 Qatar proposed a natural gas pipeline which would have passed through Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Syria, Turkey and into Europe [2]. However, Assad rejected this. Instead in 2011, he formed a pact with Iraq, Iran and Syria to run a pipeline eastward, cutting Qatar and Saudi Arabia out of the arrangement. This gives a strategic advantage to the Shia faction and the Sunnis resent this. It also gives Russia an economic advantage over the US in oil and gas trading.","filename":"ZionistsForTrump","ext":".png","w":1032,"h":263,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":63,"tim":1492829035697,"time":1492829035,"md5":"GZXIhwadaNVhrQ3mkRzv3Q==","fsize":107467,"resto":0,"id":"UWcF2bQY","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"world-war-iii-real-motives-behind-trumps-missile","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":10,"images":2,"omitted_posts":5,"omitted_images":0},{"no":122228060,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)23:11:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122227486\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122227486<\/a><br>Zionist interests and control of the middle east&#039;s natural resources are not the only reason for Trump&#039;s missile strike.

Vladimir Putin has begun preparing to release Russia from the grip of the Rothschild controlled central banks by trading in precious metals such as gold and the other BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) nations are on board with this [11].

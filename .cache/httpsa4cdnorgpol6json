Yakubu Yahya, a 17-year-old from Niger, went to Libya searching for his missing parents and was kidnapped in the Libyan city of Sabha while crossing the Saharan Desert. His kidnappers demanded $2,000 - an unimaginable figure to him - and he was beaten almost constantly until he managed to escape. Eventually, he found enough work in Libya to scrape together $400 - enough to pay a smuggler to get him to the coast and then get onto the smuggler&#039;s boat.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;So, whatever happened to his parents? If he is looking for his parents, what the hell does he do illegally crossing to Europe? Why did his parents leave him alone anyway?<\/span><br><br>2. Nuy Hassen, 16, left Eritrea when he was six and spent a decade traveling through Ethiopia, Sudan and the Sahara Desert. Along the way, his friends were killed by smugglers because they got sick and couldn&#039;t keep up. When he finally reached Libya, he was kidnapped and held for 7 months. He&#039;s so traumatized that no one can figure out his full story.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;sure thing... no one can figure out his story. I can. He isn&#039;t from Eritrea, he is a 35yr old from Niger, he made up a shitty story to get asylum.<\/span><br><br>3. Mohammed Abdullah, a 32-year-old from Equatorial Guinea, explained how smugglers demand payment through some of the world&#039;s best-known money transfer companies, often via Gulf countries. Along the way, nearly everyone the migrants encounter is corrupt - including the Libyan military boat that escorted them for an hour after they left the beach at Zuwara.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;oh no, everyone is corrupt! Better come to Europe to leach off the European taxpayer and make Europe the same shithole as Africa and the Middle East!

This is assuming the US military could easily win a short-lived war against Mexico to force the primary Mexican government to be subjugated. I don&#039;t think the US military would have any problem doing this, and then immediately turning around and whipping the Cartels like the ragtag fuckwads they are doesn&#039;t sound like a huge challenge.<br><br>I say legalize marijuana and hemp first because let&#039;s be honest, you can easily grow tons of it in Mexico and it would immediately be a cash crop, spurring investment into the region due to the recently increased levels of security and safety in the concept of Mexican agricultural investment.<br><br>They could keep their current organization of government, though many things would become redundant and therefore would be completely eliminated due to lack of need. Whether it would be broken down into many states is up for discussion, but the general concept of taking it and using their land to increase the overall federal budget via taxes sounds worthwhile due to long-term profits.<br><br>Not to mention, annexing Mexico would, in a relatively short time, bring up the general quality of life for all Mexicans and resolve the immigration crisis. They can just stay the fuck home and build an economy there. Also, a southern wall would get quite a bit cheaper due to the smaller Mexican border.<br><br>Also, why the fuck hasn&#039;t the Mexican government just asked the US to Annex them yet?

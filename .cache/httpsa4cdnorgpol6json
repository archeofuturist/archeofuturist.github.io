She noted also that she and her research team found long Neanderthal sequences. The high percentage suggests, she added, that the human had a Neanderthal in its family tree going back just four to six generations. The finding by the team provides strong evidence that humans and Neanderthals continued breeding in Europe, long after their initial co-mingling in the Middle East (after humans began migrating out of Africa.)<br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=No_<wbr>Id8H4dv8<br><br><br>https:\/\/phys.org\/news\/2015-05-analy<wbr>sis-bones-romania-evidence-human.ht<wbr>ml","filename":"DNA","ext":".jpg","w":1113,"h":679,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":76,"tim":1492009937133,"time":1492009937,"md5":"2UeniNQte7LpXzroKeK7Gw==","fsize":58385,"resto":120761827,"id":"vueaWZqN","country":"RO","m_img":1,"country_name":"Romania"},{"no":120765734,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)11:13:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120761827\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120761827<\/a><br><br>DNA from a man who lived 40,000 years ago in Romania reveals that up to 11 percent of his genome came from Neanderthals.<br><br>Because large segments of the individual\u2019s chromosomes are of Neanderthal origin, a Neanderthal was among the man\u2019s ancestors as recently as four generations back in his family tree, reports a study published in the latest issue of the journal Nature.<br><br>The finding reveals that some of the first members of our species who came to Europe interbred with the local Neanderthals.<br><br>\u201cSome Neanderthals clearly became incorporated in modern human societies,\u201d said P\u00e4\u00e4bo, director of the Department of Evolutionary Genetics at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology. \u201cIt is still unclear exactly how much of the complete Neanderthal genome exists today in people, but it seems to approach something like 40 percent.\u201d<br><br>\u201cBut, of course, the Neanderthals are clearly extinct in the sense that they do not exist as an independent, separate group since some 30,000 or 40,000 years.\u201d<br><br>https:\/\/www.seeker.com\/ancient-huma<wbr>n-with-10-percent-neanderthal-genes<wbr>-found-1769961373.html","time":1492009981,"resto":120761827,"id":"vueaWZqN","country":"RO","country_name":"Romania"},{"no":120766218,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)11:17:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120761827\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120761827<\/a><br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=TNM<wbr>65ucSAgo<br><br>They genetic evidence leads to Swiss Alps as well.

The findings also show how one type of human could take an evolutionary shortcut and inherit an advantageous gene from another group through \u201cintrogression,\u201d or interbreeding, rather than spend tens of thousands of years evolving a way to adapt to a new habitat themselves. Today, though, these fatty acids are also implicated in diseases that are part of the so-called \u201cmetabolic syndrome\u201d\u2014obesity, diabetes (through the metabolism of sugars), high blood

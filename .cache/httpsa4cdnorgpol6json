and the Israeli government on Monday by denying the French state&#039;s responsibility for a mass arrest of Jews in Paris during World War Two.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Two weeks before the first round of the election in which she is a frontrunner, Le Pen touched a raw nerve by reopening debate about the state&#039;s role in one of the darkest episodes in French history under the Nazi occupation.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;I think France isn&#039;t responsible for the Vel d&#039;Hiv,&quot; Le Pen said on Sunday, referring to the German-ordered roundup by French police of 13,000 Jews in July 1942.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Most were crammed into the Velodrome d&#039;Hiver cycling stadium, commonly known as the Vel d&#039;Hiv, before being deported to the Auschwitz concentration camp.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;I think that, in general, if there are people responsible, it is those who were in power at the time. It is not France,&quot; Le Pen said in an interview with media groups Le Figaro, RTL and LCI.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Le Pen&#039;s rivals pounced on her comments, which could set back her attempts to clean up the image of her anti-immigration National Front and distance it from the anti-Semitic views of her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, the party&#039;s founder.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;Some people had forgotten that Marine Le Pen is the daughter of Jean-Marie Le Pen. They haven&#039;t changed,&quot; centrist presidential candidate Emmanuel Macron told BFM television.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The Israeli foreign ministry said it regretted that anti-Semitism &quot;is raising its head again today&quot;.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;This contradicts the historical truth as expressed in statements by French presidents who recognized the country\u2019s responsibility for the fate of the French Jews who perished in the Holocaust,&quot; a ministry spokesman said.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;Vel d&#039;Hiv&quot; was the top trending topic on Twitter in France on Monday, the first official day of campaigning for the election, whose first round is on April 23.<\/span><br><br>https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/frances-<wbr>le-pen-touches-nerve-wartime-jewish<wbr>-arrests-091208893--business.html","filename":"2017-04-10T173256Z_1_LYNXMPED3918U-OCATP_RTROPTP_2_CNEWS-US-FRANCE-ELECTION-LE-P","ext":".jpg","w":450,"h":300,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1491897945958,"time":1491897945,"md5":"ZqFWyv2DvIkuxOAjJ96NYw==","fsize":19129,"resto":0,"id":"My8lKtrV","country":"RS","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"frances-le-pen-evoking-wartime-jewish-arrests","country_name":"Serbia","replies":25,"images":5,"omitted_posts":20,"omitted_images":5},{"no":120574950,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)04:43:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120574457\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120574457<\/a><br><br>The problem is we&#039;re apathetic nowadays.

The domino effect would be catastrophically effective. <br><br>The Serbs, as well as most of the Eastern European population, are indeed motivated by spite, and will go out only and only if the knife already touches the bone.

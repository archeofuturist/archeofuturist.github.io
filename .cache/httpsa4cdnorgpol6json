I had a take home final for some technological anthropology course and one of the questions asked for me to talk about how women have it so hard in education in the 21st century.<br><br>Before I get into it, WHY THE EVERLIVING FUCK are we talking about women education. What the hell does that have to do with Technological Anthropology.<br><br>I swear to god colleges are trying to stick feminist bullshit into anywhere they can. I am a computer science major. Trying my best to avoid this crap but it still shows up.<br><br>Either way, I feel like garbage for not going on a rant about this question and probably getting a shit grade. <br><br>Why the hell do women care so much about STEM fields. I seriously had to write bullshit about how we aren&#039;t encouraging women enough in sciences and that they don&#039;t have the confidence they need to attempt to go into STEM fields. Had to talk about the bullshit wage gap which has been beaten into the ground as wrong. Women in CS get whatever the fuck they want. COMPANIES LOVE THEM. Who wouldn&#039;t want the fucking unicorn working for them.

Sorry atheists but atheism is not on the rise nor is it winning. It&#039;s still the minority and a declining one at that. <br><br>The Pew Research Center&#039;s statistics show that atheism is expected to continue to decline all the way into 2050 with a continued growth of religion. Other research also shows a huge surge in growth for Christianity in China which is currently the world&#039;s most &quot;atheist&quot; nation because of the atheist communist government suppressing religion, the research suggests that China will soon become the world&#039;s most Christian nation within 15 years. <br><br>This is simply history repeating itself: Christianity prospered in Rome back in the ancient era when it was suppressed and it still grew in the militant atheist soviet Russia when it was suppressed there only a century ago with the majority of Russians today now also identifying as Christian.

However, whether the the market bubble inevitably pops, automation reaches the point of the majority of millennials being unemployed or people get fed up enough with the ((status quo)), what would happen if the majority of indebted students just all stopped paying their student loans? There really is nothing stopping it from happening. If 20% of students did it, it wouldn&#039;t really be effective as they&#039;d just have their assets seized and the train would keep chugging along.

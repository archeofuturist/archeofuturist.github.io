As much as i would LOVE to see her behind bars, it simply isn&#039;t something that will happen in America, yet. It would set a precedent first of all. No matter how obviously guilty she is, the United States likes to look above the likes of third world countries. It is a third world dictatorship type activity to jail your electoral opponent. The case against her has sadly also been made political, where people who know nothing whatsoever about the case have visceral emotional stances on it depending on who they listen to. Liberals who know nothing about the case will defend her despite the evidence until the sun dies, just like liberals still say that &quot;hands up, dont shoot&quot; bull despite all evidence. And right wingers who have no clue about the case are the opposite. <br><br>Then take into account the power of the Clinton machine. The clintons have been doing shady, illegal crap for decades and have always gotten away with it. There is even tenuous reason to believe people have died directly from them (not counting Benghazi). Then consider who it is that investigates, who put them into power, and who are the Clinton&#039;s friends. Despite Bill Clinton and Obama being out of office, the judicial branch is still heavily influenced by their picks and hires. Then consider that the past two republican presidents were partly leftist cucks and who are we expecting to try the clintons?<br><br>Slso, when all of Washington is doing shady crap like the clintons, none of them want it to come to light. The best way i can think of explaining it is metaphorically. DC is a big shadowy swamp to use Trumps imagery. You shine a light on one corner of the swamp and other parts get illuminated by refractory light (sorry for the imagery lol). The swamp would rather the people stay busy with blood and bread than see any of it.","time":1490669741,"resto":118599039,"id":"KDvMV3jU","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118574924,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)18:54:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"Post ITT the demographics of your local area.<br><br>Bartholomew County IN<br>Population: 81,402<br>White: 89.7%<br>Black: 2.3%<br>Native American: 0.5%<br>Asian: 5.8%<br>Hispanic: 6.3%","filename":"IMG_0297","ext":".jpg","w":750,"h":753,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490655288401,"time":1490655288,"md5":"Ae7CvJ9Y+Ekchaf+WtuU+Q==","fsize":66663,"resto":0,"id":"4m3Z+YAv","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"post-itt-the-demographics-of-your-local-area","country_name":"United States","replies":298,"images":75,"omitted_posts":293,"omitted_images":74,"tail_size":50},{"no":118601119,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)22:50:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118600810\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118600810<\/a><br><br><a href=\"#p118600937\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118600937<\/a><br>Let it secede and then watch as it burns.

(Said underdog is simply a distant family member who doesn&#039;t have any connections to us - fill said role of underdog. Get them emotionally attached then cut the draw bridges and let the underdog win. People will be so enthralled that they lose their revolutionary spirit even if things stay the same. It&#039;s the same thing with the Arab &quot;migrants&quot;, bring a few in them introduce the underdog to make it to away, and because their candidate won any legitimate people coming out with voters fraud leaks wil just be labeled an angry leftist. They will also have the people on the leftist media purposefully do a poor job acting on television saying that the votes where rigged in favour of trump (they were) but as I said It delegitimizes any real leakers, and that guy Seth rich?, he&#039;s just a guy who was offered an extremely high amount of money to play as a &quot;leaker&quot; and move to Israel with a new identity.

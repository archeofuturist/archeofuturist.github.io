Why is big pharma allowed to advertise on TV and elsewhere in the US? When you hear they charge $175 for one aspirin while an impatient this is one example. The health insurance profit margin is actually very low. Health care providers and especially big pharma&#039; profit margin is extremely high. Nobody working to solve this problem.","time":1493917817,"resto":124068014,"id":"FQODDbi6","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":124081241,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)13:10:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"Kekistan official flag?","filename":"Kekistan_Tilted","ext":".png","w":5000,"h":3000,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":150,"tim":1493917815477,"time":1493917815,"md5":"9crIJ5ET74raS\/VjNPVPtg==","fsize":400695,"resto":0,"id":"Z6cH04ee","country":"MX","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"kekistan-official-flag","country_name":"Mexico","replies":1,"images":0},{"no":124081482,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)13:12:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124081241\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124081241<\/a><br>more like r\/the_donald official flag","time":1493917947,"resto":124081241,"id":"rFnKYqfY","country":"CL","country_name":"Chile"}]},{"posts":[{"no":124075331,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)12:14:27","name":"Anonymous","sub":"France, the biggest Nation.","com":"France is undoubtedly the country of war, my friends<br><br>There were 53 major conflicts in Europe. France will have been a belligerent in 49 of them, and the United Kingdom in 43.<br>Of the 185 battles France has fought over the past 800 years, its armies will have won 132 of them, and will have lost 43, leaving only 10 undecided battles. This does not take into account the battles before the year 1200 and there have been many! France thus holds the record of battles, wars and coalitions against it throughout the history of mankind.<br><br>- Over the last 800 years France has beaten over 200 years against England, over 150 years against the Germanic nations, more than 190 years against the Spaniards \/ Portuguese, and facing many other nations.<br><br>Often these wars were waged against France in numerical inferiority against coalitions of several nations aimed at destroying it. The most striking example is that of the Battle of Bouvines (1214). France is fighting alone for its survival against the immense Holy Roman Empire, England and the Flemish countries.<br><br>Vive la France.","filename":"1493509948-img-20170430-015003","ext":".jpg","w":1564,"h":1564,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493914467609,"time":1493914467,"md5":"pBh1\/UtloHDj9qsjGFzItg==","fsize":1843810,"resto":0,"id":"ARc2kYaZ","country":"FR","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"france-the-biggest-nation","country_name":"France","replies":22,"images":11,"omitted_posts":17,"omitted_images":10},{"no":124080697,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)13:05:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124080213\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124080213<\/a>","filename":"Paris metro","ext":".webm","w":640,"h":360,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1493917520994,"time":1493917520,"md5":"6PmtsPttGhCYoHmrSeAgGQ==","fsize":1929386,"resto":124075331,"id":"I1vwt2KB","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":124080854,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)13:06:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124075331\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124075331<\/a><br>I too like to reminisce about when my country was great.","filename":"1462836737808","ext":".jpg","w":800,"h":1016,"tn_w":98,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493917597763,"time":1493917597,"md5":"MVfnc9jeHZfCi2fzhTVRZQ==","fsize":730457,"resto":124075331,"id":"RDKZy34S","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124081051,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)13:08:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124080046\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124080046<\/a><br>oh my","filename":"abdd746e6f0441998e5537c4ac4527f9","ext":".png","w":284,"h":269,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":118,"tim":1493917714098,"time":1493917714,"md5":"ceFT9m1KO7rxOjhl3pF45A==","fsize":149505,"resto":124075331,"id":"ZrqYhCM5","country":"PT","country_name":"Portugal"},{"no":124081113,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)13:09:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124080250\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124080250<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;war <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;lifting<\/span><br><br>War is not about being the biggest strongest anymore you fucking Chad","filename":"1391097225396","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":500,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493917747761,"time":1493917747,"md5":"6ndnlxP\/+dnvsvh7WZbRrw==","fsize":113553,"resto":124075331,"id":"uMQknhQB","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":124081232,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)13:10:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124080046\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124080046<\/a><br>This","time":1493917810,"resto":124075331,"id":"gGbcvAVf","country":"PT","country_name":"Portugal"}]},{"posts":[{"no":124079305,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)12:52:23","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Jesus would be ashamed","filename":"18222369_417474911970634_8385602414746571787_n.png","ext":".jpg","w":800,"h":800,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493916743871,"time":1493916743,"md5":"hIUDuHiC80C6GgMRWyRBoQ==","fsize":46881,"resto":0,"id":"NtusBVdO","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"jesus-would-be-ashamed","country_name":"United States","replies":5,"images":1},{"no":124079665,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)12:55:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124079305\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124079305<\/a>","filename":"1493809884572","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":558,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":108,"tim":1493916955910,"time":1493916955,"md5":"UAHc\/gIx1uh1Cd49f1AhAg==","fsize":47061,"resto":124079305,"id":"rDIG5Pc5","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124079766,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)12:56:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124079305\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124079305<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Not handing over your money is murder!<\/span><br>Jews.","time":1493917013,"resto":124079305,"id":"SuhFDktf","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124079936,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)12:58:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124079305\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124079305<\/a><br><br>why don&#039;t these people ever feel bad about how misleading they are in their words","time":1493917106,"resto":124079305,"id":"3jhrRt3M","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124080027,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)12:59:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124079305\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124079305<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;muh 4% with pre existing conditions<\/span><br>you realize your shitposts only work on people who are as uneducated about the bill as you are?","time":1493917146,"resto":124079305,"id":"nxBxrcHs","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124081229,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)13:10:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124080027\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124080027<\/a><br>4% of the US population is almost 13 million people anon.","time":1493917807,"resto":124079305,"id":"GAtG584U","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":124059191,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)09:20:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"Why doesn&#039;t the white nationalist movement understand PR?

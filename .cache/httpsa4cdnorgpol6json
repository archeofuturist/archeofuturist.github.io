It has been working fine so far. Some countries were scared, they elected neo-nazis, or left the union.<br><br>However Turkey also damaged itself by implementing some hippy EU laws. Especially the anti-terrorism laws of EU are a total disgrace. Very Important for EU to understand by now that you can&#039;t confornt or defeat the terrorist in their territory with strict adherence to these hippy regulations and western rule of war . The most likely approach in defeating hardened and brutal terrorists is by leashing out close the same brutality that the terrorists unleash on their innocent citizens .

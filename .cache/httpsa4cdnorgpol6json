I&#039;ve heard story of people with depression and OCD recovering by taking it. The theory is that many mental disorders happen because the brain is wired wrong, like there&#039;s a specific way that your neurons are linked together and people with these disorders just have wrong and rigid links in their brains which wire them to follow a specific behavior pattern and thought process which is really hard to break. LSD could forcefully break these links open and forge new ones, which gives the chance for patient to develop new, healthier links.<br><br>I&#039;m not sure about this, I&#039;m no neuroscientist and I can easily see how this can be exploited. But it does sound logical enough. However, there&#039;s no guarantee that the new link would be better so it&#039;s still left to chance. And surely there are people who don&#039;t have very good experience with psychedelic drugs.","time":1493501878,"resto":123359867,"id":"fh9kSSLA","country":"VN","country_name":"Vietnam"},{"no":123385337,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)17:38:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123377226\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123377226<\/a><br>I used to be the same but then I eventually grew detached to other people.

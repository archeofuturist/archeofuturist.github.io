CI is not an organized religion; instead, it is independently practiced by individuals, churches and some prison gangs.[2] Its theology[3][4] promotes a racial interpretation of Christianity. Christian Identity beliefs were primarily developed and promoted by two authors who regarded Europeans as the &quot;chosen people&quot; and Jews as the cursed offspring of Cain, the &quot;serpent hybrid&quot; or serpent seed (a belief known as the two-seedline doctrine). White supremacist sects and gangs later adopted many of these teachings.<br>Christian Identity dictates that all non-whites (people not of wholly European descent) on the planet will either be exterminated or enslaved in order to serve the White race in the new Heavenly Kingdom on Earth under the reign of Jesus Christ. CI doctrine states that non-whites can never achieve salvation or paradise, instead it states that only &quot;Adamic&quot; (white people) can achieve salvation and paradise.<br>Adherents of Christian Identity refer to non-whites as &quot;mamzers&quot; or &quot;tares&quot;.","filename":"Dead_2f541c_303645","ext":".jpg","w":445,"h":290,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":81,"tim":1492428623205,"time":1492428623,"md5":"0X8B+OPmsQnTR00qEgZ9zw==","fsize":36308,"resto":121506447,"id":"zCZ2czBs","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121515493,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)07:34:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121506447\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121506447<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;create a white race of devils through genetic manipulation<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;white race of devils goes on to take over the world and oppress the fuck out of your people<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;everything went according to plan<\/span><br><br>Also, do read the wikipedia article, it&#039;s a fucking laugh.","time":1492428879,"resto":121506447,"id":"F0gKYZNF","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":121515577,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)07:35:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121506447\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121506447<\/a><br>Which rpg is this?","time":1492428943,"resto":121506447,"id":"QW95rLmu","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121515991,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)07:41:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121514948\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121514948<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121514656\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121514656<\/a>","filename":"tf1b-dwdtlor","ext":".jpg","w":1149,"h":804,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":87,"tim":1492429263404,"time":1492429263,"md5":"l+6Yu+emPXYcCD4T+76dJA==","fsize":420535,"resto":121506447,"id":"fNtBD2cg","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":121501480,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)04:29:09","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Russia Hate thread","com":"How long until Russia collapses? <br>Some analysts are saying if the oil price remains at the current level by 2021 there will be serious internal disorder <br><br>One good thing Obama did was his shale gas expansion, sandniggers are forced to keep prices low to compete.

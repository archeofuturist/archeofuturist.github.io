I think this might be mentioned in the very good documentary, &quot;The Smartest Guys in the Room.&quot; (On that note, it&#039;s very relevant because Ken Lay of Enron is behind part of the global warming hoax used to set up world government per your OP question; also there&#039;s a great scene in there that really shows what it&#039;s like when you get in to criminality and make fun of the people who fall for it -- been there done that -- good lesson.)<br><br>There&#039;s another documentary I watched one morning and I forget the name but you can probably find it if you search on the phrase, &quot;the fish rots from the head down.&quot; It&#039;s about the nature of psychopathy in corporate structures. Not the slickest thing I&#039;ve ever seen, but good enough that I tried to remember to donate to it and then forgot.","time":1490328654,"resto":118033835,"id":"PSoKQSmI","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118038429,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)00:11:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118033835\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118033835<\/a><br><br>Most of it doesn&#039;t exist.","time":1490328712,"resto":118033835,"id":"wi8LOtXR","country":"CH","country_name":"Switzerland"},{"no":118038566,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)00:12:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"Christ is the final and ultimate redpill on the jews.","time":1490328769,"resto":118033835,"id":"F6qRco1E","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118038244,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)00:10:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"How many of you are a republican while everyone else in your house a liberals?

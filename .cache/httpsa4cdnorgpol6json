Japan\u2019s crime and drug-use rates are famously low. Life expectancy is famously high. Japanese students put their American peers to shame on international tests. The unemployment rate clocks in at 3.1%. All this is supposed to be a function of a homogenous society with a high degree of cultural cohesion\u2014the antithesis of cacophonous, multiethnic America.<br><br>Japan\u2019s population shrank by nearly a million between 2010 and 2015, the first absolute decline since census-taking began in the 1920s. On current trend the population will fall to 97 million by the middle of the century. Barely 10% of Japanese will be children. The rest of the population will divide almost evenly between working-age adults and the elderly.<br><br>But whatever their other benefits, \u201cpro-family\u201d policies won\u2019t reverse the demographic trend. Only large-scale immigration can do that, and the Japanese won\u2019t countenance it. The flip side of cohesion is exclusion. The consequence of exclusion is decline.<br><br>Without immigration, our demographic destiny would become Japanese. But our culture wouldn\u2019t, leaving us with the worst of both worlds: economic stagnation without social stability. Multiethnic America would tear itself to pieces fighting over redistribution rights to the shrinking national pie.<br><br>Every virtue has its defect and vice versa. The Japanese are in the process of discovering that the social values that once helped launch their development\u2014loyalty, self-sacrifice, harmony\u2014now inhibit it. Americans may need reminding that the culture of openness about which conservatives so often complain is our abiding strength. Openness to different ideas, foreign goods and new people. And their babies\u2014who, whatever else Mr. King might think, are also made in God\u2019s image.<br><br>https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/other-<wbr>peoples-babies-1490050955","filename":"Untitled","ext":".jpg","w":864,"h":658,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":190,"tim":1490097105915,"time":1490097105,"md5":"Jof9tm+TQrDt7rh\/vxGMMA==","fsize":127836,"resto":0,"id":"iKW5DCNI","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"wsj-we-must-not-go-the-way-of-japan","country_name":"United States","replies":232,"images":50,"omitted_posts":227,"omitted_images":48,"tail_size":50},{"no":117630807,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)10:50:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117629949\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117629949<\/a><br>Please stop this meme.

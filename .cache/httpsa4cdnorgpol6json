Traditionalists who seek to preserve a the natural rights of man are always on the defense. It&#039;s hard, and almost impossible, to defend a flawed system, especially against visions of a utopian society it&#039;s critics promise. No system is perfect, and those who push globalization\/communism know this. Even with the clear historical records of the atrocities permitted and conducted under authoritarian regimes, the push for less freedom continues to push forward. Every history professor, political scholar, and college dropout talks of the threat of neoNazis and kkk threatening world peace, while ignoring the 800 lb gorilla in the room, communism. For now the push is for the socialist dream, but we know government power is logarithmic, it&#039;s never satisfied, and socialism will devolve into the communist Utopia. We need to counter the messages\/propaganda that&#039;s pushed from almost every direction.

The prosecutor&#039;s statements were the following:<br><br>1. Sokolovsky&#039;s goal was to form a negative opinion about women and believers.<br>2. Statements he made contain not only negation (of religion), but also negative (information about it).<br>3. The video was provoking the believers to protect their beliefs.<br>4. The information in the video &quot;Block, your own anus, Roskomnadzor!&quot;, shows how (disrespectfully) Sokolovsky feeling about the state, the President, citizens.<br>4 The expression of disrespect to the state is unacceptable. If a person does not like it (the state), he can leave (the country), but Sokolovsky does not do this, he just expresses a negative attitude, not offering anything (positive).<br><br>For these crimes state prosecution requested 3.5 years in a labor colony for Sokolovsky.","filename":"108faf57-6873-40ac-9cd1-704909fd7674[1]","ext":".jpg","w":720,"h":480,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1493376445731,"time":1493376445,"md5":"\/N6Ljqcpr8NAYVjaAMfu8g==","fsize":62436,"resto":0,"id":"XZDKU0Yy","country":"RU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"putins-state-destroys-sjw-snowflakes-once-again","country_name":"Russian Federation","replies":137,"images":24,"omitted_posts":132,"omitted_images":24,"tail_size":50},{"no":123198905,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)10:18:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123180440\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123180440<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Pokemon go<\/span><br><br>what the fuck, all that bullshit just because the guy was making sure to catch&#039;em all","time":1493389136,"resto":123180440,"id":"h7jeGYK2","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123198907,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)10:18:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123180440\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123180440<\/a><br>Religion is for faggots<br>Blind obedience to the state is for faggots<br>OP is a faggot","time":1493389136,"resto":123180440,"id":"ffrvbR\/0","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123199394,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)10:23:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123198826\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123198826<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;paid libshill.<\/span><br>I&#039;m not paid.

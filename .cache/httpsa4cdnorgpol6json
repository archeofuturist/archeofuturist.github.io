I&#039;ve read the Podesta email transcripts and CLEARLY, he is speaking in a code, he quoted something &quot;playing dominoes on the pizza or the pasta&quot; which was quite obvious he is using normal words as a code for something else, because by itself, the statements do NOT make any sense. <br><br>It seems to me, that Alex Jones is terrified of lawsuit OR possibly even his own life at stake.

Our enemies have uprooted every pillar of society. Nothing is sacred, anymore. Not marriage, not academia, not work, not masculinity. It has all been smothered by the black tar of modernity. There is little vitality in men, nowadays. Something is draining every one of us, whether it be work, pornography, video games... anything to distract us from the harsh reality that there is little courage to be found in our hearts. <br><br>Where is the honor? The valor? The strength? People are so, so lost in these dark times. I don&#039;t even recognize people anymore. Most people are some type of abhorrent abomination, whether they be grotesquely out of shape or lacking any sort of definitive sexual characteristics or hunched over and timid looking. These are not human beings. This is not a society. This is something gone terribly wrong. <br><br>Everything is about money. Most would sell their soul for fifteen minutes of fame. This is not a real world I am living in. There are no people. Only systems and consumers. There is no grand story to be part of, no nations left to defend, because the enemy is within, and his grip on the minds of the masses is absolute. <br><br>I see no other option except to embrace chaos in whatever form it takes.

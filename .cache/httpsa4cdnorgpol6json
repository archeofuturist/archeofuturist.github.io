That way you won&#039;t have to deal with feminism, which my people invented to destroy your people.<\/span>","filename":"just-married","ext":".jpg","w":1500,"h":1000,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1492304936323,"time":1492304936,"md5":"GoWYfJlzioh4VZlgYM6kQg==","fsize":235976,"resto":0,"id":"lx3TCmo2","country":"CA","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"marriage","country_name":"Canada","replies":57,"images":8,"omitted_posts":52,"omitted_images":8},{"no":121301407,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)22:20:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"is this cuck propaganda from canadia?<br><br>fucking figures you worthless piles of high snowy cum covered hilly ass shit<br>polygamy is how women are empowered to not listen to men all the time and figure shit out on their own... while still being able to procreate<br><br>how rich does one have to be to have polygamist wives?

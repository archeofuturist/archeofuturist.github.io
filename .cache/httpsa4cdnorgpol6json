The jews thought he was a false messiah. He fulfilled the prophecies, but over time the jews veered away from the old testament, and began heavily relying on the traditions of the elders, the talmud and writings similar. The jews actually understood the prophecies pretty well, but messed up in certain circumstances. They saw that in some prophecies, that the messiah would suffer, and at other times, would be glorified. They took from this that there would be two messiahs. One would be the messiah of israel, and the other the messiah of judah. The messiah of israel would suffer and die, while the messiah of judah would conquer the world and bring in everlasting peace and the fullest extant israel was promsed to the jews.

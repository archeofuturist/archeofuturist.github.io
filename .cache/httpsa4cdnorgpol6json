The main issue is the voting patterns of these non natives is nothing like the voting patterns of the natives reflecting the difference of their values. It has nothing to do with making sure it&#039;s an even split, you formed that idea on your own for some reason.

I&#039;ll repeat again though, their voting preferences should be similar to that of the native population, not an even split. If the native citizens voted to 70\/30 then the non natives should have voted in a similar proportion not 50\/50. <br><br>If they voted at 50\/50 while the native population voted at 70\/30 then it is clear that as a whole the government is not accepting immigrants who&#039;s views match the native population of the country and committing a disservice against the people who elected them. It isnt necessarily the fault of the people integrating them either, it could simply be the fault of the people choosing who we should try to integrate, not everyone can. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;And all I&#039;m trying to do at at the end there is point out that you&#039;re not using that term in the right way all the time.<\/span><br>Trying to be sarcastic or sneaky about insults instead of addressing the argument is an ad hominem. <br><br>I have to leave quickly now but feel free to leave a response and somewhat might pick up where I left off","time":1490998470,"resto":119097744,"id":"2yBvJ\/AF","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119108171,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)18:24:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119107160\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119107160<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;their voting preferences should be similar to that of the native population, not an even split.<\/span><br>Then you aren&#039;t talking about a sharing in American values at all.

Voting preferences don&#039;t have to necessarily closely resemble the native population.

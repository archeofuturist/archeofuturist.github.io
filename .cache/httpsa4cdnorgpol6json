The Daily Beast&#039;s recap of prepared remarks delivered by Sessions yesterday make him sound like a racist Bane cosplay enthusiast who learned everything he knows about messaging from studying one-dimensional movie villains:<br>\u201cThis is a new era,\u201d said Sessions, who sported a dark suit in the hot Arizona sun. \u201cThis is the Trump era.\u201d<br>Sessions made the announcement over a glitchy sound system to a group of reporters and Customs and Border Protection agents just a few feet away from the Mexico border. A gust of wind knocked over the American flag behind him as he spoke, so a CBP agent stood behind it and propped it up until the attorney general finished his speech.<br>One of the most significant takeaways from Tuesday&#039;s announcement is the revelation that his Department of Justice will ramp up its efforts to prosecute individuals suspected of &quot;transportation or harboring of aliens&quot;\u2014which could, in theory, include undocumented immigrants who house their own family members, or anyone who gives a ride to undocumented immigrants looking for work. A DOJ prosecutor interviewed by the Daily Beast, echoing the concerns of Department of Justice lawyers we spoke to before Sessions was even confirmed to his position, felt no need to mince words.<br>\u201cIt\u2019s fucking horrifying,\u201d the prosecutor said. \u201cIt\u2019s totally horrifying and we\u2019re all terrified about it, and we don\u2019t know what to do.&quot;<br><br><br>http:\/\/www.gq.com\/story\/jeff-sessio<wbr>ns-immigration-crackdown","filename":"GettyImages-647237574","ext":".jpg","w":800,"h":533,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1492093226938,"time":1492093226,"md5":"uCQ\/7pmVuyd6JMOcftNMdA==","fsize":81425,"resto":0,"id":"k6aDy8ri","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"attorney-general-jeff-sessions-is-using-his-job","country_name":"United States","replies":7,"images":0,"omitted_posts":2,"omitted_images":0},{"no":120914652,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)10:22:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120914551\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120914551<\/a><br><a href=\"#p120914518\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120914518<\/a><br><a href=\"#p120914429\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120914429<\/a><br>I really think mods need to start cracking down on fags who post clickbait sites without archiving them first","time":1492093364,"resto":120914429,"id":"F65iKdbY","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120914839,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)10:24:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120914652\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120914652<\/a><br>Why do you need an archive?<br>I gave you the text of the article","time":1492093478,"resto":120914429,"id":"k6aDy8ri","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120915036,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)10:26:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"please post link to source you faggot","time":1492093603,"resto":120914429,"id":"X1tPG4qp","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120915040,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)10:26:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120914551\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120914551<\/a><br><a href=\"#p120914518\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120914518<\/a><br>And what is wrong with these things?","time":1492093603,"resto":120914429,"id":"uglsP2sK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120915254,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)10:28:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120915036\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120915036<\/a><br>https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/politics\/c<wbr>omments\/652gpf\/attorney_general_jef<wbr>f_sessions_is_using_his_job\/","time":1492093735,"resto":120914429,"id":"k6aDy8ri","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":120913678,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)10:13:17","name":"Anonymous","sub":"We need to breed out the white race","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;breed out white men<\/span><br><br>What did she mean by this pol? <br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=vU_<wbr>y2ZaDbHk&amp;feature=youtu.be","filename":"Screen Shot 2017-04-12 at 9.00.01 PM","ext":".png","w":1208,"h":818,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":169,"tim":1492092797470,"time":1492092797,"md5":"4lm\/PX+sYBdTXtn89nyu4A==","fsize":1226029,"resto":0,"id":"VsgF861J","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"we-need-to-breed-out-the-white-race","country_name":"United States","replies":5,"images":2},{"no":120914162,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)10:17:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120913678\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120913678<\/a><br>Is it wrong to be white?","time":1492093073,"resto":120913678,"id":"wgydJTyk","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":120914314,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)10:19:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120913678\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120913678<\/a><br>Idk if that comment is a quality LARP or real.<br>But it wraps it.<br>&quot;The attempts of some muslims to appear open minded and &quot;cool&quot; to the westerns are just ridiculous...

What does that tell you about their people?<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;As news was breaking about the terror attack in London, the radicalized Muslims were simultaneously posting pictures celebrating the attack. Muslims were posting pictures with captions such as \u201callahu akbar\u201d and sharing photos of the attack as if it was a victory. What\u2019s their problem?

This is nothing more than a terrorist attack that does nothing. It literally accomplishes nothing.

This is unacceptable for many countries and can&#039;t happen, since it would be a point of no return.<br><br>- If NK gets invaded to disable the nuclear program chances are high Seoul, one of the biggest cities in the world, would be laid to ashes either by a nuke or artillery. Same goes for other cities and bases in Japan. This is also unacceptable.<br><br>- A regime change can&#039;t be done for the same reasons: As soon as the leaders of NK would realize their end is coming they would go batshit crazy.<br><br>- Same goes for trade pressure from China e.g. since again, when the NK government would realize their reign is coming to an end they would probably kamikaze the whole country.<br><br><br>I don&#039;t really see an option to get out of this without loosing Seoul and without a long, bloody conflict BUT nuking NK straight ahead. Preemptive nuclear strike disabling any chances to react.

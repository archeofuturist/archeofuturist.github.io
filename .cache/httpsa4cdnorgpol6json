It is hot. It&#039;s not a happy fun balmy beach holiday heat. It is an angry and oppressive heat. Australia is not meant to support life. There is nothing good about a 45 degree day. It got so hot in Victoria once that people were literally burned alive in their cars by a towering inferno. https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Black<wbr>_Saturday_bushfires<br><br>2. It is humid. The moment you step outside you are instantly coated in a sheen of sweat. You are always sticky. You always feel like you just stepped out of a pool. Attempting to sleep in Australia is one of the most uncomfortable experiences you will ever have.<br><br>3. The people are stupid. Like, really fucking stupid. I think the heat damages their brains.<br><br>4. There is trash everywhere. There are some streets in Melbourne that are littered with more trash than places I&#039;ve seen in Mexico.<br><br>5. Australian accents are annoying. The first week you are there you&#039;re like okay that&#039;s kinda cool\/interesting\/whatever. It gets more and more draining to have to listen to these people as time goes on. After about a month you will want to rip the fucking throat out of any Australian that speaks to you. It has this distinctly high-pitched nasal quality to it... even if they have a deep voice. It&#039;s difficult to describe but it&#039;s essentially nails on a chalkboard.","filename":"fuckingterriblem8","ext":".jpg","w":667,"h":397,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":148,"tim":1491377668894,"time":1491377668,"md5":"7+gaQoU0ATcwolpV5lDU7g==","fsize":17926,"resto":0,"id":"1DbxV8Ut","country":"NZ","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"australia-is-a-serious-contender-for-being-the","country_name":"New Zealand","replies":257,"images":62,"omitted_posts":252,"omitted_images":60,"tail_size":50},{"no":119604855,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)09:13:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119583027\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119583027<\/a><br>I would say California, if your choosing from within the US.

Us Dutch are a proud and stubborn, yet loving, people, we don&#039;t conform willingly. Our nature of tolerance and empathy has been exploited for too long.

This sea of indoctrination and injustice w\u00edll be \/polder\/ed. And we will stand strong on the new reclaimed land.<br>We will try to always converse in the universal language of the almighty mongolian goat herding forum (English), or the mighty mods might smite us again (no seriously, fuck you mods). If you want something translated, we will do that for you. All \/pol\/acks are very welcome.<br><br>We are now past the TK2017 elections, and although the right and \/ourguys\/ have won, the battle has just commenced.

I wrote her good morning beautfifull girl, all she does write is good morning and goodnight but altleast everyday. I also complimented on her calves and said she has a broad back(holy fuck I actually might be gay and autistic). All she told me was you have weird knees (I mean they are weird but wtf?). The second thing is that I had no endurence, like I would thrust her for 30 seconds and then I needed a break. Do you guys have any advice to build up &#039;&#039;sex endurance&#039;&#039;? She stayed until the next day and I have to say the best part for me was to have someone to cuddle with and to hold her.<br>I don&#039;t know why im writing all this but I guess i just have to tell someone about this and I love you guys.

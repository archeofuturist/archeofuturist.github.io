All of us liberal city folks will continue using our superior intellectual capabilities to build robots and put Trump supporters out of jobs and watch as their racist white communities die out from no jobs. All of their kids will have to come to the cities and be exposed to diversity and tolerance and see how much better it is than the hate and bigotry that Trump represents. We will also grant citizenship to the tens of millions of undocumented immigrants, and allow more non-white people to come in, further solidifying a progressive diverse America that votes in universal healthcare, socialism and social justice policies that help everyone and dismantle white power structures that Trumpets want to preserve.<br>This is the end of Trump, the beginning of freeing America from the grip of Russian control.","filename":"2cd","ext":".png","w":600,"h":621,"tn_w":241,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491195966376,"time":1491195966,"md5":"IWFvo5pUsOo1\/hWFpS0uqA==","fsize":39060,"resto":0,"id":"BPa8NDzM","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"tinkle-tinkle-little-tsar","country_name":"United States","replies":3,"images":1},{"no":119293544,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)01:06:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;muh idenity politics<\/span><br><br>more pathetic as time goes on","time":1491196018,"resto":119293473,"id":"KraW42q4","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119293761,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)01:09:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"This is now a pony thread.","filename":"07fa03be6676ca10e088449075d460f6","ext":".jpg","w":736,"h":940,"tn_w":97,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491196169996,"time":1491196169,"md5":"PrbV7agtZy80W7esHql34A==","fsize":59856,"resto":119293473,"id":"yBNE6Xmk","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119293978,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)01:12:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119293544\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119293544<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;no argument<\/span><br>As expected from an uneducated Trump supporter.

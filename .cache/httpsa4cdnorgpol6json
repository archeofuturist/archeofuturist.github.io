It turned out to be a colleague of hers. See the info above for the damning proof. <br><br>* Tealeaves has a years-old wordpress account coincidentally named in leetspeak teakettle (t34k3ttl3). That&#039;s him. BTW I don&#039;t believe that FeelTheEmailMistake guy found it the way he says. I think he had to present it in a more eh &quot;public safe&quot; manner if you get my drift. Based on some other posts of his i think this guy is into some seriously heavy shit...and think about the timing of all this.<br><br>* The DNS logs contain + signs -- meaning recursive nameserver-nameserver queries which just doesnt happen. Even if we say the Russian nameservers have some weird setup -- well, the American medical nameservers have the same weird setup. Every damn nameserver has the same weird setup. Terribly unlikely...<br><br>* The guy mentions 6 indicators of forgery... says hes only &#039;reasonably confident&#039; based on the indicator above... but it&#039;s pretty fucking damning all by itself.

The church fathers were absolutely the worst anti Semites by today&#039;s standards. Jesus was a Jew born of the Holy Spirit. <br><br>The ancient Hebrews were always subversive and stiff necked but they were also a lot different from what they are today, since they murdered Christ and were cursed for it... &quot;Let his blood be upon us and upon our children.&quot;<br><br>Jesus was not just &quot;a Jew&quot;. He was the first born of all creation. He is the Word made flesh. Don&#039;t get tied up in heresies because modern day evangelicals are all &quot;we stand with Israel&quot; - real genuine Christianity isn&#039;t like that.","time":1491676554,"resto":120158886,"id":"hyxzaQQB","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120164850,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)14:38:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120164348\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120164348<\/a><br> Amen!","filename":"image","ext":".jpg","w":236,"h":334,"tn_w":88,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491676735863,"time":1491676735,"md5":"rjHP6Oe92EukBW0jxgJkow==","fsize":35910,"resto":120158886,"id":"hyxzaQQB","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120165714,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)14:45:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"praise be to the Lord Jesus Christ","time":1491677146,"resto":120158886,"id":"hyxzaQQB","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120166363,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)14:51:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120161213\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120161213<\/a><br><br>That&#039;s not cool man, get over that please","time":1491677496,"resto":120158886,"id":"hyxzaQQB","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120166992,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)14:57:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120158886\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120158886<\/a><br>Lord, praise You for your great Glory.

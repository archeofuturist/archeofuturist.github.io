Things aren\u2019t as good for us as they were for our parents. But billions of people in the third world would still kill to have the opportunity that you do right now. So take care of yourself! Work your ass off, every day, to build a good life for you, and for your family. Spend your time wisely, and keep your real life priorities in order. Work hard, but also do fun and wholesome things with real people in real life. That is very important. Nothing on the internet should ever take away from your real life.","filename":"1486808350389","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":1136,"tn_w":140,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493790553916,"time":1493790553,"md5":"UBmd5BN2kyWRMYummeNW8Q==","fsize":357148,"resto":0,"id":"4YyqkUzD","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-most-important-thing-you-can-do-for-the-white","country_name":"United States","replies":3,"images":0},{"no":123878869,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)01:51:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123878699\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123878699<\/a><br>fuck you and fuck your copypasta and fuck this girl with my dick","time":1493790673,"resto":123878699,"id":"x96GxI\/0","country":"JP","country_name":"Japan"},{"no":123879025,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)01:53:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123878869\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123878869<\/a><br>No one wants your snack sized dick mate","time":1493790780,"resto":123878699,"id":"J92j2m7y","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":123879515,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)01:58:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123878699\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123878699<\/a><br>Man I haven&#039;t seen new pics of Angie Varona","time":1493791106,"resto":123878699,"id":"BMyA+ExU","country":"JP","country_name":"Japan"}]}]}

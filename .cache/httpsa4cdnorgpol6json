Generally the East and North tend to be more Germanic whereas the West and South tend to be more Celtic. But there are exceptions like Dorset being more Germanic or Cumbria being more Celtic. Then there are the Norwegian Vikings who greatly contributed to those in the Lancashire and Manchester area, especially the costal parts. So really it depends where you&#039;re from. Wales is a lot more Celtic than West England but not drastically as you might expect. Generally the Lowland Scots are more Germanic due to initial Anglo Saxon migrations and the Anglo-Danish migration after the Norman sacking of Northumbria. But in places like Ayrshire or Perthsire it is clearly more Celtic whereas Fife, the Borders, and parts of Dumfriesshire are more Germanic. The rest of Scotland and pretty much all of Ireland is Celtic. Except for places the Norwegian Vikings touched like the islands and some of the very coastal areas of Southern and Eastern Ireland.<br><br>All in all, it&#039;s a mix, but really genetically speaking there is barely any difference between the Anglo-Saxons along with other Germanic groups and the Insular Celts (Celts found in the British Isles), Belgae, and some Northern Gauls in the first place.","time":1490141416,"resto":117674092,"id":"\/pNZPxmM","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]},{"posts":[{"no":117683039,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)18:54:37","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Childfree Antinatalism","com":"pol\/ is anyone else shocked by the fact that people still have children?

I for one am childfree and although I am only a measly 19 years of age I plan to get sterilized. I am an antinatalist. Antinatalism is the most advanced form of evolution. We can reason and make logical decisions unlike animals. Once we realize that having children is a pointless absurd silly thing to do we reach the pinnacle of human evolution. Prove me wrong.

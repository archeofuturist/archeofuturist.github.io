So at the end of the monologue, I had a few choice insults for the President in return. I don\u2019t regret that. He, I believe, can take care of himself. I have jokes; he has the launch codes. So it\u2019s a fair fight.<br><br>So while I would do it again, I would change a few words that were cruder than they needed to be. I\u2019m not going to repeat the phrase, but I just want to say for the record, life is short, and anyone who expresses their love for another person, in their own way, is to me, an American hero. I think we can all agree on that. I hope even the President and I can agree on that.

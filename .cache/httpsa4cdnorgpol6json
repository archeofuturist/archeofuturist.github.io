So why are we, generally speaking, poorer than the west? <br><br>Because it&#039;s not in the interest of the politicians to fix our shit, to make us great again. Why would they, when they can use the collective anger of our people, under the threat of an Imminent Serbian invasion, to ensure themselves to remain in power for the next generations? If the people are happy, if their economic troubles are covered, then they&#039;d see the political troubles of our country, and Rama, Meta and Basha (three main politicians) would be hanging on front of the capital square.","filename":"1489950567720","ext":".gif","w":500,"h":375,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1490891776645,"time":1490891776,"md5":"5esxJlkvqrW4q5qLrofH1w==","fsize":2911986,"resto":118932600,"id":"K0z8wGFq","country":"AL","country_name":"Albania"},{"no":118937881,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)12:36:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118936882\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118936882<\/a><br>how will albo-zergs ever recover?","filename":"2 (1)","ext":".jpg","w":704,"h":576,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":102,"tim":1490891801920,"time":1490891801,"md5":"RKv5Zifat9iD1prEGnd\/nQ==","fsize":31806,"resto":118932600,"id":"DhAVTC07","country":"BG","country_name":"Bulgaria"},{"no":118938270,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)12:40:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118936882\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118936882<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Raid 12 homes <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Find 3 Pocket knives<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Find A glock<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Find a flag in the room of a minor<\/span><br><br>Wow, they were going to blow up all of Italy with those.","time":1490892027,"resto":118932600,"id":"K0z8wGFq","country":"AL","country_name":"Albania"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118920310,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)09:28:05","name":"\/POLDER\/","sub":"MARXISME FESTIVAL UvA RAID","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;ORGANISE FOR THE RAID OF MARXIST FESTIVAL AT THE UNIVERSITY OF AMSTERDAM<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;WE CALL FOR ALL \/POL\/ACKS IN THE NETHERLANDS TO COME AND PROTEST AGAINST COMMUNISM AND FOR OUR FREEDOM<\/span><br><br>Welcome to \/polder\/, home of the Dutch Resistance, fighting for truth, justice and liberty for the people of The Netherlands.

(We use property tax instead of full abolition)<br>2. A heavy progressive or graduated income tax. (less now than it was)<br>3. Abolition of all rights of inheritance. (estate tax)<br>4. Confiscation of the property of all emigrants and rebels. (Civil forfeiture and sanctions)<br>5. Centralisation of credit in the hands of the state, by means of a national bank with State capital and an exclusive monopoly. (Federal Reserve)<br>6. Centralisation of the means of communication and transport in the hands of the State. (Utility companies) <br>7. Extension of factories and instruments of production owned by the State; the bringing into cultivation of waste-lands, and the improvement of the soil generally in accordance with a common plan. (New Deal and TVA)<br>8. Equal liability of all to work. Establishment of industrial armies, especially for agriculture. (TVA)<br>9. Combination of agriculture with manufacturing industries; gradual abolition of all the distinction between town and country by a more equable distribution of the populace over the country. (Pretty much abandoned except in a few programs)<br>10. Free education for all children in public schools. Abolition of children\u2019s factory labour in its present form. Combination of education with industrial production. (Dept of Education, Child services)<br><br>Do you guys see? America has already been almost entirely communist for a very long time.

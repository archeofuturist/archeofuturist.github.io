He and a friend of his, Father Justin Garvey were involved in the investigation with the Bellingham and Lummi nation police departments. I could never get a lot of info from him about this stuff, only a few talks here and there. What I did get though was there was a human trafficking ring that went from Vancouver B.C. all the way down the west coast of the United States. Victoria island was involved as well somehow. I remember hearing that there were a lot of kidnappings among the Native American tribes and that there was some involvement in human trafficking with some of the police officers too. I remember hearing that there were a large amount of police officers in general involved in these human trafficking rings. I didnt know it until I was an adult, but my mom said that our family was threatened twice, one time by a Lummi police chief.

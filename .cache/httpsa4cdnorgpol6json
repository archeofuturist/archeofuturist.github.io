Is it a net benefit for us to form alliances (temporary or more lasting) with other groups on the right? <br><br>Utilizing civic nationalists, libertarians, fundamentalist christians, paleocons etc., helps greatly to boost our influence. The left has been using disparate minority and interest groups in a unified struggle against whitey and normalcy to pretty good effect for a few decades now. Maybe we should steal their tactic? The Trump phenomenon used this to some degree. And while Trump is only a marginal improvement for nationalists in terms of policy so far, I think we can all agree he has done much to shift the Overton Window in our direction.<br> <br>Solidarity is also beneficial considering the increasingly dire demographic situation the US is in. We just simply don&#039;t have the numbers to fight off the united rainbow coalition of the left if the right is splintered into 1000 groups. Allying allows us a bigger presence in the culture and provides us an opportunity to expose, and hopefully draw, others to our ideologies. <br><br>On the other hand, I see major issues with a big tent strategy. The most obvious is the potential of subversion. The united right is only desirable if the right&#039;s leadership are wielding it to further our goals.

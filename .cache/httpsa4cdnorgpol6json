The only thing that could have prevented that was the Guardian Council blocking him from standing. <br>Shills are saying that Khameini blocked him. If that was the case, he wouldn&#039;t be on the list. <br>He is massively popular in Iran and will easily win a plurality. The only thing that could possibly stand in his way is if Khameini has let him run to send a message to the US i.e. &quot;back the fuck off, or this is what you get.&quot; If the US eases off, then the GC might instruct him to pull out. Of course, it&#039;s also possible that Ahmadinehad knows this himself and is just doing another service for his country.<br>tl:dr Ahmadinejad is guaranteed to win the popular vote in Iran if he&#039;s still standing on election day.","filename":"1_khamenei_askquran.ir_-e1435174214663","ext":".jpg","w":900,"h":591,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":82,"tim":1492023091713,"time":1492023091,"md5":"edQ3B5eCEmnczBAH+CgERg==","fsize":118753,"resto":120772845,"id":"wu7SFYL0","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120791331,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)14:54:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120790915\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120790915<\/a><br>we will OBLITERATE Iran in a nuclear fire. no worrying here, friend.","time":1492023285,"resto":120772845,"id":"iu8LX5TE","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120791480,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)14:56:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120772845\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120772845<\/a><br><a href=\"#p120774539\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120774539<\/a><br><br><br>OUR GUY","time":1492023360,"resto":120772845,"id":"FUoDmqcK","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"}]},{"posts":[{"no":120788569,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)14:32:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"Stop having arguments.","filename":"stefan","ext":".jpg","w":373,"h":373,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492021960693,"time":1492021960,"md5":"YanZlTURGymnYdzERNtMzw==","fsize":21149,"resto":0,"id":"GKNKIh4M","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"stop-having-arguments","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":11,"images":7,"omitted_posts":6,"omitted_images":4},{"no":120790672,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)14:49:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120788569\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120788569<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Not an argument<\/span>","filename":"2017-04-12 20.48.42","ext":".jpg","w":373,"h":373,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492022979530,"time":1492022979,"md5":"ZLncBcLc7b+566WhCuXOGQ==","fsize":25800,"resto":120788569,"id":"L9JPYVNB","country":"ZA","country_name":"South Africa"},{"no":120790854,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)14:51:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120790672\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120790672<\/a><br>I need some fuckin&#039; arguments man my superior intellect is dyin&#039; here","filename":"546426765785","ext":".jpg","w":698,"h":776,"tn_w":112,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492023060440,"time":1492023060,"md5":"oCQfhrCPzLdwXrD70RMKAQ==","fsize":65967,"resto":120788569,"id":"GKNKIh4M","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120791174,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)14:53:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"recommend me some channels bois","filename":"abos","ext":".png","w":228,"h":313,"tn_w":91,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492023213733,"time":1492023213,"md5":"A7iXiOJjJpWHouKssUqN9A==","fsize":18387,"resto":120788569,"id":"R9\/WEzEq","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":120791273,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)14:54:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120788569\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120788569<\/a><br>STOP HIM MIKE!","time":1492023260,"resto":120788569,"id":"gNipyoWU","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":120791477,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)14:55:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120791273\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120791273<\/a><br>MIKE!","filename":"2017-04-12 20.54.25","ext":".jpg","w":1632,"h":1632,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492023358921,"time":1492023358,"md5":"Q1kyEXNgiqvzLYdGp5xzAw==","fsize":210621,"resto":120788569,"id":"L9JPYVNB","country":"ZA","m_img":1,"country_name":"South Africa"}]}]}

Not into casual sex with strangers. Shy, enjoys puns. Quite independent but not to the point of ridiculousness like some females. Smart, very very smart. Also determined and driven.

She insists I am the perfect man, (someone must&#039;ve dropped her on her head or something) and though I&#039;ve thought internally that oh this is just some little crush she&#039;s just playing, it&#039;s been 8 months and there has been no sign of her changing her mind. So my little &quot;oh she&#039;s just playing&quot; theory, has been squashed. Not going to lie, pretty damn cute as well.

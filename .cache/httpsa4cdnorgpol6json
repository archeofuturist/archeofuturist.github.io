Genetically, culturally and linguistically, they are Bulgarian. They are brainwashed to think they are Greek, but they are still Bulgarian.<br><br>Quick story:<br>Thirty-thousand Bulgars, led by Asparux (one of five brothers who went their own way out of Old Great Bulgaria) entered the area of modern Bulgaria and befriended the seven Slavic tribes (Bulgars protected the Slavs from the Byzantines). Under Bulgar command, the entire invading Byzantine army was destroyed. The Bulgars, although the ruling class, were much less numerous than the Slavs and Thracians, of which there were many, and therefore quickly assimilated into Slavic culture (although many aspects of Bulgar and Thracian culture remained), until by the 10th century they had adopted the Slavic language, with the Bulgar language going extinct in the kingdom (Bulgaria also created the Cyrillic alphabet :D). This is what happens when the Bulgars were &lt;1% of the total population. Yet the country has their name, which is astounding! Bulgaria is the oldest country in Europe that hasn&#039;t changed its name since it was first established!<br><br>European history is fucking fascinating.","filename":"1000 AD","ext":".jpg","w":1203,"h":884,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":91,"tim":1490317914381,"time":1490317914,"md5":"VJJ365xZBFvO6MblIfMttA==","fsize":245811,"resto":118002059,"id":"R1hI1fpd","country":"CA","m_img":1,"country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118017353,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)21:14:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118016045\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118016045<\/a><br>Serbia was an indepent country for nearly a century and was internationaly recognized in 1878.

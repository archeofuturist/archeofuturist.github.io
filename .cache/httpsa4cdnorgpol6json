Contrary to what the Anglo-Saxon savage has taught you, Celtic nations are not exclusive to the British Isles, in fact we are one of the most diverse group of peoples in Western Europe, ranging from Asturias all the way to Breizh. Underneath this text you will find the celtic countries listed to spare confusion.<br><br>- Asturias: Between the regions of Galicia and Cantabria in northern Spain.<br>- Breizh: In Brittany on France\u2019s northwest coast.<br>- Kernow: In the county of Cornwall on England\u2019s west coast.<br>- Galicia\/Northern Portugal: On Iberia\u2019s northwest coast.<br>- Eire: Ireland.<br>- Mannin: The Isle of Man.<br>- Alba: Scotland<br>- Cymru: Wales<br><br>Remember brothers, the anglo has raped our women and pillaged our cities and villages for millennia. Never forget the fallen of our peoples who were sent to die across the world because of a bunch of fugly anglo neckbearded generals who used Scots, Welsh and Irishmen alike as cannon-fodder for their brutal wars against other White European countries.","filename":"4 provinces","ext":".jpg","w":1612,"h":1044,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":161,"tim":1492111503748,"time":1492111503,"md5":"1+zmomS51+OhB\/UzgggTbg==","fsize":471407,"resto":0,"id":"lAue5TVi","country":"IE","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"celtpol-gaelic-supremacy-edition","country_name":"Ireland","replies":24,"images":8,"omitted_posts":19,"omitted_images":4},{"no":120951471,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)15:35:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120950909\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120950909<\/a><br>they are more normie than me","time":1492112127,"resto":120950127,"id":"4OHiTY7b","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120951625,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)15:36:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120951457\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120951457<\/a><br>You engage in conversation in your own language: English","time":1492112188,"resto":120950127,"id":"PeBy0vFm","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120951824,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)15:37:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120951625\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120951625<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;when a burger even knows that ireland has more of a claim to the english language than his own degenerate racemixed failed prototype of europe<\/span>","time":1492112274,"resto":120950127,"id":"z5rtTXPf","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"},{"no":120952088,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)15:40:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120951824\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120951824<\/a><br>we wuz anglo n sheeit we runnin up on niggas houses n shit we ain fuck around mane","filename":"1492108843505","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":758,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":92,"tim":1492112404376,"time":1492112404,"md5":"2k8zEC2XNinmMytrB1ZYiw==","fsize":158051,"resto":120950127,"id":"SxLmVEMZ","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":120952299,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)15:41:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120952088\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120952088<\/a><br>Go tend to your bull, Svencuck","time":1492112505,"resto":120950127,"id":"OsseUGtl","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"}]},{"posts":[{"no":120950861,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)15:30:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"Thoughts on this guy?","filename":"Franciscus_in_2015","ext":".jpg","w":220,"h":291,"tn_w":189,"tn_h":249,"tim":1492111850986,"time":1492111850,"md5":"rzzdTAQC9otJ8mUPv9Hquw==","fsize":13063,"resto":0,"id":"y8x\/gxP9","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"thoughts-on-this-guy","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":2,"images":0},{"no":120950995,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)15:31:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120950861\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120950861<\/a><br>c<br>*clap*<br>u<br>*clap*<br>c<br>*clap*<br>k<br>*clap clap*<br>C<br>U<br>C<br>K<br>C U C K <br>KEK","time":1492111910,"resto":120950861,"id":"CF6T3zje","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120952296,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)15:41:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120950861\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120950861<\/a><br>Said he will split the Catholic Church in 2016 to German newspaper.<br>Installed statue of arch-heretic Luther in Vatican.<br>Practices intercommunion ecumenism.<br>Downplays doctrine.<br>Punishes traditional Orders.<br>Attempting to (and actually allowing via Amoris Laetitia) allow world-wide allowance of divorced and &quot;remarried&quot;

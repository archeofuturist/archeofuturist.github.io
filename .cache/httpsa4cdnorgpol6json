Drug trafficking creates more poor and broken people, and kids that grow up dumber as a result. This sort of thing can apply to any race, but yes, desperate people typically will turn to harsh means to survive. Crime seems like an easy answer. Giving better social services (including, but not limited to, decent education) alleviates the issue considerably.

In America this is becoming a major issue. I personally believe insurance, like usury, is an inherent scam. It should be outlawed all together. This would bring prices back down to what the market would dictate an average person could afford. Also on the other hand, a welfare program for those who can&#039;t work to subsidize the costs should be instituted.<br>Insurance is gambling. Which is under prohibition. Perhaps maybe a loan program provided by the state without usury in order to cover said medical bills is the good option for the welfare I&#039;m speaking of.","filename":"1493347450696","ext":".jpg","w":251,"h":189,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":188,"tim":1493911370854,"time":1493911370,"md5":"us1iX7bFMu+pEscnRWJAjQ==","fsize":6383,"resto":0,"id":"xeFG6bol","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"so-lets-talk-about-insurance-in-america-this-is","country_name":"United States","replies":17,"images":0,"omitted_posts":12,"omitted_images":0},{"no":124074601,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)12:07:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124070068\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124070068<\/a><br>You must be a hoot at parties","time":1493914025,"resto":124070068,"id":"HgWI2fLU","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"},{"no":124074689,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)12:08:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124074536\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124074536<\/a><br>You need to read the op.

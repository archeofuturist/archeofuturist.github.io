Most of Polish farmers found other markets to replace Russian one, but they didn&#039;t want to burn bridges, because sanctions don&#039;t last forever, so they export their stuff to Russia but visa proxy: Belarus, Kazakhstan and other countries of so called &quot;russian world&quot;. F.e.: Belarus began to import 26x more plums and 30x more milk from Poland after sanctions were introduced, which surely looks kind of suspicious but Russians probably don&#039;t care xD. Later on Belarusians mark these things with their trademark and sell to Russia as &quot;Belarusian product&quot;. Sometimes they are even too lazy to mark it as a product from Belarus, so they send trucks full of Polish products straight to Russian shops, risking that they are going to be checked by Russian police. If the Russian policeman is not bribed propery, it indeed happens, and then all these products are destroyed in front of camera accordingto Putin&#039;s Law, and showed in Russian TV to the audience. <br><br>Thanks to sanctions and Putin&#039;s grand strategy Poland sells as much products to the East as never before, for higher prices. Final consumers (Russians) pay 2x-3x higher price for these products thinking that they are Belarusian\/Kazakh\/Serbian\/whatever.<wbr> <br><br>Destruction of Polish tea and red caviar: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=B6J<wbr>vf1Iubb8<br>Destruction of Polish pears: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=7V0<wbr>6-Wbl3Hw<br>Destruction of Polish apples: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=x7F<wbr>cTK8rdWM<br>Destruction of Polish mushrooms: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=M_n<wbr>e5BhD6jg<br>Destruction of Polish meat: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=uQ-<wbr>1ruOsbys","filename":"sanctions russia","ext":".jpg","w":1365,"h":1684,"tn_w":202,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490434582095,"time":1490434582,"md5":"AtTEYwGW\/hcQZ06rHZE36g==","fsize":495800,"resto":0,"id":"F8+XfCjR","country":"PL","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"polish-thread-about-roosia","country_name":"Poland","replies":70,"images":22,"omitted_posts":65,"omitted_images":19},{"no":118222280,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)09:04:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"Polish, Russia is taking your people if not your food.

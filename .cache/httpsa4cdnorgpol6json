Of course, the Russians seem to be taken all the credit for the election going into Trumps hands by the mainstream media. I mean, Russia likely did contribute, but I don&#039;t think it&#039;s really as much as people say because I&#039;ve met more Trump supporters in California than I have met Clinton supporters easy and that&#039;s a blue state.<br><br>Basically, there is no proof, and while it&#039;s obvious that the Russians have influenced Trump&#039;s picks, it should not really be surprising considering the massive amounts of data that got hacked in Obama&#039;s second term.

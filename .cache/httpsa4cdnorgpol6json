It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side.\u201d<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Now, Trump is on the witness list in a Florida court battle over how federal prosecutors handled allegations that Epstein, 64, sexually abused more than 40 minor girls, most of them between the ages of 13 and 17. The lawsuit questions why Trump\u2019s nominee for labor secretary, former Miami U.S. attorney Alexander Acosta, whose confirmation hearing is scheduled to begin Wednesday, cut a non-prosecution deal with Epstein a decade ago rather than pursuing a federal indictment that Acosta\u2019s staff had advocated.<\/span><br>Prosecutors in Acosta\u2019s Miami office who had joined the FBI in the investigation concluded, according to documents produced by the U.S. attorney\u2019s office, that Epstein, working through several female assistants, \u201cwould recruit underage females to travel to his home in Palm Beach to engage in lewd conduct in exchange for money. ... Some went there as much as 100 times or more. Some of the women\u2019s conduct was limited to performing a topless or nude massage while Mr. Epstein masturbated himself. For other women, the conduct escalated to full sexual intercourse.\u201d<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In the 2011 letter explaining his decision in the Epstein case, Acosta said he backed off from pressing charges after \u201ca year-long assault on the prosecution and the prosecutors\u201d by \u201can army of legal superstars\u201d who represented Epstein, including Harvard Law professor Alan Dershowitz; Kenneth Starr, who as independent counsel led the investigation that brought about President Bill Clinton\u2019s impeachment; and some of the nation\u2019s most prominent defense attorneys, such as Roy Black, Gerald Lefcourt and Jay Lefkowitz.<\/span>","filename":"pizzagate ramsay","ext":".png","w":1764,"h":1440,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":204,"tim":1490146878270,"time":1490146878,"md5":"vDYdGfr27McHwaqN33FoVA==","fsize":2552507,"resto":0,"id":"IzeoanzV","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"pzzagate-is-back-in-the-news","country_name":"United States","replies":168,"images":73,"omitted_posts":163,"omitted_images":71,"tail_size":50},{"no":117737681,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)04:12:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"Sage and onions.

The answer to that question is noone. You might think the elites might use it to rid the earth of their enemies and reduce population, but even for them this way of doing it a) causes to many side effects and influence on nature and b) has too many variables, since you can&#039;t be sure who nukes where and you can&#039;t plan the outcome good enough to be able to stabilize a new society afterwards.<br><br>I mean look at the war zones we have today, war isn&#039;t what it used to be and the war in those countries is neverending. In a land where the infrastructure is destroyed, economics don&#039;t exist anymore and people lost all good belief there will be only chaos. This chaos would last for at least some decades and again the outcome would be very unstable and hard to plan for.<br><br>Second we have to ask ourselves why everyone keeps their bombs then. This one is simple and you heard it before: So no madman can push the button without killing himself. And there is a second answer: You can use nuclear weapons on a smaller scale for tactical combat. Small rounds with nuclear parts that wreck a lot of devastation will come, will be in use and will not influence nature too much. You can predict the outcome.

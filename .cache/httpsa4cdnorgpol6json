Thus, when SK&#039;s economy is damaged, it&#039;s garrisons overdrawn and it&#039;s militias drafted, NK might finally have favorable ground to stage an aggressive invasion, or at the very least a greater recognition and legitimacy in the world&#039;s eye.","time":1492157195,"resto":121012082,"id":"nWgu\/ykH","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121035922,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)04:07:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"inb4<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;NK gets razed by a very expensive missile volley<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;literally every known and suspected major location<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;collateral not out of the question<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;President Trump: &quot;I was thinking of the chilluns&quot;<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;China: &quot;we&#039;re thinking of what to rename your country once we take it&quot;<\/span>","time":1492157274,"resto":121012082,"id":"qmlTu8T8","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":121026358,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)01:59:19","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Habbening: Moves By CIA Director Mike Pompeo Known In Advance","com":"http:\/\/animeright.news\/zanting\/zant<wbr>ing-moves-by-cia-director-mike-pomp<wbr>eo-known-in-advance","filename":"Screen Shot 2017-04-13 at 10.54.13 PM","ext":".png","w":822,"h":344,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":104,"tim":1492149559426,"time":1492149559,"md5":"xqDANI5cMESq7y0lGSxh3g==","fsize":113376,"resto":0,"id":"cDBegCTo","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"habbening-moves-by-cia-director-mike-pompeo-known","country_name":"United States","replies":28,"images":5,"omitted_posts":23,"omitted_images":2},{"no":121030336,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)02:50:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;pedophile spooks try to fuck over Trump for going against their warmongering<\/span><br><br>When are these fucking rats finally going to be burned alive along with their families?","time":1492152614,"resto":121026358,"id":"LppSguAH","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121031342,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)03:03:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"So no one finds it odd that Pompeo is now suddenly coming to light after three months of being MIA?<br><br>So lets see...Syrian missile strikes happen and Pompeo is conveniently missing from the photo op in the room with Trump and his cabinet. <br><br>Syrian strikes happen and alt right media, Assad, Putin, etc say its a US created false flag.

Students of color score higher on tests when they have teachers who look like them, and all students benefit from exposure to more diverse cultural perspectives.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The need is illustrated by students like Tsakani Khambule, a senior at Washington High School who sometimes worries her white teachers won&#039;t understand her South African accent. &quot;You don&#039;t speak,&quot; Khambule said. &quot;You don&#039;t talk because you&#039;re afraid.&quot;<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Students of color make up more than a third of the district&#039;s enrollment, but its teacher workforce is 98 percent white, a number that&#039;s hardly changed in decades. Maher made narrowing that gap a priority in his first strategic plan as superintendent. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Teachers nationwide lack diversity, according to the U.S. Department of Education, but Sioux Falls lags even the marginal national increases in teacher diversity seen in the last three decades.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Hitting the teacher diversity goal will mean making sure about 1 in 10 new hires over the next decade are nonwhite.

My hometown was 98.4 white or something, basically hadn&#039;t changed racial demographics since the time my great great grandfather was plowing the fields out there. <br><br>But this article is a little misleading, Sioux Falls only has one high school with a remotely sizable non white population, and it&#039;s near a mostly refugee area. Totally doesn&#039;t seem like a big deal to have more teachers of color there and, as far as I know, there&#039;s no push for other schools to do the same. So, seems kind of like just a normal thing to do, giving displaced populations the chance to be taught by their own people. Honestly, SD refugee populations are pretty based too, there&#039;s not nearly as much crime in their community as stats generally tend to suggest their would be, and their neighborhoods are honestly pretty indistinguishable for the rest of the city (i.e. they&#039;re pretty nice, but maybe a few more ethnically inspired restaurants). The extreme cold seems to have a mollifying effect on pretty much everyone, to be honest. When you can die by going outside for fifteen minutes without a coat for half the year, you&#039;re stuck inside and you don&#039;t really have a choice but to form stable bonds with the people around you.","time":1493301203,"resto":123033655,"id":"Th0OL1Pr","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123038658,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)09:56:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123033655\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123033655<\/a><br>i&#039;s be yo teacha fo today","filename":"1492527578612","ext":".png","w":487,"h":555,"tn_w":109,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493301403203,"time":1493301403,"md5":"V8pHRE8BlZoAQ9O9aYeYrg==","fsize":677768,"resto":123033655,"id":"UVsBabmw","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123039930,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)10:10:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123037395\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123037395<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;reverse racism<\/span>","time":1493302253,"resto":123033655,"id":"cPlGdd\/E","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":123034052,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)09:05:25","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Are you guys against all immigration or just the illegal ones","com":"Cause your companies and hospitals ( especially Medical research as we are not medicine men like white doctors who graduated from western diploma mills) can&#039;t function without Indian intellectuals","filename":"c-a-www-google-co-in-search-google-why-indian-arel-why-indian-are-1702684","ext":".png","w":500,"h":438,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":219,"tim":1493298325907,"time":1493298325,"md5":"2lroBNE3\/0ydoaOVJSj\/PA==","fsize":25623,"resto":0,"id":"lh2lsuE1","country":"IN","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"are-you-guys-against-all-immigration-or-just-the","country_name":"India","replies":10,"images":1,"omitted_posts":5,"omitted_images":1},{"no":123036827,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)09:37:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123034950\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123034950<\/a><br>like 20 brits ran your whole nation.","filename":"1483627631484s","ext":".jpg","w":208,"h":250,"tn_w":104,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493300221868,"time":1493300221,"md5":"4VFCLt+0Sw0OTT\/Y9oDaBA==","fsize":9631,"resto":123034052,"id":"NYba9nAZ","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":123037468,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)09:44:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123034052\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123034052<\/a><br>I was all for (legal) immigration back when there were not many immigrants.

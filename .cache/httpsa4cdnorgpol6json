However, practically speaking, Christianity has a key difference that separates it from other belief systems that are considered religions. That difference is relationship.<br><br>Most religion, theistic or otherwise, is man-centered. Any relationship with God is based on man\u2019s works. A theistic religion, such as Judaism or Islam, holds to the belief in a supreme God or gods; while nontheistic religions, such as Buddhism and Hinduism, focus on metaphysical thought patterns and spiritual \u201cenergies.\u201d But most religions are similar in that they are built upon the concept that man can reach a higher power or state of being through his own efforts. In most religions, man is the aggressor and the deity is the beneficiary of man\u2019s efforts, sacrifices, or good deeds. Paradise, nirvana, or some higher state of being is man\u2019s reward for his strict adherence to whatever tenets that religion prescribes.<br><br>In that regard, Christianity isnota religion; it is a relationship that God has established with His children. In Christianity, God is the aggressor and man is the beneficiary (Romans 8:3). The Bible states clearly that there is nothing man can do to make himself right with God (Isaiah 53:6;64:6;Romans 3:23;6:23). According to Christianity, God did for us what we cannot do for ourselves (Colossians 2:13;2 Corinthians 5:21). Our sin separates us from His presence, and sin must be punished (Romans 6:23;Matthew 10:28;23:33). But, because God loves us, He took our punishment upon Himself. All we must do is accept God\u2019s gift of salvation through faith (Ephesians 2:8\u20139;2 Corinthians 5:21).Graceis God\u2019s blessing on the undeserving.","filename":"tmp_8418-52c46ddaa4061695b3dfd2531760e591-711094984","ext":".jpg","w":1134,"h":1693,"tn_w":167,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493341195734,"time":1493341195,"md5":"DKnl\/sNVcpnq7x7u26y+GA==","fsize":746521,"resto":0,"id":"9Q5Vclhh","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"question-is-christianity-a-religion-or-a","country_name":"United States","replies":29,"images":4,"omitted_posts":24,"omitted_images":4},{"no":123126617,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)21:50:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123125847\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123125847<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;At least Christianity isn&#039;t hated to death unlike islam.<\/span><br>If your enemies don&#039;t hate you, what did you achieve?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Also Muhammad fucked a child.<\/span><br>Nope.

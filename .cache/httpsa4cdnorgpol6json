Adelson, the casino magnate and stalwart Republican donor, gave $5 million to support the festivities surrounding President Trump\u2019s inauguration, according to federal election filings.<br><br>The gift was the largest single contribution ever given to an inauguration, but far from the only seven-figure check deposited by the committee responsible for carrying out much of the pomp leading up to Mr. Trump\u2019s swearing-in.<br><br>A 510-page disclosure report filed with the Federal Election Commission on Tuesday shows more than two dozen million-dollar checks from corporations and wealthy individuals, including Robert K. Kraft, the owner of the New England Patriots and a close friend of Mr. Trump\u2019s; Steven A. Cohen and Charles Schwab, both billionaire investors; and Robert R. Parsons.<br><br>In previous inaugurations, individuals were allowed to make contributions only up to $250,000. Limits are set by the administrations themselves.<br>Altogether Mr. Trump raised $107 million for his inauguration, twice the previous fund-raising record, which was set by Barack Obama in 2009.","filename":"SheldonAdelson","ext":".jpg","w":650,"h":495,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":190,"tim":1492625570795,"time":1492625570,"md5":"K9yzfmo7b\/wJxQmm6SaWMg==","fsize":29274,"resto":0,"id":"RzJgadcz","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"jews-are-the-biggest-donors-to-trump","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":121873756,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)14:12:44","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Naming the REAL Jew","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;women<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;age 25-50<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;single<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;not fit<\/span><br>This the is group of people working night and day to destroy western nations.

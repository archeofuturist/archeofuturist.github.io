In a nutshell what i found out:<br><br>Murtis Taylor (the company that Joy Lane works at) is a corrupt AF agency who neglects people who depend on them for mental health treatment resulting in a lot of people who end up losing their shit, killing themselves, and killing others.<br><br>Murtis Taylor also uses their power to take kids from homes for BS reasons and sues to gain legal custody of children to put into foster care<br><br>Beech Brook (killers former workplace) is a facility for troubled children, and until last year also functioned as an adoption\/foster care agency\/facility<br><br>These two places are within miles and in the same county as the international adoption agency that the FBI raided months ago<br><br>Children were sexually abused at Beech Brook by its staff<br><br>More than 3100 reports of missing children in 2015 in this county alone<br><br>Dozens of cases of child abuse just reopened after being ignored\/not investigated for years<br><br>Beech Brook and Murtis Taylor are very short distance from Great Lakes which means children could be trafficked to Canada, New York, and through to the Atlantic Ocean<br><br>2 pastors arrested days ago in this county for child trafficking\/child sex abuse.<br><br>One of the pastors wives works for the government for CPS type agency<br><br>...and lots of other shit i found out too but thats all i can remember right now, but like i said, there is a lot more fuckery i dug up.<br><br>Theres definitely more to this story than meets the eye.<br><br>Why do you think Stephens kept on and kept on and kept on mentioning Joy Lane, Murtis Taylor, and Beech Brook?<br><br>Why do you think he said to let his boss know he wouldn\u2019t be at work the next day he posted, \u201cI\u2019m

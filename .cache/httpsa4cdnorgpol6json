Made me realize that I had been taking Communion unworthily and giving incomplete confessions for several years. I fortunately learned and basically did a general confession (looking back at that moment) with the priest who showed me my errors. Since then I will only receive in a state of grace. It bugs me that people not in a state of grace are still getting Communion, my family included, but my voice does not get heard or even respected. I couldn&#039;t bring the college religious friends\/groups support with me once I graduated. The hierarchy has become more incompetent by the year, the subversion hasn&#039;t stopped one bit, the funds are still going to questionable charities, the parish left me spiritually malnourished, the family is culturally Catholic but the hypocrisy keeps the situation from improving, and nearly one year from my graduation I find myself becoming a more jobless and godless shut-in man who finds myself practicing it less and less but knows better than to commit sacrilege. <br><br>Still regard it as Truth despite the predicament that is my own hypocritical spiritual state.

A lot of them seem to smugly laugh at us and say how stupid we all are. Is that true? Or are they just envious? A part of me feels like a lot of them want their very own Trump but they&#039;re too ashamed to admit it. Or maybe social democracy has warped their perception of government-overreach. It&#039;s annoying how they seem to think Americans are foolish for not wanting to socialize everything.","filename":"Great_Seal_of_the_United_States_(obverse).svg","ext":".png","w":600,"h":600,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490589948341,"time":1490589948,"md5":"PsIpczqG2zkTWSng4LehSw==","fsize":276155,"resto":0,"id":"cuG5jaLa","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"why-do-europeans-hate-us-so-much-a-lot-of-them","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":1},{"no":118473289,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)00:51:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118472741\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118472741<\/a><br>being a German visiting the US i must say that you people are absolutely disgusting and your cities are uncultured wastelands with no culture, also you guys have a serious Nigger\/ Mexican problem","filename":"1475742137899","ext":".png","w":500,"h":552,"tn_w":113,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490590287332,"time":1490590287,"md5":"jiNbPwkmr5vLmopq6KTUmQ==","fsize":99924,"resto":118472741,"id":"URTld8v1","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118474955,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)01:08:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118473289\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118473289<\/a><br><br>Thats why we elected Trump and yet Euros seem to hate us even more for it","time":1490591334,"resto":118472741,"id":"cuG5jaLa","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118471065,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)00:28:58","name":"Anonymous","sub":"How Will Jews Survive After Whites are Gone?","com":"After European countries become majority Muslim\/black, the invaders will genocide the remaining whites.<br>They have no intention of coexisting peacefully with whites.<br>If whites are exterminated, how will Jews survive?

As fetuses develop, all are outfitted with the anatomical precursors to nipples, although they only offer a direct reproductive advantage to women for feeding their babies. But since that&#039;s such a favorable trait, evolution didn&#039;t go to the painstaking trouble of weeding nipples out of the male population. In other words, men have nipples because women do. Likewise, clitoral and penile tissues are borne of the same embryological stuff, developing into one or the other once biological sex traits set in. The hooded glans, packed with 8,000 nerve endings, is just the visible tip of the internal clitoral structure that extends up and around the vagina and engorges during arousal much like the penis [source: Gonzalez]. Therefore, female orgasms could exist because that clitoral anatomy was under no evolutionary pressure to disappear.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;http:\/\/health.howstuffworks.com\/se<wbr>xual-health\/sexuality\/orgasm4.htm<\/span><br><br>Thoughts?","filename":"Female-Oshot-Pleasure-Orgasm-570x400","ext":".jpg","w":570,"h":400,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":175,"tim":1490588222045,"time":1490588222,"md5":"BonBjzzes4fjJS5SapcDbw==","fsize":33495,"resto":0,"id":"NxYLY4mH","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"female-orgasm-nothing-more-than-a-byproduct-or","country_name":"United States","replies":14,"images":1,"omitted_posts":9,"omitted_images":1},{"no":118474678,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)01:06:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118469869\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118469869<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;studies prove female orgasms increase fertility<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;are largely psycho-stimulated<\/span>","time":1490591163,"resto":118469869,"id":"sEXHSdQ1","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118474847,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)01:07:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118474678\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118474678<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;studies prove female orgasms increase fertility<\/span><br><br>No they don&#039;t.

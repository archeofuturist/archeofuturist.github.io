Here&#039;s what must happen for us to recover the West: 1) The West must collapse, purified and rebuilt; 2) A revolutionary movement must overthrow the current order to establish a more conservative or traditionalist society - in which the role of women is well defined, in which religion is a part of our lives, in which race and culture are understood as inextricably linked and essential to the health of a nation. <br><br>Reform is a third option, and I hardly believe it is an option, because reform means working inside the current system, and we simply cannot work inside the current system. That&#039;s why Trump&#039;s Presidency is and will continue to be massive ineffective. Right now, Paul Ryan is essentially controlling the country. Paul Ryan&#039;s agenda is being carried out first and foremost. What is Paul Ryan&#039;s agenda? Healthcare (Ryan-care, wrongly referred to as &#039;Trump-care,&#039; which just failed in the House) and taxes. This is corporatism. What is the Congress not considering right now? A ban on Muslims, restrictions on immigration, deportations, and the renegotiation on our harmful trade deals. And we likely will not get any of these things, because Paul Ryan doesn&#039;t want them, because Trump doesn&#039;t have any power in this system, which is doing everything it can to stop him, and because Republicans are basically Democrats. The Republicans have the House, Senate, and Presidency, and still can&#039;t govern. <br><br>So, to remind you, it&#039;s collapse or it&#039;s revolution. That&#039;s it. If not, I hope you enjoy President Paul Ryan.","filename":"PresidentPaulRyan","ext":".jpg","w":768,"h":432,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1490914850888,"time":1490914850,"md5":"XDuNXPVRdNt8pgl0WIKBbA==","fsize":103711,"resto":0,"id":"51xTEsA9","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"its-time-to-abandon-trump","country_name":"United States","replies":17,"images":4,"omitted_posts":12,"omitted_images":4},{"no":118985072,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)19:16:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118984719\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118984719<\/a><br><br>Traditionalist want the same, you fucking retard. &quot;Collapse, purified and rebuilt&quot; is extremely broad, knuckle-dragger. <br><br>Look how dogmatic you fucking retards are. &#039;Whoa, Trump criticism!

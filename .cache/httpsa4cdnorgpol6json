The Whole World Is Now a Message Board","com":"For most of last year, it was hard to avoid the sensation that something had broken somewhere and the internet was leaking into real life. The world seemed to have taken on the punchy, disorderly, darkly playful quality of a message-board fight, in part because the president-to-be insisted on communicating mainly in tweets assembled from detritus found in a Breitbart-comments scrapyard. The subcultures and folkways of the internet had become powerful enough that the entire election apparatus was obligated to attend to and dissect them. In January, the Republican consultant Rick Wilson dismissed a portion of Trump supporters as \u201cchildless single men who masturbate to anime\u201d; by September, the Clinton campaign was concerned enough with the threat of meme warfare that itreleasedan explainer denouncing the cartoon frog Pepe under the title \u201cDonald Trump, Pepe the frog, and white supremacists: an explainer.\u201d When Election Night rolled around, it was hard to begrudge the exuberant 4chan poster, thrilling in his candidate\u2019s surprise victory, who bragged that \u201cwe actually elected a meme as president.\u201d<br><br>It was a shocking turn, and not just because Donald Trump had become president. Somehow the self-proclaimed losers and freaks of 4chan and its ilk had come to great political prominence. The gleaming new real-name internet of Facebook \u2014 not to mention the media companies and political machines relying on it \u2014 that was supposed to tame the wild territory of the Reddit-style web had instead been infected by it. It was almost a thrilling underdog story \u2014 the weirdos and outcasts had stood up for something and won \u2014 except that the thing they were standing up for was anti-Enlightenment, anti-democratic, anti-equality politics.<br><br>http:\/\/nymag.com\/selectall\/2017\/04\/<wbr>the-whole-world-is-now-a-message-bo<wbr>ard.html","filename":"Screenshot_2017-05-01-09-09-25_1","ext":".jpg","w":1080,"h":1438,"tn_w":187,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493604861732,"time":1493604861,"md5":"tUm5sxVkFzya4c8taZoFgA==","fsize":123965,"resto":0,"id":"zPWE4BqR","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"what-have-you-done-pol-the-whole-world-is-now-a","country_name":"United States","replies":18,"images":3,"omitted_posts":13,"omitted_images":1},{"no":123566189,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)22:38:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123565779\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123565779<\/a><br>It&#039;s so beautiful.","time":1493606332,"resto":123563171,"id":"cI\/w19BX","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123566508,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)22:41:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"Thanks for the new Pepe portrait","time":1493606483,"resto":123563171,"id":"V1Qm6B\/j","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123566763,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)22:43:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123565373\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123565373<\/a><br>Can I get a quick rundown on this?","time":1493606619,"resto":123563171,"id":"9CoHdQFk","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123567365,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)22:49:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"If talking shit to someone on social media is violence then isn&#039;t deleting an account like murder?

Pretty much all of the Christian sources I&#039;ve listened to over the years are of the Meek and Mild ChristCuck variety as that&#039;s what seems to be insanely popular in America right now. However, that&#039;s such a disservice as we know that virtues such as Honesty, Morality, Loyalty, Respect, and Family are fundamental pillars to NatSoc and Christianity heavily emphasizes such teachings but is often glossed over for more feminine, &quot;safe&quot; teachings in order to appeal to larger audiences.<br><br>I&#039;m tired of the Cucks that unemotionally beat around the bush, clergy that are clearly extorting their crowd for profit and care only for numbers, and pastors that try to sound profound pulling messages and sermons out of passages just because. All of the required reading and prominent traditional Alt-Right material has been fine up until this point and probably still will be for some time, but I wonder if there&#039;s anyone, or even an entire church, that fills this specific nich\u00e9 yet?

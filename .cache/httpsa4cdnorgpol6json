Then you move to the ranch, and you can claim a piece of land giving to the company-town hall the amount of coins that matches with the square meters you have claimed. These coins are then destroyed by sending them to a bogus coin address so actually records the transaction. Coins are never extracted from this address and for this matter, there is no private key (This can be done). <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;So, if investors cannot use coins to actually settle (because they are not elegible to apply) what can they do with these coins?

Since the pharaos and probably before the rulers memed how they are all powerfull with the might of god aiding them. For that reason they let themselves get carried around, built huge castles, have huge military parades, all to meme they have power to vanquish everything opposing them. That goes on until the invention of the nukes. From then on detterence became controll as the nuke, the ultimate deterrence, could be memed by the enemies too and not be surpassed so far. They now meme how they controll media, letteragencies, education, economy, when in reality its the memes upholding their power. There are only so few with actual ill intent, the rest just follow because the memes work and they feel like they cant change anything either way since they controll everything. If the memes stop working all of the establishment would collapse as even those inside of it mostly only support it out of lack of alternatives or obliviousness.

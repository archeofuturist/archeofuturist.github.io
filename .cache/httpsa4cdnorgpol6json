Hidden cures for cancer and the secrets of zero-point energy that had been suppressed by the Clinton, Bush and Obama presidencies changed the face of the planet. Healthcare no longer became an issue, as all the diseases and sickness of the world were eradicated. The corrupt religion of Islam collapsed and state sponsored terrorism was eviscerated as the nation\u2019s formerly known as Saudi Arabia, Iran, and the OPEC cartel collapsed as oil became worthless in a new free energy society. \u201c Barron lifted his golden handkerchief from his pocket to wipe the tears from his face.

Those fucking hats.<br>\u201cI remember,\u201d he chuckled, when I was just 10 or 11 years old, I saw in the early days of my father\u2019s campaign, right there in the audience. This old gentleman, he had to be in his 60\u2019s had this beautiful red hat. I thought my father made them as a joke. What presidential candidate wears a red trucker hat? He screamed at my father, \u201cLOCK HER UP\u201d. I spent that night browsing the web, and quickly realized how we could win this election. I told my father that I couldn\u2019t tour with him, that I had to meme. I shopped that damn hat on a couple frogs, you guys now know him as Pepe, the great symbol of peace. I joined hundreds of thousand other meme warriors to do something that had never been done before. We won an election, took down the corrupt establishment, with the internet. It was hard to describe what that felt like, it was hard to understand what this meant for the world. That a few \u201cPedes\u201d as we were called, could take down the Clinton Cartel, which was later discovered to the the largest money laundering and child trafficking organization in history, by actually becoming the News.\u201d","time":1490906935,"resto":118964916,"id":"XPh7o2p9","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118967495,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)16:56:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118964916\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118964916<\/a><br>Muslim here, with a message for all the cumskins on this board: <br><br>It was you who divided up the land.<br><br>It was you who put in the puppet governments.<br><br>It was you who built the oil wells on Muslim holy lands.<br><br>It was you who allowed the Jews to exterminate and enslave the Palestinians.<br><br>It was you who played geopolitical games with Iraq and Iran during their war.<br><br>It was you who gave Saddam chemical weapons.<br><br>It was you who caused the Ayatollah to come into power in Iran.<br><br>It was you who created the Mujaheddin, Osama Bin Laden, and Al Qaeda.<br><br>It was you who killed 1 million children with your economic sanctions on Iraq.<br><br>It was you who, with your gluttonous oil consumption, gave power to Saudi Arabia and turned a blind eye to their funding of Wahhabi extremism.<br><br>It was you who abused the Arab world so much that they felt they had to attack your soil on 9\/11.<br><br>It was you who started an endless massacre across all of Afghanistan in retaliation against a small group that lived there.<br><br>It was you who invaded Iraq unprovoked, destroyed it&#039;s infrastructure, massacred it&#039;s people, and left it in shambles in your wake.<br><br>It was you who covertly ignited civil wars in Libya and Syria because it suited your geopolitical interests, only to let the bloodbaths stagnate when your goals failed.<br><br>It was you who not only caused ISIS to exist, but allowed them to grow like a cancer unchecked.<br><br>It was jouz who destroyed the lives of millions of Arabs and forced them to leave their homeland.<br><br>You are the cause of all of this.

I personally see it as some sort of unholy mixture between the Old Regime and post-Napoleonic modern statism. Here&#039;s the thing: bad kings happen, history is full of them. But under traditional monarchy there were plenty of checks and balances to keep things more or less working.<br><br>The most important of these checks was the aristocracy: they were the actual owners of the land, not the crown. If the monarch went bad, aristocrats would revolt and try to either secede or claim the crown for themselves. The monarch was nothing without noble support, and the nobles gained legitimacy by supporting a respected crown.<br><br>Another factor was the Church. The power of the Pope was nothing to laugh at and only the most powerful kings dared to stand up against the Church. This seems funny nowadays, but back then a word from the Pope meant half your kingdom went up in flames by enraged Catholics.<br><br>A enlightened monarchy gets rid of all those checks and balances and leaves you in the hands of a despot, not a monarch.<br><br>Constitutional monarchism is a charade, a sham. A monarch under such political system is nothing but either a puppet of the state or a public figure not much different to the Reality TV celebrities that plague media. We monarchist don&#039;t just want a king, we want the feudal system back. Not out of romanticism, but out of respect to our own nature.

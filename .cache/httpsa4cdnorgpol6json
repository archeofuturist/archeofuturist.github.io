There are some places in the world like Russia, Europe, Japan which have been more or less homogenous. America has not been as homogenous as these places.<br><br>But America is unique in all of human history for being a nation founded on an idea, on an ideology and attracting different cultures\/ethnicities (even from Europe) to that idea. While there should be sufficient vetting to make sure people actually believe in American values and follow laws, America defines itself by the American ideology and culture.<br><br>If you want to say whites are being disadvantaged in todays society due to affirmative action, SJWs, lack of healthcare or lack of paid family leave, then by all means fight those fights, establish those programs. Just don&#039;t pass off &quot;America for the Americans&quot; as an ethnic rallying cry.","time":1492819577,"resto":122174668,"id":"e04Lu4cy","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122207155,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)20:11:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122206367\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122206367<\/a><br>Just Google highest paid ethic group","time":1492819882,"resto":122174668,"id":"atwX7Iwc","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122207403,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)20:13:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122197716\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122197716<\/a><br>I am not saying India&#039;s a good country by any means.

What they have in common is they use superheroes or popular characters like peppa or spongebob, they involve fighting, shitting, farting and killing, they have tens of millions of views and thousands of automatically generated comments and responses.

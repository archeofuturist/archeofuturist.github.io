There were barriers to knowledge which prevented people from faking it. Now people&#039;s grandmothers are posting memes on Facebook.<br>Back in the early 60s there was a show called Route 66 that was filmed on location throughout the United States and Canada.

Back in 1960, a small town in New Mexico was very different culturally from a shrimping town on the Gulf, a dam project on the Colorado, or a logging camp in the Pacific Northwest. Even getting to such places could be an adventure. &quot;Now you can go anywhere you want,&quot; Maharis concluded, &quot;and it&#039;s a Denny&#039;s.&quot;<\/span><br>Organic culture is being replaced with a manufactured culture.","time":1491729676,"resto":120257446,"id":"7Ap0ltFb","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120263608,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)05:27:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120261770\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120261770<\/a><br>Hard to describe how but I think people were more real.

I&#039;m not from here, I left my country years ago. Back in the 70s there were large groups of people who traveled around the country. Probably a hippie throwback from the 60s. You could disappear as an adult in these groups. And anything went. Drugs, sex, anything and everything. They were concentrated in more liberal areas where police and other authorities let us be. Or got favors from us. Literally tens of thousands of people lived like this. And us kids where treated as a commodity and used as currency. For instance a guy with mechanic skills could go into a commune for a few weeks. Fix everyones vehicles, and get paid in everything from peyote, food and nightly blowjobs from various kids. Then move on and disappear to another group. I&#039;m certain the world knew this was going on and accepted it as part of that world. The 70s was a pedo paradise. I remember when I was about 8 or 9 a woman joined our group for the night she was a smoking hot Comanche or some shit. She paid a lot of interest in me and was real sweet, and I has excited AF because I thought &#039;great, I&#039;m gonna get to screw her.&#039; That night all the adults are smoking up and my parents ended up kicking me out of the room so they could fuck her. I was so pissed, apart from a feel of her boobs I never saw any action. What part of all that isn&#039;t totally fucked up. That couldn&#039;t happen today, or at least not to the extent it took place back then.<br><br>So, in conclusion, there was a huge section of the 70s that was massively bluepilled.","time":1491730068,"resto":120257446,"id":"4sH1NrwR","country":"NZ","country_name":"New Zealand"},{"no":120266203,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)06:02:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120258264\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120258264<\/a><br>you pathetic human-niggers amuse me with your meaningless segregation of culture into an arbitrary unit of time that is infinitesimal","time":1491732138,"resto":120257446,"id":"XO7yMjJw","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120266341,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)06:04:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120263608\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120263608<\/a><br>look at this faggot. he&#039;s writing fiction and gets sexually aroused from it","time":1491732255,"resto":120257446,"id":"XO7yMjJw","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120266642,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)06:08:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120257509\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120257509<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;1993<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;brady bill was enacted<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;introduced by Chuck Schumer<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;redpilled<\/span><br><br>yeah nah","time":1491732496,"resto":120257446,"id":"KibzXMXs","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":120225098,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)22:44:21","name":"Anonymous","sub":"CAR PLOUGHS INTO CROWD IN BROOKLYN","com":"TRUCK OF PEACE COMES TO USA<br><br>CAR OF TOLERANCE EDITION<br><br>https:\/\/twitter.com\/Breaking911\/sta<wbr>tus\/85089945688312627244<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;BREAKING: 1 dead, at least 5 others injured after car plows into pedestrians in Brownsville, Brooklyn - WABC<\/span>","filename":"news","ext":".jpg","w":300,"h":168,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1491705861862,"time":1491705861,"md5":"DddSrMnn+NGjp3Cqz2FEdA==","fsize":9380,"resto":0,"id":"SfzuVXB8","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"car-ploughs-into-crowd-in-brooklyn","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":232,"images":61,"omitted_posts":227,"omitted_images":60,"tail_size":50},{"no":120261631,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)05:01:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;The rollerblades flew off the man&#039;s feet and smashed a van&#039;s window.<\/span>","filename":"rollerball","ext":".jpg","w":825,"h":464,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1491728472155,"time":1491728472,"md5":"l0rEJ08OxAWxQ4XfnJyFOg==","fsize":47242,"resto":120225098,"id":"C2iZQxsr","country":"SI","country_name":"Slovenia"},{"no":120263855,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)05:31:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120225225\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120225225<\/a><br>HOW????","time":1491730261,"resto":120225098,"id":"sWiOAfnf","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120264325,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)05:37:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120225098\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120225098<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Brooklyn <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;deaths<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;good <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;prob Jews <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;#FireKushner <\/span><br><br>:)","time":1491730634,"resto":120225098,"id":"+GQI41tT","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120264836,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)05:44:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120225225\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120225225<\/a><br><br>A white nationalist?

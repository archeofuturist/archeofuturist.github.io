It needn&#039;t be properly weaponized. Rebels have been known to use that stuff throughout the years and they don&#039;t hesitate to use it as much as you think. Even a literal retard can prepare chlorine gas and there are videos of rebel labs (~2-3 years ago) testing them. Even the Canadian military has taken into consideration the use of chemical weapons by rebels in its reservation to shy away from Iraq. It&#039;s a real thing.

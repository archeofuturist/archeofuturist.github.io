She tried to reach to her friend multiple times as if not being able to understand the situation, but the Sunni girl&#039;s social media was basically non-stop hate toward non-Sunnis.

It has happened in Syria where neighboring Sunnis promise to look after the Christians&#039; stuff when they have to flee, and when things calm down and the Christian families return, they are no longer able to get in their own houses and apartments and are treated like they had never existed.

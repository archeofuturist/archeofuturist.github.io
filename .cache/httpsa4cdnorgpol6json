There is no such thing as mind-independent, objective emergent properties, in the same way there is no such thing as mind-independent, objective information. Only the mind gives these things meaning. The mind exists; this is self-evident. Thus the mind isn&#039;t an emergent property. Thus the mind can&#039;t be produced by matter. Thus the mind is immaterial. Computers can&#039;t produce immaterial things. Thus computers can&#039;t produce minds.<br><br>It can be deduced, not just induced, that matter cannot produce consciousness, because there is no such objective thing as &quot;emergent properties.&quot; An electron, or any number of electrons, passing between any number of points, in any permutation, through any combination or permutation of mediums, cannot produce consciousness, because of the simple fact that matter is never objectively more than its parts.<br><br>The mind necessarily precedes quantification. Without it, no computation even has any meaning.<br><br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Chine<wbr>se_room","filename":"ai_0[1]","ext":".jpg","w":1500,"h":1000,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1490056148305,"time":1490056148,"md5":"\/GPI+dljJl5kv4rnhX9ANg==","fsize":157387,"resto":0,"id":"cTaquhJA","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"there-is-no-such-thing-nor-can-there-be-any-such","country_name":"United States","replies":27,"images":2,"omitted_posts":22,"omitted_images":2},{"no":117565864,"now":"03\/20\/17(Mon)21:24:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"memory<br>some per-programed &quot;instincts&quot;<br>capacity to learn<br><br>and some pushing for speed up of consciousness","time":1490059449,"resto":117558820,"id":"X7xHTHct","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117565881,"now":"03\/20\/17(Mon)21:24:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117565702\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117565702<\/a><br><br>He was just going to the beach, he didn&#039;t even want those cookies.","time":1490059456,"resto":117558820,"id":"d+dChYi6","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117566177,"now":"03\/20\/17(Mon)21:26:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117558820\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117558820<\/a><br><br>Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. <br><br>Arthur C.

Am I to believe he&#039;s making it up?","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;I come from Arta, a small city in northern Greece. It happened on Saturday, March 25, 1944. We had just lit the candles to celebrate the Sabbath when an SS officer and a Greek policeman burst into the house. They told us we should get ourselves ready for a big trip.&quot;<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The 85-year-old slides the sleeve of his shirt up and uncovers his left forearm. The number 182558 is tattooed there in dark-blue ink.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The transport to Auschwitz took two weeks. His sick father died on the journey. Upon arrival, they had to strip and submit to an inspection. Ganon&#039;s mother and five siblings were then sent to the gas chambers.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Yitzhak Ganon was taken to the Auschwitz-Birkenau hospital, where Josef Mengele, the so-called &quot;Angel of Death,&quot; conducted grisly experiments on Jewish prisoners.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Ganon had to lie down on a table and was tied down. Without any anesthetics, Mengele cut him open and removed his kidney. &quot;I saw the kidney pulsing in his hand and cried like a crazy man,&quot; Ganon says. &quot;I screamed the &#039;Shema Yisrael.&#039; I begged for death, to stop the suffering.&quot;<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;After the &quot;operation,&quot; he had to work in the Auschwitz sewing room without painkillers. Among other things, he had to clean bloody medical instruments. Once, he had to spend the whole night in a bath of ice-cold water because Mengele wanted to &quot;test&quot; his lung function. Altogether, Ganon spent six and a half months in the concentration camp&#039;s hospital.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;When they had no more use for him, the Nazis sent him to the gas chamber. He survived only by chance: The gas chamber held only 200 people. Ganon was number 201.<\/span><br><br>http:\/\/spiegel.de\/international\/wor<wbr>ld\/a-666327.html","filename":"IMG_1815","ext":".jpg","w":860,"h":602,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":175,"tim":1490057865319,"time":1490057865,"md5":"lCBAn2UZOrzJBF7i8Ov1uw==","fsize":59270,"resto":0,"id":"tQEcypAw","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"his-family-were-gassed-and-his-kidney-was-cut-out","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":68,"images":10,"omitted_posts":63,"omitted_images":10},{"no":117567605,"now":"03\/20\/17(Mon)21:38:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117562553\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117562553<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Yitzhak Ganon was taken to the Auschwitz-Birkenau hospital<\/span><br>So there was a hospital too","time":1490060323,"resto":117562553,"id":"vPpcGA0S","country":"NZ","country_name":"New Zealand"},{"no":117567775,"now":"03\/20\/17(Mon)21:40:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117564916\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117564916<\/a><br>Manpower already expended to round up into trains, more manpower to guard.

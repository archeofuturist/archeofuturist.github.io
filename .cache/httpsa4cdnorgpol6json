I&#039;m tall, actually moderately attractive, with a state job making ~145k a year in tech. I currently spend most of time free time reading, playing video games, working out, and cooking. Over the last 5 years or so I have slowly lost my desire for any kind of relationship with women. <br><br>I was not really a Chad, but I was one of the lucky few who was getting laid pretty steadily in high school, and on through college and my early adult life. I had my heart broken, and I broke some hearts. But the last 5 years I have really found the company of women in general to be less and less tolerable. Most of them want to talk about the same old boring shit. Whats on TV\/Movies\/Social Justice\/Whatever dumb hobby they&#039;re into. Given I live in a liberal infested shithole, it just seems like I can&#039;t find a single woman out there who brings any kind of excitement to the table anymore. Even the ones where politics is never brought up once. I don&#039;t drink often at all, not into the party scene. I despise degeneracy in general. I&#039;ve just gotten to the point where I&#039;m giving up hope on finding a decent companion, ya know? I can deal with it. Really, pussy is great and all, but it has seriously come to the point where I don&#039;t see it worth the effort of going through the motions of picking up women. Its like the same shit on repeat. Fuck it, I&#039;d rather just beat my meat in the shower every once in a while and call it even. <br><br>Given my growing apathy toward women in general, I&#039;ve come to question if this is strictly internal, or if the direction society is going is attributing to it. I didn&#039;t used to feel this way, but that was 5 years ago, before SJW, Cultural-marxism, and Socialism was mainstream. I see these &#039;anti-values&#039; reflected in the women I meet and it sickens me.<br><br>What does \/pol\/ think? Is society causing otherwise valuable males to drop out, and if so, how do we fix it, or am I just fucked in the head?","filename":"Going_alone","ext":".jpg","w":700,"h":465,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1492567023156,"time":1492567023,"md5":"rCRUXoxcriU8GLVGpF29OQ==","fsize":37872,"resto":0,"id":"9eSNTXku","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"am-i-the-problem-or-is-it-society","country_name":"United States","replies":210,"images":38,"omitted_posts":205,"omitted_images":37,"tail_size":50},{"no":121803786,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)00:50:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121801642\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121801642<\/a><br>sadly, men will set up woman as a scapegoat for his own failures and insecurities. and its quite an easy thing to do because every human entity has a flaw which can be harped upon.<br><br>in the same way the negroes blame whites<br>in the same way whites blame the jews<br>in the same way the poor blame the rich<br><br>for in a society of people who insatiably loves themselves it is so easy and seductive to find a scapegoat to hurl upon all the responsibility of their own personal flaws and shortcomings. in fact its very alleviating.","time":1492577403,"resto":121782238,"id":"O5+ifRgx","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121803984,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)00:51:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121803786\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121803786<\/a><br><br>sadly open members of the cult will be killed","time":1492577499,"resto":121782238,"id":"Ne7GOXER","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121804093,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)00:52:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121786641\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121786641<\/a><br>This.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Be me<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Landed a patent attorney traineeship<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Consider myself crazy lucky<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Will make 35000 euro a year<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Maybe double that in a very, very long time<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Read about everyone on \/pol\/ earning well over 6 figures<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Want to revaluate my choices in life, but can&#039;t see how I could have done much better<\/span><br>Nevertheless, good for you all.

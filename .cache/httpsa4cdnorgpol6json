Consider these points:<br><br>1. Not a single country that is currently experiencing Antifa riots is a fascist country. <br>2. Not a single country that is currently experiencing Antifa riots has any likelihood of becoming a fascist country under current leadership or policy. <br>3. Every country that is currently experiencing Antifa riots have a vocal right wing calling for the Antifa organization to be considered a terrorist organization. <br>4. Inclusion of an organization opposed to &quot;fascism&quot; onto a listing of terrorist organizations opens the door to &quot;anti-fascist&quot; organizations to be labeled as terrorist organizations. <br>5. Antifa has obvious ties to George Soros. <br>6. George Soros has obvious ties to organizations that have committed regime over throws in other countries. <br>7. Antifa, and by extension its founders and supporters, protest fascism while at the same time propping up fascist ideals.<br>8. When a truly fascist leader does attempt to take power, the groups and its backers associated with the current anti-fascist movement will be the ones that see the gain. <br>9. The right wing opponents of Antifa will be the outsiders in a truly fascist regime. <br>10. If anti-fascist protest groups are considered terrorist organizations, then when a truly fascist regime does come into power, those groups will be criminals against the state. <br><br>Obviously a truly fascist regime would not be labeled as such by the MSM, and of course the leader of that group would not campaign on that platform. Furthermore, we wouldn&#039;t even necessarily realize the true extent of the situation until the regime is in place. Are we being set up? Is this a plan that has been in the works? Could Trump be a pawn in a bigger game of 4D chess? While I completely agree that Antifa is a terrorist organization, I also recognize how important it is to look at the implications of our current situation. Is a change in strategy in order?

MUH GUNS doesn&#039;t really mean much of shit when the guys with the droney planes are making the moves that make your country and state a shit crater. Ten years ago the area I live in was white for the most part with some blacks, now I can&#039;t go to the store for a refreshing ginger ale without seeing a dozen illegals and their brain dead offspring farting about like shit colored feral animals, spending hundreds of imaginary food stamp bucks while not integrating whatsoever. It&#039;s bleak, and even if Trump wasn&#039;t full of shit I doubt much could be done to get back to a status quo. The less immigration since he took office is just horse shit, if there&#039;s less immigration it&#039;s because all of the immigrants that wanted to come here are already here. Deporting 10 or 12 pacos and greasaritas here and there does fuck all in the big picture. They&#039;ve essentially transported, funded and provided for an entire group of people who give zero shits about any of us or our nation, will never give back, and will continue getting the free ride of a lifetime. I imagine it&#039;s similar to the &quot;refugee&quot; crisis in places like Sweden and Germany, just more of a slower death for us. It all happened so fast, and I can&#039;t get used to it. Whenever I see them and stare down into their black ignorant four foot nine eyes I just want to spit on them and throw them into a trash can where they belong. The only real way out of it for a white person that doesn&#039;t want to be around it is a gated community or go to a place that hasn&#039;t been overrun yet.

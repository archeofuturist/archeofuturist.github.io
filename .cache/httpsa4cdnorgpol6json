I hadn&#039;t spoke to him in months, because I was 1500 miles away, and I just so happen to call on his first attempt. He was shooting up in his bathroom and his father ended up saving his life. As coincidental as it sounds I just so happen to call a week later on his second attempt, and on his third he succeeded. He was the only man I knew that I could trust to fight by my side in war on our homeland. He was one you&#039;d never expect to start using heroin, but it happened. <br><br>He told me on his first attempt he was surrounded by demons and darkness, their voices wer horrid and grotesque, but all of a sudden the light came and blew out their voices completely and they were nowhere to be found. In the light he could see a gigantic hand reach out for his hand. It was a massive angel clad in golden armor and it was the most beautiful face of a man he had ever seen. Just as he was about to touch his hand he woke. I don&#039;t remember if the angel spoke to him, but IIRC he said nothing. <br><br>One of the strangest things about the whole situation was he was approached by satan, months or a couple years prior, in his dreams twice and IIRC he asked him if he sold his soul to him accidentally and satan laughed. He had recently took a job making 250k a year and he questioned himself if he&#039;d sold his soul accidentally for the money or the fact that he chose money over his life, seeing as it was the third most dangerous job in the world.

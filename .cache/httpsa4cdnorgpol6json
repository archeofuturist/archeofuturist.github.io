Here&#039;s why: <br><br>1. Seth was the Voter Expansion Data Director at the DNC, which means that he would have had access to the computers that the DNC\u2019s emails were on. <br><br>2. Everything about his murder on June 10th, 2016, is fishy. At 4:20 AM, Rich was about a block away from his house in D.C., when he was shot twice in the back by two men dressed in all black. Newsweek reported that police said he may have been killed in an attempted robbery, but the shooters didn&#039;t take his watch, wallet, phone that he was actively talking on when he got shot, or gold necklace. <br><br>3. In fact, the police reported that they found him conscious, which would mean that the shooters didn\u2019t even go near the body. However this contradicts with the fact that Rich&#039;s girlfriend told NBC Washington, &quot;There had been a struggle. His hands were bruised, his knees are bruised, his face is bruised, and yet he had two shots to his back, and yet they never took anything...They didn&#039;t finish robbing him, they just took his life.&quot; The police closed the case, calling it a \u201cbotched robbery.\u201d The police have a surveillance tape that they claim gives a glimpse of his killers\u2019 legs, but they have declined to show this tape to the parents or to the public. <br><br>4. Wikileaks seems to hint that Seth Rich was their source. Wikileaks revealed that the leaked emails came from a Bernie Sanders supporter who was frustrated that the DNC rigged the primaries for Hillary Clinton, which fits with Seth Rich\u2019s persona. In August 2016, WikiLeaks offered a $20,000 reward for information leading to a conviction. During an interview with a Dutch television station, Assange brought up Seth Rich and stated, \u201cour sources, ah, take risks, and they, they become concerned to see things occurring like that.\u201d He then neither confirmed, nor denied, that Rich was their leaker.","filename":"36C83CC200000578-0-image-a-1_1470071579344","ext":".jpg","w":634,"h":634,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492664025200,"time":1492664025,"md5":"\/489dMWI2ja0dMq4PKVydg==","fsize":60874,"resto":0,"id":"5gmdZYiD","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"his-name-was-seth-rich","country_name":"United States","replies":5,"images":1},{"no":121954452,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)00:53:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121954425\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121954425<\/a><br>5.

Leaked messages between \u201cGuccifer 2.0\u201d and a female actor revealed that Guccifer source\u2019s name was \u201cSeth\u201d.<br><br>6.

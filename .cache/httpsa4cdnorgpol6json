There may be reproductive advantages being a male rapist, and so there are potential advantages being the rapist son of a rapist. However, for a woman, rape is theft of one of her valuable possessions, her reproductive choice. She has to carry a parasite for 9 months and then care for it for nearly two decades, and even more if her child is a NEET robot, so it&#039;s in her interests to guard herself and be picky about whose genes she&#039;s willing to devote so much of her life to. If she has a husband, then it&#039;s a theft of his reproductive vessel as he has been the one to invest himself in her future fertility, while some other asshole came along and took it by force.<br><br>Humans create societies which have large impacts on both sexual and natural selection. Living in denser societies necessitates concepts like impartial and retributive justice to punish the aggressive, violent, and exploitative. We&#039;ve domesticated ourselves and are now far less violent than our Paleolithic ancestors. The longer a culture has lived in urban societies, then the more domesticated it is, which is why Chinese people are tame and commit very little violent crime and why sub-Saharan Africans are aggressive and prone to crime. We have the ability to shape what our societies select for, and it&#039;s in the interests of everyone except for potential rapists to continue punishing and deterring further rape. <br><br>Women are smaller than men because their reproductive success depends more upon their fertility, whereas for men it depends more on their ability to compete with other men. Men are physically larger because of physical competition between men. Caucasoids are the most sexually dimorphic race and I suspect that part of the cultural success of Caucasoids may be related to a greater variability in the quality of males, leading to more shit men and more top tier men. Female choice is eugenic, rape is dysgenic.","time":1492122445,"resto":120968979,"id":"X+20Sx8H","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]},{"posts":[{"no":120972299,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)18:15:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"Can&#039;t the Americans fuck off<br>900 american soldiers<br><br>If you want war then just attack right now","filename":"Screenshot_2017-04-13-23-14-32","ext":".png","w":480,"h":800,"tn_w":150,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492121753909,"time":1492121753,"md5":"WVzbFADoFCXaQ0wX9et8aA==","fsize":207601,"resto":0,"id":"\/6hniMfg","country":"IE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"cant-the-americans-fuck-off","country_name":"Ireland","replies":21,"images":5,"omitted_posts":16,"omitted_images":5},{"no":120973504,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)18:24:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120972299\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120972299<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Kaliningrad <\/span><br>Who cares.<br>We&#039;ve got them covered from Litvu, too.","time":1492122284,"resto":120972299,"id":"gW5yVgqE","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120973581,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)18:25:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120973157\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120973157<\/a><br><a href=\"#p120973242\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120973242<\/a><br>Ohh yeah.

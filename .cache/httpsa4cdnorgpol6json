Socialism doesn&#039;t needs a lot of money to buy things, since everything costs much less. Inflation is a monetary trick, taxes are monarchy trick. Socialism fully controls its own money. There should be no foreign currencies in Socialism, there should be no foreign companies in Socialism. Million used to be a lot more, GDP doesn&#039;t applies to Socialism, since it&#039;s not part of international system. If i buy house in Socialism for 5000 Euro it won&#039;t be worth much at first capitalistic glance, but it might be worth more than your capitalistic million dollar house. Nowadays the worth of money and salaries of some region are decided by international elite, basically where they move their companies.

If both parents are Rh negative, then the child will be Rh negative for sure, but otherwise, it is possible for a child to be either Rh positive or negative. Also, while Rh negative is rare among non-Europeans, it is still a minority within the European population, so Rh-positive is not proof of non-European ancestry. It&#039;s called rhesus factor because scientists recognized its similarities to an antibody found in rhesus macaques, likely related to our common ancestry. The origins of Rh negative blood are unclear, but are likely due to a mutation occurring either in Europe or the Near East. <br><br><a href=\"#p121114425\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121114425<\/a><br>Most women could vote in both countries prior to WW2.

It seems that Eurasians had one period of significant Neanderthal admixture shortly after leaving Africa, but before diverging into separate Caucasoid and Mongoloid populations, and after the divergence, Mongoloids had a second major period of Neanderthal admixture. The geography would seem to prohibit this, but it could have been the result of an intermediary population that no longer exists. Say, a group of humans or hominids that bred significantly with Neanderthals, and then bred with the ancestors of Mongoloids but not Caucasoids. Similarly, Denisovan admixture is highest among Melanesians, and yet Denisovans were found in southwest Siberia, rather than southeast Asia.","time":1492206121,"resto":121105198,"id":"i199x7J2","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]},{"posts":[{"no":121118460,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)17:41:58","name":"Anonymous","sub":"what an evil racist","com":"How can he vamp up ICE to deport those innocent illegal immigrants!

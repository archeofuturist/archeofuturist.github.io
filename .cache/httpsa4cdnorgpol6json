When the Mohammedans at- <br>tempted to penetrate beyond France into Central Europe during the <br>eighth century, his visitors had told him, they had been driven back at <br>the Battle of Tours. Had the Arabs won this battle, the world would be <br>Mohammedan today. For theirs was a religion that believed in spreading <br>the faith by the sword and subjugating all nations to that faith. The <br>Germanic peoples would have become heirs to that religion. Such a creed <br>was perfectly suited to the Germanic temperament. Hitler said that the <br>conquering Arabs, because of their racial inferiority, would in the long <br>run have been unable to contend with the harsher climate and conditions <br>of the country. They could not have kept down the more vigorous natives, <br>so that ultimately not Arabs but Islamized Germans could have stood at <br>the head of this Mohammedan Empire. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Hitler usually concluded this historical speculation by remarking: <\/span><br>&quot;You see, it&#039;s been our misfortune to have the wrong religion. Why didn&#039;t <br>we have the religion of the Japanese, who regard sacrifice for the Father- <br>land as the highest good? The Mohammedan religion too would have <br>been much more compatible to us than Christianity. Why did it have to <br>be Christianity with its meekness and flabbiness?&quot; It is remarkable that <br>even before the war he sometimes went on: &quot;Today the Siberians, the <br>White Russians, and the people of the steppes live extremely healthy <br>lives. For that reason they are better equipped for development and in <br>the long run biologically superior to the Germans.&quot; This was an idea he <br>was destined to repeat in far more drastic tones during the last months <br>of the war. <br><br>what did he mean by this?<br><br>worth noting however that this is from Albert &quot;The Nazi who Cucked&quot; Speer","filename":"Bundesarchiv_Bild_146-1987-004-09A,_Amin_al_Husseini_und_Adolf_Hitler","ext":".jpg","w":792,"h":600,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":189,"tim":1491247392951,"time":1491247392,"md5":"wfvuuB5Nm+RJjx63dOMVHw==","fsize":57731,"resto":0,"id":"UCY3jiuD","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"hitler-had-been-much-impressed-by-a-scrap-of","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":1,"images":1},{"no":119368509,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)15:27:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119368000\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119368000<\/a><br><br>he&#039;s not wrong.

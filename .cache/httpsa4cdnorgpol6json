The Bible tells us when Woman has started puberty, Woman is ready. No \u201cage of consent\u201d is provided. We must abide God\u2019s word and follow His instructions. Woman is to obey and submit to Man. Woman shall not reject Man on any physical attribute Man does or does not possess. If Woman rejects Man for His appearance, He shall smite her across the jawline. Evil acts upon Man prevents the relationship and marriage. God wants Man and Woman to be together. As one in the flesh. Man is to care and protect Woman. Woman is to obey and serve Man. Cursed is the Woman who judges Man on his physical appearance. Her blood will be upon her. When the light is upon us, Woman will be at Home cleaning, cooking, and nurturing the Children. It will be very good. Remember, my Brothers, Woman is gift for Man from God. God is great. When darkness has arrived and Man is at the Home, he shall eat and spend time with Woman and Children. God is so great.<br><br>Let this be the New Man\u2019s Order. We must start now. We are living in a world full of degeneracy. Marriage rates are way down. Birth rates are way down.

Cameron had been hoping to correct schizophrenia by erasing existing memories and reprogramming the psyche. He commuted from Albany, New York, to Montreal every week to work at the Allan Memorial Institute of McGill University and was paid $69,000 from 1957 to 1964 ($543,100 in 2016 dollars) to carry out MKUltra experiments there. These research funds were sent to Dr. Cameron by a CIA front organization, the Society for the Investigation of Human Ecology, and as shown in internal CIA documents, Cameron did not know that the money originated from the CIA.[52] In addition to LSD, Cameron also experimented with various paralytic drugs as well as electroconvulsive therapy at thirty to forty times the normal power. His &quot;driving&quot; experiments consisted of putting subjects into drug-induced coma for weeks at a time (up to three months in one case) while playing tape loops of noise or simple repetitive statements. His experiments were typically carried out on patients who had entered the institute for minor problems such as anxiety disorders and postpartum depression, many of whom suffered permanently from his actions.[53] His treatments resulted in victims&#039; incontinence, amnesia, forgetting how to talk, forgetting their parents, and thinking their interrogators were their parents.[54] His work was inspired and paralleled by the British psychiatrist William Sargant at St Thomas&#039; Hospital, London, and Belmont Hospital, Surrey, who was also involved in the Intelligence Services and who experimented extensively on his patients without their consent, causing similar long-term damage.<\/span>","time":1490675826,"resto":118604871,"id":"CQ5m5bDb","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118611502,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)00:39:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118611281\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118611281<\/a><br>2 of 2<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Naomi Klein argues in her book The Shock Doctrine that Cameron&#039;s research and his contribution to the MKUltra project was actually not about mind control and brainwashing, but about designing &quot;a scientifically based system for extracting information from &#039;resistant sources.&#039; In other words, torture.&quot;[59] Alfred W.

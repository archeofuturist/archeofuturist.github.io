(AP) \u2014 A federal appeals court says a gay couple&#039;s lawsuit seeking damages from a Kentucky county clerk who refused to issue them a marriage license can proceed. The ruling revives an issue that pulled the state into the center of a national debate over same-sex marriages following a historic Supreme Court ruling.<br><br>David Ermold and David Moore tried to get a marriage license in Rowan County, Kentucky, in June 2015 after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled same-sex marriage bans were unconstitutional. But Kim Davis, the county clerk, refused to issue them a license because she said it violated her religious beliefs.<br><br>Ermold and Moore want Davis to pay damages for the emotional distress caused by her refusal to issue them a license. Ermold and Moore were not the first couple to be denied a license. But they filmed their rejection and uploaded it to YouTube, which has been viewed more than 1.8 million times.<br><br>Liberty Counsel, a Florida-based law firm specializing in religious-liberty issues, has represented Davis throughout the case. The firm also represents former Alabama Supreme Court Chief Justice Roy Moore, who ordered state probate judges to continue to enforce that state&#039;s ban on same-sex marriage despite the U.S. Supreme Court ruling. Moore was removed from his post because of his order.

On Tuesday, Lambda Legal joined the suit, which seeks damages for breach of contract, negligent misrepresentation, and the intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress. Zawadski and Gaspari aren\u2019t suing the funeral home for engaging in anti-gay discrimination because Mississippi does not protect LGBTQ people from refusal of service. Indeed, the state\u2019s notorious HB 1523 actually protects businesses\u2019 right to turn away LGBTQ customers\u2014though the courts have put that law on hold for now.<br><br>Initially, the nearby Picayune Funeral Home seemed like a perfect choice, and Gaspari paid the company $1,795 to transport and cremate Huskey\u2019s body once he passed. But when Huskey died and the nursing home contacted the funeral home to pick up his body, it refused to do so. The funeral home had discovered that Huskey\u2019s next-of-kin was his husband, and realizing Huskey was gay, informed the nursing home that it did not \u201cdeal with their kind.\u201d","filename":"cremation","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":376,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":188,"tim":1493760853570,"time":1493760853,"md5":"yN+Uc1bUKqf7mc3aGKXhdA==","fsize":30474,"resto":0,"id":"aZuHgUXG","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"we-dont-deal-with-your-kind-ms-funeral-parlor","country_name":"United States","replies":9,"images":1,"omitted_posts":4,"omitted_images":1},{"no":123824843,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)17:49:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;drawing lines after death<\/span>","time":1493761744,"resto":123822817,"id":"4NHm6ef\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123824846,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)17:49:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt; a gay guy called Huskey<\/span><br><br>Just perfect","time":1493761745,"resto":123822817,"id":"5uLC0FdJ","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":123825300,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)17:52:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123822817\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123822817<\/a><br><br>If it&#039;s true.

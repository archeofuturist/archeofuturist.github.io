If you\u2019re not experiencing any pride in your life then you need to get up and make some changes to evoke a sense of pride within yourself. Pride in your appearance, bank account, career, living conditions, relationships and any other measuring stick you base your self-worth on are what make up a sense of strength. You cunts go round and round in circles discussing what is right for the world because you want to feel pride for your people, pride for your faith, pride for your country, pride for your family and pride for yourself. Pride for the world. It all starts with you, if you truly want to be a champion of the values you preach then exercise what they mean and become an example. What you all call \u2018power level\u2019 isn\u2019t how much you know, it is nothing more than what level of conviction in what you know is right. It is worth saying that you can\u2019t have conviction without knowledge or wisdom but if being a force of change interests you then pride is key. This board is begging to possess pride in what they know to be true, it\u2019s what connects every movement that \/pol\/ adores or latches on to whether it be the Third Reich, Trump, Ron Paul, the Crusades or whatever. Every vision of the world leaves man in the glory of pride, will it be for God, your people and the decency of man or will it be for an elevation of degeneracy as pic related displays in the barstardisation of the word \u2018pride\u2019. Pride for what is perceived as right will only fuel the hatred for what is therefore deemed wrong, it\u2019s the only avenue to change.","filename":"images-1","ext":".png","w":548,"h":268,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":122,"tim":1493736056200,"time":1493736056,"md5":"4ocLeIMLb9l\/jTh0OgudHw==","fsize":11949,"resto":0,"id":"Q+QFSMym","country":"AU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"pride-is-the-solution-of-all-of-lifes-problems-if","country_name":"Australia","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":123773318,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)10:37:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"Well the pendulum is swingin&#039; left again, it was fun while it lasted, godspeed lads, see you on the other side.","filename":"nazifroggun","ext":".png","w":579,"h":373,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":161,"tim":1493735861998,"time":1493735861,"md5":"jtx28aO5gTTOJeSBzap2Fg==","fsize":83672,"resto":0,"id":"zw0hW9RC","country":"IS","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"well-the-pendulum-is-swingin-left-again-it-was","country_name":"Iceland","replies":1,"images":0},{"no":123773670,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)10:40:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123773318\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123773318<\/a><br>think again wingnut. its the middles time to shine!!<br><br><br>WE MODERATE CENTRIST NOW!!!","time":1493736047,"resto":123773318,"id":"HVWbRkC1","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":123758814,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)07:42:58","name":"BATMAN","sub":"Fuck the EU","com":"The EU killed nyaa.se.

This combination is always bad because whites and East Asians are already advanced races, and mixing can only dilute their respective unique qualities while producing no new qualities. But a white man can impregnate a hapa, since the hapa is already mixed. <br><br>And finally, it is always wrong for females of higher race to mix with males of any other race. Females are the limiting factor in reproduction, so they are very reproductively valuable. The female is best seen as a limited natural resource of the nation, like coal or peat moss.

A new big brother if you will. <br>The left could potentially receive arms from our government or other foreign entities. <br>The Righteous Right<br><br>Cons<br>Most of our rural brothers are spread out. Organization on a short notice could prove to be costly.<br><br>Pros<br>Over ninety million rust belters are armed with more than one firearm in their homes.<br>The right has a plethora of armed militias across the country that are trained and ready to fight for old America. Some of these militias are huge private communities armed to the teeth.<br>Most of the right have veterans of war on their side, ready to relinquish their knowledge and combat skills if ever needed.<br>Most of the right live in rural areas, which could prove to be devastating if the Left decided to attack first. Gorilla warfare is no joke. <br>Most of the right are also in the military as of right now. Whether they&#039;d choose sides isn&#039;t clear, but there&#039;s always that possibility. <br>With the most obvious pros and cons in place, it&#039;s quite obvious who might come out on top. <br>But the left has an edge, and that could very well be government intervention or foreign aid.

Bigger weapons isn&#039;t the solution to that problem. No matter what you hit them with, if they can launch their entire nuclear stockpile at you immediately in retaliation, you&#039;re fucked. We need to be spending military research budgets on things like Direct Energy Weapons (ray guns dude) and better armor (robocop type shit) so that the direction of warfare technology becomes more focused and less deadly. If you can&#039;t look at the history of warfare and come to accept this fact, you are choosing suicide.","time":1493296902,"resto":122972349,"id":"qHUbu+fB","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123032044,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)08:42:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122992799\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122992799<\/a><br>MAD is already gonna happen due to what we have and will continue to produce","filename":"1465105502009","ext":".jpg","w":352,"h":389,"tn_w":113,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493296945155,"time":1493296945,"md5":"6+6EyvPOfa2eZM4wNoJANg==","fsize":30401,"resto":122972349,"id":"BtbAH8qA","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123032205,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)08:43:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122993378\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122993378<\/a><br>So liberals have found the final solution to the nigger problem?","time":1493297034,"resto":122972349,"id":"QDToizEX","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123032278,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)08:44:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123032205\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123032205<\/a><br>let it fuck your wife, it loses.","time":1493297079,"resto":122972349,"id":"BtbAH8qA","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":123031144,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)08:32:26","name":"Anonymous","sub":"BASED POLITICIANS","com":"ITT post your countries most based politician<br><br>for Croatia it&#039;s definitely Bozo Petrov<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;creates new party from nothing<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;becomes viable 3rd option party<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;exposes left and right for the corrupt useles globalist fucks they are<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;takes down government and causes preliminary election for second time<\/span>","filename":"petrov","ext":".jpg","w":1028,"h":536,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":130,"tim":1493296346198,"time":1493296346,"md5":"jRFQzAw0nEBGD6ZLCk7MeA==","fsize":246140,"resto":0,"id":"lsnOiaOZ","country":"HR","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"based-politicians","country_name":"Croatia","replies":2,"images":2},{"no":123031645,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)08:38:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"united a country against himself","filename":"abbott","ext":".png","w":280,"h":180,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":80,"tim":1493296685004,"time":1493296685,"md5":"KmowSIq2Ud4LlEAf8eL7kQ==","fsize":70034,"resto":123031144,"id":"cJeU1Ev7","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":123031830,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)08:40:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"I didn&#039;t know John Cena was croatian.

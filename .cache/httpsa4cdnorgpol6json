The US government is, just like in Iraq, Iran, and Syria, simply following the orders given to it by the Jewish lobby to destroy all enemies of Israel\u2014even if those orders are directly contradictory to the interests of America and will result in the death and maiming of even more Americans.","filename":"NorthKoreaFreeFromJewsMeme","ext":".jpg","w":732,"h":560,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":191,"tim":1492243302564,"time":1492243302,"md5":"EOvDK2WjUHEFXQt0GKemQw==","fsize":449084,"resto":0,"id":"l9SmoBvg","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-jews-want-north-korea-destroyed","country_name":"United States","replies":21,"images":1,"omitted_posts":16,"omitted_images":1},{"no":121188216,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)04:21:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121186999\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121186999<\/a><br>North korea only exists because of the jews.<br>Who do you think kicked out mcArthur?","time":1492244480,"resto":121186999,"id":"ms2Q8Cz4","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121188289,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)04:22:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121188128\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121188128<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Putin <\/span><br><br>haha keep on dreaming","time":1492244574,"resto":121186999,"id":"N1wfJy4a","country":"SI","country_name":"Slovenia"},{"no":121188495,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)04:26:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121187675\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121187675<\/a><br>&quot;Think that jews want to risk seoul being leveled, sending the global markets into crisis, just so they can tax a bunch of poor fucking norks who cannot even afford electricity.&quot; <br><br>Yet, you still want to bomb them to shit.","time":1492244797,"resto":121186999,"id":"feeuBI36","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121188818,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)04:32:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"Youre more scared of fucking missiles we can easily defend ourselves against that the global economy collapsing.

Compare the leadership of MacArthur, who became the de-facto emperor of Japan after defeating them in 4 years. Remember the IQ of the Japanese is above 100, they are not on average retarded like the Afghani&#039;s and Iraqi&#039;s. Now our Generals don&#039;t conquer the lands they invade. Instead they pussyfoot around for 15 years and here we are now in a worse position than when we started. This is because the Generals are pussies who are afraid to do what is necessary to ensure peace. If you&#039;ve ever read anything about MacArthur you know he had a plan from the beginning of the war to become the de-facto emperor and he knew if he didn&#039;t become emperor all would be in vain. Most people thought this was just his vanity, but it was actually what made him a genius.<br><br>The problem is that the Generals have become submissive. Go read any of the communications between Generals and Presidents before they got rid of MacArthur. Everyone knows MacArthur never once followed his orders, he only ever followed the war objectives. Truman got rid of him for insubordination. Look at the communications between Jefferson Davis and his generals, never were the Generals and President&#039;s in agreement. The only General that President Davis didn&#039;t chastise 100% of the time was Stonewall Jackson and that was because Jackson basically never lost, no matter the odds. The Generals are supposed to be in disagreement with the President for the simple fact that they know better. Do you think that Mattis disagrees with Trump to the extent that he is willing to call him an idiot to his face? I doubt it. But that&#039;s what Generals have done since the beginning of time. Generals have become pussiess, MacArthur was the last great American general and until we get more men like him who will directly defy the President and then be willing to CONQUER the lands they invade the military should not be praised.","time":1493458120,"resto":123305852,"id":"JE7ymVZw","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123318949,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)06:05:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123306723\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123306723<\/a><br>This.

I&#039;m going to use Herder and Joseph Cambells Hero with a thousand Faces for my bachelor this spring.","time":1493459370,"resto":123315761,"id":"woZ07gFQ","country":"DK","country_name":"Denmark"},{"no":123318212,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)05:53:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123317922\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123317922<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;smart you&#039;re choosing not to read Time and Being<\/span><br>T-that&#039;s what I&#039;m reading","filename":"sweating in hd","ext":".png","w":2271,"h":2380,"tn_w":119,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493459622613,"time":1493459622,"md5":"13eI97xKCo9dLBt3O4XmBA==","fsize":304867,"resto":123315761,"id":"ad+1l04K","country":"IT","country_name":"Italy"},{"no":123318244,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)05:54:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123315761\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123315761<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;thinging things thing<\/span><br>d r o p p e d. faggot can fuck off with that retarded shit.","time":1493459659,"resto":123315761,"id":"A8Tyzm3u","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":123318306,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)05:55:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123315761\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123315761<\/a><br>Bump.

It was commissioned as part of an advertising campaign developed by McCann, a global advertising corporation. And it was commissioned to be presented on the first anniversary of State Street Global\u2019s \u201cGender Diversity Index\u201d fund, which has the following NASDAQ ticker symbol: SHE. And finally, along with Fearless Girl is a bronze plaque that reads:<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Know the power of women in leadership. SHE makes a difference.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Note it\u2019s not She makes a difference, it\u2019s SHE makes a difference. It\u2019s not referring to the girl; it\u2019s referring to the NASDAQ symbol. It\u2019s not a work of guerrilla art; it\u2019s an extremely clever advertising scheme. This is what makes it clever: Fearless Girl derives its power almost entirely from Di Modica\u2019s statue.<\/span>","filename":"fearless-girl-and-bull","ext":".jpg","w":768,"h":386,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492622712976,"time":1492622712,"md5":"RtJQzciOASVA6BlLyfCcjQ==","fsize":81772,"resto":0,"id":"HCToQ+Hy","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"fearless-girl-statue","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0}]}]}

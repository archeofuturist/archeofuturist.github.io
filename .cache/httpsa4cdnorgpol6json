This general is for the discussion of Marxism-Leninism, the ideology of revolutionary socialism and communism.<br><br>Communism is the next stage of humanity following the capitalist stage.<br><br>What exactly is communism according to Marxist-Leninists:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Communism is a stage of society in which the productive infrastructure is socially owned, and goods are produced not in order to sell for profit, but in order to meet a social need.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Communism in it&#039;s full form is a stateless, classless society that follows the maxim &quot;From each according to their ability, to each according to their need.&quot;<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;To achieve such a society Marxism-Leninism teaches us that we must replace the capitalist state, which is controlled by the capitalist class, by a socialist state, which is controlled by the working class. Then, a period of class struggle follows in which the capitalist class is liquidated by the working class. When the capitalist class has been completely vanquished, there will be only one class, the working class, and eventually the functions of the state will become indistinguishable from the functions of the society as a whole, and the state as such will &#039;wither away&#039; as Marx said.<\/span><br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/ma<wbr>rx\/works\/1847\/11\/prin-com.htm<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/ma<wbr>rx\/works\/1848\/communist-manifesto\/<br><br>ML uses a philosophy called dialectical materialism, see here:<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/reference\/<wbr>archive\/stalin\/works\/1938\/09.htm<br><br>It is recommended that you read some of the critical works of Marxism-Leninism so you can make an informed assessment of the ideology.<br><br>Resources:<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/ma<wbr>rx\/works\/sw\/<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/le<wbr>nin\/works\/sw\/<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/reference\/<wbr>archive\/stalin\/works\/decades-index.<wbr>htm<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/reference\/<wbr>archive\/mao\/selected-works\/<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/ma<wbr>rx\/works\/1884\/origin-family\/<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/le<wbr>nin\/works\/1914\/mar\/11.htm","filename":"1481244074852","ext":".png","w":1010,"h":1010,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490255544726,"time":1490255544,"md5":"676S1nirnOI5InkeibSxFw==","fsize":177742,"resto":0,"id":"wBABLAz4","country":"ES","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"communism-general","country_name":"Spain","replies":208,"images":80,"omitted_posts":203,"omitted_images":77,"tail_size":50},{"no":117932104,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)09:46:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117905337\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117905337<\/a><br><br>OP is a massive faggot<br>His dick is tinier than a newborn maggot<br>He really thought he was being funny clever and witty <br>But in actuality his post was just very shitty <br><br>The only other thing his mouth spills out that dumb <br>Are impossibility large quantities of nigger cum <br>He wishes he had a woman between his knees <br>but instead he can only jack off to dick-girl fantasies <br><br>the only action he&#039;ll ever get is a one-way with his hand <br>infact his entire birth wasn&#039;t even planned <br>His room is full of dragon-dildos and weeaboo-merch <br>he is even more pathetic than Anthony Birch <br><br>the last time he saw a real vagina was when he was born<br>the last time moon-man inside job his mom her cervix was torn.<br>O look OP&#039;s mom is already knocking on my door <br>and her gaping cunt is begging for more <br><br>so before i go i want you all to have a nice day <br>and remind everyone in this thread that op is fucking gay<br>&#039;kkkay &#039;kkkay &#039;kkkay?<br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Een<wbr>IXVoALmU","filename":"moonman","ext":".jpg","w":480,"h":360,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1490276797731,"time":1490276797,"md5":"9hzH3ho7KrK8nnhS2yHDZA==","fsize":7528,"resto":117905337,"id":"r8rd+GSc","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":117932410,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)09:49:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117929395\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117929395<\/a><br><a href=\"#p117929346\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117929346<\/a><br><a href=\"#p117929295\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117929295<\/a><br><a href=\"#p117929272\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117929272<\/a><br><a href=\"#p117929245\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117929245<\/a><br>Hello gomrades!

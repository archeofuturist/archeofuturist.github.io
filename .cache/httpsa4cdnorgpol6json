Whatever your view on Bannon&#039;s demotion, the way Trump has allowed Kushner to project power in the White House is unprofessional and disconcerting. Trump is the master of optics, which is why he dismissed Flynn, because the *optics* in that case were that Flynn went above Pence&#039;s head in Russia talks. <br><br>Kushner is reveling in this persona over the last week, like he&#039;s Richie Rich. It&#039;s fine to have him go to Iraq if the Trump admin is transparent but it was a dogwhistle to everyone that Kushner is essentially the hipster gen&#039;s Kissinger now. And the nepotism is dangerous; the emotional component with the president&#039;s doted daughter can be exploited inside and by Intel agents outside. <br><br>Trump won due to transparency. He&#039;d be tweeting a storm if Chelsea&#039;s (((husband))) with a criminal dad (like Kushner) was soaring over Iraq and shadowing Hillary like a Corleone. <br><br>To make matters worse, Trump has allowed Bannon, his populist pugilist, to be ripped in the media today, and yet Trump offers zero info or encouragement for Bannon on social. <br><br>Remember when Flynn was on the line? Trump was similarly mum. Rumors heated that Flynn would resign and he did. This is now a mark on Bannon&#039;s legacy, as Michael Flynn&#039;s son even noted--see above. <br><br>Compound that with Trump&#039;s blatant flipflop on Syria and chem weapons, with no respect for his supporters who dislike this ME intervention. <br><br>It&#039;s totally unlike Trump. We&#039;re four months in, and he&#039;s testing his base while his daughter basks in unmerited inside baseball. It&#039;s gross. No other president would get away with this shit. <br><br>I say it&#039;s 70% Bannon resigns before Monday. It&#039;s all about face.

I&#039;ve read a lot of arguments saying any child born here is granted citizenship and just as many saying if their parents are not natural born citizens they are not granted citizenship. Personally, I think the later makes more sense. Just because your parents waddle over here 8 and half months before you&#039;re about to be born does not make you a citizen and I think the founders felt the same way. I feel like all Americans are being cucked with birthright citizenship of foreign parents.

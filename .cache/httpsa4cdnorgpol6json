I have written a book called The Foundation for Exploration in my spare time (I&#039;m a full-time neet) and I would really appreciate it if you could give it a read.<br><br>-It is pol&#039;s book. It has some very serious and groundbreaking ideas regarding the origins of a lot of emotions that a typical pol user may go through. Wrath, depression, madness, and hedonism all stem from powerlessness. In order to alleviate this powerlessness, you need courage, self-control, wonder, and humor. You also need collective organization because there are deeply entrenched society-wide problems that one man cannot defeat. That is why we need a full-scale revolution of our society. I believe my book can be a cornerstone of a revolution because it has a strong philosophical basis. Pol can be a strong cornerstone of this revolution.<br>-I dive into sexual dynamics in pol-fashion. Men need to cultivate masculinity and not be cucks, yet not be overly animalistic and women must cultivate femininity and not be roastie whores (shouldn&#039;t pursue hedonism and the animalistic nature of man) I go into this in great detail and explain that strong families are the provider of great happiness and power, and they come from a balancing of the two spectrums I call the Power and Animalistic-Artificial Spectrums. <br>-The focus of the brave new society I create is to inspire wonder back into people, with a bringing back to nature and in the end a focus on exploring the cosmos. The economics calls for cooperation between people, superseding the focus on profits and rigid structure.<br><br>WE MUST START A REVOLUTION.<br>This is not an advertisement, the book is free.

Over the last few months I have changed mentally though and now am wanting to stop and feeling guilty when i watch it. Its worst when i make it like a week without watching and then finally break and give in even though i wasnt even really horny to begin with and just searched for it for no reason other than boredom mostly. Porn will really fuck up your mind and get you fapping to fucked up shit which is probably part of the reason why i began to hate it and feel extremely shitty after watching.","time":1491283416,"resto":119423544,"id":"Nh\/rD9AT","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":119406660,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)20:46:43","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Why must niggers ruin everything??","com":"Look at this bullshit.<br><br>https:\/\/m.youtube.com\/watch?v=RlTb5<wbr>UhnbzQ<br><br>https:\/\/m.youtube.com\/watch?v=lxvUf<wbr>gAKZi8","filename":"1484723078976s","ext":".jpg","w":246,"h":138,"tn_w":246,"tn_h":138,"tim":1491266803506,"time":1491266803,"md5":"ULi1E1cQib6FrNfmRPPoTg==","fsize":3850,"resto":0,"id":"y6QPNL7U","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"why-must-niggers-ruin-everything","country_name":"United States","replies":102,"images":30,"omitted_posts":97,"omitted_images":29,"tail_size":50},{"no":119434656,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)01:14:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119406660\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119406660<\/a><br><br>because they&#039;re literal higher monkey species. monkeys do stupid things.","time":1491282863,"resto":119406660,"id":"NGCbm8AR","country":"TR","country_name":"Turkey"},{"no":119434813,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)01:16:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119406660\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119406660<\/a><br>not even hip hop music. just some cookie cutter shit music","time":1491282975,"resto":119406660,"id":"XzWvs1Sr","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119434931,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)01:17:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"WE WUZ SWAN LAKE MUDDAFUGGA","time":1491283074,"resto":119406660,"id":"Iq+L7odn","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":119435085,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)01:19:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119406660\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119406660<\/a><br>We have already talked about this.

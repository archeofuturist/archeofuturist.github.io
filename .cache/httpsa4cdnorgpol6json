Negative effects were small but concentrated in certain locations. 95% of economists per the NYT agreed that NAFTA had net positive impact for all involved. Most economists also agree that deindustrialization was compounded largely by advances in automative technology and other innovations (and thus many of those jobs were bound to go). <br><br>Many of the predicted problems actually never materialized, one such theorized problem stated that Canada&#039;s furniture industry would collapse by 2000&#039;s. The opposite occurred. <br><br>Democrats were largely against NAFTA and still are to a degree even today. Republicans backed NAFTA and pushed Clinton to adopt it. Full disclosure, I am a Democrat, but it seems the republicans and slick Willy were right.

The majority outlook on life these days, especially where I&#039;m from, is that going to college is necessary to have further success in life.

Kids enter college as freshmen with a reasonably normal outlook on life, and graduate having spent years being pumped with leftist slogans of white guilt, queer theory, women&#039;s studies (required courses in some majors these days), and other assorted subversive leftist garbage. I don&#039;t have concrete evidence, but I bet if you did a survey of the colored hair types at a given college, they probably skew more toward upperclassmen than freshman.

Previously, Western Civilization enforced monogamy through various legal, religious and social pressures. As these restrictions have been removed, we are regressing back to the jungle in which women have multiple sexual partners with a small subset of the male population. In primitive societies this results in the harem. In such an arrangement the top 20% of the males sexually monopolize 80% of the females. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; We have seen such behavior for years in the inner city in which women have multiple \u201cbaby daddies\u201d. If you should visit a city such as Detroit, you will have a hard time finding a woman who has multiple children from the same father. What is interesting about these arrangements is that the biological fathers tend to be a small subset of the male population within the city. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;We find that 80% of these women share the 20% of the men in an unofficial polygamous arrangement. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; The problem with such a polygamous arrangement is that 80% of the men are left out of the sexual marketplace. And such men tend to be violent and unlikely to be productive members of society. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;This is the situation that you can find in most primitive countries in Africa.<\/span><br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Oez<wbr>icH0pZmk<br><br>Western Society Has Become Sexually Like Africa","filename":"1462109470138","ext":".jpg","w":281,"h":351,"tn_w":200,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491313749229,"time":1491313749,"md5":"euNFuorilN8m1pDKW6eQew==","fsize":15778,"resto":0,"id":"xLcUrcVT","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"modern-liberated-woman-claims-to-have-fucked-over","country_name":"United States","replies":181,"images":39,"omitted_posts":176,"omitted_images":38,"tail_size":50},{"no":119506725,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)15:42:30","name":"Anonymous","filename":"received_1465535900184958-1","ext":".jpg","w":1131,"h":998,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":110,"tim":1491334950563,"time":1491334950,"md5":"AsAIFp9b+mBVYt6wd6jdUg==","fsize":447292,"resto":119470578,"id":"xnCAhVs3","country":"GB","m_img":1,"country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119507471,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)15:48:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119499939\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119499939<\/a><br><a href=\"#p119500154\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119500154<\/a><br><a href=\"#p119500499\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119500499<\/a><br><a href=\"#p119500720\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119500720<\/a><br><a href=\"#p119500807\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119500807<\/a><br><a href=\"#p119502036\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119502036<\/a><br><a href=\"#p119503782\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119503782<\/a><br><a href=\"#p119504858\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119504858<\/a><br><a href=\"#p119506453\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119506453<\/a><br><br>DEZE FUCKING ZIELIGE KANKERIJERS<br><br>I wish you non-Dutch fuckers could read this.","time":1491335327,"resto":119470578,"id":"Ksd8bBu0","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":119508125,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)15:54:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119506453\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119506453<\/a><br>Probeer dan geen persoonlijke informatie in je profiel te doen of hou je profiel priv\u00e9 voor iedereen.

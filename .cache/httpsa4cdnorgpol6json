Despite what role-players will say about Communism being a global conspiracy to destroy them, the political ideology actually works best with this Abrahamic religion. Jesus himself set about prioritizing the needs of the meek, the poor, the sick, and the hungry, above all else. He spoke of sharing with those that were worse off than you, and making all men equal under the eyes of God, with no king or emperor to come between them. Despite the USSR&#039;s atheist policies, and the crimes of the early Bolsheviks, Christian Communism is on the rise, and of all of the religions, it fits this political system the best.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Nazi Germany: Islam. Regardless of the fact that Hitler himself was likely a pagan black sun worshipper, and\/or an atheist, he spoke ill of Christianity multiple times in private, and spoke greatly of Islam&#039;s heroism and power. He was very intrigued by its ideology and law, and had preferred that it became the religion of Germany instead. Nazi Germany was very Islamic in spirit, as it believed that the very strongest will survive, that their method was above all others, and they should dominate those deemed beneath them, or opposing them. The Germans saw Adolf as the closest thing to God, and submitted entirely to him. Islam means submission, and is a religion of conquering, dominance, and zero tolerance for other ideologies, similar to Nazi Germany.<\/span><br>Now before you stormcucks attack me for this, think how it can work in your favor. Use this argument on AntiFa\/Leftists to make them see that Christianity is indeed the communist way to have everyone be ((equal)), and point out how similar NatSoc Germany and Islam are. I am afraid that it is too late to convince the world AH was right, so you might as well make the shame of Germany useful in your arguments. <br><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; inb4 jew<\/span>","filename":"220px-Sickle_and_Cross","ext":".png","w":220,"h":211,"tn_w":220,"tn_h":211,"tim":1493691916341,"time":1493691916,"md5":"HxVsmdzj8CadQl4\/0prAmQ==","fsize":9807,"resto":0,"id":"ZBFFNpki","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"which-religions-best-fit-civilizations-of-the","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":1},{"no":123712643,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)22:28:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123712279\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123712279<\/a><br>communism is a jewish religion for goys","filename":"juden","ext":".png","w":1102,"h":901,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":102,"tim":1493692080501,"time":1493692080,"md5":"MLUb12Ze\/TnWFtafvJd06w==","fsize":1628992,"resto":123712279,"id":"EGzyqyXD","country":"CA","m_img":1,"country_name":"Canada"}]},{"posts":[{"no":123702567,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)21:05:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"There is nothing inherently wrong with black people. <br><br>The degeneracy that we see at-large in black culture (think Detroit) is mainly caused by liberal politicians and globalists forcing them onto the government teat and destroying any chance at culture that they may otherwise have. <br><br>Blacks have a right to be proud of their ancestry, just like whites or any other race.

God exists but now what?","com":"After my edgy atheist phase during my teen days I got interested in learning all I can about religion. Im not baptized even though my parents believe in God, but they always thought that I should get baptized knowing what it implies and actually really believing in the faith. That&#039;s why this past half year in particular I&#039;ve dedicated myself to learn and study more about theology and all the scientific evidence that we have available that would lead us to believe that there is in fact a God, and I must say that despite what most of those edgy atheists (that I once was) say, there&#039;s a lot of evidence that can suggest this. After that I tried to learn the story of Jesus and after watching things like Jim Caviezel&#039;s testimony and The Pasion of Christ, and reading some books and articles from that matter, I&#039;ve never been so moved by the force and attraction that JC gives me. Almost like a heavenly force. This added to the fact that there is a clear agenda to demonize christianity gives even more reason to believe that this is the Truth. But after having christianity as a middle ground to study more about this I&#039;ve been getting confused lately about this inside fight between what I guess are anabaptists like Pastor Steven Anderson (from which I&#039;ve seen some of his sermons and movies like Marching to Zion) who claim that churches are not in the bible and that you get saved through faith alone and not through works, and those who believe that the church is the body of Christ and you should confess your sins to the priest and do good deeds. The confusing part is that both claims that the Bible backs all of their points, but for example Steven Anderson says that the only true version of the Bible is the King James version. If anyone can enlighten me I would greately appreciate it.<br><br>The idea is to discuss this in the most unbiased way possible.<br>Thanks","filename":"1b6142e668daeb4188bef76a849fdc45ace5870b9b9702700b945b5f19b2acc7","ext":".jpg","w":457,"h":546,"tn_w":209,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493691341138,"time":1493691341,"md5":"maRWk0s0mRo3HfdHZ+B99g==","fsize":52402,"resto":0,"id":"KQH1uHsR","country":"AR","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"so-i-finally-came-up-to-my-senses-god-exists-but","country_name":"Argentina","replies":3,"images":0},{"no":123711408,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)22:18:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123711076\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123711076<\/a><br><br>go away nigger","time":1493691491,"resto":123711076,"id":"tKlgXYAK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123711782,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)22:21:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123711076\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123711076<\/a><br>While I believe in a creator God, and the reality of natural\/universal law, I found it very difficult to align myself with any one doctrine or dogma.

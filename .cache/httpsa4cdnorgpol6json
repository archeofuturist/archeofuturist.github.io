Jaf Shah, the executive director of the support group Acid Survivors Trust International (ASTI), told the Guardian: &quot;Looking at the data in general, there is a fairly large probability that a high percentage of the incidents are male-on-male attacks and most likely to be gang-related.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;The numbers appear to be very high and suggest an increase, which is very concerning.&quot; A former gang member described how acid attacks had become more acceptable and were not seen as a &quot;big deal&quot;. &quot;People don&#039;t think of the consequences,&quot; he said. &quot;It&#039;s easy to buy most of the ingredients legally\u2026One of my cousins was done a few years ago.

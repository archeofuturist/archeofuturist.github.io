They were mostly Jew merchants in the coastal cities, so no communism there. During the mandate more moved in, but the migration didn&#039;t really start until 1945. One big problem was that none of the kikes knew how to farm so they all piled into the coastal cities and tried to become merchants. Kibbutzim were formed because the cities were full of kike merchants and they had to get the newly arrived helpless fucks out of the cities and take control of the countryside from the goatfucking Arab savages. The kibbutzim were never self-sustaining and in the 1970s, after the initial need for them was over, the Israeli government stopped subsidizing them and they all succumbed to bankruptcy. They are pretty much just regular towns now.","time":1491885431,"resto":120545648,"id":"F1PbN15X","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120554403,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)00:44:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"Never met someone who openly supports socialism\/communism, but for those of you who have, have you ever asked them what they think their role would be in this type of society?","time":1491885859,"resto":120545648,"id":"+G2\/4H7L","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120556235,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)01:00:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120545648\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120545648<\/a><br><br>socialism can work if its only one high iq tribe involved","time":1491886832,"resto":120545648,"id":"r8hz2H+z","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120557962,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)01:17:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"Did you forget the golden rule of debating?

Is college overrated or am I missing something? People act like college is the best time of your life, but I&#039;m miserable as fucking shit. I want to be an free independent adult already with a good paying job and a wife that isn&#039;t a slut (and is intelligent) and maybe a kid and not have my fucking parents down my throat treating me like their baby boy. <br><br>Is it just me or does college fucking suck? I&#039;m surrounded by privileged liberal retards who are basically just spoiled high schoolers except worse because they live on their own and think they&#039;re smart bc they&#039;re in college now. It&#039;s like this shitty stage of your life where you&#039;re not a kid with no responsibilities like in high school, but you also have no money and everything is overwhelming as fuck trying to start your life.<br><br>Everyone wants to fucking &quot;party&quot; and be a normie all the time. All the girls here are normie fucking drug addicted whores and borderline alcoholic hedonists.<br><br>Is it just me or is the education\/job system completely fucked up? Like why the fuck does college even exist? People should be ready for jobs at like 18-20 and not have fucking extended childhoods, it&#039;s making me wanna puke. I hate college, I hate the real world.","filename":"6c9743f62f13262f375a35d91c19ce29","ext":".jpg","w":359,"h":512,"tn_w":175,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491888632201,"time":1491888632,"md5":"kFCzxiIq1bL3Qx9Wyz0+ow==","fsize":75384,"resto":0,"id":"Q639WoZR","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"is-college-overrated-as-fuck-or-what","country_name":"United States","replies":13,"images":0,"omitted_posts":8,"omitted_images":0},{"no":120560973,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)01:47:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120560813\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120560813<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;It&#039;s fine if you can afford it.

If the adults dont believe what they believe then its obviously because they are retarded because its just impossible for them to be wrong. Anybody who disagrees with them is not only wrong but evil and must be silenced and destroyed. The past two generations have been literally raised by television and now the Internet that my generation used as babysitters, they get their morals and world view from the last 30 seconds of a south park episode where the kid speaks and basically lectures the adults with a reasonable argument that ends up saving the day and the adults were barely capable of understanding.

Better yet, stop watching (((television))). Because Colbert, Noah, Oliver and all those late-night comedians are all left-wing puppets and there is nothing you can do to change them or their networks. If Colbert got fired, he&#039;d get replaced with another leftie which isn&#039;t any better.

Getting your tits in a twist only got that played further. In tonight&#039;s monologue Stephen walked it back an inch and literally no one gave a fuck. Gays are posting in the comments saying Colbert is fine saying as much, because it&#039;s more a thing about how Trump is Putin&#039;s bitch and less a homosexual sex thing. Besides, Trump&#039;s mouth looks like a dog&#039;s arsehole, so that&#039;s more of a slight against Putin than anyone.<br><br>Oh and then he reported on Comey&#039;s testimony which is a fuck-ton more newsworthy and because of it literally no one gives a shit about this at all.

So fungus or frogs that seem male but lay viable eggs are examples. Intersex has all sorts of presentations and over 50 known types and known causes, some of which having little to no detectable traits, externally or even via a simple blood test. You often have to look at the sex chromosomes to figure it out. I have two friends who have Kleinfelders a type of intersex and one transitioned to become a woman and the other stayed a dude. I can&#039;t really say which one is happier, but my overall point is that intersex being being lumped into LGBT has only been happening the past 10 years or so.

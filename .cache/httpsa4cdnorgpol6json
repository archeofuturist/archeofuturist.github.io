It doesn&#039;t offer room for intellectualism or fact-based refutation. It operates entirely on clickbait, imagery and quick replies, especially on the faster boards like \/pol\/. On other websites such as NYT, reddit or more traditional forums, you are able to view and respond to a post hours after it has been made. This type of structure offers a much more intellectual-based dialog in which points can be refuted with facts and highlighted to be seen by many. In short, this disparity creates a very clear divide in political opinions and views - one based on facts and intellectual standards, and one based on imagery and propaganda.<br><br>What does \/pol\/ think?","filename":"science-quote-1-1","ext":".jpg","w":563,"h":705,"tn_w":199,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493944792645,"time":1493944792,"md5":"PCkiNkSJR8iU5Rh9aD+dyA==","fsize":242874,"resto":0,"id":"mprQ+2AO","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-biggest-issue-i-see-with-pol-and-websites","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0},{"no":124138693,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)20:41:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"Well no shit a board with 124m posts will not have a very good post quality.","time":1493944892,"resto":124138470,"id":"D+7CnJlk","country":"AR","country_name":"Argentina"}]},{"posts":[{"no":124094741,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)15:03:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"How is poland going since Andrzej Duda was elected ?<br><br>Leftist in France start using Poland as an exemple to why we should vote for macron, especially on Facebook.<br><br>Can i have some point of view from real \/pol\/ish that i can use against them ?","filename":"800px-Herb_Polski.svg","ext":".png","w":800,"h":941,"tn_w":212,"tn_h":249,"tim":1493924599768,"time":1493924599,"md5":"Hib3OEr+tJ5l2\/L\/J7DkEA==","fsize":277235,"resto":0,"id":"+rNhUYiR","country":"FR","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"how-is-poland-going-since-andrzej-duda-was","country_name":"France","replies":245,"images":42,"omitted_posts":240,"omitted_images":42,"tail_size":50},{"no":124136719,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)20:25:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124136370\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124136370<\/a><br>Just do as the sandniggers did, just stroll in and take everything.","time":1493943930,"resto":124094741,"id":"\/U4fwbjy","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124136820,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)20:26:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124136389\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124136389<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;populist<\/span><br>wykop pe el, aha, sprawd\u017a to","time":1493943983,"resto":124094741,"id":"G9ZYqEkz","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":124136943,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)20:27:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124136820\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124136820<\/a><br>O co Ci chodzi?","time":1493944036,"resto":124094741,"id":"gKZhJp3o","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":124138451,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)20:39:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"How the fuk does poland say no to refugees and not give a fuck and still have full benafits from being an e.u member?","time":1493944781,"resto":124094741,"id":"YUMueaP8","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124138677,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)20:41:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124138451\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124138451<\/a><br>We refuse them swiftly, usually after terrorists attacks.

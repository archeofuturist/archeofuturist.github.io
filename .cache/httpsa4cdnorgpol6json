Perhaps the amplitude of this support is due to a context of bullying and pogroms, but it has never been so complete in any other country (and perhaps never in all the past centuries). Our intelligentsia was so generous, so freedom\u2010loving, that it ostracised anti\u2010Semitism from society and humanity; moreover, the one who did not give his frank and massive support to the struggle for equal rights of the Jews, who did not make it a priority, was considered a \u201cdespicable anti\u2010Semite\u201d. With its ever\u2010awakening moral consciousness and extreme sensitivity, the Russian intelligentsia sought to understand and assimilate the Jewish view of priorities affecting the whole of political life: is deemed progressive all that is a reaction against the persecution of the Jews, all the rest is reactionary. Not only did Russian society firmly defend the Jews against the government, but it forbade itself and forbade anyone to show any trace of a shadow of criticism of the conduct of each Jew in particular: and if this bore anti\u2010Semitism within me? (The generation formed at that time retained these principles for decades.)<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;As for the Jewish intelligentsia, it did not deny its national identity. Even the most extreme of Jewish socialists struggled to reconcile their ideology with national sentiment. At the same time, there was no voice among the Jews\u2014from Dubnov to Jabotinsky, passing by Winaver\u2014to say that the Russian intelligentsia, who supported their persecuted brothers with all their souls, might not give up his own national feeling. Equity would have required it. But no one perceived this disparity: under the notion of equality of rights, the Jews understood something more.<\/span><br><br>Here is Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn on Jews in Russia.<br><br>https:\/\/twohundredyearstogether.wor<wbr>dpress.com","time":1493876004,"resto":124015802,"id":"vKQkygAX","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124025232,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)01:35:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124015802\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124015802<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;here&#039;s at least one solid reason for you.<\/span><br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Cmh<wbr>NFfZNxEI<br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=E9O<wbr>W1pmy5gQ&amp;t=15s","time":1493876121,"resto":124015802,"id":"CS\/j0NBB","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":124025260,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)01:35:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124016183\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124016183<\/a><br><br>This.

The foreigners don&#039;t actually enjoy life in Germany, they would prefer living in their own cultures. They just stay for the gibs.<br>But they opposed this so violently to separate themselves from the right that it will be almost impossible for them to go back on it. They might win back some of the voters on the right who are stupid enough to believe them again, but they&#039;d lose many more voters from the left who have been indoctrinated to see this kind of behavior as Hitler&#039;s rebirth by them.","time":1493030312,"resto":122569981,"id":"mC5v347+","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":122572178,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)06:38:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122569981\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122569981<\/a><br><br>This is what happens you are too soft on the jews.","time":1493030338,"resto":122569981,"id":"XTfsbK85","country":"MX","country_name":"Mexico"},{"no":122572345,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)06:41:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122572178\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122572178<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;This is what happens you are too soft on the jews.<\/span><br><br>THIS THIS THIS<br><br>Anyone who doesn&#039;t advocate killing jews and nuking Israel is a puppet of the kikes","time":1493030509,"resto":122569981,"id":"GxC8T76D","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122572443,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)06:43:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122570392\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122570392<\/a><br>when you realize its a scheme by the Jews to give up all money to the collective i mean get over yourself first community food night and the filthy jews will be eating more than everyone else to remember the 6 million gorilian","time":1493030596,"resto":122569981,"id":"8TqGWsVQ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122573023,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)06:51:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122570403\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122570403<\/a><br>This is true. I was really black pilled yesterday. (although it went exactly as I thought it would), but upon reflect realized that when I first started getting into dissident politics in 2013, there was literally 0 chance of things getting this far. A nationalist (even if flip-floppy) winning the US election? Britain leaving the EU? Le Pen in round 2 of the French Elections? It was all impossible. Now it&#039;s not. Rome wasn&#039;t built in a day. Austria, France and the Netherlands all showed incredible gains from a few years ago. It may just require more time (and more migration) for people to realize the truth.","time":1493031095,"resto":122569981,"id":"sGDGg7N6","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]},{"posts":[{"no":122559883,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)03:44:47","name":"Anonymous","sub":"*Sips beer*","com":"Well?","filename":"CAD09868-7DD4-41B0-861F-E9CE596BB0DE-8058-000005999B7760FF","ext":".jpg","w":900,"h":900,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493019887585,"time":1493019887,"md5":"5hHS5D2TfKkP+WL5hOemyg==","fsize":287181,"resto":0,"id":"9i8mfFmf","country":"AU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"sips-beer","country_name":"Australia","replies":269,"images":39,"omitted_posts":264,"omitted_images":38,"tail_size":50},{"no":122572048,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)06:37:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122566220\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122566220<\/a><br>fuck","filename":"1493027393010","ext":".png","w":607,"h":508,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":104,"tim":1493030245505,"time":1493030245,"md5":"QSNYGlJ\/2S7KmXAJ+YmJ1w==","fsize":24650,"resto":122559883,"id":"hCUCVS7B","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":122572229,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)06:39:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122559883\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122559883<\/a><br>Well, well, well, would ya look at that.","filename":"1485356547499","ext":".png","w":185,"h":233,"tn_w":99,"tn_h":124,"tim":1493030389695,"time":1493030389,"md5":"g8ObXbcCJyClWi+zXnhS3g==","fsize":38891,"resto":122559883,"id":"hnfmC\/5k","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":122572284,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)06:40:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122560165\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122560165<\/a><br>It&#039;s funny because even in this little island I get better internet","time":1493030442,"resto":122559883,"id":"inxut10o","country":"NZ","country_name":"New Zealand"},{"no":122572817,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)06:48:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122559883\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122559883<\/a><br>appreciate your patriotism but Oz is a shit-hole run by some of the biggest morons on the planet.

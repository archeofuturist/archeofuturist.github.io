In news articles, mostly all that&#039;s discussed are individual issue positions, and never the philosophy behind them, which I think is the most attractive part of the alt-right. <br><br>One axiom I&#039;ve thought of is &quot;You don&#039;t have the right to be weak.&quot;. In my mind this perfectly encapsulates what the left is doing wrong. They are fighting for the right to be weak. It also works in multiple contexts. Self-control, personal responsibility, freedom of speech (anti-safe spaces), etc. <br><br>What else should we be pushing more as our philosophical roots? What are your axioms of belief? Remember, if its just something like &quot;fuck Jews&quot; it&#039;ll immediately get lambasted. We&#039;re looking for things that hold up to intense scrutiny and cut through the bullshit noise and grab the attention of the common man as undeniable truths.","filename":"1487887560370","ext":".jpg","w":539,"h":521,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":241,"tim":1490532330231,"time":1490532330,"md5":"fcvWXjVqsSKFn2WtwgLN4Q==","fsize":73340,"resto":0,"id":"qlaxud1P","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"pol-philosophy","country_name":"United States","replies":10,"images":0,"omitted_posts":5,"omitted_images":0},{"no":118359199,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)09:01:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118358665\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118358665<\/a><br><br>Thats not a new idea, it has high costs for almost no benefits, and there is nothing inherently wrong with or &quot;weak&quot; about doing drugs","time":1490533288,"resto":118358068,"id":"YoY99mfI","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118359223,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)09:01:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118358559\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118358559<\/a><br>I agree, personal property is an excellent axiom, and it has the benefit of being undeniable to everyone who isn&#039;t just a blatant communist.<br>I&#039;d defend my point by saying that the expanded version of my thought would be &quot;You don&#039;t have the right to be weak without being exposed to the consequences that come with it&quot;, which is probably an important nuance.","time":1490533306,"resto":118358068,"id":"qlaxud1P","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118359494,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)09:05:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118358986\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118358986<\/a><br>Gamergate was internet drama that had zero effect on the world one way or another.

A right is a concept of ownership of something that you cannot be denied under law, not under nature. You have a right to free speech, but in reality communist governments like Obama&#039;s USA or Erdogan in Turkey do not honor those rights and throw journalists in jail. A right from nature is the ownership of your body. Other people stealing your organs is wrong on a level anyone agrees on, except of course organ thieves.<br><br>Usually when I debate leftists, I ask simple questions like &quot;Do you believe in personal property&quot; and &quot;Is stealing morally wrong&quot;, followed by &quot;If you have a need, do you get to steal&quot; which then of course leads to criminal tax systems which rob people through the power of the government.<br><br>While I agree with the sentiment of what you&#039;re saying, it needlessly obfuscates the moral questions you&#039;re posing.

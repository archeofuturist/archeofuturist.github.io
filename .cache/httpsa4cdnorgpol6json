Harassed for being white from my earliest time at school through to it&#039;s completion. Harassed as a tall white adult constantly, constant aggression from mexicants and accusations of racism. People are incredibly hostile here.<br><br>Moving several times as a consequence of the neighborhoods being overrun with families packed like sardines in houses and the criminality that comes with it. Constant parties with blaring polka music until 2AM with zero regard for people.<br><br>Go up north and you will discover that there are multiple California&#039;s yet still full of hostile assholes. Take a road trip to Santa Cruz and walk downtown where ever 10 feet is some dreg of society sitting on their ass begging for money. Go check out the farmers market and see some ham planet actually start screaming about the patriarchy and chanting shit in the middle of it like it&#039;s a forum for her mental illness.<br><br>Try to escape and go see some natural beauty and it all follows you there along with a mass of Chinese tourist that act like locust.","time":1492978339,"resto":122459944,"id":"c7L3a88T","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}]}

Were Alexander the Great or Cecil Rhodes misogynistic, racist, patriarchal bigots or are those just labels used by weak-minded and weak-willed individuals? Back in those days (before jews invented the whole concept of social justice) the West still had its balls intact and were the masters of their own destinies. To achieve greatness it was believed sacrifices would have to be made. <br><br>Russia had fallen to Bolshevism where millions were already dying of starvation, and the jews wanted to bring the same sickness to Germany. It was acknowledged that Germany would have to strike first if they were to preserve Germany&#039;s culture, traditions, and racial homogeneity. At that critical juncture it was a choice between keeping Germany &#039;German&#039; or letting the jews enslave the German population, as they&#039;d already done to Russia and China (and are currently in the final stages of doing to Europe and the United States). <br><br>It&#039;s commonly assumed that if Germany had won the world would have been a dark and oppressive place ruled by tyrants. On the contrary, the world would be much more civilised. Germany would have built a new global empire and the German people (a proud and noble race) would have been its curators. No more sickness, no more degeneracy, no more racial mixing, and much less conflict caused by ethnic, religious and cultural diversity. Nazism was a true intellectual movement.","filename":"Kike Liberty","ext":".jpg","w":781,"h":1000,"tn_w":97,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492489627916,"time":1492489627,"md5":"MlrQM\/0jovpF2rk7wdXWQg==","fsize":625781,"resto":121632668,"id":"ajpBr7wX","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"}]},{"posts":[{"no":121628647,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)23:08:20","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Stanistan","com":"What does \/pol\/ think of this thought experiment.<br><br>Stanistan, every country with the name -stan at the end, joins into 1 country, how do you think it&#039;d work out? who&#039;d it be allied with? what would it do?","filename":"Stanistan","ext":".png","w":508,"h":397,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":195,"tim":1492484900078,"time":1492484900,"md5":"gF7ouVvjsJVdGpKO6vt1mQ==","fsize":24230,"resto":0,"id":"dQrXnf8s","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"stanistan","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":82,"images":10,"omitted_posts":77,"omitted_images":10},{"no":121636828,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)00:20:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121628647\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121628647<\/a><br>They&#039;d be blowing each other up constantly just like in every other Muslim shithole","filename":"1488307321513","ext":".gif","w":393,"h":336,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":106,"tim":1492489200623,"time":1492489200,"md5":"aTcWGW5XExRK+PLkrxS\/gQ==","fsize":2488866,"resto":121628647,"id":"ndacZAvo","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":121637031,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)00:21:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121635003\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121635003<\/a><br>could probably do it desu, but what about nukes.<br><a href=\"#p121635016\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121635016<\/a><br>interesting, so you&#039;d take a much more interventionist stance, but that could lead to problems with the military industrial complex leveraging you to keep on invading and conquering, leading to world war pretty quickly.<br><br><a href=\"#p121636223\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121636223<\/a><br>again quite interesting, so a more isolationist approach, with a leaning towards china. this seems like a very likely scenario. <br><br>this thought experiment spurred on so many different types of views, each one forming a radically different nation of stanistan. its quite fascinating","time":1492489303,"resto":121628647,"id":"dQrXnf8s","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121637197,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)00:23:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121631795\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121631795<\/a><br>Why do bongs use shit as an adjective?","time":1492489386,"resto":121628647,"id":"PoRFkdM+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121637600,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)00:26:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121637197\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121637197<\/a><br>everyone uses shit as an adjective.","time":1492489589,"resto":121628647,"id":"dQrXnf8s","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121637656,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)00:27:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"Ignoring the plethora of ethnic and religious divides in the region, if its government could centralize enough to fully exploit its massive amounts of oil and natural resources it could be a major world power, all though none of this will ever happen. <br><br>In reality, eventually sometime in the future (after the US rapes Iran into submission) the US will invade the region for its resources, probably sparking a war with russia and china if these three countries havent already nuked each other yet<br><br>Central Eurasia is (((their))) long-term end game, as their operations in europe, asia and the middle east will all meet in the region one day if (((they))) get their way.

there are many speculations about Turkey, I think as a fellow Kebab I should make a quick summary of what&#039;s happening in Turkey and what probably will happen in the recent future.<br><br>Turkey&#039;s most recent referendum basically gives the president enough power to unironically turn the country into a monarchy and have everything the country offers under his control. Since this is even dangerous for Erdo supporters because there is no knowing who&#039;ll become the new president after he dies, most people voted against this decision. Of course with frauds and in some places with guns the referendum was won with 51%. Though Erdogan won&#039;t have these powers until he get&#039;s elected in the next elections (2019)<br><br>Now even though Erdogan got what he wanted, everyone saw that all the major cities were against this decision and that he didn&#039;t have as much power as he seemed to have. At this moment there are several protests around Turkey just like the Gezi Protests, but it will probably amount to nothing, as usual.<br><br>The possibility of a civil war in Turkey is very unlikely since people there are aware of what happened in Syria. Besides the anti-government side in Turkey is too western compared to those in arab countries. They value their own lives before all else instead of dying for their country and their Allah.<br><br>During the next two years Erdogan will probably make careful moves because he saw that his victory in the next elections isn&#039;t assured. I don&#039;t know what his plan is, but he will probably try to keep the economy stable while also giving the image that he is needed against the enemies(mostly kurds).<br><br>You should expect more strikes on kurds, while also trying to keep USA&#039;s side. People who support Erdogan feel strong hatred against Asad because &quot;he kills innocent muslim babies&quot;, so teaming up with Russia isn&#039;t a choice at this point.","time":1492489615,"resto":121601468,"id":"9h57ALLF","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":121626458,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)22:50:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"It&#039;s been settled that the Aboriginals are the ugliest people roaming earth.

In 2001, Dr. Ariella Oppenheim and her team at Tel Aviv University released their study which found that the \u201cJews\u201d were mainly Khazars, from Khazaria, a Caucasus country which is now called Kazakhstan, Georgia, and other names. The Khazarians converted from pagan religions to talmudic Judaism after the 8th century, but of course, racially they remain Khazars.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The Khazars were and are a genome that is mainly Turkish and Mongolian blood.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Thus today, when you see a \u201cJew,\u201d what you are actually encountering is a Khazar who practices Judaism. The Khazar has no Israelite blood. His ancestors are not the Israelites of the Bible. They did not worship the God, Jehovah, but instead literally were a phallic cult. They worshipped Satan by means of the male penis idol. The Khazars were never in the land of Israel. They are not the seed of Abraham. They have no promise from God. Now we know this as absolute scientific fact.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u201cThere are no blood or family connections among the Jews,\u201d reported Dr. Elhaik. \u201cThe various groups of Jews in the world today do not share a common genetic origin. Their genome is largely Khazar.\u201d<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u201cWhatever Israelite blood the Khazar Jews have,\u201d added Dr. Elhaik, \u201cis miniscule.\u201d<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The facts are: Israel and America are populated by people saying they are Jews who are not Jews! They are Khazarian. When Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu claims, \u201cGod gave this land to our Israelite forefathers,\u201d he is not telling the truth. When today\u2019s Khazar Jews say they possess the land of Israel as a divine right, they are sadly mistaken.<\/span><br><br>tl;dr palestinians have more Israelite DNA than the Khazars LARPing as Jewish descendants of Israelis which is why Jew Palestinian conflict exists. <br>Khazars LARPing as Jews know palestinians are the last remaining Israelites.","time":1492800150,"resto":122156979,"id":"6QxF7+9r","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":122166047,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)14:25:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"Dipping into \/pol\/ to just ask what the chances of a nuclear war are, scary shit happening right now..should I be concerned and build a libertarian style bunker yet?

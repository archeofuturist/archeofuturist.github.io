Anyone with a computer can make so called music now days, every riff imaginable has been done to death, and been copied a million times. The days of growing up with nothing except a radio and a guitar are gone, so innovation has gone out the window with it. The majority of today&#039;s 18yo&#039;s have never seen a band play live that has four guys on their instruments. Bass guitar drums vocals. There is still great music being made today by young people but it isn&#039;t pushed by multi billionaire corporations. They get to see the musical genius of Skrillex. <br><br>Turn off your computer, go see a local band live. And pick up a guitar.

Cooperative deportee might need two escorts, less if if there is more being deported to that destination. If he is violently resisting, who flight plan may become extremely complicated, if captain of next flight refuses to cooperate. They might have to charter that private jet anyway or might have spend few extra days in the operation. Needs at least 4 escorts, requires fuck load of bureaucratic red tape. Especially if flight goes trough third country, since your police officers have no authority in that third country you need to coordinate with local police.

It is literally less than cost of tickets for scheduled flight, before salaries, hotel and other travel costs of police officers involved come into consideration. It might easily save tens of thousands in deportation costs. Principles can become expensive.<br><br>Cheapest deportations are ones where there is lot of cooperating deportees going to same destination country, then chartering entire airliner is cheapest option.

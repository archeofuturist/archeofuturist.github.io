A right is a concept of ownership of something that you cannot be denied under law, not under nature. You have a right to free speech, but in reality communist governments like Obama&#039;s USA or Erdogan in Turkey do not honor those rights and throw journalists in jail. A right from nature is the ownership of your body. Other people stealing your organs is wrong on a level anyone agrees on, except of course organ thieves.<br><br>Usually when I debate leftists, I ask simple questions like &quot;Do you believe in personal property&quot; and &quot;Is stealing morally wrong&quot;, followed by &quot;If you have a need, do you get to steal&quot; which then of course leads to criminal tax systems which rob people through the power of the government.<br><br>While I agree with the sentiment of what you&#039;re saying, it needlessly obfuscates the moral questions you&#039;re posing. Most leftists are not very intelligent. It is better to have them paint themselves into a corner by showing them that their own beliefs are contradictory.

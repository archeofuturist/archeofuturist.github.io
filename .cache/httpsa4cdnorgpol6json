In Taiwan, where Lim was born, all of his siblings have bidets as well. \u201cIt looks strange if you don\u2019t have it,\u201d Lim told Fox News.<br><br>A bidet is a plumbing fixture or sink used for washing genitalia and, while widely used in places like Asia, the Middle East, and Europe, they are not customary in the United States.<br><br>A bidet to put it simply is a what should clean your rear end after the food you ate exits your body. Instead of toilet paper a bidet shoots a stream of water in order to clean your butt. If you had mud on your driveway would you rather wipe it off with newspaper or take out the pressure washer?<br><br>The idea of using a bidet may be foreign to many Americans but it the norm in many countries. Did you know that 97% of homes in Italy have a bidet? Other European countries and Japan also has a very high rate of bidet use.<br><br>Many countries are just starting to widely use toilets, in fact 70% of people in India do not have access to a toilet.

There are many minority Muslim sects, Christian sects, and ethnic groups in Syria. Beyond the national socialist Ba&#039;athist party, the only solution to make every body happy, is Balkanization... Which is what globalists want... Multi-culturalism in the West, and fractured, homogenous, bickering regions every where else in the world. Divide to rule. By the way I have the numbers on the division of power by sect in front of me, if you want to know more.","time":1491789387,"resto":120368909,"id":"++jxdhK\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":120365592,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)20:46:04","name":"Anonymous","sub":"I figured it all out.

His administration has been infiltrated by the NWO, who is now feeding him false information to try to force him to start another war. This all started when Trump picked Mike Flynn and Kathleen McFarland as National Security Advisors. Mike Flynn was quickly forced to resign after a fake scandal was created around his leaked phone call. It is now known that said leak came from Obama holdovers who were spying on the Trump campaign all along, and it would seem purposefully targeted Flynn specifically.<br><br>Trump then (((selected))) H.R. McMaster to fill the vacancy. A conehead, warmongering lunatic who is a member of the CFR, and whose hiring was even praised by McCain (who HATES Trump.) A month and a half of him feeding Trump bullshit passes and all of a sudden Trump is on board with bombing Syria and North Korea. Even worse, today McMaster fired Kathleen McFarland, Trump&#039;s original pick for Deputy National Security Advisor, further expanding the globalist coup of the Trump administration.<br><br>According to Mike Cernovich, McMaster has been falsifying information to Trump in order to force him into a war with Syria: https:\/\/medium.com\/@Cernovich\/h-r-m<wbr>cmaster-manipulating-intelligence-r<wbr>eports-to-trump-wants-150-000-groun<wbr>d-soldiers-in-syria-83346c433e99<br><br>Please spread the word about this.

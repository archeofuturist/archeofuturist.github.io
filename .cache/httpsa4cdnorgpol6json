The bible is contradicted multiple times by evolution (garden of eden) , biology (endless flood, animals praying, having belly bottons, etc.), logic (if god knows your future, there is no free will).<br><br>And even if Jehova, the christian god existed, he deserves no praise as a someone perfectly good.<br>(Turning a woman into salt, murdering an entire town, regretting to flood the human race when he knows the future, giving adam and eve a test he knows they will fail, sending people to hell when they have no freedom to change their destiny, sending people who had no access to information about him to hell, taking sides in human wars, having a favourite group of people, literally punishing adam and eve for getting knowledge, brainwashing people in heaven into abandoning their personality and previous memories, sending his own son to a suicide mission, sending good people to hell just because they were not christian, and a long etc.)<br><br>In conclusion, there MIGHT be A god around. There is no debunking or even proving that.<br><br>But the Christian God? He is not real. <br>It contradicts many of the rules of nature and simple logic that rules our understanding.","filename":"1490712606678","ext":".jpg","w":829,"h":1024,"tn_w":202,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490712942860,"time":1490712942,"md5":"bmMm90aMtGtTJHgYnLor4g==","fsize":203672,"resto":0,"id":"RMHu6q25","country":"MX","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"god","trip":"!v1vo7V1AeY","country_name":"Mexico","replies":73,"images":6,"omitted_posts":68,"omitted_images":6},{"no":118667785,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)12:50:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118667554\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118667554<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;OK so what is the test if something is moral or immoral<\/span><br>watch your response to it","time":1490719841,"resto":118656092,"id":"Bl6nIyAu","country":"CZ","country_name":"Czech Republic"},{"no":118667863,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)12:51:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118667785\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118667785<\/a><br>Different people respond different ways","time":1490719891,"resto":118656092,"id":"vs+LcxCG","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118668144,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)12:54:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118667554\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118667554<\/a><br><a href=\"#p118667412\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118667412<\/a><br>Morality evolved WITH God which is why it is immutable.

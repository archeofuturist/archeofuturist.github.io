His teachings are still considered an important reference and a guide among Pro-European leaders. What&#039;s happening right now in Europe, with the refugee crisis and everything else, can be traced down and mostly explained by what this man laid down almost a century ago. It&#039;s not a secret, they are totally open about it, a lot of people just don&#039;t care.<br><br>Here you have the script of Practical Idealism from Richard Coudenhove-Kalergi:<br>https:\/\/archive.fo\/QGdrU<br><br>Kalergi on the &quot;man of the future&quot; and destroying diversity:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The man of the future will be of mixed race. Today&#039;s races and classes will gradually disappear owing to the vanishing of space, time, and prejudice. The Eurasian-Negroid race of the future, similar in its appearance to the Ancient Egyptians, will replace the diversity of peoples with a diversity of individuals. <\/span><br><br>The comparison with the British:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The precursor of the planetary man of the future is the Russian Slavic-Tatar-Finnish mongrel of modern Europe; because he, among all the peoples of Europe, is the race of the typical multi-soul people with a wide ranging, encompassing soul. His strongest antipode is the insular Briton, the highly bred single minded man whose strength typically lies in the character, in the will - he provides modern Europe with the most closed, perfect type: the Gentleman.<\/span>","filename":"1480798698066","ext":".jpg","w":960,"h":960,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490427171989,"time":1490427171,"md5":"Vj+4\/GNuLgf2Y53R96o5vg==","fsize":161185,"resto":0,"id":"hFBTOkR+","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-european-unions-kalergi-plan-and-the-refugee","country_name":"Canada","replies":41,"images":30,"omitted_posts":36,"omitted_images":28},{"no":118220425,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)08:38:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Dhk<wbr>ocrEpaak","filename":"1477912223210","ext":".png","w":648,"h":774,"tn_w":104,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490445491799,"time":1490445491,"md5":"6rBk9C\/OttBWMHFjscYvFQ==","fsize":341397,"resto":118200584,"id":"hFBTOkR+","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118222341,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)09:05:05","name":"Anonymous","filename":"1401144134535","ext":".jpg","w":2456,"h":1672,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":85,"tim":1490447105772,"time":1490447105,"md5":"YSZ7fJ+DQl1g8RTJk2s+DA==","fsize":1063737,"resto":118200584,"id":"hFBTOkR+","country":"CA","m_img":1,"country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118223189,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)09:17:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a

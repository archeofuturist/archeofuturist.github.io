And this must be this year guys. There are several things which are happening actually and in the near future. War conflicts around the world (syria, urkaine, northkorea) which could escelate tonight or in one month but a big world war is our future, nobody can lie this. In addition, the international finance fiat system is close to his collapse. Europe becomes invaded by sandniggers and the usa are so damn broke and splitted into two groups. riots and angry people around the world, massive and decreasing count of weather and nature crysis (flooding, vulcanes, earrhquake and more). The whole nature and creation is dieing and with it our humanity and society. Why are you guys all so blind its so obvious, the 1% wants to rule the world with their master luzifer. all those knowledge combined results nothing good.. and remeber the bible prophecy! forget the kek face which is hidden from google.sky, the most important thing is the raw star constellation and his message! god is coming soon! prepare your soul, make piece with your enemys, your soul and yourself.

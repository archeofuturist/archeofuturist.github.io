I don&#039;t mean that as a meme, I mean it literally. Let me explain. <br><br>The main reason Jews still exist (ethnically) is that the Jewish birthright passes through the mother to her children. This is unlike most cultures, where tribal identity passes through the father.<br><br>It&#039;s quite a clever trick -- the result is that over the centuries, they have used their best women to seduce high-IQ gentiles and steal all the best genes for their ethnocult. At the same time, low-value Jewish males are either left unmarried or have to marry gentiles. This means their offspring are no longer Jewish and their genetics are removed from the pool.<br><br>Constant theft of both genes and cultural power from outgroup males -- that is the real essence of their ethnocult. The religious trappings are just a defense mechanism. <br><br>The Jewish men must marry a Jewish woman to have their kids remain Jewish, and this makes them highly competitive. It also ensures that almost all Jewish women have suitors. These women then have more social value, meaning the top tier can easily attract high-IQ gentiles. They have Jewish children, and the process has completed an iteration.<br><br>There are drawbacks to having this system. For one, it means a Jewish father cannot marry off his daughter to settle a debt or forge an alliance unless the man is Jewish or willing to have his kids be Jewish. In practice, this mandates the suitor join the woman&#039;s family. This is wholly incompatible with the dowry customs that were in place throughout the West until very recently, and are socially relevant even still.<br><br>This explains why:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Jews are resented in every era<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Jews are often depicted as bloodsuckers, even when not in banking (they&#039;re sucking bloodlines)<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Jews are genetically smarter (or at the very least craftier) than the average gentile<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;a new population of Jews invariably infiltrates and takes over a country&#039;s elite within a few generations<\/span>","filename":"f18ffdcaf3451d30e9419cef03073f8c1fed2f322e71b6750f2f864f8467bd97","ext":".png","w":1302,"h":444,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":85,"tim":1492598662475,"time":1492598662,"md5":"R4ZGascsNRLBH37WMNE9bA==","fsize":137124,"resto":0,"id":"2qHobpcI","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"what-are-jews","country_name":"United States","replies":14,"images":6,"omitted_posts":9,"omitted_images":3},{"no":121832473,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)07:13:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121831187\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121831187<\/a>","filename":"subversive","ext":".jpg","w":400,"h":400,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492600403314,"time":1492600403,"md5":"fQycNk6Xtg7JH98HOpwY1A==","fsize":93600,"resto":121830457,"id":"jtv4r983","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":121833313,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)07:24:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"Bump","time":1492601068,"resto":121830457,"id":"2qHobpcI","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121834073,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)07:34:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"bumpp","filename":"1490559959479","ext":".png","w":1198,"h":1357,"tn_w":110,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492601665173,"time":1492601665,"md5":"ffQJt+olKADcZYpYMegxbQ==","fsize":2210162,"resto":121830457,"id":"pQxUX8pE","country":"GB","m_img":1,"country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121834198,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)07:35:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121830457\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121830457<\/a><br>bump","time":1492601757,"resto":121830457,"id":"lq5KgFLh","country":"RO","country_name":"Romania"},{"no":121834255,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)07:36:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121830457\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121830457<\/a><br>Whatever shill.

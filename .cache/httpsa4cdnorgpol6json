(post proof later)<br><br>In this thread, I\u2019m going to break down all the information, try and separate the signal from the noise and look at exactly what Le Pen\u2019s chances of winning are. Apologies if the formatting is pretty shit I don\u2019t post much but I thought I\u2019d share because you guys seem interested in this election. If you\u2019re thinking of betting or just interested, you might want to strap in because this will be a long one.","filename":"161114152205-marine-le-pen-france-flag-super-tease","ext":".jpg","w":1100,"h":619,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1493851206488,"time":1493851206,"md5":"XDhEXu7iME6uDzuWqxgBwA==","fsize":118086,"resto":0,"id":"BkBgs0dF","country":"GB","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"complete-guide-to-the-french-election","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":33,"images":16,"omitted_posts":28,"omitted_images":14},{"no":123985875,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)19:48:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123977345\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123977345<\/a><br>Any effect would have been caught in round 1.

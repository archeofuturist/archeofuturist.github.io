Human nature is not &quot;equality seeking&quot;... it&#039;s the same as the law of nature.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;kill or be killed, evolution and heirarchy<\/span><br>Kill or be killed is correct, When you&#039;re not given the opportunity and are forced to starve, you fight back and take it. This has happened over and over again. It&#039;s against human nature to just roll over and die without a struggle just because some exploited you. Our country is living proof of this.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;he banks dictate the path, corporations are simply along for the ride, just like you and me.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;even if they get a slight head start<\/span><br>This is a completely valid point. The only issue is that workers have no power to deal with investors. A worker must push against the company and the company must push against it&#039;s investors. That is the main issue with capitalism is that it&#039;s a pyramid scheme.","filename":"07","ext":".jpg","w":321,"h":480,"tn_w":83,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490085740793,"time":1490085740,"md5":"TYpLqlfKsWncsJRu+BEl9g==","fsize":63934,"resto":117594461,"id":"zlLEsZxq","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117606391,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)04:47:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117598095\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117598095<\/a><br>Was your dad Winston Churchill or just a plagarist","filename":"quote-show-me-a-young-conservative-and-i-ll-show-you-someone-with-no-heart-show-me-an-old-winston-churchill-36-78-85","ext":".jpg","w":850,"h":400,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":58,"tim":1490086037300,"time":1490086037,"md5":"zPIc2LvjL2PXhzgCDr6Nbw==","fsize":71635,"resto":117594461,"id":"9XQExuS1","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"}]},{"posts":[{"no":117606385,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)04:47:10","name":"Anonymous","sub":"18C","com":"Will 18C changes go forward?

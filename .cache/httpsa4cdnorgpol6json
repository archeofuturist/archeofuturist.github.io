A communist system would thus free individuals from alienation in the sense of having one&#039;s life structured around survival (making a wage or salary in a capitalist system), which Marx referred to as a transition from the &quot;realm of necessity&quot; to the &quot;realm of freedom.&quot; As a result, a communist society is envisioned as being composed of an intellectually-inclined population with both the time and resources to pursue its creative hobbies and genuine interests, and to contribute to creative social wealth in this manner. Karl Marx considered &quot;true richness&quot; to be the amount of time one has at his or her disposal to pursue one&#039;s creative passions.Marx&#039;s notion of communism is in this way radically individualistic.","filename":"223f0bc9ecc3a458ea60e8365e9384ea5b7c52c71ab2598194c0ca3afb5f688e","ext":".jpg","w":650,"h":836,"tn_w":97,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490786234031,"time":1490786234,"md5":"rzp+48\/wcwOAMmxnFb29cA==","fsize":76679,"resto":118769075,"id":"15moBzPr","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":118776791,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)07:42:36","name":"Anonymous","filename":"karl_marx_quote_2","ext":".jpg","w":400,"h":262,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":81,"tim":1490787756340,"time":1490787756,"md5":"iH8pMCDMKS4gZCFuPlKG+w==","fsize":53153,"resto":118769075,"id":"15moBzPr","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":118777112,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)07:46:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118773503\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118773503<\/a><br>BRAAAAAAP!! <br>*[gassing of bourgeois and reactionaries intensifies]","time":1490787989,"resto":118769075,"id":"ThJkvQfU","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":118777639,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)07:53:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118774928\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118774928<\/a><br>This is why Franco shot the Republicans.

I don&#039;t see the advantages, even the all the EU legislations where - even if annoying - kind of minor and now over 20000 legislations have to be revised, lots of stuff has to be rebuilt from scratch. <br><br>And no, I don&#039;t let the &quot;keep your mudslimes, niggers EU!&quot; etc. as an argument, Britain has always accepted lots of poos and other foreigners to their country and they will neither stop doing this nor throw out who is already there because of Brexit. Even if people wished it would happen this has almost nothing to do with Brexit, and is still a decision of the same government that decided to keep them and let them in before.<br><br>And &quot;I don&#039;t want to be ruled by Merkel!&quot; is not an argument either since she has almost no fucking say in Brit politics, she never had.

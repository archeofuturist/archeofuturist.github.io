They told me they did this to help ease their hunger pains. Quickly they grew emaciated. Dysentery raged, and soon they were sleeping in their own excrement, too weak and crowded to reach the slit trenches. Many were begging for food, sickening and dying before our eyes. We had ample food and supplies, but did nothing to help them, including no medical assistance.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Outraged, I protested to my officers and was met with hostility or bland indifference.

Realizing my protests were useless, I asked a friend working in the kitchen if he could slip me some extra food for the prisoners. He too said they were under strict orders to severely ration the prisoners&#039; food, and that these orders came from &quot;higher up.&quot; But he said they had more food than they knew what to do with, and would sneak me some.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;When I threw this food over the barbed wire to the prisoners, I was caught and threatened with imprisonment. I repeated the &quot;offense,&quot; and one officer angrily threatened to shoot me. I assumed this was a bluff until I encountered a captain on a hill above the Rhine shooting down at a group of German civilian women with his .45 caliber pistol. When I asked, &quot;Why?,&quot; he mumbled, &quot;Target practice,&quot; and fired until his pistol was empty.

It&#039;s originally a Jewish sect. Later adopted and perverted European traditions and beliefs and incorporated them so the Europeans could adopt to the new religion easier. At first Christianity was a very strong factor in European society because of the warrior mentality of the people and the everlasting wars against the Turks and the wars that Europeans fought against each other. Christianity destroyed the spiritual essence and original European beliefs and replacing them with a code of laws which originated from a semitic tribe which developed and evolved differently and under different circumstances then the free Europeans. The Bible and it&#039;s 10 commandments as well as the whole concept hasn&#039;t made Europeans spiritually stronger or richer or more enlightened. It actually made us spiritually impotent, and unable to follow our basic instincts and not living to our full potential. <br>Jewish influence in Christianity has never been greater then it is today. All the Churches in the USA for example are zionist. The protestant churches of Europe, especially in Germany, England and Scandinavia are more like zionist\/Soros payed NGO&#039;s then religious institutions. The Vatican itself with the Pope is a nest of Jewish agenda, especially since the 1960&#039;s. The orthodox church had always strong ties to the old testament-jewish traditions.<br>Christianity is basically a religious, jewish based ideology, just as communism is jewish political ideology. Both communism and christianity have strong characteristics of judaism itself. Internationalism, a borderless world, no regard for religious, cultural, ethnic, racial or other borders. Bolshevism was anti christian not because it was a religion that stood in the way of communists, but rather because the orthodox christianity in Russia was a state controled institution and very Russian-based.","time":1492636395,"resto":121880559,"id":"bsw9Ywno","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":121898366,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)17:21:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121897031\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121897031<\/a><br><br>sure. keep thinking that you can earn in any way or contribute to your way to heaven. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Isaiah 45:9 What sorrow awaits those who argue with their Creator.

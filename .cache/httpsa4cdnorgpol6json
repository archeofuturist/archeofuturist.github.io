However, I appreciate that there is far more scope for a difference of opinion between non-radical, \u201cmoderate\u201d people here than the IMO highly authoritarian bias. I also feel that this proposition is worded with a little clever conservative bias since Agreement requires one to describe people as \u201cfoolish\u201d, a rather harsh adjective, when \u201cpuzzling\u201d or \u201cmyopic\u201d might have been easier to Agree to. Nevertheless, I stick with my tick.<br><br>Pride is an ugly sentiment, unbecoming of one who seeks to understand the world. There is, of course, nothing wrong with appreciating, liking or even loving a given country (whether or not it is where you were born); its culture, its rich history, the characteristics of its people you find endearing etc. And one can certainly enjoy singing a \u201cnational\u201d song or cheering a sports team wearing \u201cnational\u201d colours along with people you consider to share a bond with. One might even be proud to represent one\u2019s country in some way, since it demonstrates some level of excellence or ability which one has personally attained.<br><br>But being proud of one\u2019s country? This entails an unhealthy \u201cthem and us\u201d mentality, perhaps even a feeling of superiority which is, I believe, outright dangerous. And everyone has to be born somewhere - what word describes somebody who is proud of the geographical location of their birth?<br><br>\u201cFool\u201d, I say.

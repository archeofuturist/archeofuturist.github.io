The Chinese government makes California look like Texas. Furthermore, they risk IP theft virtually at all times. Bootleg products aren&#039;t just iPhones and luxury handbags, but full on cars and other consumer durables as well. Finally, there&#039;s always the risk of nationalization. This isn&#039;t really present in China, but you can be kicked out at a moment&#039;s notice. Think more so the General Motors plant in Venezuela though. On top of all these risks, you have shipping costs that have to get paid. <br><br>However, the cheap labor of these countries typically covers these costs. But if we in the West automated our manufacturing facilities, would we still be able to maintain a competitive edge over the rest of the world in manufacturing? <br><br>For instance, Japan and Germany both have massive manufacturing industries, but they aren&#039;t working for peanuts. They have highly skilled workforces and are the cutting-edge of the technological industry. Yes, Japan does have some benefit from currency manipulation and the same is true of Germany, but currency manipulation isn&#039;t everything, after all, if that were true then Zimbabwe should theoretically be a global powerhouse. So could automation make us a manufacturing leader again?","filename":"automation ","ext":".jpg","w":277,"h":182,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":164,"tim":1493619846781,"time":1493619846,"md5":"rDUeXLhfM+jZE3PYvD1jOA==","fsize":18175,"resto":0,"id":"VMhlCMA4","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"is-automation-the-solution-to-our-manufacturing","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":1},{"no":123587976,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)02:25:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123587854\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123587854<\/a><br><br>It ain&#039;t gonna bring back millions of jobs tho","time":1493619937,"resto":123587854,"id":"nv1mVKMc","country":"AR","country_name":"Argentina"},{"no":123588891,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)02:37:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123587854\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123587854<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;mfw rape factories<\/span>","filename":"Kleo","ext":".png","w":1516,"h":1080,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":89,"tim":1493620666804,"time":1493620666,"md5":"bqjX3fiUT4VP89OzeAYDrw==","fsize":1032203,"resto":123587854,"id":"GRbIrvBa","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":123572218,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)23:32:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"how many of you has accomplished everything on this list?","filename":"list","ext":".jpg","w":480,"h":480,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493609520177,"time":1493609520,"md5":"THSAgZg2RofssVrlyS2wlg==","fsize":27468,"resto":0,"id":"kc14ExPs","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"how-many-of-you-has-accomplished-everything-on","country_name":"United States","replies":190,"images":27,"omitted_posts":185,"omitted_images":27,"tail_size":50},{"no":123588357,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)02:30:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123572773\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123572773<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;put money in the back<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;dont pay attention to monthly statement<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;bank starts stealing 35 dollars out of my account each month because i refuse to get electronic service<\/span><br><br>oey vey.","time":1493620233,"resto":123572218,"id":"1k\/cL+Ac","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123588411,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)02:31:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123572760\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123572760<\/a><br>Can you give me your address please anon and which mattress you sleep on.<br>Asking for a m8.","filename":"0eebdafde5fb8d5fcae8ba736370e30a","ext":".png","w":720,"h":400,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":69,"tim":1493620269374,"time":1493620269,"md5":"pzmqxBQ+9Kjl4cLBa7sXNQ==","fsize":414006,"resto":123572218,"id":"b1LqhZOR","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":123588465,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)02:31:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123588142\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123588142<\/a><br>This guy clearly didn&#039;t accomplish number 9 yet","time":1493620312,"resto":123572218,"id":"Fm0i0vDW","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":123588677,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)02:34:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123587265\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123587265<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I live solely for myself<\/span><br><br>Then there&#039;s nothing I can do for you.<br><br>But let me ask you this in relation to your other statement.<br><br>Do you know who Alexander the Great was? Just a man born 2,353 years ago who we still know and talk about, that&#039;s all.<br><br>As far as I see it, providing for others is not a waste of my life. In providing for others, I provide for myself. I am the neighbor I want to have. I am the father I would want to have. I am the boss I would want to have.

I know people who would be willing to help me in almost any way they possibly could and they are not related to me in any way. Because I helped them when they needed it most.

If I get a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction from helping people I believe are deserving of help, is that not in-and-of-itself meaning? <br><br>And let me ask you this? Does any life whatsoever have meaning? If this life has no meaning, then why does it exist? Happenstance? Totally random? Are we in a simulation? Does God exist? Did He ever exist? Why have so many people all across the world chosen to believe in Gods? Why have there never been so few tribes to ever be atheistic?

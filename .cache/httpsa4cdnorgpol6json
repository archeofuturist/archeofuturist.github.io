I thought it was a joke at first, but then I got banned for just posting in a meme thread, so apparently they&#039;re super cereal about getting rid of the shitposters, which I applaud.<br><br>So the first thing you&#039;re going to want to do, very simple, remove flags. Ever since you added them they have cause NOTHING but shitposting. &gt;a fucking leaf &gt;poo in loo &gt;RARERERARERARAREARERARERARE Seriously, it make a community where you judged people by the content of their arguments into an \/int\/ tier shithole. The worst part is the flags that play up to their stereotypes, like Canadians making abhorrent posts. I don&#039;t know if you unironically thought they made the community better or not but quite frankly I thought they were a one time meme addition as a joke. If you really want to include flags then have a drop down menu of selectable ideological flags, like it used to be.<br><br>Increase post timers. This one&#039;s a no brainer. Again, I thought it was a one time joke but you kept it, you literally gave spammers the tools to shit the board up and then are surprised when they do it. Along with this, make sure someone can only have one, maybe two active threads at a time. This will slow down the people spamming BLACKED threads.<br><br>Legitimize generals. The best threads on \/pol\/ right now are brit\/pol\/ and \/sg\/, and this is largely because they have both a sense of community and don&#039;t have flagposters baiting for (You)s. The best thing you could do is increase the post limit for these, to 700, like \/vg\/. This would also allow in depth discussion in other threads and promote actual conversation, it would also mean we wouldn&#039;t have to make new generals every half an hour.<br><br>Thanks for listening and I hope you take this into account, you can make \/pol\/ usable again. <br><br><br>pls no re-ban i wuz trying to help i a gud boi i dindu nuffin","filename":"Based jannies","ext":".jpg","w":1127,"h":329,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":72,"tim":1493442007933,"time":1493442007,"md5":"lH4EQvN7NZpm6Wi1A9WxMA==","fsize":164185,"resto":0,"id":"X0L1O9x+","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"how-to-make-pol-great-again","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":12,"images":3,"omitted_posts":7,"omitted_images":1},{"no":123300448,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)01:30:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"MODS! <br>Ban this delinquent hooligan.","time":1493443859,"resto":123297962,"id":"+PP2eWg1","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123301803,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)01:46:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123298483\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123298483<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;a fucking petal<\/span><br>The only reason you want them is because your flag gives you attention, literally proving my point.<br><a href=\"#p123298535\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123298535<\/a><br>A FUCKING LEAF<br><a href=\"#p123299538\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123299538<\/a><br><a href=\"#p123300294\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123300294<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;what is ironic self awareness<\/span><br>Keep up, lads.

It was pretty advanced for its time. <br><br>X.com was created because Musk figured out how to make a shitload of money off manipulating currency, but no one was willing to do it. He was going to become a banker around this time. However, as the internet continued to become ever more popular and no bank was willing to act on his plan, he decided that he&#039;d make his own bank - online. Unfortunately Thiel came up with PayPal and started to act, not in the capacity of a bank, but merely an intermediary for transactions. Which is what X.com also did, and it eventually forced the merger, and then killed off the whole digital bank thing. Which sucks because Musk was actually toying with crypto-currency ideas way before Bitcoin. <br><br>NASA? He didn&#039;t invent NASA, but if you mean SpaceX. Okay. SpaceX was founded as a cheap way to get rockets into space. This was the entire basis of the Falcon 1. Problematically, they couldn&#039;t find enough people who needed a launch vehicle of that size. The market simply didn&#039;t exist as they thought it did, which forced them into changing the Falcon 1 into the Falcon 9 and becoming company focused on launching medium payloads into all orbits, and heavy payloads into LEO. Then they expanded this into the FH. <br><br>Electric Cars is actually why Musk went to Yale. He was going to go work on a double degree in Physics and Engineering because he liked supercapacitors. However, his brother convinced him to drop out and start Zip2 with him. <br><br>Solar Energy wasn&#039;t his idea, it was his two cousin&#039;s. He just recognized there was a lot of converging elements between the battery tech for the cars, and the solar energy market. <br><br>Then he helped found OpenAI after talking to a few ex-Google employees and Nick Bostrom. And he bank rolls them accordingly. This is his second biggest concern, next to getting people to Mars. The Mars dream stretches all the way back to when he sold Zip2.","time":1493445403,"resto":123298153,"id":"XZEYmDDY","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":123288423,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)23:15:42","name":"Anonymous","sub":"A cornered enemy has nothing to lose","com":"attacking him is the absolute wrong choice, how can the US not see this?","filename":"kim-jong-un-image04","ext":".jpg","w":720,"h":720,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493435742355,"time":1493435742,"md5":"TkATIryeyww34al\/\/YqrUQ==","fsize":49799,"resto":0,"id":"pbKlOgGF","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"a-cornered-enemy-has-nothing-to-lose","country_name":"United States","replies":94,"images":15,"omitted_posts":89,"omitted_images":15},{"no":123301706,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)01:45:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"Kek says &quot;Come&quot;.

Another thing to consider is environment, over time due to the nature of European environments these Africans have to contend with colder weather and less stable climates, meaning they have to develop evolutionarily the same mentality the way races living in more challenging environments did in regards to thinking ahead, building, clothing. Overtime as well dressing in full body clothing for long parts of the year in more cold areas like Canada will over generations decrease the prevalence of melanin production in skin.

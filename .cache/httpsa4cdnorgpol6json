His most famous experiment, the mouse universe, was created in July 1968. Four pairs of mice were introduced into the habitat. The habitat was a 9-footsquare metal pen. There was no shortage of food or water or nesting material. There were no predators. The only adversity was the limit on space.<br><br>Initially, the population grew rapidly, doubling every 55 days. The period between day 315 and day 600 saw a breakdown in social structure and in normal social behavior. Among the aberrations in behavior were the following: expulsion of young before weaning was complete, wounding of young, increase in homosexual behavior, inability of dominant males to maintain the defense of their territory, aggressive behavior of females, and extreme passivity of non-dominant males.<br><br>After day 600, the social breakdown continued and the population declined toward extinction. During this period females ceased to reproduce. Their male counterparts withdrew completely, never engaging in courtship or fighting. They ate, drank, slept, and groomed themselves \u2013 all solitary pursuits. Sleek, healthy coats and an absence of scars characterized these males. They were dubbed &quot;the beautiful ones.&quot; Breeding never resumed and behavior patterns were permanently changed and the mouse population slowly died out.<br><br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/John_<wbr>B._Calhoun<br><br>g-g-guys...

Why should God be better than us?&#039; Think about it a bit more, and then you tell me. We were created in the image of God; in the beginning God, walked among us. Why can we no longer, in our natural state, walk with God? Why are we kept separate from Him, made to follow laws to which he is not subject? This is because we have fallen short; we have become less, and now we need to be governed, else the evil aspects of our nature destroy all of creation entirely.<br><br>Let&#039;s consider even more: despite the fact that there&#039;s no reason for God to follow these rules, he chose to condescend in the form of Jesus to spend time on this earth following all of God&#039;s rules.

If you claim that your only sin is against God, you still lie. <br><br>The purpose of Jesus&#039; incarnation and death is simply the defeat of sin. If we commune with Christ, and if we are born of the Spirit, the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of God--the Spirit of Christ who overcame sin--resides in us, and we ourselves are given the power to overcome sin. As it was said, God became like us so that we might become like Him.

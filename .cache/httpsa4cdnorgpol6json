He tossed him outside again, and he literally lay there on his side trembling for hours. <br><br>When he finally let him inside, he could barely walk and refused to even look at him. He spent the next three days curled up beside the couch, only moving to go outside or get something to drink. Then he was fine, but he does his business outside.

Contrary to what the Anglo-Saxon savage has taught you, Celtic nations are not exclusive to the British Isles, in fact we are one of the most diverse group of peoples in Western Europe, ranging from Asturias all the way to Breizh.

He also has a facebook account (as Wira Thu) where he is shitposting, for example a photo of a toilet bowl with muslim books inside. <br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=v4r<wbr>vtnTThq0<br><br>On a sidenote, isn&#039;t it interesting that monasticism has only been developed in Europe and east Asia? There are plenty of black and shitskin preachers, but preacher is quite a different animal. His goal is to attract followers through swag, while monks try to achieve wisdom through contemplation. Seems like some people just aren&#039;t cut out for a life marked by strict regulations and mental discipline.","filename":"ashin","ext":".jpg","w":320,"h":320,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492169992621,"time":1492169992,"md5":"yakqGgMefHtbVILutGe\/8g==","fsize":25191,"resto":0,"id":"3fTjo0RV","country":"HR","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"ashin-wirathu-a-hero-of-the-free-world","country_name":"Croatia","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":121050585,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)07:39:49","name":"Anonymous","sub":"\/ournews\/","com":"To my Androidfags in the house, just found this app:<br><br>A consolidated feed of Breitbart, ZeroHedge, Fox, and AP stories all in one app.<br><br>\/ourapp\/ confirmed.<br><br>(I&#039;m not the creator of this app, just thought I&#039;d let you in on it.)<br><br>https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/<wbr>details?id=com.ml.BreitHedge","filename":"Screenshot_20170414-073259","ext":".png","w":1080,"h":1920,"tn_w":140,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492169989692,"time":1492169989,"md5":"TcV\/tcDVr7grAIs6PxJ8cg==","fsize":151576,"resto":0,"id":"dhw7wbfS","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"ournews","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":121046869,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)06:50:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"What&#039;s your favorite Trump documentary?","filename":"am_00t91794qfflt3588_1300x1733","ext":".jpg","w":1216,"h":1733,"tn_w":175,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492167013927,"time":1492167013,"md5":"eevShT4c1SkyF2rwfO9jMg==","fsize":488185,"resto":0,"id":"HR\/0sgm6","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"whats-your-favorite-trump-documentary","country_name":"United States","replies":3,"images":1},{"no":121047899,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)07:04:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121046869\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121046869<\/a><br>that is actually interesting observation about CIA lemon party gestapo where even war equals peace. CIA homos declared that all your bases are belong to us about the same time they established NAMBLA. So times of Clinton presiidency were very turbulent just like any other if looking from &quot;stonewalling of the lambs&quot; position. Notice Clinton is portrayed as womanized, but in reality it&#039;s most likely the other way around. They needed this PR narrative to distance from voes about little boy prostitutes late night visits to whitehouse during reagan presidency. So that was another reason why Gennifer Flowers psyop was implemented right away. Clinton worked very similar ANGLE angling template as obongo as far as Gandhi non violent resistance goes. Only he used disabled americans for targeting. Remember all those wheelchair accessible toilets? Don&#039;t Ask Don&#039;t tell anyone anything. Loose lips wrapped around rainbow whistles sink ships.

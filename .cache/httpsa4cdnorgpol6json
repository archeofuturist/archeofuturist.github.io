Another senate bill authored by the same pair of ambitious religious freedom fighters would allow people employed in any of Texas&#039;s 65 licensed occupations to refuse service to people if those folks violate their SHRB.<br><br>So, for example, private medical providers wouldn&#039;t really have to help trans patients if they assert that being transgender violates their SHRB; barbers wouldn&#039;t have to cut gay people&#039;s hair if they didn&#039;t feel like it; plumbers could let toilets overflow and electricians could keep people in the dark if they happened to religiously disagree with the customer&#039;s sexual orientation. And the bill would prohibit the state from disciplining them for any of this.<br><br>Other bills allow wedding-industry businesses, such as cake makers and florists, to refuse service to LGBT couples (HB 2876 by Rep. Scott Sanford), allow &quot;conscientious refusal&quot; of healthcare services of any kind based moral beliefs (HB 2878 by Sanford) and allow child welfare service providers to refuse to take in LGBT kids (SB 892\u2014also by Senator Perry).<br><br>None of these bills has made significant headway in the Lege, at least not yet. The so-called bathroom bill, SB 6, has passed in the Senate, but its future is far less certain in the house. A House substitute, HB 2899, is less restrictive than SB 6 and does not include provisions about requiring school districts and cities to enforce bathroom bills based on biological sex, but prohibits jurisdictions from passing trans-inclusive bathroom policies.

But of course, if this about the Ottoman Empire than we&#039;re talking the end of the 12th century to 20 oct 1923.<br><br>They had immense importance in spreading knowledge throughout the world by forcing scholars to flee to more stable regions in Europe and around the Mediterranean sea. Only few Arab (Muslim) dynasties ever cared for science and secular thought, which lead to the myth of an &quot;Islamic golden age&quot;. <br><br>Most of that mythical age persisted in both Muslim Spain and Levant for few constant decades before collapsing for whichever reason (Often internal struggle and struggles with external Muslim dynasties). This were repeated throughout till today; of course they were beaten to a pulp by many different peoples such as the Mongols that did destroy a lot of knowledge and seats of learning and preservation of texts.","filename":"AnimeEmoBrah","ext":".png","w":452,"h":710,"tn_w":79,"tn_h":124,"tim":1493264751737,"time":1493264751,"md5":"oHykfGSMOfwb4XZV5o2dbA==","fsize":286771,"resto":122970245,"id":"HIuF0WeW","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":122992859,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)00:10:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122970245\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122970245<\/a><br>If you had oil under your feet you&#039;d be rich as fuck too you dumb kike nigger!","time":1493266236,"resto":122970245,"id":"Z33AkSZt","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":122992848,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)00:10:33","name":"Anonymous","sub":"What does \/pol\/ think of the WoT?","com":"Yay or gay?","filename":"01-The-Eye-of-the-World-outside","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":752,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":183,"tim":1493266233565,"time":1493266233,"md5":"qwnB9a9FDLiLF6IDORQMLQ==","fsize":283572,"resto":0,"id":"3NuthXV9","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"what-does-pol-think-of-the-wot","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0},{"no":122993021,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)00:12:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"saged because of sage","time":1493266337,"resto":122992848,"id":"TDGK3LSE","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":122982076,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)22:38:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"What are some redpilled animu, \/pol\/?<br><br>Pic related is a definite.<br><br>Saga of Tanya the Evil (Youjo Senki)<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Japanese ancap businessman gets offered by God to save his life, but refuses because he&#039;s an edgy fedora<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;God reincarnates him as a blonde loli mage in an alternate-reality Imperial Germany<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;magic exists in this reality, but can only be used by certain people (mages)<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;he (she, Tanya) has magic powers that get stronger when she prays to God, more so than an average mage<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;he still has the memories and mental development of his previous life<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;armies of the time have &quot;mage corps&quot; that use magic to make explosive bullets and force fields, also they can fly<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Tanya joins the military and becomes a ruthless officer loli in charge of Germany&#039;s elite mage corps<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;proceeds to kick French\/gypsie\/commie ass all over Europe<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;show is full of nationalist and right-wing themes<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;one episode is literally called &quot;Deus lo Vult&quot;<\/span>","filename":"Tanya smug mug comfy","ext":".png","w":1675,"h":942,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":140,"tim":1493260690615,"time":1493260690,"md5":"Xdjl1VTz7Uqos\/wkbO7C1g==","fsize":1722896,"resto":0,"id":"Q9Wgyr2b","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"what-are-some-redpilled-animu-pol","country_name":"United States","replies":139,"images":47,"omitted_posts":134,"omitted_images":45,"tail_size":50},{"no":122992443,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)00:06:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"Yuru Yuri is red pilled","filename":"1487751111857","ext":".png","w":642,"h":657,"tn_w":122,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493265991385,"time":1493265991,"md5":"7C+pG4nJ9eBg7UhXapC3vQ==","fsize":616153,"resto":122982076,"id":"BklT8wcI","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122992517,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)00:07:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122991991\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122991991<\/a><br>You&#039;re sorely misguided, my child.

I am a 19 yo Canadian male and Kemalist. I believe that we are randomly born to a country, but people like me are spiritually connected to a country other than the ones we&#039;re born in. I loved the Turkish nation ever since I first learned about the Ottoman Empire and the Seljuk Turks.<br><br>There is Russian blood in my family, and I believe that I am of the same Altaic stock as the Turkish people. I have what the Turkish people would call &#039;Ruh&#039;; the spirit of a Turk. I like Oriental [near eastern] music, food, culture and although I&#039;m an Atheist [like the great Ataturk], I consider myself a cultural Muslim.<br><br>I&#039;ve taught myself Turkish and a little bit of Persian and Arabic. I&#039;ve applied to go to the prestigious Istanbul University where I will become a Poet and Turkicist. If I were born in an earlier age, I would have been a great Turkish bard, with my baglama I would sing tales of the steppe, of the great Khans, and Padishahs that brought us to Anatolia and hymns to Tengri the great lord of the sky, but alas, I am of the era of the Republics.<br><br>I mostly play Mount &amp; Blade: With Fire and Sword as the Crimean Khanate, and I love playing the Ottoman Empire in EU:IV. I&#039;m a long time 4channer, and I just wanted to say to everyone there are Turkophiles on this board, despite the endless memes. Shit like &#039;Remove Kebab&#039; really aren&#039;t funny. There&#039;s a reason the Turks had one of the largest, greatest and most illustrious Empires in history. You should have the same respect for them as most people do the Romans.<br><br>I just want to close by saying that Turkey shouldn&#039;t focus on Europe, but its Altaic brothers to the east. The Turkish people should reunite under a single banner, together they would be a greater force than Russia or Europe. Division makes the Turks weak, unity would make them strong.","filename":"fez","ext":".jpg","w":4320,"h":3240,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1493265103557,"time":1493265103,"md5":"DmK\/4X2E\/\/BTY2yTDSSSLA==","fsize":1117908,"resto":0,"id":"U3Qowbs9","country":"AU","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"merhaba-thats-hello-in-turkish-int-i-am-a-19-yo","country_name":"Australia","replies":6,"images":0,"omitted_posts":1,"omitted_images":0},{"no":122991415,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)23:56:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122990827\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122990827<\/a><br>roaches gonna roach","time":1493265410,"resto":122990827,"id":"GsLN\/hn7","country":"MX","country_name":"Mexico"},{"no":122991699,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)23:59:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122990827\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122990827<\/a><br><br>Blah blah blah.

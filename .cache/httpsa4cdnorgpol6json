They can&#039;t deny service or turn you away, for inability to pay. This legislation has existed for DECADES, well before Obamacare. In fact, it&#039;s WHY hospitals services costs\/charges, have become so fucking high. Before Obama mandated everyone to healthcare coverage and find those without, hospitals\/specialists\/drug manufacturers recovered their revenue losses for services provided to those they treated, who couldn&#039;t pay, by charging those who could, WAY MORE. Ironically, after Obamacare, service costs increased, less are now covered and insurance premiums are higher than they&#039;ve EVER been, in our history. Here&#039;s a tip: the government doesn&#039;t give a fuck about you, your sick kids, your health or wellbeing. They don&#039;t give one single fuck if you&#039;re covered, dying of cancer, fat as fuck or eating tofu burgers, washed down with tree bark smoothies after your yoga class. THE GOVERNMENT ONLY CARES ABOUT CONTROLLING YOUR MONEY AND YOUR POWER OF CHOICE, AS A FUCKING CONSUMER. We are profit to them, not people. &quot;Healthcare&quot; is just ONE of FUCKING THOUSANDS of different excuses THEY USE, to increase our dependency on the &quot;systems&quot; THEY CONTROL, EXPLOIT AND USE, to THEIR advantage, so they can line their OWN pockets, by having an excuse to justify their HUGE, bullshit budgets and spending on lobbied vendor contracts, medical\/drug companies and manufacturers, etc. <br>IF OBAMACARE WAS SO FUCKING GREAT, WHY DID THE ENTIRE GOVERNMENT RECUSE THEMSELVES FROM THE ACA?! WHY AREN&#039;T ANY OF THEM, LEGALLY MANDATED TO HAVE COVERAGE AND ABIDE BY OBAMACARE&#039;S PROVISIONS?!! <br><br>See, the more THEY CAN CONTROL, the more they&#039;ll tax YOU to &quot;operate it&quot;. The more you&#039;re taxed, the less YOU take home. The less you have to spend and save as YOU CHOOSE. The less choice you have, THE LESS &quot;FREE&quot; WE ARE, as citizens. The end.","filename":"image","ext":".jpg","w":900,"h":900,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493837645724,"time":1493837645,"md5":"7DktWmliGas4581gXjQ2nA==","fsize":127129,"resto":123930875,"id":"mIEqDXHr","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123945996,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)14:56:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123930875\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123930875<\/a><br>Abortion is murder.

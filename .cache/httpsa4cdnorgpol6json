But even Elon Musk can be wrong. And he is very wrong on Donald Trump. Elon Musk has become one of Trump\u2019s most prominent supporters, despite the fact that Trump\u2019s policies directly contradict Musk\u2019s core values, core values shared by Tesla customers and employees. Help us convince Elon to do the right thing. Help us convince him to resign from Donald Trump\u2019s business councils. Help us convince him to take the Hat Tweet Challenge and become a leader of the opposition to Donald Trump\u2019s climate change policies. If he does we\u2019ll donate $1 million to charity.<\/span>","filename":"1024-amber-heard-elon-musk-mega31156-11","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":1495,"tn_w":171,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492996306892,"time":1492996306,"md5":"Q78eBKV9FmhpZkVxf1arzg==","fsize":443394,"resto":0,"id":"cFCArch0","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"elon-musk-is-a-visionary-entrepreneur-and","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":122508160,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)19:33:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"Is it terrible that even though I have 100% different beliefs than her, Laci is still my waifu :(","filename":"lacigreen-feature","ext":".jpg","w":480,"h":330,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":171,"tim":1492990416374,"time":1492990416,"md5":"JVia3fzA2ohVneimqtn\/5A==","fsize":27793,"resto":0,"id":"EjgtJ+mp","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"is-it-terrible-that-even-though-i-have-100","country_name":"Canada","replies":53,"images":12,"omitted_posts":48,"omitted_images":11},{"no":122518651,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)20:58:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122514198\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122514198<\/a><br><br>The one sloot I&#039;d hate fuck any day","time":1492995490,"resto":122508160,"id":"tIaQZxgr","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122519029,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)21:01:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122518114\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122518114<\/a><br>absolutely based","time":1492995702,"resto":122508160,"id":"WCZWx3mX","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122519877,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)21:09:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122518114\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122518114<\/a><br>This is actually true.

But let&#039;s say brand confidence isn&#039;t an issue; you still have to deal with finding the correctly skilled workers, which involves presumably an interview process, and then transporting them to your town, training them and then getting them to a skill level comparable to your old workers.

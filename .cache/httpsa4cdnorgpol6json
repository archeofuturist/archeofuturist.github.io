It&#039;s especially apparent in his debates, which with his incisive grasp of the language, is able to decimate virtually every argument thrown at him. <br><br>It&#039;s one thing to know the meaning of a word, or understand it&#039;s usage in a particular context, but is another thing to be able to easily employ such word when you are speaking. There are of course people who when they come across a seemingly uncommon word, understand it&#039;s meaning, but don&#039;t use such word when they speak. In my 21 years listening to people speak English, I haven&#039;t seen anyone with a richer vocabulary than Sam. And this is just my observation, perhaps it is flawed, and anyone who thinks differently is free to repudiate my claim.<br><br>And Sam isn&#039;t verbose in his speaking. He doesn&#039;t obfuscate his speech by using &quot;big words&quot; just to sound smart. He uses &quot;big words&quot; because they are the best words to use in such context, that would properly emphasize his point. And i don&#039;t think he perceives these words as big words, and I also don&#039;t think there is anything like big words. What we categorize as big words, are just uncommon words.<br><br>Now my question is, how did Sam become so articulate? How did he develop the ability to speak so fluently and coherently with such amazing command of the English language? Has he commented on this? Was it through reading? Was it through meditating?

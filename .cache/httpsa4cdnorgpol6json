I have been back several times. <br><br>My grandmother and father migrated to Sweden from Transylvania as refugees because they were Hungarians living under the oppression of the communist dictatorship of Ceausescu. <br><br>For over 20 years now, my grandmother has been trying to get a job, working for government benefits in voluntary positions to increase her chances. She&#039;s finally landed a job last year working in a mental hospital in the middle of absolutely nowhere. Her wages are terrible, her job security non existent and her hours even worse.<br><br>In this small forest town, there are 3 old apartment complexes, all of them now full of Syrian refugees. However, these complexes are isolated with a single road, with 20KM to the nearest shop or to the town center. There is 1 bus per day into town, but none to get back. <br><br>What the fuck is going on in Sweden? My grandmother is extremely hard working, has perfect Swedish, is an amazing cook and obsessive cleaner, and has just landed her first job after 20 years of voluntary work. How the fuck does the government expect it can give opportunities to these Syrians? <br><br>The worst part is, because of the isolation, most of them have nothing to do, and never meet Swedish people. They are stuck in these complexes, speaking Arabic and never having to assimilate. It is even hard for them to get into town and back to feed their families.<br><br>This isolation is going to breed extremism on a scale that we haven&#039;t seen before. Although this generation might be thankful to be safe and away from US and Russian airstrikes, the next generation will not understand it in the same way. <br><br>Enough with the sand-niggers stealing blonde girls and the cucked Swedish meme, majority of refugees don&#039;t make it to see Swedish people.","filename":"Malilla","ext":".jpg","w":275,"h":183,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1490742598087,"time":1490742598,"md5":"t+MFRl+owrGv7PdEPVOHSA==","fsize":12817,"resto":0,"id":"kAul26YR","country":"AU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"nonmeme-sweden-thread","country_name":"Australia","replies":14,"images":3,"omitted_posts":9,"omitted_images":1},{"no":118715478,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)19:39:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118711931\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118711931<\/a><br>sween is going to go full hitler before any other yuro country","time":1490744353,"resto":118711931,"id":"3lwRNOiO","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118715518,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)19:39:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118715144\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118715144<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;nigger<\/span><br>What&#039;s a nigger?","time":1490744375,"resto":118711931,"id":"ayFwV1vE","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":118715784,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)19:41:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118713328\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118713328<\/a><br>why?","time":1490744471,"resto":118711931,"id":"QWzwo8jx","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":118715933,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)19:42:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118713631\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118713631<\/a><br>thanks, even with her limited English, I think I could get her a decent job within a few weeks of moving to Australia.

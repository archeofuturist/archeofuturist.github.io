Of course you&#039;re oppressed. You are oppressed because you aren&#039;t smart enough to not be oppressed. Anyone who would be a slave should be a slave Sambo.

She didn&#039;t want to get bitten and she didn&#039;t want White Massa to beat her shiny black bluegum havin&#039; ass for letting that precious little white baby she was babysitting get bit.

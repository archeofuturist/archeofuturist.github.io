I really do. Living in a city makes me hate not only the non-whites but also the white people that I see and meet. <br><br>For this reason I say that public transport should be provided but it should be dated, inadequate very cheap but at the same time over priced for what you get and only provided to those who sign up for some kind of subscription service which is forced onto the public by constant mail drops and telemarketers. There should be many many unused stops on the transport lines and unnecessary detours. Security should be severely lacking and the transport lines should become havens for drug dealers, petty thugs and the homeless. Being for the public and the public being shit, the public should be forced to suffer in whatever ways possible. Maintenance and updates should be kept to a minimum so there can be as many breakdowns as possible and when maintenance should occur we must ensure it is poorly timed, unannounced, costly and as inconvenient as possible for all who have grown to rely on public transport, we should also do out best to cause obstruction to any surrounding roads while maintenance is being preformed as well. <br><br>We should also strive to take such action against the public in other public spaces such as parks, playground, shopping centers, schools, libraries, and town halls. In the future it would be in our interests to extend this treatment to the homes of the public so we no longer have to wait for them to go outside to force them to suffer and they will no longer have a place to hide and masturbate.

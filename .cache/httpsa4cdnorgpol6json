Why do you think so many leftwing atheist keep attacking Christians here and their belief in God? They try so hard in asking you about so many different questions. I am actually very impressed with the answers given. I figure you guys are young and the answer given is really deep. It truly is impressive, I figure the youth would not be that informed. <br><br>I always find it weird that these left wing atheist come here of all places and try to attack the Christian right.

I just wanted to make this thread to make amends. Ive been coming here and trolling you guys for some time and Ive said some questionable things. Things I can never take back. It was wrong of me. I just wanted to give you a taste of your own medicine or so I thought. But the truth is people are just people. And if I walked in your shoes, in the same environments, exposed to the same friends, maybe I too would be like you. <br><br>It was my intention to humiliate you and make you see how it felt to be considered low. It was fun, the bantz. But I paid too steep of a price. &quot;There is another side which we must never overlook. Hate is just as injurious to the person who hates. Like an unchecked cancer, hate corrodes the personality and eats away its vital unity. Hate destroys a man&#039;s sense of values and his objectivity. It causes him to describe the beautiful as ugly and the ugly as beautiful, and to confuse the true with the false and the false with the true.&quot; <br><br>Im going to try to be better to my white brothers and further understand your situation. <br><br>&quot;We must not seek to use our emerging freedom and our growing power to do the same thing to the white minority that has been done to us for so many centuries. Our aim must never be to defeat or humiliate the white man. We must not become victimized with a philosophy of black supremacy. God is not interested merely in freeing black men and brown men and yellow men, but God is interested in freeing the whole human race. We must work with determination to create a society, not where black men are superior and other men are inferior and vice versa, but a society in which all men will live together as brothers and respect the dignity and worth of human personality.&quot; - MLK<br><br>Do you forgive me pol? =|","filename":"Indian albinos with Drumf","ext":".jpg","w":484,"h":727,"tn_w":166,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492861787363,"time":1492861787,"md5":"\/lWxkb\/fpbIG\/TJ99xFujA==","fsize":111306,"resto":0,"id":"wINLCsdj","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"a-l-b-i-n-o-p-o-s-t-e-r-a-m-a-r-u-c-c-c-a-a-a","country_name":"United States","replies":3,"images":2},{"no":122269811,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)08:03:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122268753\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122268753<\/a><br>LLBA - long live the black albino.","filename":"1490926284968","ext":".jpg","w":645,"h":860,"tn_w":93,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492862617687,"time":1492862617,"md5":"7PjobDsIHY2ehutDABC1+g==","fsize":71378,"resto":122268753,"id":"ewW5v6iz","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122269974,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)08:05:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122269811\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122269811<\/a><br>Man I wish we got some other skin tones.

The fact that they hide behind buildings and paper forms rather than come up to your door and just demand your money then and there?<br><br>I think paycheck deductions are a big part of how they&#039;re able to get away with it. When your money is gone before you even get it, it doesn&#039;t feel so much like theft. But if you ever become self-employed you&#039;ll be responsible for sending your own taxes to the government, and then the reality of &#039;taxation is theft&#039; will become more apparent.<br><br>What is there to be done about this?<br><br>The government controls the military, so armed insurrection appears difficult.<br><br>Perhaps we can start a TGTOW movement; taxpayers going their own way, where we move to countries away from these countries that are charging us taxes. This will prove challenging though because most foreign countries charge taxes as well, and many countries that don&#039;t charge taxes, like Saudi Arabia, are unpleasant for other reasons.<br><br>So what are your thoughts on taxation? Is it theft? If so, how do you cope with having your money stolen?

It is not and you need to KYS if you think it does.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;b-but Alcohol and Tobacco are more harmful that Marijuana<\/span><br><br>Except the difference here is that Alcohol and Tobacco are legal and are widely distributed than Marijuana. More so, there NO serious scientific\/medical evidence that Marijuana is indeed good or harmless. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Medical Marijuana. Bam. Owned. QED MUDDAFUGGA<\/span><br><br>Except here is that Marijuana is not regulated by the FDA and the dosage of Marijuana varies. No drug that is approved by the FDA is smoked. Arizona&#039;s distribution of medical Marijuana indicates that only 3.76 percent of card holders use Marijuana to ease the symptoms of cancer. Another 1.53 percent suffer from glaucoma while a 1.06 percent have AIDS while in states like Colorado and and California, over 90 percent use it for &quot;severe pain&quot;.

The 2012 National survey on Drug Use and Health estimates that 2.7 million people 12 years of age and older meet the DSM-IV criteria for dependence on Marijuana. More so, an adolescent brain is much more suspectable to addiction than an adult. This has received support from studies where animals have shown that parental exposure to THC can recalibrate the sensitivity of the reward system to other drugs. That same exposure affects interferes with cytoskeletal dynamics which are critical for the establishment of axonal connections between neurons.","filename":"SayNoToWeed","ext":".jpg","w":484,"h":502,"tn_w":241,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493694317866,"time":1493694317,"md5":"AIhG4rnqwAz5w9CRL2puww==","fsize":60291,"resto":0,"id":"ypSMYy9H","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"you-are-a-degenerate-if-you-smoke-marijuana","country_name":"United States","replies":164,"images":31,"omitted_posts":159,"omitted_images":30,"tail_size":50},{"no":123728847,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)00:53:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123728749\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123728749<\/a><br>99% of the people defending weed are potheads (mental lightweights) so these debate are always easy peasy<br><br>Like I said earlier in this thread I wouldn&#039;t even give a fuck about these losers if they&#039;d just admit to themselves that what they&#039;re doing isn&#039;t good and shouldn&#039;t be encouraged","time":1493700792,"resto":123717036,"id":"x\/1vnN1+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123728967,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)00:54:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123728260\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123728260<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;everybody who smokes weed is a loser<\/span><br>You are dominated by emotion.

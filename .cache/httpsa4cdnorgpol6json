They don&#039;t care about men or themselves. They need the slaves on the plantations and the only way they know how to keep them there is through shaming. Works pretty well(look at tradcucks on this board) but its beginning to fail. You know what would actually kill mgtow? incentivizing men to get married. But to the tradcuck, perfect female specimen&#039;s can do no wrong, they have no fault in the matter. Neither does the government that backs the irrational females thoughts with the full power of the state. MAN up pussy!

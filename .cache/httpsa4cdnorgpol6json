When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw them trying to walk out the door with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying.<br>The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like \u201cSir, you need to pay for those first.\u201d At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter. Ivanka looked all put out. <br> <br>When the cashier took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually \u201cto prevent any electrical infetterence,\u201d and then turned around and winked at me. I don\u2019t even think that\u2019s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly.<br> <br>Needless to say, I was shocked.

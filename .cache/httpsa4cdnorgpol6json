Christianity is a semitic religion for semitic people, it is obsessed with suffering and sacrifice because desert living is cruel and difficult.

Choose between us and those sons of Sodom, have yourselves sexually serviced on the mound of corpses of your husbands who fell in battle -- as so many of your mothers&#039; mothers did! Take them to your husbands&#039; houses, so they can make harem slaves of you, so you can become the mother of a brood of lascivious, bloodthirsty beasts, who know no motherly or wifely love!

Liebenfels continues:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;As highly as we honor the wife in the family and in the home, we must just as intensely fight against the intrusion of women into public life, because the ultimate outcome of these efforts would be, and to some extent is already, unilateral women&#039;s rights, which would make the world into a big brothel in which everything revolves around penises and pussies in a silly and absurd satyrs&#039; orgy while the proper wife, the loyal mother of the house, and the healthy strong troop of children will be mercilessly driven out of the chaste and legitimate home.

The problem with democracy is that people can vote entitlements on to themselves without actually doing anything worthwhile, essentially becoming leeches on the system. These people will vote for the same &quot;entitlements&quot; every year siphoning more and more money from the taxpayer attracting more and more people to the welfare nanny state. <br><br>With starship troopers however, to get the right to vote, you must contribute to society first. Starship troopers isn&#039;t perfect, because it uses citizenship as a recruiting tactic (much like the US uses honor, glory, and games like call of duty to recruit young idiots) and it doesn&#039;t portray &quot;wars for isreal&quot; like what&#039;s happening today. But it allieviates the problem with democracy, because citizens can at least say they contributed to humanity before going to the ballot box. This would bolster recruiting and remove the retarded quotas that we have in place to meet at the expense of poor classes. It would also eliminate the &quot;leeches&quot; from society, because the military instills discipline and honor in people, setting them up for society later on by being less lazy and more productive. The leeches would either be converted or never have the right to vote.

The group has maliciously harmed Trump supporters before and have burnt signs that say &quot;Free Speech&quot; on them. Thankfully, the people of Berkeley and the Bay Area stuck up for their rights and pushed back the irresponsible teenagers trying to desperately sabotage the rally. Interestingly, I saw about 1-2 people with Kekistan flags at the battle. Usually, traditionalist conservatives and Alt-Right Kekistanies don&#039;t tend to work together or at least cooperate side by side during certain events. The ideal conservatives tend to donate lots of money to campaigns and live the &quot;American dream.&quot;, however the trolls of \/pol\/ crack down the location of a flag put up by Shia Le-fucking-beof. I feel as if both sides combine, they can transform into a giant powerhouse that can change the political system for at least a century. The one guy with the Kekistan flag wasn&#039;t the only alt-right member there. <br><br><br>The win for the right at Berkeley shows how politics aren&#039;t a joke. The election of Donald Trump isn&#039;t one big meme 4chan. Its serious business. You can laugh at the current divided political stand point of America, but its not good for the country, hell, any country. Just look at Sweden. All I&#039;m trying to say is to try to stop fucking with land whales on tumblr who don&#039;t do anything all day, and try to stop the communist that are infecting tons of country&#039;s. These people don&#039;t belong the the Us, Canada, UK, or any other nation. These people are in college, getting scholarships, and will get high class jobs one day. Yet, these people want to rule the world and take away peoples right to be themselves all for the sake of &quot;being nice&quot;. So please pol, try to help save the world.

Clear-thinking anti-Zionists correctly identified WNs long ago as useful idiots led by Zionist agents to forment interethnic tension. As Aryanists, we moreover emphasize how WNs themselves have proven no different from present-day Israelis in their way of thinking (which many WNs themselves even admit). Either way, they have no place within any serious anti-Zionist movement, but should be considered part of the enemy in the broader anti-tribalist movement that we have proposed, for by their ethnocentrism they have already rejected our motto of UNITY THROUGH NOBILITY.<br><br>(* Obviously WNs are not \u2013 despite the name they give themselves \u2013 nationalistic in any serious sense, as their allegiance is not to any country but rather to the international \u201cwhite\u201d diaspora, much like how Jews\u2019 allegiance is to the international Jewish diaspora. The quickest way to disprove WN claims to nationalism is to ask them whether or not they would prioritize a \u201cnon-white\u201d person from their own country over a \u201cwhite\u201d person from another country. What WNs mean by their crude abuse of the term is that they want countries where only \u201cwhite\u201d people are allowed to live, just as Jews have Israel.)","filename":"1491086701070","ext":".jpg","w":960,"h":960,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492561206914,"time":1492561206,"md5":"sLJ8lnNB4QRidMOFBIB+Rw==","fsize":308099,"resto":0,"id":"DsUyfoEB","country":"LT","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"an-anon-posted-this-in-another-thread-and-it-was","country_name":"Lithuania","replies":38,"images":3,"omitted_posts":33,"omitted_images":3},{"no":121773386,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)20:54:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121768166\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121768166<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;White nationalists don&#039;t hate jews the right way and I dun lyke it<\/span><br><br>There is nothing wrong with Zionism or any other ethnic nationalism including white nationalism.","time":1492563244,"resto":121768166,"id":"+TFlxTNI","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121773418,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)20:54:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121769214\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121769214<\/a><br>if thats the tl;dr then kys OP","filename":"1490990112082s","ext":".jpg","w":250,"h":245,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":122,"tim":1492563257419,"time":1492563257,"md5":"MbFGDYZRNN95HZI2zGt7BA==","fsize":5432,"resto":121768166,"id":"+bTWeTse","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":121773469,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)20:54:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121773008\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121773008<\/a><br>i&#039;m okay alliing with jews, honestly. anyone who things jews are worse than mudslimes, idk what to tell you.","time":1492563275,"resto":121768166,"id":"rWnA8eRI","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121773633,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)20:55:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121773469\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121773469<\/a><br>allying","time":1492563340,"resto":121768166,"id":"rWnA8eRI","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121773741,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)20:56:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"Mainly I had a problem with this part<br><a href=\"#p121768553\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121768553<\/a>","time":1492563392,"resto":121768166,"id":"DsUyfoEB","country":"LT","country_name":"Lithuania"}]},{"posts":[{"no":121771639,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)20:42:19","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Human Sexuality - Roman Catholic Sexologist","com":"I&#039;m a &quot;Roman Catholic Sexologist&quot; (bet you don&#039;t hear that all the time).<br><br>I&#039;m not inerrant on the subject (as no one is), and I do not represent the Catholic Church.

anime for beginners. some of them (lists that is, not just shows) will be trash, but hopefully you find a decent one<br><br>to start off with, shows like bebop, evangelion, gurren lagann, ghost in the shell, baccano, lupin the third, black lagoon and what not are good starting points, so if a list or chart has those it&#039;s likely not too shitty<br><br>from then you&#039;ll get a feel for things you like and dislike. you might notice that a lot of the shows you like the most were made by a single studio within the span of a couple years. if you dig further you might see they share the same director, or a main animator or something similar. <br><br>maybe you&#039;ll notice you like the more action oriented shows where the main characters face off against an existential threat each episode, or you enjoy comfy slice of life shows where nothing crazy happens, or you just can&#039;t get enough of romance stories, or you love romance stories but you can&#039;t stand contrived love triangles, or you just can&#039;t get enough of fuckhuge mechs fighting huge battles<br><br>also it&#039;s pretty easy to get into shows that are currently airing. just take a look at a list of currently airing shows (https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/seas<wbr>on) and take note of anything that has interesting art or an interesting description. shows almost always have 1.30 minute long promotional videos (pv) on places like youtube which will help you further decide if you think a show is worth watching. not trying to push watching currently airing shows or anything (since this season doesn&#039;t seem amazing desu), but people do often think it&#039;s more impenetrable than it

Peripherally the average antifa activist is a useful idiot. But its core is being steered by rogue elements of intelligence communities (or as you might say, &quot;deep state.&quot;) This guidance occurs within their thought leadership structures, literature and websites, and trickles out. <br><br>2. Essentially, antifa is being enticed into more violent guerrilla techniques. You&#039;ll start to see random bombing and terror campaigns in densely populated cities (think back to the Weather Underground, but far more destructive).<br><br>3. They are being aligned with well armed and trained insurgents, many of whom are refugees and members of Islamic State. <br><br>4. Expect to see them escalate quite soon as we approach the warmer Summer climate in the US. You will see less black blocs at rallies, and more decentralization and unpredictable violence. <br><br>5. 90% of antifa is comprised of unsuspecting young males. Many have mental disorders, are into heavy drug use, do not have fathers, have health problems\/STDs, are into prostitution and pornography to raise funds (&quot;sex work&quot;). They are prone to manipulation and have nothing to lose. <br><br>6. It&#039;s the core 10% that is guiding and managing. Trained insurgents entering as refugees, but more often rogue elements of CIA, trafficking cartels and university professors on CIA payroll. Politicians whose names you&#039;d recognize have a stake as well. This 10% helps produce much of the messaging and organizing for the 90% to do the dirty work. <br><br>In the following short, skip to 15:15, where you can see them organizing with refugees and aligning with radical American insurgents in Syria (read: &quot;deep state&quot;): https:\/\/sub.media\/video\/trouble-2-b<wbr>ash-the-fash\/ (This short, incidentally, is CIA&#039;s latest guiding hand. Attentive viewers will observe their fingerprints all over.)<br><br>Bottom line: keep your eyes open and prepare accordingly both online and off. None of this is fate and they can fail.","filename":"antifa aligned with isis-cia","ext":".jpg","w":1200,"h":674,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1493825481052,"time":1493825481,"md5":"NkKu8J7XrKQeC\/u9BZiZTw==","fsize":158975,"resto":0,"id":"8Wt8fH1f","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"antifa-acquiring-explosives-and-rpgs-aligning","country_name":"United States","replies":174,"images":46,"omitted_posts":169,"omitted_images":45,"tail_size":50},{"no":123956161,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)16:13:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123923534\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123923534<\/a><br>First of all: sage this filth.<br>Second of all: If you think feds haven&#039;t infiltrated antifa like they have infiltrated the kkk you are kidding yourself.","time":1493842397,"resto":123923534,"id":"GBJNLBXB","country":"AR","country_name":"Argentina"},{"no":123956598,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)16:15:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123930988\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123930988<\/a><br><a href=\"#p123931034\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123931034<\/a><br><a href=\"#p123931118\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123931118<\/a><br>gtfo, lying shill cunt","time":1493842527,"resto":123923534,"id":"Xc\/Ig57i","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":123957628,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)16:22:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123923534\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123923534<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;We Antifa are defenders of freedom, stop calling us terroris-<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Haha, I mean.. uhm.. y-yeah.

It&#039;s those, sometimes annoying, rules that keep the game coherent and recognisable as Monopoly.

And if we allow them to do it they will craft rules in their benefit while telling every other player it&#039;s for their benefit too, but truth is they have their hand in the bank while you&#039;re looking the other way.

They laugh at you and mock you, they tell all their friends about how much of a sore loser you are. Then when you get angry, when you can longer take the self-righteous actions of the the other players and you lash out, they call the police on you and have you taken away.","filename":"1489335133461","ext":".jpg","w":1336,"h":744,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":69,"tim":1493842102677,"time":1493842102,"md5":"qnNNUtxSlJtvnviWICFpAQ==","fsize":364162,"resto":123947348,"id":"pTGWjMHd","country":"GB","m_img":1,"country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123956395,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)16:13:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123954956\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123954956<\/a><br>Additionally...","filename":"1493350675552","ext":".png","w":952,"h":1103,"tn_w":107,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493842438747,"time":1493842438,"md5":"+YJzEx1RVbcAwuoD\/xPRJA==","fsize":832147,"resto":123947348,"id":"6kko3JCL","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":123956698,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)16:15:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123947348\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123947348<\/a><br>You have the wrong, individualistic mindset.

And that&#039;s an animal. You have instincts that are all geared to procreation and your instincts will bug you the least if you reproduce successfully. People who get lost in hedonism overdo their dopamine so they&#039;re fucked up and miserable in the longterm.<br>Now, you want to procreate but you also want the kids to be successful. Now you get into stats to see what you should do in order to achieve that. Having a traditional wife who didn&#039;t sleep around is a good start. Making sure she&#039;s of the same ethnicity as you (I&#039;m not talking race, ethnicity means if you&#039;re German you stick it into a German qt, not a Russian or a Spaniard chick) so you don&#039;t get outbreeding depression (look it up). Also, while you&#039;ll get the best chances at a successful marriage if you shack it up with a sheboon, the kid will be half black and therefor idiotic and what&#039;s the point of having one? Also, you&#039;ll find out that personality traits are more genetically inherited than they are learned so you want a woman who&#039;s a nice person, intelligent and successful cause that&#039;s what you want your kids to be.<br>Now you might think, my instincts also want me to have grandkids one day, so you want to make sure your kids reproduce successfully.<br><br>At this point you&#039;ll be anti faggotry, anti feminist and racist cause you don&#039;t want your kids to have the homosex, empowered womynism or black dick shoved into them. You might look into how society used to be geared to enable as many people as possible to reproduce successfully but it isn&#039;t anymore and why is that? At this point you&#039;ll also become an antisemite.<br>After that you look into economy and government styles and you conclude that the closest to perfection, even if you base it on pure results alone and do no thinking on why, how or is it fair or not, was Germany in the 30s.<br><br>tl;dr you&#039;ll be happiest if you&#039;re a legit nazi","time":1491287915,"resto":119429910,"id":"xugdgvui","country":"HR","country_name":"Croatia"}]},{"posts":[{"no":119426922,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)23:50:40","name":"Anonymous","sub":"LOCK HIM UP!!!

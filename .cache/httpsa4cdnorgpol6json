Symptoms are all mental health based: depression, anxiety, unease with their bodies, suicidal thoughts. The suicide rate of GID\/GIS\/GD sufferers is 41% compared to under 2% of the normal population. Both the psychiatric and medical fields recognize GID\/GIS\/GD as a mental health issue.<br><br>Current standard treatment for the patient consists of psychiatric therapy and later prescription medication with synthetic hormones. Psychiatric therapy is the foundation of their treatment, and no doctor or psychiatrist proceeds with synthetic hormones without concurrent psychiatric therapy. The current treatment is recognized by both psychiatrists and medical doctors as moderately effective in reducing their rate of suicide, depression, anxiety, dysphoria, and other accompanying mental health symptoms of GID\/GIS\/GD to varying degrees of success. Sexual reassignment surgery is effective in relieving these mental health symptoms short term but fails to provide relief long term.<br><br>People with GID\/GIS\/GD have a much higher prevalence of Body Dysmorphic Disorder and Body Integrity Disorder, noting that in both, the sufferers have a pervasive delusional view of their own bodies that cripples their normal functioning.

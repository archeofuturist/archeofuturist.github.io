The suit was filed on Sunday in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California by celebrity trial lawyer Mark Geragos, who is seeking class action status. Geragos filed suit electronically on Sunday on behalf of plaintiff Daniel Jung, who is seeking $5 million in damages for alleged fraud, breach of contract, breach of covenant of good faith and negligent misrepresentation.<br><br>The suit anticipates a class of \u201cmore than 150 \u201cplaintiffs for whom it seeks a minimum of $100 million. Geragos will be busy over the upcoming week seeking out other litigants to join the suit, which alleges that the \u201cfestival\u2019s lack of adequate food, water, shelter, and medical care created a dangerous and panicked situation among attendees \u2014 suddenly finding themselves stranded on a remote island without basic provisions \u2014 that was closer to \u2018The Hunger Games\u2019 or \u2018Lord of the Flies\u2019 than Coachella.\u201d<br><br>The suit claims as its causes of action: fraud, breach of contract, breach of covenant of good faith and negligent misrepresentation and seeks a minimum of $100 million in damages. It is believed a crowd of approximately 6,000 attendees was expected to attend the festival, though it is unclear how many tickets were actually sold.","filename":"MarkGeragos","ext":".jpg","w":1500,"h":1000,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1493645533220,"time":1493645533,"md5":"iVN08EYdP8EThZJjLb\/gKQ==","fsize":200502,"resto":0,"id":"WtzMdjiT","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"100-million-dollar-lawsuit-filed-over-fyre","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":0},{"no":123621315,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)09:36:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123620921\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123620921<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Billy McFarland<\/span><br>This guy has an impressive list of failures.<br><br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Billy<wbr>_McFarland_(entrepreneur)<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;College drop out<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Founded failed online marketing company<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Founded failed VIP club aimed at other vacuous dipshits like him<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Came up with Fyre Festival<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Can&#039;t even spell &#039;fire&#039;<\/span><br><br>And he&#039;s only 25!

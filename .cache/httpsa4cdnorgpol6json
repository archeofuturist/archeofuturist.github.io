Niggers are carrying guns in your country, giving a nigger a gun is like giving a baby abo some weed. Why do you even need guns? bows and arrows are more effective at killing anyway. Guns are loud, bows are almost completely silent but it depends how much force you apply to the string. Actually, boomerangs are the most efficient, effective ranged weapon known to mankind. If you&#039;re skilled with a boomerang you practically have infinite ammo, also, boomerangs rarely kill unless you apply a lot of force into the throw and it hits your targets head.

His words were posted online by respected political pundit Caroline Orr:<br><br>This may explain why Michael Flynn is offering to cut a deal.

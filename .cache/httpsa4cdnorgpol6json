And it should not cause those who profess to be followers of the Christ to be prejudiced against the Jew as a fellow mortal. The Jews, as a nation, as a sociopolitical group, paid in full the terrible price of rejecting the Prince of Peace. Long since they ceased to be the spiritual torchbearers of divine truth to the races of mankind, but this constitutes no valid reason why the individual descendants of these long-ago Jews should be made to suffer the persecutions which have been visited upon them by intolerant, unworthy, and bigoted professed followers of Jesus of Nazareth, who was, himself, a Jew by natural birth.<br>175:2.2.Many times has this unreasoning and un-Christlike hatred and persecution of modern Jews terminated in the suffering and death of some innocent and unoffending Jewish individual whose very ancestors, in the times of Jesus, heartily accepted his gospel and presently died unflinchingly for that truth which they so wholeheartedly believed. What a shudder of horror passes over the onlooking celestial beings as they behold the professed followers of Jesus indulge themselves in persecuting, harassing, and even murdering the later-day descendants of Peter, Philip, Matthew, and others of the Palestinian Jews who so gloriously yielded up their lives as the first martyrs of the gospel of the heavenly kingdom!","time":1492237820,"resto":121173899,"id":"A\/QX690z","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121180411,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)02:30:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121179934\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121179934<\/a><br><br>Go away Kike (((())))<br><br>Just wait until all the hatred is focused on you once again","filename":"1000509261001_1630293503001_BIO-Biography-Adolf-Hitler-SF","ext":".jpg","w":768,"h":432,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1492237843017,"time":1492237843,"md5":"ERvCOKskj6IRQCmHBtGYwg==","fsize":90948,"resto":121173899,"id":"F3w1wNZu","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121181003,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)02:37:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"Focus on the Jew.","filename":"download (1)","ext":".jpg","w":191,"h":264,"tn_w":90,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492238273374,"time":1492238273,"md5":"XDOC3B9izIrV4BeHJy1USQ==","fsize":12852,"resto":121173899,"id":"F3w1wNZu","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121181089,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)02:38:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121179934\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121179934<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;30% <\/span><br>yea and I bet Hollywood is 10% Jewish. <br>Also 45% of Jews in the US are in the top 1% of earners.

Also, another mistake that people who argue against &quot;God&quot; (usually) make is that they disregard any other theistic philosophical views that can technically be provable if a person interprets naturalism as God, or a mixture of naturalism and the supernatural. <br><br>This will usually result in the individual responding with quotes similar to the &quot;If God is able to prevent evil...&quot; which is usually directed at organized religion. Just make sure that they are not tying the discussion of theistic ideals to religion. <br><br>You can set the foundation for your argument by discussing what your theistic ideology is, and depending on which you chose, you can elaborate on it and show what proof there is for said thing. Note, people frequently assume &quot;God&quot; has a limit in what God can be\/is, so if you were to say that you believe that naturalism is God, you&#039;ll run into the situation where the other person says &quot;That&#039;s just science, not God.&quot; This&#039;ll show a misunderstanding on their behalf for the various theistic ideals.","time":1490398720,"resto":118136469,"id":"5LjuGr13","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118152624,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)19:45:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118151829\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118151829<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;A Lesson in Obfuscation: the post<\/span>","time":1490399111,"resto":118136469,"id":"eJKZmNK\/","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118152654,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)19:45:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118141730\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118141730<\/a><br>Dont use your heart, use your brain.

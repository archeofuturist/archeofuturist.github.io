The one is Universalist, the other is not. The pagans of Rome did not consider that their gods were the &quot;true and only&quot; gods. In fact they respected foreign gods as much as their own. In this, was their strength, and also their downfall. Whenever the Romans, during some conquest of a foreign land, came across a god they&#039;d never seen before, they wanted to start worshipping it themselves. The Romans were total pragmatists. They considered that any foreign god should be respected, if the worship of that god could bring the Roman people some practical advantage.<br><br>Now, the Christians god is a jealous god. He is the only god. The Christians believe that their god is the one and only god and that all other gods are false. Can you see the impending conflict? When the Romans first came in contact with Christianity, they thought to allow it and to encourage its worship. It was only later when the christians reached a critical mass, that it became too late. When Christians got power in the imperium, they had little mercy with the pagan gods. Thus, a whole traditional belief system was stamped out and removed. Sad, really.<br><br>Pic related. Julian, the last Pagan emperor of Rome, tried to re-instate the pagan beliefs. He wrote a massive critique of christianity and tried to justify the old ways. So what happened? After his death, the christians burnt all his books, looted the temples and banned pagan gods forever.","filename":"julian apostate q","ext":".png","w":4000,"h":4000,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490129316578,"time":1490129316,"md5":"USs2KZEUKLbFaj3bLR5vBw==","fsize":694620,"resto":117659515,"id":"8RYi1Di\/","country":"SE","m_img":1,"country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":117670223,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)17:05:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117659896\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117659896<\/a><br>Muslims started as eastern orthodox Christians who thought all the drunken homosexual pedophilia and the worship of idols and the church were too much.<br><br>No Christians = No Muslim","time":1490130303,"resto":117659515,"id":"x7l7Osb\/","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":117672391,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)17:23:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117663902\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117663902<\/a><br>Muslims did the same thing but better<br><br>Then again as I said here<br><br><a href=\"#p117670223\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117670223<\/a><br><br><br>No christian = no muslim<br><br>As a counter point the lack or religious strife and division may well have prevented the fall of the empire.<br><br><a href=\"#p117667214\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117667214<\/a><br>Bro, its only an inalienable right if your both the right kind of christian.<br><br>Theres a lot of sad history about what happened to the wrong sorts of Christians and the Pagans.

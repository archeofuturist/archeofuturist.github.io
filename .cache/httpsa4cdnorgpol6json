SO YOU WILL ALWAYS BE MAN\/WOMAN.<br><br>That is true, but there&#039;s a difference between being man and being male\/masculine. Same goes for female\/feminine. Allow me to explain by using science. No SJW bullcrap, pure biology. <br><br>Chromosomes can&#039;t change. Everybody knows that. But chromosomes are not everything. If you really work in the field of genetics or neurology you might have heard of the neuron group INAH-3. Depending on it&#039;s size it defines how masculine or feminine you are. INAH-3 is observably larger in men than women. Research of Simon Levay has shown us that when a man has a small INAH-3 they are more likely to be homosexual or mtf transgender. Thesame way around for females who have a bigger INAH-3; they tend to be lesbians or ftm transgender.<br><br>Are Genes the only factor? Apparently not.<br>Is INAH-3 the only sidefactor? Not at all, there are even more genes and neuron groups that define your sexuality and gender identification. <br><br>There are hormone concentrations that vary throughout your body. Some males have high testosterone of themselves, other suffer from a deficiency.

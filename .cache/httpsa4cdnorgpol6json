But you&#039;re not in despair. In fact, despite the circumstances, you&#039;re supremely energised; and in the warm air of the oncoming Prussian summer, you&#039;re beaming with expectant hope. <br><br>Because you&#039;re part of a movement that&#039;s going to reinvigorate your nation. Reshape it, and mould it into something far beyond the imaginations of your progenitors. There&#039;s a man, the future architect and general of this greater Germany, named Adolf Hitler. Upon him rests the hopes of an entire generation, an entire civilisation. You can already tell that he&#039;s a creature built from the same mould as the Alexanders, the Napoleons, and the Caesars of history, and under his banner you walk, hand-in-hand with comrades - the finest men you&#039;ve ever known - who share your innermost convictions, and of whom you&#039;re proud to call yourself a friend.<br><br>Things are moving so fast. The people, the media, and the government are quickly waking up to stupefying fact of your assent. Things previously thought only the private whispers of a few learned men are now sprawling public debates, you can see the scales falling from their eyes. At this pivotal moment, you&#039;re all the more hyped to spring into action, to win this first victory for your people...<br><br>My God son - you&#039;ve won! The beginning of the best hour of Germany has finally come! You&#039;ve never felt more elated, more validated than in this moment. You helped achieve this.

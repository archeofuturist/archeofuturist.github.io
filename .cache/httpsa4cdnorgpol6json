Yet they don&#039;t, why is that? It&#039;s because the House of Saud wants nothing but the destruction of Europe.

Basically it&#039;s a 2D spacesim with waifus. Setting is a mix of sci-fi and cyberpunk with greedy corporations and shit. Currently we trying to get funded on IndieGoGo. I need your help on redpill related jokes. So far I thought about feminazis as main enemy and enforcers of corporations, reptiloids as secret boss and few kinda muslim colonials-planets named Neo Sweden and Neo England. I need your ideas, possible references, more subtlety, I can&#039;t go full memelands retard. Nothing of this is final, I really would like to hear your ideas. If the project gets funded and the game becomes commercially successful I plan further to counter pro-left and anti-consumer tendencies in gaming industry.<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/b51Xyrupsb8 [Embed]<br>Last thread accidentally drowned <a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/120672040#p120672040\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120672040<\/a>. <br>But now we may feature fashwave tracks from anon and Chile helicopters reference.","filename":"logo2","ext":".gif","w":736,"h":490,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1491959146042,"time":1491959146,"md5":"Q8PfsL27V6CxcIuwfQOPZQ==","fsize":265128,"resto":0,"id":"1PpExuS6","country":"RU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"hello-anons-im-making-pol-influenced-vidya","country_name":"Russian Federation","replies":11,"images":4,"omitted_posts":6,"omitted_images":1},{"no":120694993,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)21:49:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120693579\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120693579<\/a><br>thanks, i already thought about getting it drowned and go to sleep.","time":1491961768,"resto":120689440,"id":"1PpExuS6","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":120695291,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)21:51:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120694990\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120694990<\/a><br>dunno, sounds unscientific.

The right is about the idea that everyone is unequal. All humans are born with different capacity and fit in their place in a natural hierarchy. Communism was a misguided attempt by a group of intellectual elites (predominately Jewish) to force everyone to be equal at the barrel of a gun. They believed that once their dream was achieved common people would be free to go after intellectual pursuits and there would be a Mozart on every street corner. The left still chases this ideal but they have disavowed Communism since it ended up being so violent which is antithetical to their moral system. The &quot;right&quot; in modern Western politics still embraces the left&#039;s core ideal of equality, they just believe it is achievable through free markets rather than government enforcement. Hitler&#039;s national socialism was big government but its core value system was right wing. Men are men, women are women, greater men are above lesser men, all work together in their place for the advancement of civilization. It had strong ties to traditionalist pre-Christian Europe.","time":1490861204,"resto":118894657,"id":"Tjae4wMQ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118871234,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)22:43:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"Rob Schneider is officially \/ourguy\/<br><br>This explains why he no longer hangs around (((Adam Sandler))) and why he&#039;s blackballed in Hollywood.","filename":"rob redpilled","ext":".png","w":549,"h":321,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":146,"tim":1490841826143,"time":1490841826,"md5":"dAl9+dvqqlyS6H7U7JvydA==","fsize":52335,"resto":0,"id":"TlSPM32t","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"rob-schneider-is-officially-ourguy","country_name":"Canada","replies":161,"images":32,"omitted_posts":156,"omitted_images":32,"tail_size":50},{"no":118899718,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)03:55:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118871234\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118871234<\/a><br>I thought he was a carrot?!","filename":"whole-story","ext":".jpg","w":781,"h":546,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":87,"tim":1490860544748,"time":1490860544,"md5":"0oJAsN9HhovtNPbEZIFtBQ==","fsize":135912,"resto":118871234,"id":"UpJJ22pa","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118899727,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)03:55:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118872182\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118872182<\/a><br>DEeerrrrp!!!","time":1490860553,"resto":118871234,"id":"dgfTw4DZ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118899880,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)03:57:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118873409\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118873409<\/a><br>Top Kek, thanks based bean. <br>Hope you invest wisely this summer.","time":1490860675,"resto":118871234,"id":"p9CnuXUH","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118900095,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)04:01:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118873136\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118873136<\/a><br><a href=\"#p118883424\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118883424<\/a><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=fov<wbr>LqEd2cWI","filename":"elijah-wood-004","ext":".jpg","w":550,"h":550,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490860862776,"time":1490860862,"md5":"s3y16Gw1pNpLynm\/eqC8gA==","fsize":74623,"resto":118871234,"id":"ogZqAxTf","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118900468,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)04:06:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118899718\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118899718<\/a><br>or how about the little shits pay like everione else?","time":1490861174,"resto":118871234,"id":"C+z8eupL","country":"RO","country_name":"Romania"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118896474,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)03:08:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"What went wrong?","filename":"Hillary Clinton","ext":".jpg","w":460,"h":259,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1490857686989,"time":1490857686,"md5":"TQqNzcq13b1Az1qPOcgoBQ==","fsize":15763,"resto":0,"id":"ptHYG6nb","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"what-went-wrong","country_name":"United States","replies":30,"images":4,"omitted_posts":25,"omitted_images":3},{"no":118898902,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)03:43:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118896474\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118896474<\/a><br>8 years of Dem mismanagement<br>Shitlary trying to campaign on social media.<br><br>\/pol\/&#039;s social media campaign also didn&#039;t work.

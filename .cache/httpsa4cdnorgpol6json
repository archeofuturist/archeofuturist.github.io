He positions his hat into the prime place for the 4th time this passing minute. He then refocuses on his phone, where he drags his thick, greasy sausages for fingers across the cracked screen of the relatively small cell phone, compared to the thick, sweaty platform that was his palm. Finally he could be somewhere where he was accepted. He was proud to be &quot;alt-right&quot; as he referred to himself when talking with his family members at the dinner table. He sat back and sunk his feet down into the wet, greasy carpet some more. He spun his swivel chair around to look at the several gaming posters pinned to the wall. Many of them covered in stains of various fluids and peeling away from the wall. Super Mario Sunshine, Legend Of Zelda, Ocarina of Time, Earthbound, and even ones of anime too, like Lucky Star or Neon Genesis. Such nostalgic posters brought a feeling of youth over him. He was happy. With his blinds closed so nobody could see inside, and his creaky door with many stains from his youth locked shut, so his parents could not intrude him. Wiping his grimy, chunk hand over his face to get rid of all the grease and sweat that accumulated in the last 30 seconds, he dragged his chair up to his desk and opened up a new browser. That damn dinosaur of his, taking forever to open a program. From his msn.com homepage, he pecked in &quot;paheal&quot; into the search bar and anxiously waited as his cargo shorts became more sweater and greasier, much like his uncleansed beard. With his face glued to his screen, he dashed in &quot;ivanka trump futanari&quot; into the R34 search bar. After licking the cheeto crumbs off his lips, he smothered his phone with his plump, voluptuous pile of flesh that he called his hand and opened up his 4chan app. He saw somebody commented in his thread, &quot; Kill yourself, you fatass shill. &quot; The look of shock on his face was impeccable.<\/span>","time":1493528215,"resto":123424749,"id":"ZvDUJuPA","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":123437986,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)00:52:44","name":"Anonymous","sub":"A functioning EU single market requires 3 things","com":"Labor mobility, flexibility of real wages, and a common fiscal policy.

In a free market with free banking and a naturally DEFLATIONARY currency, as production and automation increases, prices for capital and consumer goods fall. People would need to work less hours to get the money they need to have a comfortable life. Many more people would be working part time, like 2-3 days a week which would only open up slots for more people to work. Also people would be retiring much earlier which also decreases unemployment. As the price of capital goods falls it creates a massive high paying service sector industry that will create countless jobs. There would be no unemployment.

You mean allow them to live as second class citizens as long as they pay jizya? Muhammad&#039;s successors waged war on Christians and Jews so this is the bare minimum criticism that can also be levied against big MO and the caliphs themselves. There are more passages on waging war on non Muslims and taking them as slaves, which can be used to theologically redeem such actions from the perspective of the perpetrator. Salafi Muslims base their actions and ideologies on historical accounts of the behavior of the followers of Muhammad, by such a metric the behavior of Isis is relatively unsurprising.","time":1492479473,"resto":121614384,"id":"pYDOsoNT","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121617738,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)21:40:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121617346\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121617346<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;of the followers of Muhammad<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;but not Mohammad himself<\/span><br>They were bad Muslims then.<br>Read the Qur&#039;an","time":1492479646,"resto":121614384,"id":"+xaOZQgZ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":121617704,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)21:40:32","name":"PFSIC1","sub":"SEVENS EXPOSED","com":"Did you give up on an ez puzzle?","filename":"guilty","ext":".jpg","w":502,"h":1138,"tn_w":110,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492479632384,"time":1492479632,"md5":"K45lvPN0KE49Vmu8OAAJ4w==","fsize":211555,"resto":0,"id":"gmgCInIz","country":"CA","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"sevens-exposed","country_name":"Canada","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":121601307,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)19:28:47","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Paintbucket the Planet CONTINUED","com":"Old thread archived <a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/121566159#p121566159\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121566159<\/a><br>Keep &#039;em coming you worthless cunts.","filename":"okstte9i","ext":".jpg","w":1202,"h":606,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":126,"tim":1492471727659,"time":1492471727,"md5":"D+2DdPrKTdhq6wpcx3MhcA==","fsize":278919,"resto":0,"id":"MvcxlpU3","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"paintbucket-the-planet-continued","country_name":"United States","replies":41,"images":22,"omitted_posts":36,"omitted_images":19},{"no":121614977,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)21:19:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121614572\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121614572<\/a><br>Yeah bud, filtered and hidden.<br><br>Don&#039;t be this retarded in the future.","filename":"Screen-Shot-2016-12-23-at-8.10.40-PM-1280x720","ext":".png","w":1280,"h":720,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1492478344720,"time":1492478344,"md5":"rVa06jlWGyw2sEa8vx+5zg==","fsize":776371,"resto":121601307,"id":"mA8G0\/JD","country":"CA","m_img":1,"country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121615158,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)21:20:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121614977\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121614977<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I can&#039;t handle information that is different from my opinions so I hide from it!!<\/span>","time":1492478427,"resto":121601307,"id":"nySoUUIh","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121615968,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)21:27:05","name":"Anonymous","filename":"1492457687166","ext":".jpg","w":5235,"h":2483,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":59,"tim":1492478825681,"time":1492478825,"md5":"XnqEgIU4MHGDbSkSyIpq4A==","fsize":832124,"resto":121601307,"id":"YkWKFb19","country":"BR","m_img":1,"country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":121616049,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)21:27:44","name":"Anonymous","filename":"tru","ext":".png","w":5235,"h":2483,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":59,"tim":1492478864782,"time":1492478864,"md5":"MJ52Hgsf0DF94Byz9FkzbA==","fsize":292201,"resto":121601307,"id":"NdgHGKk4","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121617674,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)21:40:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"don&#039;t know why I bothered filling out the world when all that matters is right here","filename":"mrka","ext":".jpg","w":4603,"h":2731,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":74,"tim":1492479615988,"time":1492479615,"md5":"6Ikye4lEbLI5KN29U24n9Q==","fsize":1046169,"resto":121601307,"id":"NdgHGKk4","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":121615349,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)21:22:00","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Trump","com":"Why is he so stupid?<br><br>Pic related","filename":"IMG_3846","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":671,"tn_w":238,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492478520268,"time":1492478520,"md5":"JY6ILHzM3Pe7aBUYh+6p\/A==","fsize":71702,"resto":0,"id":"HcNm0jRA","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"trump","country_name":"United States","replies":3,"images":0},{"no":121615624,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)21:24:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"Bump","time":1492478656,"resto":121615349,"id":"HcNm0jRA","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121615740,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)21:25:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121615349\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121615349<\/a><br>What.

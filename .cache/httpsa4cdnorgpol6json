Sometimes the elites can help us in situations where an unstable equilibrium is preferable to a more stable but shittier equilibrium. <br>See https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Priso<wbr>ner%27s_dilemma<br>Obviously it is better for both prisoners to stay silent. Each prisoner would prefer it that way. However, acting individually it is unlikely for them to achieve this equilibrium state- they simply aren&#039;t incentivized to stay silent. However, if they were members of a mafia (analogous to the government) threatening them with violence if they betray their partner, then they can be legitimately incentivized to stay silent and both receive the reduced sentence.","time":1490921494,"resto":118989994,"id":"9ZbpqhFu","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118995998,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)20:54:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118989994\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118989994<\/a><br><br>Libertarianism is a self-defeating ideology.<br><br>You can&#039;t create a libertarian utopia by importing savages who are not and will never be libertarian.","time":1490921696,"resto":118989994,"id":"Zqoik+KQ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118987359,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)19:35:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"FINLAND YES","filename":"C8E6FW0VYAAxukj.jpg large","ext":".jpg","w":720,"h":960,"tn_w":187,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490916924307,"time":1490916924,"md5":"gurRkpAtqVicXrlmBdFSsw==","fsize":62770,"resto":0,"id":"YvzpCkxi","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"finland-yes","country_name":"United States","replies":24,"images":7,"omitted_posts":19,"omitted_images":6},{"no":118992637,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)20:22:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118992011\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118992011<\/a><br>I wish I knew how to get a girl.<br><br><a href=\"#p118992383\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118992383<\/a><br>The song takes the point of view of a young man and Ieva\/Eva\/Eeva in Finnish, who sneak away to where everyone is dancing to a polka, and dance all night.","filename":"gona","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":360,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1490919778201,"time":1490919778,"md5":"5uKnn0Jm+mFlCEweojg4xg==","fsize":39779,"resto":118987359,"id":"pza1ogQu","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":118993405,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)20:30:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118987359\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118987359<\/a>","filename":"cover","ext":".jpg","w":465,"h":697,"tn_w":83,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490920213617,"time":1490920213,"md5":"AiRA6Z5\/pLOF7THylLoFsQ==","fsize":57059,"resto":118987359,"id":"PBQZARwH","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118994474,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)20:40:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"hmm i bet this was written by a fine white man and no one else","time":1490920823,"resto":118987359,"id":"KOqSfd2r","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118995475,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)20:49:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"http:\/\/www.philschwarzmann.com\/how-<wbr>my-books-cover-was-designed\/<br><br>&quot;A modern Finnish couple in love!

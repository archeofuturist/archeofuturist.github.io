It&#039;s basically ran like a Japanese school; kids and faculty help maintain shit instead of hiring mexican janitors, kids stay in one classroom instead of running around like cattle save for maintenance, PE, and trade courses. That last bit is why these schools will succeed. When they first arrive, they&#039;ll have an option to choose a trade: Electrical, Plumbing, Coding\/IT, etc, so that way once they graduate, they&#039;ll be certified and ready to work for the city\/state\/military\/PMC companies instead of giving thousands of dollars to worthless colleges. <br><br>Of course it will be a private school but an affordable one, $500 a month, which any parent who really wants their kid to succeed can go and make $125 doing uber 4 saturdays\/sundays out of the month for 6 hours to pay for tuition if they really want them to go that badly.

There are studies and data that PROVE that women who fuck around cannot bond to a mate and are destined to be alone or cheat and just basically be unhappy with any relationship. Part of this is due to bonding chemicals (oxytocin for one) which is also &quot;contained&quot; in saliva AND semen and passes to the woman, but the more different sources of this she receives the less able she is to actually respond to it properly\/biologically and form a bond with any male. It&#039;s much of the same reason lesbians have such a high rate of splitting up and spousal abuse, because they cannot convey to each other the proper amount of bonding chemicals and eventually they realize they&#039;re living in a relationship with someone have no attachment to and who just pisses them off.","time":1490057943,"resto":117562540,"id":"dDz\/1kOX","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":117562803,"now":"03\/20\/17(Mon)20:59:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"Exposing the shills.","filename":"pseudo anti-feminism pol shill","ext":".jpg","w":1777,"h":900,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":63,"tim":1490057988245,"time":1490057988,"md5":"\/9krDlDio5DvvVUzCcG6cA==","fsize":323137,"resto":117562540,"id":"dDz\/1kOX","country":"DE","m_img":1,"country_name":"Germany"},{"no":117562834,"now":"03\/20\/17(Mon)21:00:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117562803\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117562803<\/a>","filename":"pseudo anti-feminism pol shill 2","ext":".jpg","w":1928,"h":2156,"tn_w":111,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490058003073,"time":1490058003,"md5":"3qgPaFT1IE5huAtlkGZV9A==","fsize":556355,"resto":117562540,"id":"dDz\/1kOX","country":"DE","m_img":1,"country_name":"Germany"}]},{"posts":[{"no":117540095,"now":"03\/20\/17(Mon)18:21:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"https:\/\/archive.fo\/NZwT7<br><br>So is he going to &quot;get impeached&quot;, or &quot;resign&quot;?

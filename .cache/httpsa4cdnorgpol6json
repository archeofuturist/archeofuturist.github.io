The economic downturn\/stagflation actually started under Nixon (though Carter took the blame), but wasn&#039;t caused by political action (by Nixon, Ford, or Carter). Basically, Carter is blamed for all sorts of shit he had no control over. In truth he was an average president. Obama also wasn&#039;t shit. He had some serious problems, but I&#039;d still put him in the upper half of presidents. I&#039;m with you on Bush and semi-with you on LBJ (I disagree with much of his policy, but I don&#039;t know that I&#039;d call him shit). Strangely enough, many consider Bill Clinton to be the best president since Eisenhower, but this is due to nothing more than luck that the economy was good, he was average. <br><br><a href=\"#p119710843\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119710843<\/a><br>Don&#039;t forget that Reagan also escalated the drug war causing mass incarceration and super harsh penalties for trivial shit like simple position.

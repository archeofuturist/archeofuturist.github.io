The source is Miller&#039;s literacy survey and ranking (pic related), which is authoritative and very well supported. It does not look at a population&#039;s ability to read but at actually grabbing a book and reading it --moreover, remember that books translated in the whole Arab world in a whole year are 1\/5 of Greece, by far Europe&#039;s most backwards member, and a tiny fraction of the U.S., which is not precisely dandy when it comes down to culture. <br><br>Now, this fact by itself would be a source of scorn and no more. However, it starts to get worrying (and revealing) when collated with two scientifically proven facts: (1) Turks have a ludicrous rate of inbreeding, mostly gestated by the prophet&#039;s encouragement of cousin marrying and the backwards social stigma placed on women who actually socialize outside of their family circle; and (2) inbreeding is linked to a plethora of health problems, from anger and depression to outright retardation and deformity, with its most drastic consequence being the direct correlation with stillbirths.<br><br>Now, with these indisputable facts in our hands, it is would be quite surprising that Erdogan would not have won.

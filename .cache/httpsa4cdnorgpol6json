It was initially ruled by the Aghlabids who were an Arab dynasty descended from the Arabs of Khorasan (Eastern Greater Persia) appointed by the Abbasid Caliph. The army they employed in the conquest Sicily included Arabs, Berbers, and Persians, as well as Muslims from Crete and Andalusia. Arabic appears to have become the predominate language since it was widely spoken even by non-Muslims and was still used for administrative purposes to some degree even after the Norman conquest of the island. Frederick II, the Holy Roman Emperor and King of Sicily was fluent in Arabic even though he ruled in the 13th Century. In 1224, a Muslim uprising in Sicily prompted him to deport many of the Muslims to Lucera in southern mainland Italy. Although that wasn\u2019t the first Muslim presence on mainland Italy, there was also the Emirate of Bari which had only lasted for something like 30 years.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;And Maltese are basically Sicilian, just a little farther out. But they speak a Semitic language, so they might have a little extra &quot;Bedouin&quot; admixture&quot;.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;They speak Sicilian Arabic. It&#039;s not just a Semitic language but in fact an Arabic dialect of recent arrival and therefore unrelated to the &quot;Sicilian anomaly&quot;, which must be much older. <\/span><br>http:\/\/eurogenes.blogspot.fi\/2016\/0<wbr>1\/ancient-greeks-and-romans-may-hav<wbr>e.html","filename":"12647060_ori","ext":".jpg","w":375,"h":221,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":73,"tim":1492271776608,"time":1492271776,"md5":"zg2UqjJw+5D5JAiLkonHxA==","fsize":16308,"resto":121201300,"id":"fCh4NiHe","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":121223706,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)11:56:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121222195\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121222195<\/a><br>The north is raped as we speak. the jews are wining.","time":1492271793,"resto":121201300,"id":"pAOjcszT","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"}]},{"posts":[{"no":121172662,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)01:02:06","name":"Anonymous","sub":"\/HTG\/ HUMAN TRAFFICKING GENERAL 4: BABY BACK RIBS EDITION","com":"These threads are for the purpose of human trafficking investigations.<br><br>The first topic we will focus on is checking out why there seems to be a pattern of abortion clinics and adoption centers right next to marinas and ports.

We\u2019re reared on milk and stories. The narratives of our youth become who we are and what we believe.<br><br>And herein lies a sort of developmental issue for men. One that will be discussed here. Because humans don\u2019t tell their sons stories about the world. We tell them stories about the way we want the world to be.<br><br>So, for all their profundity and magic, stories give us an unrealistic sense of the natural buoyancy of a good man\u2019s life. As we grow into boyhood, the tales we imbibe teach us that the rise of a fine man is inevitable, or that the intrinsic virtue of a man on the correct team will automatically lend him the support of all fellow members of that team. We inculcate the flower of our male youth with the myth that being good comes with a reward. That he, just like any little girl, is valuable for who he is on in the inside. We are taught that we carry intrinsic value within us.<br><br>But we grow up into men. Maybe it is the day we get our draft cards in the mail and the women don\u2019t (despite hearing how women are on the losing side of equality our whole lives). Or we wake up to a news headline reading \u201c500 killed, including three women\u201d in an international newspaper. However it happens, a man who pays attention will one day realize that the world doesn\u2019t give a shit about him\u2014 not in any real sense anyway, and absolutely not (as he\u2019s been taught) in direct proportion to how \u201cgood\u201d he is, or \u201cwhat\u2019s on the inside\u201d of him.<br><br>Quickly after there comes a point then where an enlightened man must stare into a fact of life that has been kept from him (if he was sheltered): that life for him is adversarial in nature, and he must take an adversarial stance within it in order to succeed as a creature.","filename":"uTnjkUY","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":632,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":154,"tim":1491250092351,"time":1491250092,"md5":"eNrAtZ3OFsAPXlBqbSFJXg==","fsize":235848,"resto":0,"id":"j6ugJz9v","country":"IL","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-world-wants-you-to-fail","country_name":"Israel","replies":5,"images":0},{"no":119373521,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)16:08:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"He awakens one morning and the world quietly closes its gate to him, whispering in his ear \u201cyou are only worth what you can earn\u2014 what you can build, create, discover, or kill.

It wants his life to be unremarkable. To be spent supporting others. To be drowned in sweet, romantic thinking while he polishes ball bearings.

One was that there was some kind of astral gate at the bottom of the ocean there and that people were getting teleported to other worlds. Another was that there was some pyramid-like structure at the bottom from the ruins of Atlantis causing electromagnetic interference or something like that. I remember one that even said that massive typhoons were rising from the ocean and swallowing up the planes. The problem with it all is that the theories are wildly different and don&#039;t make enough sense to really be all that justifiable. Plus if you consider the amount of disappearances in other regions of the ocean, they&#039;re aren&#039;t necessarily more common in the Bermuda triangle then they are anywhere else. Not entirely certain on this subject, but that&#039;s my input.","time":1492667589,"resto":121957467,"id":"NE1vj53O","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121960457,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)01:56:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121960136\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121960136<\/a><br>brb going to take a piss while OP googles cuz he&#039;s a LARPer","time":1492667767,"resto":121957467,"id":"1ACK9URF","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":121954952,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)00:58:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"Is she \/pol\/&#039;s waifu?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Frog Girl<\/span>","filename":"299409","ext":".jpg","w":360,"h":360,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492664316051,"time":1492664316,"md5":"14lHfBf4aiAMq0i8YNgm+Q==","fsize":20905,"resto":0,"id":"KkBbzkFR","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"is-she-pols-waifu","country_name":"United States","replies":3,"images":2},{"no":121957416,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)01:24:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"Try \/h\/","time":1492665878,"resto":121954952,"id":"SsILGuif","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121957496,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)01:25:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121954952\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121954952<\/a><br>Who desu?","filename":"1485299651746","ext":".png","w":797,"h":720,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":112,"tim":1492665923961,"time":1492665923,"md5":"0BPjn5sLWGIKGEu\/ZHwaUA==","fsize":651063,"resto":121954952,"id":"w0RhSyJI","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121960454,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)01:56:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121957496\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121957496<\/a><br><br>die","filename":"1453528773569","ext":".jpg","w":228,"h":227,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":124,"tim":1492667766088,"time":1492667766,"md5":"Kaar2Defbd7UAlvuysr1aQ==","fsize":19912,"resto":121954952,"id":"RuVQ8Doa","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":121960444,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)01:56:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"happy birthday hitler","filename":"1492666707940","ext":".png","w":693,"h":1024,"tn_w":169,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492667762315,"time":1492667762,"md5":"HEG0ZMShDTmiS5wiJoPyNw==","fsize":1160425,"resto":0,"id":"NLcCo5BC","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"happy-birthday-hitler","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":121945177,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)23:28:11","name":"Anonymous","sub":"How gays have affected \/pol\/ users","com":"Do any other \/pol\/acks have stories or insight?

Similar to how people want things like Bitcoin to replace the current stagnant bloated monetary system, Uber replacing the licensing and Taxi cartel laws, internet sidestepping copyright &amp; the mainstream media, Libertarians want to see alternatives pop up for everything slowly fading away the functions of government.<br><br>This only happens when you have a larger portion of the pop with that liberty minded culture &amp; business&#039;creating these alternatives. It also breeds decentralization, where you want communities themselves to slowly drift away from needing the federal\/state govs to provide anything.<br><br>States invading is a bit of a silly one because at the end there&#039;s no government or tax structure for them to take over so essentially they&#039;d have to forcibly occupy the entire populace, house to house, town to town and somehow build these structures all over again that may have been rendered irrelevant, by a populace that resists the entire time. It&#039;s a possibility like Ancom Spain but it&#039;s obviously down to the scenario itself and not a general rule. <br><br>Nice talkin to ya, have fun.","time":1493348131,"resto":123119729,"id":"A63hSUCh","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"}]},{"posts":[{"no":123123973,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)21:29:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"Are we losing the meme war \/pol\/?<br>Leftist memes are getting better because they are fighting against the mainstream like we were in 2016. <br>I just saw this posted on my wall, filename was the caption.","filename":"Trump shows off his favorite GameCube game","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":450,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1493342952418,"time":1493342952,"md5":"csTBewkc5ukDzgDBLdZXZA==","fsize":46810,"resto":0,"id":"ynfeIuzL","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"are-we-losing-the-meme-war-pol","country_name":"United States","replies":51,"images":17,"omitted_posts":46,"omitted_images":16},{"no":123132850,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)22:40:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123132032\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123132032<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;you&#039;re one of those antifa faggots.<\/span><br>No see<br><a href=\"#p123130016\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123130016<\/a><br><a href=\"#p123128904\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123128904<\/a>","time":1493347258,"resto":123123973,"id":"ynfeIuzL","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123132999,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)22:42:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"the left still control the media and education. focus memeing there. tbqh I just want to fast-forward to the part where we give these degenerate faggots helicopter rides.","time":1493347320,"resto":123123973,"id":"p5KfJNEw","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":123133488,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)22:45:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123132850\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123132850<\/a><br>Oh, my bad.

Women should be denied the right to vote. Abolish the 19th Amendment.<br>2. Ban women from holding public office.<br>3. Non-married women under law are to be ruled by their fathers. The father by law exclusively without any interference decides who they date and whom they can marry.<br>4. Women should not be allowed in the work place with other males unless the work place segregates females from males.

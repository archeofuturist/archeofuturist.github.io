Genes and their expression are heavily influenced by the environment and the stressors that come with it. These stressors come in the form of both eustress and distress. The longer these genes are expressed in a certain way in response to the environment, the longer they will continue to be expressed independently of environment in their offspring. It will take awhile for the genes to express themselves differently in response to different stressors when introduced to a new environment. However, this is very difficult and examples can actually be seen in southerners. <br><br>In the south, for whatever reason, there were more distressors that elicited a genetic expression of high cortisol levels. Over time, the genes responsible for increased cortisol levels were passed down to the southerner&#039;s offspring and children were being born with elevated cortisol levels and an increased cortisol response to environmental stressors independent of their environment. It is for this reason that southerner&#039;s tend to be more violent than northerners and quicker to anger in general.<br><br>Once those genes are flipped on and expressed in a certain way, they are passed on to children. Unless the environment offers opportunity for different expression of these genes and multigenerational inheritance of these genes, the undesireable expression of these genes will be very difficult to change without mutation.<br><br>Epigenetics is a thing, and it&#039;s the next red pill.","time":1490593141,"resto":118466910,"id":"vWCrj1Ua","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118477833,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)01:40:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ICs<wbr>PQnGJEpY<br><br>Here&#039;s another Sowell video where he talks about wealth, poverty, and politics.","time":1490593252,"resto":118466910,"id":"OLqQbO\/O","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":118478215,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)01:44:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118476244\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118476244<\/a><br>when kids were given IQ tests that were based on inferring how many blocks were stacked in a 3d arrangement, the blacks and whites did about the same on these tests.<br><br>it&#039;s only on the verbal\/reading comprehension that they differed, because the black kids were not educated in reading and writing. somewhere in that video Sowell mentions that the black kids didn&#039;t know the meaning of the word &quot;opposite&quot; so they all failed a certain question. it&#039;s not a lack of intelligence, it&#039;s a lack of knowledge.<br><br>but if you are constantly told in a welfare society that the reason you don&#039;t have what other people have is because they are keeping you down, and you buy into it, you&#039;re not going to try hard in school, and therefore you&#039;ll never gain knowledge.<br><br>that is what has been happening in america since the 1960&#039;s in a nutshell, and now it&#039;s spreading to other places like here","time":1490593486,"resto":118466910,"id":"OLqQbO\/O","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118474211,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)01:01:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"CEO of a Fortune 500 company here.<br><br>Donald Trump is what we in the biz like to call a &quot;big fat orange cunt&quot;.

No way I&#039;m using that!&#039; Therefore, when it came in the mail two days later (thanks Prime!) and my husband installed it, I stood in the hall and informed him that I would still be using toilet paper thank you very much. Fast forward thirty minutes to when my husband &#039;took it for a spin&#039;, as it were, and exclaimed from the bathroom that it was &#039;the most amazing thing ever and I HAD to try it!&#039;<br><br>I put up a good fight, but in the end, my husband&#039;s darling brown eyes won me over, as they always do, and I decided to give it a whirl.<br><br>Oh my sweet mercy hallelujah. It was heaven. A bit startling at first, if you have never used a bidet, but I have never felt cleaner in my whole life! It also has been helpful to those of us who have hemorrhoids (THANKS CHILDBIRTH) because it is a bit gentle and less abrasive than toilet paper tends to be. We haven&#039;t bought toilet paper since we bought it (March, so, 4 months) and I haven&#039;t missed it a bit. My husband and I now fight over using the downstairs bathroom, because the upstairs bathroom is lacking the glorious invention that is the Luxe Neo 120. I should take off a star for wrecking my marriage, Luxe Bidet Neo 120! THANKS.<br><br>As for the bidet itself, it is easy peasy to install (according to my husband; I wouldn&#039;t know because I was having a toilet paper protest in the hall at the time of its installation) and simple to clean for the most part...the back (where it attaches to the toilet) is a bit more difficult to clean than your average, sad, greatly lacking, bidet-less toilet, but nothing major at all. The nozzle where the water shoots out is covered by a neat little &#039;sanitary shield&#039; which is a nice touch. To clean the nozzle itself you simply turn the &#039;self cleaning&#039; knob on the bidet controls and instead of squirting &#039;out&#039; it squirts down to rinse itself off.

I&#039;ve read a lot of stuff about Walt and the Disney corporation being associated with Freemasonry, the Illuminati, CIA mind control\/MKUltra, even theories associating them with Moloch worship and the infamous alleged pedophile rings of Alex Jones\/pizzagate fame...<br><br>I should mention I myself am a Christian occultist, so I don&#039;t consider everything associated with Occult spiritual paths to be &quot;evil&quot;\/Occult. But on the other hand, some of them clearly are. At least on the surface, the messages within Disney films, theme parks, etc. seems to be pro-magick but always demonstrates white magic triumphing over dark. Yet you can&#039;t deny the creepy dystopian fascistic vibes that lurk around the edges of a place like Disneyland...<br><br>I have a lot more thoughts to contribute, this whole things is such a twisted labryinth for me.

Firstly, the sexual imagery is always so subtle or blink-and-you-miss-it, I honestly don&#039;t believe any of the stuff they point to would have any effect on the viewer, not in a psychological or Occult sense. And also, I think it betrays the (IMO) naive worldview that sees any subtle intimation of sex organs or sexuality to be proof of &quot;evil intent&quot;, as though human sexuality is inherently evil or mind-corroding. I don&#039;t believe that to be the case...

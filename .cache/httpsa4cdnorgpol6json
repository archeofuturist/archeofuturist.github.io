Gen. John Rossi, 55, who was just days away from a promotion and taking command of the U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command at Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville, was found by his wife at their home on July 31, 2016.<br>The report into his death concluded that Rossi had questioned whether he would be intellectually capable of taking on his new position while also fixating on men that had died under his command at previous postings. Those issues paired with severe sleep deprivation were deemed to have directly contributed to the 2-star general taking his own life, noted that report.<br>&quot;They ultimately overwhelmed his psychological defenses and ability to cope with these negative emotions, resulting in his decision to commit suicide during the last period of time in which he was likely to be alone before assuming command of the SMDC,&quot; according to the report.","filename":"Screen Shot 2017-03-29 at 1.57.32 PM","ext":".png","w":786,"h":281,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":44,"tim":1490813873573,"time":1490813873,"md5":"IJqgpPWKHCWrJy8mzyw+tw==","fsize":164661,"resto":118818335,"id":"9sZBsV0Q","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118805679,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)12:58:40","name":"Anonymous","sub":"The kikes have been very busy this morning","com":"As you should know, JIDF now is flooding 4chan (and the whole internet) with interracial bs.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;pic related<\/span><br><br>This morning they have been particularly busy on this board:<br><br><span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;118798485<\/span><br><a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/118797922#p118797922\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118797922<\/a><br><a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/118802843#p118802843\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118802843<\/a><br><a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/118793318#p118793318\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118793318<\/a><br><a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/118802285#p118802285\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118802285<\/a><br><a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/118803394#p118803394\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118803394<\/a>","filename":"IMG_0318","ext":".png","w":2268,"h":900,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":99,"tim":1490806720144,"time":1490806720,"md5":"3IFz272mY0RgrAvs8cFgPg==","fsize":300191,"resto":0,"id":"RNq4qv4K","country":"CL","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-kikes-have-been-very-busy-this-morning","country_name":"Chile","replies":47,"images":14,"omitted_posts":42,"omitted_images":14},{"no":118816962,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)14:40:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118805857\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118805857<\/a><br>They&#039;ve been doing it for at least the last 8 years","time":1490812844,"resto":118805679,"id":"uUMvhBU6","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118817233,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)14:43:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118811141\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118811141<\/a><br>The on I don&#039;t get is why bother doing it to \/TV\/? what can they possibly stand to gain from it?","time":1490812990,"resto":118805679,"id":"x+QbGZsK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118817929,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)14:48:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118805679\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118805679<\/a><br>keep this thread going","time":1490813334,"resto":118805679,"id":"qw5EHK6Q","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":118818505,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)14:54:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"To add, pic related is fake news and there&#039;s several threads up about it.

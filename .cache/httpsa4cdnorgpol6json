We were both 18 at marriage and I want to wait a little to have kids, I want to be able to work and have at least some fun before I&#039;m like 28 and I decide to have some kids.

Much more so than me. Kind of fucking annoying about it honestly. She still prays 5 times a day, will only eat halal food (and only cooks halal food, sigh). She reads and studies the Quran and hates if I drink, which kind of sucks because I love drinking. But it&#039;s also great because we barely get into arguments because Muslim women are technically not allowed to argue with their husbands, or raise their voice to a man. She doesn&#039;t work or anything either. I have to go the Masjid because of her and sometimes that sucks but I deal with it haha. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;How&#039;d you two end up together?<\/span><br>Knew her literally since I can remember. We grew up in the same community, were family friends, and by the time we were about 15, we started talking to each other and knew that we wanted to date. But since Muslims aren&#039;t allowed to &quot;date&quot; per se, I just started hanging out with her more often, and then asked her father if I was permitted to start seeing her. 3 long awkward years of &quot;dates&quot; with her whole family around, and both our families agreed to marry us. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; I wonder how many Muzzies are secretly redpilled<\/span><br><br>Lots. Some are huge cucks but most Muslims are extremely conservative, it&#039;s just that they tend to be narrow minded and only see Islam as the one true ideology.

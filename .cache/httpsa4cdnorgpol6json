Basically, the only thing that can possibly prove a large scale conspiracy can be covered up, if conspiracies being covered up for decades and only being revealed later does not prove it, is evidence which will literally never be discovered.<br><br>Of course, in pointing out this flaw with their logic, one also points out a flaw in conspiracy therorists logic, they don&#039;t know exactly how many conspiracies have been successfully covered up, because the success of the cover up directly eliminates the possibility of you being able to figure out for sure if said conspiracy was covered up.<br><br>Thus why people never come to a conclusion at this point, both conspiracy therorists and those against them make arbitrary assumptions that can&#039;t really be proven.<br><br>Probably the best approach to discovering how often large conspiracies are covered up are looking at ones that were covered up for decades and then got revealed which OP is already doing. Logically, if there were many conspiracy therories that got covered up for decades, where there&#039;s smoke there&#039;s fire, and there are probably a few larger ones that got covered up forever.<br><br>Still OP, I think you&#039;re doing most of what you can do to convince your friend, but you&#039;re both coming to the table making assumptions neither of you can actually prove ultimately, and you will never be able to convince eachother the other is wrong because of said assumptions.","time":1491167644,"resto":119240700,"id":"QmLFJmqI","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119246973,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)17:15:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119240700\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119240700<\/a><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=PSt<wbr>pvviPgxk","time":1491167735,"resto":119240700,"id":"KjfGNfU6","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119247524,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)17:21:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119246973\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119246973<\/a><br>This won&#039;t convince the informed non conspiracy theorists because they know major news networks buy stories from news wire organizations and such.<br><br>This is only surprising to people that don&#039;t truly know how the media works.

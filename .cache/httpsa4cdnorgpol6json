The Lonicera fly is an example of a novel animal species that resulted from natural hybridization. The American red wolf appears to be a hybrid species between gray wolf and coyote,[29] although its taxonomic status has been a subject of controversy.[30][31][32] The European edible frog is a semi-permanent hybrid between pool frogs and marsh frogs. The edible frog population requires the continued presence of at least one of the parent species.[33] Cave paintings indicate that the European bison is a natural hybrid of the aurochs and the steppe bison.[34][35]<br><br>Hybrid species of plants are much more common than animals. Many crop species are hybrids, including notably the polyploid wheats: some have four sets of chromosomes (tetraploid) or six (hexaploid), while other wheat species have (like most eukaryotic organisms) two sets (diploid), so hybridization events likely involved the doubling of chromosome sets, causing immediate genetic isolation.[36]<br><br>Hybridization may be important in speciation in some plant groups. However, homoploid hybrid speciation (not increasing the number of sets of chromosomes) may be rare: by 1997, only 8 natural examples had been fully described. Experimental studies suggest that hybridization offers a rapid route to speciation, a prediction confirmed by the fact that early generation hybrids and ancient hybrid species have matching genomes, meaning that once hybridization has occurred, the new genome can remain stable.[37]<br><br>Many hybrid zones are known where the ranges of two species meet, and hybrids are continually produced in great numbers. These hybrid zones are useful as biological model systems for studying the mechanisms of speciation. Recently DNA analysis of a bear shot by a hunter in the North West Territories confirmed the existence of naturally-occurring and fertile grizzly\u2013polar bear hybrids.[38]<br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hybri<wbr>d_(biology)","time":1491125417,"resto":119142421,"id":"fCsP3hzM","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119185037,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)05:58:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119151000\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119151000<\/a><br>I picked a hell of a day to stop sniffing glue!","filename":"no_feed_awoos","ext":".jpg","w":375,"h":500,"tn_w":93,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491127085723,"time":1491127085,"md5":"5NTsTSP9axFIe7EF\/BcKrA==","fsize":154889,"resto":119142421,"id":"INOc34uR","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119185577,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)06:08:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119142421\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119142421<\/a><br>Development of Cultures are unable to grow naturally because of higher Powers which lead to An unnatural society which feels off","time":1491127681,"resto":119142421,"id":"AABqCOtm","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"}]},{"posts":[{"no":119175884,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)03:07:56","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Be British Empire, heroically win a war against Germany","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;establish domination over half of Europe<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;rule the world together with American yankees<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;join the EU to keep ruling Europe after colonies lost<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;get Polish workers in<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;atmosphere turns sour, all Brits want to leave Europe<\/span><br><br>Are Polish people to blame for Germany dominating Europe once again?","filename":"Screen Shot 2017-04-02 at 9.05.58 AM","ext":".png","w":1204,"h":1382,"tn_w":217,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491116876150,"time":1491116876,"md5":"fuoG\/99UMp6zoI+K40cPUg==","fsize":1198615,"resto":0,"id":"rdHNzLow","country":"AT","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"be-british-empire-heroically-win-a-war-against","country_name":"Austria","replies":260,"images":40,"omitted_posts":255,"omitted_images":39,"tail_size":50},{"no":119185268,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)06:02:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119176110\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119176110<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;the EU objectively serves to make Germany stronger<\/span><br>Hahaha, what?","time":1491127363,"resto":119175884,"id":"UNS\/WnF8","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":119185366,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)06:04:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119176502\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119176502<\/a><br>All the more reaso for the Vi\u0161egrad group to expand to Slovenia and Croatia so we can hold thrm back.","time":1491127475,"resto":119175884,"id":"rfltyW+9","country":"HR","country_name":"Croatia"},{"no":119185460,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)06:06:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;HAHAHA WE WON <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;WE WON YOU HEAR ME?<\/span><br>What a sad joke.","time":1491127566,"resto":119175884,"id":"KylDL2yn","country":"HU","country_name":"Hungary"},{"no":119185493,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)06:06:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"brits are scum","time":1491127602,"resto":119175884,"id":"dcrdwFHy","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":119185575,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)06:08:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119180208\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119180208<\/a><br>Fuck off pikey.<br>Most slavs would vote for leaving because we hate communism.<br><br>Fuck it, in Austria we voted FPO and the Auscucks went full libtard.","time":1491127680,"resto":119175884,"id":"rfltyW+9","country":"HR","country_name":"Croatia"}]},{"posts":[{"no":119185570,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)06:07:54","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Kurds and their stupidity","com":"Why the fuck are kurds more dense than a black hole!?!?!

They may not feel it 100% of the time just like a bipolar person may not feel depressed 100% of the time.<br><br>Transsexual = Transgender person experiencing gender dysphoria who has transitioned to their identified sex<br><br>Long version:<br><br>Gender dysphoria, or gender identity disorder (GID) is a physiological disorder resulting in a person having the phenotype of one sex, but a clinically diagnosed level of distress due to a conflict between their sex and the sex they mentally associate with, often represented in measurable differences in brain chemistry and hormones.<br><br>Psychological therapy has been shown to be ineffective; seeing a shrink can&#039;t fix a physiological issue, but it does help manage the other symptoms that may result from it, such as depression or other mental illnesses.<br><br>The leading biological treatment is hormone treatment, wherein a person is treated with the opposite sex&#039;s hormones, resulting in a more correct phenotype. Sex reassignment surgery is also another option. Hormone therapy has been shown to account for approximately 90% reduction in the rate of depression among trans people.(http:\/\/www.medscape.com\/vie<wbr>warticle\/827713)<br><br>Being trans has nothing to do with &quot;deciding&quot; to feel some way, or flipping back and forth. Being transsexual is literally the state of being treated for gender dysphoria.<br><br>Thanks for reading. I encourage you to rethink your predispositions about these people, and stop being part of the problem. This is not an ideological or religious issue -- I myself am a straight, married, jewish conservative -- it&#039;s an issue of rejecting accepted medical science.","filename":"for dummies","ext":".jpg","w":396,"h":127,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":80,"tim":1491127546388,"time":1491127546,"md5":"E881dj2uaUbMk76CRLgLqw==","fsize":12333,"resto":0,"id":"sO8pNM8P","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"gender-dysphoria-for-dummies","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0},{"no":119185478,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)06:06:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"Important note for readers, gender dysphoria is not a synonym for transgenderism.","time":1491127584,"resto":119185440,"id":"sO8pNM8P","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":119178897,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)04:04:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"This is right now a top headline in one of Germanys top newspapers. <br>Translation &quot;how to get out of the monogamy prison&quot; and it&#039;s written by a white German woman of course.","filename":"Screenshot_2017-04-02-10-01-46-1","ext":".png","w":720,"h":1012,"tn_w":177,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491120281602,"time":1491120281,"md5":"HETNe8c0xHu1GGT3uYZF4A==","fsize":338110,"resto":0,"id":"eRMEPev7","country":"LU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"this-is-right-now-a-top-headline-in-one-of","country_name":"Luxembourg","replies":46,"images":10,"omitted_posts":41,"omitted_images":10},{"no":119183703,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)05:33:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119178897\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119178897<\/a><br>Welt is a trans-antlantic news outlet, obviously you cannot take them seriously and many reader knows this, check out the comments","time":1491125610,"resto":119178897,"id":"WJbcFVZt","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119183811,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)05:35:43","name":"KILL EVERYTHING BROWN","com":"<a href=\"#p119178897\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119178897<\/a><br>Of course.

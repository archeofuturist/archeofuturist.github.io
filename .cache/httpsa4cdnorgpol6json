The crisis of the welfare state requires new blood so as to feed the panoply of government programs politicians put in place so as to buy themselves new constituencies. Since the white population of the west, perhaps in part because of the tax burden imposed on it due to this very welfare state, has elected not to replace itself naturally, government have little choice but to place their natural heir into a state of complete marginalization at the benefit of of minorities so as to insure that the state will have some taxable base in the future to insure the sustainability of its redistribution programs.","time":1492694158,"resto":121978617,"id":"\/fvO+mob","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121994618,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)09:31:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121993434\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121993434<\/a><br>From Raico, historian of the libertarians:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;That states lends itself legitimacy through the welfare state by buying off more and more constituencies.

How could this end? I don&#039;t see that the welfare state is gonna come to an end by itself. What I see is that as it becomes more and more intractable as we approach the crisis of the welfare state there will -- the politicians and the people in control of the system -- will bring in what has already been suggested by politicians in Europe, including in Germany for instance, and that is &quot;What we need are &#039;young&#039; taxpayers to support the pension and the medical care and so on for the retired older non taxpayers now, retired people. Where are these young taxpayer to come from since the Europeans don&#039;t seem to be very interested in having kids? And in America the white population does not replace itself. So where are these new taxpayers to come from? And that is then from the third world.

I mean there&#039;s an Italian STATE, but there&#039;s no such thing as an Italian identity that is one third muslim or moore for that matter. So they&#039;ll destroy the identity of the European peoples and eventually the American people [...] and I don&#039;t think anybody could have predicted that [...] that in order to salvage this never ending system of welfare [...] they would have to simply destroy the historical identity of the countries.<\/span><br><br>https:\/\/mises.org\/library\/10-classi<wbr>cal-liberalism-and-welfare-warfare-<wbr>state","filename":"Ralph Raico 2005","ext":".jpg","w":240,"h":299,"tn_w":100,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492695062538,"time":1492695062,"md5":"0RLqG1mObGyzQkQQBJAUlg==","fsize":9952,"resto":121978617,"id":"\/fvO+mob","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121995100,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)09:36:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121993330\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121993330<\/a><br>I can give you another philosopher&#039;s trick:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;no one would WILLINGLY be in error if they could avoid it<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;some people chose on the basis of error<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;(they are in error has to what is good for them)<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;but I, superior philosopher, have pierced the true secret of knowledge and-or life<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;thus my pronouncements on what&#039;s good should trump the will of those lower people who were not blessed with a superior intellect and-or a philosophical education<\/span>","time":1492695411,"resto":121978617,"id":"\/fvO+mob","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]},{"posts":[{"no":121995093,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)09:36:43","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Black Kids Bully White Toddler","com":"http:\/\/truthisahatecrime.blogspot.c<wbr>om\/#!\/2013\/08\/black-kids-bully-whit<wbr>e-toddler.html<br><br>This probably redpilled a lot of people who thought that Diversity is our Strength.<br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=w9v<wbr>BHAyVmWQ","filename":"1469880056273","ext":".jpg","w":635,"h":498,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":196,"tim":1492695403157,"time":1492695403,"md5":"w37iihc0SpJvlAkjVBXqKg==","fsize":64133,"resto":0,"id":"d9cedPNW","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"black-kids-bully-white-toddler","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":121995090,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)09:36:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;2015 was the year of the sjw<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;2016 was the year of the alt-right<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;2017 is increasingly becoming the year of the antifa<\/span><br>Will 2018 be the year of the unironic national socialist?","filename":"D3C9CE41-2B1E-4B53-A9CB-640AF31F9991-300-0000001953DA1605","ext":".jpg","w":271,"h":186,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":171,"tim":1492695401569,"time":1492695401,"md5":"pl4x1Ot\/NfqAlFP04hFTug==","fsize":11029,"resto":0,"id":"2D3Rime+","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"2015-was-the-year-of-the-sjw","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":121995062,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)09:36:16","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Admit it \/pol\/, you love these islamic songs.","com":"Admit it \/pol\/, you love these islamic songs:<br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=hlW<wbr>RiEM7Zio<br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=f2i<wbr>vub38kOI<br><br>Hoor la yin<br>Tunadini<br>Fedaini<br>Humma hudaini<br><br>You can&#039;t NOT LOVE this.

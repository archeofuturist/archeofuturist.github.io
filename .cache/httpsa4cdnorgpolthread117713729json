No One Calls 911.","com":"This makes me fucking livid.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;A group of boys allegedly raped a 15-year-old Chicago girl, streamed the attack live on Facebook, while roughly 40 people watched the savage assault live and did nothing about it.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Fox News reports that police only discovered what had happened after the girl\u2019s mother approached Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson as he was leaving a news conference at the 10th District police station in the Lawndale neighborhood late Monday.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The girl\u2019s mother showed Johnson screenshots of the alleged assault, according to Johnson\u2019s spokesman Anthony Guglielmi. Johnson told WGN-TV, \u201cWhat\u2019s even more disturbing, more than the fact that they did this, there were so many people that saw this and they didn\u2019t pick up the phone and dial 911. That\u2019s just not right and (we\u2019re) working on it and try to bring it to a successful resolution.\u201d<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Johnson ordered an investigation; the police department asked Facebook to pull the video off the Internet. Her mother showed WGN News four screens grabs that WGN reported are too graphic for TV.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The Chicago Tribune stated that the girl, a Lane Tech freshman, was reported missing after she didn\u2019t return to her Lawndale home after going to the store. The girl\u2019s uncle reportedly saw the Facebook Live video showing the boys raping his niece. The girl wasn\u2019t found until Tuesday morning; police said she appeared to be in \u201cgood condition\u201d and was returned to her mother.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;On Monday, before the girl was found, the mother said, \u201cI just want her home. I just want to make sure she\u2019s ok cause I know she\u2019s probably scared and embarrassed. I just want her back home.\u201d<\/span><br><br>http:\/\/www.dailywire.com\/news\/14635<wbr>\/chicago-teens-livestream-rape-15-y<wbr>ear-old-girl-no-hank-berrien","filename":"rape","ext":".png","w":966,"h":612,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":158,"tim":1490153387804,"time":1490153387,"md5":"esH6oZ6NlgnbjfbpR70mAQ==","fsize":850658,"resto":0,"id":"5wb9TgqX","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"chicago-teens-livestream-rape-of-15yearold-girl","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

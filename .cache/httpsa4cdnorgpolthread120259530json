I&#039;m not even some salty Sanders fag, she was just a fucking horrendous candidate and human being. We may not agree on everything rightwingers, but thank you so much for ending the political career of that corrupt, narcissistic, nepotistic hack. I genuinely smile every time I think about her loss. I often go back and watch videos of her supporters and cronies melting down because it fills me with intense levels of joy I cannot obtain elsewhere. Seriously, from the bottom of my heart, thank you.","filename":"1491333738429","ext":".gif","w":800,"h":430,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":134,"tim":1491726788767,"time":1491726788,"md5":"5PEX2chDCv6qDysem2Y82w==","fsize":918625,"resto":0,"id":"5c2GNCP6","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"im-a-liberal-but-i-am-thankful-every-fucking-day","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

As cliched as it is, the Strong People, Good Times dictum holds true. The worst the US had to deal with in the 90&#039;s was Columbine, and our President&#039;s sex drive. People were complacent, it was too comfy. and the most complacent ones of all? The baby boomers, none other than the mothers and fathers of the Millenials. They raised them with this mentality, that the government will be there to help you get your antipsycho mess, to protect you from the big bad dictators, so long as you complied. Theyre sheltered, arrogant, entitled, and above all, clueless, because they take after their parents, and were a product of a better time period.","filename":"1452107331281","ext":".jpg","w":476,"h":353,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":92,"tim":1492813109696,"time":1492813109,"md5":"PVLGkPj5qcyBNWQN5yfzsg==","fsize":25626,"resto":122193362,"id":"ZpXYF3cw","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122194537,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)18:20:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122193524\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122193524<\/a><br>This.","time":1492813244,"resto":122193362,"id":"AvRVr56j","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122194897,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)18:23:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;buuurp<\/span><br>christ do people actually find this show intellectual?","time":1492813426,"resto":122193362,"id":"758Vmf9u","country":"HK","country_name":"Hong Kong"},{"no":122195060,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)18:25:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122194273\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122194273<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Colombine<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;the 90&#039;s<\/span><br>We&#039;ve got a minor here!","time":1492813513,"resto":122193362,"id":"YGNW9qxR","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122195097,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)18:25:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122193362\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122193362<\/a><br>Their parents didn&#039;t beat them.","time":1492813532,"resto":122193362,"id":"6Ds70Uh0","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122195150,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)18:25:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122194273\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122194273<\/a><br><br>This.

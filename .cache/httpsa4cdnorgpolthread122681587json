Middle is to change places with the High. The aim of the Low, when they have an aim -a characteristic of the Low that they are too much crushed by drudgery to be too aware -- is to abolish all distinctions and create a society in which all men shall be equal<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;For long periods the High seem securely in power, but sooner or later there comes a moment when they lose either belief in themselves, or their capacity to govern efficiently or both. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;They are then overthrown by the Middle, who enlist the Low on their side by pretending to them that they are fighting for liberty and justice.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;As soon as they have reached their objective, the Middle thrust the Low back into their old position of servitude, and themselves become the High. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Presently a new Middle group splits off from one of the other groups, or from both of them, and the struggle begins over again. Of the three groups, only the Low are never even temporarily successful in achieving their aims. <\/span><br><br>Why do you shill for the middles? If you&#039;re a middle, why do you manipulate the lows? You bourgeois cunts. All revolution is pointless as all we will ever do is change the players, not the game.","filename":"1984","ext":".jpg","w":468,"h":551,"tn_w":212,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493088733221,"time":1493088733,"md5":"kPc\/7iLCgdwWfbdzDap37w==","fsize":114333,"resto":0,"id":"MIRrl\/\/3","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"orwells-reddest-pill","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":7,"images":1,"unique_ips":7},{"no":122681776,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)22:53:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122681587\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122681587<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;siding with Lows, who never ever win<\/span><br>And that&#039;s why communism is a failed ideology","time":1493088832,"resto":122681587,"id":"IERWWh0y","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122681892,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)22:54:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122681587\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122681587<\/a><br>fuck poor people.

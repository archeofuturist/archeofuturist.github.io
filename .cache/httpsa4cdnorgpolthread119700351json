Kind of, though, just sucks because it doesn&#039;t go into it nicely.","time":1491466634,"resto":119700351,"id":"ms9VVZYX","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119721013,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)04:20:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119718256\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119718256<\/a><br>I think this video is common core some fucked up way of doing shit nowadays","time":1491466832,"resto":119700351,"id":"u9I5Gkpx","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119721089,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)04:22:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"black girls are gross","time":1491466931,"resto":119700351,"id":"SrJR2IG5","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119721123,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)04:22:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119700351\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119700351<\/a><br>I cannot view the video but from what i gather its division?<br><a href=\"#p119717703\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119717703<\/a><br>This is mostly how were taught to do it here and the<br><a href=\"#p119713110\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119713110<\/a><br>This i use if im dividing with numbers above 10 or if the number i have to divide is really big and keeping all the information of previous calculations of chunks of the number would become difficult.","time":1491466965,"resto":119700351,"id":"\/nfhNKOw","country":"RS","country_name":"Serbia"},{"no":119721130,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)04:22:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119704613\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119704613<\/a><br>Jesus christ that picture had me rolling.","time":1491466974,"resto":119700351,"id":"acfH28BC","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119721149,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)04:23:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=XBL<wbr>cuGunRxU black teacher song","time":1491466994,"resto":119700351,"id":"u9I5Gkpx","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119721166,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)04:23:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119721013\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119721013<\/a><br><br>Its actually not, thats long division, but what the boon doesn&#039;t understand is that problem is not complex enough to use on such a simple problem.<br><br>Long division is manual math for problems that cannot be done mentally.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;98235\/12 is a great example.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;312\/2 should be solvable in ones head.<\/span>","time":1491467010,"resto":119700351,"id":"1aIjkf75","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119721179,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)04:23:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;tfw shit at maths<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;tfw has never effected me in the slightest<\/span>","time":1491467022,"resto":119700351,"id":"zPnuYO5E","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119721202,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)04:24:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119701854\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119701854<\/a><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/6m6s-ulE6LY","time":1491467052,"resto":119700351,"id":"ZW76IZyx","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119721218,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)04:24:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119720843\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119720843<\/a><br>Just use this method <a href=\"#p119713110\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119713110<\/a> for things you cannot do inside your head, it makes every number pretty easy.","time":1491467065,"resto":119700351,"id":"\/nfhNKOw","country":"RS","country_name":"Serbia"},{"no":119721275,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)04:25:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119700351\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119700351<\/a><br>give me black pussy<br><br>REEEEEEEEEE","time":1491467131,"resto":119700351,"id":"xLBaFc+C","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":119721279,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)04:25:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119701668\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119701668<\/a><br>Not only asians, basically anyone who&#039;s not a nigger.<br>I&#039;d kill myself if I had to go to a class like that.","time":1491467135,"resto":119700351,"id":"L6fNgINp","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":119721325,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)04:26:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119721149\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119721149<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;implying that shit is ANYWHERE near as cringy as the dopey ass shit white people have done in the past<\/span><br><br>Admit it","time":1491467175,"resto":119700351,"id":"1aIjkf75","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119721326,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)04:26:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119721218\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119721218<\/a><br>That method is literally just division, though.

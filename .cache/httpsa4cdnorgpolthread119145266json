The nation was already heavily divided, and that was done by the Democrats adopting identity politics and segregating their own voting base away from white people. Trump is the result of this division, not its creator. The people who voted Trump in didn&#039;t want lower taxes or less government spending or a return to traditional values. Trump represents none of these things in reality, he&#039;s a populist and has huge infrastructure spending plans. What he does represent is 100% pure refined pain and suffering for special snowflakes and leftist faggots. People didn&#039;t vote for him because he was the best candidate, they voted for him purely out of spite for leftist politics and to watch them suffer.","time":1491021885,"resto":119145266,"id":"M\/7znuun","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119146053,"now":"04\/01\/17(Sat)00:50:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"GREAT FLAMING HAIRSWOOSH","time":1491022220,"resto":119145266,"id":"8\/zXT4Eo","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119146328,"now":"04\/01\/17(Sat)00:53:39","name":"Samurai Shia from the future","com":"<a href=\"#p119145557\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119145557<\/a><br>I feels bad for countries killing itself, for political reasons.","time":1491022419,"resto":119145266,"id":"LCoufNT3","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"}]}

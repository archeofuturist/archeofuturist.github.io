Tony got into a fight with resistance over some bullshit and he kicked resistance from the chat and blocked him so we couldn&#039;t let him back in. the problem is that tony had kicked resistance from all the chats (the main chat, the anime chats, the backup chats, literally everything) anyway I got angry, since resistance is my friend so I kept asking tony to unblock him and he kept saying no, so I ended up kicking tony out of the chat and adding in one of his alts as a consolation because I still liked tony. <br><br>While all of this is happening, Tonys wife Allyson is in a major fight with bunnie. What they are fighting about is really juicy but not important right now, so i&#039;ll describe it later. anyway Allyson gets so mad that she literally makes shit up about bunnie sending death threats or some bullshit like that, so twitter bans bunnie from twitter. This made us all angry because bunnie is the girlfriend of a proponent poster in the chat and is basically the queen of \/sg\/ twitter. in response, I got mad and called allyson autistic<br><br>the allyson vs bunnie drama and the tony vs resistance drama makes them both so massively butthurt that tony and allyson storm off and create their own chats.","filename":"ryan","ext":".jpg","w":519,"h":136,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":32,"tim":1490845031757,"time":1490845031,"md5":"oGfTK8u8CboWBy\/ERuQF9w==","fsize":37680,"resto":118855697,"id":"ICHPcyJZ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118877428,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)23:41:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118877031\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118877031<\/a><br>that just sounds stupid desu","time":1490845261,"resto":118855697,"id":"9vrKReOT","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":118877653,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)23:43:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118877031\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118877031<\/a><br>and it once again proves women ruin everything","time":1490845387,"resto":118855697,"id":"9vrKReOT","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":118878200,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)23:48:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118869595\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118869595<\/a><br><a href=\"#p118869919\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118869919<\/a><br>Well, technically they did reach their goal of dividing the Kurds.

They have their toys, but in both continents, it&#039;s either socialist extra-efficency mood-kill bullshit, migrant and terrorism issues, or horrible crime, mental health issues, and corrupt as fuck governments even more so then our little puppet goverment.<br><br>Basically, we&#039;ve got cons which make our country bad, defintiely, but think of it this way:<br><br>We&#039;ve got one of the best climates, no extremes, mostly just warm or cool, rarely unbareable unless you live in certain areas.<br><br>Our job climate is shit no doubting it, and our economy is going to be a hellhole for a few years, but even then with our economic security issues, you can still live a rather comfortable life if you work things out, the old dreams of home ownership are a pipe-dream for most, but rent is becoming rather cosy.<br><br>We&#039;ve got our issues in crime and drugs, but for the most part, I can speak from experience, living in the shittiest of the shitholes, you&#039;re still not vulnerable to getting harmed. Even if we had guns, it wouldn&#039;t make a difference, australian society is somewhat different to american society. We&#039;ve got sufficent mental and physical health centres, especially for citizens.

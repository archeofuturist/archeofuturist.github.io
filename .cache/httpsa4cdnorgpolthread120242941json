At the end of the conflict, the major Arab powers denyed oil exports to the western world powers for their support of Israel. This kicks off the 1973 Energy crisis and its effects are felt around the entire world thus ensures foreign meddling in Arab countries for decades to come. Meanwhile, Europe is caught between a rock and a hard place. If it does nothing it will eventually be force to play second fiddle to whoever comes out on top in the next century. So a plan is created. If Europe could unify it&#039;s economy and become allies with the Middle east, it could become a super power to rival that of the USA and Russia. Europe begins to form the EU the Euro-Arab Dialogue begins. To two world powers, the intentions are obvious.<br>So what do two major world superpowers say when they see this power move?<br>&quot;Not on my watch!&quot;<br>Flash forward several decades. China becomes a first world nation and has started to flex it&#039;s muscles, Russia has managed to stand itself up after the collapse of the USSR and become powerful again is a short period of time, while the EU has become more an economic superpower. The USA and Russia feel their influence on Europe beginning to slip.

Russia secures power in Ukraine and annexes Crymia and gain better access to the Black Sea. The EU, seeing an opportunity to build relations with the Arab world, is all for it. Egypt undergoes a military Coup while Libya falls into civil war followed by Syria. Europe opens its doors and the Migrant Crisis begins. Russia does nothing except forge closer relations with Iran and Turkey while the USA gets closer to Israel, Saudi Arabia and the UAE. They know this can only end with one winner. The Ultimate prize of domination of the European Market is at stake. Because a weaker Europe means a stronger America\/Russia.<br><br>And that brings us to the final act of this conflict is set in a country currently at the center of it all. Syria and it&#039;s Civil War, or at least as I call it,&quot;The Pipeline War&quot;.<br>There are two pipelines on the table in the middle east. The USA-Saudi backed pipeline runs from Qatar, up through Saudi Arabia, through Iraq and Syria, and finally through Turkey on it&#039;s way to Europe. The Russian Pipeline runs from Iran, through Syria, and finally through Turkey into Europe. Syria is the key country here and who ever wins here determines whose pipeline gets built.<br>We all know how the story goes. Arab Spring happens, planting the seeds of dissent in the Syrian populace. Israel along with Saudi-Arabia, backed by the USA nurture this dissent in an attempt to install a government more friendly to their interest. The USA and friends keep pushing and Syria falls into Civil War. Russia sweeps in, condemns what is going on, and backs Assad along with Iran while shipping in guns and money. The USA, along with Israel and Saudi Arabia, start funneling manpower, money and guns to the Rebels.","time":1491715083,"resto":120242941,"id":"JVPlszoU","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120243071,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)01:18:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"The end result of this conflict will go a long way to determine who is the dominant power in the coming century. If the Russian pipeline gets built. Europe is forced to buy oil almost exclusively from Russia and friends. Russia slowly gains dominance in Europe while the USA becomes increasingly isolated on the global stage. Or, the Saudi-American backed pipeline gets built, Europe&#039;s dependence on Russian oil is obliterated. Russia is forced to only sell oil to the eastern powers. All the money that would&#039;ve gone to Russia now goes to Saudi-Arabia and the United States who both end up making a killing. This all while the Migrant Crisis continues and Europe continues to weaken.<br><br>The EU is in a lose-lose situation while the USA and Russia are poised to gain dominance over Europe and by extension, the world. If they pick a side in the conflict, they effectively choose who rules over them in the coming century. The best outcome for Europe now is a swift end to the war. Since it would give them an excuse to stop accepting migrants and also a chance to run into the bombed cities of Syria and invest money in their reconstruction. That is, if the other major players don&#039;t do so first.<br><br>So when Trump, and by extension the USA, Launched 50 Tomahawks missiles at targets in Syria, he still is America First.

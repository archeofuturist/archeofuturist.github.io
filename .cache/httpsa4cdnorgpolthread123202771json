I think the amount of meat we&#039;re eating is sickening. When the Atlantic side of North America was first colonized, lobster was a poverty food; we ate lobster because it was easy to come by. Right now, if I had a paddle boat and 10 traps, I could probably haul enough lobster to feed my family for a week, if there were no commercial fishing boats out there. The cod population is really coming back. I think city life is the main problem, because it encourages the thinking that &quot;I created wealth by trading stocks and stapling papers together or flipping burgers&quot;. The producers (farmers, fishers, miners, etc) are all in the background getting stolen from the most. But I&#039;m not even allowed to catch lobster for my family; if they see me with a bag of a couple lobsters, and I&#039;m leaving the boat, then they can arrest me. I can fish for government money, as long as I have a fishing license, but I&#039;m not allowed to take home a couple lobsters for myself. That&#039;s retarded. It says a lot about our society. You might not feel this way, but I think the state should fucking die. If mass starvation occurs, then I hope it fucking happens, because it&#039;s not sustainable to keep a population of parasites alive.

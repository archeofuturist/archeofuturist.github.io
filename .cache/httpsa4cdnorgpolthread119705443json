I am surrounded by libs on all sides here so my talk of politics is always about how screwed up &quot;our&quot; party is. So many examples. Ginsberg not retiring is my favorite thing to get em thinking. Just ridiculous the way they just follow the narrative even if it&#039;s ping pong podesta. What a fucking weirdo. I really hope the White House isn&#039;t in chaos as much as it is starting to seem. They better get to the bottom of this shit in Syria too. I&#039;m a pretty firm supporter of Assad handling his own business.","time":1491455049,"resto":119705443,"id":"elPDTmyf","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119710154,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)01:29:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119705443\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119705443<\/a><br><br>They believed their own shit about demographics stopping a Rep president ever happening till the US fell to global trade unions.","time":1491456567,"resto":119705443,"id":"F7PZfYbW","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119711015,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)01:39:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119705443\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119705443<\/a><br>NOBEL PRIZE BITCHES","time":1491457179,"resto":119705443,"id":"X4O3EziG","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119711527,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)01:45:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119711015\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119711015<\/a><br>Shit you&#039;re right.

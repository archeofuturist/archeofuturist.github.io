I am surrounded by libs on all sides here so my talk of politics is always about how screwed up &quot;our&quot; party is. So many examples. Ginsberg not retiring is my favorite thing to get em thinking. Just ridiculous the way they just follow the narrative even if it&#039;s ping pong podesta. What a fucking weirdo. I really hope the White House isn&#039;t in chaos as much as it is starting to seem. They better get to the bottom of this shit in Syria too. I&#039;m a pretty firm supporter of Assad handling his own business.","time":1491455049,"resto":119705443,"id":"elPDTmyf","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

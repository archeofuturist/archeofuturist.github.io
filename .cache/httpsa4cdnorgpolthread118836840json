If you answered yes to any of those questions, you are a \u201cpotential terrorist\u201d according to official U.S. government documents. At one time, the term \u201cterrorist\u201d was used very narrowly. The government applied that label to people like Osama bin Laden and other Islamic jihadists. But now the Obama administration is removing all references to Islam from terror training materials, and instead the term \u201cterrorist\u201d is being applied to large groups of American citizens. And if you are a \u201cterrorist\u201d, that means that you have no rights and the government can treat you just like it treats the terrorists that are being held at Guantanamo Bay. So if you belong to a group of people that is now being referred to as \u201cpotential terrorists\u201d, please don\u2019t take it as a joke. The first step to persecuting any group of people is to demonize them.

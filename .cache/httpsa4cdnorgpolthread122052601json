Ford eventually agreed, and on September 8, 1974, he granted Nixon a &quot;full, free, and absolute pardon&quot;, which ended any possibility of an indictment. <\/span><br><br>This seems to be a misconception that keeps popping up, it was often seen in speculation about Obama pardoning Clinton or vice versa.","time":1492728987,"resto":122052601,"id":"J1dA0c+u","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":122058697,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)18:56:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122058585\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122058585<\/a><br>At least I&#039;m not a muzzie, Mohammed.","filename":"1464099429768","ext":".jpg","w":550,"h":439,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":99,"tim":1492728997547,"time":1492728997,"md5":"lSQtTYKKSxPuIh\/E+xK8uQ==","fsize":49655,"resto":122052601,"id":"FNkR4SAK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122058708,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)18:56:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122055752\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122055752<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;got to him<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;implying they didn&#039;t have him the whole time<\/span><br><br>Trump is old money, his family has been in cahoots with (((them))) for generations.","time":1492729001,"resto":122052601,"id":"0qcGdpTt","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122058745,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)18:57:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122058458\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122058458<\/a><br>Stop using &quot;US interest&quot; when you clearly mean the deep state.","time":1492729021,"resto":122052601,"id":"QuExa+7u","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122058806,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)18:57:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122053096\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122053096<\/a><br>He broke Hillarys election.","time":1492729054,"resto":122052601,"id":"4qXGpYKA","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122058824,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)18:57:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122058669\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122058669<\/a><br>Assange has already been charged.

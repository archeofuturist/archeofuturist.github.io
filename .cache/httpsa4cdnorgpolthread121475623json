We look at others to determine what to do. Social proof is so strong, that even fictional characters in books and movies that commit suicide, can influence the reader or viewer to commit suicide themselves. <br><br>What has this got to do with anything? <br><br>The latest story, i.e. &quot;the Cleveland Easter Massacre&quot;, is flooding the internet. On social media, there are videos of the murderer, speaking of his life, explaining why he did it, etc. He&#039;s a human being, the mind of many will be influenced by these videos, click whirr, the untrained mind will thus look to social proof, and seeing that the murderer is a human, sharing the same problems as many, he may even become &quot;liked&quot;, another psychological factor that influences the untrained. <br><br>Can we conclude that more people will follow his actions? If not directly, in a similar manner? Will murder rates rise in the following days?","filename":"nignog","ext":".jpg","w":531,"h":432,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":203,"tim":1492401308507,"time":1492401308,"md5":"Vc9gf6v8OTDOpTq9emv5UA==","fsize":37117,"resto":0,"id":"s+V\/Exbu","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"phillips-and-kenneth-bollen-reported-that-between","country_name":"United States","replies":3,"images":2,"unique_ips":4},{"no":121475843,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)23:57:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121475623\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121475623<\/a><br>These are the end days.<br><br>Stay safe friend.","time":1492401426,"resto":121475623,"id":"f\/pRZvt4","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121476098,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)23:59:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121475623\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121475623<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;hasn&#039;t read Understanding Media, a book written in the 1960s but which predicted this perfectly<\/span><br><br>This is the future -- no more big wars, but a whole lot of sudden, small-scale random death, at any place, at any time, all over the world.<br><br>I&#039;ll take it over guaranteed nuclear extinction.","filename":"1488504511129","ext":".jpg","w":569,"h":488,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":107,"tim":1492401581389,"time":1492401581,"md5":"sRG0BtX6SMGqZ+7qcNWsTQ==","fsize":148085,"resto":121475623,"id":"8wDssQLN","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121476210,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)00:00:35","name":"Anonymous","filename":"1492395879038","ext":".png","w":1000,"h":1000,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492401635560,"time":1492401635,"md5":"tp\/lA4syw3HyXCk\/9IzFzg==","fsize":61080,"resto":121475623,"id":"IFvAQQJ4","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

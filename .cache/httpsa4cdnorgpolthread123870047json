This was the immediate cause of the late rupture and present revolution. Jefferson, in his forecast, had anticipated this, as the &quot;rock upon which the old Union would split.&quot; He was right. What was conjecture with him, is now a realized fact. But whether he fully comprehended the great truth upon which that rock stood and stands, may be doubted. The prevailing ideas entertained by him and most of the leading statesmen at the time of the formation of the old Constitution were, that the enslavement of the African was in violation of the laws of nature; that it was wrong in principle, socially, morally and politically. It was an evil they knew not well how to deal with; but the general opinion of the men of that day was, that, somehow or other, in the order of Providence, the institution would be evanescent and pass away... Those ideas, however, were fundamentally wrong. They rested upon the assumption of the equality of races. This was an error. It was a sandy foundation, and the idea of a Government built upon it\u2014when the &quot;storm came and the wind blew, it fell.&quot;<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Our new government is founded upon exactly the opposite ideas; its foundations are laid, its cornerstone rests, upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery, subordination to the superior race, is his natural and normal condition. This, our new government, is the first, in the history of the world, based upon this great physical, philosophical, and moral truth.<\/span>","time":1493788785,"resto":123870047,"id":"JTr6QdJ7","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123876057,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)01:21:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123875930\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123875930<\/a><br><br>See the first one explains that the most immediate cause of secession was the disagreement over slavery. <br><br>The second excerpt explains that the most important and defining feature of their new government is that it is based on the truth that Negroes are inferior.","time":1493788872,"resto":123870047,"id":"JTr6QdJ7","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123876467,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)01:25:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123870047\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123870047<\/a><br>Bump","time":1493789127,"resto":123870047,"id":"raUXpgUz","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123877126,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)01:31:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123870047\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123870047<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;HAHAHA HOLY SHIT you FUCKER of butts ACTUALLTY DIDN&#039;T KNOW WHAT THE CIVIL WAR WAS ABOUT.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;1 post by this id<\/span><br><br>[insert spice]","time":1493789471,"resto":123870047,"id":"M+en2Uxt","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123878316,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)01:44:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123870047\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123870047<\/a><br><br>he doesn&#039;t know much about many things. that much is clear.","time":1493790297,"resto":123870047,"id":"Fv\/mgqRk","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

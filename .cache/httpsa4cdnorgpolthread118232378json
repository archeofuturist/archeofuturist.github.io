Back when we were cave dwellers, in hunter-gatherer times, we just died when we got too old. The nobler souls in fact consciously decided that they have become a burden on their tribe, and ventured out into the wilds to be reclaimed by nature. Many &quot;primitive&quot; societies, most notable Asians and American Indians, had a strong culture of honor. And they would commit suicide before they brought dishonor to their tribe by being a drain on it.<br><br><br>This whole &quot;I need to live, despite being unworthy of life&quot;-sentiment of old people grasping onto their useless lives is a symptom of being unfulfilled. If you had a fulfilled life, and you are at peace with yourself, then you have absolutely no problem with dying when you&#039;re old. It&#039;s only these modern humans, infatuated with money and material wealth over everything else, who want to stall their death as long as possible. Pathetic creatures lower than any animal.

The reason they are stretching out our current financial system is because they know we in for a new technological revolution. So why not get everything out of it as long as we can. No one has to pay anyone in the future. All the debt, it does not matter. That&#039;s why there is financial globalism. Match all the systems, so they can be replaced when needed. That&#039;s why there are central banks, to synchronize it all.<br><br>Why do you think we still have Keynesian economics when we could have Austrian? Do you think the people up high don&#039;t know Austrian economics is way better? But that would make certain parts of the world too rich as a whole, to a point they are no longer competitive. You can look at it as a game that has met his final boss. Everyone would be happy and that&#039;s not what they want, it is unsustainable. <br><br>We are in for a revolution like never before. Automation, AI, hyper intelligence, CRISPR, block-chain. And also, infinite free energy. And that my friends is the key to advancement. All this political crap will no longer matter, everyone&#039;s lives will become easier. The focus will be more on advancing in our solar system after this. This will also cause a large divide between stupid and smart. The smart will come together. The stupid will have all means to lead a joyful life, it&#039;ll be also easy in Africa, obviously, but they will not contribute to anything. Socialism will be exhausted, because when everything is at hand and certain people still don&#039;t see the picture, people will realise it&#039;s not about giving stuff to people but it&#039;s their attitude.

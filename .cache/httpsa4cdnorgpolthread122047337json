The issue is that a lot of &#039;anti-leftists&#039;, for lack of a better term, more or less miss that a lot of this stuff still is important. <br>Just since leftists constantly insist on climate change doesn&#039;t mean that this &#039;science&#039; is as fake as gender bullshit.<br>Just since leftists are looking to regulate stuff to keep us from fucking over our environment doesn&#039;t mean that the opposite is a good idea.<br><br>It&#039;s really an issue of how capitalism works, even though right-wingers hate to admit it. Capitalism is based on growth. More sales, more profits, etc. You don&#039;t profit if you don&#039;t sell anything, ergo the machine needs to keep on running. <br><br>No idea how we&#039;re going to solve the issue, though, unless people eventually settle for some sort of universal income once machines take everyone&#039;s job, and we still somehow manage to keep lazy niggers or other gibsmedats out. <br><br>On that note, The Unabomber Manifesto is well-worth a read. Some of his conclusions are flawed, but generally he&#039;s very precise and smart. It shows that he&#039;s a mathematician.","time":1492724346,"resto":122047337,"id":"C7pzATMO","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":122048689,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)17:41:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122048366\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122048366<\/a><br>Agreed.

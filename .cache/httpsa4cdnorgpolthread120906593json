A correct execution in these fast exercises is, however, not easy, and it is recommended, if there is enough time, to do the exercises slowly at first, before doing the exercises fast.

Exercises are changed qwuickly into another and commands are only given shortly and smartly. Depending on the character of the exercise and the total duration of the gymnastic, the exercises are to be repeated 4-6 times. The duration is to be 2-3 minutes in the beginning, especially since untrained Hitlerjungen are exhausted easily.

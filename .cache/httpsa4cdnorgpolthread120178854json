Each creature has DNA and will pass on its genes to its young. Most of the DNA controls behaviours and appearance, but some controls how their bodies respond to the various chemicals in the game.<br><br>The advanced science kit feature of the game allows the player to inject a range of chemicals into their creature. Some chemicals include: testosterone, cyanide, glucose, defibrillant (a pseudochemical used in place of a defibrillator), heavy metals, and ATP.<br><br>So while you&#039;re busy teaching these critters to survive, you must also worry about their behaviour and un-diagnosed medical conditions.

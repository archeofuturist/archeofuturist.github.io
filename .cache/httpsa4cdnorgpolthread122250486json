See what happened to fuck Somalia up is they overthrew their leader Barre in a civil war. But the rebels weren&#039;t very united, only fighting against a common enemy, and they immediatley started fighting each other afterwards. It turned the country into hell, with local warlords vying for power everywhere. <br><br>This is something I like to bring up when people say Assad must go, because the rebels in Somalia were just like the rebels in Syria now. <br><br>The country is stabilizing, however. And the north of the country declared independence immediatley when the shit started to hit the fan, and has been de facto independent ever since even though it has no international recognition. It&#039;s called Somaliland. And it has survived the shit really well with its infastructure intact and everything stable<br><br>The rest of the country though, that&#039;s where all of the shit Somalia is known for happened. It&#039;s stabilizing now though. There is an internationally backed central government at this point in time and it has taken control of all of the major cities in the south. Currently the biggest threat is Al Shabaab, which is an Al Qaeda branch in Yemen, but they&#039;re not as big as they used to be. And Somalia now is MUCH better off than they were 10 years ago<br><br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Templ<wbr>ate:Somali_Civil_War_detailed_map<br><br>Current situation","time":1492846353,"resto":122250486,"id":"VJiLu1ga","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122251602,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)03:39:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122251075\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122251075<\/a><br>Where is the nuclear waste?

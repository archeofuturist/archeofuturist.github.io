The law that outlawed abortion did not only do just that, but rather contained several different decrees. The official title of the law was, \u201cDecree on the Prohibition of Abortions, the Improvement of Material Aid to Women in Childbirth, the Establishment of State Assistance to Parents of Large Families, and the Extension of the Network of Lying-in Homes, Nursery schools and Kindergartens, the Tightening-up of Criminal Punishment for the Non-payment of Alimony, and on Certain Modifications in Divorce Legislation.\u201d All of this was part of Stalin\u2019s initiative to encourage population growth, as well as place a stronger emphasis on the importance of the family unit to communism.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;When Stalin came to power, homosexuality became a topic unfit for public depiction, defense or discussion. Homosexual or bisexual Russians who wanted a position within the Communist Party were expected to marry a person of the opposite sex, regardless of their actual sexual orientation. A notable example was the Russian film director Sergei Eisenstein, who despite his homosexuality managed to survive by leading a double life, having affairs with men while married to a woman, producing films that were politically pleasing to Stalin.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The Nazi attack on the Soviet Union in 1941 induced Stalin to enlist the Russian Orthodox Church as an ally to arouse Russian patriotism against foreign aggression. Russian Orthodox religious life experienced a revival: thousands of churches were reopened; there were 22,000 by the time Nikita Khrushchev came to power. The regime permitted religious publications, and church membership grew.<\/span><br><br>BASED joe.","filename":"Stalinatthehelm","ext":".jpg","w":448,"h":306,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":85,"tim":1492395344710,"time":1492395344,"md5":"ECsL1nsfGStqCprMlKjiqQ==","fsize":40037,"resto":121456054,"id":"M5MDtYQV","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121463151,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)22:16:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121462338\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121462338<\/a><br>Irony, is that you had more Ethnic quality writers.<br>Middle-Class commissioning twats today just want to tick a box.","time":1492395365,"resto":121456054,"id":"lFpj1CPY","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121463221,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)22:16:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121463063\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121463063<\/a><br>Yes.

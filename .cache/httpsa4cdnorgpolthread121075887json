I cant begin to start at how it&#039;s time theft, it&#039;s lying, it&#039;s also putting your partner at risk for STDs, it&#039;s most likely if not a legal breach of the (modern cucked) marriage contract then certainly a breach of the spirit of that contract.<br>shit, this should be seen 100% morally wrong even if it&#039;s just for cheating on your GIRLFRIEND or boyfriend. Wife\/husband... still only 54% is a travesty.","time":1492185871,"resto":121075887,"id":"bKnbbdUn","country":"AT","country_name":"Austria"},{"no":121077829,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)12:12:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121076949\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121076949<\/a><br>You said it better.

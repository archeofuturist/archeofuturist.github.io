No shit, biggest fucking suplhur crested cocky you&#039;ve ever seen just comes blasting into the window, instacrack again. Aye LMFAO.

Great evening, couple of beers - another group of campers couple of hundred of meters away. Pretty chill just like us. Few more beers, then hit the swag.<br><br>3am. Nick the Greek arrives.

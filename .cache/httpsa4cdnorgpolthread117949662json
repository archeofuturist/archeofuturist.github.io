The Navy did many tests with several marine mammals to determine which would be best for the jobs they needed done. &quot;More than 19 species were tested, including some sharks and birds.&quot; Eventually, the bottlenose dolphin and California sea lion were shown to be the best at what the Navy needed them for. The bottlenose dolphins&#039; asset was their highly evolved biosonar, helping to find underwater mines, and the sea lions&#039; asset was their impeccable underwater vision, which can help to detect enemy swimmers. In fiscal year 2007, the United States Navy spent $14 million on research on marine mammals as weapons and marine mammal training programs in object recovery and mine detection and have 75 trained dolphins.[8] Dolphins have contributed to saving more lives in open water than specially trained life savers","time":1490287703,"resto":117949662,"id":"tEVXbcm8","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117952229,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)12:50:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117950953\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117950953<\/a><br>Now.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In his memoir on life as a Navy SEAL, Brandon Webb writes about a training exercise in San Diego to evade enemy military dolphins.

Hitler didn&#039;t have that, he just had his regular tier populism. I&#039;m quite sure Napoleon will have been hated with the same degree of ferocity and intensity in 1805 England as Hitler is in our society, but you get cucks giving Napoleon a pass due to their hatred of monarchy. Hitler wasn&#039;t destroying anything, he was building things up.","time":1491028906,"resto":119154410,"id":"bOwChmOu","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119155311,"now":"04\/01\/17(Sat)02:43:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"Napoleon&#039;s effect on the media","filename":"Screenshot-2017-04-01-07-42-36","ext":".png","w":527,"h":435,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":103,"tim":1491028990577,"time":1491028990,"md5":"U1PHgE29L3XzZq5AT686zQ==","fsize":293847,"resto":119154410,"id":"bOwChmOu","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"}]}

Hitler didn&#039;t have that, he just had his regular tier populism. I&#039;m quite sure Napoleon will have been hated with the same degree of ferocity and intensity in 1805 England as Hitler is in our society, but you get cucks giving Napoleon a pass due to their hatred of monarchy. Hitler wasn&#039;t destroying anything, he was building things up.","time":1491028906,"resto":119154410,"id":"bOwChmOu","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119155311,"now":"04\/01\/17(Sat)02:43:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"Napoleon&#039;s effect on the media","filename":"Screenshot-2017-04-01-07-42-36","ext":".png","w":527,"h":435,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":103,"tim":1491028990577,"time":1491028990,"md5":"U1PHgE29L3XzZq5AT686zQ==","fsize":293847,"resto":119154410,"id":"bOwChmOu","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119157975,"now":"04\/01\/17(Sat)03:23:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119155199\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119155199<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Napoleon had fixed himself to the ideology of the Revolution though<\/span><br><br>He betrayed the Revolution and made himself an absolute ruler, that&#039;s why the french bourgeoisie let him fall without much opposition after conquering Spain, because it wasn&#039;t about sacralizing private property and abolishing feudalism anymore but about creating an universal monarchy.<br><br><a href=\"#p119154410\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119154410<\/a><br>Napol\u00e9on hit our demography pretty bad but Hitler literally bled his own people to the last drop.<br>When Bonaparte returned in 1815 during the 100 days he had an almost fanatical support from the pleb and despite Waterloo he could have keep fighting during years but from his own word he didn&#039;t want to be the &quot;king of a jacquerie&quot; and instead of throwing back France into 1789 all over again he decided to let it go.<br><br>Also he didn&#039;t held concept like the inferiority of slavs or the Lebensraum, Napoleon was a conqueror in the classical sense, he didn&#039;t have the ideological fanaticism of Hitler.","time":1491031418,"resto":119154410,"id":"zxEXyaCZ","country":"FR","country_name":"France"}]}

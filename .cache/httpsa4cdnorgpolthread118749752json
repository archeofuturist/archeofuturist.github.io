The world sort of slows down as Americans go through an election. This is not a knock on the rest of the world, this is just fact.

People stop hating Trump because everyday life creeps up on them and they have other shit going on that ultimately takes over their attention span. And as long as Trump doesn&#039;t do anything REMOTELY beyond the pale (by his standards), he gets normalized. Which will make it twice as hard, if he loses in 2020\/2024, to undo everything he&#039;s done. <br><br>As it stands, most Democrats believe if they don&#039;t get Trump impeached by 2018, they are fucked. Even if they do reclaim the House, they know the GOP will rally around Trump simply to protect the GOP brand for 2020. And since the 2018 math makes it outright impossible for the Democrats to reclaim the Senate and the necessary 2\/3rds majority needed to convict, impeaching Trump in the House would be a futile gesture. The Pelosis and the Schumers NEED the impeachment to happen at the hands of the GOP, because it&#039;s the only way they can kill Ceaser without facing the consequences. <br><br>I also can not stress hard enough, Obama&#039;s role in the media onslaught. His bitterness is beyond belief, to the point that his trip to the islands without his family is partly due to Michelle being sick and tired of his Trump derangement syndrome. Obama made a lot of promises to Michelle; them traveling and doing all sort of married stuff and taking off from politics for at least 2-3 years.

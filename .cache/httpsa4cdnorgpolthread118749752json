And these &quot;bloggers&quot; and &quot;newbs&quot; as you like to call them, fell into the same trap that many vets even fall into and forget every four years). The world sort of slows down as Americans go through an election. This is not a knock on the rest of the world, this is just fact. Every four years, the biggest fall\/winter news story in the world is the election of the American President. This year, despite what they insist with things like the inauguration story, etc., was a very, very, very big year.<br><br>So, right now, not only are we coming out of winter time where news around the world naturally slows down a bit, but there was an American election that absolutely dominated the news cycle. Dominated. Everyone waiting to see the next move, the next thing said, the next whatever. Hanging on every bit.<br><br>Now they&#039;re facing a bit of an issue. As the weather starts to warm and the world begins to move on from the election, real problems will start to surface. Summer months are far more active than winter months. Whether it&#039;s geopolitics, gang violence, big festivals, sporting events, construction, just life in general, people go do more stuff.<br><br>Right now, they&#039;re covering fluff (they know it, even if they&#039;d never admit). To make it through the hibernation. They&#039;e keeping stories afloat without much there because, essentially, they&#039;re riding a bender like an addict. Have you ever seen someone have a long night on cocaine? Where it&#039;s 3:30 in the morning, everyone has gone home to bed, but they&#039;re still calling or hunting for more cocaine? It&#039;s a bit like that.<br><br>They&#039;re about to be forced to cover more important stories. The Trump presidency will settle in. Everyone in politics right now (not in media, I mean) are, essentially, doing the best they can and waiting for this all to blow over.","time":1490765022,"resto":118749752,"id":"sN3nNvk0","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118751784,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)01:24:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118751328\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118751328<\/a><br>Who is the Rothschild?","time":1490765098,"resto":118749752,"id":"o9Fv3erK","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":118751873,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)01:26:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118751328\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118751328<\/a><br>Ssshhh!

The world sort of slows down as Americans go through an election. This is not a knock on the rest of the world, this is just fact.

People stop hating Trump because everyday life creeps up on them and they have other shit going on that ultimately takes over their attention span. And as long as Trump doesn&#039;t do anything REMOTELY beyond the pale (by his standards), he gets normalized. Which will make it twice as hard, if he loses in 2020\/2024, to undo everything he&#039;s done. <br><br>As it stands, most Democrats believe if they don&#039;t get Trump impeached by 2018, they are fucked. Even if they do reclaim the House, they know the GOP will rally around Trump simply to protect the GOP brand for 2020. And since the 2018 math makes it outright impossible for the Democrats to reclaim the Senate and the necessary 2\/3rds majority needed to convict, impeaching Trump in the House would be a futile gesture. The Pelosis and the Schumers NEED the impeachment to happen at the hands of the GOP, because it&#039;s the only way they can kill Ceaser without facing the consequences. <br><br>I also can not stress hard enough, Obama&#039;s role in the media onslaught. His bitterness is beyond belief, to the point that his trip to the islands without his family is partly due to Michelle being sick and tired of his Trump derangement syndrome. Obama made a lot of promises to Michelle; them traveling and doing all sort of married stuff and taking off from politics for at least 2-3 years.

Makes it easier for a massive number of articles to be written when they&#039;re mostly based on what you came across on twitter or facebook, but a consequence of doing that is that they&#039;re basing their articles on often poorly worded posts which have no fact checking involved. <br><br>There&#039;s also the fact that no journalists get in trouble for misleading readers and anyone that has been posting on the internet for a while will know it&#039;s incredibly easy to mislead someone with some half truths. So since journalists are often very poorly paid, they instead need satisfaction from other places like by acting on their personal vendettas by writing piece after piece slamming people or trying to win good boy points with their friends.","time":1490771748,"resto":118749752,"id":"X6fkzKVu","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118759888,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)03:16:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118750874\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118750874<\/a><br><a href=\"#p118759585\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118759585<\/a><br><br>[X] Trump should be impeached because he is not doing what he promised<br>[X] Trump should be impeached because is doing the awful things he promised<br><br>PICK ONE YOU BRAINWASHED CRAZIES","filename":"orwell_1984","ext":".jpg","w":303,"h":271,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":111,"tim":1490771816586,"time":1490771816,"md5":"HLZMzhlZ9QbtBmMZh0Ii6w==","fsize":21892,"resto":118749752,"id":"3Qhu4v0n","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118759931,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)03:17:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118753948\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118753948<\/a><br>He&#039;s a pedowood producer","time":1490771865,"resto":118749752,"id":"oLPm29qw","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118760440,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)03:26:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118756106\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118756106<\/a><br>ffmpeg","time":1490772366,"resto":118749752,"id":"1MXyd8D1","country":"AT","country_name":"Austria"},{"no":118760847,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)03:32:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118753308\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118753308<\/a><br>He&#039;s also not a woman","time":1490772762,"resto":118749752,"id":"1vr6O6e4","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118760889,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)03:33:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118749752\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118749752<\/a><br>Spreading lies and disinfo all day everyday surely must be exhausting, considering that for 8 years all they did was delivering the pre-packaged lies given to them by Obongo and then spend the rest of the time praising him and his baboon wife.","filename":"1366062737247","ext":".jpg","w":799,"h":589,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":92,"tim":1490772805507,"time":1490772805,"md5":"o4+8b0GHOYaQzRtR4ln47w==","fsize":312829,"resto":118749752,"id":"PdpmYrqv","country":"IT","country_name":"Italy"},{"no":118761285,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)03:40:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118759888\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118759888<\/a><br>Praise Based Lord KEK!","filename":"888","ext":".jpg","w":450,"h":350,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":97,"tim":1490773207102,"time":1490773207,"md5":"lY2scpiNRS0AE3+eb53KnQ==","fsize":21518,"resto":118749752,"id":"3Qhu4v0n","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118761839,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)03:48:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118754420\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118754420<\/a><br>VG literally had this in the newspaper headlines yesterday.<br>FUCK OFF SHILL<br>U<br>C<br>K<br><br>O<br>F<br>F<br><br>S<br>H<br>I<br>L<br>L","time":1490773712,"resto":118749752,"id":"PJfO5z9I","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":118763298,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)04:11:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118754632\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118754632<\/a><br>Tricky cunt.","time":1490775097,"resto":118749752,"id":"DFdO41wS","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":118763550,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)04:15:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118752186\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118752186<\/a><br>If you dissent your post gets 0 replies.","time":1490775314,"resto":118749752,"id":"oYHhpI+b","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":118763685,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)04:17:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118757697\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118757697<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;He could&#039;ve gone into retirement as Donald &quot;You&#039;re Fired!&quot; Trump, wacky billionaire TV star.<\/span><br>Billionaires don&#039;t fucking retire, you cretin.

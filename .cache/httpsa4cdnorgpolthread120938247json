So embarrassed. I don&#039;t even have the strength to care anymore. I used to read the papers several times a day. I had my hopes up.

I don&#039;t give a shit about politics nor the news. Sweden is so cucked to the limit now that even our oldest friends wants to build walls around us. I guess they are starting to realize the severity of the brain damage epidemic we seem to have here. Not even a truck to the head could wake the Swede up (hue).<br><br>What a tragedy this is.

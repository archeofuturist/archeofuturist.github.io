All you describing is protecting from sites, but not from ISP.","time":1492461170,"resto":121554419,"id":"C6JXgR8F","country":"SI","country_name":"Slovenia"},{"no":121577452,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)16:33:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121577126\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121577126<\/a><br>Wrong <br>People still use Windows 10 because they don&#039;t give a shit<br>Snowden proved that a long time ago","time":1492461222,"resto":121554419,"id":"FHifTjHs","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121577486,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)16:33:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121577026\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121577026<\/a><br>Firefox always crashes for me now.<br><br>How much nicer is Opera?","time":1492461237,"resto":121554419,"id":"O5HB1Zjx","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121577511,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)16:34:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"We all remember who now works for BigG, right?","filename":"literally who seriously","ext":".jpg","w":220,"h":284,"tn_w":96,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492461246130,"time":1492461246,"md5":"RAOTdMM2sUSXXXsnI0gycw==","fsize":9828,"resto":121554419,"id":"TQaOQ2Gb","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121577625,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)16:34:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"this has all the answers:<br>https:\/\/vimeo.com\/210862415","time":1492461296,"resto":121554419,"id":"FhhBSlgp","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121577634,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)16:34:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121554419\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121554419<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;tfw the 6.5\/10 HR lady knows all of your fetishes<\/span><br>L-lewd.","time":1492461298,"resto":121554419,"id":"NvfJskwF","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121577818,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)16:36:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121577486\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121577486<\/a><br><br>Give it a shot.

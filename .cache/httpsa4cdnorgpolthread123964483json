What she said was &#039;Have a nice day Sir&#039; and he (she) got riled and complained to the manager. I saw the dude (he-she) in person, and the young girl was clearly right in identifying her as a dude. Wearing a shirt\/bow tie, trousers. A high and tight hair cut, and the hint of a 5 oclock shadow. Without a doubt looked like a dude. <br><br>So being a big company in the public eye, they don&#039;t want this on the news, and so she has been made to take courses on gender political correctness, among other shit, I&#039;m not quite sure... since she&#039;s not in my department. <br><br>I thought I&#039;d have a few years yet before that shit started hitting my industry, but alas, soon we&#039;ll have gender neutral toilets and no male officers on board ships. <br><br>Anyway \/pol\/, to get to my point. What do you say to someone instead of Sir\/Madam to keep you safe? Have the leftists made a gender neutral &#039;in person&#039; term for themselves? There isn&#039;t anything, is there? I have a sound job, and I don&#039;t want a stain on my resume like that. You would probably never get a job again in this industry if someone knew that shit.","filename":"1492951507176","ext":".jpg","w":2400,"h":3600,"tn_w":166,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493845747186,"time":1493845747,"md5":"4Xsnkw3\/mBUOiW05E9rzFw==","fsize":1416905,"resto":0,"id":"PFXTRPHi","country":"GB","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"i-work-in-a-place-where-i-have-to-be-politically","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":2,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":123965194,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)17:14:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"Get a new job with less fags","time":1493846045,"resto":123964483,"id":"FeWWmR0X","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123965311,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)17:14:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123964483\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123964483<\/a><br>fuck off back to plebit you piece of shit, this isnt a place to rollplay we are dead serius with what we discuss in here","time":1493846091,"resto":123964483,"id":"sq6AqZnM","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"}]}

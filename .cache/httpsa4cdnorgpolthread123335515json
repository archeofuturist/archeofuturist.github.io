Even though AIPAC does not have American interests in mind. <br><br>SPD is basically a Likud proxy anyway. They fund Antifa and use Israeli funding to subvert German natsoc groups. This is just one of these instances where pandering to Germany&#039;s anti-German leftists came with a price of stepping on the toes of the master. But SPD is no more anti-Israel than establishment Republicans are pro-free markets or anti-war.","time":1493480234,"resto":123335515,"id":"\/MIqSmQ4","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123344335,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)11:37:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123344098\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123344098<\/a><br>It is wrong.

This is the only existing species of the genus Myobatrachus and can only be found between Geraldton and Fitzgerald River in the Perth region of Western Australia. Not only does it have human-like skin and face... this creature has no tadpole stage and emerges from an egg as a fully formed frog. This is the missing link between amphibians and terrestrials; finally free from the nurturing aquatic habitat. This frog is a symbol for independence from socialist and communist ways of an aquatic habitat, wretched with its primitive and limiting conditions that dooms life for depending on global fresh water supplies. Find this frog and bring it to the Temple of Amun-Ree to the high priest Haremakhek. A frog must be taken before April 22nd when Lyrids and Eta Aquarids meteoroid storms will commence. Move swiftly now, fullfill your destiny, heed the call of the prophet.","filename":"tileshop","ext":".jpg","w":800,"h":545,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":170,"tim":1492470339838,"time":1492470339,"md5":"fho\/plzIIpHCJyjsMan1wQ==","fsize":78655,"resto":0,"id":"G9mVPANM","country":"MX","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-incarnation-of-kek-in-a-human-body","country_name":"Mexico","replies":4,"images":1,"unique_ips":5},{"no":121599866,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)19:17:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121598261\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121598261<\/a>","filename":"IMG_0062","ext":".jpg","w":236,"h":236,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492471078299,"time":1492471078,"md5":"t5WT1z9YmlceQIuQLif0mg==","fsize":23672,"resto":121598261,"id":"OTbwiACN","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121600263,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)19:20:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121598261\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121598261<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;high priest Haremakhek<\/span><br><br>That and an Aussie are the only missing ingredient.","time":1492471252,"resto":121598261,"id":"5R7OboQG","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121600394,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)19:22:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121598261\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121598261<\/a><br>looks like a naked turtle","time":1492471320,"resto":121598261,"id":"4J+2p5UV","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":121600898,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)19:25:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"Frog turtle how do we get (((them))) to name the only species Pepe?","time":1492471546,"resto":121598261,"id":"+8zFwEHl","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

It probably some sort of reference to pervertariat activity that involves &quot;tucking&quot;. I remember working in poconos in the summer of 1995 in a remote resort as international exchange student. The nearby small shabby hotel few miles down the road had entire weekend booked by this group of men who were part of some sort of organization as depicted in movies such as The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert, To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar, Some Like It Hot, Tootsie, Mrs Doubtfire, etc.. etc<br>There was lithuanian guy (at least thats the story) working in that place as waiter so he told me about it. He said those men were cool guests - performed some sort of pageants, dressing up games, many of them were with wives (he didn&#039;t mention anything about &quot;call me caitlyns&quot;). He couldn&#039;t say a single bad thing about this experience with those CIA homos playing dressup games. <br>At the same time I remember working in NYC west side restaurant and one night there was this couple who late at night walked in for something. So they were both males, but one was dressed as &quot;call me caitlyn&quot;. Another looked like someone who is &quot;holding his hand&quot; throughout the dangerous experience. You could say a shrink, a spook doesn&#039;t matter. He looked very grotesque. He was suffering immensely. Obviously he was &quot;exploring&quot; something about labeling theory, symbolic interactionism, looking glass self and similar concepts. Nothing was working for him. So he was some sort of pokemon on the road to rainbow slaughterhouse suicide squad.","time":1493026958,"resto":122566583,"id":"pa91KZHm","country":"LT","country_name":"Lithuania"},{"no":122568348,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)05:44:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122566583\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122566583<\/a><br>He spits hot fire fuck bill O","time":1493027080,"resto":122566583,"id":"a7+TtwmD","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122568363,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)05:44:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"Yeah Tucker used to do early weekend shows and basically appeared whenever asked.<br><br>Pretty crazy.

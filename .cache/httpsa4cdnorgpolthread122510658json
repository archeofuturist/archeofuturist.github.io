I&#039;ll give a <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;quick rundown <\/span><br>Basically it&#039;s an argument with three possible scenarios:<br>1. Human civilization is unlikely to reach a level of technological maturity capable of producing simulated realities, or such simulations are physically impossible to construct.<br>2. A comparable civilization reaching aforementioned technological status will likely not produce a significant number of simulated realities (one that might push the probable existence of digital entities beyond the probable number of &quot;real&quot; entities in a Universe) for any of a number of reasons, such as, diversion of computational processing power for other tasks, ethical considerations of holding entities captive in simulated realities, etc.<br>3. Any entities with our general set of experiences are almost certainly living in a simulation.","filename":"image","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":720,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1492991554260,"time":1492991554,"md5":"cR9vK2IQvym13J5fh4Qg5g==","fsize":159102,"resto":0,"id":"ykq4ddlY","country":"DK","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"real-life-matrix","country_name":"Denmark","replies":2,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":122511249,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)19:56:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122510658\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122510658<\/a><br>DUDE WEED","time":1492991802,"resto":122510658,"id":"Yy9qtKxK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122511702,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)20:00:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122511249\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122511249<\/a><br>Come on, play with the idea for a moment.

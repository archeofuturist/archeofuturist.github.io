The reason is because the delayed choice quantum erasure experiment has essentially proven that oberving reality changes it, and that at this point in our research there is no basis for thinking that there is a material reality outside of what is observed. It&#039;s not that we&#039;re in a computer simulation, it&#039;s that the universe is being simulated inside Gods mind and consciousness is fundamental for reality.","time":1492994060,"resto":122510658,"id":"4ExCEnyg","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122516166,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)20:36:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122510658\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122510658<\/a><br>Is this the birth of a new meme?","time":1492994162,"resto":122510658,"id":"SfSI9LbH","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":122516196,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)20:36:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;there&#039;s one in billions chance we&#039;re in base reality<\/span><br><br>But one in one chance we&#039;re in based reality.

I think it is very possible that we are existing in a simulation, but I am not smart enough to offer anything resembling proof or even a probability. What I do believe is that every piece of data each individual knows about their reality is filtered through their brain\/processor so an individual&#039;s reality could only exist from their perspective, kind of like an FPS. It doesn&#039;t have any practical value, but it is quite interesting to think about, and to me makes it easier to accept that I don&#039;t understand the reality I live in and that science&#039;s answers may not actually accurately describe my\/our environment. I&#039;d never push this idea on anyone, but I enjoy considering it. I also enjoy thinking about the idea that The Matrix is a sensationalized version of this potential truth and that was exposed to us as fiction to make it seem like anyone who truly believes in simulation theory as a loon who believes in something that is obviously fictional. Again, no practical value and I could be bats but meh, reality at face value as I have experienced it has been kind of boring. Maybe I need to get out and experience more, but I&#039;m pretty comfy.","time":1492994498,"resto":122510658,"id":"AxjXO08L","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122516828,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)20:41:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"premise 1 is unreasonable.","time":1492994514,"resto":122510658,"id":"1vOatfEv","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122516856,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)20:42:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122515280\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122515280<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;If there is knowledge to be gained then why not make a more simple simulation than creating an entire universe and all the living beings that go into it?<\/span><br><br>Who says the simulators hand crafted everything?

A computational matrix has to have some basis on reality; that is, each &quot;thing&quot; being simulated must be stored along with pertinent information by some body in reality. The fundamental bits that make up a simulated universe would require, at the very highest level of sophistication, at least one of whatever the fundamental bits of put universe is to mark it&#039;s existence ( as well as likely many others to store pertinent variables). Since we can only access our own galaxy in the foreseeable future due to special relativity, we will only be able to create a universe of complexity a fraction of ours EVEN IF WE REPRESENT ALL BODIES IN THE UNIVERSE IN THE MOST EFFICIENT WAY POSSIBLE. Practically, the simulstions we are capable of making will likely be far, far less complex.

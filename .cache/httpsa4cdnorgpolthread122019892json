Trump claimed Curiel could not impartially hear the case because of his background and Trump&#039;s hardline immigration policies. The case was eventually settled.<br><br>Now, Curiel is assigned to hear the case of Juan Manuel Montes Bojorquez, 23, who his lawyers allege was deported from California to Mexico earlier this year despite having active protection under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, also known as DACA.<br>And Trump&#039;s comments toward Curiel last year -- he called the Indiana-born judge a &quot;hater&quot; and a &quot;Mexican&quot; -- drew some of the loudest accusations of racism that the then-candidate faced during his campaign and several repudiations from prominent Republicans.<br><br>Lawyers for Montes say their client was apprehended by Border Patrol and deported on February 18. DHS said Wednesday that never happened.<br>While DHS initially said Tuesday they had a record of Montes&#039; DACA status expiring in 2015, they released further information Wednesday saying he did, in fact, have DACA status until 2018, agreeing with lawyers for Montes.<br><br>They really buried this paragraph:<br><br>The problem, though, is on the part of the story both sides agree on: Montes tried to sneak back into the US on February 19 and was caught by Border Patrol. DACA requires individuals to get pre-clearance to leave the country, and so Montes&#039; re-entry then showed he had left without authorization and voided his status, DHS said. He was sent back to Mexico the following day, where he is now staying.","filename":"GonzaloCuriel","ext":".jpg","w":667,"h":1000,"tn_w":166,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492710813729,"time":1492710813,"md5":"wcrvQudUPIOXpx64vmHnng==","fsize":50330,"resto":0,"id":"MwHtVFtD","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"our-old-friend-gonzalo-curiel-to-hear-case-of","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":2,"unique_ips":3},{"no":122020308,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)13:57:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122019892\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122019892<\/a><br>Looks like Montes wasn&#039;t the dindu good boy after all!","filename":"bog boyz","ext":".png","w":473,"h":379,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":100,"tim":1492711067261,"time":1492711067,"md5":"oheut06UdkB\/8G4bA28yFw==","fsize":224986,"resto":122019892,"id":"3ICX22jz","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122022062,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)14:14:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122019892\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122019892<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;his background<\/span><br><br>Judenpresse will never tell that truth.

Australia<br><br>2. This comic fucking ignores millions of years of Human evolution as hunter gatherers. In ancient times women were a valuable resource to a tribe. You did not expose them to danger and risk losing a womb or mother to physical death by accident. Mortality rates were much higher as well. If a fucking Bear or Wolf or Lion or other tribe didn&#039;t kill you, sickness probably would. Women have never protected and defended territory from danger or outsiders in their entire evolutionary history, now they want to be politicians and allow people from another tribe into the home country due to some perverted maternal instinct.<br><br>Education was very expensive, slow, and books were hard to come by. Educating a female was a complete waste of time, money, and energy when it would make much more sense to send the boy off to school to earn money while the woman raised as many children as possible to survive the black fucking plague.<br><br>Women need to learn history and shut the fuck up.","time":1493741093,"resto":123777644,"id":"qPck4PKn","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123782096,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)12:06:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123777644\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123777644<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;male child brides<\/span><br>this doesn&#039;t make even a remote amount of sense from a reproductive standpoint, or any standpoint<br><br>also why does the oppression get to start in post industrial times","time":1493741200,"resto":123777644,"id":"PvYxUg8y","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123782333,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)12:08:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;People having societal roles is oppression<\/span>","time":1493741337,"resto":123777644,"id":"1ZzEoXRH","country":"AR","country_name":"Argentina"},{"no":123782483,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)12:10:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123780783\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123780783<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; need a massive police state<\/span><br>already there anon","filename":"4863160881758","ext":".jpg","w":657,"h":527,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":100,"tim":1493741417785,"time":1493741417,"md5":"0PFjiM44Vd2JfnbRz9matg==","fsize":45839,"resto":123777644,"id":"oj73QSgh","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123782531,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)12:10:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123778874\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123778874<\/a><br>Asterix and Obelix is nice.","time":1493741441,"resto":123777644,"id":"1ZzEoXRH","country":"AR","country_name":"Argentina"},{"no":123782678,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)12:12:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123778874\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123778874<\/a><br>hey! don&#039;t forget about calvin and hobbes","filename":"61692b05f08049cfcfb0909327c69419[1]","ext":".gif","w":600,"h":190,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":39,"tim":1493741524276,"time":1493741524,"md5":"YWkrBfCASc\/PsJCTJ8aUGQ==","fsize":19033,"resto":123777644,"id":"0DJfV05s","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123782885,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)12:14:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123777644\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123777644<\/a><br>Shit, except for WGTOW panel","time":1493741651,"resto":123777644,"id":"Pms1n5e3","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":123783095,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)12:16:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123781367\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123781367<\/a><br>I didn&#039;t understand it in the context of the comic because it&#039;s a fantasy of &quot;role reversal&quot; yet they are disadvantaged by being in male roles?

Of that 74%, only 24% were convinced to vote for Macron, after a massive media campaign.<br><br>- With 74% of the voters voting &#039;anti-establishment&#039;, the endorsements of the leaders of the 2 major parties from last cycles can be framed negatively. Macron can be painted as establishment. His policies will aid to this, as he is infact establishment.<br><br>- Of the 74% &#039;anti-establishment&#039; vote, just under 20% went to M\u00e9lenchon. M\u00e9lenchon refused to endorse Macron, and his voters consist of people against the European Union, Trans-Atlantic Free Trade Agreement, and the EU-CAN Comprehensive Economic Trade Agreement. These things can be used against Macron, and for Le Pen.<br><br>- Of the 26% of &#039;establishment&#039; voters, 20% we for The Republicans. They are conservative. Just like Cruz\/Kasich voters in America, they will ultimately side with Le Pen in the end, despite having tries to move through their &#039;ideal&#039; candidate initially. The issues of immigration, taxes, and the anti-EU sentiment will be winning factors for Le Pen. Like Republicans in America, they will largely ignore the words of their partys leaders, and vote for security and sovereignty.<br><br><br>** Winning Topics<br><br>- Establishment vs Anti-Establishment<br>- Immigrations Security<br>- Jobs<br>- European Union opinions<br>- Trade Agreements<br>- Legislative Experience<br>- ETC<br><br>This election is ours!

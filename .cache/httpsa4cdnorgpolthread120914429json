The Daily Beast&#039;s recap of prepared remarks delivered by Sessions yesterday make him sound like a racist Bane cosplay enthusiast who learned everything he knows about messaging from studying one-dimensional movie villains:<br>\u201cThis is a new era,\u201d said Sessions, who sported a dark suit in the hot Arizona sun. \u201cThis is the Trump era.\u201d<br>Sessions made the announcement over a glitchy sound system to a group of reporters and Customs and Border Protection agents just a few feet away from the Mexico border. A gust of wind knocked over the American flag behind him as he spoke, so a CBP agent stood behind it and propped it up until the attorney general finished his speech.<br>One of the most significant takeaways from Tuesday&#039;s announcement is the revelation that his Department of Justice will ramp up its efforts to prosecute individuals suspected of &quot;transportation or harboring of aliens&quot;\u2014which could, in theory, include undocumented immigrants who house their own family members, or anyone who gives a ride to undocumented immigrants looking for work. A DOJ prosecutor interviewed by the Daily Beast, echoing the concerns of Department of Justice lawyers we spoke to before Sessions was even confirmed to his position, felt no need to mince words.<br>\u201cIt\u2019s fucking horrifying,\u201d the prosecutor said. \u201cIt\u2019s totally horrifying and we\u2019re all terrified about it, and we don\u2019t know what to do.&quot;<br><br><br>http:\/\/www.gq.com\/story\/jeff-sessio<wbr>ns-immigration-crackdown","filename":"GettyImages-647237574","ext":".jpg","w":800,"h":533,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1492093226938,"time":1492093226,"md5":"uCQ\/7pmVuyd6JMOcftNMdA==","fsize":81425,"resto":0,"id":"k6aDy8ri","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"attorney-general-jeff-sessions-is-using-his-job","country_name":"United States","replies":7,"images":0,"unique_ips":4},{"no":120914518,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)10:21:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"The Washington Post has more details on the efforts of Sessions\u2014a man who doesn&#039;t even believe in legal immigration\u2014to purge the country of people who don&#039;t look like him. The Customs and Border Patrol is spending $20 million of your taxpayer dollars to construct a border wall prototype and, along with Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, is opening up more than 33,000 beds for prospective detainees. Sessions is also chomping at the bit to sign more 287(g) agreements, which allow local police departments to enforce federal immigration law. These infamous programs not only gobble up valuable state and local tax dollars, but are also used with depressing frequency to justify unadorned racial profiling.<br>Before his Senate career, Jeff Sessions served for years as a U.S. attorney and a state attorney general, but his conduct in this new job demonstrates pretty clearly that he doesn&#039;t give a shit about &quot;justice.&quot; Rather, as none other than Steve Bannon asserted when asked about the crux of Sessions&#039; myopic worldview, the Attorney General sees the law as an expedient tool for molding his country into an ethno-nationalist utopia in which Muslims can&#039;t get in, police officers can do whatever the hell they want, and minorities are either afraid to vote or stripped of their ability to do so. According to the Beast&#039;s report, to Sessions, the heartbreaking human costs necessitated by his agenda are merely the price we pay to make America great again.","time":1492093283,"resto":120914429,"id":"k6aDy8ri","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120914551,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)10:21:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"\u201cWill there be any mercy or latitude in prosecuting people who have U.S.-born children who are minors here?\u201d one reporter asked.<br>Sessions didn\u2019t blink. \u201cWe want everybody to comply with the law,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd because a child or a family member enters the United States lawfully doesn\u2019t mean that others can enter the country unlawfully.

Are you aware of something known as the cartels and maras? They exploit and control entire regions. Their main income source is drug trade, but heavily supplement it by extortion of the local population. They bring about violence, since their market is so profitable. It&#039;s two fold as well, as this violence creates migrants: those that are trying to escape the violence and those that are escaping a poverty caused by milked dry\/killed business owners. The war on drugs has been a failure because there hasn&#039;t been one. <br>The people that migrate illegally are very often illiterate, and will have their spawn in your country. They will be called Americans, despite their heritage having contributed nothing to what the country is today. They will grow on government assistance, learning to depend on it to house, feed, and educate\/indoctrinate. This is a voter base. A voter base that will consistently seek to be sustained by their government. Government officials are happy to do so since it means more government. It&#039;s a cycle that will soon result in much more than some politician or lawmaker telling you what bathroom you can and can&#039;t use. All at the expense of the entrepreneur, the employed, the worker.

The money could instead be used to help those who contribute, and could instead be used in other social programs for American citizens, repairing infrastructure, or other uses that benefit the people that pay in.<br><br>Now I know you&#039;re thinking that some illegal immigrants pay taxes.

However, they do not make up for all of the illegal immigrants not paying taxes. <br><br>Keep in mind that that not all Americans are white. There are Americans of every race and creed. This hurts all taxpaying Americans. Legal immigrants have it even worse, considering that they made sacrifices to come through the system properly while others do not. They want everyone to play by the same rules as well. <br><br>Hopefully this will help you understand a little more. Remember, \/pol\/ is a compassionate board of peace.

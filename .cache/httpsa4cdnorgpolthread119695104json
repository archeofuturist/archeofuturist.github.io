I need you \/pol\/.<br>Lets get a hashtag trending tomorrow to show popular support of America NOT entering the Syrian Civil war, and hopefully reach the White House to let Trump know that his voters don&#039;t want America to nation build anymore.<br><br>#NoMorePointlessWars came from \/our girl\/ Ann Coulter, but I&#039;m open to something better. And I&#039;m thinking about starting at ~10-11AM EST. <br><br>Is this possible? Or is it too late, and should we plan for Friday? <br><br>I&#039;m not an expert in social media stuff, and I only helped a little bit last time, so I need you guys to help. I have some starter questions:<br>How do we get it trending? <br>How do we alert \/pol\/&#039;s twitter accounts? <br>How do we make reddit do the leg work?<br><br>ALSO:<br>Should we be trying to redpill normies on whats happening in Syria or just try to promote America not getting involved?

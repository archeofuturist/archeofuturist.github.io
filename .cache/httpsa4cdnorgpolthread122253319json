One of these myths is the myth of civic nationalism, and it is increasingly taken for granted by international commentators and policy-makers. It suggests that in western democracies, freely chosen principles have replaced cultural heritage as the basis of political solidarity. The way to preserve freedom and rationality in modern life is to persuade -- or force -- people to switch from ethnic to civic nationalism. If only, so the argument goes, we could persuade Serbians -- or Kosovars, or even the Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois -- to replace their visions of ethnic or cultural unity with our vision of civic solidarity, then nationalism need no longer promote ethnic violence and intolerance.&quot;","time":1492850684,"resto":122253319,"id":"sFYILrFt","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122255772,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)04:45:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122255203\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122255203<\/a><br>Cuck off","time":1492850750,"resto":122253319,"id":"sFYILrFt","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122255852,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)04:47:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122253319\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122253319<\/a><br>Why the fuck would you want to be a part of a soon to be majority shitskin country.

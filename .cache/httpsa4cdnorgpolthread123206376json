Thankfully, they had a fairly large supply of food, lots of defensible locations, and some of the greatest military minds of the era on their side. So, the North had to win the war through attrition. They did this by conquering the Mississippi and cutting off Western States in the Confederacy, Blockading the Eastern Coast and the Gulf of Mexico in the confederacy, destroying the few industrial sites the South had with Sherman&#039;s march to the sea, razing the Shenandoah Valley which supplied the Confederacy&#039;s main force (Lee&#039;s army), and lastly the Emancipation Proclamation. If the North depleted the South of its slaves, they had no food production. Through these methods, the South was worn down and forced to surrender at Appomattox Courthouse with no foreign aid or domestic supplies left.<br><br>Lincoln was prepared to send the slaves back to Africa, but he was assassinated before he could present the issue to Congress. Due to the more pressing matter of Souther Reconstruction, the Freedmen&#039;s Bureau was introduced as a placeholder and Jim Crow laws were introduced to repress the Freedmen. Instead of sending them back to Africa, they were suppressed and frustrated for multiple generations making the freedmen easy pawns of Jewish Schemes.","filename":"1493234867725","ext":".jpg","w":1200,"h":800,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1493396084108,"time":1493396084,"md5":"afdUIwZbkRLSktPJyT7I6g==","fsize":114716,"resto":123206376,"id":"yfzPKffr","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":123210921,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)12:15:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123210710\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123210710<\/a><br>muh prosperity through inflation <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;How small is too small?

I&#039;ve read hundreds over the years and very few were fighting for slavery. FACTS: MOST of the Union soldiers hated blacks and did NOT want the war to become a war about slavery (many threatened to desert, some did)-- their primary motivation was the draft. A decent number also were motivated by preserving the federal union and squashing the rebels. There were a handful of abolitionists, but they were hated by other Union soldiers and had to hide their identities. <br>MOST of the southern soldiers were primarily motivated by the thought that they were defending their farms and homeland. Most believed the federal government was overstepping it&#039;s narrowly constrained constitutional authority, so in that sense it was motivated by the balance of powers between the federal government and the states.","time":1493396345,"resto":123206376,"id":"LBjTw70K","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123211384,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)12:19:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123211210\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123211210<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;The Antebellum South tries to rule the country<\/span><br>What are you talking about<br>They wanted to leave","time":1493396399,"resto":123206376,"id":"mCC6mUY\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123211428,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)12:20:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123211301\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123211301<\/a><br>hey, that&#039;s a good post","time":1493396423,"resto":123206376,"id":"6PsRxajV","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123211468,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)12:20:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;muh Dixie Land<\/span>","time":1493396444,"resto":123206376,"id":"ejfLeksx","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123211483,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)12:20:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123210998\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123210998<\/a><br><br>Maybe Lincoln should have more publically stated his plan to send them back","time":1493396453,"resto":123206376,"id":"ldWOBXm8","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123211555,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)12:21:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123211301\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123211301<\/a><br>My ancestors owned slaves but they fought for the Union because Delaware was still a part of it","time":1493396491,"resto":123206376,"id":"mCC6mUY\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123211662,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)12:22:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123211483\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123211483<\/a><br>there&#039;s a secret document buried in a box in a warehouse on a base in a bunker<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;you have to go back. t- abe<\/span>","time":1493396546,"resto":123206376,"id":"6PsRxajV","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123211762,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)12:23:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123211483\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123211483<\/a><br><br>He did, it just came down to this:<br><br>Neither southerners nor northerners wanted niggers in their new home. <br><br>But as southerners were reliant on slaves for their agrarian culture, they needed them until they developed better technology. <br><br>The industrious northerners didn&#039;t need slaves anymore as much as southerners did.","time":1493396597,"resto":123206376,"id":"r763DJym","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123211821,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)12:23:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123211384\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123211384<\/a><br>No, faggot.

This cemented federal power and paved the way for the Gilded Age, Monopolies, Mass Third World Immigration to replenish the labor market, Globalism, Central Banking, the Military Industrial Complex, Corporatist Media, and other horrors of the Modern Plutocratic World. <br><br>That being said, the war did end up involving slaves&#039; rights because the North needed to win the war. Much to their chagrin as they needed to prove offensive capability to gain foreign support from Britain or France, the Confederate States of America were playing a very defensive game. Thankfully, they had a fairly large supply of food, lots of defensible locations, and some of the greatest military minds of the era on their side. So, the North had to win the war through attrition. They did this by conquering the Mississippi and cutting off Western States in the Confederacy, Blockading the Eastern Coast and the Gulf of Mexico in the confederacy, destroying the few industrial sites the South had with Sherman&#039;s march to the sea, razing the Shenandoah Valley which supplied the Confederacy&#039;s main force (Lee&#039;s army), and lastly the Emancipation Proclamation. If the North depleted the South of its slaves, they had no food production. Through these methods, the South was worn down and forced to surrender at Appomattox Courthouse with no foreign aid or domestic supplies left.<br><br>Lincoln was prepared to send the slaves back to Africa, but he was assassinated before he could present the issue to Congress. Due to the more pressing matter of Souther Reconstruction, the Freedmen&#039;s Bureau was introduced as a placeholder and Jim Crow laws were introduced to repress the Freedmen. Instead of sending them back to Africa, they were suppressed and frustrated for multiple generations making the freedmen easy pawns of Jewish Schemes.","filename":"1493234867725","ext":".jpg","w":1200,"h":800,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1493396084108,"time":1493396084,"md5":"afdUIwZbkRLSktPJyT7I6g==","fsize":114716,"resto":123206376,"id":"yfzPKffr","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"}]}

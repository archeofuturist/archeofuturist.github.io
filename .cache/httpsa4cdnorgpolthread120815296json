Not the refugee&#039;s guarantor SJWs!","com":"In 2013, the state government established a program that would allow Syrians who had been in Germany for a while to bring their families to the country as well - under the condition that they had proof of sufficient income to provide accommodation and food for their loved ones.<br><br>Since not all refugees who wanted to bring their families had this, Grothe, who is a psychiatrist in the city of Giessen, and roughly 30 other volunteers jumped in. They signed an agreement stating they&#039;d guarantee the state wouldn&#039;t have to pay for the refugee families coming to live in Germany.<br><br>Until recently, there was an ongoing discussion about whether obligations ended once the refugees that the guarantor cosigned for were granted asylum. That&#039;s what Hessen&#039;s interior ministry promised Klaus-Dieter Grothe and the other guarantors. But that&#039;s not how Germany&#039;s Federal Administrative Court decided in summer 2016.<br><br>Instead, the judges stated that guarantors who signed for refugees before the clarification was in place are accountable for three years after the family&#039;s arrival; everyone who becomes a guarantor after is accountable for five years, no matter the refugees&#039; asylum status.<br><br>Job centers in the Giessen area that have been paying benefits to refugees are making use of the updated ruling. Guarantors are now supposed to pay back the benefits refugees they have co-signed for are receiving.<br><br>Guarantors made to pay thousands of euros<br>&quot;Our interior ministry promised us that our responsibility would 100 percent end after the refugees were granted asylum here,&quot; Grothe said. &quot;Now the job centers are saying &#039;Your obligation is still in place and we want the money back that we paid for your refugees!&#039;&quot;","filename":"Screen Shot 2017-04-12 at 11.46.24 PM","ext":".png","w":1412,"h":1154,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":204,"tim":1492033766007,"time":1492033766,"md5":"OqKIuuG0FZ+fhRFr3z3UPw==","fsize":1486941,"resto":0,"id":"RRyw03iv","country":"DE","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"germany-no-not-the-refugees-guarantor-sjws","country_name":"Germany","replies":9,"images":0,"unique_ips":7},{"no":120815582,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)17:51:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"Good.","time":1492033873,"resto":120815296,"id":"6SqFqB8L","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":120815626,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)17:51:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;running out of other people&#039;s money<\/span><br>kek","time":1492033889,"resto":120815296,"id":"bjrn1H6C","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120815907,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)17:53:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120815296\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120815296<\/a><br>So my welfare gibs as a German citizen are safe?

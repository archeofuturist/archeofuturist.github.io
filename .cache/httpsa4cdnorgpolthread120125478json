It has everything to do with economics. Roads populated entirely of self-driving cars will carry a much higher capacity with a lower energy usage and almost no accidents.<br><br>Traffic lights, for instance, would not be strictly necessary. This means you don&#039;t need to expend energy to slow down the vehicle and then bring it back up to speed.

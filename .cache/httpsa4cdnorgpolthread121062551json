The mind has an instated craving to be &quot;filled&quot; by ever-new &quot;objects of attention&quot; which it discards as soon as they have become familiar. It exists in time and time, to satisfy it, must do what it cannot do, supply it with eternal &quot;novelty.&quot; &quot;The old peripatetic principle that Nature abhors a vacuum may be properly applied to the mind,&quot; but the vacuous mind, preying hungrily on experience, can never satisfy its concept of the mental vacuum is between this inherent need of the mind to be filled with &quot;objects of attention&quot; and the elusive nature of the objects offered it by temporal experience. The mind, surpassing its immediate experience, ultimately is beyond all possible earthly experience; for it operates on reality through acts of imagination that prevent it from staying with anything that is close at hand. The soul and the will are infinite, the objectifications of will in the temporal flow of life finite, and that is why life is inherently unsatisfactory--not merely because of some contingent misery or special misfortune.","filename":"1477865219469","ext":".jpg","w":871,"h":577,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":82,"tim":1492180035355,"time":1492180035,"md5":"kVz2OO+6Rx36jthpJnjcnw==","fsize":229427,"resto":121062551,"id":"eXIIFIqD","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121065854,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)10:28:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121062814\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121062814<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121062952\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121062952<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;there are no depressed or suicidal religious people<\/span><br><a href=\"#p121064527\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121064527<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;there is no genetic propensity for mental illness<\/span>","time":1492180090,"resto":121062551,"id":"QbPKVIfN","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121066213,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)10:31:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"I agree with the working towards something, be that a house, holiday, whatever. I also suggest getting a hobby or passion OP, best would be something that requires steady work to improve at. <br>You could learn to draw and paint things from memory\/imagination over on \/ic\/, use those skills on other boards like \/tg\/, etc. since you like games why not learn how to make your own one, or make a mod DLC for an existing game like all thosr skyrim and fallout ones. learn an instrument or language, hell, if you find something like that you really enjoy it could become a side job or even career, and make you more than minimum wage.<br><br>Your mind has so much capacity but you have to feed it, bite off more than you can chew and then chew it. It&#039;s hard to do anything when depressed but working on my hobbies helped me have some kind of progress each day and something to look forward to tomorrow.","time":1492180288,"resto":121062551,"id":"Ti09l2yy","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121066342,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)10:32:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"how about i increase your rent so you work 60 hours a week. <br><br>no more bordem","time":1492180369,"resto":121062551,"id":"n8Fq\/zqY","country":"CN","country_name":"China"},{"no":121066410,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)10:33:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121065576\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121065576<\/a><br>Holy shit just did a quick calculator, I earn \u00a313000 per year after tax-NI <br>A third of that is around \u00a34,333<br>After saving that for 30 years I would end up with \u00a3130k<br>That would not get you fuck all here not even a flat never mind a house with a garden<br><br>I&#039;m so fucked holy shit..","time":1492180411,"resto":121062551,"id":"jSJTvpsE","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121066450,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)10:33:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121066342\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121066342<\/a><br>How about you do something about the Norks?","time":1492180436,"resto":121062551,"id":"5Rp0QsrE","country":"LT","country_name":"Lithuania"},{"no":121066534,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)10:34:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121066450\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121066450<\/a><br><br>no one is paying us to do it. <br><br>why would we shit up our neighbourhood for the USA? <br><br>fuck&#039;em, they keep impacting our operations.","time":1492180486,"resto":121062551,"id":"n8Fq\/zqY","country":"CN","country_name":"China"},{"no":121066632,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)10:35:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121062551\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121062551<\/a><br>evolve your consciousness","time":1492180535,"resto":121062551,"id":"GHyZ8Med","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121066736,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)10:36:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121062551\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121062551<\/a><br>I took up woodworking, guns, cooking, and landscaping.","time":1492180587,"resto":121062551,"id":"vXPbTKtm","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121066800,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)10:37:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121062551\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121062551<\/a><br>spend the next 3 years training harder than you ever have, save all your money and use it to create a christian militia and go to the middle east to resume the crusades","time":1492180624,"resto":121062551,"id":"BGlcSqX+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121066888,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)10:37:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121062551\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121062551<\/a><br><br>i went exploring the city by myself and wound up in some hipster like bars, ended up getting laid<br><br>and she stayed over and played videogames with me for hours, till i got sick of the bitch she didn&#039;t want to fucking leave my house and wanted to stay another night.

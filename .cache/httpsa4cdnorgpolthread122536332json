I feel they are allowed to exist because they give people a way to take out their anger which makes them less likely to actually revolt and get violent.<br><br>I cant exactly articulate it, but i feel as though comfort is the source of most of the degeneracy around us. Just compare the great depression era generation to boomers and what has continued to come after them. Specifically i think about women and how different things are when the world is comfortable and easy vs when it is rough and they actually have to rely on men. Modern women are literally a byproduct of this shit. I guess im just very jaded, but over the past few days of going to malls, walmart and other places i havent been in years, i see so much degeneracy, people, and things that wouldnt be possible to exist without this system we live in. <br><br>I dont think things can be fixed politically. The genie cannot be put back into the bottle, but even if it could, the majority of people dont even want it to be put back in because many people benefit from it. Since it cannot be fixed and because people dont want to go back, the only way is a complete societal reset.

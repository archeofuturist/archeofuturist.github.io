They stand in a long line, sadly counting the people ahead of them and marking off the minutes until it will be their turn to board this political train. They wait a long time for any change in the office they have fixed their eye on, and are grateful for any scandal which thins the ranks ahead of them. Occasionally, someone refuses to move from his office, which makes the ones in line feel like there has almost been a violation of a sacred promise. Then, they grow spiteful and do not rest until the bold politician holding onto their office is ousted. After that, he won\u2019t hold office again anytime soon. If one of these creatures is forced to give up his post, he will immediately try to crowd into the waiting lines again, that is, unless he is prevented by the yelling and abuse from the others.&quot;","time":1493512233,"resto":123398944,"id":"MZ+eH2bD","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123408128,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)20:30:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123407176\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123407176<\/a><br>off yourself","time":1493512234,"resto":123398944,"id":"NCic4Rmc","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123408149,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)20:30:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123402151\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123402151<\/a>","filename":"fascism","ext":".png","w":417,"h":750,"tn_w":69,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493512244039,"time":1493512244,"md5":"0Puk0XphGSE9nqV2OM0oaw==","fsize":170625,"resto":123398944,"id":"yR5jAIpF","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123408272,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)20:31:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123404625\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123404625<\/a><br>Awwww yis.

There is no other principle as wrong as the parliamentary principle. We can say this without even referring to the way the election of the honorable deputies takes place, the way they get into office, and the way titles are given to them. Only in a tiny fraction of cases are the offices filled based on widespread desire and certainly it does not stem from any need. It is obvious to anyone that the political understanding of the masses has not reached the point where they can arrive at political views on their own. They are incapable of picking out the most qualified person. What we always call \u201cpublic opinion\u201d is based only on individual experience or knowledge.

Consequently, it is not responsible for anything since the final decision does not rest with anyone in the government, but with the majority of Parliament.

Its political capacity can really only be judged by its skill in either conforming to the will of the majority or convincing the majority to switch to its side.

The five hundred representatives of the people present a disjointed and usually a pitiful picture if you look at their dissimilar occupations or their varied political abilities. Surely no one would assume that those elected by the nation are chosen because of their ability to reason or their intellect. I hope no one is foolish enough to think that hundreds of statesmen can emerge from ballot boxes which have been stuffed by those who themselves only posses an average intelligence. We can never denounce sharply enough the silly idea that geniuses are discovered through general elections. The average nation only finds a real statesman once in a blue moon, not a hundred at a time. The masses will oppose any outstanding genius because it is their instinct. A camel can pass through the eye of a needle sooner than a great man can be \u201cdiscovered\u201d by an election. History has always shown that those who rose above the average level did so through the driving force of an individual personality. Now we have five hundred people of mere modest ability voting on the most important issues of the nation and installing a government which requires the approval of the exalted five hundred. This government in turn learns that to secure its position it must carry out the policy of the five hundred. Unfortunately, the policy is actually created by five hundred people and it carries the same shabby appearance.&quot;","time":1493513166,"resto":123398944,"id":"MZ+eH2bD","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123410563,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)20:46:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123409970\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123409970<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;facists want to take your stuff<\/span><br>They don&#039;t, look up free enterprise national socialism (hint, it&#039;s the same as national socialism), but keep your plastic shit that breaks every week that you bought from a jew.","time":1493513168,"resto":123398944,"id":"3DIgOxdS","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123410616,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)20:46:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123398944\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123398944<\/a><br>No I do not want fascism. <br>I do recognize that Antifa are infact fascists completely negating their name.

YouTube is under attack by companies that are scared of having ads show up on racist, sexist, terrorist channels! Their definition is vague as shit! The Old Media is using this as a takedown of Alterative Media!<br><br>https:\/\/pastebin.com\/h92n7QQb<br><br>This is the current list of companies in the boycott! Email them, no spam! Each letter should be composed respectfully! Explain to them why it&#039;s important for them to stay the fuck out of the political sphere! Once they have control over where their ads appear, they will be forced to have opinions, which will divide their audience! YouTubers will be greatful if they break the boycott, and their audiences are huge and very invested! Go for it!","filename":"yt_1200-vfl4C3T0K","ext":".png","w":1200,"h":1200,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490979674291,"time":1490979674,"md5":"4C3T0KWb5Tk6ld1MT433wg==","fsize":17143,"resto":0,"id":"1juIAznD","country":"IL","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"youtube-counterboycott-operation","country_name":"Israel","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

Further, the advertisement made no reference to homosexual relationships. There was no innuendo or further suggestion of anything other than a distinctive voice. The character depicted was not intended to be homosexual.\u201d<br><br>The Advertising Standards Board concluded that, while the fish does have a \u201ccamp\u201d voice, it was \u201cnot sexualised and its gender was not clear.\u201d The ad is cleared for airing on television.","filename":"goldfish","ext":".png","w":1000,"h":643,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":160,"tim":1490903623619,"time":1490903623,"md5":"oIZlyZUWTnqygzqK7IZBWg==","fsize":1326919,"resto":0,"id":"2ir\/QkLW","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"is-this-fish-gay","country_name":"United States","replies":3,"images":2,"unique_ips":4},{"no":118961318,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)16:07:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"Obligatory. <br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=3Vn<wbr>2xrSG24w","time":1490904464,"resto":118959666,"id":"kCiSVcC1","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118961509,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)16:09:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118959666\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118959666<\/a><br>Just another aussie after being railed by emus","filename":"aussie nightmare","ext":".gif","w":646,"h":466,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":90,"tim":1490904560749,"time":1490904560,"md5":"kstFwu+WvIzP4IyQyPFl3A==","fsize":881382,"resto":118959666,"id":"x4SKqMcP","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118962316,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)16:16:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118959666\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118959666<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;gay men<\/span><br><br>DID THEY JUST ASSUME THE GENDER OF THAT FISH?!","filename":"spengbub","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":780,"tn_w":102,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490904979604,"time":1490904979,"md5":"et77j9ZnrjYi\/z8aqivHDg==","fsize":136407,"resto":118959666,"id":"cPEZth07","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]}

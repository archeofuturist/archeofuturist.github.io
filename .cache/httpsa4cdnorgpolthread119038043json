Do you even proper nationalist studies?<br><br>As of now, there are probably 3 main schools of nationalism:<br><br>Primordialism<br>The nation is an ancient entity existing long ago, perhaps starting when society and civilisation started to form.<br><br>Modernism<br>The nation is a constructed thing that grew out in recent times. Some think it&#039;s largely due to the historical and sociopolitical circumstances after industrialisation.<br><br>Ethnosymbolism<br>The nation is a recent hing, but not socially constructed per se. Its seeds have long been there, things like a common language, myths, etc., and around these proto-nations, or ethnies, were born, which were then evolved and\/or combined into a proper nation.<br><br>What are your thoughts, \/pol\/? I&#039;m surprised nobody here, for all the nationalism that is displayed, actually mention or know anything about actual academic research into nationalism.<br><br>The whole ethnic vs civic thing is practically a meme just like the whole left vs right scheme.

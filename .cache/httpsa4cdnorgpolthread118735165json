Jared Polis, (D-Colo.) said in testifying against the bill. &quot;They shouldn&#039;t be forced to sell and give that information to who-knows-who simply for the price of admission for access to the internet.&quot;<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The vote overturned rules passed in October by the Federal Communications Commission that tightened limits on what internet service providers (ISPs) could do with their users&#039; data. The rules, which would have taken effect later this year, required ISPs to notify consumers about the type of information they collect, and obtain their consent, before selling it to third parties. The rules also made ISPs more accountable for preventing data breaches.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The measure was passed on a 215-to-205 vote, with most Republicans in favor of the repeal and most Democrats against. It still needs to be signed by President Donald Trump before it will become law, though that appears to be a given after the White House expressed support for the repeal on Tuesday.<\/span>","filename":"eye_photo","ext":".jpg","w":630,"h":354,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1490754805390,"time":1490754805,"md5":"+Vdoka+8Dj\/1EQmmuVjm9A==","fsize":64093,"resto":0,"id":"\/id3Kskf","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"republicans-just-voted-to-let-internet-service","country_name":"United States","replies":274,"images":41,"unique_ips":142,"tail_size":50},{"no":118735533,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)22:36:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"Strange way to make America great again.","time":1490754996,"resto":118735165,"id":"wKoPP+pY","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118735777,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)22:38:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118735165\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118735165<\/a><br>And Democrats voted to allow thousands of dangerous foreigners into America with out knowing jack shit about them other than they will vote democrat.","time":1490755137,"resto":118735165,"id":"DbnDLmE3","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118735992,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)22:41:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118735777\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118735777<\/a><br>Thats not what OP was talking about.

The FTC had the authority to bring enforcement actions against companies who engaged in &quot;unfair and deceptive practices.&quot; The 2015 reclassification of broadband providers removed internet service providers (ISPs) from the FTC&#039;s jurisdiction. On April 20, 2016, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) proposed a rule applying privacy requirements of the Communications Act to Internet Service Providers (ISPs). However, the proposed rule would not apply to edge providers and web sites, like Facebook and Twitter, since they still fall under the FTC&#039;s authority.<br>As you know, Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona introduced S.J. Res. 34 on March 7, 2017. This resolution would repeal the FCC&#039;s privacy rules. I do not believe a two-track system in which the FCC regulates ISPs while the FTC monitors the rest of the internet ecosystem is good for consumers. For this reason I cosponsored S.J.

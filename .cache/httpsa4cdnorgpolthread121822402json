Believing that racial differences are only on a visual level is stupid. The different races on this planet have evolved in their respective natural environments, which had different demands on the people. Negroes adapted to the African sun, Europeans adapted to the cold and wet Europe, American Indians adapted to the great valleys and steppes and forests. This evolution did not magically stop at the brain; the natural environment demanded certain ways of thinking in order to survive. Culture comes from behaviour, behaviour comes from the brain, the brain comes from the race.<br><br><br>The &quot;skeptic community&quot;, whoever claims to be a part of it, is pretty retarded when it cannot skeptically evaluate the lie of equality they have been fed through Jewish controlled media.","time":1492591410,"resto":121822402,"id":"NurwpEzG","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":121822727,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)04:44:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121822636\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121822636<\/a><br>That&#039;s it.<br><br>Thanks Hans.","filename":"Twittereb10fd9","ext":".jpg","w":440,"h":577,"tn_w":95,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492591497095,"time":1492591497,"md5":"j3xZO2L7eKoj59LEnwpAyg==","fsize":262144,"resto":121822402,"id":"Ya5iwQ+x","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":121822926,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)04:48:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121822636\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121822636<\/a><br>The ultimate redpill.<br>Screencapped.","time":1492591683,"resto":121822402,"id":"Eal0i8nV","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":121823192,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)04:52:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121822636\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121822636<\/a><br>Short thread, good thread.<br>Fpbp","time":1492591961,"resto":121822402,"id":"bCN3g0Ys","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121824159,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)05:08:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121822402\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121822402<\/a><br><br><br> When I was reading your words in my peripheral vision it looked like the model in the thumbnail was looking to the left of the photo.

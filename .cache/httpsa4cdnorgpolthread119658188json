The former was bred to exhibit certain characteristics wanton aggression, propensity to fight, physical strength, powerful bite, and so on. The latter was bred to retrieve birds shot and killed by its masters, and to do this, it has to have a docile, placid, non aggressive nature; otherwise it would treat what it found as its own kill and refuse to hand it over.","filename":"1482640488197","ext":".gif","w":680,"h":567,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":104,"tim":1491428940920,"time":1491428940,"md5":"wTxFftsMpgdgUWr5lcefLQ==","fsize":2790345,"resto":119658188,"id":"VBV\/VcVS","country":"MX","country_name":"Mexico"},{"no":119661241,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)17:49:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119661163\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119661163<\/a><br>Now imagine that your small children, aged maybe two or three years old, are going to be locked in a room with five or six of those dogs, and the dogs haven&#039;t been fed for a week.

Or do you figure that, even though they look differently, they&#039;re all the same species really, so of course the pit bulls certainly won&#039;t act any differently? Exactly! All this PC crap we hear spouted in the media about how &quot;there&#039;s no such thing as race&quot; is just that crap. A dog has four legs and a tail; a cat also has four legs and a tail, but that doesn&#039;t make it a dog. The superficial similarity between cats and dogs and between whites and blacks is just that superficial. If there really were no genetic difference between niggers and humans, then presumably my white woman and I could very easily produce a black baby between us at any time, and any nigger and his ho a white one.

Thus, Africa has the jungle; black enclaves have &quot;da &#039;hood.&quot; Native Africans were small wandering herds of marginal animals, one famine away from extinction, and which therefore fought each other savagely for pieces of territory. Large groups of &quot;African Americans&quot; at liberty in the west actually deliberately break themselves down into smaller, tribal hordes, because they feel uneasy in and unaccustomed to a larger society.

As for your second question, there are explicit Qur&#039;anic verses on female companions in the Paradise. (The number 72 is not from the Qur&#039;an I guess but probably from some Hadith.)

The problem is the Western equation of jihad=holy war. It is an ongoing projection in this case. As for the second part of your question, Jesus (peace be upon him!) was given some supernatural powers by God but not because &quot;he was God&quot;, but because God gave them to him.

The problem with most &quot;eastern religions&quot; is that they are not religions. Please read Cavanaugh&#039;s &quot;The Myth of Religious Violence&quot; to understand how Western scholars invented them as religions. Or Josephson&#039;s article about the invention of Shintoism as a religion. Finally, on, Islam is not &quot;insane&quot;. It is the most reasonable religion when you study it.<br><a href=\"#p122945134\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122945134<\/a><br>Islam prohibits racism.

They walk around with the school ties and are all so insufferably cliquey. The university actually built ersatz Oxford quadrangles and they ponce about as though they&#039;re at Oxbridge. But I have met quite a few, but you don&#039;t have to believe me.<br><br>I was simply trying to make the point that we used to have smart people from all classes at university, now increasingly, only the upper-middle class go. <br><br><a href=\"#p121936732\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121936732<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I&#039;m sure. Eton students are idiots despite the entrance exams, but YOU and the poor black kids are just geniuses denied opportunity right?<\/span><br>I&#039;m not black, but you have to be a numpty not to see the connection that the worst pubic schools perform better than the best comprehensive schools because the public schools have more money and unpozzed departments? The children of the elite don&#039;t go to comprehensives, they are drilled for public schools from pre-school age up. And donations are always welcome. Indeed, there are exams now, but the wealthy drill their children with tuition and they still have to be able to pay the fees. It costs ~\u00a3250,000 to put your child through Eton. Grammar schools were free and wiped the floor with the public schools.<br><br><a href=\"#p121936275\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121936275<\/a><br>I think the point the other anon was making, and the point I was making, is that IQ is not the most significant factor in terms of getting good grades, going to university and earning money. The reason national education standards are declining is because our education system is so poor, not because people have become genetically inferior over the past 40 years.","time":1492655275,"resto":121933062,"id":"GpVvm98e","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121938261,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)22:28:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121937280\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121937280<\/a><br>Nobody finds this meme funny.","time":1492655330,"resto":121933062,"id":"SUO3cBgJ","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121938319,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)22:29:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121938261\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121938261<\/a><br>This is a truth","time":1492655358,"resto":121933062,"id":"dmhZCNe3","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121938338,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)22:29:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121937050\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121937050<\/a><br>gunners are usually autistic rich cunts who have rarely if ever visited London so it fits","time":1492655370,"resto":121933062,"id":"J9k4p1XE","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"}]}

The US can leverage China because of our business relations with them and Russia for future business relations, but how come it hasn&#039;t happened already, unless. <br><br>Unless Russia, China, North Korea and every country on the communist spectrum envision a world where the US and NATO isn&#039;t on the map. And the last 10 years have been secretly coming up with a plan to ensure this. It makes sense, Russia is planning on making Nukes capable of destroying entire countries the size of France. Russia is planning on coming out with a non detectable, mobile train that&#039;s capable of launching a nuke at any moments notice without the intervention or the awareness of US surveillance agencies. China is still keeping mum on everything to come off neutral for business reasons, but it isn&#039;t a secret that China values Russia more then the US. <br><br>These threats aren&#039;t empty ramblings of a deluded madman, they&#039;re a call for ww3. <br><br>If China doesn&#039;t put an end to North Koreas threats within the next few weeks, then its clear their true allegiance is with them, and that makes China our enemy. <br><br>If we put economic sanctions on China, they will retaliate with war nonetheless.

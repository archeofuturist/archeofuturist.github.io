People don&#039;t trust each other because they are becoming more dissimilar than ever on all grounds. Moreover, the tendency of capitalism to immediately serve their desires is making them impatient and forget their true goals. Look at Japan: they have commodified sex, friendship, courting, flirting and dating. As a result, people don&#039;t date, don&#039;t have friends, don&#039;t have patience to deal with each other, don&#039;t marry, don&#039;t have children. But they are willing to drop huge sums of cash to spend a night talking with some stranger in a bar who pretends to care about you. Yes, this is a thing. So, the fact Japan and Europe\/US are so different when it comes to social interaction shows you it&#039;s not just social media. This is a trend which started in the 1960s, namely the period when people were brainwashed into believing they didn&#039;t have to be useful members of society; they didn&#039;t have to contribute anything. Instead, they existed to please themselves and to be &quot;happy&quot; - and that means freeing yourself from others.<br>Societies in the West used to be much more of a whole than they are now.<br><br>On crime, I must ask you where the fuck you live in Australia. I live in a relatively safe country and I have been to many others. In all of them, parents are afraid to let their kids roam the streets freely during the day. They might still let them do it but they are worried nonetheless. There is a general feeling that people are more unsafe even though crime is going down. If it was all thanks to poverty, as you say, this feeling would make no sense. But I&#039;m sure you will quickly point out to &quot;biases&quot; to justify your bullshit.<br><br>Cultures are not simply changing.

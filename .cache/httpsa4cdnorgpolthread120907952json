Now it&#039;s time to start a bigger campaign then #firekushner. This campaign will galvanize support for Palestinians and compare them to Mexicans. Neutering Israel&#039;s ability to treat them like terrorists. We start trending hashtags that promote Palestine on an equal footing as Mexico. Why would we do this you ask? Well if Israel pushes out bannon we force the Jews to make a false peace with the Muslims guaranteeing war. How do we do that? Massive online campaign started by racist online trolls effectively joining sides with lefties and Muslims to fuck Israel over Palestine. How do we drive this message home? Dank Palestinian memes proving Palestine is no different from poor Mexico. We equate Palestinians to migrants who deserve Israeli citizenship for being born on Israeli land. We equate Palestinians missile program to a program of peace to support Israel&#039;s pricey iron dome. We turn the Palestinian president into a Che Guevara type of leader. We equate Palestine to being the true chosen ones waiting to join Israel peacefully and influence it through democracy and voting. The reason we are doing this is obvious. The Jews have fucked for far to long with our immigration policies. It&#039;s time to start a Twitter trending campaign to be pro Palestine and anti Israel on the same basis of Muslim migrants to Europe. We must demand citizenship for all Palestinians, gun rights, missile rights, sharia rights, and freedom to use box trucks as weapons. Otherwise Israel is being xenophobic, sexist, and homophobic for not allowing in the religion of peace. This can be far bigger then fire Kushner. This can&#039; actually neuter Israel and Kushners ability to keep the spotlight off Palestine and force them to the table to make amends. Regardless a peace deal with Muslims will fail and the more we help Palestine gain more legitimacy the worse Israel looks. #israeliecitizenshipforpalestine #noillegalimmigrantsjustpalestinian<wbr>s","filename":"1490855601130","ext":".jpg","w":782,"h":814,"tn_w":240,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492089124618,"time":1492089124,"md5":"L7trYLMFNPEGtmXrp4H8WQ==","fsize":136976,"resto":0,"id":"nq3XPHch","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"why-cant-we-compare-palestinians-to-mexicans-to","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":120910361,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)09:38:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"#openbordersforisrael","time":1492090704,"resto":120907952,"id":"JtRmvfYi","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"}]}

Ain&#039;t it fucking great?<br><br>I don&#039;t actually browse 4chan there; I spend 2-3 hours planning my next vacation online though.<br><br>Best part is the leave accrual. I can literally take 2 weeks off twice per year, plus 12 holidays, and never run out of leave. Oh, and on the weeks I am not taking vacation or getting a day off for a holiday, I work a four day week so I get three day (at least) weekends every week. At retirement I get cashed out for 12 weeks leave and get 33 percent cashout at anything above that, which of course will be zero since I&#039;ll just take vacation from my last actual workday until retirement.<br><br>$300 deductible + 90 percent coverage on medical and dental, zero premium contribution. Defined benefit pension plus Social Security plus 401K from previous jobs plus jackpot on home equity when I sell; I&#039;ll do better retired than I did working.<br><br>Non core worksite with plenty of parking. 2 miles from my house. Literally 50 minutes commuting time per week. Fridays I work alone as my worthless co-workers are off on their 3 day weekends too. Spend 2 hours rapping with cute Thai chick who works there.<br><br>Low responsibility, low performance threshold. Short of stealing the payroll or killing someone, I can&#039;t get fired.<br><br>Sweet as fucking fuck. But, like the old Joe Walsh song, &quot;I can&#039;t complain but sometimes I still do.&quot; That&#039;s when I go to the business agent for the union.

This perspective may be quite helpful because it is very pro-woman and focuses on how pornography and gender identity are harmful to women.<br><br>For example, on the topic of how feminism went from anti-pornography to pro-pornography<br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=kDc<wbr>Tt0emXhE<br><br>And on the origins of the gender identity movement.<br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Ot8<wbr>cBm0YmXo<br><br>In a second step you can introduce her to the right-wing perspective, which has overlaps. For example, the gender identity movement has its origins with Judith Butler who is Jewish. Most of the shift towards sexualization is also due to Jews.<br><br>In particular, regarding the oversexualization of society, E. Michael Jones has written and spoken extensively on this subject.

In terms of entry level details, if she were to bring up something about refugees in Europe and something like &quot;why wouldn&#039;t Germany take them in?&quot; I would respond with assimilation issues, Islam and how many refugees will have sentiments toward radical actions as well as how even an average refugee may have vastly differing cultural beliefs that do not mesh with our ideas in western civ, thus resulting in sky rocketing sex crimes rates and terrorism. I asked her to think about each terrorist incident and why they tend to always be Muslim, a refugee, or both. This would also lead me into talking about the importance of borders, and how with so much evidence that open borders result in these horrific incidents, why globalists still insist on doing it. I requested she look into what type of people promote the open border idea. Elite pedophile rings started with of course the podesta emails and pizza, but more importantly I focused on things like the franklin scandal and how many of these pedophiles up top own businesses that will enable this behavior. The sexualization of society I would talk about how it&#039;s dangerous in the sense that it can undermine the family unit, weaken the men to the point where they&#039;d be useless in a war, etc. I talked about how these types of beliefs are produced by universities and churn out many of the people that would identify as liberal, which would hopefully introduce her to the idea of liberals living in a dream world. <br><br>This is on the fly here.

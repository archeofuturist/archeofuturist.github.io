The earliest civilizations founded mystery schools where their ideas were passed on to the next generations through a series of progressive initiations. Then came Alexander the Great who went around conquering all these people and collecting their teachings. He thought Egypt was the bees knees so founded the Library at Alexandria to compile them all together. The Alexandrians considered all these and subsequent writings to come from Hermes\/Thoth and attributed all their written wisdom to him. Then came the Romans who thought the Alexandrians were too smart and were making it hard to control the people so they fuckered with Christianity removing the most esoteric teachings from it and turning it into an opiate of the masses and eventually used it to get Christians to burn the library. Then the teachings had to be taught secretly on pain of death and many ideas were lost as we fell into the dark ages. Then came the Crusades and Knights Templar who were reexposed to many of these ideas through their dickerings in the middle east. However, the kings and pope thought they were getting too big for their britches and eliminated them so everything went secret again but was kept alive by the alchemists. Some of these alchemists started the Rosicrucians and a rebirth of Hermetic thought and helped usher in the Rennaisance. The Freemasons came around a while later and some of them came to America and started the good ol&#039; USofA. Since they traced the roots of their ideas back to Alexandria in Egypt they used lots of Egyptian symbolism. This explanation is obvs a great over simplification and is basically the tl;dr cuz I could write encyclopedias on this shit.","time":1492948862,"resto":122403973,"id":"1wTxj5gE","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122415202,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)08:01:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122414911\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122414911<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Bill Cooper<\/span><br><br>Thank you.

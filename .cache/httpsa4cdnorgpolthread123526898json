The true funny people in history went against the grain, not with it. Rodney Dangerfield and Richard Pryor were slumming it up in shitty comedy clubs because all of the old losers in charge of media couldn&#039;t handle any humor that different, that was considered crude and disgusting. How the hell could Samantha Bee be crude so as to piss any of us off?","filename":"3","ext":".jpg","w":534,"h":306,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":71,"tim":1493592738640,"time":1493592738,"md5":"3VsFRu0WzW1u5Qg0y0NwPg==","fsize":28724,"resto":123526898,"id":"1DkrL\/FV","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123539721,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)18:52:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123539523\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123539523<\/a><br>watching Trumptards try to defend all of his fuck ups is unintentionally funny, I&#039;ll grant that.","time":1493592759,"resto":123526898,"id":"W\/pukuJw","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123539727,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)18:52:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123538688\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123538688<\/a><br>aren&#039;t chapo right-wing satire of socialists, inspired by the likes of colbert<br>otherwise working for u.s. spooks would really awkward","time":1493592761,"resto":123526898,"id":"xsEs3K3r","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123539867,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)18:53:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123529283\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123529283<\/a><br>Trying to not be offensive while being a standup comedian is like eating a steak without killing the cow.

You might have seen in the news lately that The Rock is getting a lot of political attention. He was recently on the cover of the most popular conservative journal\/magazine in America, National Review. The Rock has said he&#039;s open to running for political office before, AND he&#039;s the epitome of the based black Republican meme, so here&#039;s the idea: <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Start a draft campaign urging him to run for Governor<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Create political memes about him and attempt to grow the campaign into an actual movement carried on by normies<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Get the meme and speculation into the media, with the goal of getting a response from The Rock himself<\/span><br>It&#039;s not even a doubt in my mind that he would absolutely smash Gavin Newsom. And he seems open to this kind of thing.

Not when everyone has a handheld internet portal and can go looking for the Truth. Your only chance at survival is to ditch the commentary and the personal bias and report the facts. All the facts.

You&#039;re here forever.","time":1490377817,"resto":118097352,"id":"aNrzNR0c","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118106598,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)13:50:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118101652\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118101652<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;mf after laughing at you for being retarded and the sad realization that you were in fact actually retarded<\/span>","filename":"tommy_cristopher_shareblue_writer","ext":".jpg","w":250,"h":300,"tn_w":104,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490377853671,"time":1490377853,"md5":"H0gg\/0xdOGm56c166tAajA==","fsize":31628,"resto":118097352,"id":"EqYYfbyB","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118106706,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)13:52:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"ITT: fatland autism","time":1490377921,"resto":118097352,"id":"3n5Y7oNs","country":"HR","country_name":"Croatia"},{"no":118106724,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)13:52:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118102506\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118102506<\/a><br>they did by calling it fake news<br>https:\/\/trends.google.com\/trends\/ex<wbr>plore?date=today%2012-m&amp;q=%22fake%2<wbr>0news%22,pizzagate","time":1490377930,"resto":118097352,"id":"BS3yAkFv","country":"BE","country_name":"Belgium"},{"no":118106760,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)13:52:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118099501\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118099501<\/a><br>\/thread<br><br>fucking larper didnt provide even proof. why is \/pol\/ so easily baited?","time":1490377945,"resto":118097352,"id":"BbADzUAG","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":118106924,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)13:53:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118106529\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118106529<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;the worst democratic nominee since Micheal Dukakis<\/span><br><br>walter mondale, i&#039;d say.<br><br>and there&#039;s no way that the network who promised bill to &quot;deliver him the election&quot; would ever consider impartiality.","time":1490378033,"resto":118097352,"id":"zyYF+dJd","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118106940,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)13:54:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118097352\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118097352<\/a><br>You know, if the building you are in were to collapse, and kill all the CNN employees, we would cheer your deaths.<br>You know that&#039;s the truth don&#039;t you? <br>If one of your remote broadcast vans were to be hit by a train while crossing some railroad tracks and everyone in the van died, we would all cheer your deaths.<br>Think about that a minute.<br>That is how far you have fallen.","filename":"nixonobamawiretapped","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":663,"tn_w":94,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490378043670,"time":1490378043,"md5":"amvxrJi81DRwsPWt5gZ8oA==","fsize":79468,"resto":118097352,"id":"nIS2Ld\/4","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118107008,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)13:54:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118106760\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118106760<\/a><br>It&#039;s \/nu\/pol and they haven&#039;t learned how to sage yet.","time":1490378076,"resto":118097352,"id":"JXz\/+z1I","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118107316,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)13:57:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118100008\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118100008<\/a><br>They never learn their lesson.

Listen to me, man! I think we should vote for Enoch Powell. Enoch&#039;s our man. I think Enoch&#039;s right, I think we should send them all back. Stop Britain from becoming a black colony. Get the foreigners out. Get the wogs out. Get the coons out. Keep Britain white. I used to be into dope, now I&#039;m into racism. It&#039;s much heavier, man. Fucking wogs, man.

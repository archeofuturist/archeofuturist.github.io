In addition to some Google Fiber cities in the US, Seoul, South Korea is now experimenting with 1 Gbps connection speeds in some parts, and yet in spite of all of this the average connection speed even in the countries with the best connection speeds is only about 30 Mbps. Why is this exactly? Is the cost of fiber infrastructure just too much to implement, even in small and densely populated countries like Japan or South Korea? Why aren&#039;t we all experiencing reliable &gt; 200 Mbps internet connections by now?","filename":"AvgInternetSpeedCountries3","ext":".png","w":1940,"h":1050,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":135,"tim":1492217278643,"time":1492217278,"md5":"1\/hlYSjvZeDh1PEte9NSQg==","fsize":369679,"resto":0,"id":"qg8+Wf+0","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"why-are-average-internet-connection-speeds-so-low","country_name":"United States","replies":14,"images":3,"unique_ips":13},{"no":121142362,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)20:49:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121142198\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121142198<\/a><br>Because in reality you&#039;re a 3rd world country.","time":1492217357,"resto":121142198,"id":"Smu8yScw","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":121142789,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)20:52:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121142198\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121142198<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Fiber<\/span><br>Fibre.","time":1492217546,"resto":121142198,"id":"EmDrqgo0","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121142829,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)20:52:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"Why is internet connection so slow in Italy anyway.

Also, for a while the cable company had some kind of monopoly here dealing with internet, not sure if that&#039;s widespread or not.

The German Emperors modelled themselves on the Austrian Emperors, who had modelled themselves on the Greek and Roman Emperors. The greatest of the Prussians [Frederick the Great] did not conceal his contempt for Prussia. He refused to talk anything but French, or to exchange ideas, except [with] somebody of the type of Voltaire. Then came the liberal ideas of the French Revolution, and the whole movement of German Unity was originally a liberal movement on the lines of the French Revolution.<br>Then came the more modern and much more mortally dangerous idea of Race, which the Germans borrowed from a Frenchman named Gobineau. And on top of that idea of Race, came the grand, imperial idea of a Chosen Race, of a sacred seed that is, as the Kaiser said, the salt of the earth; of a people that is God\u2019s favourite and guided by Him, in a sense in which He does not guide other and lesser peoples. And if anybody asks where anybody got that idea, there is only one possible or conceivable answer. He got it from the Jews.<br>[...]<br>Thus, German mysticism became more and more like Jewish mysticism : a thing not thinking much of ordinary human beings, the hewers of wood and drawers of water, the Gentiles or the strangers; but thinking with intense imagination of the idea of a holy house or family, alone dedicated to heaven and therefore to triumph. This is the great Prussian illusion of pride, for which thousands of Jews have recently been rabbled or ruined or driven from their-homes. I am certainly not enough of an Anti-Semite to say :that it served them right.","time":1492585873,"resto":121815355,"id":"SLR88nNt","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121816936,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)03:12:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121816728\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121816728<\/a><br>The people are obedient to God and obedient to the State if the State is obedient to God.<br><br>like how women should be obedient to men <br><br>the state is made up of people<br>those people must be obedient to God <br>if not, the whole thing is pointless.

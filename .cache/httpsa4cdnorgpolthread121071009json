I don&#039;t doubt your sincerity. The thing is though that your feelings will change over time. That&#039;s when it becomes a little more nuanced than your current perception. And it often happens the female decides she wants to separate even if there&#039;s nothing particularly wrong with the relationship. Happens all the time. It is quite rare for men to divorce because of familiarity and lack of excitement or not being in love anymore. Women do it often, especially when younger than 40. Why? Because most females are practically slaves to their feelings and hence rationalize everything according to their feelings without grasping the fact their feelings will always change. <br><br>D you think the people who end up in an acrimonious divorce hated each other when they married? Of course not. And that stuff still happens.<br><br>Anyway, you&#039;re speaking 100% with your feelings. I hope you understand what you feel now is NOT what makes your marriage last.

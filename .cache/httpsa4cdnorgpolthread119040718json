He has tried to sell our country to the EU faggots, as will Jankovic and Jeremic. He has done nothing for Belgrade or the more &quot;populated&quot; centers of Serbia.

It&#039;s not any better cause of him and his &quot;supposed successes&quot;. He keeps claiming he&#039;s scored many, but I (and the rest of Serbia) are yet to see this &quot;better style of life&quot; and &quot;better quality of life&quot; that he has provided us with. The only good thing he&#039;s done is help out the Air Force and PVO by modernizing them and equipping them with more jet fighters and helicopters. The entire Armed Forces are getting re-modernized, which is good. I just hope this isn&#039;t being done to drive us head-first into fucking NATO.","filename":"kek","ext":".jpg","w":391,"h":591,"tn_w":82,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490963130524,"time":1490963130,"md5":"YaAp2N7onFRvKyKpw9ZOtA==","fsize":83685,"resto":119040718,"id":"WTlV53H7","country":"RS","country_name":"Serbia"},{"no":119051329,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)08:25:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119051006\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119051006<\/a><br>Down South is where he has the most support, buddy.

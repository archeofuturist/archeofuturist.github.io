They have their heads shoved so far up their asses that they don&#039;t even realize they&#039;re part of the problem. They&#039;re indoctrinated and won&#039;t even listen if you bring up a viewpoint that challenges the narrative they&#039;re used to. It&#039;s like talking to a wall or a robot. I realised a majority of mankind is really fucking stupid. Stupidly stupid. Dangerously stupid.<br><br>So glad that I don&#039;t have any kids, I have no investment in the future of this planet so I really can stop caring about the chaos and hell that is coming. I can lay back and smile knowing that all these traitors will get what they deserve when their own creation turns against them. The Globe is infected with psychopathic career politicians and the sheeples keep on keep voting them into power. So many people tried to warn them, but they didn&#039;t listen. Born just in time to witness the modern world becoming a hellhole of political correctness, trans-degeneracy, white male hating, safe space needing youths and worldwide Islam invasion. If you understood the path we&#039;re headed down, you&#039;d mentally crack as well.<br><br>The feeling that you are living in an alternate reality to most people and even to speak basic truths about life will get you completely ostracized from a a society that has been the product of the greatest feat of social engineering over the last 70 years since the concept of religion<br><br>The poorly lit room you sit in only brightened by a computer monitor that serves as your connection to the world. Games will be shit, movies will be shit, and hearing other people make small talk will drive you insane. You&#039;ll find ups and downs and you might even drink alcohol to help ease the pain.<br><br>It never goes away though. Delving into politics and into the abyss of the red pill made me completely unable to function. It&#039;s hard to just get out of bed.<br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Mw1<wbr>A8e3tWlM","filename":"1486104331273","ext":".png","w":1592,"h":1728,"tn_w":230,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490300130109,"time":1490300130,"md5":"mqGxQqTCSMY2U7Igk2MFhw==","fsize":509224,"resto":0,"id":"7\/Qxuprf","country":"NO","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"traitors-and-blind-morons-everywhere-they-have","country_name":"Norway","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

If it passed, Judge Pavy would be removed from the bench. At 9:20 p.m., just moments after the House passed the bill, Pavy&#039;s son-in-law Dr. Carl Weiss, a physician from Baton Rouge, Louisiana, approached Long and, according to the generally accepted version of events, fired a handgun at him from four feet away, shooting him in the torso.

At a speech before a crowd at the courthouse in Courtland, Alabama on July 31, Haughey came into a confrontation with a man named Collins, an ally of Hinds who espoused the cause of his Republican opponent. When Haughey was said to have been obnoxious toward Collins, a man known to be prone to violence, a fistfight ensued. The altercation ended when Collins pulled a pistol and fired it into Haughey&#039;s stomach. Confined to a bed, Haughey lingered on for five days before succumbing to his wounds on August 5, 1869 at age 43. He was interred in Green Cemetery near Pinson, Alabama.[1]<br><br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Thoma<wbr>s_Haughey","filename":"Hon._Thomas_Haughey,_Ala._Surgeon,_U.S._Army_-_NARA_-_527423","ext":".jpg","w":800,"h":946,"tn_w":105,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490717091467,"time":1490717091,"md5":"rtyivKjJ88d3wvoKJkeVlQ==","fsize":134804,"resto":118660014,"id":"p+eXjWRO","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118663486,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)12:10:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118662902\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118662902<\/a><br>Attempted Mass Assasination<br><br>It\u2019s the latter, a long-forgotten and fascinating episode, that Kerry Walters has uncovered in his short history, Outbreak in Washington, D.C.

They were still teenagers when they had me so they gave me to my grandmother and my aunt. My mom and dad argued a lot, but they still loved me I guess. Soon, my mother cheated on my dad, and they soon broke up. My dad was really sad since he did want to eventually marry her. Both of them were normalfags who only cared about partying and having fun in their 20s, which later in life lead to consequences.<br><br>I think many of my problems I have today mentally has to do with my family&#039;s lineage of mental illness. The majority of women in my family are extremely bipolar, have anxiety, and have anger issues. When I was little, my grandmother constantly verbally abused me and that pretty much affected me in my life causing me to despise myself at a young and early age.( Nobody in my family really liked each other either.) I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was little, but my grandmother didn&#039;t let me have any medication. That caused me to be an impulsive child who got in trouble alot and got many beatings. I cried myself to sleep a lot...<br><br>I used to get jealous of the other kids, because even though mom and dad would sometimes buy me video games to keep me busy, everyone else had a family who would go out camping and fishing. I wanted to be with my mom and dad with all of us all together too.<br><br>I barely had any friends while growing up. And I don&#039;t even know if the &quot;friends&quot; I had were truly my friends. I remember having to lie to my mom when I was a teenager about hanging out and talking to my friends, but in reality, I was just in the room talking to myself and playing vidya. Being socially autistic was a pain.<br><br>That is all I will tell for now.","filename":"1490024875228","ext":".jpg","w":1000,"h":1059,"tn_w":118,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492788749950,"time":1492788749,"md5":"x48VK\/NxlqTqPoLqUPOuUw==","fsize":705978,"resto":122144563,"id":"AUxYJEGC","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":122148145,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)11:35:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122145087\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122145087<\/a><br>just how fucking old are you m8?","time":1492788947,"resto":122144563,"id":"0CKSNFWw","country":"MX","country_name":"Mexico"},{"no":122148173,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)11:35:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122147823\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122147823<\/a><br>Oh yeah and my parents were christians, but not very religious, though I grew up in a religous household with my grandma and am still very religious.

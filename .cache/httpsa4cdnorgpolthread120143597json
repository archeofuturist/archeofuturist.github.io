Pisagua, a town surrounded by high mountains and the ocean, at the time suffered a mass exodus of its inhabitants, so that it became a perfect fit for the jailing of several people that were persecuted, practice that would later be continued by Gabriel Gonz\u00e1lez Videla and Augusto Pinochet against his political opponents.<br><br>In 1952, when Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez del Campo returned to power, this time in open democratic elections, as president, he continued its repressive policies. During his government he promulgated Law 11625 on Antisocial States and Security Measures (1954) (Ley 11625 sobre Estados Antisociales y Medidas de Seguridad), first proposed during the administration of his predecessor Gonz\u00e1lez Videla, a law establishing various security measures (such as healing internments, fines and imprisonment) against groups of &quot;social dangerousness &quot;, including vagrants, drug addicts and homosexuals, among others.&quot;","filename":"Carlos_Ibanez","ext":".jpg","w":412,"h":600,"tn_w":85,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491673697277,"time":1491673697,"md5":"fj1+Ne4GnyY\/+cVeyvTnOQ==","fsize":83818,"resto":120143597,"id":"EmvBLYMO","country":"CL","country_name":"Chile"},{"no":120159014,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)13:49:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120143597\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120143597<\/a><br>I cant hear shit, the Translator is so fucking quite I barely catch a few word","time":1491673747,"resto":120143597,"id":"3glkcwcs","country":"HU","country_name":"Hungary"},{"no":120159067,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)13:49:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120143597\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120143597<\/a><br>kek<br>http:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/politics\/201<wbr>7\/04\/07\/haley-forces-bolivia-to-def<wbr>end-assad-atrocities-in-public-view<wbr>-at-un-session.html","filename":"UnitedStatesUnderSharia-USUS","ext":".jpg","w":306,"h":370,"tn_w":103,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491673774933,"time":1491673774,"md5":"Apd2rwYs8tcJ1uIk\/KnVtw==","fsize":23709,"resto":120143597,"id":"YgJTx4DF","country":"IN","country_name":"India"},{"no":120159135,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)13:50:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120143597\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120143597<\/a><br>BASED BOLIVIA","time":1491673805,"resto":120143597,"id":"khoPlFLq","country":"CN","country_name":"China"},{"no":120159142,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)13:50:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120158660\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120158660<\/a><br>I know mate, its just laughable that he&#039;d equate a 2004 fox bush article to excusing trumps actions.

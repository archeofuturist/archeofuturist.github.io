That said, I agree that the cost of college here is too high. I would be open to having at least community colleges being completely free of charge so kids could get the math and other prerequisites out of the way, but I would only support this for people pursuing real degrees (a.k.a. STEM), not bullshit history or poly-sci majors.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;- If you get sick or worst (chronic diseases) you have to pay a lot of money. Is this true? At least, this is what I know. Why do you want that healthcare system? It makes no sense for me.<\/span><br><br>Because capitalism is the religion here and medicine is treated as a business and not a basic human right.

In Europe we have 20 days minimum, with most of the companies we get 30 days.<\/span><br><br>Greed and capitalism run rampant. It doesn&#039;t help that corporations are legally treated as persons thanks to Citizens United. Since corporations are required by law do put their bottom line first, they tend to try to give their employees as little as possible (not every business or corporation, to be sure, but many put pennies before people). <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;- Why are you Americans so fucking obsessed with guns? Come on, you know without guns the country would be a safer place, and if you don\u00b4t see that explain me why.<\/span><br><br>Without guns the United States would be the United Colonies. Our Revolutionary War relied heavily on private citizens grabbing their own personal firearms off their mantle place and joining the militia. The inherent right to self-defense and self-protection was enshrined by the founders in the 2nd Amendment for good reason.","time":1493572559,"resto":123494337,"id":"AnPeliYm","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123500386,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)13:25:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123494337\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123494337<\/a><br>Having people pay their own way in life helps maintain what&#039;s known as sovereignty of the individual, the epitome of personal liberty.<br><br>Forcing the masses to pay outrageous taxes and fees to support some moron getting an art appreciation degree or to support some 800lb fat ass getting free liposuction is completely antithetical to personal freedom and a detriment to society.<br><br>We get 14 days + like 8 established holidays.

Because the money is there Universities can charge whatever they like. This is similar to what caused the housing crisis in 2008 and the increase in Healthcare costs due to Obamacare. It is one of the biggest bubbles we have going right now and its collapse will be epic. The expense you pay for university is extracted by force from your tax base. You are paying for university and everyone else&#039;s university under the guns of the state. Heavy taxes are stifling to your productivity<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;On healthcare<\/span><br><br>We pay a lot of money because our care is better. In our Hospitals you are rarely in ward type setting you will have your own room and staff that literally respond to you with the press of a button. In Britain and Sweden you have wait times and wards and if the state doesn&#039;t think you need it then there is no amount of money you can pay to get it. In the UK mothers are having babies in the waiting rooms and in the halls because staff can&#039;t be bothered to wait on them there is no motivation to do so.

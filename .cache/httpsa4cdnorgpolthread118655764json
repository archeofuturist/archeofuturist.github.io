A negative birth rate is slowly ensuring the gradual extinction of the Japanese with the population decreasing by 244,000 in 2013 alone. There have been many attempts to identify and remedy the causes for the population decline. Sociologists have pointed at culture as stifling family life through long work hours and shifting gender roles. The government has offered incentives for couples that have children, including payouts and free health care. While culture and monetary incentives certainly play a role, there is one piece to this puzzle that is being dangerously overlooked; and it is biochemical.<br><br>Those familiar with the uniquely Japanese phenomenon of hikikomori and herbivore men will clearly see the connection.

Testosterone is the driving force behind a man\u2019s sex drive; It builds muscle, deepens his voice, increases the size of his penis and testes, and motivates him to live life. <br><br>You may be surprised to learn that the modern Japanese diet actually lowers testosterone levels in the body. Phytoestrogens are plant derived compounds found in a wide variety of foods, most notably soy. The body interprets them as estrogen and they have been shown to have a feminizing effect on men while also lowering testosterone levels. The modern Japanese diet is saturated with phytoestrogens in unusually high levels compared to other cultures. Soy beans, tofu, tempeh, miso paste, and every possible derivative of these such as sauces, seasonings, powders, and additives are all high in phytoestrogens and are regularly consumed in Japan. In addition, the regularity at which it is consumed is more significant than simply the raw amount. Take for example daily miso soup for breakfast as a staple in the diet. From birth to death, the average Japanese consumes phytoestrogens on a daily basis. This is especially effective through periods of physical development such as puberty and early in life when hormone regulation is being balanced in the body. Phytoestrogens disrupt the process of not only sexual organ development and masculine physical traits, but also patterns in the brain characteristic of male behavior. Even moderate consumption during pregnancy can have adverse effects on fetal development and puberty later in life. Consider the impact of what is essentially daily and life-long hormone therapy on a culture-wide scale and you begin to realize just how deep the issue is.","filename":"tumblr_l5w6o4Z12B1qc2mugo1_250","ext":".jpg","w":250,"h":350,"tn_w":89,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490714198910,"time":1490714198,"md5":"JJTbu1eiL9C7WQLE0TsjyA==","fsize":41237,"resto":118655764,"id":"LcWX9lHc","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118658309,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)11:17:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118657271\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118657271<\/a><br>heavy weights","time":1490714265,"resto":118655764,"id":"c8mpkQfq","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":118658311,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)11:17:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118658195\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118658195<\/a><br><a href=\"#p118658019\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118658019<\/a><br><a href=\"#p118655764\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118655764<\/a><br><br>The hormone-killing effects of these foods is not a new discovery. More than 2,000 years ago, Chinese monks traditionally consumed tofu on a daily basis to intentionally reduce their sexual drive to assist in their lives of abstinence. But why haven\u2019t we seen the effects of this phenomena in past generations of Japanese? This is because the Japanese diet of today is vastly different from past generations. Major changes such as the move from brown rice to white rice near the beginning of the 18th century marked the beginning of things to come. (Regularly consumed white rice causes spikes in blood sugar, which causes drops in testosterone by an average of 25% after meals.) Post-WWII Japan was introduced to new technologies and methods of mass food production. Not all soy is created equal, and modern industrialized soy products are quite different from the soy of past generations due to these differences in production. Modern soy production creates a product that introduces a whole host of problems for those that regularly consume it. Furthermore, many foods that were consumed in the Japanese diet that promoted testosterone production, are no longer being consumed in the amount or regularity that they once were.","filename":"tumblr_mysezqmabO1t7rguwo1_500","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":750,"tn_w":83,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490714265673,"time":1490714265,"md5":"Br\/isdOEMZwT2yrDF0vUcw==","fsize":76956,"resto":118655764,"id":"LcWX9lHc","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118658320,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)11:17:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118655764\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118655764<\/a><br>Increase sulfur intake<br><br>sulfur binds to excess estrogen and allows the body to remove it","filename":"79 stingray","ext":".jpg","w":1536,"h":800,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":65,"tim":1490714273190,"time":1490714273,"md5":"BAjdF0eM3NZttOwGy7j\/0A==","fsize":253235,"resto":118655764,"id":"lDpJ9+zn","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":118658409,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)11:18:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118658311\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118658311<\/a><br><a href=\"#p118658195\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118658195<\/a><br><a href=\"#p118658019\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118658019<\/a><br><a href=\"#p118655764\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118655764<\/a><br><br>Now Japan finds itself with a population of sexually apathetic, perceptually weak, and skinny men.

Everyone should try to stop masturbating as soon as possible if they&#039;re concerned about their test levels.","time":1490714346,"resto":118655764,"id":"cLOnCnMw","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118658448,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)11:19:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"It&#039;s in pretty much everything except most whole foods.<br><br>Avoid: non-organic corn and corn products (HFCS), soy anything, food stored in cheap plastics (avoid plastic as much as possible), and farmed fish.<br><br>Always remember supporting small scale farming is the traditionalist way, corporate farming is for cuckservatives.","time":1490714350,"resto":118655764,"id":"s7KinlPt","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118658512,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)11:19:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118658409\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118658409<\/a><br><a href=\"#p118658311\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118658311<\/a><br><a href=\"#p118658195\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118658195<\/a><br><a href=\"#p118658019\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118658019<\/a><br><a href=\"#p118655764\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118655764<\/a><br><br>References:<br><br>http:\/\/www.japanprobe.com\/2009\/08\/3<wbr>0\/japanese-women-long-for-samurai-m<wbr>en\/<br>http:\/\/phytoestrogen.com\/<br>http:\/\/darrowmillerandfriends.com\/2<wbr>013\/10\/03\/japan-turing-out-the-ligh<wbr>ts\/<br>http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Popula<wbr>tion_decline#Japan<br>http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/art<wbr>icles\/PMC3074428\/<br>http:\/\/www.webmd.com\/men\/features\/l<wbr>ow-testosterone-explained-how-do-yo<wbr>u-know-when-levels-are-too-low<br>http:\/\/www.onhealth.com\/low_testost<wbr>erone\/article.htm<br>http:\/\/www.dietaryfiberfood.com\/phy<wbr>toestrogen-hormones\/phytoestrogen-f<wbr>ood-sources.php<br>http:\/\/jacktylerperformance.com\/201<wbr>3\/07\/18\/testosterone-10-ways-to-boo<wbr>st-your-manliness\/?relatedposts_exc<wbr>lude=2<br>http:\/\/jacktylerperformance.com\/201<wbr>3\/07\/07\/soy-isnt-a-health-food\/<br>http:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2009\/WORLD\/asiap<wbr>cf\/06\/05\/japan.herbivore.men\/index.<wbr>html?_s=PM:WORLD<br>http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Herbiv<wbr>ore_men<br>http:\/\/www.mayoclinic.org\/healthy-l<wbr>iving\/sexual-health\/in-depth\/testos<wbr>terone-therapy\/art-20045728<br>http:\/\/www.peaktestosterone.com\/Sym<wbr>ptoms.aspx<br>http:\/\/chriskresser.com\/soy-foods-a<wbr>ssociated-with-lower-sperm-counts<br>http:\/\/expressindia.indianexpress.c<wbr>om\/ie\/daily\/19980530\/15050214.html<br>http:\/\/www.tokyoreporter.com\/2012\/0<wbr>9\/27\/japans-first-masturbation-bar-<wbr>for-women-opens-in-shibuya<br>http:\/\/www.asian-nation.org\/interra<wbr>cial.shtml<br>http:\/\/www.peaktestosterone.com\/Tes<wbr>tosterone_Food.aspx<br>http:\/\/www.peaktestosterone.com\/Tes<wbr>tosterone_Glucose.aspx<br>http:\/\/ask.metafilter.com\/149004\/Hi<wbr>story-of-white-not-wholegrain-rice-<wbr>in-Japan<br>http:\/\/www.rense.com\/general75\/fav.<wbr>htm<br>http:\/\/www.nourishingourchildren.or<wbr>g\/Soy.html<br>http:\/\/www.janethull.com\/newsletter<wbr>\/0605\/safesoy.php<br>http:\/\/www.westonaprice.org\/wp-cont<wbr>ent\/uploads\/2000\/01\/trifold-soyaler<wbr>t2010.pdf<br>http:\/\/sexyscience1.wordpress.com\/2<wbr>013\/10\/28\/japans-carnivore-women-an<wbr>d-herbivore-men\/","filename":"8136c96cd3c61df9571981a0b2a3d0c5","ext":".jpg","w":580,"h":772,"tn_w":93,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490714386084,"time":1490714386,"md5":"OCZIz1I9H04Q34+n+CRZ5g==","fsize":90132,"resto":118655764,"id":"LcWX9lHc","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118658581,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)11:20:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118656931\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118656931<\/a><br>The water supply argument is a meme.

When the socialist revolution failed to materialise beyond the Soviet Union, Marxist thinkers like Antonio Gramsci and Georg Lukacs tried to explain why. Their answer was that culture and religion blunted the proletariat\u2019s desire to revolt, and the solution was that Marxists should carry out a \u201clong march through the institutions\u201d \u2013 universities and schools, government bureaucracies and the media \u2013 so that cultural values could be progressively changed from above.<br><br>Adapting this, later thinkers of the Frankfurt School decided that the key to destroying capitalism was to mix up Marx with a bit of Freud, since workers were not only economically oppressed, but made orderly by sexual repression and other social conventions. The problem was not only capitalism as an economic system, but the family, gender hierarchies, normal sexuality \u2013 in short, the whole suite of traditional western values.<br><br>https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/comment<wbr>isfree\/2015\/jan\/19\/cultural-marxism<wbr>-a-uniting-theory-for-rightwingers-<wbr>who-love-to-play-the-victim?CMP=soc<wbr>_567","time":1493409120,"resto":123235212,"id":"JoqmSKSG","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":123236783,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)15:55:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123236394\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123236394<\/a><br>SJWs have nothing to do with the Frankfurt School though.

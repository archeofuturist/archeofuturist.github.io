This is not really a general knowledge, but there are people talking about it. Our mafia\/deep state\/whatever you call it consists of leftovers from commie regime and all people who got rich through privatizations of national property during the transition from communism to capitalism.<br><br>The party that ruled for the last 2 terms (8 years) is directly in their hands, to the point where they were choosing the president - Donald Tusk, recently re-elected President of EU, was forced to opt out of the Polish presidental race in favour of Bronis\u0142aw Komorowski, who was less ambitious and more of a puppet to our &quot;deep mafia&quot;. We also have a lot of obvious EU\/Jewish influences; 4th biggest party is their direct puppet and we also have clearly EU-sponsored legit commies who luckily didn&#039;t get into our parliament.<br><br>You&#039;d think that Kaczy\u0144ski and his Law and Justice, often described as &quot;far right&quot;, would be out of the influence, but no. He&#039;s decently out of the EU influence, but not out of the influence of our &quot;mafia&quot;. In this regard, he&#039;s a controlled opposition that still knows their limits and what to do and what not.<br><br>But I digress. Back to Polish mafia\/deep state. Like I said, these guys operate like mafia; they are concerned about making money. Any way is fine, they&#039;re outside of the law and everyone covers up for them. There was one prominent politician, Andrzej Lepper, who tried to uncover some of their crimes publicly, he eventually committed suicide; in months preceding his death a few of his close associates committed suicide as well. This is not an isolated case at all either. If they can do this for money, why not child trafficking? Just another business to them.","time":1491814697,"resto":120408707,"id":"KxTPnm\/X","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":120416180,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)05:00:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120415649\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120415649<\/a><br>look here idiot, and its old data<br>https:\/\/www.nik.gov.pl\/en\/news\/nik-<wbr>on-missing-persons-search.html<br><br>its a quite big town per year","time":1491814858,"resto":120408707,"id":"m+l\/qYN9","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":120416347,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)05:03:23","name":"Anonymous","filename":"playing connect the dots","ext":".png","w":1681,"h":6531,"tn_w":32,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491815003836,"time":1491815003,"md5":"qSmH4TCsqffYJxubDgdoaw==","fsize":940041,"resto":120408707,"id":"sItR4ZZL","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":120417922,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)05:24:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120416347\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120416347<\/a><br>what the fuck","time":1491816265,"resto":120408707,"id":"EoXHgF3T","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":120418106,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)05:26:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120415985\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120415985<\/a><br>Thank you anon, that&#039;s a good read and quite scary, not all is what it seems.<br><br>Here take this picture","filename":"Verdon Gorge, France (Provence)","ext":".jpg","w":5135,"h":3327,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":80,"tim":1491816405547,"time":1491816405,"md5":"gbQ+j\/upJw2CyyxiwMkphQ==","fsize":1383779,"resto":120408707,"id":"EoXHgF3T","country":"NL","m_img":1,"country_name":"Netherlands"}]}

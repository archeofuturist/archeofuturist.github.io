At some point, you realize you created a democracy or an oligarchy or some kind of monarchy or whatever system you call statist, because thats exactly how things developed with humanity: we tried to fix society over and over and over and over but we never get it completely flawless, so we add another institution, another law and another moral rule, but nowhere but the most remote, the most desolate or the most native places you find anything resembling anarchy.

I like factcist, it explains the basic idea well enough. Our shared ideology is based on learning the truth even if it goes against our own beliefs. That is why people within our group believe very different things and yet we are part of a shared culture and belief system.<br><br>It&#039;s fairly memeable. It is similar to facist so you can have some fun with the far left. An example, someone could add a small ct to antifacist posters or graffiti.

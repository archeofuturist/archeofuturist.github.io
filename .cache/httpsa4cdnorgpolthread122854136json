I like factcist, it explains the basic idea well enough. Our shared ideology is based on learning the truth even if it goes against our own beliefs. That is why people within our group believe very different things and yet we are part of a shared culture and belief system.<br><br>It&#039;s fairly memeable. It is similar to facist so you can have some fun with the far left. An example, someone could add a small ct to antifacist posters or graffiti. And you can run circles around most libtards. &quot;What&#039;s wrong with a fact based ideology? Please explain your theisis&quot;<br><br>So what do ya think? Factcist or do you believe you might have a better idea.","filename":"tmp_23825-1489212188688427296340","ext":".png","w":1139,"h":898,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":197,"tim":1493188390393,"time":1493188390,"md5":"QwuDuHaVDU8WYDLZUfDkUg==","fsize":542831,"resto":0,"id":"yECkIJ+x","country":"GB","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"what-would-you-plke-us-to-be-called","trip":"!!CQPc1P7ffmq","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":3,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":122854292,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)02:34:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122854136\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122854136<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Our shared ideology is based on learning the truth even if it goes against our own beliefs<\/span><br><br>except thats not even close to correct. the amount of motivated reasoning on this board is unprecedented.","time":1493188496,"resto":122854136,"id":"Hh1nTgQ\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122854653,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)02:39:16","name":"Factcist","com":"<a href=\"#p122854292\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122854292<\/a><br>This board is unmoderated and full of shills, libtards trying to convert us.

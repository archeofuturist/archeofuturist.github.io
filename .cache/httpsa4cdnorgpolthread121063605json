Why? Because beauty inspires the human being, it anoints the soul itself and creates a desire in people to search for a meaning and to create beauty themselves, not only in form of paintings or buildings, but in their very actions as people. That&#039;s what the Jews want to prevent, since it helps people not only to gain strength but also to maintain it. They can&#039;t rule over the goyim if those are strong with fire in their heart. That&#039;s why degeneration of society and the glorification of repulsive filth is being overall pushed. The Jew want to kill beauty and purity, because he is the embodiment of ugliness and corruption. Anything built by them should be torn down, nearly all the leading figures in modern art are Jews if not all.","time":1492180779,"resto":121063605,"id":"a7z7jwgK","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":121067089,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)10:39:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121063605\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121063605<\/a><br>we must build statues to kek","time":1492180790,"resto":121063605,"id":"sSdksVk7","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121067260,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)10:41:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121067066\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121067066<\/a><br>jeez dude you didn&#039;t hvae to swallow the whole bottle of redpills.","time":1492180897,"resto":121063605,"id":"2OTgktt9","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":121067367,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)10:42:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121066996\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121066996<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;capitalism exist since 100 years<\/span><br>No one said or implied that.

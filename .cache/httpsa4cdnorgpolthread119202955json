The Federal Reserve is what is called a &quot;Reserve Bank,&quot; which you might have heard of in introduction to Macroeconomics.<br><br>Okay, so every year the Federal Government passes what is called a &quot;Spending Bill,&quot; which details where all of the funding from the Federal Government is going to be appropriated, and how much those appropriations will be. Follow me so far?<br><br>Well, when the Spending Bill passes, the Federal Government hands out that money as detailed in the bill. But wait, where did the money come from?<br>&quot;Taxes,&quot; you, a fool, might answer.<br><br>But in fact, it comes from the Federal Reserve in the form of a loan, because taxes for the year haven&#039;t been collected yet. This loan covers the entire federal budget for the year, and comes with an interest rate of between 6 and 11%.<br><br>This budget, with interest, is then paid back over the course of the year using Federal Taxes.<br><br>So let&#039;s review. The Federal Reserve, which is privately owned, collects back about 108% of the entire federal budget every year. How much is 8% of the US federal budget? Well, last year it was $319,920,000,000.<br><br>That interest was scooped up by the Federal Reserve either as debt the US government now owes them, or in hard cash. That&#039;s profit. Every penny of it is now theirs.<br><br>Congratulations, now you know why no amount of taxation ever seems to solve &quot;wealth inequality.&quot; It&#039;s because all taxes objectively serve to enrich this small clique of bankers, who howl with laughter each time some bonehead like Bernie Sanders talks about paying &quot;your fair share.&quot; Every penny of it goes into their pockets.","filename":"9a1ebd0fe24e3723902f30420e4f14f0","ext":".jpg","w":564,"h":736,"tn_w":95,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491146730515,"time":1491146730,"md5":"L\/FZKZa8ysxXSbpGLxbx\/g==","fsize":82852,"resto":119202955,"id":"q\/Lw5s1I","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119209837,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)11:25:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119209576\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119209576<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;Wanting to dictate public morality makes you no better than an SJW. <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;implying i give a shit<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;embrace and accept peoples&#039; personal agency<\/span><br>fuck them, a traitour is a traitour","time":1491146756,"resto":119202955,"id":"yWpbOCrw","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":119209844,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)11:26:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119202955\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119202955<\/a><br>I don&#039;t believe that headline it seems more made up then the homeless numbers spewed by the media in the 80d and 90s where the guy that did the &quot;study&quot; they based all these numbers off of admitted he made all the numbers up on what he &quot;thought was about right&quot; for the number of homeless people<br>I want to see their methodology and sources.<br>Pro tip they&#039;re full of shit because people have already shown these as full of shit<br>The bottom half of the world alone buys more value in peanuts just peanuts than what these &quot;8 richest men&quot; have in total value<br><br>http:\/\/tomwoods.com\/ep-876-the-ineq<wbr>uality-hucksters\/","time":1491146760,"resto":119202955,"id":"lKubdD3X","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119209956,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)11:27:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119202955\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119202955<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;ITT, socialists don&#039;t understand natural logarithms<\/span>","time":1491146836,"resto":119202955,"id":"tnWR3ESh","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119210060,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)11:28:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119202955\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119202955<\/a><br>How are you and your baltic friends nations?

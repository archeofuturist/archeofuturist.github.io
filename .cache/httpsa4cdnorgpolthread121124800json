That way, if US attacks, they will be at war with China.<br><br>North Korea is given no choice but to allow tens of thousands of Chinese troops to occupy sites of importance around North Korea.<br>Signal is given, and Chinese forces decapitate NK regime and bribe NK generals to stand down. China begins administration and redevelopment of NK.<br><br>South Korea and Japan are spared from NK artillery and missiles that would otherwise kill thousands of civilians, and their governments accept the idea that having China in control of North Korea is better than having a spoilt brat running it.<br><br>In exchange for the rest of the world acknowledging Chinese authority over NK, China will give up its claims to the tiny islands of the South China Sea and the Senkakus. This pacifies the Philipines, Taiwan, Vietnam, Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Japan. Chinese naval forces will still enjoy freedom of navigation through SCS, and now has made friends with all the regional players, who will accept China&#039;s continued rise as a force for good.","filename":"Hourglass 1","ext":".png","w":1280,"h":720,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1492209093694,"time":1492209093,"md5":"DTwtWnVIEWdOZ2F7xAzw2g==","fsize":550107,"resto":0,"id":"EeluFjIJ","country":"NZ","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"securing-peace-for-the-next-100-years","country_name":"New Zealand","replies":5,"images":2,"unique_ips":4},{"no":121124876,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)18:32:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"MEANWHILE, IN RUSSIA<br><br>Tillerson meets Putin in Moscow, proposes NK plan.<br>In exchange for Russia going along with the NK plan, the US and its allies will recognise Russian sovereignty over Crimea, and NATO will pull back its deployed forces to Poland, along with a new arms reduction treaty.

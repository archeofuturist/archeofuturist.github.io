You have to spread memes.<br>Look at this and then read those considerations:<br>- Macron has been voted by the majoriry of the wealthiest. This because he is rich itself and reflects the will of the wealthiests.<br>- The wealthiests are a minority (more than \u20ac 3,500)<br>- Hollande&#039;s presidency has been considered one of the worst ever and it would be extremely contradictory to vote for Macron who has been a minister in Hollande&#039;s government.<br>- Macron program is extremely weak: he doesn&#039;t even show to have a realistic and coherent solution or plan for French issues. (for example: &quot;\u2018Terrorism will be part of our daily lives for years to come&quot;, Macron)<br>- Nicolas Dupont-Aignan (right wing), who achieved 5% in the first-round vote, shared alot of ideas with MLP endorsed MLP and it&#039;s reasonable to think that his electorate will vote for MLP.<br>- A huge amount of vote in every salary group were for M\u00e9lenchon and Fillion.<br>- M\u00e9lenchon and Fillion ideas and programs are much more similar to MLP ones than Macron&#039;s: Fillion policy clearly belongs to the right wing and M\u00e9lenchon program shared alot of ideas with MLP one (see the image in the first reply).<br>- Voters are much more conditioned by ideas than candidates&#039; endorsements.<br>- In fact, Fillion has been heavily criticised for endorsing Macron.<br>- Interviews have shown M\u00e9lenchon voters more inclined to vote for MLP or to abstain than voting Macron.<br>- Agreement for MLP is growing every day, not only on social networks.<br><br>See: http:\/\/www.politologue.com\/ and Fillon&#039;s page in which actually no one is saying that he will vote for the ex-banker Rotchild financed Macron.<br><br>Don&#039;t surrender, spread memes for the power of the KEK.","filename":"IMG (3)","ext":".jpg","w":753,"h":496,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":82,"tim":1493754366241,"time":1493754366,"md5":"j9oHXlLRP2bQNaa3RvZwmw==","fsize":112363,"resto":123774573,"id":"7dMfKrzb","country":"IT","country_name":"Italy"},{"no":123809501,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)15:47:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123791426\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123791426<\/a><br><a href=\"#p123791503\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123791503<\/a><br><a href=\"#p123791596\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123791596<\/a><br><a href=\"#p123791676\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123791676<\/a><br><a href=\"#p123791694\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123791694<\/a><br><a href=\"#p123791757\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123791757<\/a><br><a href=\"#p123791850\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123791850<\/a><br><a href=\"#p123791968\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123791968<\/a><br><a href=\"#p123792361\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123792361<\/a><br>This.

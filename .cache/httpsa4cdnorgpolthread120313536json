A communist system would thus free individuals from alienation in the sense of having one&#039;s life structured around survival (making a wage or salary in a capitalist system), which Marx referred to as a transition from the &quot;realm of necessity&quot; to the &quot;realm of freedom.&quot; As a result, a communist society is envisioned as being composed of an intellectually-inclined population with both the time and resources to pursue its creative hobbies and genuine interests, and to contribute to creative social wealth in this manner. Karl Marx considered &quot;true richness&quot; to be the amount of time one has at his or her disposal to pursue one&#039;s creative passions.

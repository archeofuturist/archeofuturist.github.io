A communist system would thus free individuals from alienation in the sense of having one&#039;s life structured around survival (making a wage or salary in a capitalist system), which Marx referred to as a transition from the &quot;realm of necessity&quot; to the &quot;realm of freedom.&quot; As a result, a communist society is envisioned as being composed of an intellectually-inclined population with both the time and resources to pursue its creative hobbies and genuine interests, and to contribute to creative social wealth in this manner. Karl Marx considered &quot;true richness&quot; to be the amount of time one has at his or her disposal to pursue one&#039;s creative passions.

Instances of instability include the Great Depression (1929-1941) and the Great Recession since 2008, plus eleven &quot;downturns&quot; in the US between those two global collapses. Each time, millions lost jobs, misery soared, poverty worsened and massive resources were wasted. Leaders promised that their &quot;reforms&quot; would prevent such instability from recurring. Those promises were not kept. Reforms did not work or did not endure. The system was, and remains, the problem.<br><br>Inequality likewise proved to be an inherent trend of capitalism. Only occasionally and temporarily did opposition from its victims stop or reverse it. Income and wealth inequalities have worsened in almost every capitalist country since at least the 1970s. Today we have returned to the huge 19th-century-sized gaps between the richest 1 percent and everyone else. Rescuing the &quot;disappearing middle class&quot; has become every aspiring politician&#039;s slogan.

When the crash happened, the government under hoover did massive amounts of government spending, tax increases, government programs and regulations, this continued and got expanded under FDR. They literally forced farmers to burn their own crops for fuck sakes.<br>The great depression actually ended AFTER WW2 when the US government decided to drastically cut taxes, spending and some of the new deal programs FDR put in. This same year this happened was the most economically productive year in american history and lead the way to the post war boom.","time":1491785525,"resto":120313536,"id":"TmKZ\/bjX","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120366457,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)20:52:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120366040\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120366040<\/a><br>But did the system completely fail the way communism has just as many times?","time":1491785553,"resto":120313536,"id":"\/01+KLZm","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120366575,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)20:53:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"Capitalism is unstable and will fail, probably in the next 20 years.

In a free market with free banking and a naturally DEFLATIONARY currency. As production and automation increases, prices for capital and consumer goods fall. People would need to work less hours to get the money they need to have a comfortable life. Many more people would be working part time, like 2-3 days a week which would only open up slots for more people to work. Also people would be retiring much earlier which also decreases unemployment. As the price of capital goods falls it creates a massive high paying service sector industry that will create countless jobs. There would be no unemployment. Leftists whine that manufacturing jobs will disappear, SO WHAT? There&#039;s always new service sector jobs and they will pay more and more since these firms will be profitable.<br><br>Do you have any refutation to this or are you going to just post more images.<br><br>Let&#039;s see lol","time":1491785920,"resto":120313536,"id":"TmKZ\/bjX","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120367247,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)20:58:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120366833\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120366833<\/a><br>Face it leaf, it&#039;s collapsing as we speak, the ratio of public funding vs private funding is the smallest ever.

The last 20 years as the internet has gotten bigger and information has spread people have gotten louder and more partisan but strangely enough less educated and informed. We&#039;ve lost the ability to be impartial and respect what people who disagree with us ideologically think. Also minorities are just stupid as a whole and are buying the idea that whites are trying to oppress them so they are trying their hardest to turn the US into a failed South American state.

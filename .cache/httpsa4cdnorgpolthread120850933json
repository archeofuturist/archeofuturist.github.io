Most of the time if law enforcement is giving you an order, whether it&#039;s lawful or not, you kind of have to assume it is - If you comply, you can fight it in court. If you don&#039;t and then fight back, the police department can use that against you even if you were right. <br><br>He&#039;s clearly in a situation where guys wearing &quot;police&quot; telling you to get off a plane is not going to end with him staying on that plane. That will never, ever happen in a million years. The dispute he has is civil, 100%. It doesn&#039;t give him any additional rights beyond that.<br><br>The proper way to &quot;refuse&quot; a lawful order is non-compliance but allowing them to use the minimal force necessary to remove you. For example, if a said he is going to search you, and you 100% knew it was illegal, you would then say you don&#039;t consent. If the cop then starts searching your pockets you aren&#039;t supposed to push him away, you let him do that shit and then sue them later. In his case, he can say he doesn&#039;t want to leave, but the second they place their hand on your shoulder you get up and let them guide you wherever the fuck you are going. <br><br>Typically tho any lawyer would tell you to comply with any order you are given, and verbally state you do not consent, you do not believe their instruction is lawful, etc - while still doing it. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;He wasn&#039;t under arrest<\/span><br>He was detained at that point and fighting back.

There&#039;s no argument over the choice between peace and political terrorism, but there&#039;s only one guaranteed way you can have peace - and you can have it in the next second - surrender. Admittedly, there&#039;s a risk in any course we follow other than this, but every lesson of history tells us that the greater risk lies in appeasement, and this is the specter our well-meaning general public refuses to face - that their policy of accommodation is appeasement, and it gives no choice between peace and armed resistance, only between fight or surrender. And what then Richard Kalergi has told his people he knows what our answer will be? He has told them that we&#039;re retreating under the shadow of the Second World War, and someday when the time comes to deliver the final ultimatum, our surrender will be voluntary, because by that time we will have been weakened from within racially, spiritually, morally, and economically. He believes this because from our side he&#039;s heard voices pleading for &quot;peace at any price&quot;. If we continue to accommodate, continue to back and retreat, eventually we have to face the final demand - the ultimatum. I know and do not believe that life is so dear and peace so sweet as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery. If nothing in life is worth dying for, when did this begin - just in the face of this (((enemy)))? Or should Moses have told the children of Israel to live in slavery under the pharaohs? Should Christ have refused the cross? Should the patriots at The Battle of Bannockburn have thrown down their swords and refused to advance heard around the world? The martyrs of history were not fools, and our honoured dead who gave their lives to stop the advance of the English didn&#039;t die in vain. Where, then, is the road to our survival? Well it&#039;s a simple answer after all.","filename":"IMG_1369","ext":".jpg","w":3000,"h":2345,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":97,"tim":1490901342064,"time":1490901342,"md5":"\/kDmOUqjgBDsSTrNMHHK0w==","fsize":1202069,"resto":118953766,"id":"hXeNseXo","country":"IL","m_img":1,"trip":"!JMd0ZJc1Sc","country_name":"Israel"},{"no":118955170,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)15:16:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a

But I need some help, I&#039;m a fourth year Aerospace Engineering student, and I want to do my civic duty as an American and become more politically educated so I can defend my personal Ideology. I am a white conservative\/grandson of a Cuban immigrant. I voted for Trump, I listen to Ben Shapiro&#039;s podcast, and I have read Ann Coulter&#039;s Immigration book. I&#039;m against Immigration ( or I at least want to slow the rate of immigrants we take in so our immigrants have time to assimilate), I believe taxes should be lower (capital,income, gains, etc..), I think abortion is fucked up, SJWs are asking to not be held accountable for crimes, I&#039;m a proponent of the 2nd amendment (and all amendments), and I think that America has a moral obligation as the country with the largest and most advanced military to uphold global law and order. I&#039;d like to be able to defend these positions, and as such I would like any recommendations for books, papers, articles, videos, statistics, and anything and everything to arm myself to stand up to people who foster hateful liberal rhetoric. I live in a city where 70% of the population is liberal, and its really annoying when I tell people my stance and try and argue it and get immediately shut down by their typical responses.

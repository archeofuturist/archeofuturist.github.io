Deep down I had hoped we were all wrong. We aren&#039;t. This interview is from a man that worked as close to the top of the pyramid as anyone. The 8,000 that run this planet dealt with him daily. <br><br>The documentary will anger you but it will confirm what we&#039;ve thought. It confirms ALL OF IT. The first ten minutes is kind of boring but sit through it, so you&#039;ll understand this man and what he did. The last fifteen minutes will absolutely crush you and confirm what we&#039;ve known about our world all along. This is the one red pill that has fully convinced me. Please pass this within your circles and have your friends and family watch. People need to know.

It has changed me. Just seeing this man&#039;s sincerity. <br><br>He worked for the elite as a strawman, dealing with money for pretty much the leaders of the planet. He goes into detail how he got the job, what he did in Iraq after a boycott there (it was one example of one of the things he did, to try and give some substance of his job). He then goes on to talk about how he grew a conscious after being asked by these people to attend a Luciferian service. He didn&#039;t know what it was and was laughing at the people and how they were naked etc. They then brought out children to sacrifice. He pretty much left went back to work and refused assignments dealing with these people. Then had a nervous breakdown. <br><br>You really should watch it anon. I&#039;ve left alot out and he WILL convince you.

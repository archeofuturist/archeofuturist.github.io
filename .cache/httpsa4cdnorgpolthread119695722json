For example if you take a philosophy course-- a real philosophy course, not muh gender issues in the 21st century-- you will learn how to formulate coherent, logical arguments. You will learn about logical fallacies which will help you a) avoid them and b) notice when other people use them to try and argue against a point without really addressing it. This trend of thinking logically is also found in mathematics and computer science (hint: programming is not computer science), where you will learn to prove more abstract concepts like theorems using rigorous logical methods. Further philosophy courses will have you evaluating the logical arguments of others, figuring out what tricks and fallacies they might be employing to convince you of what they believe, or figuring out what fallacious traps they fell into themselves without realizing, or even deciding for yourself that their arguments are entirely reasonable. You should be able to take a supportive or critical position on the philosophers whose works you read.<br><br>The problem is that in practice, colleges end up being liberal groupthink indoctrination centers: what at first glance seems like a &quot;free thinking&quot; discussion ends up being &quot;think how we tell you to think&quot;. The young naive college student might think they are having an open and interesting discussion where there are no wrong answers when in reality the professor\/teaching assistant is leading the class to think a certain way about a certain topic. They will steer the conversation in certain directions and shut down certain topics of debate that disagree with their worldview. Eventually the rest of the class will start to agree and similarly steer their own discussions in the same way. Now you have a bunch of trained monkeys programmed to think a specific way about a certain topic and they will go out and coach others to think the same thing they do.","time":1491452504,"resto":119695722,"id":"8CwAkXoz","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119704113,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)00:23:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119703959\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119703959<\/a><br>\/thread","time":1491452590,"resto":119695722,"id":"oOgZ\/q\/E","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":119704178,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)00:23:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119702791\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119702791<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Zooms in on handwriting<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&#039;Nigel Faragh&#039; <\/span><br><br>Does this mean Nige confirmed Mudslime?","filename":"1449117582378","ext":".png","w":241,"h":228,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":118,"tim":1491452636721,"time":1491452636,"md5":"j34tEzI8A\/QGGhgYwcth8g==","fsize":74663,"resto":119695722,"id":"7AiGbN56","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119704255,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)00:24:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119703613\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119703613<\/a><br>What&#039;s a blue pilled fag like you doing here anyways?

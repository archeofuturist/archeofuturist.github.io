As a Canadian physician, I can say it&#039;s not the government that&#039;s causing the shortage of doctors. There are a few reasons:<br><br>1. Shortages are largely for primary care in rural and remote communities. Most young doctors want to live in a big city because that&#039;s what young professionals prefer and despite heavy financial incentives to go rural or remote, we still struggle to find people willing to go.<br>2. Physicians in Canada are self-regulating professionals. The number of medical trainees each year is determined by our professional associations. While there are some programs that cannot increase capacity because of particular shortages in sub-specialties. For example, every psychiatry resident must do a geriatric psychiatry rotation, but we have a limited number of geriatric psychiatrists able to train new residents, so that&#039;s where the bottleneck. The other reason is that our professional associations function as a powerful union and it is in our interest to keep numbers low to keep pay high.<br>3. Ultimately, our need to keep pay high is largely driven by cross-border competition with the United States. We are paid on average more than American doctors, but there are some individuals in some specialties who would likely move to the United States if they were paid less than they are. European doctors are paid even less than Canadian doctors.<br><br>The high wages of doctors is actually a significant contributor to increased health expenditures. I personally think Canada would be better served by more doctors who are paid less, but that&#039;s not a popular opinion among doctors here, for obvious reasons.","time":1490908686,"resto":118966297,"id":"fNCWiuNV","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118971343,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)17:28:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118969395\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118969395<\/a><br>We are, but that probably has more to do with the far greater inequality you experience in America. Americans can expect to live two years less than Canadians, with 30% higher infant mortality, and twice as much HIV\/AIDS. This is despite the fact that your healthcare expenditures are over 50% higher than ours are per capita. There are still many rich Canadians who opt to go to the United States for state of the art treatment, but in many cases they would have been just as well served in an academic tertiary hospital in a major Canadian city. Hospitals vary in quality, but there are some Canadian hospitals that can absolutely compete with top American hospitals for high quality care. <br><br>This is not to say that the Canadian healthcare system is without it&#039;s own issues. &quot;Free&quot; healthcare means that we have far too many people showing up at the ER for complaints better addressed by their family physician or at a walk-in clinic. Wait times are consequently long and average about 4 hours. Wait times for particular surgeries and shit like MRIs are much longer in Canada than in the United States. That said, critical surgeries are done in a timely manner. Of course, every patient feels their surgery is critical, and nobody likes to get bumped down the list, but we have to triage. Up to a third of our systemic costs are for the last year of end-of-life care and family members often push for aggressive and drastic measures to prolong the lives of their loved ones. These measures often diminish the patient&#039;s quality of life significantly, cause suffering, and are often incredibly expensive, but expensive to the system, not to the patient or the family.","time":1490909312,"resto":118966297,"id":"fNCWiuNV","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118971938,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)17:33:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118968445\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118968445<\/a><br>United States treating medicare as a for profit business steals our doctors while ballooning their healthcare costs.","time":1490909584,"resto":118966297,"id":"GSon\/uQ4","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118972473,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)17:37:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"I have cholesterol crystals in my gal bladder.

Obviously money is a major motive for anyone but for most physicians, that&#039;s not as important as other concerns. There&#039;d be no shortage of aspiring physicians even if we were paid at the level of European doctors. Canadian medical schools routinely reject qualified applicants. Despite offering massive financial incentives to motivate doctors to move to areas with shortages, doctors are still reluctant to move, because it&#039;s not just about money. At the end of the day, America is facing the same issue as Canada with a lack of primary care coverage in rural and remote regions of the country. Fact is that doctors like to live in cities.<br><br>American healthcare expenditures are uniquely high and they also vary geographically within America for reasons that make almost no market sense. It&#039;s likely that both Canada and America would have decreased health costs if America moved to a single payer healthcare system like Trump wanted to do before his 2016 ticket. <br><br><a href=\"#p118972906\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118972906<\/a><br>That would depend on the demographic of white Europeans you got.

The nice thing about single-payer healthcare is it&#039;s easier to deal with public health issues like infectious disease. In America, your ghettos are like reservoirs for HIV, so that any vulnerable black or white guy who takes up a heroin habit after getting fired from his factory job ends up getting HIV as well.","time":1490910861,"resto":118966297,"id":"fNCWiuNV","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118974483,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)17:55:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"https:\/\/www.fraserinstitute.org\/stu<wbr>dies\/sustainability-of-health-care-<wbr>spending-in-canada-2017<br><br>Take a look at this<br>Compared to the rest of the *universal healthcare* countries we fucking suck. <br>Every Canadian says &gt;but muh murica but we should be comparing ourselves to everyone with universal healthcare.","time":1490910944,"resto":118966297,"id":"Cw2F3\/GD","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118974657,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)17:57:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"Everything is free except medications and dentist and eye doctor.

Our health expenditures are higher than most continental European nations and yet we achieve comparable health outcomes. Much of this has to do with the fact that Canadian doctors and nurses are paid about 50% more than their European counterparts. The reason it makes sense to compare ourselves to America though is that the brain drain is one of the reasons we have to pay Canadian doctors more than European doctors. Also, we have more similar lifestyles and rates of obesity to America than to Europe. <br><br>The article you listed is making a basic extrapolation of healthcare expenditures, but I can tell you that it&#039;s going to get worse before it gets better because our Baby Boomers are hitting the wall and they&#039;re going to all start falling apart. We don&#039;t have nearly enough long -term care facilities to accommodate them yet. Thankfully, Trudeau identified this problem in his campaign, and I hope to fuck he sticks to his promise. One the Baby Boomers have all croaked, our health budget will be able to breathe a little easier, but before then, I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if we saw tax increases to pay for Baby Boomer end-of-life care. <br><br>I&#039;m hoping that since we now have physician-assisted suicide legislation, that our culture as a whole will shift more toward the idea of a dignified death rather than a prolonged course in the ICU with little hope of recovery and then dying painfully as a doctor crushes your chest in with CPR because neither the patient or the patient&#039;s family signed a do-not-resuscitate order. Don&#039;t get me wrong, physician-assisted suicide in a single-payer healthcare system does introduce some fucking dangerous incentives, so it must really be done carefully.","time":1490911548,"resto":118966297,"id":"fNCWiuNV","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118975676,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)18:05:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118975495\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118975495<\/a><br>Taxes.

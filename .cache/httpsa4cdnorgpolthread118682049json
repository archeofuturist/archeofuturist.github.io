According to a report by the Irish Independent, Communications Minister Denis Naughten is devising plans to broaden the reach of the licence fee to help raise more cash for national broadcaster RTE. <br>The paper&#039;s sources said the EUR 160 annual fee would apply to electronic devices with screen sizes above 11 inches. This would ensure mobile phones and standard tablets are exempt but would see most desktop computers, laptops and large iPads targeted. Each household would only have to pay for one licence, regardless of the number of devices. <br><br>According to figures compiled by An Post, which administers the TV licence fee, some 32,555 households have no TV. This is a rise of nearly 4,000 in a single year. <br><br>The current law exempts devices receiving TV over the internet. Naughten reportedly hopes to delete this exemption using his ministerial powers. By extending the fee to more devices, the government aims to avoid increasing the amount of the licence. <br>&quot;","time":1490744891,"resto":118682049,"id":"LhjUm+GV","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"},{"no":118716677,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)19:48:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118716053\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118716053<\/a><br>Her maiden name is Kelly funnily enough.","time":1490744909,"resto":118682049,"id":"oipAWy9S","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"},{"no":118716738,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)19:48:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118716148\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118716148<\/a><br>They can fuck off anyway.

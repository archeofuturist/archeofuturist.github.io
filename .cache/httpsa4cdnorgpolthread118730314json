Expecting soldiers to execute dissidents will at some point come to that kind of scenario. If you claim that the army will put down all rebels, then you claim that soldiers will gleefully ventilate their friends and family.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In the past <\/span><br>So probably not relevant anymore.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I&#039;m not going to get into hypotheticals about unarmed people fighting highly equipped military force<\/span><br>It&#039;s not even that. We&#039;re talking about the ability for a force to make war on the people giving it the ability to make war.","time":1490769540,"resto":118730314,"id":"FDTOmbH3","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":118757650,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)02:42:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118757258\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118757258<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Not if the benefits aren&#039;t worth the cost<\/span><br>According to you, they are.

It&#039;s actually a very interesting read and puts a lot of thinks into a perspective that makes Europe looks pretty dope I have to say.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The United States, by contrast, hardly trades with most of these countries, and thus it lacks the capacity to levy effective sanctions on its own.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;For example, Washington sanctioned Tehran continuously for 35 years with little effect. After Europe signed on to tough sanctions in 2013, Iran agreed to a nuclear deal within two years.<\/span><br>I didn&#039;t know that.<br><br>The article makes the prediction that - when the EU manages to get over the Euro crisis and Euroskeptic parties don&#039;t get to power - it will be the most influential power in the world for decades to come. Being ahead of the US and way ahead of China and Russia.<br>It furthermore states that the EU is quite stable despite what it may look like from the outside since there are tons of institutions that keep it working even when there is fundamental disagreement among its member states.<br>Even militarily the Europe isn&#039;t such a fad the article states:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;During the past decade, European deployments have averaged 107,000 soldiers per year on land, plus a considerable naval presence. By contrast, China has deployed almost no combat soldiers abroad, and India has done so only within U.N. missions.<\/span><br><br>Thoughts? What part of the EU need to be scrapped so that it works better while we can still keep our footprint on the world?<br>Please bump this thread, it&#039;s a 10min read.","filename":"1493216778083","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":515,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493317475973,"time":1493317475,"md5":"oZoOLmTeITvlLo7DK7bQFQ==","fsize":140427,"resto":0,"id":"t5sv+9O5","country":"DE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"eu-is-a-foreign-policy-superpower","country_name":"Germany","replies":3,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":123069630,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)14:45:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123067190\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123067190<\/a><br>someone bump?","time":1493318739,"resto":123067190,"id":"t5sv+9O5","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":123069815,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)14:47:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"Bumping non slide thread","time":1493318825,"resto":123067190,"id":"SvWPDsGa","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123070636,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)14:53:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"Are you surprised the biggest trade bloc in the world is actually more powerful than \/pol\/ makes it out to be?","time":1493319232,"resto":123067190,"id":"FjAmAAue","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"}]}

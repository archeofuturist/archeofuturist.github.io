Russia&#039;s primary objective is regaining wealth and reversing the decline of their economy, population, culture, etc. They&#039;re fighting for survival, and don&#039;t care who they ally with, so long as they get something good out of it. They don&#039;t like US dominance, only insomuch as it has a tendency to get in their way. They&#039;re pretty agnostic about the world stage. <br><br>Iran actively hates most of the world. Hates the United States mostly for our cultural degeneracy that we have spread throughout the world. Our current mode of imperialism is exporting culture so that our businesses can move in and the globalists can make money, get a bigger slice of the pie. Of course, whenever you invent a weapon, your enemies will have it within a generation. Now, through identity politics and critical theory, other cultures can start importing their culture into the United States. Iran is one of the major proponents of this process, as their goal is theocratic domination. In this regard, Russia and Iran are enemies. Russia intensely hates the Muslim influence in Chechnya and the Asian &quot;provinces&quot;. Don&#039;t forget that Islamic expansion made major advances into the Russian Orthodox territory, not just agaisnt the Roman Church. For many Russians, the ensuing culture is alien, and they want it out. This is a very tense subject though, as Islam survived the soviet system better, being further from Moscow and the gulag system. Lack of organization also helped immensely compared to the church. In dealing with Iran, Russia helps calm internal tensions. It can only go so far, though, because this population is a major piece of Iranian policy. When the muslim identity of these territories supercedes the &#039;russian&#039; identity, Iran will be able to do the same thing to Russia that Russia has done to Georgia and Turkey.","time":1491335912,"resto":119496163,"id":"dWN6PZCf","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119508629,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)15:58:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119507825\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119507825<\/a><br><br>I&#039;ll break it down very simply.<br><br>This whole entire debacle boils down to lines being obfuscated because the narrative was challenged.

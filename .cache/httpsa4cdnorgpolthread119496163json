Hates the United States mostly for our cultural degeneracy that we have spread throughout the world. Our current mode of imperialism is exporting culture so that our businesses can move in and the globalists can make money, get a bigger slice of the pie. Of course, whenever you invent a weapon, your enemies will have it within a generation. Now, through identity politics and critical theory, other cultures can start importing their culture into the United States. Iran is one of the major proponents of this process, as their goal is theocratic domination. In this regard, Russia and Iran are enemies. Russia intensely hates the Muslim influence in Chechnya and the Asian &quot;provinces&quot;. Don&#039;t forget that Islamic expansion made major advances into the Russian Orthodox territory, not just agaisnt the Roman Church. For many Russians, the ensuing culture is alien, and they want it out. This is a very tense subject though, as Islam survived the soviet system better, being further from Moscow and the gulag system. Lack of organization also helped immensely compared to the church. In dealing with Iran, Russia helps calm internal tensions. It can only go so far, though, because this population is a major piece of Iranian policy. When the muslim identity of these territories supercedes the &#039;russian&#039; identity, Iran will be able to do the same thing to Russia that Russia has done to Georgia and Turkey.","time":1491335912,"resto":119496163,"id":"dWN6PZCf","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119508629,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)15:58:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119507825\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119507825<\/a><br><br>I&#039;ll break it down very simply.<br><br>This whole entire debacle boils down to lines being obfuscated because the narrative was challenged.

When people lack solid information, when chaos abounds, people fall back on local and primal relationships--friends and neighbors. The strategy you propose would not actually work. It&#039;s true, spreading misinformation is an important strategy of warfare, but only so much as it sows distrust among the basic community bonds. So ask yourself, who is spreading dissent? Who is trying to pit neighbor against neighbor? It&#039;s not Trump or, as you like to believe, the Russians. It&#039;s the left. They have you thinking everybody is a fascist or a Russian, which is a different kind of fascist now? They have you thinking you are surrounded on all sides by people who immediately threaten your life and livelihood, and that these agents could even be people you love. They have you disassociating with friends and family who disagree with you. It is easiest to judge actions by their fruit. When we look at the symptoms, which side shows the signs of psyops and propaganda? It&#039;s the left. You only trust &#039;official&#039; news. You believe anonymous sources about intent, when the law doesn&#039;t really care about intent. You rely on other &#039;official&#039; people to do your fact checking for you. You are perpetually under the strain of cognitive dissonance. You are angry about things you never cared about before. You&#039;ve never actually personally encountered any of these problems, or seen any first-hand reporting, but are convinced they are of monumental significance. You have never bothered to pay attention to any of these names or rules before, but now you do. And its people with a vested interest in the outcome coming to you with this information as though they cared about your safety. But if they cared, why did they not come to you before?

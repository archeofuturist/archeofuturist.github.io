It seems to me that history will judge him as someone who was better than the average murderous Russian autocrat, but who missed out on the opportunity to set Russia on a truly first-rate footing. He has repeatedly clutched at small, meaningless geopolitical gains rather than focusing on economic\/scientific\/cultural advancement, which would be the true prerequisites of setting the stage for a newly and enduringly successful Russia. He has lucked into a mass of fossil fuel wealth that can be traded for cash. But he is no geopolitical genius. Don&#039;t get me wrong, he&#039;s not dumb. But most likely he will be judged for missed opportunities. The Syrian intervention made sense in the cold calculus of realpolitik - Russia had to maintain a lever over the Middle East and credibility in the eyes of potential key allies. But Putin bungled the Ukraine situation. He got Crimea and the Donbass, but he pissed off something like 2\/3 of Ukrainians and gave the West an opportunity to openly reignite the Cold War containment strategy. And he had to limit himself to a series of small holding interventions against the Ukrainian military, in fear of fucking over the strategically vital energy sales to Western Europe. The fundamental issue \u2014 of Ukraine peeling away from the Russian block \u2014 remains. The correct strategy would have been to let it go without a fight, whether to the CIA or its own politicians. In this age of nuclear weapons, control of the Ukraine plays no important military purpose. Russian strength can only be based on dramatic improvements in the nation&#039;s economy.

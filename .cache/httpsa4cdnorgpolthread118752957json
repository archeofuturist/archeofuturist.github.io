It stinks like crazy and I save it inside a little bottle under my bed. I always drip some of my tampax fluids inside beverages or food that I prepare for my friends, but I always save the mucus. I think I have this mucus because of some weird vaginal infection or inflammation since I got from one of my many partners. When the mucus bottle is full I take it with me when I visit someone&#039;s place, then I ask to go to the bathroom and empty my rotten vaginal mucus inside their shampoo bottle. I do it because I really don&#039;t think people would like to wash their hair with women&#039;s diseased vaginal mucus, especially if they do it in the morning, they&#039;re going to be bummed for the rest of their day.<br>Then I wait for the period again and I resume saving up the mucus to do it again, I&#039;ve already done it around 10 times. It&#039;s a very fun prank to do and I&#039;ve done it at the gym as well.","time":1490766393,"resto":118752957,"id":"RH8h66Q\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118754212,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)01:55:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"not trumps plan","time":1490766921,"resto":118752957,"id":"R7Wt5\/A0","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118754439,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)01:58:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118752957\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118752957<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;tax cuts are a gift<\/span><br><br>Nope.

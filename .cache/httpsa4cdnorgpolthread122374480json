Living in California, I saw a change in demographics and removal of the white American stock who have build this amazing country. I wanted to stop illegals from destroying this country. I elected a man who made a promise to stop this from happening. I elected a man who wanted to secure the border with a wall. Instead, I got a Regan 2.0, repeating the biggest mistake that Regan made during his time as president:<br>Amnesty.<br>This is a 180 on what he promised. I gave him the benefit of the doubt when it came to the Syrian strike. As long as nation building was not involved. This is crossing the line. Anyone willing to defend Trump rather than hold him accountable for this betrayal is a Trump shill and needs to seriously reevaluate your life perspective.<br>The only positive is the overton window shift and how democracy&#039;s betrayal will only make people go farther right. Get training gents! This is the fall of Rome.<br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/UjgC8SBJf34<br>http:\/\/www.breitbart.com\/big-govern<wbr>ment\/2017\/04\/21\/trump-says-daca-ill<wbr>egals-can-rest-easy\/","filename":"1490859784372","ext":".jpg","w":621,"h":502,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":202,"tim":1492919029491,"time":1492919029,"md5":"QqJGs2LJg9+vbRDGemMLRQ==","fsize":48207,"resto":0,"id":"GZaPQlUD","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"i-used-to-be-a-trump-supporter-i-bought-his-hat","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

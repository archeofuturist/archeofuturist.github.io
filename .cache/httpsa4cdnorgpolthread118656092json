Moral relativism is itself Original Sin and it is the very thing that undermines and destroys society. It&#039;s no wonder that communism and other doctrines of that nature can so easily murder millions of people. By adopting moral relativism they weave the very fabric of Evil itself into their structure.","time":1490719660,"resto":118656092,"id":"IVmiE9jq","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118667554,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)12:48:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118667412\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118667412<\/a><br>OK so what is the test if something is moral or immoral<br>Also what does biology have to do with morality","time":1490719699,"resto":118656092,"id":"vs+LcxCG","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118667785,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)12:50:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118667554\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118667554<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;OK so what is the test if something is moral or immoral<\/span><br>watch your response to it","time":1490719841,"resto":118656092,"id":"Bl6nIyAu","country":"CZ","country_name":"Czech Republic"},{"no":118667863,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)12:51:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118667785\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118667785<\/a><br>Different people respond different ways","time":1490719891,"resto":118656092,"id":"vs+LcxCG","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118668144,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)12:54:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118667554\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118667554<\/a><br><a href=\"#p118667412\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118667412<\/a><br>Morality evolved WITH God which is why it is immutable.

Everyone shrugs off responsibility. The normies turn a blind eye, the politicians are corrupt, the young bourgeoisie avoid the Moslems with their money, and the nobility is weak, fractured, and emasculated.<br><br>\/pol\/, it is up to us to save the Europa and the West. While we have good principles, we are lacking a pragmatic mindset and a general plan.<br><br>I am therefore calling for a plan to promote nationalism, masculinity, white repopulation, and Moslem cleansing of Europa and the West. <br><br>We should also move beyond the mindset and into the real world, and perhaps but a plan together city by city, nation by nation (e.g. Expose the Belgian King (of inaction) and govt which approves Moslem-parasite-friendly policies, and brainstorm ways to round up and deport the invaders).<br><br>\/pol\/, it is up to us, and it&#039;s time to take action. Degeneracy has spread like a cancer throughout the world and we must fight back before it&#039;s too late.","filename":"IMG_0265","ext":".png","w":391,"h":220,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1492831132606,"time":1492831132,"md5":"Ht3gigOa7N7uTo0oepobzg==","fsize":165610,"resto":0,"id":"gRg5SS4N","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"failing-to-plan-is-planning-to-fail","country_name":"United States","replies":13,"images":1,"unique_ips":11},{"no":122229565,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)23:26:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"You forgot to use a proxy, Ramirez.","time":1492831592,"resto":122228819,"id":"yTcurnTg","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122229671,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)23:27:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"they will not act until the muzzies start destroying artworks.","time":1492831666,"resto":122228819,"id":"+mG7O32N","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122230458,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)23:35:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122229565\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122229565<\/a><br>I&#039;m back home for Easter.<br><br>What&#039;s the best platform for us to collaborate on a plan?","time":1492832151,"resto":122228819,"id":"gRg5SS4N","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122230836,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)23:39:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122228819\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122228819<\/a>","filename":"mms","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":583,"tn_w":107,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492832397906,"time":1492832397,"md5":"yw6LDcL\/tq\/3N0e5shen4Q==","fsize":69256,"resto":122228819,"id":"Jj30tuWP","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122231029,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)23:42:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122228819\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122228819<\/a><br>Lord Kek has foretold a victory for Le Pen.<br><br>The battle for Europe starts tomorrow.","time":1492832522,"resto":122228819,"id":"Sk\/JOWtS","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122231055,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)23:42:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122228819\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122228819<\/a><br>We must let Europe burn and the next Messiah will rise from the ashes.","time":1492832538,"resto":122228819,"id":"MD3KwTo3","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"},{"no":122232292,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)23:55:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122228819\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122228819<\/a><br>You won&#039;t be able to organize anything, this thread is going to be shilled by kike LARPs in no time with Strawman arguments, unpractical nonsense, irrational use of violence rather then rational and calculated and basically all the worst ideas possible that&#039;ll lead to the destruction of the country and most likely nuclear war.","time":1492833338,"resto":122228819,"id":"vtJPs0rI","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122232387,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)23:56:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"Nah","time":1492833402,"resto":122228819,"id":"dxkuUPDf","country":"KR","country_name":"South Korea"},{"no":122232826,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)00:01:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122230458\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122230458<\/a><br>can you fucks please stop larping? if you don&#039;t like how mainstream culture is move back to the US, get some cheap farmland somewhere and dick around on that<br><br>that&#039;s why our ancestors came here, you know?","time":1492833679,"resto":122228819,"id":"ASLB+lVz","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122233414,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)00:07:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122228819\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122228819<\/a><br>Based Sitck Man is more than just a meme.

The easiest and most practical would be massive propaganda on their social media and connect\/affiliate it with popular youtubers or thinking people in those nations. Right now I view their situation as being a loss cause, that&#039;s why le pen is very important because her and the supporters can set an example. Relating to propaganda, id bet there are a lot of women who harbor deep hatred for the situation and hiding it to not seem racist. That&#039;s one thing that le pen has garnished with younger voters. Anyway have a bump for more knowledgeable anons, because I think Europe is like a stubborn child that will only change when the situation becomes liife threatening.","time":1492834207,"resto":122228819,"id":"YL30lM5I","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122234208,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)00:14:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122233725\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122233725<\/a><br>I always thought that for France, you pick a no-go Muslim zone and you cut off supply lines.

Under Alfonso VIII of Castile. (1166\u20131214) there were many warriors among the wealthy and cultured Jews of Toledo that fought bravely against the Moors. Alfonso X., called &quot;the Wise&quot;, while infante, had many Jews in his army; and in the capture of Seville (1298) the Jewish warriors distinguished themselves so highly that, in compensation for their services, Alfonso allotted to them certain lands for the formation of a Jewish village. He also transferred to them three mosques which they turned into synagogues. The cruel fanaticism of the Moors had alienated the Jews, who were now won over to the Christians by the tolerant rule of the latter. Jews fought bravely at the side of Pedro the Cruel in defense of the cities of Toledo, Briviesca, and Burgos, against Henry de Trastamara, his brother, and had to pay for their loyalty to their king either with their lives and the lives of their undefended wives and children, or, as the Jews of Burgos had to do, with a heavy ransom to the relentless victor.<\/span>","time":1493879973,"resto":124030577,"id":"Kqds7ibl","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":124030925,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)02:39:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"im convinced that 90% of the jew hatred on this board is from faggot white bois that got their dick snipped.","time":1493879997,"resto":124030577,"id":"v0jtgNiE","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124030991,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)02:40:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124030887\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124030887<\/a><br>and even more<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Nili (Hebrew language, an acronym of a phrase in I Samuel 15:29; transliteration: Netzakh Yisrael Lo Yishaker, literal translation: &quot;The Eternity of Israel does not lie&quot;) was a Jewish espionage network which assisted the United Kingdom in its fight against the Ottoman Empire, then occupying the Land of Israel during World War I.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;During the First World War, 100,000 Jews served in the German forces. 12,000 were killed in action.

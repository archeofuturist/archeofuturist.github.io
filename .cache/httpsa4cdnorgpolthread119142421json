The Lonicera fly is an example of a novel animal species that resulted from natural hybridization. The American red wolf appears to be a hybrid species between gray wolf and coyote,[29] although its taxonomic status has been a subject of controversy.[30][31][32] The European edible frog is a semi-permanent hybrid between pool frogs and marsh frogs. The edible frog population requires the continued presence of at least one of the parent species.[33] Cave paintings indicate that the European bison is a natural hybrid of the aurochs and the steppe bison.[34][35]<br><br>Hybrid species of plants are much more common than animals. Many crop species are hybrids, including notably the polyploid wheats: some have four sets of chromosomes (tetraploid) or six (hexaploid), while other wheat species have (like most eukaryotic organisms) two sets (diploid), so hybridization events likely involved the doubling of chromosome sets, causing immediate genetic isolation.[36]<br><br>Hybridization may be important in speciation in some plant groups. However, homoploid hybrid speciation (not increasing the number of sets of chromosomes) may be rare: by 1997, only 8 natural examples had been fully described. Experimental studies suggest that hybridization offers a rapid route to speciation, a prediction confirmed by the fact that early generation hybrids and ancient hybrid species have matching genomes, meaning that once hybridization has occurred, the new genome can remain stable.[37]<br><br>Many hybrid zones are known where the ranges of two species meet, and hybrids are continually produced in great numbers. These hybrid zones are useful as biological model systems for studying the mechanisms of speciation. Recently DNA analysis of a bear shot by a hunter in the North West Territories confirmed the existence of naturally-occurring and fertile grizzly\u2013polar bear hybrids.[38]<br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hybri<wbr>d_(biology)","time":1491125417,"resto":119142421,"id":"fCsP3hzM","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119185037,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)05:58:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119151000\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119151000<\/a><br>I picked a hell of a day to stop sniffing glue!","filename":"no_feed_awoos","ext":".jpg","w":375,"h":500,"tn_w":93,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491127085723,"time":1491127085,"md5":"5NTsTSP9axFIe7EF\/BcKrA==","fsize":154889,"resto":119142421,"id":"INOc34uR","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119185577,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)06:08:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119142421\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119142421<\/a><br>Development of Cultures are unable to grow naturally because of higher Powers which lead to An unnatural society which feels off","time":1491127681,"resto":119142421,"id":"AABqCOtm","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"}]}

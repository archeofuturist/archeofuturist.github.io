I don&#039;t feel true compassion, my whole family is abusive, and i am too, yet i dream about this goal of becoming a real good person at heart.<br>So i know something&#039;s wrong, it&#039;s just that i don&#039;t want to leave it all and live on my own for years. It&#039;s dangerous of course, but is this the right way?","filename":"1472250994086","ext":".jpg","w":2310,"h":1781,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":192,"tim":1491217659233,"time":1491217659,"md5":"UEoeY8xF0WCuf92ynbAXOQ==","fsize":1552067,"resto":0,"id":"JBOpMqDj","country":"AT","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"leaving-society","country_name":"Austria","replies":17,"images":1,"unique_ips":13},{"no":119316544,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)07:08:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119316486\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119316486<\/a><br>Sure, yeah","time":1491217718,"resto":119316486,"id":"scq\/OOu5","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119316563,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)07:08:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119316486\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119316486<\/a><br>wow, great job","time":1491217733,"resto":119316486,"id":"JnO0q6dN","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119316696,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)07:11:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119316544\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119316544<\/a><br><a href=\"#p119316563\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119316563<\/a><br>first word, second word","time":1491217889,"resto":119316486,"id":"WCTpNmIO","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119317055,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)07:16:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119316486\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119316486<\/a><br>You will die <br>Nature is not harmonious, you will get eaten alive by mosquitos, eat twigs and leaves until you shit yourself to near death at which point a grizzly bear will come and finish you off<br>Nature is only harmonious when you are with a group of like minded people who want live sustainably off the land.

We seek to make ourselves &quot;more&quot; by claiming possession over things that lie outside of ourselves. It&#039;s a pursuit that never ends and never fulfills us. We may think it does for brief periods, but eventually dissatisfaction sets in again and it&#039;s back to the hamster wheel. The only way to be truly happy is to be at peace with yourself, and the way to do that is to realize that you&#039;re in the hamster wheel of ceaseless pursuit, of craving and wanting. Almost nobody is happy, and it&#039;s time to realize that you won&#039;t ever be happy either by doing the same things as everyone else.","time":1491218359,"resto":119316486,"id":"2QV5FYRL","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":119317233,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)07:19:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119316486\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119316486<\/a><br><br>if you have a feminine penis you can come live with me innawoods alaska.","time":1491218392,"resto":119316486,"id":"NrKPBBpC","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119317285,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)07:20:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119317055\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119317055<\/a><br>this can happen, but buddha did it too. for 10 years!<br>you know, i&#039;m content with fearing nature, rather than fearing humans, which is a horrible feeling.","time":1491218441,"resto":119316486,"id":"JBOpMqDj","country":"AT","country_name":"Austria"},{"no":119317388,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)07:22:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119317205\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119317205<\/a><br>oh, believe me, i tried.<br>nobody gave me help, not even that, but all of the people i met were simply making me unhappy again.

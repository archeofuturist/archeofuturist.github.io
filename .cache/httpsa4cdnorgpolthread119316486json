In its most common usage, the word &#039;siddhi&#039; refers to an ability that is a natural and inherent faculty of our true identities as eternally alive souls. The soul is smaller than an atom and larger than the universe. The soul is infinitely small and infinitely large. The soul is ALL-PERFECT AND EVER-PERFECT.

Among all of these siddhis, there are considered to be eight major siddhis. Siddhis can be awakened through a variety of methods.

This was the first election in 50-100 years that actually seemed to represent us and not the Jews. Our hopes and dreams were all set up with the wall, the entry bans, the ICE raids, and other good things. We even get great spicings and proof that Israel false flagged mass-antisemitism. Then we got the Ryancare debacle. It seemed like 4D chess. The msm and Russian narrative were being btfo and the old corrupt politicians seemed like they were on their last ropes. Things seemed good for Americans online as well. We were uncucked and had a bright future.<br>Then in one single day, pretty much all of this was ripped to fucking threads in a betrayal by the one man that most of us thought would never betray us. In one day all of what we worked for, suffered for, voted for, and held dear was butchered in front of us by Donald Trump. He made it clear that America First was a fucking lie and that Israel First and the rest of the Neocon agenda is all that matters. The last remaining ray of hope is that Bannon is still on the team, and that is looking like more and more worrisome by the day. On top of all of that, we&#039;ve gone all the way back to being public enemy number one on the Internet with anyone remotely worth talking to.<br>In short, for anyone in other countries that have buyers remorse over Trump, just imagine how we feel.","time":1491597518,"resto":120015590,"id":"SMaeLrXq","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120019479,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)16:39:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120015590\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120015590<\/a><br><br>More shilling from \/leftypol\/","filename":"1482225805677","ext":".jpg","w":513,"h":432,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":105,"tim":1491597577579,"time":1491597577,"md5":"GyXh2TDNfFpxa9mtyXDVIw==","fsize":42022,"resto":120015590,"id":"vlg1b0js","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

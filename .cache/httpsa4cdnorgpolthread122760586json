Terrain and geopolitics. People don&#039;t want to admit that just because a country is one big jungle can make the difference between a war being winnable or not but it can. Especially when they can just infiltrate by using soyrroubding countries<br><br>2. There was never a good strategy. Body counts? That&#039;s a war of attrition and while the US easily has the manufacturing capability to win such a war, they never have the stomach for it. They&#039;ll lose support long before it&#039;s over.<br><br>3. Media. The US failed to harness it. So the Tet Offensive, which should have been seen as the catastrophic defeat for the North that it was, was see as a major defeat for the US. Didn&#039;t help that they told everyone the war was almost over.<br><br>4. This is really the fundamental problem: the South Vietnamese were not willing to die for American democracy. You can&#039;t actually liberate a people if they aren&#039;t willing to liberate themselves. Che learned this the hard way in Africa. You can arm them. You can train them. You can fight their battles for them. But unless they are willing to sacrifice everything for it, it will never be sustainable. <br><br>The South Vietnamese feared the communists more than wanted American style democracy. They weren&#039;t willing to endure their families getting executed by VC. And without the will of the people, they couldn&#039;t really win.<br><br>It&#039;s like Eight-ball said in FMJ: &quot;They took away our freedom and gave it to the gookers. They don&#039;t want it.

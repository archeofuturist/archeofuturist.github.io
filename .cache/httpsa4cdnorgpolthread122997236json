We need to make the left great again once we reset the damage that has been done. <br><br>Currently things seem to be going towards the trend of a one world government. The people who support this will also be in control of the media and many corporations so their will be very few people who can fight against it. Ultimately they might think what they are doing is for the best and they might think they have our best interests in mind, but according to me and most people, they don&#039;t. <br><br>Unfortunately they will control everything so it will be extremely difficult to rebel after this becomes a reality. <br><br>Something else will pop up if we defeat it for sure, but it will be the job of future generations to stop the new thing. <br><br>If instead of globalism we have many strong nations that are sovereign and independent, it is at least possible to escape if one of them becomes a dystopia, but if the whole world is one government, there is no escape. That is why I think nationalism world wide and not just saving the white countries is important. We need united blocks of people capable of resisting each other for people all over the world to be free.","filename":"savewest","ext":".jpg","w":568,"h":616,"tn_w":230,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493268949303,"time":1493268949,"md5":"vQ1A\/B+fqqWOULD80fPvDA==","fsize":45577,"resto":0,"id":"4K+bSqnY","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"leftfugee-general-people-who-left-the-left","country_name":"Canada","replies":2,"images":1,"unique_ips":2},{"no":122997981,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)01:04:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"I think most white nationalists are also broadly ethnic nationalists for other peoples- it&#039;s just that we don&#039;t live in those nations and they&#039;re not of importance to us when our nations are so far up their own asses with pretending race isn&#039;t real. <br>Sargon of Akkad was my link between nihilism and \/pol\/, personally, although it&#039;s debatable how &quot;left&quot; he is.","filename":"Eyuwws08H9ebx97nSEzhdUKM_500","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":332,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1493269440224,"time":1493269440,"md5":"kANbleEIceG1PzX9J9dWSg==","fsize":32167,"resto":122997236,"id":"Vvd1O8S1","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122999395,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)01:19:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122997981\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122997981<\/a><br>race is real but its not a reason to not treat people as individuals.<br><br>I&#039;m ethnonationalist pretty much from a utilitarian perspective.

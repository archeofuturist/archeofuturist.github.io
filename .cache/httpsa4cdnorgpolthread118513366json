A communist system would thus free individuals from alienation in the sense of having one&#039;s life structured around survival (making a wage or salary in a capitalist system), which Marx referred to as a transition from the &quot;realm of necessity&quot; to the &quot;realm of freedom.&quot; As a result, a communist society is envisioned as being composed of an intellectually-inclined population with both the time and resources to pursue its creative hobbies and genuine interests, and to contribute to creative social wealth in this manner. Karl Marx considered &quot;true richness&quot; to be the amount of time one has at his or her disposal to pursue one&#039;s creative passions. Marx&#039;s notion of communism is in this way radically individualistic.","filename":"7f9777c7aa921c0d165505ffaed788b9df7f798715b9d66637af0f3cc2bd1928","ext":".jpg","w":700,"h":933,"tn_w":93,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490623107724,"time":1490623107,"md5":"cAPHLuA35v6eT85c3T8vaw==","fsize":292634,"resto":118513366,"id":"R\/S+IRrN","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":118516162,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)10:14:32","name":"Anonymous","filename":"1490497291283","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":500,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490624072253,"time":1490624072,"md5":"XzLAj3Qslr1YIbcM8Agu\/g==","fsize":133934,"resto":118513366,"id":"R\/S+IRrN","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":118517615,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)10:31:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118513366\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118513366<\/a><br>Marx was right!","time":1490625111,"resto":118513366,"id":"MvWKXpgk","country":"BG","country_name":"Bulgaria"},{"no":118517810,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)10:34:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=oJ1<wbr>eZqenaDw<br><br>NAZI&#039;S BTFO","filename":"boston antifa","ext":".jpg","w":4032,"h":3024,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1490625240587,"time":1490625240,"md5":"vGQdXEDKOIzbDu0SyYrsFw==","fsize":2752078,"resto":118513366,"id":"6F4G+79\/","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":118517910,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)10:35:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118514852\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118514852<\/a><br>Sauce on the animu gril please","time":1490625311,"resto":118513366,"id":"X0+fg1ap","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118518016,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)10:36:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118513366\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118513366<\/a>","filename":"hoppe","ext":".png","w":1000,"h":1000,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490625390990,"time":1490625390,"md5":"a7z6R4FgMqtla7VghEM79A==","fsize":198820,"resto":118513366,"id":"x6zheMfx","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":118518065,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)10:36:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118513366\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118513366<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Spaniard<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Commie<\/span><br>Why am I not surprised.<br><br>VIVA FRANCO!","filename":"keep-calm-and-viva-franco-8","ext":".png","w":600,"h":700,"tn_w":107,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490625419208,"time":1490625419,"md5":"FRabqEYNfOXmkOyyWu90Cg==","fsize":273187,"resto":118513366,"id":"teDhx+G9","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118518130,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)10:37:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"COMMUNISM KILLS<br>NEVER FORGET<br><br>Keep to \/lefty\/pol you cunt. <br>Sage goes in all fields.","filename":"0621e94236c73b790928950edfef3234557245fd278244ab160a435ab5b517dc","ext":".png","w":800,"h":800,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490625464017,"time":1490625464,"md5":"dpKaQUw3+h9ju4FhGVvEJA==","fsize":508765,"resto":118513366,"id":"teDhx+G9","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118518398,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)10:40:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118513366\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118513366<\/a><br>What contemporary public figures, be they politicians, professors, or journalists, do you communists admire and follow?

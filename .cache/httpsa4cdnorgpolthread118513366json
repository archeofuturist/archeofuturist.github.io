This general is for the discussion of Marxism-Leninism, the ideology of revolutionary socialism and communism.<br><br>Communism is the next stage of humanity following the capitalist stage.<br><br>What exactly is communism according to Marxist-Leninists:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Communism is a stage of society in which the productive infrastructure is socially owned, and goods are produced not in order to sell for profit, but in order to meet a social need.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Communism in it&#039;s full form is a stateless, classless society that follows the maxim &quot;From each according to their ability, to each according to their need.&quot;<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;To achieve such a society Marxism-Leninism teaches us that we must replace the capitalist state, which is controlled by the capitalist class, by a socialist state, which is controlled by the working class. Then, a period of class struggle follows in which the capitalist class is liquidated by the working class. When the capitalist class has been completely vanquished, there will be only one class, the working class, and eventually the functions of the state will become indistinguishable from the functions of the society as a whole, and the state as such will &#039;wither away&#039; as Marx said.<\/span><br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/ma<wbr>rx\/works\/1847\/11\/prin-com.htm<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/ma<wbr>rx\/works\/1848\/communist-manifesto\/<br><br>ML uses a philosophy called dialectical materialism, see here:<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/reference\/<wbr>archive\/stalin\/works\/1938\/09.htm<br><br>It is recommended that you read some of the critical works of Marxism-Leninism so you can make an informed assessment of the ideology.<br><br>Resources:<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/ma<wbr>rx\/works\/sw\/<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/le<wbr>nin\/works\/sw\/<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/reference\/<wbr>archive\/stalin\/works\/decades-index.<wbr>htm<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/reference\/<wbr>archive\/mao\/selected-works\/<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/ma<wbr>rx\/works\/1884\/origin-family\/<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/le<wbr>nin\/works\/1914\/mar\/11.htm","filename":"1481244074852","ext":".png","w":1010,"h":1010,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490622052356,"time":1490622052,"md5":"676S1nirnOI5InkeibSxFw==","fsize":177742,"resto":0,"id":"R\/S+IRrN","country":"ES","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"communism-general","country_name":"Spain","replies":4,"images":3,"unique_ips":2},{"no":118513652,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)09:44:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118513366\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118513366<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;spamming retarded commie pasta on \/pol\/ has never been tried.<\/span>","time":1490622246,"resto":118513366,"id":"lL+FQVeU","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":118514133,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)09:49:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"A communist economic system would be characterized by advanced productive technology that enables material abundance, which in turn would enable the free distribution of most or all economic output and the holding of the means of producing this output in common. In this respect communism is differentiated from socialism, which, out of economic necessity, restricts access to articles of consumption and services based on one&#039;s contribution.","filename":"info","ext":".jpg","w":2048,"h":1152,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1490622590439,"time":1490622590,"md5":"cqMP\/ahCrmZJG7XNSY8hQA==","fsize":576670,"resto":118513366,"id":"R\/S+IRrN","country":"ES","m_img":1,"country_name":"Spain"},{"no":118514852,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)09:58:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"A communist society would free individuals from long working hours by first automating production to an extent that the average length of the working day is reduced and second by eliminating the exploitation inherent in the division between workers and owners. A communist system would thus free individuals from alienation in the sense of having one&#039;s life structured around survival (making a wage or salary in a capitalist system), which Marx referred to as a transition from the &quot;realm of necessity&quot; to the &quot;realm of freedom.&quot; As a result, a communist society is envisioned as being composed of an intellectually-inclined population with both the time and resources to pursue its creative hobbies and genuine interests, and to contribute to creative social wealth in this manner. Karl Marx considered &quot;true richness&quot; to be the amount of time one has at his or her disposal to pursue one&#039;s creative passions. Marx&#039;s notion of communism is in this way radically individualistic.","filename":"7f9777c7aa921c0d165505ffaed788b9df7f798715b9d66637af0f3cc2bd1928","ext":".jpg","w":700,"h":933,"tn_w":93,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490623107724,"time":1490623107,"md5":"cAPHLuA35v6eT85c3T8vaw==","fsize":292634,"resto":118513366,"id":"R\/S+IRrN","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":118516162,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)10:14:32","name":"Anonymous","filename":"1490497291283","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":500,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490624072253,"time":1490624072,"md5":"XzLAj3Qslr1YIbcM8Agu\/g==","fsize":133934,"resto":118513366,"id":"R\/S+IRrN","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"}]}

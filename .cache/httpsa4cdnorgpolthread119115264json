But few do the step of caring as much that you will see or hear about it. And it&#039;s what I meant about apathy or extremism. Nobody brings up the state of African rhinos to have a good time, they do because they care so much they can&#039;t shut up about it. You can&#039;t really expect the majority of people to follow one thing or another in this day and age unless it&#039;s for the self, ego boost, entertainment or a dream. We eat it up, get lost in it, struggle for it. Then we get sick of it and need more, you can apply that to everything. We aren&#039;t a smart species, as a species we are working towards nothing. Individuals do, and they do get people to join or help, but it is never the majority and so you will always lack something from the majority if you want something from them unless you can play them. <br><br>And the jews thing is bigger than you think, it&#039;s a whole different reality that is being hidden from us. It is our history being willingly and systematically destroyed. It&#039;s not just about financial power, that&#039;s one part of it. The main part is being able to pull of things on such a scale that it has worldwide effects over long periods of time. And it&#039;s gonna culminate in something horrible if they aren&#039;t stopped, and nobody is doing that. It&#039;s a double whammy I tell ya, both the jew and nature is gonna fuck us over hard in the next 5 years and for all foreseeable future until a new cataclysm.","time":1491006784,"resto":119115264,"id":"WYE6xuJV","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":119121575,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)20:36:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"Look at the content on the History channel for fuck sake.<br><br>Even 24\/7 WW2 Hitlerathons were better than the absolutely pathetic shit that&#039;s on nowadays.","time":1491006980,"resto":119115264,"id":"DJpK1YMB","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119121680,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)20:37:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119115264\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119115264<\/a><br>Everyone is too busy looking at their phone and trying to win on social media","time":1491007044,"resto":119115264,"id":"6niqjuW6","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119123443,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)20:54:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119115264\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119115264<\/a><br>We cared about nature when the European race dominated the planet.

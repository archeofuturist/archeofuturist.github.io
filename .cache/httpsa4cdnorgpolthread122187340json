They want open conflict and it&#039;s true that aggression from one side will increase aggression from the other. Of course if we don&#039;t give comfortable Islamists what they want they will start to become more violent. The quickest way to peace is appeasement, as some Burger once said. But that is a cost too high for us so the only reasonable road is war, hopefully figuratively and not literally. And ISIS sure as hell don&#039;t want peace.","time":1492810280,"resto":122187340,"id":"bCn2ovqF","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":122188647,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)17:32:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122188291\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122188291<\/a><br>Thanks for the input then.

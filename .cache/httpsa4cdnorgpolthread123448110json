You may have heard that Liberia and Ethiopia were never colonized, those claims are demonstrably false. <br><br>Liberia was a dumping ground for American slaves, and was run by white men from the United States. Today in the US children are taught that Liberia was an independent nation. Pure coincidence it was run by whites and its architecture mirrored the pre Civil War American South. <br><br>Ethiopia got deep dicked by fucking Italy and Mussolini, the country that couldn&#039;t hold a candle to any other European combatant in WWII. The Italians could have bombed the &#039;member of the Holy Trinity&#039; cult leader Haile Selassie as he abandoned his nation in a train with all the gold he could fit, but opted not to.<br><br>It&#039;s absolutely laughable that Africans laud their &#039;unconquered&#039; nations that were filled with<br>1.) Imported slaves and plantation style government buildings <br>And <br>2.) A bunch of spear chucking cultists that couldn&#039;t beat the weakest &#039;power&#039; of WWII fighting on their home turf, even with support from Germany.<br><br>General Africa laughter thread as well.","filename":"CF19F280-2630-45CC-B4CE-09E1331D8CAC-346-0000004FC8362FCC","ext":".jpg","w":251,"h":201,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":200,"tim":1493534761846,"time":1493534761,"md5":"7qqZzIhjrU1Arx4rBOZgrg==","fsize":11985,"resto":0,"id":"DEbuN5Ip","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-myth-of-uncolonized-africa","country_name":"United States","replies":4,"images":4,"unique_ips":1},{"no":123448512,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)02:51:02","name":"Anonymous","filename":"917EE998-C5A7-4DD5-B47F-5CC884E156D2-346-00000054A575A155","ext":".jpg","w":1000,"h":974,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":121,"tim":1493535062045,"time":1493535062,"md5":"fAK9DYPYKLC32gca0Lcscg==","fsize":446235,"resto":123448110,"id":"DEbuN5Ip","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123449170,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)02:59:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"False map that triggered me to make this thread","filename":"52710ED6-3F26-47CE-8472-FBF11B0F8B93-346-0000004B12FF7372","ext":".jpg","w":900,"h":900,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493535556084,"time":1493535556,"md5":"updbEV37+VyU6cBb4pV5zg==","fsize":108702,"resto":123448110,"id":"DEbuN5Ip","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123449294,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)03:00:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"And we should have sent every single nigger to Liberia when we had the chance.","filename":"74213730-1163-4F64-989A-13B479D5C555-7939-00000B83E75A7211","ext":".jpg","w":547,"h":578,"tn_w":118,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493535635004,"time":1493535635,"md5":"wLzXVEPW2L9vK\/JyfP3rZw==","fsize":86007,"resto":123448110,"id":"DEbuN5Ip","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123449690,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)03:05:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"But (((who))) is behind the idea that I was taught in<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;American education <\/span><br>That Ethiopia was stronk independent nation forever and Liberia wuz never colonized?","filename":"IMG_0312","ext":".gif","w":609,"h":343,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1493535935689,"time":1493535935,"md5":"Bvkkxv3qQWMp7RgGTXtbgA==","fsize":38593,"resto":123448110,"id":"DEbuN5Ip","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

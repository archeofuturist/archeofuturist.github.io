They needed money for other things but the electoral college gave rural and suburban retards too much power and all their money kept going towards buying them big toys so that they could blow stuff up.<br><br>The malaise persisted for decades, after the US Army kept getting BTFO time and again, wherever they went, they just kept fucking up and liberals were getting tired of paying.<br><br>Things got really bad during 9\/11. The attacks were bad enough, but the fact that it happened in Manhattan really shook things up. People started asking questions. Why did the air force just sit there with their dicks in their hands? What do those people do all day with taxpayers&#039; money? Wasn&#039;t the army preventing these groups from operating? Liberals were starting to lose patience and people were starting to hate rural and suburban retards, so naturally they decided to prove everyone wrong by invading 2 countries at once and show the world that Murrika was still number one.<br><br>Obviously they got completely fucked up and things are now worse than they&#039;ve ever been, so liberals decided to take matters into their own hands and invested heavily into the NSA and Democrats worked hard on implementing policies aimed at preventing rural and suburban retards from chimping out and dragging the country into another war again. <br><br>But of course this has made rural and suburban retards very angry because military culture is still very strong in those areas, and so they elected the most pro-military candidate that I can remember and he&#039;s now raised the military budget dramatically whilst cutting the science budget as well as everything else that liberals care about.<br><br>Whenever people claim that liberals aren&#039;t open minded I just roll my eyes.

Afghanistan produces opium. And fast forward: America has a serious heroin problem spurred on by pharmaceutical companies getting a glut of opium because American forces negotiated with tribes to sell opium in Tajikistan to third parties buyers who were overinundated with poppy and sold it at pennies on the dollar to American exporters. American exporters then sell to pharmaceutical companies (still at a discount because volume is a fucking bitch) and whatever dust is left on the refinery floor they scrape up and sell to gangs. Gangs then export to street gangs who then sell it in the streets at next-to-nothing. Crack is even getting BTFO. Nigs nog. White affluencias get hooked. White chicks get blacked for their fix. <br><br>MCs transport across the country. Police look the other way because they call it a &quot;self-correcting&quot; addiction (it is. Eventually. A lot of bad shit happens before then, though). <br><br>State politicians get elected on the platform of everything BUT the opiod addiction crisis because the only two solutions are: lock up the degenerates and spend more money on corrections housing them all (and recidivism associated with that addiction) OR spend LOADS of money paying addiction centers to treat addicts where they use unproven theories to achieve a record 18-20% &quot;cure&quot; rate for treatment.","filename":"bad-decisions-man-saves-the-day","ext":".jpg","w":1200,"h":645,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":67,"tim":1490214609206,"time":1490214609,"md5":"k4MxazLzY28atxTFLTSGnQ==","fsize":58847,"resto":117817634,"id":"PPgbgRLf","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":117820433,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)16:30:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117817889\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117817889<\/a><br>fpbp, you hit it on the nail. we can fight all fucking day in shitskinistan but until we take the land it will still have some sort of radical force trying to conquer the land.","time":1490214659,"resto":117817634,"id":"j8kMbBZw","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

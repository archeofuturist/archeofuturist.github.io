Chris Christie (R), a close ally of President Trump, is calling on the Transportation Department to \u201cimmediately suspend the federal regulation&quot; allowing airlines to overbook flights amid outrage over United Airlines\u2019 physical removal of a passenger from a packed plane.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The letter said Christie is reviewing how New Jersey can curb this \u201cabusive practice,\u201d but it also calls on the White House to end the regulation, claiming that the federal government can deal with it \u201cmost immediately.\u201d <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u201cI know the Trump administration wants to reform regulations to help the American people.

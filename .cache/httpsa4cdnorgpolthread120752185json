Four of his five kids are doctors.<br><br>Dao had his medical license suspended for more than 10 years for illegally prescribing painkillers to patients. Dao was working as a pulmonologist in Elizabethtown when he was arrested in 2003. The same year, Dao was charged with 98 counts of illegally prescribing and trafficking prescription painkillers such as hydrocodone, Oxycontin and Percocet. Surveillance video captured Dao meeting patients and supplying them with painkillers, mostly hydrocodone. In one deal, Dao received $174 in exchange for pills.<br><br>Dr. Dao, who was seen in the viral video of him being forcibly dragged off the United Airlines flight to Louisville on Sunday, allegedly became sexually interested in a male patient whom he later made his office manager.

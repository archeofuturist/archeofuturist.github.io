This is a nice little rundown that makes perfect sense. Yahweh is very interesting. You can stack the Hebrew letters of his name and form the image of man. \u03c07\u03c0\u20227 is also an interesting calculation. The whole cross of mathematics and religion just fascinates me and I&#039;m not sure yet what it all means.","time":1492607211,"resto":121841037,"id":"MTbd4k8O","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121842906,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)09:18:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121841037\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121841037<\/a><br>Exodus 6 appears to be the first mention of Yahweh. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;And I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, by the name of God Almighty, but by my name JEHOVAH was I not known to them.<\/span><br><br>Based off the old testament (edited), are we to assume this God is not the same as the first and was in fact lying to Moses?<br><br>Ive wondered about this. His character seems especially different around the time of Moses. The first god, with Abraham, would walk side by side with the humans. But Jehovah shows up flying around on a cloud. Or hiding on a mountain top, threatening death to anyone who sees him, or makes appearances in a display of fire that does not burn. <br><br>The God of Abraham was fair. He talked with Abraham about moral issues and was open to discussion. While Moses&#039;s God was demanding, with rules, and he supported slavery even though he just helped the Hebrews get out of it!

I have yet to solidify mine but I&#039;m open to discovering all the possibilities. following the qabballah, there is mind and there is matter and then there is the thing between, which is soul. Everything is polarized in this way. God could very well be the substance of what is mind, and all explanations of him can only be limited to metaphor. But this in no way makes God less real. By acknowledging the greater world outside the material, it is a funny thought to realize that the more real thing is outside of this world altogether. Then again, God could just be a creature from space. And that&#039;s a whole different route, but just as exciting.","time":1492609213,"resto":121841037,"id":"MTbd4k8O","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

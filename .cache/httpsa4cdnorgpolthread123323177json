Yes, lowered population will tend to result in lower GDP, just as higher population will lead to higher GDP. The mistake is using GDP as a measure of the public good, when you should be using Per Capita GDP - that is, the total GDP divided by the total population. This essentially gives you a rough average of how wealthy each individual citizen is. It isn&#039;t a perfect measure of a society&#039;s happiness, but it&#039;s much more accurate than raw GDP.<br><br>As long as the population is decreasing faster than the GDP, the per capita GDP is actually increasing. This is consistent with what&#039;s happening in Japan, where standard of living has continued to increase even as GDP has stagnated. Because population growth is ultimately limited on a finite planet, all nations will eventually face this transition from growth economies to steady-state economies where real GDP and population remain roughly constant.

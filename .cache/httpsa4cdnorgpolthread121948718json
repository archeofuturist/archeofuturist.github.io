So a part of me says that I must have a distrust of government because the people who are drawn to it these days are not the kind of people I would trust in normal day-to-day life. Similarly, in general I don&#039;t like police officers because the people that the force attracts are generally power hungry, not-quite-bright people who see an easy route to authority and a pension. That&#039;s how I see cops because so many power-hungry douchebags manage to get on the force.","time":1492664048,"resto":121948718,"id":"0ryyzjYw","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121954552,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)00:54:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121954371\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121954371<\/a><br>yeah. they are nice.","time":1492664084,"resto":121948718,"id":"aPz2+3iX","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121954654,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)00:55:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121954479\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121954479<\/a><br>yes, that is exactly how i feel. and i am asking you: how do you escape it? what do you do?","time":1492664149,"resto":121948718,"id":"aPz2+3iX","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121955008,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)00:59:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"This thread is a gift from the heavens, I actually felt like I was going to loose my sanity with everything that happened today.","filename":"IMG_1703","ext":".png","w":640,"h":360,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1492664347993,"time":1492664347,"md5":"66piFIBU88VZdsa5xdDBoA==","fsize":256993,"resto":121948718,"id":"DVjGmrp9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121955307,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)01:02:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"Surfing you kook","time":1492664540,"resto":121948718,"id":"dOTGKJAi","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121955473,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)01:04:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121955008\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121955008<\/a><br>hey, i am glad it helped.","time":1492664640,"resto":121948718,"id":"aPz2+3iX","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121955682,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)01:06:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121948718\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121948718<\/a><br><br>CEramics, i would suggest this to any fag on here. its very therapeutic and just fells amazing to make something with your hands","time":1492664766,"resto":121948718,"id":"C9KxZb2N","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121955765,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)01:07:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121948718\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121948718<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;politically active irl<\/span><br>no thanks","time":1492664826,"resto":121948718,"id":"wyFgdz7a","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121955858,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)01:08:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"vaporwave<br><br>listening to this now:<br>http:\/\/poolhouseltdmusic.com\/album\/<wbr>virtual-skies-ii","filename":"nigel-vaporwave","ext":".jpg","w":1544,"h":1080,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":87,"tim":1492664885594,"time":1492664885,"md5":"S2PG279yHwhqTVq\/8tWyfA==","fsize":430042,"resto":121948718,"id":"yhJydP1O","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":121955859,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)01:08:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121954654\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121954654<\/a><br><br>Well, I work a normie job but for three weeks every year I go backpacking\/hitchhiking\/freighthopp<wbr>ing and get to disappear for a while.

Most of us have things pretty good. And while the system is self-evidently supremely fucked, we all, to a certain degree, get to play by our own rules. Your life belongs to you. Most people choose to play within the rules and live safe, &quot;healthy&quot; lives. A few others of us decide to throw caution to the wind and search for adventures, wherever we may find them. And if those adventures end up killing us, so what? We were on a quick path towards death anyway. <br><br>Although it was a trite, overdone movie, think about that scene in Scarface when Al Pacino has just finished killing Robert Loggia.

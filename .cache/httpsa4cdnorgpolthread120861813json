The problem is that one group of kooks overlooks Saudi influence, another group overlooks the Mossad agents and the last group overlooks American intelligence agencies. In reality, these three countries have been incredibly close allies since the 70s and are all heavily connected to the events leading up to and following 9\/11. Hell, instead of just giving the Saudis foreign aid, the CIA just sets up banks to launder dirty money for them.","time":1492056003,"resto":120861813,"id":"JVO4XP1l","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

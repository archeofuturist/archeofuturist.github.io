They identify as their sex and do not see their gender separate from their sex. <br>.3% of people experience gender and sex separately. This rare set of people suffer from a mental health syndrome clinically defined as Gender Dysphoria.<br><br>Gender Dysphoria (known popularly as transgenderism) is a rare egosyntonic mental health syndrome that is characterized by the following symptoms: experiencing sex and gender separately, depression, anxiety, distress, acute discomfort, suicidal thoughts, and body dysmorphia.<br><br>Current treatment for Gender dysphoria is psychiatric counseling as the foundation, coupled with reinforcing therapies known as &#039;transitioning&#039; which allow the sufferer to take on the appearance of the opposite sex in order to relieve their symptoms. <br>Gender Dysphoria patients must be clinically diagnosed by a psychiatrist before &#039;transitioning&#039; treatments can be prescribed. Psychiatric counseling takes place concurrently to &#039;transitioning&#039; and is ongoing through and after transitioning. &#039;Transitioning&#039; helps patients short term by providing them some relief from their symptoms of depression, anxiety, suicidal thoughts and body dysmorphia. However, after transitioning, suicide rates climb back up to pre-transitioning levels. Many hospitals and doctors will no longer perform sexual reassignment surgery for the reason it is not effective long term.<br><br>Some studies have shown that if the patient is given psychiatric counseling but not the reinforcing cosmetic therapies, that the Dysphoria may resolve on its own. The American College of Pediatricians has shown that when Gender Dysphoria occurs in pre-pubescent children, that the synrome resolves in the vast majority of patients by late adolescence.

Women, on the other hand, in the absence of birth control and abortion (which did not exist for more than 60 or so years out of the 250,000 our species has existed) spend a significant portion of their adult lives either pregnant or caring for very young children. This intrinsically limits their abilities to contribute to their tribal groups in other ways, and must have been a very powerful evolutionary pressure that shaped sexual dimorphism in our species. <br><br>Oh, and you betray your lack of support for your own position here:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;It is by it&#039;s nature a spectrum<\/span><br>If it&#039;s nature, it&#039;s not a social construct.<br><br>Points for double doubles, praise Kek, but you&#039;re just a subtle ausfailian troll.

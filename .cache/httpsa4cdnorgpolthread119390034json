Kids are individuals and don&#039;t always conform even with perfect guidance. Sometimes they&#039;ll see or hear things out of your control and will act up due to it. Spanking should be a last resort but to say that it has no place in parenting is retarded. Spanking should be used in conjunction with other methods and should never be used by itself as a disciplinary method and shouldn&#039;t be used on a child over the age of 10~ as it serves more harm than good at that point. <br>The problem with spanking isn&#039;t the act itself but shitty parents who use it as the go-to punishment and never explain why their child is being spanked. They usually spank too much and is accompanied by harsh yelling and blaming. Pure negative reinforcement which damages the child.

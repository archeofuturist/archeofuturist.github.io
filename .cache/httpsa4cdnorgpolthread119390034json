Those who are more successful than you, born into more wealth, into happier families and into more opportunity than you are raised in a way that does not psychologically abuse children and they are infinitely better off because of it. You are successful IN SPITE of your abuse, not BECAUSE of it. This is like stockholm syndrome because of the young age that your abuse began. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Why is it that kids in the past had the same type of abuse and they grew up to be more disciplined<\/span><br><br>Your wording of this is suspect - they did grow up more &quot;disciplined&quot; - more abused. They carried psychological baggage with them for their entire lives because of the rampant violent physical abuse that occurred in their childhoods and you can see the results in real time - more spousal abuse, more child abuse, more domestic violence, more alcoholism and violent behavior. Your perception of millennials being &quot;fairies&quot; is purely based on a feedback loop of ridiculous BS used by abusers to justify hitting children. Kids today are no different than they were 50 years ago and you are a fool to think otherwise because you see some faggot parents doing stupid spoiled shit to their kids.

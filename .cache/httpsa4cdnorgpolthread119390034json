Those who are more successful than you, born into more wealth, into happier families and into more opportunity than you are raised in a way that does not psychologically abuse children and they are infinitely better off because of it. You are successful IN SPITE of your abuse, not BECAUSE of it. This is like stockholm syndrome because of the young age that your abuse began. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Why is it that kids in the past had the same type of abuse and they grew up to be more disciplined<\/span><br><br>Your wording of this is suspect - they did grow up more &quot;disciplined&quot; - more abused. They carried psychological baggage with them for their entire lives because of the rampant violent physical abuse that occurred in their childhoods and you can see the results in real time - more spousal abuse, more child abuse, more domestic violence, more alcoholism and violent behavior. Your perception of millennials being &quot;fairies&quot; is purely based on a feedback loop of ridiculous BS used by abusers to justify hitting children. Kids today are no different than they were 50 years ago and you are a fool to think otherwise because you see some faggot parents doing stupid spoiled shit to their kids.

I&#039;ve beaten up so many kids i can&#039;t even remember the fights anymore. And i never started one fight - that&#039;s just the way it is living with niggers (white, black or otherwise). One fucker i even put a knife to his throat. I was 12 years old. Another kid, i nearly ripped his trachea out from his neck.","time":1491267886,"resto":119390034,"id":"5aZNoxKc","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119408701,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)21:05:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119407953\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119407953<\/a><br>There&#039;s is a difference between the sexual aspect of it and the disciplinary aspect of it and you have to separate those two.

The reason for all of this is because of childhood abuse, violent abuse, from someone who abused previously and indoctrinated to believe that it helps. I want your kids to turn out successful, happy and well adjusted but please believe me when I say that using violence against children is something that will affect them for the rest of their life in ways that permanently alter their brain - their relationships, their futures, and their children going forward.

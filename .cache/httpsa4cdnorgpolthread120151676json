All focus, then, is on the texts. On the opposite end, Catholics uphold authority in apostolic succession. They believe that the teaching authority Christ gave the apostles was passed down and begat things such as the Bible and oral teaching as well and such and still exists with their church now. Further, they uphold that prime apostle&#039;s office - Peter - and call the one in that seat the pope. Because of this Catholicism leans partially on a more established history of scholars and spiritual masters to establish their culture (not doctrine) rather than solely the scripture. Further, the Protestants believe that the Bible&#039;s canon was assembled authoritatively by the church through rational discourse on legitimacy and so have dismissed a few Old Testament books on the same grounds. Everyone else holds that rational discourse led to the decision but it was the clarification through church authority that made it authoritative. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Justification: They disagree on what makes one justified in preparation for salvation. Protestants believe that belief of God and trust in His teaching is what makes one just. It manifesting in your life is just a reaction to that.

Akin to a man with powers. They hold a view of God called Theistic Personalism. Catholicism allows such a view for laypeople because it is easy to understand but upholds a position called Classical Theism: where God is a willful ground of reality that is non-composite and non-competitive to creation. How miracles and the very attributes of God are understood differ wildly because of this distinction. Parts of Protestantism support Classical Theism but they are very vaguely applied.<\/span><br><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The Soul: Protestantism is largely understanding the soul as substance dualism. This is understanding the soul as a kind of immaterial substance interacting akin to matter. Catholicism understands the soul as hylomorphic dualism. This is understanding things in nature as a compound of matter and form (substantial form), with form being synonymous with soul in this manner of thought. I&#039;m not well-versed on the soul but that&#039;s an intro for you.<\/span>","filename":"1439188715194","ext":".jpg","w":907,"h":1280,"tn_w":88,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491673651432,"time":1491673651,"md5":"klRH6zEdbidGs691tcKzCA==","fsize":1194310,"resto":120151676,"id":"50vCALxj","country":"US","m_img":1,"trip":"!!tuOwy1ct2dy","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120158841,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)13:47:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120158634\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120158634<\/a><br>This chart is wrong and a bastardization done by the Jews themselves.","time":1491673657,"resto":120151676,"id":"EQjKCRcU","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120158878,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)13:47:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"This is the only guideline you need","filename":"Religions","ext":".png","w":727,"h":527,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":90,"tim":1491673679508,"time":1491673679,"md5":"1vm3B5NDeuZxd4TQBY1OXA==","fsize":147583,"resto":120151676,"id":"NblKY1sP","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120159063,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)13:49:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"The main strand of protestantism claims that human beings are basically meat puppets and nothing anyone ever does will ever matter.

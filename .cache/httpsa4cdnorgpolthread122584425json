Give him who asks you, and do not turn away from him who will borrow from you.<br>Ye have heard, that is, thou shalt love thy neighbor, and hate thy enemy. I, but I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless those who curse you, do those who hate you, and pray for those who persecute you, and persecute you, that you may be sons of your Father who are in heaven.

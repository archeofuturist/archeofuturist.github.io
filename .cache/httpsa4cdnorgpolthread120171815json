But in the event that I brought up a child, I would be strongly tempted to put them through Church. <br><br>Even as an atheist\/agnostic or whatever, with the world being such a chaotic and destructive place, I would want my daughter to have a stable upbringing, one with real friends and careful peers, not running around chasing drugs and sex.<br><br>I&#039;d hope that their study of the Bible turned them into a good woman, and gave them in turn a good man. That they also had good children themselves, and they also offered a place for bad people who wanted to be good, and helped them to also be good people again.<br><br>But would it all be pointlessly hypocritical because I&#039;m an atheist? That I would just be using religion as a means to an end? I don&#039;t believe in any kind of afterlife and do not believe men are significantly better than animals at best. I would be the devil to my daughter.<br><br>Has anybody else been in this situation? Can you tell me- is the Church worth it?","filename":"1","ext":".jpg","w":852,"h":480,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1491680078146,"time":1491680078,"md5":"VmCurkJ4FwqfDXl853LLtg==","fsize":89947,"resto":0,"id":"riphFBp7","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"i-want-to-speak-to-christians-on-a-personal-level","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":4,"images":1,"unique_ips":3},{"no":120172153,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)15:37:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Credo<wbr>_ut_intelligam","time":1491680237,"resto":120171815,"id":"W38Zwq3\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120172647,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)15:41:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"Jesus loves you, Anon.<br><br>No need to fake it.

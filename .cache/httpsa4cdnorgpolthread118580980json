You can think of it like as as a similar concept to Amish communities. The overall structure of government will follow some of Curtis Yarvin&#039;s ideas, and is shown below:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;1) We will create a cryptocurrency known as the Kekcoin. This Kekcoin will have the same amount of value as square meters of land owned (Read: 1 square meter of land = 1 Kekcoin). The idea stems from the German Rentenmark. This way, our currency will be the very first one which is backed by actual goods: land.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;2) People who are eligible to live in the MPoK will have to buy those coins, go to the location, and claim a piece of land in relation to how many Kekcoins he spends.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;3) Not everybody will be eligible to live there, but even if you are not eligible, you can invest in the MPoK. In addition, you will be free to speculate with our crypto in an exchange. <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;4) How to introduce the crypto is yet to be discussed.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;5) We have found land as cheap as 10710.41 hectares for $5,900,000 USD. This means that our cryptocurrency will issue the exact amount of 107,104,100 coins.

Pandering to middle america with them stupid hats, talking about conspiracy theories and shit. He even hired white nationalist Steve Bannon as chief advisor just to put the icing on the cake. Fast forward to 4 months later: He didn&#039;t repeal Obamacare, and already broke several campaign promises. And they demoted Bannon in favor of his son-in-law Jared Kushner (married to Ivanka), a practicing orthodox jew with connections to none other than :::drum roll please::: the world&#039;s biggest globalist of them all, George Soros. Make no mistake, the war in Syria is about taking over the oil and natural gas-rich Golan Heights, and further expanding the Israeli empire. Why do you think we fight so many wars in the middle east? Why do you think Trump hired ex-CEO of Exxon Mobile as Secretary of State? The sarin gas attacks were a false flag promoted by the CIA, state-run propaganda media, in order to flex to the eastern world and raise tensions with Russia and North Korea. The United States has been especially harsh on Russia in the past year because Putin is trying to nationalize their central bank, so that it would be completely independent, unlike now, where they borrow money from London, and follow orders given by the Federal Reserve in accordance with the petro dollar. It also has to do with Russia flexing by taking Crimea and trying to secure an oil\/natural gas line of its own through Europe and the Middle East.","filename":"1487970152148","ext":".jpg","w":1200,"h":1600,"tn_w":187,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492498705672,"time":1492498705,"md5":"F9nKLXSEpCjFaYRFZltbJw==","fsize":184397,"resto":0,"id":"vCn92cFg","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"trump-finessed-everybody-pandering-to-middle","country_name":"United States","replies":8,"images":2,"unique_ips":9},{"no":121652334,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)02:59:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121652232\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121652232<\/a><br>That underwear is so far up her ass.

The mainstream media sure as hell ain\u2019t going to tell you. All of the major media outlets in the US, including all of the movie studios, are owned and operated by zionsist jews. You wanted to know who are the illuminati, just follow the money \u2026.and the bloodline. Did you know Obama is actually related to George Bush?? All of the US presidents, as well as all of the royal families in Europe share the same family tree (the Davidic line), stemming from a group of jewish people living in Germany, that descended from King David in Isael. Explains why jews and royals only intermarry with one another. So while you out here debating partisan politics and the existence of God, evil is out here working overtime.","filename":"1487964843469","ext":".jpg","w":1080,"h":1080,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492500051792,"time":1492500051,"md5":"E5sV2DrMdWl8VvyEwncUJA==","fsize":199394,"resto":121652232,"id":"AQRacTRw","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":121653910,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)03:22:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121652232\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121652232<\/a><br>is your enter key broken?<br>saged you autist, and stop doing drugs","time":1492500176,"resto":121652232,"id":"lAa8Bj8k","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121654275,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)03:28:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121653910\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121653910<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;needing reddit spacing<\/span>","time":1492500495,"resto":121652232,"id":"IulouUv4","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121654705,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)03:35:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121652232\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121652232<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;white nationalist<\/span><br>Not a crime<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;didn&#039;t repeal Obamacare<\/span><br>Yet<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;broke promises<\/span><br>You expect campaign promises to all be kept?<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;A Jew<\/span><br>Only \/pol\/ cares about that, being Jewish isn&#039;t a crime either.

The board is filled with anons who have been manipulated into spending their lives searching for conspiracies lead by (them), paralyzed by the fear that our physical and moral world is collapsing around us, and feeding on predigested pseudo-intellectual garbage fed to them by some circlejerk youtuber.<br><br>It is not possible to discuss politics and the subjects that truly matters when you&#039;re not your genuine self.

The problems you have, Jesus had too. Through him you will find help and guidance on how to reconnect with your self and the real world.

My thoughts are based on my experience and my experience has led me to believe Africans and Mexicans are hostile to my way of life, and I should do what I can to avoid being placed in a predicament that involves said subhumans from interfering in my life in a negative way. If it&#039;s racist for me to want to live because blacks and latinos want to kill me for not being black or latino then call me a racist. I would rather be called a name than be killed brutally by some chimp or gang banger.","time":1491611395,"resto":120053828,"id":"XbRYWlYO","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

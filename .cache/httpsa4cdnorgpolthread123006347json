Just curious. <br><br>They made Captain America a Hydra agent and now he&#039;s wielding Thor&#039;s Hammer and all. I don&#039;t read the comics, but a lot of fans are pissed because they think that Marvel is just churning out Nazi propaganda now by subverting a character that was originally created by Jews as anti-Nazi propaganda. As I understand it, Hydra=Nazis right?","filename":"image","ext":".png","w":640,"h":646,"tn_w":247,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493275427677,"time":1493275427,"md5":"RdnNoiD2667YxVFnyatddQ==","fsize":786855,"resto":0,"id":"PqoIRmA8","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"hey-so-question-for-natsoc-you-guys-big-fans-of","country_name":"United States","replies":16,"images":1,"unique_ips":14},{"no":123006498,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)02:45:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123006347\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123006347<\/a><br>No.<br>Comic books are fucking gay.

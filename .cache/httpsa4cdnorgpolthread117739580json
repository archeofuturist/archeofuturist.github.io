Unless a unified people exists, the state will forever be overly bureaucratic and stratified. From what I understand, Hindi is the national language, but virtually no one in the South speaks it. Hiring millions of bureaucrats to not only handle regional languages but also producing goods and services (signage, systems etc) in all languages is an unneeded strain on any government. Regional factionalism is pretty bad too, seeing how there isn&#039;t much to bind Indian citizens (Hinduism isn&#039;t that strong a tool unless an external force, like Muslims, are in the area. Hinduism isn&#039;t an organised religion). China can progress no problem because its unified in language, race and government (no democracy).<br><br><br>2. Get rid of democracy for a decade or two. Pick up Sun Yet Sen&#039;s &quot;Three Principles of the People&quot; and put the country under &quot;Tutorage&quot;, where democracy is temporarily suspended in favour of education. Having millions of scheduled peoples and dozens of different races\/castes all voting for their interests isn&#039;t productive.","time":1490172809,"resto":117739580,"id":"948ypJ0v","country":"SG","country_name":"Singapore"},{"no":117740374,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)04:55:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117739580\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117739580<\/a><br>1.

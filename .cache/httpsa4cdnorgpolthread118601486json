Social structures can exist for a short period of time without developing a culture, but I must insist that the human condition will always create culture within social structure. Without social structure there is no culture, and without culture social structure feels merely temporary. Culture evolves over years of tradition, tradition evolves over common practices within social structure. It is natural for culture to form as it is the human condition. Sure, you can wipe out a culture, and start a new social structure, but your original plan to have no culture will be lost within a generation or two.","time":1490670832,"resto":118601486,"id":"trTrFKik","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118605390,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)23:32:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"The question was - Why does culture matter?<br><br>I think the answer is that it does not.

I only care that people who want to yell at me about tranny problems are also attempting to change the scientific understanding of gender. <br><br>You&#039;re not a woman stuck in a man&#039;s body (or vice versa). You&#039;re just suffering from a type of dysphoria. There are people who wake up everyday thinking their arms or legs don&#039;t actually belong to them. We don&#039;t congratulate them for being themselves, we help them understand that the brain is not infallible and that their arms and legs really do belong to them.<br><br>I think the LGBT community is against this idea because it puts trans people under the same umbrella as people with downs or MS. Granted, our current system doesn&#039;t do alot to help people like that, but you shouldn&#039;t deny facts.<br><br>ALSO, the gender conversation right now is a fucking joke. The only reason gender roles still exist is because the LGBT community continues to assert that they do. Being male doesn&#039;t mean you HAVE to act a certain way, but it does mean that you are male. But the LGBT community keeps attaching behaviors and actions to the labels of male and female then turning around and punting at it like it&#039;s always been there.<br><br>TL;DR: Stop trying to throw away facts just because they make you feel bad.","time":1493947597,"resto":124140388,"id":"RgH1BbCB","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

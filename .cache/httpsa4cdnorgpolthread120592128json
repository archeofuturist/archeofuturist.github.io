The report portrayed the governor as paranoid and obsessed with trying to keep the relationship secret.<br><br>The committee on Monday started what was expected to be days of hearings leading to a vote on possible impeachment, but Bentley&#039;s departure stopped the process cold. He invoked his Christian faith during a farewell address in the Capitol.","filename":"Bentley","ext":".jpg","w":1600,"h":1015,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":158,"tim":1491913982523,"time":1491913982,"md5":"HqlZdeh8REALVSBzcpZDDQ==","fsize":330309,"resto":0,"id":"RQrT\/oSi","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"gay-hating-governor-resigns-in-alabama","country_name":"United States","replies":3,"images":0,"unique_ips":4},{"no":120592718,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)08:39:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120592128\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120592128<\/a><br>bump","time":1491914342,"resto":120592128,"id":"RHKDV\/h4","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120592871,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)08:40:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120592128\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120592128<\/a><br>Deflection &amp; smokescreens<br>It&#039;s like virtue signalling for conservatives","time":1491914435,"resto":120592128,"id":"ou7W\/aBt","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":120592945,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)08:41:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120592128\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120592128<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Why are those most critical of other people&#039;s sexual degeneracy usually the biggest hypocrites about it themselves?<\/span><br>Jesus makes people retarded.","time":1491914484,"resto":120592128,"id":"oM4ABbAx","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

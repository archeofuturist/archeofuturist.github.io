Very accepting of non-believers, something similar to the Unitarian churches these days. Egotist or not, I have a feeling that a church that allows me to feel or do anything and just pray about it doesn&#039;t sit well with me. I do want some guidance, but I do need them to be open-minded as I tend to not be as literal, at least not yet.","time":1490594188,"resto":118473969,"id":"cjm9FS\/O","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118479319,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)01:57:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118473969\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118473969<\/a><br>Whichever one makes you feel like giving money to a church, tax free.","time":1490594238,"resto":118473969,"id":"3Ht3JX11","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118479321,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)01:57:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118473969\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118473969<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;king james is garbage<\/span><br><br>only if your an uneducated swine","time":1490594240,"resto":118473969,"id":"HSYpc\/Ea","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118479388,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)01:58:08","name":"Amplified Translation","com":"<a href=\"#p118479321\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118479321<\/a><br>you&#039;re*<br><br>Satan tempted me to do it.","time":1490594288,"resto":118473969,"id":"rFxhzV6E","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118479405,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)01:58:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118473969\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118473969<\/a><br>Catholic is the only way.

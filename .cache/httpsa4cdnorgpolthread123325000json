It is hard for you to make sense on any given level. Yourself is fabricated, an aberration. You are a noncontingent human being. Your personality is sketchy and unformed, your heartlessness goes deep and is persistent. Your conscience, your pity, your hopes disappeared a long time ago (probably at Harvard) if they ever did exist. There are no more barriers to cross. All you have in common with the uncontrollable and the insane, the vicious and the evil, all the mayhem you have caused and you utter indifference toward it, You have now surpassed. You still, though, hold on to one single bleak truth: no one is safe, nothing is redeemed. Yet you are blameless. Each model of human behavior must be assumed to have some validity. Is evil something you are? Or is it something you do? Your pain is constant and sharp and you do not hope for a better world for anyone. In fact, you want your pain to be inflicted on others. You want no one to escape. But even after admitting this\u2014and you have countless times, in just about every act you&#039;ve committed\u2014and coming face-to-face with these truths, there is no catharsis. You gain no deeper knowledge about yourself, no new understanding can be extracted from your telling. There has been no reason for me to tell you any of this.

They say that the world is false, without foundation and without God and that it is born of no cause other than of lust.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;9. With this vision in their minds, the degenerated souls, with little intelligence, engage in hostile activities, for the destruction of the world against its interests.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;10. Resorting to insatiable lust, with conceited minds, possessed by insane energy, residing in untruthful words, under illusion, they exist, worshipping the unclean and the impure.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;11. With endless anxieties (tormenting them) till the end, absorbed in sense gratification and concluding it as the transcendental (or divine).<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;12. Bound by innumerable strings of desire, minds filled with the vibrations of anger and lust, they accumulate wealth by unjust means, desiring sense gratification.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;15. I am wealthy and from a rich family, who else can there be like me! I perform sacrifices, give charity and also enjoy - ( saying ) thus by ignorance (the demonic) are deluded.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;16. Perplexed by numerous states of thinking, caught in the net of illusion, attached to the gratification of desires, the unclean degenerate into hell.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;17. Egoistic, impudent, possessed with insane energy of wealth and pride, they perform sacrifices for name sake only out of conceit and against established procedures.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;18. Having taken shelter in egoism, strength, showiness, lust and anger, the envious discredit Me in their own bodies and in others.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;19. These haters, the cruel and the lowest men in the world of materialistic existence, I cast them again and again into the inauspicious demonic wombs.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;20. Acquiring demonic wombs, these deluded persons, birth after birth, without reaching Me, O Kaunteya, go to the lowest hell.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;21. Three types are the gates to this hell which are destructive to the soul - desire, anger and greed. Therefore one must leave aside these three.<\/span>","filename":"krishna-arjuna","ext":".jpg","w":1000,"h":600,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":150,"tim":1493278883992,"time":1493278883,"md5":"2CBGKgdrYsyGtPCBq2IeJA==","fsize":27551,"resto":0,"id":"56Hid56d","country":"DE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"turns-out-the-bhagavad-gita-describes-both","country_name":"Germany","replies":10,"images":1,"unique_ips":4},{"no":123010903,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)03:45:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"did krishna poo in the loo?","time":1493279128,"resto":123010611,"id":"87vq70dj","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":123011046,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)03:47:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123010903\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123010903<\/a><br>He probably didn&#039;t have to.","filename":"bill-nye-creationism-615x345","ext":".png","w":615,"h":345,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1493279243263,"time":1493279243,"md5":"ZTSZT0y\/QUDEzAa4nqjgdQ==","fsize":146989,"resto":123010611,"id":"56Hid56d","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":123011356,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)03:51:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"congratulations dude<br>you&#039;re the first person in history to ever willfully misinterpret a holy book in order to further his political goals<br>someone call the guinness book of world records people","time":1493279511,"resto":123010611,"id":"ZFxjwFlN","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123011729,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)03:56:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123011356\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123011356<\/a><br>Clearly it talks about angry degenerates from rich families who virtue signal alot while engaging in materialism, buying the newest Iphones while thinking their phony donations to the cause make up for it.","time":1493279805,"resto":123010611,"id":"56Hid56d","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":123011958,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)03:59:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123011729\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123011729<\/a><br>right. they&#039;re called &quot;pharisees&quot; in the Gospel but you get the idea.","time":1493279977,"resto":123010611,"id":"ZFxjwFlN","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123012107,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)04:01:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123011958\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123011958<\/a><br>Were the pharisees just hypocrites or greedy as well?","time":1493280096,"resto":123010611,"id":"56Hid56d","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":123012172,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)04:02:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123010611\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123010611<\/a><br>Sounds like someone who came into contact with a Jew-like presence thousands of years ago","time":1493280152,"resto":123010611,"id":"iOxSDZt8","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123012349,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)04:04:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123012172\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123012172<\/a><br>Wanna hear some little secret as well?

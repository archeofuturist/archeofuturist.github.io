Empty consumer capitalism. Terrorism. Permanent war. End of economic opportunity and civil rights. Death of the last great men of history. I was probably going to kill myself in my 20s because of how blackpilled I was. All there was to do was shitpost on an anime website filled with lolbergs, nazis, and whoever else was typing weird shit on the other side of the keyboard. Europe is being flooded with muslims. Whites are being outbred everywhere. My home is being gentrified by chinks and pakis.<br><br>And here comes along this aryan avatar who stirs up the biggest fucking shitstorm I&#039;ve ever seen and btfos these neocohens and globalist jews on a daily basis. We get a modern Napoleon. He&#039;s going to spearhead a cultural revolution in the West and use his position crusade against these fucking parasites and Marxists.<br><br>And he stabs me right in the fucking back for his first 100 days in office. To some of you newfags, its probably no-harm no-foul because you didn&#039;t experience 4 years straight of blackpilling, only to see a light at the end of the tunnel and smarmy jew throw a tarp on it when you were just about there.","filename":"e88[1]","ext":".png","w":509,"h":411,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":100,"tim":1491911541296,"time":1491911541,"md5":"box\/kLO2S\/O14BigbqlYxQ==","fsize":33379,"resto":120586607,"id":"WN4sakvc","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120588624,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)07:54:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"I&#039;m so done with Trump, these tweets this morning are too much, he ain&#039;t coming back","filename":"image","ext":".jpg","w":576,"h":127,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":27,"tim":1491911665894,"time":1491911665,"md5":"vQSbSVT8Y1mGcRjaFPGDgQ==","fsize":27868,"resto":120586607,"id":"yn6Nok60","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120588673,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)07:55:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120588444\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120588444<\/a><br>honestly I&#039;m not nearly as far right as you, but I voted for him and I also have fallen away from him since, it&#039;s pretty strange looking back now, I can&#039;t quite identify why I pinned so much hope on a single man on a tv screen","time":1491911704,"resto":120586607,"id":"SDqUfSKr","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120589068,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)07:59:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120588444\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120588444<\/a><br>This, not to mention that T_D and shills came out swinging during the Syrian bombing shitfest, they weren&#039;t even trying to be \/pol\/-like.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Protip: \/sg\/ existed way before \/ptg\/.

If we had a world war tomorrow, nobody would want to fight. Nobody gives a shit. When you have nothing to die for, you have nothing to live for. People just live in America to try and make some money, live under a law system that sort of works, send their kids to an OK school, and go shopping at strip malls. This is nihilism, even if people don&#039;t know it. <br><br>Society has definitely fallen away from Christianity. Churches are corrupt with weak and cucked pastors. So even if somebody is trying to go to church, they&#039;re not getting anything out of it because the pastor is usually a massive faggot buried in debt, so he&#039;s afraid to preach anything controversial because he needs to make money. Also most Christians these days are weak pussies and they don&#039;t even know what the Bible says anymore. <br><br>Then politics just sucks. Left\/right want to kill each other and have nothing in common, and our politicians are completely corrupt. Everybody knows it too. <br><br>Art\/music\/film is just depressing. Even the underground stuff sucks. People aren&#039;t excited about it, it&#039;s just kinda... there. Metal has gone stale, rock is boring, bluegrass has gone stale, classical is a niche genre at this point, hip hop is only enjoyed by uncultured faggots and tumblrtards<br><br>Everybody knows acadamia is a scam. The teachers are lazy\/on a power trip, the curriculum is usually lame. But you need it to get a job. <br><br>Basically everything is shit, people are just kinda... floating. Theres no meaning in anything anymore. Every institution has become a joke and a laughing stock. Even marriage.","filename":"IMG_7893","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":633,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":154,"tim":1491990283500,"time":1491990283,"md5":"9atSNKGI8l0iZ5yp3JOmhw==","fsize":112723,"resto":0,"id":"Yx3fY9cq","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"america-in-a-nihilist-slump","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

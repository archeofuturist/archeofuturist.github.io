If we had a world war tomorrow, nobody would want to fight. Nobody gives a shit. When you have nothing to die for, you have nothing to live for. People just live in America to try and make some money, live under a law system that sort of works, send their kids to an OK school, and go shopping at strip malls. This is nihilism, even if people don&#039;t know it. <br><br>Society has definitely fallen away from Christianity. Churches are corrupt with weak and cucked pastors. So even if somebody is trying to go to church, they&#039;re not getting anything out of it because the pastor is usually a massive faggot buried in debt, so he&#039;s afraid to preach anything controversial because he needs to make money. Also most Christians these days are weak pussies and they don&#039;t even know what the Bible says anymore. <br><br>Then politics just sucks. Left\/right want to kill each other and have nothing in common, and our politicians are completely corrupt. Everybody knows it too. <br><br>Art\/music\/film is just depressing. Even the underground stuff sucks. People aren&#039;t excited about it, it&#039;s just kinda... there. Metal has gone stale, rock is boring, bluegrass has gone stale, classical is a niche genre at this point, hip hop is only enjoyed by uncultured faggots and tumblrtards<br><br>Everybody knows acadamia is a scam. The teachers are lazy\/on a power trip, the curriculum is usually lame. But you need it to get a job. <br><br>Basically everything is shit, people are just kinda... floating. Theres no meaning in anything anymore. Every institution has become a joke and a laughing stock. Even marriage.","filename":"IMG_7893","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":633,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":154,"tim":1491990283500,"time":1491990283,"md5":"9atSNKGI8l0iZ5yp3JOmhw==","fsize":112723,"resto":0,"id":"Yx3fY9cq","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"america-in-a-nihilist-slump","country_name":"United States","replies":52,"images":5,"unique_ips":12},{"no":120738079,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)05:49:09","name":"Anonymous","filename":"IMG_7958","ext":".jpg","w":480,"h":342,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":89,"tim":1491990549206,"time":1491990549,"md5":"nHsecezaxx6YnJ9uSnoJzQ==","fsize":59051,"resto":120737803,"id":"Yx3fY9cq","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120738221,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)05:51:31","name":"Anonymous","filename":"IMG_7952","ext":".jpg","w":674,"h":672,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":124,"tim":1491990691449,"time":1491990691,"md5":"i+Wm\/tZDkyPMM3QBzaNgoA==","fsize":111869,"resto":120737803,"id":"Yx3fY9cq","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120738300,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)05:52:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"you think that&#039;s bad..<br>just wait until you&#039;re stuck inside your RealityChamber\u00a9 and CANTWAKEUP.png","time":1491990765,"resto":120737803,"id":"l0+73jCX","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120738556,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)05:56:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120737803\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120737803<\/a><br>You&#039;ve outlined it perfectly: the outside world matters not one bit.

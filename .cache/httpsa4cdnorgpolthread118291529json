Now *that* is a slippery slope nobody wants to go down:<br><br>This slogan means: You are saying society should pay the mind of a chanting 12 year old (who is very very probably only chanting because his parents went to the protest and he was invited &quot;so people hear the voice of the children&quot;. &quot;Won&#039;t somebody think of the children&quot;) the same attention and should weigh it in a similar way as the mind of an adult old enough to vote?<br><br>Do you really want to go down that route? Because I don&#039;t think you want to go down that road.<br><br>There is reasons why we don&#039;t care about 12 year old children opinion on certain topics. Children are stupid, easily manipulated fuckers that don&#039;t know shit. (Yeah, it depends of course. If you want to know about Herobrine or the latest 150 Pokemon sure, go ahead and ask them.).","filename":"2017-02-14 07_13_55-\u30dd\u30ea\u30b9\u30de\u30f3\uff0fGAL\u7537\u5ba3\u8a00 - YouTube","ext":".png","w":711,"h":877,"tn_w":202,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490485989558,"time":1490485989,"md5":"IDvlsGdVlbfudmFvlgffGg==","fsize":846236,"resto":0,"id":"PCmMkPIC","country":"DE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"too-young-to-vote-old-enough-to-care","country_name":"Germany","replies":2,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":118293331,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)20:08:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118291529\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118291529<\/a><br>It&#039;s a blatant attempt to indoctrinate young children into a particular political stance.

I only make $65K, which is more than many, but not as much as it sounds. I live in New York, and am paid twice per month. After benefits and 401K stuff, I take home $1,700 every fifteen days. <br><br>I did the math on Trump&#039;s proposed tax plan during the campaign. It would let me keep another $300 every fucking paycheck. $7,000 per year.<br><br>That&#039;s not a huge difference to everyone, but fuck me if it isn&#039;t for me. That&#039;s money I can use to seriously ease some burdens around here. That&#039;s my car payment, insurance, cell phone, and credit cards PAID, every single month, and the only difference is that the fucking government isn&#039;t taking so damn much up front. Yes, we lose the standard deduction ($6,350), but like hell do I ever get that much back anyway. I&#039;m lucky if I can get $2K--and I mean REALLY lucky. So, assuming that they still collect the right amounts and I don&#039;t owe anything when I file my taxes, I have a net increase of about $5K, a little over $400 per month. <br><br>If that (or something close to it) is what he passes? I&#039;m pretty much ready to elect him as Emperor for Life.","time":1490929222,"resto":119003533,"id":"ytQK\/v5w","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119010556,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)23:00:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119010470\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119010470<\/a><br>Nah everyone&#039;s laughing pretty hard and Trump is basically the new word for idiot.","time":1490929244,"resto":119003533,"id":"BCs3VRCw","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119010657,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)23:01:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119003533\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119003533<\/a><br>I was always a randy guy myself","time":1490929308,"resto":119003533,"id":"u\/vXYj\/F","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119010689,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)23:02:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119004696\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119004696<\/a><br>Bro that was straight reddit shit","time":1490929325,"resto":119003533,"id":"07rEg2tx","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119010762,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)23:02:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119010503\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119010503<\/a><br>One of the best things I ever did was move out of NY.

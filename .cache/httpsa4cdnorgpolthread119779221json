As a present, my dad gave me a basket full of beer he had brewed himself and this letter:<br><br>&quot;Buddy, at this point all you can do is give up and accept that life isn&#039;t going to be the way it was 60 years ago. Don&#039;t save for retirement, don&#039;t have kids, if you get married, be damned sure that she won&#039;t divorce you (you really shouldn&#039;t get married).<br><br>Don&#039;t even aspire for higher wages, because that just results in higher taxes. Would you rather make 25k working part time with a 15 percent tax (netting you 21250, plus government benefits) or 50k working full time with a 40 percent tax (netting you 30k, plus no benefits)?<br><br>Enjoy what you can, anon. Friends, family, and small things, like used cars, motorcycles, video games etc.<br><br>We have 130 trillion dollars in unfunded liabilities. That is literally double what the entire world produced last year.<br><br>Just sit back, and let it all go. Stop fighting it. It sucks, but it isn&#039;t your fault. You aren&#039;t responsible for the way that this country turned out. So sit back, enjoy your family, your friends, your hobbies, and work the system as best as you can (as there is no shame in this anymore; thanks to democrats, it is less honorable to be productive than it is to leech on society).<br><br>And most importantly, be happy. Go ahead and take a vacation to a national park. Go rock climbing, or drive a motorcycle across the nation. By getting out there and enjoying life, you are winning. The government can&#039;t confiscate that, like they can retirement accounts, bank accounts, or property, and you are enjoying life, something the extreme left is incapable of doing. Feminists don&#039;t enjoy their life. Black rights activists aren&#039;t ever happy. They&#039;ve devoted their lives to being perpetually unhappy, and are doing their damnest to spread it to you.<br><br>So don&#039;t let them win. You can&#039;t change the political spectrum. You can&#039;t force productivity. But you can find happiness in any situation.<br><br>Happy birthday, son!&quot;<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Thoughts?<\/span>","filename":"1404933706640","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":600,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491505852516,"time":1491505852,"md5":"rQtyKTowgOmpFybDwU1mhA==","fsize":64513,"resto":0,"id":"TkrPagMu","country":"DE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"i-just-turned-25-as-a-present-my-dad-gave-me-a","country_name":"Germany","replies":93,"images":16,"unique_ips":79},{"no":119779359,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)15:11:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119779221\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119779221<\/a><br><br>good guy dad, speakin the truth, need more like him","time":1491505911,"resto":119779221,"id":"VfEbHVd\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119779746,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)15:14:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119779221\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119779221<\/a><br>Thanks, but no thanks.

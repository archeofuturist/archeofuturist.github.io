Now I see every alternative news outlet as only an agenda with no regards to facts, no respect to differing opinions, and no lenience to counter-facts and logic, and I now see this in everything people say: No one is without an agenda or a plan to change something in their world. You will be likely much older before you find someone truly self-less and detached without being in the extreme of isolation that the internet offers and supports for so many. Once I learned to doubt, and now discard, how Nazi Germany handled the Jews as it was told to me to be above question, and now I question why no one else questions it. I question how I even compute &#039;facts&#039; nowadays, and its to the point that I find, or think I find, tethers from every single person to the media; to their virtues; and, to history as it has been told.<br><br>Idk, I&#039;m not edgy about it, but it is interesting and I wonder if anyone else is at this point.","time":1490877487,"resto":118916720,"id":"ZuxUPICw","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"}]}

Bismarck especially listened to Hermann Wagener and Theodor Lohmann, advisers who persuaded him to give workers a corporate status in the legal and political structures of the new German state.[79] In March 1884, Bismarck declared:<br><br>\u201c The real grievance of the worker is the insecurity of his existence; he is not sure that he will always have work, he is not sure that he will always be healthy, and he foresees that he will one day be old and unfit to work. If he falls into poverty, even if only through a prolonged illness, he is then completely helpless, left to his own devices, and society does not currently recognize any real obligation towards him beyond the usual help for the poor, even if he has been working all the time ever so faithfully and diligently. The usual help for the poor, however, leaves a lot to be desired, especially in large cities, where it is very much worse than in the country.[80]","filename":"Bismark","ext":".jpg","w":330,"h":440,"tn_w":93,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492057446746,"time":1492057446,"md5":"a67KM0vDoOjFfAQVcQLOjg==","fsize":34218,"resto":120860170,"id":"zzlw\/mcj","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120866064,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)00:24:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120865114\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120865114<\/a><br>They also redrew district lines dumb fuck.

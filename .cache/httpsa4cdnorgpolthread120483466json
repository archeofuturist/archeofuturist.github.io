The hypothesis goes further, saying that the depot contained phosgene and chlorine gas, but not Sarin. The wind carried these released gases among civilian homes and streets in Khan Sheikhoun. People suffered and died. Evidence for the absence of Sarin gas is that the gassing victims were handled manually by doctors and aid workers in street clothes. Sarin can kill on skin contact and doctors have to treat it in protective gear. So, maybe the gas wasn\u2019t Sarin and maybe it wasn\u2019t dropped in bombs from Assad\u2019s planes.","time":1491855251,"resto":120483466,"id":"Go3Wxg6I","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120483963,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)16:14:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120483632\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120483632<\/a><br>oh shit i think its time to remove him from power in that case. maybe we could make a safe zone, under israeli control in syria? you know just to help the refugees go home and things to settle down.","time":1491855262,"resto":120483466,"id":"YST3y6LQ","country":"HU","country_name":"Hungary"},{"no":120483975,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)16:14:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120483466\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120483466<\/a><br>because there&#039;s no rothschild central bank there yet, that&#039;s why.","time":1491855266,"resto":120483466,"id":"RiO\/ZKBg","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120484011,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)16:14:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120483466\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120483466<\/a><br>It was done by Soros to fuel a new media narrative against Trump.

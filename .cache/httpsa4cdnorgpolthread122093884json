There&#039;s not much in Greenwood where I live, but Indianapolis is only half an hour away. There, you&#039;ll find good bars, museums, and a really overlooked war memorial. Most of the state is huge swathes of rural areas with a few cities scattered in between. Bloomington is a nice town further south. There&#039;s an eclectic mix of cultures in the state; Generally, you&#039;ll hear Southern accents in Martinsville and anywhere south of it, midwestern most anywhere else. Lots of colleges and universities as well, which is where most of the liberalism is concentrated. Indianapolis and Gary are nigger enclaves, but the state has very good gun laws and you&#039;ll probably never have a reason to go to Gary. Throughout the state, rent and property values are cheap, and even the densest parts of the cities are nowhere near the urban hellscape found in places like Chicago or New York (except Gary, fuck Gary).<br><br>Geographically, it is an extremely flat state in the northern and middle parts. The southern parts are hilly, and contain many cave systems and parks. One of the best is Brown County State Park. If you like the the outdoors and hiking, it&#039;s worth the trip. In the north are the sand dunes and the Great Lake, but the water is usually pretty polluted. Throughout Indiana, as a general rule of thumb, you&#039;ll find a church every mile or so. <br><br>Anyways, thats the rundown from a lifetime resident. There&#039;s a reason Indiana is #1 in both meth production and high-school suicides, but it&#039;s really not too bad of a place.","filename":"takbir","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":879,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":107,"tim":1492767031468,"time":1492767031,"md5":"UQGo48i0ZLoI0obB64Afzg==","fsize":271602,"resto":122093884,"id":"FOK\/88S0","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122118790,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)05:42:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122093884\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122093884<\/a><br>I didn&#039;t live in Indiana very long before I moved.

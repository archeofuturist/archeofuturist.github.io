In which case what are you doing dating them in the first place?<br><br>&quot;Turner syndrome is a chromosomal condition that affects development in females. The most common feature of Turner syndrome is short stature, which becomes evident by about age 5. An early loss of ovarian function (ovarian hypofunction or premature ovarian failure) is also very common. The ovaries develop normally at first, but egg cells (oocytes) usually die prematurely and most ovarian tissue degenerates before birth. Many affected girls do not undergo puberty unless they receive hormone therapy, and most are unable to conceive (infertile). A small percentage of females with Turner syndrome retain normal ovarian function through young adulthood.&quot;<br><br>&quot;About 30 percent of females with Turner syndrome have extra folds of skin on the neck (webbed neck), a low hairline at the back of the neck, puffiness or swelling (lymphedema) of the hands and feet, skeletal abnormalities, or kidney problems. One third to one half of individuals with Turner syndrome are born with a heart defect, such as a narrowing of the large artery leaving the heart (coarctation of the aorta) or abnormalities of the valve that connects the aorta with the heart (the aortic valve). Complications associated with these heart defects can be life-threatening.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Most girls and women with Turner syndrome have normal intelligence. Developmental delays, nonverbal learning disabilities, and behavioral problems are possible, although these characteristics vary among affected individuals.&quot;","time":1493314900,"resto":123054111,"id":"SxANIJIb","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123062198,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)13:42:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123061888\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123061888<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;They were BORN with a fully functional vagina leaf<\/span><br><br>So they&#039;re women, not trannies.","time":1493314939,"resto":123054111,"id":"vucN\/ja8","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123062205,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)13:42:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123054111\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123054111<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;TFW your language has only one word for gender instead of separated &quot;gender&quot; and &quot;sex&quot;. <\/span><br>Feels \u0445opo\u0448o, man","time":1493314941,"resto":123054111,"id":"DwAc5w2a","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":123062315,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)13:43:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123061638\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123061638<\/a><br>Those are physiological disorders, and exceptions to the norm aren&#039;t relevant to broad standards.

Several studies have looked for signs that transgender people have brains more similar to their experienced gender. Spanish investigators\u2014led by psychobiologist Antonio Guillamon of the National Distance Education University in Madrid and neuropsychologist Carme Junqu\u00e9 Plaja of the University of Barcelona\u2014used MRI to examine the brains of 24 female-to-males and 18 male-to-females\u2014both before and after treatment with cross-sex hormones. Their results, published in 2013, showed that even before treatment the brain structures of the trans people were more similar in some respects to the brains of their experienced gender than those of their natal gender. For example, the female-to-male subjects had relatively thin subcortical areas (these areas tend to be thinner in men than in women). Male-to-female subjects tended to have thinner cortical regions in the right hemisphere, which is characteristic of a female brain. (Such differences became more pronounced after treatment.)<\/span><br><br>https:\/\/www.scientificamerican.com\/<wbr>article\/is-there-something-unique-a<wbr>bout-the-transgender-brain\/","time":1493317290,"resto":123054111,"id":"a597cp9k","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123066958,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)14:22:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123066181\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123066181<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;If their brain is telling them they&#039;re female, but their body is male, what&#039;s more important to listen to?<\/span><br><br>If your body is male but your brain isn&#039;t accepting that command, there&#039;s a problem somewhere along the line.

Culture and social norms don&#039;t arise out of thin air, they&#039;re expressions of biology. The norms associated with male and female gender are examples of expressed group biology. Sure you can choose to act like a girl when you&#039;re biologically male, but this doesn&#039;t change the fact that the gender part of being female arose biologically.","time":1493319816,"resto":123054111,"id":"JZ8NkzSE","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123071842,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)15:04:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123070888\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123070888<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;trips of truth <\/span><br><br>Dark days ahead, lads.","time":1493319850,"resto":123054111,"id":"875J3rXf","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123071963,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)15:05:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"One of them invented memes and one of them is a meme.

It was used for literary purposes due to the dual meaning of &quot;sex&quot; so that normies wouldn&#039;t get confused.<br><br>Then in the mid-1950s the distinction that gender = man + woman, sex = male + female was introduced. This started to become popular in the 1970s among feminism and sociology. Something to keep in mind is that during this time transgenderism was also showing up more frequently. <br><br>That&#039;s essentially what every single debate on this issue is rooted in: fucking semantics, and it&#039;s never brought up. The side that says gender is a choice, is basing their argument off of gender and sex being separate. The side that says it isn&#039;t is based on them being synonymous. <br><br>It&#039;s kind of the right and the left always arguing about equality, but no side addressing the fact the left is arguing for equality of outcome and right for equality of opportunity. When you don&#039;t get to the root argument, you&#039;re going to get nowhere because you&#039;re arguing from two different points.<br><br>It needs to be argued wether or not this distinction needs to be adopted or not. Gender being this abstract, ambiguous concept of identity overcomplicates social interaction - especially the sexual part. And if I may, I&#039;m gonna put my tin foil hat on for this one: it&#039;s a concept that might&#039;ve been introduced to encourage and normalize transgenderism - an identity based, psychological disorder.

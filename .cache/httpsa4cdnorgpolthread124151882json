The Adjustive Function.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Schools are to establish fixed habits of reaction to authority. That is their main purpose. Not learning, not spreading true knowledge; establishing fixed behaviors in the students.<\/span><br><br>2. The Conformity Function.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Schools are to make children as alike as possible- from the most gifted to the most stupid child. All are the same, despite their differences.<\/span><br><br>3. The Directive Function.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Schools are to diagnose your proper social role, and assign you said role based on the data collected about you throughout your education (grades, standardized test scores, etc). Based on this philosophy, once you&#039;re assigned a role, it is yours for life. Future people will make it incredibly difficult for you and yours to rise above the compartment you&#039;ve been assigned.<\/span>","filename":"1491284910430-2","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":576,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1493951620066,"time":1493951620,"md5":"eIaLRZCVWv4aPCBGiusFBw==","fsize":84695,"resto":0,"id":"J2Aseko6","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-six-purposes-of-schooling","country_name":"United States","replies":4,"images":4,"unique_ips":2},{"no":124152189,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)22:36:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124151882\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124151882<\/a><br><br>4. The Differentiating Function.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;This function is based off of the last one. Once students are designated to their role, wherever it may be on the hierarchy, you want to prevent the individual from learning what the &quot;higher&quot; roles above them are learning. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Because A) based on this philosophy, there is no point in learning about anything that doesn&#039;t pertain to our station in life.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;And B) Allowing the lower layers of the social order to be exposed to the higher layers of the social order&#039;s knowledge\/expertise would equalize the layers, in terms of information, and make it far easier for an individual from the &quot;lower&quot; layer to rise high.<\/span><br><br>5. The Selective Function.<br><br>- Or, simply, Darwinian Natural Selection. The structure of school is to assess the breeding quality of each individual child. The idea is to &quot;consciously improve the breeding stock.&quot; Teachers do this unknowingly, however; it&#039;s a structural harvest of information. What curators of this philosophy are looking for, to simplify things, are ways to prevent the &quot;poorer&quot; population, or the &quot;lower&quot; layers, from reproducing. They do this by encouraging shallow thought, humiliating students by labeling and dividing them, by teaching that sexual pleasure is the only valuable thing one can draw from a relationship, by trivializing spirituality and the unknown, and that short-term emotional gratification is liberating. Essentially, the principle of this function is that school acts as a mechanism for tagging the &quot;unfit&quot; by assigning them poor grades, remedial placement, etc., thus quantifying their inferiority, so that their peers will accept them as inferior, and the &quot;superior breeding stock&quot; among the opposite sex will reject whichever individual has failed this system of education.","filename":"1461040122296-2","ext":".jpg","w":1750,"h":1724,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":123,"tim":1493951793277,"time":1493951793,"md5":"cJz+7ZOx88xQ8Hx\/CGZC\/Q==","fsize":1153127,"resto":124151882,"id":"J2Aseko6","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":124152556,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)22:39:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124152189\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124152189<\/a><br><br>6.

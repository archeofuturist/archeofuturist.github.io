It&#039;s sloppy and intellectually dishonest to suggest that Marxism is in the same basket as postmodernism when it&#039;s a structuralist, materialist and humanist philosophy, whereas Foucault, Derrida and all those French idiots spent a lot of their time challenging Marx (Foucault said that Marx was irrelevant outside of the 19th century). It&#039;s very lazy to bracket Marx in with postmodern and poststructural thinkers. Also, Adam Smith approved of regulated capitalism, and most of Marx&#039;s critique of capitalism is predicated on the basis of economic rules established by classical economists like David Ricardo and Smith. Jordan Peterson is right to suggest that postmodernism is the dangerously irrational orthodoxy that dominates modern campuses.","time":1491035083,"resto":119147156,"id":"lG7NzAbj","country":"NZ","country_name":"New Zealand"},{"no":119160053,"now":"04\/01\/17(Sat)04:27:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119159906\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119159906<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Marx is regularly derided for being a &quot;white male&quot;<\/span><br>That&#039;s antisemitism which you really should point out.","time":1491035239,"resto":119147156,"id":"6gqkGB1\/","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":119160516,"now":"04\/01\/17(Sat)04:35:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119160053\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119160053<\/a><br>While anti-semitism isn&#039;t socially acceptable, my campus is a global hotspot for Palestinian activism.

I love Trump and fully support his administration, but that doesn&#039;t mean that I won&#039;t hold his feet to the fire if he starts going down the wrong path. After all, he&#039;s the best we have but still a civic nationalist at best. If he betrays us, I&#039;m not going to blindly cuck. With that said, I also hope that this Whitehouse Civil War crap is just the fake news latching onto something to try to (((divide and conquer))) the administration now that their Russian narrative is dying and the Obongo spying one is building.","time":1491461986,"resto":119715358,"id":"6h8ForIP","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119716452,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)03:00:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/BreakingNLive\/s<wbr>tatus\/849879009278255104<br>https:\/\/twitter.com\/BreakingNLive\/s<wbr>tatus\/849879009278255104<br><br>HAPPENING","time":1491462002,"resto":119715358,"id":"r3CyA3Xt","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":119716494,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)03:00:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119716452\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119716452<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;doesn&#039;t archive everything he sees<\/span><br>nigger","filename":"1484177179526","ext":".jpg","w":1394,"h":1007,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":90,"tim":1491462042383,"time":1491462042,"md5":"6EyrJp5J2Ok+jMj4D+lgSw==","fsize":139328,"resto":119715358,"id":"mnMSeXl0","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":119716497,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)03:00:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119716413\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119716413<\/a><br>Didn&#039;t Roger Stone say Kushner has regular chats with Joe is Joe?

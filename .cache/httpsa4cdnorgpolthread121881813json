But here we have someone who, when reminded of the existence of the Byzantines, actually said this wasn&#039;t a period of &quot;greatness.&quot; Holy shit.<br><br>I think one of the best arguments against the idea modern Greeks are really that different from the ancient ones is that there&#039;s so many islands in Greece, many of them inhabited and largely isolated for millenia, yet they all look pretty much the same appearance wise. There&#039;s no island in Greece where the people resemble Swedes or northern Europeans. It&#039;s incredibly unlikely that Turks, slaves etc. would have affected Greece so uniformly, down to every last isolated island.","time":1492638069,"resto":121881813,"id":"4ieENBiZ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121901215,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)17:41:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121892929\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121892929<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;we wuz greeks n shit<\/span><br>Nord niggers ruined the Mediterranean, yet want to claim it&#039;s history.","time":1492638095,"resto":121881813,"id":"hlRTJFo+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121901388,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)17:42:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121900708\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121900708<\/a><br>The guys that got one inch away from destroying the roman empire boi","time":1492638160,"resto":121881813,"id":"+S6Jvv6Y","country":"TN","country_name":"Tunisia"},{"no":121901551,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)17:43:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121899815\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121899815<\/a><br>What is pic related then, the blacked.com form 3500 years ago?","filename":"minoica_12","ext":".jpg","w":468,"h":287,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":76,"tim":1492638221605,"time":1492638221,"md5":"gDD8337iyR9yLXy7qCpq4w==","fsize":100117,"resto":121881813,"id":"3XygDQLn","country":"IT","country_name":"Italy"},{"no":121901668,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)17:44:33","name":"FUCK TRUMP","com":"<a href=\"#p121901129\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121901129<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;If they were his ancestors, that would mean they got to Rome, build it, then, once more germanic people came and made the Empire fall, left again and <\/span><br>Or just on the fact that due to population booms anyone who was alive in 1000AD is your ancestor. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;pic related is your brain<\/span>","filename":"tiny","ext":".jpg","w":320,"h":240,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1492638273145,"time":1492638273,"md5":"cTGeDojJECEiG2haczqIBA==","fsize":22471,"resto":121881813,"id":"W+H+u4mk","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121901724,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)17:44:57","name":"FUCK TRUMP","com":"<a href=\"#p121901215\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121901215<\/a><br>Nords were Meds","time":1492638297,"resto":121881813,"id":"W+H+u4mk","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121901778,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)17:45:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"India confirmed kangz","time":1492638316,"resto":121881813,"id":"CCAzO\/Kw","country":"IN","country_name":"India"},{"no":121901901,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)17:46:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121900116\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121900116<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The Ancient Greek philosophers and scientists were Nordic, and nothing like your average mongrel \u2018wog\u2019 in Greece or Italy today.<\/span><br><br>kek, how delusional","time":1492638373,"resto":121881813,"id":"hlRTJFo+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121902083,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)17:47:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121901129\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121901129<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121901901\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121901901<\/a>","filename":"1457984069297","ext":".jpg","w":1920,"h":1044,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":67,"tim":1492638446942,"time":1492638446,"md5":"+KwXEXk5kzOvCxM6eOpOiw==","fsize":350189,"resto":121881813,"id":"NQMMfs0i","country":"IT","m_img":1,"country_name":"Italy"},{"no":121902178,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)17:48:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121901724\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121901724<\/a><br>WE WUZ MEDITERRANEANS N SHIET","time":1492638491,"resto":121881813,"id":"hlRTJFo+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121902200,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)17:48:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"ITT: buttblasted non-countries that weren&#039;t invited","time":1492638499,"resto":121881813,"id":"8hyMPMcP","country":"GR","country_name":"Greece"},{"no":121902227,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)17:48:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121901668\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121901668<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;due to population booms anyone who was alive in 1000AD is your ancestor.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;more bullshit thrown in this thread<\/span><br>I&#039;m laffin even more","filename":"1492032120013","ext":".png","w":327,"h":324,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":123,"tim":1492638511112,"time":1492638511,"md5":"Z3ER8\/xOdLei9fjk5bAV9A==","fsize":104309,"resto":121881813,"id":"3XygDQLn","country":"IT","country_name":"Italy"},{"no":121902233,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)17:48:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121901901\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121901901<\/a><br>It&#039;s true.

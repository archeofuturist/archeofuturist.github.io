The astronomical odds of our solar system being the only one with life is slim to none. The milky way galaxy is estimated to have 100 billion stars, each one with the potential to harbor planets and in turn, life. We&#039;ve also estimated that there are 10 trillion galaxies. That&#039;s 100 billion stars times 10 trillion galaxies, and if we have life on 2 of those planets in 1 solar system, that&#039;s the potential for more extra terrestrial life than we could imagine.","time":1491922506,"resto":120566514,"id":"GuN9WfU9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120606674,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)10:55:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120566514\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120566514<\/a><br>Defund NASA.

Earth&#039;s atmosphere and magnetic field will make it harder to receive anything from so far away so finding undeniable evidence of extraterrestrial life will lead to more rocket launches to the high orbit (or far enough to escape Earth&#039;s gravity) and that in itself will already advance our understanding of space flight.<br><br>I&#039;m not thinking of world-wide riots because suddenly every goy wants to become a space-rapefugees but more on the lines of speeding up our progress into space. We (humans) are already sending shit around the solar system and multiple nations already have plans for putting humans on Mars. Finding alien life will get the public thinking about aliens and that will likely lead to more people taking interest in our current space projects.<br><br>tldr: My opinion changed only a little","time":1491928153,"resto":120566514,"id":"1cMiF\/Ws","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"}]}

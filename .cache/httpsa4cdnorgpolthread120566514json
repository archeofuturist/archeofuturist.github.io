The astronomical odds of our solar system being the only one with life is slim to none. The milky way galaxy is estimated to have 100 billion stars, each one with the potential to harbor planets and in turn, life. We&#039;ve also estimated that there are 10 trillion galaxies. That&#039;s 100 billion stars times 10 trillion galaxies, and if we have life on 2 of those planets in 1 solar system, that&#039;s the potential for more extra terrestrial life than we could imagine.","time":1491922506,"resto":120566514,"id":"GuN9WfU9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120606674,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)10:55:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120566514\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120566514<\/a><br>Defund NASA.

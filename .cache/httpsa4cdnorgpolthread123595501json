Their lack of funding is just as frustrating as many other things but i read some years (?) ago that they got a prototype of the precooler working, so i assumed that the project was still (slowly) advancing. The thing hardly ever was a finished design, just an idea with much of the (engine) technology little more but dreams.<br><br>But that and other exotic things are a different topic. The technological basics of what it takes to lift a decent payload to orbit and reuse the boosters\/first stage are established since decades. I mean the only real advancement we&#039;ve made in engine tech in the past half century is now coming up with Methane\/LOX full flow staged combustion engines and probably easier manufacturing of components like the laval nozzle like spacex is doing it for their merlin engines.","filename":"RD-170","ext":".jpg","w":1105,"h":1469,"tn_w":94,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493639081931,"time":1493639081,"md5":"hXK8zUfPWej3lwgfP64Qlg==","fsize":261745,"resto":123595501,"id":"BwdHM09v","country":"DE","m_img":1,"country_name":"Germany"}]}

Obviously, this is a problem. There are limits to tolerance\u201d, he told French news channel LCI in September.<br><br><br>The same month, on the first day back to school, he said in a tweet that his town was witnessing \u201cthe great replacement\u201d, referring to a conspiracy theory which claims the country\u2019s whiteChristian population is being decimated bythe growing number of foreign-born Muslims.<br><br>Menard, a long-time ally of France\u2019s anti-immigrant National Front party, denied his comments were discriminatory, saying \u201cI just described the situation in my town.\u201d<br><br>\u201cIt is not a value judgement, it\u2019s a fact. It\u2019s what I can see.\u201d he told Agence France Press at the time.<br><br>The prosecutor said that Menard had reduced children \u201cto their religion, regardless of whether they have French nationality or do not practice.\u201d He convicted the far-right official of \u201cincitement to hatred and discrimination\u201d and awarded\u20ac1,000 to seven the anti-racist groups that brought the matter to court.<br><br>Menard\u2019s lawyer claimed the contest was a matter or free speech and called on the court not to pronounce \u201ca death penalty of the freedom to think\u201d.<br><br>Menard himself said: \u201cIf the truth, what we see, becomes an offense, we can never say anything again. I have described a situation, I have said what all the elected officials find and never dare to say. To leave them like that is to condemn them. That\u2019s why I\u2019m trying to solve this problem.\u201d","filename":"Screenshot_2017-05-03-02-34-11_1","ext":".jpg","w":1076,"h":613,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":142,"tim":1493753983446,"time":1493753983,"md5":"blav5IOfQ0okzXg0ZIFBoQ==","fsize":95060,"resto":0,"id":"nkASh5sz","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"marine-le-pen-advisor-fined-for-saying-there-are","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":2,"unique_ips":1},{"no":123808735,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)15:41:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"Menard caused outrage on social media in October for plasteringhis town with posters warning against the arrival of migrants in Beziers that he says the state is \u201cimposing on us.\u201d","filename":"57ff5b17c4618864388b4585","ext":".jpg","w":900,"h":500,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":69,"tim":1493754065339,"time":1493754065,"md5":"SrChiwzQI4toJ+1WebM+cA==","fsize":95483,"resto":123808573,"id":"nkASh5sz","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123809159,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)15:44:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"What happened to the French I know? which almost defeated Russia. <br><br>now just submited their country to Islam.. anyway if french fall, muslim will get 1 nuke in France","filename":"russia2012x192","ext":".jpg","w":414,"h":423,"tn_w":122,"tn_h":124,"tim":1493754281841,"time":1493754281,"md5":"zLuusJflKqA0dAwOYioaIA==","fsize":33034,"resto":123808573,"id":"nkASh5sz","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

I won&#039;t make any value judgments on the Syria Strikes. It&#039;s obvious that they&#039;re a major point of contention, but I won&#039;t wade into that swamp.<br><br>What&#039;s important is that because of this event, and because of the dubious nature of what happened Pre-Strike, shills are taking a huge opportunity to slide this board because they know it&#039;s the last good chance they get before definitive action is taken in Syria. They want to break the board before President Trump decides what he wants to do, and therefore breaking his largest stronghold of support on the Internet.<br><br>What&#039;s also important is that if this board slide fails, \/pol\/ only becomes stronger. Shareblue and various slimy discords are throwing the entire kitchen sink at us. What you must know is that you cannot fail in repudiating their useless threads and constant shilling. Remember, these people get paid to show up and do for work what you do for free everyday. They are more pathetic and useless than even the worst animeposter.<br><br>This is their last best effort. Shove them off the board and don&#039;t let them have an inch. And remember, everyday Clinton isn&#039;t in the White House, or the Democrats can&#039;t filibuster, is a win for us. Based Gorsuch just got on the SCOTUS, for example. That&#039;s a thirty year legacy right there. The very idea of America First and Fortress America scares the shit out of them and they are ready to go to literal war to try and end it.<br><br>Just remember all the shit that happens in Europe everyday, and remind yourself that people want to bring that to the States in record numbers. Seek out the sources of these sliding efforts and find out what you can. Then remove kebap.<br><br>God Speed, \/pol\/. Don&#039;t let them crush your spirit.","filename":"kebab removal service how can we remove","ext":".png","w":368,"h":368,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491705785360,"time":1491705785,"md5":"FjB55qN2rmWXSP+XzH8UPg==","fsize":124172,"resto":0,"id":"EgZ4EN90","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"this-is-their-last-best-effort","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

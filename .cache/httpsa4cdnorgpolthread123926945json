Remember when I talked about actual goings on in the world and politics? And when I wanted to start streaming my own talk show? Now all I can seem to do is dedicate at least two of my videos EVERY SINGLE DAY to muh legacy media\u2122. Seriously help I can&#039;t stop stroking my own ego claiming I am the new media, even though all I do is read a story and give my opinion on it. When the legacy media\u2122 fails I will either have to leave my moms house to do actual reporting or go broke.<br><br>That&#039;s about all peace out.","filename":"images (1)","ext":".jpg","w":278,"h":182,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":163,"tim":1493827418564,"time":1493827418,"md5":"lVTsvwt377UlT64W5IBZ8A==","fsize":16711,"resto":0,"id":"vDnpjGkB","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"muh-legacy-media","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":1,"unique_ips":2},{"no":123927516,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)12:09:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123926945\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123926945<\/a><br>10.2","filename":"1492044812125","ext":".jpg","w":1836,"h":1416,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":96,"tim":1493827755254,"time":1493827755,"md5":"+8gwe9VXV52aAFNVwjfnqw==","fsize":568547,"resto":123926945,"id":"c3YlLhH1","country":"GB","m_img":1,"country_name":"United Kingdom"}]}

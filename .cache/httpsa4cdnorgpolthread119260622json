Explicit support of &quot;Womens&#039; Rights&quot;, whatever the fuck that is.<br><br>Basically, modern &quot;liberalism&quot; aligns with the contemporary trend of postmodern destruction of any meaning at all. Sure, I get it, if you break anything down far enough, everything we do seems absurd. Surface level exploration of this kind of thought makes people feel special. They think they&#039;re outside thinkers, separate from &quot;the masses&quot; who mindlessly consume. It&#039;s an intellectual elitism that lacks any nuance or real insight. It&#039;s all about making everyone feel a certain way, even if we have to openly deny reality to achieve that, because it is for the greater good. <br><br>I hold largely &quot;liberal&quot; opinions on most topics, but the past two years I have had my biggest fears confirmed. There always felt like there was nothing behind liberal points, or that the logical conclusion of liberal thought lead to something weird and unproductive for society. The hard line dedication to idealism is beyond unproductive, it is counter productive and drives people to the other side. But back to the topic at hand. The problem is that women generally never reach the point where they realize certain truths of reality.<br><br>Good does not equal &quot;not bad&quot;<br>Bad does not equal &quot;not good&quot;<br>neither of those concepts really exists,<br>BUT, there are things that will positively or negatively effect the reality of one person or another....<br><br>...and going from there to a point of real critical thought that challenges our personal notions of good and bad. To most women and liberal people, there is a defined good and evil. This dogmatic thought pattern is the same as the religious people they claim to hate.","time":1491195806,"resto":119260622,"id":"AcQ0xenQ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119293322,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)01:04:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"(2\/2)<br>Without rambling further: There needs to be a balance.

Anyway, I continued the massage over on the grass where I had her rest down on her stomach, soothingly feeling her everywhere from the neck all the way down to the ankles (even getting my hands all over her rear-end and explaining that this area is full of what are called the sciatic-nerves), and whilst telling her to relax she was commenting about how it&#039;s hard for her to relax when some guy is touching her all over her butt (hint: this means that it&#039;s causing her to feel sexually excited even though I did not pick up on that or interpret it that way at the time due to my lack-of-experience with women back then),","time":1491510373,"resto":119784851,"id":"9GD45pyx","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119789378,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)16:26:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119784851\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119784851<\/a><br><br>well, he does have better domestic policies than shitllary","time":1491510394,"resto":119784851,"id":"kq1rAEMw","country":"RO","country_name":"Romania"},{"no":119789389,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)16:26:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119789339\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119789339<\/a><br> then I continued the massage all the way down to her feet, had her turn over onto her back, working my way back up her body from the front of her feet until arriving around the abdomen-area.<br><br>This is where I wanted to do IRL what I had always done in on-line multi-player RPGs for seducing the ladies which was proceed to cup my hands around the girl&#039;s breasts &amp; fondle them whilst disguising it as a massage (and when you ever get a chance to do this make sure you put your thumbs on her tits &amp; rub around in circular-motions briskly).

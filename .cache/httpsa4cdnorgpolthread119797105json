They have been the basis of it and they have been, ultimately, the sole purpose of everything. The plants, here, blooming around us in immensity and glory, everywhere! In the deserts, the arctic, with sand sheer upon the ground, with great flows of blue ice. They&#039;re everywhere, circling and going under the ground like veins, veins of pure beauty and being. Look around you here, we&#039;re surrounded by them and inundated by these beautiful green forms of life. To the left and to the right and to the north and to the south, to the east and to the west. But there are also insects. Have you ever read Maurice Maeterlinck&#039;s Life of the Bee? It&#039;s a glorious book. A book about the nature of the hive; the great architecture of these beings beyond death that represent an exoskeleton of life that contains no life in human form because they are reduced essentially to the matter of function. Insects. They are function. They have no false concept of individuality, they serve the whole, which is them - spiritually. Each insect is a part of a greater whole, they have one soul, headed in this case by the queen, superintended upon by slaves who nurture her in the nectar of their own milk - the egalitarian mass of people. The more I looked at these insects, the more I saw them, the more I looked at them through a magnifying glass, I wanted...I wanted to destroy them! I had a decision to make. And even as I looked at them through the magnifying glass I had the belief that I could refract the sun down, through the glass, unto them so as to destroy what was there. And it was when I looked at evolution that I came to the decision upon which my entire life has been based hitherto; that&#039;s too destructive, keep the insects to harvest the plants.<\/span>","filename":"1489947964834","ext":".jpg","w":601,"h":459,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":95,"tim":1491514441976,"time":1491514441,"md5":"d3b9IrYpgkXBv6PWYhDg+g==","fsize":55116,"resto":119797105,"id":"tzZ5THTM","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119798632,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)17:34:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119797971\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119797971<\/a><br>You mean like two weeks ago when we had to hold your hand and explain you step by step why Trump won and Bernie is shit candidate?

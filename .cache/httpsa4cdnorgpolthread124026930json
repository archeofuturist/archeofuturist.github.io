Wars of aggression, even in the name of liberation, will never be supported by the party. Alliances will not be taken lightly thus, meaning some current agreements may require reconsideration in regards to the risk and reward factor that it poses the state. The state will also resist the attempts of any foreign power, ally or not, to influence the internal politics or society of the nation. Continued attempts at the influence of the nation from a foreign power will eventually lead to economic sanctions or potentially the severing of diplomatic ties until operations cease and an official apology is issued. Due to the isolationist stance, an overwhelming military like that of the current United States will not be necessary, though the nation will never disarm or leave itself weak in contrast to neighbors or other powerful spheres of influence. With the modest military format, the draft will always be opposed by the national libertarian party on the basis of individual liberty unless there are enemy forces amassing on our sovereign soil.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Anti-Immigration<\/span><br>The national libertarian party will support closing the borders of the state to immigration save for those explicitly skilled in positions deemed empty and unfillable by nationals. When immigration is opened up, cultural brethren will be given priority. If there is a decrease in population due to low birthrates in the nation, this will not be treated with hordes of foreign migrants but rather state incentives to national-born citizenry to reproduce and bear more children. All illegal immigrants, or foreign invaders, will be routed out and removed. Refuge status will only be granted temporarily to those fleeing personal political persecution under the party&#039;s protection of whistleblowers whether at home or abroad.","filename":"Oxen","ext":".jpg","w":900,"h":814,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":226,"tim":1493877247591,"time":1493877247,"md5":"\/l26rwhSj\/QxL\/aIYQECcQ==","fsize":128389,"resto":0,"id":"O0UPrSo4","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"national-libertarianism-a-balance-between-the","country_name":"United States","replies":4,"images":0,"unique_ips":1},{"no":124026966,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)01:54:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Free Speech<\/span><br>The national libertarian party will never support any form of limitations on speech in their nation, whether political, religious or otherwise. Thus, &#039;hate speech&#039; will be tolerated under law given that the speech does not escalate to violent action towards nationals or citizenry upon foreign soil. Hate speech resulting in violent action will be treated the same as any other form of terrorism, with detainment or death if necessary. Terrorists will find no quarter under national libertarian rule.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Gun Rights<\/span><br>The national libertarian party will never support any form of limitations on the right of its citizenry to bear arms unless previously convicted of a violent gun-related crime. The right to protect one\u2019s self, family and property as well as to fend of tyranny is the right of all.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Regulated Abortion<\/span><br>The national libertarian party will support enforcing and maintaining reasonable regulations upon abortion, while not outright banning the procedure. The maximum time from the point of impregnation to undergo an abortion will be a firm twelve weeks with no flexibility. Before an abortion may be undergone, the expecting mother must undergo a three day waiting period and be given literature discussing alternatives such as state-sponsored and fund-incentivized adoption.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Basic Human Respect<\/span><br>The national libertarian party will fight to ensure that all are equal under the eyes of the law, regardless of faith, race, creed, sex or personal identification. Any and all attempts to violate the rights of one group that another still has will be opposed by the party. In regards to homosexual and transsexual marriage, the national libertarian party will simply support civil unions for all personal relationships recognized by the state as opposed to the government having any hand in holy matrimony.","time":1493877271,"resto":124026930,"id":"O0UPrSo4","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124027070,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)01:55:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Flat Taxation<\/span><br>The national libertarian party will never support a progressive tax and in its stead endorse a flat tax rate that will be the same across all economic classes.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Free Trade<\/span><br>The national libertarian party will oppose most government regulation in business affairs and trade that does not pertain to maintaining the environmental health of the nation or the medical health of nationals.

Contracts between the employer and the employee will be made between them without government intervention. The state should only intervene to enforce the contracts, not to regulate them. Basic workers privileges such as a minimum wage, regulated hours as well as paid overtime will be the few regulation placed on the relationship between the employer and the employee. Interactions between buyer and seller will be treated, within reason, the same. The party will oppose anyone being forced to provide a product that they do not wish to provide to those that they do not believe it within their morals or interests to provide it to.","time":1493877340,"resto":124026930,"id":"O0UPrSo4","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124027109,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)01:56:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Anti-Corporatism<\/span><br>The national libertarian party will refuse to give out corporate welfare to any business except for in the case of encouraging technological research and development such as in the areas of energy, exploration and military equipment.

The corporate taxation of any given business will increase exponentially once they have conquered over 50% of the market share of their product or service as to promote fair competition and to refuse monopolies the opportunity to abuse their position.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;States\u2019 Rights<\/span><br>The national libertarian party will, when there is no official party stance available, generally support the right of states, regions, provinces, territories or kingdoms to provide the answer to legal and ethical questions such as the death penalty as well as some economic as opposed to federal enforcement when unnecessary.

Just as natural bio-diversity will be protected under environmental regulations, so will the bio-diversity of humans be protected, primarily that of the traditional native population of the state. All peoples will find themselves respected under the law, though the preservation of the native population will become first priority when it becomes necessary.

A separation of religion and state will be guarded over by the party with respect to religious liberty and religion itself as to not fall into state atheism. Religious organizations should be offered tax exempt status unless they begin to act in ways that violate the separation of religion and state, where their exempt status may be revoked should they directly begin to manipulate the state.<br><br>------","time":1493877395,"resto":124026930,"id":"O0UPrSo4","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

By far history is male dominated thus most inventions were made by men, and when I say most I estimate over 90%. Even saying women have made 10% of inventions is generous, their relevance in society throughout history has only ever been as a way to create more humans. Most psychopaths are incredibly smart, almost all sociopaths and psychopaths are men, both illnesses create people with incredible intelligence, manipulation etc. Men are built for competition Women are not, if Men are to be the hunters they do not only require the physical superiority but the mental capability. Much more so than a woman taking care of the village\/children. Hunting, trading, governance etc. Nearly every role in society has been male dominated for thousands of years thus you would expect Men to be more competent for these roles than Women who have little historical prevalence in these areas.

Look at any Jewtube feminist and how much money they make. It ties with victimhood and gibs.<br><br>Women may think they can build, but they will never, ever try. Not on their own. Not with any amount of work comparable to men. Evolution proved that isn&#039;t their place. Hiding this, they go with the women&#039;s way: shame and sex. One, the other, or both at once. If you don&#039;t care, they have zero power. So they&#039;ll make others shame you too until you submit. Only in society are women capable of power because the hard work was already done.","time":1493364057,"resto":123154289,"id":"rrPAc6Ak","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123164234,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)03:21:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123163352\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123163352<\/a><br>The first computer was invented by a man Charles Babbage.

At the head of races, above the elite, there is Monarchy. Not all monarchs have been good. Monarchy, however, has always been good. The individual monarch must not be confused with the institution of Monarchy, the conclusions drawn from this would be false. There can be bad priests, but this does not mean that we can draw the conclusion that the Church must be ended and God stoned to death. There are certainly weak or bad monarchs, but we cannot renounce Monarchy. The race has a line of life. A monarch is great and good, when he stays on this line ; he is petty and bad, to the extent that he moves away from this racial line of life or he opposes it. There are many lines by which a monarch can be tempted. He must set them all aside and follow the line of the race. Here is the law of Monarchy.<\/span>","filename":"codreanu2","ext":".png","w":1378,"h":568,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":51,"tim":1490489952460,"time":1490489952,"md5":"VngvJflMGkN9laVMVsgzQw==","fsize":823600,"resto":118298227,"id":"MBiLEp9D","country":"GB","m_img":1,"country_name":"United Kingdom"}]}

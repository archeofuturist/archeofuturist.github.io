They are naive, idealistic, their approach is &quot;let&#039;s be friends with everybody&quot;. It&#039;s a feminine, submissive attitude, born from evolutionary physical disadvantage compared to grown males, who don&#039;t necessarily have to bow down to anyone, but are able to challenge others. Women and children share this weakness, and they love nothing more than (made-up) stories that confirm their view of the world, that there will be a happy end.<br>They love children&#039;s books because it doesn&#039;t end with the protagonist&#039;s family getting slaughtered by the poor oppressed people they took in and cared for, there is no culture clash, no end in suffering and pain when the whole previous world falls apart. <br>They already live in a dream world, and in modern feminized society, nobody wakes them up.","filename":"1470699112776","ext":".jpg","w":434,"h":987,"tn_w":54,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492887435561,"time":1492887435,"md5":"b0PKvGj4FDovfecGZn5dug==","fsize":150861,"resto":122286161,"id":"gLQgbWOg","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":122312325,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)14:58:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122310220\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122310220<\/a><br>I would put all my sesemen up their streets","time":1492887513,"resto":122286161,"id":"1jcK9OJh","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":122312329,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)14:58:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122286161\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122286161<\/a><br>Making references to literature is generally seen as a sign of intellect and education.<br><br>They never read anything else though so that&#039;s the only one they can refer to.","time":1492887515,"resto":122286161,"id":"itaT9bj9","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":122312524,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)15:00:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122286161\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122286161<\/a><br>What&#039;s wrong with the Potty?","filename":"HarrySS","ext":".jpg","w":686,"h":734,"tn_w":116,"tn_h":124,"tim":1492887622645,"time":1492887622,"md5":"Qu34uxpHPfwEWohMKo3Rwg==","fsize":80394,"resto":122286161,"id":"Rruf8OZH","country":"DK","country_name":"Denmark"},{"no":122312525,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)15:00:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122312325\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122312325<\/a><br>Most Muppets like a good fisting","filename":"sexy-sesame-street-halloween-costumes-1","ext":".jpg","w":576,"h":440,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":95,"tim":1492887623458,"time":1492887623,"md5":"jxiy2zMCRjxEMdDCunHkbw==","fsize":73940,"resto":122286161,"id":"\/sVu7tjl","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122313124,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)15:05:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122312525\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122312525<\/a><br>Imma make them deepthroat \u00e6lmo dick<br><br>... ufff longshot","time":1492887934,"resto":122286161,"id":"1jcK9OJh","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":122314127,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)15:13:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122313124\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122313124<\/a><br>stop","time":1492888432,"resto":122286161,"id":"Dkeg5tcS","country":"AT","country_name":"Austria"},{"no":122314252,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)15:14:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122305909\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122305909<\/a><br>There&#039;s absolutely no political message in Harry Potter, the books or the movies, at least beyond &quot;the evil snake man wants to take over the world&quot;. <br>It&#039;s completely safe for kids to read and watch, JK Rowling has just gone on a leftist tirade recently and is using her popularity to influence people. <br>Of course she isn&#039;t writing anything new that reflects her newfound political views, she&#039;s just bandwaggoning and twisting her existing work and implying it has messages that it doesn&#039;t. <br>It&#039;s your bog standard good vs irredeemable evil, and there are no political overtones. <br>In fact last time I read it I found the lack of political messages refreshing, they&#039;re being shoved down our throats so much in these trying times.","time":1492888488,"resto":122286161,"id":"CvsksRnD","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":122314825,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)15:19:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122286959\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122286959<\/a><br>this image is clearly doctored, trump has never worn a suit that fit him","time":1492888762,"resto":122286161,"id":"2HEzFLPk","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122315650,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)15:26:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122314252\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122314252<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Recently<\/span><br><br>She&#039;s always been super-lefty and there&#039;s a ton of stuff in the books that isn&#039;t evident unless you know British society;

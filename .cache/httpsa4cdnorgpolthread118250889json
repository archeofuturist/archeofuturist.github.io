This is somewhat obscured by the fact that workers were still paid ruble wages, and that money continued in use as a unit of account in the planned industries, but the social content of these \u2018monetary forms\u2019 changed drastically. Under Soviet planning, the division between the necessary and surplus portions of the social product was the result of political decisions. <br><br>For the most part, goods and labour were physically allocated to enterprises by the planning authorities, who would always ensure that the enterprises had enough money to \u2018pay for\u2019 the real goods allocated to them. If an enterprise made monetary \u2018losses\u2019, and therefore had to have its money balances topped up with \u2018subsidies\u2019, that was no matter. On the other hand, possession of money as such was no guarantee of being able to get hold of real goods. By the same token, the resources going into production of consumer goods were centrally allocated. Suppose the workers won higher ruble wages: by itself this would achieve nothing, since the flow of production of consumer goods was not<br>responsive to the monetary amount of consumer spending.

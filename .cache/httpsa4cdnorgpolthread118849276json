Obama signed an executive order banning LGBT discrimination among federal contractors; he concurrently signed an order requiring contracted businesses prove they&#039;re complying with federal laws and executive orders. President Trump rescinded the latter order, making it much more difficult to know whether a business has committed to ending LGBT bias in hiring, firing, and promotions.","filename":"rainbowpepe2","ext":".jpg","w":737,"h":696,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":236,"tim":1490829549099,"time":1490829549,"md5":"fKnSYQNM3wqQCyGuas3V0A==","fsize":125425,"resto":0,"id":"\/kx2CBm9","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"trump-suspends-lgbt-protections-for-federal","country_name":"United States","replies":37,"images":6,"unique_ips":25},{"no":118849756,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)19:23:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118849276\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118849276<\/a><br>aNOTHER BROKEN PROMISE FROM THE ORANGE FUCK FACE IN CHIEF","filename":"1490730453436","ext":".jpg","w":1440,"h":1440,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490829835772,"time":1490829835,"md5":"egfznQ8HHTqbycZmfCsDHg==","fsize":144960,"resto":118849276,"id":"NWL\/VOGU","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":118849863,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)19:24:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;trump repeals unneeded regulation<\/span><br><br>#wow #whoa","time":1490829895,"resto":118849276,"id":"NUplw6JS","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118849915,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)19:25:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118849276\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118849276<\/a><br>GOOD why should homos be a protected class?<br>No one should be forced to hire a fag if they don&#039;t want to.","time":1490829925,"resto":118849276,"id":"fYZ1aVA3","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118850027,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)19:26:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118849915\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118849915<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;GOOD why should homos be a protected class?<\/span><br><br>Why should Christians be one?","filename":"1490758316904","ext":".jpg","w":300,"h":348,"tn_w":107,"tn_h":124,"tim":1490829984939,"time":1490829984,"md5":"RlIIuSMyL5i+cRBcA2TJCw==","fsize":30786,"resto":118849276,"id":"NWL\/VOGU","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118850140,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)19:27:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118850027\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118850027<\/a><br>Being a fag is disgusting, I&#039;m glad we can discriminate against them again.","time":1490830047,"resto":118849276,"id":"fYZ1aVA3","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118850160,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)19:27:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118849276\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118849276<\/a><br>Good.

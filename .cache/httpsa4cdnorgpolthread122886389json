There isn&#039;t enough information in the article to tell if they are actually doing the same exact job. Given demographic trends in the kind of jobs women tend to go for, the current political climate, and how close the cited 71 cents is to the much repeated &quot;women make 79 cents for every dollar men make&quot; myth which has been repeated debunked I think it&#039;s safe to say this is sensationalism capitalizing on a hot issue to serve ulterior motives.

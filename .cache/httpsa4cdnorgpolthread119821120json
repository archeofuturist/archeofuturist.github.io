THERE IS NO PLAN FOR THE FUTURE hence why there are no jobs but &quot;refugees&quot; are top of the agenda. <br><br>So what are you going to do about it \/pol\/ - are you going to sit here or are we ready to rally against the government? <br><br>Just like Occupy, some of you will die, regardless of whether we merely march for a constitutional convention or we decide to go for violence. You better come with the knowledge that you might not go home. We don&#039;t need any pussies showing up at our rally.","filename":"laughingman","ext":".png","w":900,"h":506,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1491524062750,"time":1491524062,"md5":"QwVA48cXNTSvBrBm4NERww==","fsize":609647,"resto":0,"id":"das4Y7Zj","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"is-it-time-for-a-civil-war","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

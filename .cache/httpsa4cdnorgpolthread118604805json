I was an instructor here my first year and was discriminated against by the Farsi\/Persian chair person B side. After wrongfully resigning, I personally made a formal complaint against B side, stating that she had violated the federal personal prohibited practices act; this is through the office of special counsel and US Merit protection board. Both of which failed due to a high volume case load existing at these agencies and my mistake of resigning. I also made a written complaint to then congressional representative Sam Farr. Burnside decided to built a termination packet against me from day one, under the monitoring of then Dean Z Shen. I know this information because I requested my termination packet from the US Merit Protection Board. I had tried to change my chair the first day on the job, but my supervisor, team lead, and peers presuaded me from doing so. After my departure, these very peers and senior supervisors requested to be immediately transferred to another department. Funny how B side herself doesn&#039;t have a degree in the target language and is unqualified to even teach the language, little be critiquing others about their know how of the target language. Little did this FOB know that I had maxed out the FLPT in the Farsi\/Persian five times prior and that I had served some eight years in the armed forces, including a deployment to Iraq. Later I deployed as a Dari linguist to Afghanistan for a year.<br>If you feel that you have been wronged by any means by chair person Burnside or her lower staff members then you should change your department immediately and make a formal complaint to your chain of command.&quot;<br><br>Did you write that, anon?","time":1490678424,"resto":118604805,"id":"tSM\/mo+D","country":"A1","country_name":"Unknown"},{"no":118615150,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)01:20:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118614976\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118614976<\/a><br>You&#039;re fishing for information.

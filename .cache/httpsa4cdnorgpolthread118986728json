I happened to stumble on my state&#039;s Republican Senator&#039;s official page<br><br>I noticed something strange about the comments. Not only were they all negative, but they all seemed to follow a similar script. A lot of the comments on unrelated posts were admonishing him for supporting DeVos and Pruitt and giving the same values for money he supposedly took. If it was something he did that was bipartisan, the script looked like &quot;That&#039;s great, but [liberal issue I&#039;m outraged about.&quot; I know leftists like to repeat the same tired talking points they hear from their favorite dyke commentators, but this was different in the sheer amount of comments that were almost exactly the same.<br><br>It was obvious that there was more to it than people acting on their own behalf. Gardner already got in trouble for saying that the people demanding he hold town hall meetings for them to disrupt were paid protestors from out of state. He made the same statement about the flood of phone calls his office received. I did a little digging to see where these people were finding their scripts, and I came across something called &quot;Indivisible Guide.&quot;<br>https:\/\/www.indivisibleguide.com\/<br>Lo and behold, they not only had a full guide for disrupting and harassing anyone who disagreed with them, which they claim is based on Tea Party activists, but also a page dedicated to scripts for various issues&quot;","filename":"ASTROTURBERG","ext":".jpg","w":400,"h":400,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490916608533,"time":1490916608,"md5":"BPgCAERYjGMY1hbJURCfYw==","fsize":21153,"resto":0,"id":"f67uhfk5","country":"US","bumplimit":1,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"indivisible-guide-general-get-in-here","country_name":"United States","replies":330,"images":94,"unique_ips":133,"tail_size":50},{"no":118986775,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)19:30:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"LINKS:<br>http:\/\/www.indivisbleguide.com\/<br>http:\/\/dailysignal.com\/2017\/02\/10\/i<wbr>ndivisible-with-ties-to-george-soro<wbr>s-sows-division-against-trump-gop-l<wbr>awmakers\/","time":1490916631,"resto":118986728,"id":"f67uhfk5","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118986907,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)19:31:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118986728\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118986728<\/a><br>BUMP","time":1490916701,"resto":118986728,"id":"9GBP2WCq","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118987043,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)19:32:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118986728\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118986728<\/a><br><br>It&#039;s clear that this is coming from someone higher up.

These people came to many, many of our town halls and tore shit up. After a while they realized that the particular officials they were harrassing were actually pretty liberal and thus they&#039;ve slowly stopped coming to meetings. But here&#039;s a few things I&#039;ve observed.<br><br>1. They are almost exclusively Jewish. I was in charge of the sign in sheets. Probably 7 out 10 of people signing in had names like (((Greenburg))) or (((Stern))). Honestly I didn&#039;t believe the truth about (((them))) until I saw it with my own eyes at these events. \/pol\/ really is always right.<br><br>2. They are professionally run but locally organized. I saw many local leftists directing people to seats and calling people by name. But there were these shadowy, younger people doing the filming, handing out the flyers and hand signs. They would frequently meet with the locals and coordinate who would ask what questions. <br><br>3. They rehearse like crazy. At one point an angry constituent started yelling and asked &quot;how many of you are actually *elected officials* constituents?&quot; and they shouted in unison &quot;ALL OF US&quot;. It was definitely rehearsed and sounded way too in your face to be authentic.<br><br>4. Many of these guys were not from district. Local leftists were directing, but by and large the individual protesters were coming from around the state. <br><br>Anyway, I have more stories.

And it was one of them who wrote the story in the &quot;Denver Guardian&quot; that an FBI agent who leaked Clinton emails was killed. Coler says that over 10 days the site got 1.6 million views. He says stories like this work because they fit into existing right-wing conspiracy theories.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;The people wanted to hear this,&quot; he says. &quot;So all it took was to write that story. Everything about it was fictional: the town, the people, the sheriff, the FBI guy. And then ... our social media guys kind of go out and do a little dropping it throughout Trump groups and Trump forums and boy it spread like wildfire.&quot;<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;And as the stories spread, Coler makes money from the ads on his websites. He wouldn&#039;t give exact figures, but he says stories about other fake-news proprietors making between $10,000 and $30,000 a month apply to him. Coler fits into a pattern of other faux news sites that make good money, especially by targeting Trump supporters.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;However, Coler insists this is not about money. It&#039;s about showing how easily fake news spreads. And fake news spread wide and far before the election.

The guide is continuously updated and is available in English and Spanish.[1]<br><br>By February 4, 2017, less than two months from the publication of the Indivisible Guide, and barely two weeks after Trump&#039;s inauguration, more than 3,800 local groups identifying as &quot;Indivisibles&quot; had formed and declared their support for the movement.[8]<br><br>The Indivisible Guide team has indicated that they are starting a nonprofit organization to send out regular updates on happenings in Congress and to support local Indivisible movements.[1]","filename":"SOROS_CLINTON_MERKEL_TRUDEAU","ext":".jpg","w":2198,"h":1576,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":89,"tim":1490923243677,"time":1490923243,"md5":"mmlcPJ2uJxcW+DLDUot8Pw==","fsize":2270471,"resto":118986728,"id":"\/uq1ul3y","country":"CA","m_img":1,"country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118998966,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)21:20:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"I would read more but I&#039;m really tired.

Ecoweenies label it green and divert attention away from how shit they are. The US is required to have 10% corn ethanol in all our gas.<br><br>Corn ethanol is more expensive than gasoline, and costs more gas to farm, refine, and transport to the gas station than it actually makes. The stuff is a shitty fuel altogether. It absorbs water moisture too good. Only new engines were designed to handle ethanol in our gas, while old ones made when gas was still pure gasoline are being damaged.<br><br>I&#039;ve heard sugercane ethanol is way better, but we don&#039;t do it because Big Corn doesn&#039;t want us to.","time":1490534594,"resto":118340437,"id":"M58ZekET","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118360897,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)09:23:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118359789\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118359789<\/a><br>A large amount of vehicles in Brazil run on biofuel, namely ethanol.

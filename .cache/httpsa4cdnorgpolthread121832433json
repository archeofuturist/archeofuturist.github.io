Those things do neuter the aggressive pursuit of geopolitical goals. In the 90s, we were given no quarter, no helping hand, there is zero reason to trust the West now. Now watch the EU unravel in a couple of decades and the European states returning to same same old rearmament and saber rattling.","time":1492606431,"resto":121832433,"id":"JUQEj6F\/","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":121840609,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)08:54:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121840197\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121840197<\/a><br>you have a few peasant uprisings to deal with there","time":1492606444,"resto":121832433,"id":"\/nB94HKD","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":121840803,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)08:56:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121840587\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121840587<\/a><br>There are NATO military bases on every single one of your borders except for Belarus and Ukraine. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I&#039;d be scared too Ivan Ivanovich.<\/span>","time":1492606583,"resto":121832433,"id":"idBbWMXr","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":121840856,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)08:57:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121840197\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121840197<\/a><br>I shill for Russia so much that 9\/10 times I played as Muscovy only.","time":1492606624,"resto":121832433,"id":"MsP+lMOs","country":"HR","country_name":"Croatia"},{"no":121840941,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)08:58:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"Everybody who takes him seriously is genuinely retarded.","time":1492606692,"resto":121832433,"id":"K1Q+bApW","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":121840972,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)08:58:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121839992\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121839992<\/a><br><br>The nukes aren&#039;t a panacea, but the extreme measure, the last possible resort.

American politicians here get a lot of flak for thinking the Cold War never ended and being aggressive with Russia but Russia itself is not innocent of Cold War revitalism either, with this buffer zone mentality against the West. Historically they fought against Mongols who were united with Chinese, and even fought the Chinese directly in some border skirmishes, but they have no buffer zones or troop buildup near China. <br><br>They get upset over our missile shields in Poland but really the missile shield is defensive, and likely won&#039;t do anything at all if Russia decides to launch ballistic missiles. They&#039;re acting like it&#039;s the Cuban missile crisis and they make comparisons to that, but we didn&#039;t have ICBMs pointed at them off the coast of Norway. <br><br>What happens if all the missile shields are gone anyway? They&#039;ll still be autistic about buffer zones, it won&#039;t change a thing. Even if NATO fully appeases them and makes them join (pipe dream scenario) they&#039;ll still be paranoid, but that paranoia won&#039;t get them anywhere. I&#039;m not saying they have to suck the dick of the West, they can still do their own thing, but it amazes me how they think they&#039;re gonna be attacked at any given time by a bunch of EU countries.","time":1492606771,"resto":121832433,"id":"BY8VXaTY","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121841067,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)08:59:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121840803\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121840803<\/a><br>Nah, there are no NATO bases in Central Asia as far as I&#039;m aware.

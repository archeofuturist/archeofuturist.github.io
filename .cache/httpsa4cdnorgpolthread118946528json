And the Commission is accountable to the Parliament. <br><br>Every time I argue with people like you I end up saying the above, which is a fucking fact, and you will keep claiming there is some weird conspiracy behind the curtains that is manipulating all of us. We always end up here.<br><br>Even then, the UK gets a say at every part of the democratic process (Council\/Commission\/Parliament), and the people who make these processes are decided at both a domestic General Election level and the European Election level. We had full input in to the EU at all stages. Just because the UK public kept voting in ineffective MEPs who refuse to represent our interests rather than sabotaging them for political gain (cough UKIP cough) is our fault, not the EUs. This &quot;The EU is undemocratic&quot; is bullshit. We are in every discussion, it&#039;s up to the UK to either accept or disagree with it.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The UK is always outvoted by the other 27 cuck nations of the EU. There&#039;s nothing the UK can do when they are outnumbered.<\/span><br><br>No they&#039;re not, that simply isn&#039;t true. All EU member countries are tightly involved in making EU laws. No EU law can become law without every single member state agreeing to it. We veto a lot of things the EU want to pass. For example last April EU wanted to protect the UK steel industry against China and said we should add a 40% tariff to China steel imports. Guess what, the UK vetoed that. Yet the steel industry still used the EU as a scapegoat for poor domestic policy. Another example was the proposed EU law to restrict the infinite bonuses bankers pay themselves - it was backed by 27\/28 EU members.<br><br><a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/118941049#p118946524\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118946524<\/a><br><br>In 1975 Remain won with a clear majority, unlike the EU referendum which was a razor thin margin.

However, I think that &quot;disavowing&quot; him at this stage is a bit premature. The important part is shouting our displeasure at his decision from the rooftops so that he knows that he just alienated a good portion of the people who voted him in. Trump thrives on popularity, and he knows he cannot afford to ignore the very people that will (if listened to and if the contract he made with the American people is ultimately upheld) vote him in again come 2020.<br><br>I&#039;m a patient man, and am willing to see how this plays out.

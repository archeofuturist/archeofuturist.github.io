The world would looks just. Meaning there really wouldn&#039;t be crime. But people would be allowed to smoke weed. Do I want to live in a world where people come to my house....in hoodies.....with aviator glasses on.....walking around my house recording it? No, It scares the shit out of me. If you want the &quot;Honor&quot;? Because I don&#039;t feel like dying. I can find the pics that were put out....","time":1493619432,"resto":123577675,"id":"rJ03p5gT","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123587342,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)02:17:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123586970\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123586970<\/a><br>I&#039;d want a population that stands up against wrongs when they&#039;re able to.

The old WikiLeaks released the nitty gritty details and didn&#039;t give a fuck about censoring anything. We got helicopters killing civilians, we got Hillary sacrificing to Moloch, we got John Podesta paling around with Stephen Colbert while doing his kiddy Diddy thing.

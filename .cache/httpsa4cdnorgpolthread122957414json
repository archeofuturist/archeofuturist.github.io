Many people in fact did this. Sometimes not even as a business. It was common to purchase a direct connection from a backbone provider, and then sell it to those in your town\/neighborhood in order to subsidize your own internet costs. Basically as a way to get free internet. It&#039;s not so simple anymore. <br><br>But this raises all kinds of questions for the future. Right now (without regulation) you could setup a WISP (wireless internet service provider) that reaches a regional userbase and out compete the big ISPs handily. In 20 years, anyone will be able to do it with basic equipment. WISPs are a huge threat to traditional ISPs that have invested BILLIONS in wired infrastructure across the continental US and in many cases have not received a return on investment. It is in their interest to make sure that the wired broadband paradigm remains in order to make good on their infrastructure investments. NN only helps them in this way.","time":1493253868,"resto":122957414,"id":"WDT9ldIr","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

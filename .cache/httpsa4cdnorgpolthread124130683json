I don&#039;t know whether to ask you or \/k\/ this (you fucks are probably gonna ignore me or something because this thread has nothing to do with Trump) but let&#039;s say an EMP were to hit the US. Those such a weapon exist that it could knock out every piece of electronic in the nation? Lights going off, cars shutting down, planes falling from the sky, etc. And if so how long would it all last? Three days? A week? A month (would this one even be possible)? And also how would the population react? Realistically speaking of course. The civilians, the police\/military, the government, etc.<br><br>Thanks in advance.","filename":"desiretoknowmore","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":512,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":200,"tim":1493941041176,"time":1493941041,"md5":"GcVLhW8+lZeqm4DEDnIELw==","fsize":41541,"resto":0,"id":"zzd1a0aC","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"hey-pol-i-dont-know-whether-to-ask-you-or-k-this","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":124131883,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)19:46:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124130683\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124130683<\/a><br>Even the most powerful of EMP blasts that humans can muster are very localized. If it targeted a choke point\/hub for electricity or communications it could do damage that could, in theory, take months to fully repair. Cars caught within the blast would be useless (older precomputer controlled cars would be dead, but easily repaired). The population would be devastated due to their reliance on electricity and communications. The closer to the blast would obviously be worse. In just that period of months you would see many globalists turn on their very beliefs because they would A. Be very concerned about themselves and their own. B. Would be denied their instant feed to global information.","time":1493941583,"resto":124130683,"id":"DT4SiEkk","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124132836,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)19:53:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124131883\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124131883<\/a><br>Thank you for at least responding.

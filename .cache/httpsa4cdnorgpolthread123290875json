He is asking more nations to jump on the sanctions band wagon so as to stop N. Korea from developing nukes... er so the news says. <br><br>Here is the problem: The U.S. put sanctions on Japan before WWII--similar sanctions. Those sanctions only served to push Japan to war.<br><br>Take for instance China. We trade with China. If we put sanctions on China, China would probably be more aggressive towards us and probably start a war. <br><br>Now, this is clearly a hypothetical, but I think its important to take from history what exactly is going on right now. It seems to me that the U.S. is pushing for a possible nuclear war and is being rather cavalier about it... As if, to build up support to use nukes without the natural horror involved with such an action. Now, perhaps nukes will protect the rare earth from being mined immediately in N. Korea, so they can be accessed later? Idk... But, the nuke threat is real and serves no purpose monetarily other than to quarantine a large area. <br><br>Thoughts?

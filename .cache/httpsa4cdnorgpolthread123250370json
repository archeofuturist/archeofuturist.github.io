Le Pen is France&#039;s last real hope of survival. I go to Paris every couple of years because I love the city and speak the language, the last time I went was October last year and to be honest it did not feel like Paris anymore. The streets were deserted, there were no queues for Notre Dame or any other major tourist attraction, squads of 4-6 soldiers with assault rifles and fingers in the fire ready position roaming the street. Most historical buildings had guardhouses with police officers holding submachine guns outside. Felt like a warzone \/ occupied territory, not Paris.<br><br>Won&#039;t be going back until there is a serious change in French policy, and that starts with Le Pen. If Macron wins, it&#039;s over.","time":1493416506,"resto":123250370,"id":"EVXb2GGZ","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":123251722,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)17:55:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123250370\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123250370<\/a><br>Not all women are retarded you reddit faggot. go back to your le 6 gorrilion chromosomez or some shit.","time":1493416543,"resto":123250370,"id":"8GgDDoDS","country":"LT","country_name":"Lithuania"},{"no":123252027,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)17:58:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123250370\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123250370<\/a><br>LE PEN NUMBER 1","time":1493416683,"resto":123250370,"id":"PIYCMs1H","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"}]}

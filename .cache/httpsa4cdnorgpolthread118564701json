The company, which is still in the earliest stages of existence and has no public presence whatsoever, is centered on creating devices that can be implanted in the human brain, with the eventual purpose of helping human beings merge with software and keep pace with advancements in artificial intelligence. These enhancements could improve memory or allow for more direct interfacing with computing devices.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Musk has hinted at the existence of Neuralink a few times over the last six months or so. More recently, Musk told a crowd in Dubai, \u201cOver time I think we will probably see a closer merger of biological intelligence and digital intelligence.\u201d He added that \u201cit&#039;s mostly about the bandwidth, the speed of the connection between your brain and the digital version of yourself, particularly output.&quot; On Twitter, Musk has responded to inquiring fans about his progress on a so-called \u201cneural lace,\u201d which is sci-fi shorthand for a brain-computer interface humans could use to improve themselves. <\/span><br><br>https:\/\/archive.is\/VKs3T<br><br>http:\/\/www theverge.com\/2017\/3\/27\/15077864\/elo<wbr>n-musk-neuralink-brain-computer-int<wbr>erface-ai-cyborgs","filename":"7ee242bcb76893182c42e8ebe04820f5694dc2f5c9f02dec1880c66ed6644b31","ext":".png","w":935,"h":828,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":221,"tim":1490650119592,"time":1490650119,"md5":"cdR2r3FuMInqG73bKEN\/1A==","fsize":175380,"resto":0,"id":"JHniG4jB","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"elon-musks-new-startup-to-merge-human-brain-and","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":277,"images":45,"unique_ips":159,"tail_size":50},{"no":118565122,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)17:32:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118564701\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118564701<\/a><br>bump","time":1490650336,"resto":118564701,"id":"JHniG4jB","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118565733,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)17:37:45","name":"Anonymous","filename":"1","ext":".png","w":1366,"h":653,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":59,"tim":1490650665822,"time":1490650665,"md5":"0dLD32jlJoFd8Rt9h5aG9Q==","fsize":51341,"resto":118564701,"id":"JHniG4jB","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118565837,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)17:38:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"Who \/cyberpunk\/ here?","time":1490650716,"resto":118564701,"id":"lIY98WGt","country":"LT","country_name":"Lithuania"},{"no":118565927,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)17:39:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"I just want waifus.","filename":"1397493312926","ext":".jpg","w":645,"h":649,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490650760049,"time":1490650760,"md5":"fHMHGL2UTYP9VNDKmzsDrw==","fsize":212579,"resto":118564701,"id":"4uE62SaW","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118566078,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)17:40:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118565927\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118565927<\/a><br>Living forever as a robot sounds better to me","time":1490650833,"resto":118564701,"id":"JHniG4jB","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118566348,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)17:42:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118564701\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118564701<\/a><br>Praise him.","filename":"1293475207479","ext":".png","w":400,"h":400,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490650978077,"time":1490650978,"md5":"FDvovyPKAG2BhZJ\/6VM2Vg==","fsize":65965,"resto":118564701,"id":"OFRXR9Uh","country":"AT","country_name":"Austria"},{"no":118566467,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)17:43:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118564701\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118564701<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;devices that can be implanted in the human brain<\/span><br><br>enjoy your glial scarring, loss of implant sensitivity long-term and ever-present risk of massive infection","time":1490651034,"resto":118564701,"id":"9tl2Jj1w","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118566561,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)17:44:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118566467\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118566467<\/a><br>A small price to pay really","time":1490651080,"resto":118564701,"id":"JHniG4jB","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118566582,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)17:44:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"Soon","filename":"latest","ext":".png","w":600,"h":745,"tn_w":100,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490651089465,"time":1490651089,"md5":"u7wgCjj1fSDnjZn+02Z+OA==","fsize":637714,"resto":118564701,"id":"HzL0TKU4","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118566733,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)17:46:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118566078\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118566078<\/a><br>yeah musk better got on this shit before im \/alzheimer&#039;s\/ in like 60 years","time":1490651165,"resto":118564701,"id":"aHO8nFsv","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118566745,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)17:46:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118566078\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118566078<\/a><br>Astartes &gt;

AI is essentially trying to copy the human capabilities but scale it up and for purpose. The problem is that the physics of the brain are way more efficient than a digitized mind. And especially if you take ENERGY into consideration. Fucking hell. I would believe that you could reach AI that are &quot;smarter&quot; than humans, but they wouldn&#039;t be cost effective at large scale and only used for top-tier research.","time":1490661727,"resto":118564701,"id":"7Of5WhmV","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":118586932,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)20:42:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118586313\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118586313<\/a><br>what if every neuron was replaced one by one with a cyborg equivalent and it was really you?","time":1490661770,"resto":118564701,"id":"GkGTYDcY","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118587014,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)20:43:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118586846\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118586846<\/a><br>Aslo there is quantum computing and many other types of unconventional computing including wetware.","time":1490661813,"resto":118564701,"id":"skf8VgBB","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":118587066,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)20:44:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118571872\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118571872<\/a><br>I can grow up after a thousand years nigger","time":1490661847,"resto":118564701,"id":"09zs3XkI","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118587449,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)20:47:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118571872\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118571872<\/a><br>Nah.

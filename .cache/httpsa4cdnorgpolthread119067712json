He knows that the US pharma system is a total fucking joke and he doesn&#039;t pander. The pill is strong with this one.","time":1490984485,"resto":119067712,"id":"902u9eVd","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119082703,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)14:22:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119069084\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119069084<\/a><br>and where do the insurance companies get the money from?","time":1490984525,"resto":119067712,"id":"VAmC+yeV","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":119083019,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)14:25:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"On advice of counsel I will enact my fifth amendment right against self incrimination and respectfully decline to answer your question.","time":1490984710,"resto":119067712,"id":"dnvjDAgB","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119083288,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)14:27:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119068412\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119068412<\/a>","filename":"st shkreli","ext":".gif","w":480,"h":270,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1490984863372,"time":1490984863,"md5":"ywpRGkDmBaW\/AjjkjYbUcg==","fsize":1727683,"resto":119067712,"id":"cOOGUnu3","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119083488,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)14:29:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119079427\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119079427<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Not having even the most cursory conceptualization of the vast costs of laying out consistent drug production and synthesis to last the course of treatment and the number of people involved in that process (biochemists aren&#039;t cheap), let alone the number of regulators and lawyers (most inefficient bastards on the planet) involved in the regulatory process of both drug approval and production procedures (including subsequent changes to the drug and means of production that may be necessary) as well as the legal costs of protecting your company lawsuits from the very people you are trying to save.<\/span><br><br>I don&#039;t think you know this, but the vast majority of pharmaceutical companies get smoked because of these things and their drugs end up orphan drugs with nobody to produce them.

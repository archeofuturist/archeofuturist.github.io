There&#039;s a class of alcoholic NEETs, like actual alcoholics, who live on \/r9k\/ and \/pol\/. These people&#039;s drug of choice is alcohol because they can get it from a store or their parents fridge without having any friends or connections. Illegal drugs require these things, so they associate all drugs other than alcohol as degenerate and normie.<br><br>2. Alternatively, for the non-NEET\/alcoholics here, you should recognize that drinking is a part of white\/European culture for hundreds of years. Not the case with weed or smokables.

All the answers to the questions on &quot;why we should have diversity&quot; is not even relevant to the question and dodges it. <br>Ask yourself right now on how diversity is good. Can you think of anything? <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;food<\/span><br>Any man in Britain can visit another country and say &quot;Wow, I like this. Let me open up a restaurant and serve this food!&quot; and do so.

Besides food, there seriously is not any benefit to having another culture come into your country and replace yours. Diversity has no purpose. A black man is not going to have a different view of a white man if both grew up in the suburbs. Considering a room full of black men as &quot;diverse&quot; and a room full of different Europeans as &quot;bland&quot; is stupid and we need to stop this.<br><br>How do we deal with this? Go right now and ask a liberal about the benefits of diversity.

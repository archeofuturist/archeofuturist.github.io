Yugoslavia broke apart because even though nations comprising it were similair, they werent the same and national identities were already established by the 20th century. USA succeeded because everyone there abandoned their former nationality and became american, in Yugoslavia its residents didnt want to abandon their nations and many actually opposed &quot;Yugoslavian&quot; nationality that was forcefully pushed by communist party. So you had artificial country with artificial identity, forced upon already existing ones whom citizens never really accepted it in some bigger numbers.

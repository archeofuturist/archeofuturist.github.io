An English translation of this verse reads as follows:;<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Men are the protectors and maintainers of women, because Allah has given the one more (strength) than the other, and because they support them from their means.; Therefore the righteous women are devoutly obedient, and guard in (the husband\u2019s) absence what Allah would have them guard.; As to those women on whose part you fear disloyalty and ill-conduct, admonish them (first), (next) do not share their beds, (and last) beat (tap) them (lightly); but if they return to obedience, seek not against them means (of annoyance): for Allah is Most High, Great (above you all). (4:34)<\/span><br><br>First and foremost, this verse needs two clarifications. One, that it doesn\u2019t apply to any women, but to ONLY those women who are \u201crebellious\u201d to their husbands in acts of immorality, such as lewdness, adultery, and fornication. Second, the issue of hitting is a mere symbolic tapping of the hand as a serious gesture of disgruntlement from the husband towards the wife, for her disobediences in the morality of the household, because its an issue of integrity of the family, which the husband is responsible to maintain the honor and respect of it.","time":1490256971,"resto":117904584,"id":"PytyaC7T","country":"NZ","country_name":"New Zealand"},{"no":117907259,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)04:19:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"So when&#039;s it going to happen boys?

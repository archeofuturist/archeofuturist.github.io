He is continuously caught in the crossfire between the moderates and the far right, just as his predecessor was. He will have his hands full keeping the House together in the future on controversial, \u201chard\u201d votes. The lesson members learned was to look after their own interests. Calling Ryan and Trump\u2019s bluff worked well for them. <br><br>While Ryan loses stature, Trump does not necessarily gain any. Previously he claimed victory merely by decimating the opposition (GOP challengers, Hillary Clinton, a reporter, etc.). Now Ryan\u2019s loss is not Trump\u2019s gain. (It might be Stephen K. Bannon\u2019s gain, but not Trump, who needs to show results.) Trump shares responsibility for a bill he endorsed and lobbied hard to get. (Press secretary Sean Spicer said Trump \u201cleft everything on the field.\u201d) His rallies and threats and his vapid cheerleading count for nothing when it comes to governance. What worked in a campaign no longer serves any useful purpose. <br><br>Trump now will rightly be seen as a weakened, if not inept, president. His attention span lasts only a couple of weeks before, starved for adulation, he moves onto the next thing in search of affirmation. Democrats know this, as do Republican opponents. You can wait this guy out.","time":1490389578,"resto":118129041,"id":"WRlf4WJU","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118131338,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)17:06:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118131127\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118131127<\/a><br>no they were trying to negotiate you idiot","time":1490389578,"resto":118129041,"id":"aYfUU6zV","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118131384,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)17:06:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118131127\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118131127<\/a><br><br>They tried to appease the Freedumb Caucus who still voted against it.

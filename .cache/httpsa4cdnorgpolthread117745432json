Don&#039;t bother trying to get NEETbux, they know you have a degree and automatically assume you&#039;re not applying for jobs, because white men are so privileged that you have no excuse not to have a job. This form of NEET, where you did everything and everyone pretends otherwise whilst making sure you receive absolutely zero assistance, zero encouragement and zero help is possibly the worst feeling someone in the west could feel. These are the only NEETs that deserve sympathy because everyone keeps drilling the bullshit about how they&#039;re responsible for their situation and should feel bad for it.<br><br>I&#039;m sorry, but otherwise you probably deserve it. You deserve to be a NEET if you don&#039;t try. I&#039;ve met NEETs who can&#039;t get jobs because they&#039;re known alcoholics, that&#039;s shitty, but guess what: it was your choice. White men didn&#039;t choose to be white men.<br><br>Otherwise, get a skill, sell that skill. No skills? Sorry, no job.

She rose to lead the firm and become one of Wall Street\u2019s most powerful women. Now, largely unknown outside the industry, Ms. Fitzpatrick faces her biggest and most public challenge yet: working for George Soros, the estimable octogenarian investor and philanthropist.<br><br>Last Monday, she started as chief investment officer of Soros Fund Management, which manages around $26 billion of Mr. Soros\u2019s personal and family wealth. In taking the job, she follows in the footsteps of finance legends including Keith Anderson, a co-founder of BlackRock, and Stanley Druckenmiller, the billionaire investor. Even Steven Mnuchin, the new Treasury secretary, was once brought in to open a lending business.<br><br>Mr. Soros himself is perhaps the finance world\u2019s most famous investor. In 1992, he made a $1 billion bet against the British pound. The trade came to be known as one that \u201cbroke the Bank of England\u201d when Mr. Soros\u2019s heavy selling of the country\u2019s currency helped prompt the government to devalue the pound.<br><br>And Soros is not just another family office designed to maximize wealth. There is a direct link between the money that is made at Soros and its founder\u2019s philanthropic endeavors. Mr. Soros, now 86, is an outspoken supporter of Democrats including Hillary Clinton, and travels the world seeking to promote democracy. The $1 billion that Mr. Soros made betting against the British pound, for example, helped to support scientists in Russia after the fall of the Soviet Union.","filename":"DawnFitzpatrick","ext":".jpg","w":347,"h":382,"tn_w":227,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491727294113,"time":1491727294,"md5":"YxIqM3rFnf3C2DTgwSdhFQ==","fsize":115895,"resto":0,"id":"wGE1SbHZ","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"meet-the-woman-who-controls-soros-money","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":120260296,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)04:43:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"Ooooo","time":1491727390,"resto":120260159,"id":"+7LRz6by","country":"IN","country_name":"India"}]}

Is he really this big of a coward, and of a moron, that he doesn&#039;t think we have all of the footage and quotes?<br><br>Carter Page himself is a Russian agent, there&#039;s an FBI report which he himself acknowledged was about him. The question is simply whether he was too stupid to realize they were using him, or if he actively worked with them. <br><br>But what&#039;s not in question is that Trump still put this man on his team, into a government position, KNOWING FULL WELL that this man had this on his record.","filename":"Cz6XF6JUsAABpjB","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":300,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492980447415,"time":1492980447,"md5":"10Be7fZM5IT\/3Gjv\/fYb0g==","fsize":36276,"resto":0,"id":"lrNYKRdh","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"trump-terrified-of-carter-page","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":1,"unique_ips":1},{"no":122486499,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)16:59:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"Nothing eh?","filename":"5ae71f7a1cc73d2e3affd445f52c4f0f","ext":".jpg","w":480,"h":640,"tn_w":93,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492981187446,"time":1492981187,"md5":"QDqdHNAac7lgnecWX2yyfw==","fsize":67817,"resto":122484607,"id":"lrNYKRdh","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

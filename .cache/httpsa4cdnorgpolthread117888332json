I know Bob Evans and Wendy&#039;s are headquartered here in Ohio, but again, I&#039;m not sure about what else is headquartered here. You&#039;d need to do your own research on that. If you do move to Ohio, you&#039;ll want to live in one of the smaller cities or towns that surround Columbus, just stay out of Franklin County. <br><br>The real redpill on Ohio? There really isn&#039;t much to say. It&#039;s just like any other state. You steer clear of the larger cities, and you&#039;ll have a comfy life. It&#039;s the perfect blend of urban and rural, industrial and agricultural. For this, I think it&#039;s why we&#039;re always been a swing state for over a hundred years now. The two groups balance each other out. Although, we seem to be moving farther to the right since the Republicans in the state government did a good job at pulling us out of the recession much quicker than the rest of the country. Most importantly though, there&#039;s a saying that says &quot;as goes Ohio, so goes the nation,&quot; and I think it couldn&#039;t be more true. We&#039;re a good representation of how the entire nation feels. <br><br>I&#039;ll add this last bit: one big benefit to living in Ohio is that we&#039;re big enough population wise to matter and reap the benefits of being a bigger state, but we&#039;re not that well known to the outside that we have to deal with all the bad shit that happens everywhere else.","time":1490252551,"resto":117888332,"id":"m2EBaUBq","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117901825,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)03:04:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117901700\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117901700<\/a><br>We also don&#039;t have tourists to deal with (besides Cedar Point.)","time":1490252652,"resto":117888332,"id":"XaP+Rzr3","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117901893,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)03:04:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117888332\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117888332<\/a><br>Ohio sucks.

I&#039;m your age, though markedly less succesful. And I&#039;ve found no reason for proper motivation in life.<br><br>Personally, I think society has changed to the point where people can fall through the cracks in larger numbers. Socialism has destroyed the support networks that a lot of people counted on: Family and community. Of course, corporatist capitalism helped them along quite nicely, and thanks to them the job market is now so tits-up that many of my friends moved away and my sister was forced to find a job in another country. The left wants you to depend on nothing but the state, and the cuck right wants you to depend on nothing but corporations. Together they have struck a devil&#039;s deal.<br><br>The left has also dismantled national identity through its incessant policing of anything that is not left wing, importing as many pro-left non-Westerners as humanly possible, filling every empty moment with treacherous propaganda.<br><br>I have no sense of duty because the worth of it has been removed entirely from our society. The only people who are afforded this right are left wing extremists, some of whom sit in a building not to far from my house, which they received free of charge from the city, plotting actions that would be against the law and lead to a hefty prison sentence for anyone who isn&#039;t a left wing extremist.<br><br>I&#039;m too old now to hope for a better future. Even among my friends I&#039;m politically isolated, as they incessantly parrot left wing propaganda, and I know I&#039;d lose them if I&#039;d go against the grain every time they say another asinine truism that we&#039;ve debunked again and again among ourselves.<br><br>I do have one hope: To see it all burn.

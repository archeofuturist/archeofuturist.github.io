Once those details are finalized, the event will be posted on Eventbrite, he said. Coulter will speak on the topic of illegal immigration, he added.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The Coulter event would come just months after a scheduled appearance at UC Berkeley by former Breitbart news editor Milo Yiannopoulos was canceled after some 100 to 150 masked people threw rocks, broke windows and set fires outside the student union building during an otherwise peaceful protest. The canceled Feb. 1 event, also sponsored by the Berkeley College Republicans, was part of Yiannopoulos\u2019 \u201cDangerous Faggot\u201d tour of several campuses.<\/span>","filename":"coulter","ext":".jpg","w":482,"h":700,"tn_w":172,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492398551175,"time":1492398551,"md5":"wTcru7mPhUiLGuAobtVCBw==","fsize":44059,"resto":0,"id":"GVDK1D5z","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"rightwing-star-ann-coulter-to-speak-at-uc","country_name":"United States","replies":26,"images":5,"unique_ips":21},{"no":121470287,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)23:10:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"She&#039;s obviously just baiting because she wants to see them pathetically chimp out for her just like they did for Milo.","time":1492398627,"resto":121470095,"id":"aAOeQ0Q5","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121470401,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)23:11:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"why would I go riot for this cunt?","time":1492398673,"resto":121470095,"id":"Jxp5mntd","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121471172,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)23:17:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121470401\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121470401<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Why would I support one of the most outspoken pro-trump voices today?<\/span>","time":1492399033,"resto":121470095,"id":"GVDK1D5z","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121472370,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)23:27:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121470095\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121470095<\/a><br><br>How tight will security be?","time":1492399631,"resto":121470095,"id":"KHLTEl3w","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121472551,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)23:28:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121470095\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121470095<\/a><br><br>She will speak or make a porn with the basketball team???","time":1492399716,"resto":121470095,"id":"1XaCiyDW","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":121473001,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)23:32:10","name":"Zoot","com":"Ann Coulter is a cunt who will say anything that supports Ann Coulter","time":1492399930,"resto":121470095,"id":"t26X7MSz","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121473199,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)23:33:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"So, you guys want to talk strategy in the case of those antifags going on the offensive?

According to a survey published Monday of reserve managers at 80 central banks, who together are responsible for investments worth almost \u20ac6trn, the stability of the monetary union is their greatest fear for 2017. The results \u2014 compiled by trade publication Central Banking Publications and the bank HSBC earlier this year \u2014 show some respondents have cut their entire exposure to the euro, while others have reduced their holdings of investments denominated in euros to the bare minimum. More than two-thirds of the 80 central banks had changed their portfolio allocation, while roughly that same amount had changed the duration of their investments. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Developing and emerging-market central banks, some of which are among the world\u2019s biggest reserves holders, were more likely than those from advanced economies to have shifted out of the euro. The UK\u2019s decision to quit the EU has not affected the popularity of sterling as an investment currency so far, with 71 per cent of respondents saying the attractiveness of the pound was undimmed in the longer term. While central bankers said they would become more cautious about investing in the pound over the next few years, the survey showed many believe Brexit could provide an opportunity for them to diversify their portfolios further into the future. Almost 80 per cent of respondents said the election of Donald Trump had not changed their overall view on the US dollar.<\/span>","time":1491284741,"resto":119423259,"id":"BfPqjs5z","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119437340,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)01:45:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119436942\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119436942<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;reform the EU<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;privatise everything<\/span><br>vs<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;LEAVE the EU<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;LEAVE the Euro<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;BAN dual citizenship, <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;especially from Israel, sending the jews back<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;further restrictions on islam, including banning hijab as well as the burqa that is currently banned<\/span><br>I don&#039;t know, laddo, tough choice.","time":1491284745,"resto":119423259,"id":"lycoP\/Hy","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119437377,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)01:46:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119437036\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119437036<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Just over a third of the respondents, around half of which were from emerging market central banks, said their concerns over the European single-currency area were based on growing political instability in Europe, which has seen anti-EU parties across the continent secure a larger share of the popular vote in recent years. The ECB\u2019s negative interest rate policy \u2014 intended to spur growth across the eurozone \u2014 was identified as another key driver of divestment. The policy, in place since the summer of 2014, has triggered complaints from private banks across Europe, who say it has eaten into their profits. The deposit rate in the eurozone is now minus 0.4 per cent \u2014 meaning that lenders in effect pay a levy of that amount on their reserves parked at central banks.<\/span>","time":1491284771,"resto":119423259,"id":"BfPqjs5z","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119437611,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)01:49:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119437333\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119437333<\/a><br><a href=\"#p119437377\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119437377<\/a><br>HAHAHAHAHAHA EU BTFO<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;b-b-but y-you will b-be poor and b-banks w-will leave u!!!1!1!11<\/span><br><br>Cheers mate.","time":1491284945,"resto":119423259,"id":"zvg+QRs0","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119437683,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)01:49:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119437223\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119437223<\/a><br>France can do it.

I stumbled on a program called Basic4GL back in the day which was just BASIC with built in OpenGL bindings and downloaded it at my friend&#039;s house. It came with a few tutorials and example programs but not much. I went home and just learned on my own by breaking the example programs and trying to make sense of the tutorials. After about a month I managed to make my first game which was just a clone of that Impossible Game where you&#039;re a box jumping over obstacles. I still didn&#039;t know what for loops were at this point so every level of the game was basically me copy and pasting huge sections of game logic over and over.<br><br>Then I started playing ArmA 2 and learned that you could write scripts for it. So I started making shitty mods for the game and learned more basics of programming like for loops, logic and so on. Got better at that until I was releasing mods.<br><br>Then I heard about Minecraft and I enjoyed playing it and I learned it was made in something called Java. So I looked up Java and watched a few videos, then decided to DL an IDE and get to work. Took about a month before I was confident in it. Made a few games and programs and shit, then grew tired of the class system so decided to learn C. Still not very good at C yet, I learn sparingly these days. Now I&#039;m starting to grow more fond of Java because it requires less time investment which is good for me because I&#039;m a lazy cunt. Only learned web development a few months ago.","time":1491290487,"resto":119423259,"id":"zvg+QRs0","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119444387,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)03:22:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119443316\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119443316<\/a><br>They are great in person, but the internet brings out stray dogs, mate, the type that even small villages shun.","time":1491290578,"resto":119423259,"id":"5eUkzYdW","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119444437,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)03:23:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119423614\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119423614<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;multiculturalism for the west!<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;poland for poles!<\/span><br><br>Fuck them.","time":1491290628,"resto":119423259,"id":"7LNK+EkZ","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119444572,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)03:26:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119444187\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119444187<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;it may be harsh is that I really don&#039;t like the formatting.<\/span><br><br>Nah.

Bullets face down and towards the dominant hand so you can pull flat on top and turn upward. This puts your hand cradling the BOTTOM of the magazine so if there is grit and water you dont have to worry about it slipping since its sitting flat in your hand. Plus, with shorter magazines ESPECIALLY handgun magazines having your hand on the bottom plate is an absolute necessity since it will end up flush with the well. Having mags set that way opens them up to debris and damage that a good pouch would prevent. Plus for rapid mag changes and even tac-mag changes you will have to change your hand position two or more times to properly manipulate magazine.

If we strive to promote the Europeans elements and discourage the non-European elements then should Christianity be discouraged? <br>Not eradicated but maybe it should not be the majority religion. It&#039;s Semitic and an abrahamic religion, even though it has had a long history in Europe should we really still follow it? A lot of the guys in the alt right have problems with this. We see the new-pagan movement getting small amounts of attention, Christians and agnostics. Paganism always seemed larpy to me but after some research it holds a lot of our cultural values which allows us to respect our individual ethnicities. <br><br>I would like to hear other opinions on this. Religion general I suppose. Muslimtard trolls gfto. The only real options are paganism, Christianity or secularism.","filename":"IMG_0850","ext":".jpg","w":736,"h":1075,"tn_w":171,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490613961933,"time":1490613961,"md5":"ldQPRu6YbJv42I0NsdDD6w==","fsize":116162,"resto":0,"id":"qczbv2iS","country":"GB","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"yo-polacks-i-was-thinking-about-the-nature-of","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":2,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":118503654,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)07:33:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118503070\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118503070<\/a><br>s-Salaam-Alaikum my Muslim brother","time":1490614430,"resto":118503070,"id":"osSrbFkf","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118503902,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)07:36:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118503654\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118503654<\/a><br>Salaam Alaikum.

People who have no business programming are taking it up, because they want a job and they want money (and they heard about the good pay and shit). What these retards don&#039;t realise is that doing a course won&#039;t magically raise their IQ. All these hordes of people who&#039;ve never excelled at anything in life (otherwise they would keep doing that), who never stood out in any regard, who picked marketing studies or economics, think that the only reason they don&#039;t have a cushy office job with a nice salary is that they bet on the wrong horse. They think that their only problem in life is that they picked economics (to get cushy office job - their only goal in life), which was saturated, instead of computer science, which wasn&#039;t saturated. If only they picked the right thing. they would be home free.<br><br>They are in for a rude surprise. They see tons of other people doing the exact same thing, which means by the time they are done, there&#039;s going to be a ton of similar retards on the job market. Which is just going to cause wages to plummet. <br><br>Javascript frontend programmers are already the lowest paid type of programmer. Whenever we&#039;re hiring we can instantly find javascript devs or iOS\/Android devs. Lots of chicks too.

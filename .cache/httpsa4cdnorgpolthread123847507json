He&#039;s running for governor in 2018 and will most likely win. <br><br>He&#039;s 6&#039;3&quot;, handsome, well-spoken and charismatic. He&#039;s pro-populism and critical of globalization and automation. As a FUCKING WHITE MALE roman catholic, he could probably win back blue dog democrats that Hillary lost. Yet he&#039;s also well-liked and has a good reputation among progressives. With the right VP he could have both sides on board. He was the leader of the movement to legalize DUDE WEED LMAO in California which will probably be a $100B industry by 2020. <br><br>He probably won&#039;t run for POTUS in 2020, but if he does, what do you think are his chances? If you still like Trump, I think this is the guy you should be worried about.","filename":"130206_gavin_newsom_ap_605","ext":".jpg","w":605,"h":328,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":135,"tim":1493772967182,"time":1493772967,"md5":"+kVankxcBc\/+IXZ10y3K8w==","fsize":44544,"resto":0,"id":"TfWgqZHl","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"gavin-newsom-2020","country_name":"United States","replies":13,"images":2,"unique_ips":11},{"no":123847718,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)20:57:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123847507\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123847507<\/a><br>I&#039;ll keep an eye on him.","time":1493773060,"resto":123847507,"id":"XpHgq4J3","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123847883,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)20:59:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"Please lord kek make this man go away.

In Poland people almost always chose the cheaper brand. I just bought all of that shit for cheap for around 7 bucks. If I bought well known brands it would cost me at least twice as much. How are these expensive fuckers able to survive? Are they subsidizing their products in Poland like Germans do in their gay Lidls and Kauflands?","filename":"tmp_10534-20170422_130257743707209","ext":".jpg","w":2592,"h":1944,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1492859449181,"time":1492859449,"md5":"GXmqxzpsoGsnhw5ura4Y3w==","fsize":2092076,"resto":0,"id":"JmZShO9l","country":"PL","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"capitalism-101","country_name":"Poland","replies":7,"images":0,"unique_ips":4},{"no":122265727,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)07:12:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122265608\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122265608<\/a><br>Clearly most people in poland don&#039;t buy the cheaper brand otherwise they wouldnt be in business.","time":1492859539,"resto":122265608,"id":"abDfjwiz","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122266355,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)07:20:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122265727\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122265727<\/a><br>I believe this is a conspiracy.<br><br>https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/busines<wbr>s\/2015\/jul\/02\/lidl-1bn-public-devel<wbr>opment-funding-supermarket-world-ba<wbr>nk-eastern-europe","time":1492860003,"resto":122265608,"id":"JmZShO9l","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":122267457,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)07:33:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122265608\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122265608<\/a><br>Company one sells 100 of product, gaining 1$ for each.

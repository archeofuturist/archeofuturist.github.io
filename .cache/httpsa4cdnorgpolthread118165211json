You have to remember that back when the racial tension was at its worst in the 20th century america, the 60s\/70s, the KKK were still reviled and was enough of a point of contention that republicans lost the 1964 elections because of it.<br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=4hc<wbr>pedQmOyo<br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=LiG<wbr>0AE8zdTU<br>This is all well documented. Racism has never had a popular foothold in this country past WW2. Is the legacy there? Of course. Are there racists? Yes, immigrants or otherwise.<br><br>But to pretend that everyone not with you is racist, that the main issue in the 2016 election was an issue of race (and when the alternative to Trump was a white woman who literally used the word &quot;super predators&quot; to describe blacks) is ludicrous. Right wing America is not Nazi germany. Nazis don&#039;t argue for smaller government. Nazis don&#039;t let you publish whatever the fuck you want. This is why ANTIFA has very little support in the united states. They resemble the nazis more than the people they fight.<br><br>By the way, there are no records of ANTIFA showing up to Klan gatherings. The first record I found was one in Vancouver - a condemnation, nothing more from what it looks like.<br><br>So you be the judge. What is ANTIFA?","time":1490406592,"resto":118165211,"id":"f3s086Bu","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118168216,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)21:51:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118165211\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118165211<\/a><br>They&#039;re not actually racist.

(This increased to 8 percent when adjusted for contraceptive use.)<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In short, women are at least twice as likely to conceive as a result of rape than by consensual sex.<\/span><br><br>Why Should Pregnancy Be More Common During Rape?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Why does rape result in increased risk of pregnancy? This remains an open question. The Gottschalls reject some possibilities. These include the idea that rape induces ovulation, (copulation does stimulate the release of an egg in some species), that rapists have more virile sperm, and that rapists possess a special capacity to detect women who are ovulating. They do toss out a couple of conjectures they consider reasonable. The first is that rapists target women who are particularly fertile based on factors such as beauty and age. The second is that women unconsciously \u201cbroadcast cues about their ovulatory status that men are capable of registering and interpreting.\u201d These hypothetical unconscious cues could be physiological (e.g. body odor, subtle changes in skin tone) or behavioral. To their credit, however, the authors admit that there is little evidence to support their conjectures.<\/span>","filename":"Barbara-Palvin-by-Terry-Richardson-1-1","ext":".jpg","w":1050,"h":500,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":119,"tim":1492881865701,"time":1492881865,"md5":"PedLup8NNxDxYxKff7zjYg==","fsize":89861,"resto":0,"id":"k\/BaP6Bz","country":"GB","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"women-are-twice-as-likely-to-conceive-as-a-result","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":121,"images":20,"unique_ips":87,"tail_size":50},{"no":122301478,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)13:25:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"Human Nature<br>March 2003, Volume 14, Issue 1, pp 1\u201320<br><br>Are per-incident rape-pregnancy rates higher than per-incident consensual pregnancy rates?","time":1492881959,"resto":122301278,"id":"k\/BaP6Bz","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122301496,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)13:26:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122301278\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122301278<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;the drumpftard doesn&#039;t know that rape is about power and not about sex<\/span>","time":1492881968,"resto":122301278,"id":"sbXGYlTK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122301809,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)13:28:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122301478\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122301478<\/a><br>likely<br>a fertile couple can try for months or years to conceive but it seems like every actual rape case ends in pregnancy if the chick isnt on birth control","time":1492882118,"resto":122301278,"id":"hLpMb2JT","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122301924,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)13:29:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122301278\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122301278<\/a><br><br>The study doesn&#039;t even define rape.

Men are the actors of the species struggle for life and are equipped with superior rationality, intelligence and strength to manipulate their environment to their advantage and propagate the species. Women accommodate this struggle by bearing life and sustaining it. Men are given a large diversity of different abilities and shortfalls as nature will experiment more with them. The reason for this is because on the rare occasion this experimentation results in an extraordinarily effectively reproducing male he will be able to spread his genes far wider than a female ever could. Think of Genghis Khan impregnating thousands of women whereas a woman can only have a dozen children maximum and may die in the process. So nature has no incentive to create &quot;extraordinary&quot;, outlier or gifted women because they do not exist in the reproductive paradigm to capitalize as greatly on that. Nature does not create gifted women. Women exist as only carriers of genes, whereas men are the living expression of them.","time":1492890800,"resto":122301278,"id":"mFIHdDou","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"},{"no":122319845,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)16:02:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122318831\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122318831<\/a><br>first good potato post i&#039;ve seen. saved. have this.","filename":"1481911966418","ext":".png","w":974,"h":669,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":85,"tim":1492891342496,"time":1492891342,"md5":"LAGB3HFgWcbroNI4uO7quw==","fsize":85390,"resto":122301278,"id":"nRDlEXQY","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122321944,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)16:20:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122301278\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122301278<\/a><br>Not withstanding the women who are murdered after being raped.

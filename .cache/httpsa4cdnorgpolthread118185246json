And it has quite the history with its older games and the weird fandom. Even stores like hot topic sold the merchandise. <br>Well what if, taking advantage of said popularity we get a harmless hashtag trending. Say #triforce its innocent and a widely recognizable thing from the game but using it we get some facts out on twitter with keks and finesse. Or even on tumblr using their large base. <br>I like this idea. Better than using harry potter. I wonder what the facts could be about. <br>Pic unrelated","filename":"1489451884638","ext":".gif","w":612,"h":611,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":249,"tim":1490416079446,"time":1490416079,"md5":"n1CDCWEV7KQ8FzN0Zbxp+Q==","fsize":693531,"resto":0,"id":"1GRf0giE","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"triforce-i-think-we-can-do-it","country_name":"United States","replies":5,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":118185457,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)00:30:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"How would you say this would be pulled off?

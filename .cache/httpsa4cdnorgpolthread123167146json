Biden was well liked and Clinton was mired in disapproval of her character, which would only be exacerbated by a nasty personal fight. That could damage her chances in the general election, even if she was able to defeat the vice president in the primary. Biden\u2019s penchant for saying impolitic things would be an area ripe for exploitation for the Clinton team. He, and his legacy, would suffer. While they fought over who had the better style, Sanders would float above the mudslinging by continuing to focus on issues. \u201cIt\u2019s ticky-tack shit that would just not be good and then they would grate on each other and then it would be a downward spiral,\u201d the Clinton aide said.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The obsession over loyalty signaled just how much pressure Hillary\u2019s team was under at a time when she should have been cruising toward an easy nomination. Sanders was gaining ground; Biden, who could steal from her bases of moderate white Democrats and African Americans, was looking at getting in; and she couldn\u2019t buy a day free from her suffocating e-mail scandal.<\/span>","filename":"1472398472942","ext":".png","w":1024,"h":530,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":64,"tim":1493366297462,"time":1493366297,"md5":"o69OzNi8LUcdyOQOAQQKbw==","fsize":775732,"resto":123167146,"id":"yK1vmHhz","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123167241,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)03:58:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"somebody redpill me on the wendy&#039;s shit","time":1493366299,"resto":123167146,"id":"Gdri2E1t","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123167301,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)03:59:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"Bill Nye is a retard","time":1493366343,"resto":123167146,"id":"9GYSwqmn","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123167309,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)03:59:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"Reddit is still down, for longer than expected. <br><br>If it isn&#039;t up by 7am EST shit is gonna be annoying.","filename":"BRACE","ext":".png","w":828,"h":669,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":100,"tim":1493366350983,"time":1493366350,"md5":"qIV0jxbyVEyIVVWR\/qmd0Q==","fsize":35368,"resto":123167146,"id":"vHQTJFXd","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123167310,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)03:59:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123167241\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123167241<\/a><br>I personally think it&#039;s the \/r9k\/ Little Caesar&#039;s guy.","time":1493366351,"resto":123167146,"id":"l6+ew8+n","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123167312,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)03:59:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"Who&#039;s ready to bring freedom to mars?","filename":"04-trump-nasa.w710.h473.2x","ext":".jpg","w":1420,"h":946,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":83,"tim":1493366350680,"time":1493366350,"md5":"FtZ14y\/eZoWs66PR5R++6A==","fsize":125348,"resto":123167146,"id":"fCwomE\/a","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":123167330,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)03:59:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"REAL ALEWD HOURS.<br><br><br>WHO \/LEWD\/?","filename":"1492069489633","ext":".png","w":900,"h":900,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493366367105,"time":1493366367,"md5":"Dwws8tlZ8xgLBA3NpnBHeA==","fsize":315152,"resto":123167146,"id":"jO\/q1SKR","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123167351,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)03:59:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"Kero Kero.","filename":"1486019137502","ext":".jpg","w":630,"h":891,"tn_w":88,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493366387522,"time":1493366387,"md5":"8py6iBSl9cMeFZhleugh5Q==","fsize":164354,"resto":123167146,"id":"CIP8\/QK2","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123167367,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)03:59:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/123161921#p123162217\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123162217<\/a><br>Much less than that till NRA rally.<br>SHALL","time":1493366396,"resto":123167146,"id":"2M8Dn3ky","country":"HU","country_name":"Hungary"},{"no":123167378,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)04:00:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123167241\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123167241<\/a><br>gorilla marketing","time":1493366407,"resto":123167146,"id":"AYzIFovF","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123167379,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)04:00:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123167309\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123167309<\/a><br>Antisemitism works","filename":"awooschwitz","ext":".png","w":1429,"h":901,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":78,"tim":1493366407675,"time":1493366407,"md5":"zki4k1lPa8+8KRJX+PbPDA==","fsize":2311664,"resto":123167146,"id":"l6+ew8+n","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":123167381,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)04:00:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123167235\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123167235<\/a><br>How has Rick not killed himself yet?","time":1493366410,"resto":123167146,"id":"lyYXXJyY","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123167389,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)04:00:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"Fuck Republicans.

But, they promised, the real Hillary would emerge following Labor Day weekend.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;That Hillary, they claimed, was relatable to nearly anyone, downright funny, and didn\u2019t take herself too seriously. More than anything, they said, she was authentic. The image makeover was timed to preview Clinton\u2019s appearances on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, and countless other lighthearted programs where Clinton would dance the Nae Nae, reveal that she kept up with the Kardashians and Homeland, and ask hosts to playfully tug on her hair. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Buell was displeased. By announcing a strategy to make Hillary seem more real, her team had actually achieved the opposite effect. Clinton supporters across the country read it the same way. It was a pure what-the-fuck moment\u2014a major unforced error that buttressed qualms about Hillary\u2019s honesty and trustworthiness at a terrible time. Buell, channeling the collective outrage of the pro-Clinton forces, scolded Mook.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u201cWhy would you say something like that?\u201d Buell demanded. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing more disingenuous than having the campaign quoted within the article.\u201d Mook didn\u2019t have a good explanation because there was no good explanation. Instead, he defended himself by assuring her that the campaign\u2019s data looked strong.<\/span>","filename":"1484950461711","ext":".gif","w":320,"h":320,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493366906870,"time":1493366906,"md5":"RytNpGmFcthKXzhkheWVvA==","fsize":2749869,"resto":123167146,"id":"yK1vmHhz","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123168086,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)04:08:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123167837\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123167837<\/a><br>This artist makes the fucking hottest Touhous hands-down.","time":1493366922,"resto":123167146,"id":"dd7ffx6l","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123168087,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)04:08:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"what are they planning?","filename":"C931qFOWAAEStXL","ext":".jpg","w":720,"h":960,"tn_w":93,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493366922593,"time":1493366922,"md5":"paXvNoweCqxZaEJymatfWA==","fsize":135091,"resto":123167146,"id":"uRv+6Vos","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123168097,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)04:08:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123167949\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123167949<\/a><br>Everyone hates Israel but yeah, he&#039;s probably a Palestine fag, even though everyone in the Arab world hates Palestinians for being ungrateful dog fuckers.","time":1493366927,"resto":123167146,"id":"uzy4V3yf","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":123168111,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)04:08:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123167724\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123167724<\/a><br>Where is their diversity?","filename":"pol celebrates diversity","ext":".png","w":1540,"h":1427,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":115,"tim":1493366938333,"time":1493366938,"md5":"0qQ1ioUJHelGucDIRLkTBA==","fsize":2650700,"resto":123167146,"id":"NUxGpct8","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":123168126,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)04:09:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123167724\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123167724<\/a><br><a href=\"#p123167844\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123167844<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;shirt<\/span><br>neat<br><br>Related, there is a leftist version of Holocaust denial, as well.

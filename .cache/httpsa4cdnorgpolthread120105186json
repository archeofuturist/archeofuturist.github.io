She had advised Kushner, who has sprawling financial interests in a multi-billion-dollar global real estate empire, on how he might comply with federal ethics and anti-nepotism laws. She has argued that although officials leading federal agencies are barred from hiring relatives, the White House is not an agency and thus exempt.[18] Gorelick argued that if Kushner forgoes a White House salary, he would not be bound by federal nepotism rules.[19] Though Kushner has no experience in government or public policy, Trump directed that during his Presidential transition all foreign-policy matters be relayed through Kushner. Kushner participated in meetings between Trump and foreign heads of state while continuing to run the Kushner Companies.[20]<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Jami<wbr>e_Gorelick<\/span>","time":1491638387,"resto":120105186,"id":"xdiLsjV7","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"}]}

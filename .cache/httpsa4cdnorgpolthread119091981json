Yes, there is hatred in the world, that doesn&#039;t mean humans are inherently evil.","time":1491002047,"resto":119091981,"id":"j2NJupgC","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119113269,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)19:14:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119112879\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119112879<\/a><br>I don&#039;t entirely disagree.

The operation spanned over 30 federal, state and local law enforcement agencies in Los Angeles, California. This is the largest human trafficking bust in the history of the United States. I question why this information has not spread farther and faster than it has.<br><br>Joe Fritzl imprisons some sex slaves in his basement, and it&#039;s international news.<br><br>In the whole of 2014 the number of human trafficking offenses in the US was 443, and 120 of those were cleared of charges.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;https:\/\/ucr.fbi.gov\/crime-in-the-u<wbr>.s\/2014\/crime-in-the-u.s.-2014\/addi<wbr>tional-reports\/human-trafficking-re<wbr>port\/human-trafficking.pdf <\/span><br>This means that in 2014 the TOTAL charges of human trafficking were 323. In 2017, since Jan 27th, in a single month of the Trump presidency there were 1627 arrests for human trafficking. <br><br>This means if the same ratio of arrests vs cleared is applied, there were 323 convictions in the whole of 2014 under Obama versus 1186 people in one month under Trump. As of April 5th, there were more than 3,500 arrests across the USA. If anyone doubts Trump is not going after human trafficking networks by now, get jej&#039;d, faggot.","filename":"1500 in one month","ext":".jpg","w":1335,"h":1245,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":233,"tim":1491445793084,"time":1491445793,"md5":"X\/IcgvH2hBUAQ6cSPzOMgg==","fsize":494720,"resto":0,"id":"YhiMoxq\/","country":"IM","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"largest-human-trafficking-bust-in-us-history","country_name":"Isle of Man","replies":10,"images":3,"unique_ips":7},{"no":119692378,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)22:32:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119692152\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119692152<\/a><br>It&#039;s the FBI going after them thanks to the pizzagate shit and the elite lefties being too flagrant","filename":"2016-11-07 21_28_25-Llewellyn Hinkes-Jones (@llewhinkes) \u2022 Instagram photos and videos","ext":".png","w":935,"h":603,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":80,"tim":1491445926201,"time":1491445926,"md5":"ERQh5+wMBAGVd6OXRONCIA==","fsize":891616,"resto":119692152,"id":"2kqTTgVW","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119692495,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)22:33:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119692152\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119692152<\/a><br>None of those are related to pizzagate","time":1491445990,"resto":119692152,"id":"5yhaRIZr","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119692610,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)22:34:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"They&#039;ll have to report on it sooner or later, bound to be news soon when they catch some important people.","time":1491446059,"resto":119692152,"id":"SY2dcKvJ","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":119692982,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)22:37:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119692152\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119692152<\/a><br>Hell yeah, Sheriff Grady Judd!

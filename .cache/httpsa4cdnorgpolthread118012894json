The fireball was widely seen, being spotted over Canada and Detroit, but was not reported on at all by NASA, which reported on many other fireballs at the time.<br><br>Locals report seeing a large, acorn-like object with writing resembling hieroglyphics around the base. The military was on the scene within an hour, cordoning the area off, searching the woods with geiger counters and radiation suits, and taking away something on a flatbed. The military then claimed that absolutely nothing fell from the sky over Kecksburg.<br>Project Blue Book says the same thing, that no object was found, but all eye witnesses disagree.<br><br>A local journalist named John Murphy was preparing a radio documentary about the incident when he was approached by two men in black suits who spoke to him in a back room for 30 minutes. After this, the version of the documentary he aired was heavily censored and did not mention an object. Radio station staff as well as his wife agree that the version of the documentary aired was NOT the original he had written. He refused to speak about the UFO incident after this.<br><br>In 2003, the SciFi channel commissioned an investigation, which found trees at the alleged crash site were damaged in a way consistent with something falling from the sky and dated the damage to 1965. The investigators also spoke with NASA&#039;s chief scientist for orbital debris, who said definitively that it was mathematically impossible for the object to be debris from a Russian satellite which had fallen over Canada earlier on the same day:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I can tell you categorically, that there is no way that any debris from Kosmos 96 could have landed in Pennsylvania anywhere around 4:45 p.m. [...] That\u2019s an absolute. Orbital mechanics is very strict.<\/span>","filename":"kecksburg-newspaper[1]","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":460,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":191,"tim":1490316016788,"time":1490316016,"md5":"ScUUUFW6g9Waz40NylAGlQ==","fsize":61104,"resto":0,"id":"KEucgE\/O","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-kecksburg-ufo","country_name":"United States","replies":3,"images":1,"unique_ips":3},{"no":118012929,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)20:40:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"In 2005, a full 40 years after the incident, NASA announced that they had determined it was debris from a &quot;Russian satellite.&quot; They also claimed that nearly all of their data on the incident was missing or had been destroyed. A FOIA lawsuit resulted in NASA wasting so much time that the judge angrily demanded that they hand over what they had:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The judge, who had tried to move NASA along for more than 3 years, angrily referred to NASA&#039;s previous search efforts as a &quot;ball of yarn&quot; that never fully answered the request, adding, &quot;I can sense the plaintiff&#039;s frustration because I&#039;m frustrated.&quot;<\/span><br><br>However, NASA continued to claim that much of their information was missing.

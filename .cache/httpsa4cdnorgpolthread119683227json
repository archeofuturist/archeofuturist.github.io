But it\u2019s well below the 559 hate crimes the city saw in 2001, the year of the Sept. 11 terror attacks, which was the highest number this century.<br><br>Levin said the surge in hate crimes is largely due to a spike in violent aggravated assaults, racially and ethnically motivated crimes and crimes against LGBT communities.<br><br>There was a nearly 64 percent increase in violent aggravated assaults from 22 to 36, according to Los Angeles Police Department data. Criminal threats rose 33 percent from 27 in 2015 to 36 last year.<br><br>The data also showed a 25 percent increase in hate crimes against the LGBT community from 49 to 61. Hate crimes against transgender persons jumped from 2 in 2015 to 8 in 2016, according to the LAPD data.<br><br>\u201cThis is unfortunate because our study last year showed a significant increase nationwide in anti-transgender attacks that would appear to be continuing into the following year,\u201d Levin said.<br><br>Such incidents, and particularly the killing of four transgender black women in the U.S. in the span of about a week in March of this year, are \u201cworrisome,\u201d he said.<br><br>There was also a 19 percent rise in racially and ethnically motivated crimes last year over the previous year.<br><br>African-Americans were targeted the most, with 54 victims reported last year, up from 48 the year before, according to the data.","filename":"thinking","ext":".gif","w":600,"h":600,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491440482565,"time":1491440482,"md5":"ah4mHLVt6XNisqPO\/TwbSQ==","fsize":920073,"resto":0,"id":"G5C5gMqB","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"why-are-antigay-hate-crimes-on-the-rise","country_name":"United States","replies":6,"images":1,"unique_ips":7},{"no":119683593,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)21:04:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119683227\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119683227<\/a><br>More faggots means more faggot related crimes?","time":1491440686,"resto":119683227,"id":"y+9xrZq5","country":"IT","country_name":"Italy"},{"no":119683860,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)21:07:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119683227\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119683227<\/a><br>for what it&#039;s worth, the same brian levin saved a kkk member from potentially being beaten to death at a klan rally a year ago.<br><br>here&#039;s the link: <br><br>http:\/\/www.latimes.com\/local\/lanow\/<wbr>la-me-ln-klan-rally-in-anaheim-erup<wbr>ts-in-violence-one-man-stabbed-2016<wbr>0227-story.html","time":1491440840,"resto":119683227,"id":"bNAjJvdm","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119683937,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)21:08:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"Hey homo, whatcha doin?","time":1491440883,"resto":119683227,"id":"U26Om9KB","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119684457,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)21:13:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119683227\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119683227<\/a><br>by relaxing in the fight and enabling fascists<br>we are heading to a rise on violence on ethnic and sexual minorities","time":1491441205,"resto":119683227,"id":"wykYeQYk","country":"IT","country_name":"Italy"},{"no":119685744,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)21:26:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"More hispanic immigrants<br><br>That&#039;s it, not even memeing","time":1491441981,"resto":119683227,"id":"0NEv9oVi","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119685857,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)21:27:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119685744\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119685744<\/a><br>Maybe these immigrants aren&#039;t as bad as I thought.","filename":"tears","ext":".png","w":1280,"h":720,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1491442055093,"time":1491442055,"md5":"FkVMpi2HJoG7xUB9+iXpZA==","fsize":724704,"resto":119683227,"id":"mt3i7RyM","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"}]}

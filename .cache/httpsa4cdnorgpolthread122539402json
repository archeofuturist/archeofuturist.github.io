Current uranium levels in uranium ore are so low that you actually need more fossil power to dig it up and enrich it than you get from reactor. Easy uranium deposits were depleted during cold war and now only few remain. Current uranium levels are around 0,2-0,3% while during cold war some uranium mines had 40% levels.

Mostly, nuclear isn&#039;t as efficient as thorium reactors and it is much more prolific at polluting the earth. That aside, how one goes about obtaining and then enriching uranium\/plutonium is another environmental problem altogether. To mine uranium, you inject the ground with a uranium solvent and then boil off the solvent to obtain the uranium ore (method commonly used in WY), unfortunately this has the unintended concequence of irrevocably polluting the water with solvent and uranium. If you mine uranium the old fashion way, where you dig the dirt up and then seperate out the ore, you are left with uranium &quot;trailing&quot; piles that find their way into the water supply. Apart from this, you can&#039;t &quot;turn off&quot; a reactor core once it starts up, it takes like 6 months to shut down a nuclear reactor. Then what does one do about the spent uranium rods?

Bring in the 10 commandments and now there is an innovative distinction between irsael and the surrounding nations. You shall not covet your neighbour&#039;s shit, you wont steal anything from anyone (their land, their life, their wife, their cattle, etc), and the introduction of 1 true God (1 god above al Gods, which eventuallly became monotheistic).<br><br>Now Christianity, which introduced a new universal law more descreatly: love your neighbour as yourself, and do unto others as you would have done unto you. Untill this point the concept universally was &quot;an eye for an eye&quot; and &quot;treat yourself great, treat your neighbor after yourself&quot;.<br>Check out matthew 5-7:28 to see the sermon on the mount.<br><br>Both christianity and Judaism introduced revolutionary concepts of morality that simply did not exist prior.

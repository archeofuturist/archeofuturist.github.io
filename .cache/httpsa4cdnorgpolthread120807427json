Even during the election, I just claimed that they were trolls from other boards. <br><br>I am now convinced that shills are real. Data agencies have information about which right-wing websites have the highest amount of traffic, and people like George Soros spend their money on shills to infiltrate these communities. <br><br>These shilling agencies have gotten much smarter. They&#039;ve figured out that they need to convince us that Trump is not a nationalist, but a neo-con. This is our worst political nightmare, and they have finally figured this out. Fake news has also figured this out, which is why we are seeing a million articles being pumped out saying that &quot;Trump has dropped his tax reform plan&quot; and &quot;Trump has decided not to build the wall&quot;. <br><br>Fake news has realized that calling us racist is not effective, but trying to turn us against Trump IS effective. Alex Jones actually said that they are trying to turn Trump&#039;s voter base against him so the globalists and neo-cons can take him over. <br><br>Don&#039;t believe the shills, and don&#039;t believe the fake news. This is a new tactic, and it is MUCH more effective than their old tactics.","filename":"17795790_441117196224245_1653403401700884832_n","ext":".jpg","w":486,"h":442,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":227,"tim":1492030565524,"time":1492030565,"md5":"KpEm+aCcn5du7nTfRq1p0w==","fsize":55979,"resto":0,"id":"rBxc0sfo","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"okay-shills-are-real","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":1,"unique_ips":1},{"no":120807861,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)16:59:10","name":"Anonymous","filename":"1484362351817","ext":".jpg","w":953,"h":772,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":101,"tim":1492030750593,"time":1492030750,"md5":"j+yvBgKgdbEuF6C5Q0KMyQ==","fsize":296569,"resto":120807427,"id":"rBxc0sfo","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

How often does fear approach with the creeping of the shadows...

It&#039;s crippling, it&#039;s not fun to have. Wanting to kill yourself is the most annoying feeling I could ever possibly describe. That being said I&#039;m a very religious person now and I see life as God&#039;s will and for me to kill myself would end any possible good I could possibly do in the future. If you understand that God allowed you to come into existence and if you know that he wants you to do good things within your existence then you should strive to do such at any point in your life. When you have no money, when you do have money, when you&#039;re homeless, when you have a mansion. You have the capacity to do good and make an impact anywhere on this planet because God allows you to. I believe that as fact but comment only with opinion. <br><br>Now relating to the first world bit, if you are in a position of wealth and or good capacity to give charity or some sort of good deeds then you should definitely do so at some point in your life. Good deeds are good deeds. You may or may not know the people you are kind towards but the actions are moral and there is a reason these interactions exist within our societies. Commit yourself to improving yourself and helping the people around your (family, friends, strangers) succeed in their life too. Your life has meaning because you are here on this planet. Solipsism is bullshit. Humanity was created with a purpose and we are will united with a spirituality that matches nothing else on the planet.

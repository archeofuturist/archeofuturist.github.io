Life is life&#039;s own goal they say; a wise sentiment I echo, and that even priests would do well to heed. But O how often does doubt assail these revellers of life! How often does fear approach with the creeping of the shadows... So great becomes the looming horror that death becomes larger than life and death becomes the greater force.<br><br>Forget the promise of gods I say, but defy the fear of oblivion as well, for only if life and death become each other&#039;s equals can the philosophy of death become one of life. Death is the instigator of faith and fear, but only if you let it be so. If you can gaze into its obsidian eyes, knowing it is the be all and the end all, but fear neither, then shall you have reached the shores of wisdom.<br><br>So sayeth Nemris.&quot;","time":1492233123,"resto":121169655,"id":"oG\/tzkD3","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":121173653,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)01:13:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121173551\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121173551<\/a><br>Dead people don&#039;t pay tithes, so those who off themselves go to hell.

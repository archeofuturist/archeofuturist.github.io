We know that the server is at least circumstantially connected rather closely to former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page, a Russian asset under FBI surveillance. And a fascinating new detail has emerged which has led me to a theory that I think is worth exploring.<br><br>Carter Page\u2019s business office is located at 590 Madison Avenue in Manhattan, and has been for some time. Yesterday, Seth Abramson pieced together that 590 Madison Avenue has a private connecting walkway to the adjacent Trump Tower (link). This means Page and Donald Trump had immediate access to each other, and to each other\u2019s offices, if they wanted it. And although it\u2019s always made logistical sense why Trump and his operation would have wanted a private server to communicate with Russian interests, it\u2019s always struck me as odd that even someone as brazen as Trump would do something as suspicious as putting this kind of server in his own building, where he lives, unless he had to.","time":1492182747,"resto":121069686,"id":"ySWxsY2+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121070898,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)11:13:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121070712\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121070712<\/a><br><br>Schiff&#039;s comment was old, pre new info, read again","time":1492182802,"resto":121069686,"id":"ySWxsY2+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121070971,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)11:13:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;will Donald Trump START A SECOND KOREAN WAR<\/span><br><br>You dumb cunt we&#039;re still in the first Korean war.

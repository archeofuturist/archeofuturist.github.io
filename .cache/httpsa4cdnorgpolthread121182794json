This means there is a cliff edge at Brexit with WTO terms applying until the FTA is negotiated and voted on and goes in effect, which can take years. <br><br>A much more sensible approach is this: the EU and UK negotiate the divorce agreement which is complicated enough and will take at least a year to negotiate. Then the UK takes some time to apply to EFTA to be a member there. On 1 Jan 2019, it exits the EU and becomes an EFTA member. Then the UK and EU can negotiate an FTA, something which will take several years. If the FTA talks fail, the UK can still stay in EFTA - if they succeed, the UK can choose between EFTA and the negotiated FTA. And if the UK is suicidal, it can also leave EFTA at any time without a negotiated FTA.","filename":"Screen Shot 2017-04-15 at 8.56.06 AM","ext":".png","w":2100,"h":1382,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":164,"tim":1492239621183,"time":1492239621,"md5":"xyao13lcVEoVmknG3Ink7g==","fsize":2487768,"resto":0,"id":"8MsAqNjP","country":"DE","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"i-have-said-it-for-a-long-time-a-transition-deal","country_name":"Germany","replies":8,"images":0,"unique_ips":8},{"no":121183366,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)03:08:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121182794\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121182794<\/a><br>No thanks.","time":1492240110,"resto":121182794,"id":"tsn7jeSN","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121183459,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)03:09:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121182794\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121182794<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Under EU law<\/span><br><br>Oh under EU law you say?

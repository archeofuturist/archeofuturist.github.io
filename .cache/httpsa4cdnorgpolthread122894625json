I&#039;m obviously not doing the normie, &quot;Refugees are good&quot; and &quot;they helped stop racism&quot; because they haven&#039;t. Which topic would be better for red-pilling (I have to speak to the class) and if you have any, do you have any accurate sources from online (or any other sources) that would help me with evidence to support my claim? Thanks.","filename":"download","ext":".png","w":259,"h":194,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1493220064685,"time":1493220064,"md5":"+v5WBHH+eDfMZHa9zWP7Eg==","fsize":7774,"resto":0,"id":"6gPcMHTQ","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"which-topic-would-be-more-redpilling","country_name":"United States","replies":6,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":122894801,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)11:22:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"i would advise doing the refuge one, Its easier and you can make an appeal to logic, also, what grade are you in?","time":1493220161,"resto":122894625,"id":"KNSJF2MW","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122894841,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)11:23:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122894625\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122894625<\/a><br>Jews.<br><br>Nobody can call themselves redpilled unless they know about the history and nature of the Jew.","time":1493220180,"resto":122894625,"id":"7JBouGva","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122895037,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)11:24:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122894801\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122894801<\/a><br>I&#039;m a highschool fag (11) and it&#039;s an honors class, so it should be good. <br><a href=\"#p122894841\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122894841<\/a><br>Lol that&#039;s not on the list of topics.","time":1493220294,"resto":122894625,"id":"6gPcMHTQ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122895643,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)11:30:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122895037\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122895037<\/a><br>yea, make sure you mention that ISIS has made official statements say that they use refugee populations to infiltrate the host country. You could also go into the economic strain accepting refugees would put on it. Another way to do it is that if the refugees&#039; culture is comparable with the host country, mention Sweden being the rape capital of europe, and that it was due to the fact that it accepted so many refugees. If you could follow-up on how it went I would love to hear how your class and most likely your teacher would respond to being red-pilled.","time":1493220613,"resto":122894625,"id":"KNSJF2MW","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122895719,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)11:30:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122895643\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122895643<\/a><br>Source?

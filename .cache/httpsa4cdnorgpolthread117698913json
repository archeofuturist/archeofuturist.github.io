I understand inflation but something about the whole system doesn&#039;t add up. I can live in 1950s America, put in 1 hour of labor to make 1 dollar and buy 5 gallons of gasoline with that 1 dollar right away. But if I hold on to that dollar, wait until 2000s, I can barely buy 1\/3 of a gallon of gasoline.<br><br>Now, I understand that there are factors to attend here, namely that gasoline is a limited resource and there may be a much higher supply\/demand in the 1950s, but what if we take something that should cost less over time, say clothing? If I lived in the 1700s, before the invention of the cotton gin, grew my own cotton, made a sweater out of it, I make a nice little profit. I could buy back that sweater right away. I should, in theory, hold on to my money, wait until there are more efficient ways to make clothing (due to technology - cotton gins, farming equipment, etc), and then use that spending power to buy 100 sweaters. But I can&#039;t. The purchasing power is still LESS! I think about what money is... it&#039;s supposed to be a means of trading wealth and value. We use fiat currency instead of a bartering system so that we can (1) efficiently trade one labor for another (it&#039;s more efficient to leave the farmers do the farming and for me to do whatever it is I specialize in), and (2) so we can hold onto this spending power so we can cash in the fruits of our labor at a later time. But the system we have breaks (2). <br><br>Where does this spending power go? Help!<br><br>My theory is that money is being printed into the system that devalues the money I won. Naturally, if I have $100 in a system that has $1m in circulation, and the gov&#039;t prints $10m, then my spending power goes down to almost a tenth of what it once was. But I don&#039;t know if this is actually the case.","filename":"money,time","ext":".jpg","w":1600,"h":1067,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1490145309716,"time":1490145309,"md5":"bONWlzSSx0taa+Kw\/OU7Gw==","fsize":951555,"resto":0,"id":"rDYwMAeZ","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"hi-pol-i-was-im-debating-with-a-friend-on","country_name":"United States","replies":10,"images":0,"unique_ips":5},{"no":117699182,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)21:17:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117698913\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117698913<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Why does purchasing power diminish over time?<\/span><br>Supply and demand.

Due to the nature of our money system, money is always losing worth.<br><br>This is because all USD are on loan from the federal reserve. It is loaned to banks, which use it to finance mortgages, investments, and various other bank activities. This is how it circulates to the public. (Via purchases with loaned money)<br><br>This means that every dollar in existence constantly requires a specific interest payment from some bank to the federal reserve. To pay this, they take out more loans from the federal reserve in new money.<br><br>Since the pile of money is constantly growing, it is becoming less and less scarce. Because the pile is growing faster than the economy using it grows, the currency deflates.<br><br>If we had natural value increases on the order of 5% then we wouldn&#039;t have inflation, because the banks would be able to pay more of their interest off of profits from investments (earned off of other parties) and loan out less money from the federal reserve.<br><br>TL;DR: The value of the dollar is mostly represented by:<br><br>(value of economy) \/ (total money)<br><br>Because the fed loans money out, total money is always increasing.

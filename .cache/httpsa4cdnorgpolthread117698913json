I understand inflation but something about the whole system doesn&#039;t add up. I can live in 1950s America, put in 1 hour of labor to make 1 dollar and buy 5 gallons of gasoline with that 1 dollar right away. But if I hold on to that dollar, wait until 2000s, I can barely buy 1\/3 of a gallon of gasoline.<br><br>Now, I understand that there are factors to attend here, namely that gasoline is a limited resource and there may be a much higher supply\/demand in the 1950s, but what if we take something that should cost less over time, say clothing? If I lived in the 1700s, before the invention of the cotton gin, grew my own cotton, made a sweater out of it, I make a nice little profit. I could buy back that sweater right away. I should, in theory, hold on to my money, wait until there are more efficient ways to make clothing (due to technology - cotton gins, farming equipment, etc), and then use that spending power to buy 100 sweaters. But I can&#039;t. The purchasing power is still LESS! I think about what money is... it&#039;s supposed to be a means of trading wealth and value. We use fiat currency instead of a bartering system so that we can (1) efficiently trade one labor for another (it&#039;s more efficient to leave the farmers do the farming and for me to do whatever it is I specialize in), and (2) so we can hold onto this spending power so we can cash in the fruits of our labor at a later time. But the system we have breaks (2). <br><br>Where does this spending power go? Help!<br><br>My theory is that money is being printed into the system that devalues the money I won. Naturally, if I have $100 in a system that has $1m in circulation, and the gov&#039;t prints $10m, then my spending power goes down to almost a tenth of what it once was. But I don&#039;t know if this is actually the case.","filename":"money,time","ext":".jpg","w":1600,"h":1067,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1490145309716,"time":1490145309,"md5":"bONWlzSSx0taa+Kw\/OU7Gw==","fsize":951555,"resto":0,"id":"rDYwMAeZ","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"hi-pol-i-was-im-debating-with-a-friend-on","country_name":"United States","replies":23,"images":0,"unique_ips":10},{"no":117699182,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)21:17:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117698913\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117698913<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Why does purchasing power diminish over time?<\/span><br>Supply and demand.

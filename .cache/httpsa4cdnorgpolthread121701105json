However, you really have to pick some best gems because many times some smaller regional cities, especially the squares look pretty much the same. But even then, Czech Republic still got some god tier nature around. The fact that it&#039;s kind of a eastern shithole in some aspects got some incredible perks, rapefugees avoid the country completely. People still have to try a little harder to make a living thus they don&#039;t have time to commit cultural suicide and so on. Girls are beautiful too, a lot of beautiful virgins even at 18,19,20. I always laugh at the cum-dumpsters from USA where people cry that they cant even find a girl that haven&#039;t rode a cock carousel. However the Uni age is probably cut off for virgins, after that it&#039;s just fucking around. Best bet is to find some girl from Gymnasium, at least that&#039;s what I did.","time":1492532759,"resto":121701105,"id":"LleYHxMT","country":"CZ","country_name":"Czech Republic"},{"no":121703187,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)12:26:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121701105\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121701105<\/a><br>Lots of porn and Scandinavians vacationing.","time":1492532774,"resto":121701105,"id":"BMQah0uK","country":"DK","country_name":"Denmark"},{"no":121703607,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)12:29:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121703068\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121703068<\/a><br><br>Prague was built by German Emperors during the time Bohemia was an integral part of the Holy Roman Empire and later Austria-Hungary..It&#039;s the only thing worth there.

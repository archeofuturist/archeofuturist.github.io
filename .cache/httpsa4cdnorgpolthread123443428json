Gender is a spectrum only for .3% of the population.<br><br>This 3% of the population have gender dysphoria. Gender dysphoria (transgenderism) is a rare egosyntonic mental health issue that is characterized by symptoms of depression, anxiety, suicidal thoughts, and body dysmorphia. The suicide rate of sufferers is 41%, compared to 2% of the general normal population. Current treatment for Gender dysphoria is psychiatric counseling coupled with reinforcing therapies which allow the sufferer to take on the appearance of the opposite sex, by taking hormones and making cosmetic changes up to and including cosmetic surgical procedures. <br><br>Psychiatric counseling is the foundation of treatment however, and sufferers must be clinically diagnosed by a psychiatrist before treatment can be prescribed. Psychiatric counseling takes place concurrently to &#039;transitioning&#039; to help the patient through the changes.<br>&#039;Transitioning&#039; helps patients short term by providing them some relief from their symptoms of depression, anxiety, suicidal thoughts and body dysmorphia. However, after transitioning, suicide rates climb back up to pre-transitioning levels and so transitioning is not effective long term.","filename":"transgender-chart","ext":".jpg","w":1003,"h":520,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":64,"tim":1493536899159,"time":1493536899,"md5":"hsf7uJWIL\/4pDEv3WT\/bYg==","fsize":159366,"resto":123443428,"id":"rzXR9cR7","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123451472,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)03:31:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123443428\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123443428<\/a><br> this is not science you are fake science.","time":1493537464,"resto":123443428,"id":"MmFs9mAX","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123451759,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)03:35:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123443428\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123443428<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Two-Spirit<\/span>","filename":"1477113251197","ext":".png","w":1145,"h":918,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":100,"tim":1493537700386,"time":1493537700,"md5":"Q4Y2Om2MLsxOFsUrrdvLkw==","fsize":390050,"resto":123443428,"id":"3t+J1xGz","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123452038,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)03:38:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123444816\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123444816<\/a><br>it&#039;s so fucking obvious that&#039;s going to happen it makes me think it&#039;s on purpose.<br><br>#WhenWhitesChimpOut","filename":"huge_nazi_rally_by_themistrunsred-d5b4peo","ext":".jpg","w":1032,"h":774,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1493537905706,"time":1493537905,"md5":"NtbkbA9cznbou\/oDqDC+qA==","fsize":155601,"resto":123443428,"id":"ofLmb+xT","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":123452440,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)03:45:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123443428\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123443428<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;science&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;<\/span>","time":1493538318,"resto":123443428,"id":"wETgUh+A","country":"CZ","country_name":"Czech Republic"},{"no":123453005,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)03:54:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;flick paint at a canvas<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;call it a graph<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;we STEAM now<\/span>","time":1493538842,"resto":123443428,"id":"UK5kUJDG","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123453245,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)03:57:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123443428\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123443428<\/a><br>Someone photo shop it to represent this data<a href=\"#p123450865\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123450865<\/a>","time":1493539076,"resto":123443428,"id":"xwrbVRcJ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123453419,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)04:00:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123443428\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123443428<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Biological Gender<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Spectrum<\/span><br><br><br>I&#039;m triggered.","filename":"0817_13bc_500","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":619,"tn_w":100,"tn_h":124,"tim":1493539227707,"time":1493539227,"md5":"wtvNlNJWQTnvGhmnI3yPQg==","fsize":43866,"resto":123443428,"id":"nWE14B3X","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":123453739,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)04:06:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123453245\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123453245<\/a><br><br>But all those little blobby colors would not be visible in that incredibly narrow .3% slice of pie","time":1493539570,"resto":123443428,"id":"rzXR9cR7","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123455325,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)04:27:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123443428\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123443428<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;neither<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;male<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;female<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;both<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;both is not in the middle of male and female<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;male and female are not separate dimensions with neither at the origin<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;random gradient colors representing nothing<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;forbidden regions will no explanation<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;clearly isolated regions undermining &quot;it&#039;s a spectrum&quot;<\/span><br><br>They can&#039;t even plot their fake data right.","time":1493540839,"resto":123443428,"id":"B0V0m6Qy","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

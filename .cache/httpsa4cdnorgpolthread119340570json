I was going to put #PrayForRussia as my facebook status, but I don&#039;t want to look like I am supporting Trump!

This is a really big pickle I&#039;m in because if I show that I&#039;m praying for Russia they might think that I am actually thanking them for our Child in Chief. If I show that I don&#039;t care about Russia then that makes me just like these mentally disturbed, unrelated to any specific religion, misunderstood people who are taking part in these bombings that are isolated cases. <br><br>What should I do \/pol\/!","filename":"stand with her","ext":".jpg","w":3500,"h":2298,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":164,"tim":1491233707073,"time":1491233707,"md5":"mNygx6+HjVA1KMcDFhX2mg==","fsize":1049866,"resto":0,"id":"aiJulB9o","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"pol-you-guys-have-to-help-me-i-dont-know-what-to","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

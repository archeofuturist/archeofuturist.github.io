It allows the banks to remove any risk of default, so they lend literally to anyone who can get it (pretty much everyone). Read:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Canada&#039;s entire housing market is subprime<\/span><br><br>Before the 2000s, the CMHC required 10% downpayments, 25 year terms and had limits of $500k I believe.<br><br>Harper then came to power in 2006 and the CMHC gradually reduced downpayments to 0% (banks were paying people to buy houses), upped amortizations to 40 years and removed the cap. There was talk of upping amortizations to 50 years etc.<br><br>The bubble kept building and the average house price in Canada has essentially tripled in a decade despite lower incomes, with some areas having gone from $150-200K to $1M+. The average home price (including condos\/apts\/cottages etc) is $520K. The average house price is closer to $1M. The first people into this ponzi scheme made money on paper and kept trading houses with each other, taking their magical &quot;home equity&quot; derived from rising prices with them, constantly inflating prices further.<br><br>The government has since reduced CMHC amortization to 25 years, introduced a $1M cap, and raised downpayments to 5% on the first $500K and 10% on the next $500K (ie. 7.5% on a 1M loan).<br><br>As a result, alternative lenders much like CountryWide have popped up and they primarily give out liar loans where people can lie about their income. Now these lenders (Home Capital Group, Equitable Bank, etc) are having runs on the bank, with home capitals shares collapsing 65% on Wednesday and equitable down 40-50%.

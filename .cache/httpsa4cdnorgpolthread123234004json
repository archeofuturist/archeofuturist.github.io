If you consume 2500 kcals of nuts, dried fruit, vegetables and baked lean meat, you will not get fat.","time":1493409615,"resto":123234004,"id":"SFdmxkv4","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123237349,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)16:00:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"MUMMY chickenshit May\u2019s refusal again today to protect the pensions guarantee shows that the Tories are abandoning older people.<br><br>Labour will maintain the pensions guarantee so that the elderly can go about their lives with dignity.<br><br><br>And joking aside why do you rabid Nazis hate this they paid for you to be born under the NHS you CUNTS ???","time":1493409621,"resto":123234004,"id":"ilCTCJYc","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123237443,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)16:01:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123237326\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123237326<\/a><br>What is it with niggers always saying &quot;baka&quot; on social media.<br><br>Never see whites doing the same.","time":1493409665,"resto":123234004,"id":"JbU2xZGz","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123237455,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)16:01:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123236787\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123236787<\/a><br>Tell all.","time":1493409670,"resto":123234004,"id":"PhikQELM","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123237466,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)16:01:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123237078\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123237078<\/a><br>HOL&#039; UP","time":1493409676,"resto":123234004,"id":"FlkJE2yg","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123237500,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)16:01:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123235040\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123235040<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Actually, it weren&#039;t a light it were a light switch<\/span>","filename":"image","ext":".jpg","w":480,"h":318,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":82,"tim":1493409691230,"time":1493409691,"md5":"XAK1HfzsqGZhfI5gXr+kjQ==","fsize":26542,"resto":123234004,"id":"0xBqUuhb","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123237573,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)16:02:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123237234\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123237234<\/a><br>and i&#039;m a plumber with 5 gcses, you know his type goes for me you&#039;re fucked","time":1493409737,"resto":123234004,"id":"iDStLv6e","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123237614,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)16:02:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"I remember the thread, none of us expected the paki to be alright<br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=5gS<wbr>rgandHXY","time":1493409762,"resto":123234004,"id":"CTd9JBgG","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123237691,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)16:03:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123237573\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123237573<\/a><br>you&#039;re right tbf","filename":"IMG_0649","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":589,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":122,"tim":1493409799284,"time":1493409799,"md5":"0c3wnO\/U+hfFgbDjRNuUkg==","fsize":59394,"resto":123234004,"id":"JbU2xZGz","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123237707,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)16:03:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123237177\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123237177<\/a><br>I&#039;ve been thinking we needed are own rebel media type thing for a while now.

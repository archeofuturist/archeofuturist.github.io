They like being the guys who can whine and cry about EBUL DEMONRATS to rally up their base, then threaten government shutdown all so they can put on an act that they&#039;re fighting and doing things without actually doing a damn thing; they don&#039;t actually want to be in the driver&#039;s seat because they don&#039;t want to actually have to do shit.

That won&#039;t be the case at all and I think if things go back to the status quo in 2018\/2020 you&#039;re going to see a large public disengagement from politics and voting. Blue collar whites aren&#039;t going to want to vote for a party running the 30+ year old culture war playbook of appealing to evangelicals.

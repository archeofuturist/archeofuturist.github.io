Trump would have preferred working with Russia for obvious reasons and could have leveraged the benefits of working with him against China and confront China in some form. The media spoiled that plan so now the aim is to use China to undermine Russia&#039;s global interests. <br><br>The strike on Syria was used as a means of showing that Trump isn&#039;t afraid of using military force and to get rid of the Russian puppet notion so he can actually progress in improving relations. <br><br>Break free from conditioning, any opinion you see in the media is absolute hogwash and you should extract merely the events and derive the likeliest motivations. Since the election I read one good commentary of Kissinger inspired opening foreign policy moves and it appears as though that is the direction we are moving except instead of befriending Russia we are befriending China.","time":1493783661,"resto":123848477,"id":"sy\/SUPGS","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123867816,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)23:55:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123866742\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123866742<\/a><br>who gives a fuck??? instead of converting it to pesos and back to dollars, we keep it denominated in dollars, thereby saving conversion fees, loss of value due to the peso being shit, etc.","time":1493783718,"resto":123848477,"id":"Kajhn4qq","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123867869,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)23:55:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123866742\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123866742<\/a><br>Well then, we will have an exception for peoplethat are citizens or here on legal visas but guess what? all those fucking mexicans that are illegal? they send the most money and they are going to pay, and if we cant do exeptions then it is a voluntary tax because guess what?they dont have to send the money in the first place. they could spend it here..","time":1493783748,"resto":123848477,"id":"9S9uKq3b","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123867950,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)23:56:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123866033\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123866033<\/a><br>kek","time":1493783803,"resto":123848477,"id":"5NAlkprX","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":123868268,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)23:59:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123867869\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123867869<\/a><br>do you make every statement a question like that in real life? it must be fucking torture talking to you kid<br><br><a href=\"#p123867816\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123867816<\/a><br>why would it be converted to pesos and back to dollars? people working here are sending money to their families to spend in their home countries. they aren&#039;t buying US goods with the remittance payments.","time":1493783974,"resto":123848477,"id":"lK6fOT4C","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123868576,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)00:02:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123868268\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123868268<\/a><br>I guess so but how do I change it?","time":1493784148,"resto":123848477,"id":"9S9uKq3b","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123868763,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)00:04:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123849200\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123849200<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;be trump<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;hire steve bannon<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;win election<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;make him your chief strategist<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;libs and media never stop freaking out<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;finally get sick of it<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;fake demote bannon<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;libshits eat it up<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;still winning<\/span>","time":1493784254,"resto":123848477,"id":"KudHQSo3","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123868868,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)00:05:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123866172\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123866172<\/a><br>Yeah, I&#039;m thinking what&#039;s behind his shoulder is &quot;Executive Orders.&quot; Probably.

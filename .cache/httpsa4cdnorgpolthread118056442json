Sowell, the argument isn&#039;t that you should get what someone else has worked for.

The whole point of taxation is that we all pay, but that we make poorer people pay less since they have less of a surplus from which we can tax. The richer people also benefit more, since them having better educated smarter employees gives them more money. Them having access to better roads saves them money transporting this stuff, etc.<br><br>It&#039;s about lifting some necessary spending OUT of the private sector, and then let the private sector do its thing.<br><br>Since public spending is necessary, it makes sense to talk about a &quot;fair share&quot;.

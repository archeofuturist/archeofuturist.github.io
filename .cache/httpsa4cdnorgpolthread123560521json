It&#039;s not even 4D Chess, it&#039;s the same type of bullshit that&#039;s in art of the deal to be honest. The beauty of it is that Xi probably knows exactly what Trump is up to, but he doesn&#039;t want a mistake in his back yard and then he&#039;s got the whole world asking them to stop WWIII because they are tight with NK. The result is heavier sanctions.","filename":"IMG_3584","ext":".jpg","w":92,"h":129,"tn_w":92,"tn_h":129,"tim":1493603475777,"time":1493603475,"md5":"ACcskZ9Yk9DmZxZ1rj5ltg==","fsize":5137,"resto":0,"id":"qtHQg+qn","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"whats-the-deal-guys","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

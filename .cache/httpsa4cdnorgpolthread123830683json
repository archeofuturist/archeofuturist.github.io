Boomers are the first of the &quot;progressive movements&quot;, they were the hippies, they wanted to normalize homosexuality, they were the first to want all sorts of free shit, they idolized people like MLK, etc.. They are heathens. Boomers are why America is importing non-white third-worlders like crazy.","filename":"supermarket 1964","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":1000,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":97,"tim":1493770012686,"time":1493770012,"md5":"BLXP4f5j73rx27bIeMwmfw==","fsize":449962,"resto":123830683,"id":"SLDj2RJ0","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":123841694,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)20:07:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123840993\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123840993<\/a><br>Are you me?","filename":"1458478094598","ext":".jpg","w":668,"h":712,"tn_w":117,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493770027367,"time":1493770027,"md5":"gf\/7h6esuFwaRdfREPtl5A==","fsize":118919,"resto":123830683,"id":"OnktyNT\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123841706,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)20:07:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123831068\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123831068<\/a><br>Maybe we wouldn&#039;t be broke if it what we earned wasn&#039;t pissed away on social security for a generation that didn&#039;t bother to plan for the retirement they think they&#039;re entitled to.<br>Maybe if the job market wasn&#039;t so overcrowded because of the minority-exclusive welfare programs, unionized cronyism, and minimum-wage laws you passed we&#039;d be able to stay competitive.<br>Maybe if the stock market was a safe investment instead of the gamble your support of the federal reserve turned it into.","time":1493770034,"resto":123830683,"id":"p+HFtoW9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123841770,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)20:07:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123841510\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123841510<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;baby boomer<\/span><br>born 1946 - 1964","time":1493770060,"resto":123830683,"id":"epN3+Rqg","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123841773,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)20:07:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123840733\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123840733<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Are most of the uni courses for paramedicine as bad as the one you&#039;re describing?<\/span><br>No, mine is particularly bad however i&#039;d say overall our university style training is an awful step away from the old style both in terms of how they treat us and the quality of training we get.<br><br>The aussie thing is just becuase of shortages really, Australia has similar standards to us and London is desperate for anyone they even scrapped their fitness tests.","time":1493770063,"resto":123830683,"id":"rdc5WAXh","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123841807,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)20:07:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123841341\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123841341<\/a><br>yeah they set up a welfare program that only applies to them and then retired right around the time NAFTA became a thing how fucking brilliant are they","time":1493770077,"resto":123830683,"id":"jmuEDHXY","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123841839,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)20:08:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123837458\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123837458<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;i should be grateful to whipe asses for free<\/span><br>I mean if you&#039;re into dom stuff you kinda should be","time":1493770091,"resto":123830683,"id":"w3DaF1B5","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123841871,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)20:08:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123841341\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123841341<\/a><br>Nice.<br><br>You&#039;re such a successful consumer.

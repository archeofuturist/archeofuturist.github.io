This crippled the Roman empire because the Roman citizens began to see through the corruption of state power, so they quickly adopted the individualistic ethic of Christianity. The theological shift of Europe toward atheism in recent decades has let the citizens begin comfort in state power once more, leading to increased faith in a single European project. This tends to occur around periods of philosophical turmoil (e.g. democracy, problems emerging in monarchy and the church, the Reformation, etc.)<br><br>The end game of the current culture war that we see before us is actually beginning to take shape as the question of modern technology is settling at an exponential rate (the current discussions about the risks of technology are such things as virtual reality and genetic engineering, for example). All that remains to be seen is how lasting the atheistic movement is. If the West brings forward either 1. A Christian revival or 2. A new ethic which maintains the individual burden of the individual arises out of the death of God in living man&#039;s mind, then we can expect relative stability over the forseeable historical future (100 years? Probably less.) <br><br>Both of these events seem doubtful, unfortunately.","filename":"blocks path","ext":".jpg","w":981,"h":819,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":208,"tim":1493844891814,"time":1493844891,"md5":"SJLFqSH49xBogzpRvvDgpw==","fsize":185645,"resto":0,"id":"j1bLyfgA","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"check-em","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":123964460,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)17:09:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123962355\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123962355<\/a><br>It&#039;s too late to save the West.<br>It&#039;s time to destroy the west and rebuilt from the ground up<br><br>Nothing works in the west<br>The legal system is fucked<br>The education system is fucked<br>The employment system is fucked<br>The family unit is fucked<br>Western morality is fucked<br><br>The sooner the west collapses the better","time":1493845741,"resto":123962355,"id":"dc07hRHp","country":"IN","country_name":"India"},{"no":123965185,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)17:14:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123962355\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123962355<\/a><br><br>I agree. Western society is doomed and the systematic abolition of Christianity is the main cause of it. At this point I can&#039;t even be mad that Islam will take over the world. It&#039;s the stronger religion and its believers believe much more firmly than any other religion. Shared faith is power and Islam has the most of it. <br><br>It&#039;s just natural selection. Let&#039;s just hope that once Islam has truly taken over the entire world and all wars ended we can continue our path towards the stars.<br><br>I would have hoped that our future starfaring human empire that rules the Galaxy would be christian but it is a dying religion.

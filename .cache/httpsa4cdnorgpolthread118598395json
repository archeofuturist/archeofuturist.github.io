The thing is, I wouldn&#039;t mind picking up another item or two that makes a statement about free speech. I understand that wearing or displaying swastikas is not illegal in america, but it is somewhat drastic. Idk if there&#039;s a good way for y&#039;all to answer without shilling, but I guess I&#039;m curious if you guys have any bright ideas.","filename":"beard_1","ext":".jpg","w":721,"h":480,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1490667903159,"time":1490667903,"md5":"mtoIfRyu7xrdssNiATdB2A==","fsize":91707,"resto":0,"id":"9VDv6R\/n","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"free-speech-memorabilia","country_name":"United States","replies":4,"images":1,"unique_ips":3},{"no":118598525,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)22:26:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"Go hard or go home.","time":1490667979,"resto":118598395,"id":"BmZnMHAP","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118599328,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)22:33:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"This is sad, so I&#039;ma give you an honest answer. I bought a Jean Vest and in the process of buying patches for it. But not like fucking Metallica and Nirvana, basic metal shit. Shit that has meaning. For example, I got a back patch of &quot;The Raft of Medusa&quot; it means something to me, and it&#039;s a message it sends a message, which is hope.

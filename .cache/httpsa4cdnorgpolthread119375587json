Very short, a few pages long.<br><br>Man and his Symbols is pretty good but I like Modern Man in Search of a Soul.","time":1491254670,"resto":119375587,"id":"5PnKOwDm","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":119382863,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)17:25:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119380089\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119380089<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;the Slow Death<\/span><br>this is me<br><br><a href=\"#p119381110\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119381110<\/a><br>this is me too","time":1491254708,"resto":119375587,"id":"KtlB5Bp3","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119383019,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)17:26:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119382780\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119382780<\/a><br>I&#039;ll look them up.

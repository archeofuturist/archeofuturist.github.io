By shifting male efforts from seeking wives to paternal investment, normative monogamy increases savings, child investment and economic productivity. By increasing the relatedness within households, normative monogamy reduces intra-household conflict, leading to lower rates of child neglect, abuse, accidental death and homicide.

Spencer, 1982), and the McMaster Family Assessment Device (FAD; N. B. Epstein, M. N. Baldwin, &amp; D. S. Bishop, 1983). The respondents from polygamous families had lower SE scores, statistically significant higher scores in 2 BSI dimensions, higher scores in all other BSI dimensions, and higher levels of self-reported family dysfunction. The respondents from polygamous families reported lower levels of socioeconomic status, academic achievement, and parental academic attainment. Those variables may have had a more direct impact on mental health than did parental marital status. The data also indicated that perceived family functioning was the best predictor of mental health.<\/span><br><br>Polygamy is associated with being poor and having shit self esteem.","time":1493078362,"resto":122656363,"id":"8cPa+iwX","country":"US","trip":"!Sempai.oWA","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122659943,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)19:59:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122659700\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122659700<\/a><br>Joe rogan isnt an intellectual, he is an MMA commentator who is curious about a lot of things but isnt nearly smart enough to figure everything out for himself.

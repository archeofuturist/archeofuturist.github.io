Basically, I discovered conservatism and right-wing not so long ago, having grown up as a moderate liberal. I have changed a lot of my viewpoints now, but theres one problem: I just don&#039;t believe in god. My family wasn&#039;t very religious, and neither am I.<br>I&#039;d become religious it if only to become less liberal. I understand that Christianity is a pillar that holds the West together, I agree with its morals, and I don&#039;t really have problems with other people&#039;s beliefs. <br>But speaking for myself, I simply never believed, and frankly don&#039;t want to. I would feel like a total faker, a hypocrite and a black sheep among people going to a church or wearing a cross. Not to mention, I don&#039;t really have much faith in orthodox church, which is still recovering from having been banned from people for 70 years and is limited to Russia and a few other slav countries only. A lot of people think of religious people as nuts, too, especially young people.<br>So what should I do, really? It feels like a no win situation.","filename":"130706miles","ext":".jpg","w":328,"h":284,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":216,"tim":1493858845529,"time":1493858845,"md5":"9j5OG4vQuFVlZemFWYeDbg==","fsize":89230,"resto":0,"id":"FegpurvG","country":"RU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"hey-pol-i-want-to-ask-you-for-advice-basically-i","country_name":"Russian Federation","replies":71,"images":13,"unique_ips":39},{"no":123993244,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)20:52:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123992715\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123992715<\/a><br>All you need to know is that KEK is the only true way of our people","filename":"IMG_0596","ext":".jpg","w":1124,"h":1136,"tn_w":123,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493859141384,"time":1493859141,"md5":"3yMUQws\/gEsl3pFGAvG00w==","fsize":445857,"resto":123992715,"id":"VURDSC5z","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":123993823,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)20:57:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"I don&#039;t recall anyone ever saying you had to believe in the Christian God in order to be a conservative.","time":1493859437,"resto":123992715,"id":"EHrDa9iT","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123994114,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)20:59:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123993823\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123993823<\/a><br>Umm, don&#039;t the American conservatives simply dismiss you if you&#039;re not religious?","time":1493859599,"resto":123992715,"id":"FegpurvG","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":123994329,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)21:01:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123993244\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123993244<\/a><br>No offense, but Kek has created as much philosophy, culture and traditions as a small black tribe.","time":1493859712,"resto":123992715,"id":"FegpurvG","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":123994349,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)21:02:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123994114\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123994114<\/a><br>i&#039;m conservative and not religious.","time":1493859721,"resto":123992715,"id":"GtN561qO","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123994379,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)21:02:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123994114\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123994114<\/a><br>some would but not most.","time":1493859741,"resto":123992715,"id":"RHFkmmgV","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123994508,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)21:03:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"When God is ready to come into your life, you will not be able to stop Him.

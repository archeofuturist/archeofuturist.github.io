Basically, I discovered conservatism and right-wing not so long ago, having grown up as a moderate liberal. I have changed a lot of my viewpoints now, but theres one problem: I just don&#039;t believe in god. My family wasn&#039;t very religious, and neither am I.<br>I&#039;d become religious it if only to become less liberal. I understand that Christianity is a pillar that holds the West together, I agree with its morals, and I don&#039;t really have problems with other people&#039;s beliefs. <br>But speaking for myself, I simply never believed, and frankly don&#039;t want to. I would feel like a total faker, a hypocrite and a black sheep among people going to a church or wearing a cross. Not to mention, I don&#039;t really have much faith in orthodox church, which is still recovering from having been banned from people for 70 years and is limited to Russia and a few other slav countries only. A lot of people think of religious people as nuts, too, especially young people.<br>So what should I do, really? It feels like a no win situation.","filename":"130706miles","ext":".jpg","w":328,"h":284,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":216,"tim":1493858845529,"time":1493858845,"md5":"9j5OG4vQuFVlZemFWYeDbg==","fsize":89230,"resto":0,"id":"FegpurvG","country":"RU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"hey-pol-i-want-to-ask-you-for-advice-basically-i","country_name":"Russian Federation","replies":42,"images":6,"unique_ips":26},{"no":123993244,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)20:52:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123992715\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123992715<\/a><br>All you need to know is that KEK is the only true way of our people","filename":"IMG_0596","ext":".jpg","w":1124,"h":1136,"tn_w":123,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493859141384,"time":1493859141,"md5":"3yMUQws\/gEsl3pFGAvG00w==","fsize":445857,"resto":123992715,"id":"VURDSC5z","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":123993823,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)20:57:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"I don&#039;t recall anyone ever saying you had to believe in the Christian God in order to be a conservative.","time":1493859437,"resto":123992715,"id":"EHrDa9iT","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123994114,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)20:59:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123993823\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123993823<\/a><br>Umm, don&#039;t the American conservatives simply dismiss you if you&#039;re not religious?","time":1493859599,"resto":123992715,"id":"FegpurvG","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":123994329,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)21:01:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123993244\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123993244<\/a><br>No offense, but Kek has created as much philosophy, culture and traditions as a small black tribe.","time":1493859712,"resto":123992715,"id":"FegpurvG","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":123994349,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)21:02:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123994114\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123994114<\/a><br>i&#039;m conservative and not religious.","time":1493859721,"resto":123992715,"id":"GtN561qO","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123994379,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)21:02:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123994114\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123994114<\/a><br>some would but not most.","time":1493859741,"resto":123992715,"id":"RHFkmmgV","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123994508,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)21:03:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"When God is ready to come into your life, you will not be able to stop Him.

I just feel there are 2 main &quot;camps&quot; of people today in Russia:<br>\u2014rednecky hard-on &quot;patriot&quot; types, with lots of drinkin&#039;, smokin&#039; and good ol&#039; chanson;<br>\u2014and centrist-liberal types. <br>The first has too much degeneracy in it, and commie sympathy. The second falls for new left meme.<br><br>There&#039;s just no easy way I see to be truly conservative and rigth-wing\u2026 And to not stand out and look out of place.","time":1493863381,"resto":123992715,"id":"FegpurvG","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":124001762,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)22:03:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123997270\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123997270<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;creation of the universe<\/span><br>perhaps the intial premise is the problem perhaps it was never created- no beginning, no end","time":1493863437,"resto":123992715,"id":"gCsTfZIC","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":124002072,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)22:06:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123994329\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123994329<\/a><br>I like you.","filename":"images (43)","ext":".jpg","w":225,"h":225,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493863603072,"time":1493863603,"md5":"UWO68zfLlSKjd5Rfl8JQsA==","fsize":8962,"resto":123992715,"id":"l4F55nnT","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":124002197,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)22:07:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124000039\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124000039<\/a><br>It&#039;s a long story really, you need to know quantum physics to understand it all and you can&#039;t boil it down to 5 minutes (unless you watch some youtube video that does it better than me).

Those will give you great insight into the spirit of what Christianity is all about. <br><br>After those, Acts is a great one as well. I would suggest leaving John for later, as it is much more philosophical at heart, and will be more of a struggle to truly comprehend. <br><br>As for the old testament, it&#039;s all important, but the first 5 books are key to understanding the fall of man, and our way to making amends with God, via Christ out Lord. <br><br>Try to find a bible with good footnotes for translations and references to other scripture. I don&#039;t know a good Russian bible to recommend, but the New American Standard is pretty good, as well as the Jerusalem Scholors Bible. I&#039;d stay away from the King James as it isn&#039;t a very good translation. It&#039;s good in the sense of style though, and it is much more fun to read.<br><br>Hope this helps!","time":1493864044,"resto":123992715,"id":"mpsC9PWR","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

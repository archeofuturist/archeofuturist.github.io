However, would that not include allowing women to get abortions and degenerates to do drugs if they want? How can someone really claim to be in favor of a small government that stays out of people&#039;s lives if they also believe that people don&#039;t have inherent right to make their own decisions about their bodies? How is it The Nanny State when liberals do things like outlaw 32 oz sodas from gas stations or institute smoking bans, but not The Nanny State when harsh drug laws are passed?

However, I wouldn&#039;t give socialism any of the credit for the rise of the middle class. For one, it started long before Marx&#039;s grandmother was a twinkle in satan&#039;s eye. It began with the protestant reformation. <br><br>Wait, wait, put that fedora down, let&#039;s talk this through. You see, the protestant reformation was the start of something a lot bigger than ten decades of murdering germans. It was the first time the common man looked up and saw noone, no kings, no priests, no popes, between them and god. Now, there is no more disquieting feeling than suddenly realizing that you alone are responsible for your own behavior. This sense of disquiet drove the mentally liberated peasants into a frenzy of activity, for once aimed not at enriching feudal lords or bishops, but bettering themselves. After all, no man wants to stand before god having done nothing of note, especially when their&#039;s no Saints, no Madonna nearby to pick up your slack. Before being proud of your faith became gauche, this industry driven by profound existential terror was known as the protestant work ethic. And it was this ethic which drove the middle class in europe to swell. With wealth came a need for education. Education broadened the scope of a man&#039;s aim, the world saw a rebirth of science and art lost since the fall of Rome. The Renaissance. During this upheaval, one particularly neurotic bunch of protestants managed to piss off their neighbors so bad they had to flee to the new world to satisfy their autistic compulsions. The rest, as they say, is geography.","time":1491172393,"resto":119252061,"id":"k1my0S9Q","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119257039,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)18:46:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119253741\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119253741<\/a><br><a href=\"#p119254839\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119254839<\/a><br>As always there is no response.<br><br>This is how you deal with retarded commie talking points.<br>Follow the money.

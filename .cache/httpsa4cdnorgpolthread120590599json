Replying to those threads without putting &quot;sage&quot; (without quotation marks) in the options field bumps those threads to the top and lets good topics slide, therefore undermining the real discussion and real investigations going on. Please do not participate in helping paid shills and normies making it harder for everyone to keep track of good topics.","filename":"43411_shill_alert_op4w","ext":".jpg","w":402,"h":402,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":249,"tim":1491913014021,"time":1491913014,"md5":"Dh87\/p3505vRwuCtbPQUAg==","fsize":79187,"resto":0,"id":"3fP\/uzyw","country":"DE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"daily-reminder-that-pol-is-compromised","country_name":"Germany","replies":17,"images":7,"unique_ips":10},{"no":120590635,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)08:17:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"If you have been here longer please contribute by reminding new posters of this and posting infos on shill and slide strategies, as well as not giving in and leaving for other boards.<br><br><br>DAILY REMINDER THAT PEOPLE ACTUALLY EARN MONEY BY INFLUENCING SHITPOSTER LIKE YOU ON \/POL\/<br><br>-&gt; https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Share<wbr>blue<br>-&gt; https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Media<wbr>_Matters_for_America<br>-&gt; https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Jewis<wbr>h_Internet_Defense_Force<br>-&gt; https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Corre<wbr>ct_the_Record<br>-&gt; https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Citiz<wbr>ens_for_Responsibility_and_Ethics_i<wbr>n_Washington<br><br>DIFFERENT TYPES OF SHILLING EXPLAINED AND HOW IT IS A REAL DANGER<br><br>-&gt; https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=sS9<wbr>olPA2BK0<br><br>EDUCATE YOURSELVES<br>EDUCATE OTHERS","filename":"1490685697517","ext":".png","w":1156,"h":2031,"tn_w":71,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491913038008,"time":1491913038,"md5":"uPwJAqzT86jiDTKQ2FKZbw==","fsize":280810,"resto":120590599,"id":"3fP\/uzyw","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":120590674,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)08:17:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"how many<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;WW3 NOW<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;ITS ABSOLUTELY HAPPENING<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;how can white males compete?<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;drumpf btfo<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;is weed redpilled?<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;niggers have no cult... oh.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;is \/pol\/ satire?<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;tfw no white gf, why live<\/span><br>etc.<br><br>threads have there been today?<br>I guess you can&#039;t even count them.","filename":"1490861097131","ext":".jpg","w":410,"h":1024,"tn_w":50,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491913062315,"time":1491913062,"md5":"L6knzC+VuRfyUljDUCdqYg==","fsize":65873,"resto":120590599,"id":"3fP\/uzyw","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":120590710,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)08:18:03","name":"Anonymous","filename":"1490864921803","ext":".jpg","w":2182,"h":1635,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1491913083083,"time":1491913083,"md5":"xF99ELW96IPHd2Vy\/jeEDA==","fsize":845802,"resto":120590599,"id":"3fP\/uzyw","country":"DE","m_img":1,"country_name":"Germany"},{"no":120590744,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)08:18:23","name":"Anonymous","filename":"1490864970753","ext":".jpg","w":2182,"h":1635,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1491913103672,"time":1491913103,"md5":"lcFeUTE18RdMjBVfJeInjQ==","fsize":820119,"resto":120590599,"id":"3fP\/uzyw","country":"DE","m_img":1,"country_name":"Germany"},{"no":120591067,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)08:22:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"Bump.<br>This is real information that everyone who posts on \/pol\/ needs to read and memorize.","time":1491913320,"resto":120590599,"id":"xo8CtiM9","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":120591173,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)08:23:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120590599\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120590599<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;doing dog&#039;s work<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;witnessed<\/span>","time":1491913384,"resto":120590599,"id":"Q0VaL\/qb","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":120593789,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)08:50:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120591173\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120591173<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;americans are waking up<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;shilling intensifies heavily<\/span>","filename":"1489591297532","ext":".png","w":477,"h":358,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1491915003953,"time":1491915003,"md5":"fgTKE6PeJaDJcYUCVBsKaA==","fsize":258151,"resto":120590599,"id":"3fP\/uzyw","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":120594105,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)08:53:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"This needs to be THE thread of the day.

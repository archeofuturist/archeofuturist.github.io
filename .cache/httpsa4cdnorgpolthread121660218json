The media is aghast about how much of a disaster it is but from what I can gather poor people, as well as Kurdish people so not just ethnic Turks voted for it. They must have had very good reasons for it I&#039;m not hearing about.","filename":"TurkeyFlag4","ext":".jpg","w":555,"h":370,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1492506101638,"time":1492506101,"md5":"0X7l1uguEM8TSL6\/2byjIQ==","fsize":9102,"resto":0,"id":"FPDkF6sR","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"why-did-people-vote-to-give-erdogan-more-powers","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":4,"images":1,"unique_ips":5},{"no":121661899,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)05:23:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121660218\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121660218<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The media is aghast about how much of a disaster it is<\/span><br><br>No. Erdogan has his tentacles all over the media. Even the alternative media is bluepilled, just telling the truth to an extend. Erdogan spend a fuck ton of resources on propoganda campaigns. That were really about feelz before realz( not telling anything about the changes)<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Kurdish people voted for it. <\/span><br><br>Again, wrong. Almost all of the kurds voted no. Where did you get that information?<br><br>Let&#039;s drop the &#039;religious muslim shitskins are idiot and cant think for themselves&#039; meme. Almost %90 of humanity cant think for themselves. We should look for the details.<br><br>1. Poor people are also the least educated and most effected from propaganda. Even the people left jobless because of erdogan voted for yes. Sad but true.<br>2. Rich people depend for their good fortune on the Erdogan. Look up the companies he fucked.<br>3. There is a vast amount of educated people who voted for yes. Because some people( no matter how much they know about science history philosophy) are just unconscious and can&#039;t think for themselves. Easily manipulated through media, family, religion, etc.","time":1492507434,"resto":121660218,"id":"I3WSveu7","country":"TR","country_name":"Turkey"},{"no":121662141,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)05:27:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121660218\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121660218<\/a><br>Leverage for future dealings with the EU, EU will accept more refugges thanks to Israel","time":1492507623,"resto":121660218,"id":"Z1fVausI","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121662221,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)05:28:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121660218\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121660218<\/a><br>just more proof if you needed any that shitskins are incompatible with us","time":1492507695,"resto":121660218,"id":"ZLWIKfRE","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":121662333,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)05:29:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121660218\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121660218<\/a><br>Propaganda works best on stupid people.","filename":"Capture","ext":".png","w":353,"h":94,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":33,"tim":1492507773130,"time":1492507773,"md5":"T1ZYrpRMuRZj3\/x6WYCGOQ==","fsize":4932,"resto":121660218,"id":"1Swu0Bxr","country":"FR","country_name":"France"}]}

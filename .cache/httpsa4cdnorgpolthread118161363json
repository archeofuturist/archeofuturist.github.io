Fucking retards don&#039;t understand that societal collapse is immediately followed by order, whether spontaneous or externally imposed. <br><br>Every goddamn thread there are people crying about how you should buy guns and food. Obviously if you don&#039;t have any of the basic survival necessities, those must be addressed first. But unless the person in question is a total poorfag, he&#039;ll already have that shit. Bullion and coins are what saves you once the economy kicks into gear again, and that comes pretty quick after the most violent and savage people kill each other off and the civilized people start rebuilding.","time":1490408849,"resto":118161363,"id":"XID+dyXt","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118172734,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)22:27:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118171279\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118171279<\/a><br>Filters are great, but I&#039;d recommend having several methods on hand depending on type of contamination or if your filter breaks. <br><br>A homemade gravel \/sand\/charcoal filter won&#039;t work as good as your professional filter, but it should clear up murky water enough so that it will be safe to drink once boiled. <br><br>A means to distill water will deal with any contamination, although you&#039;ll want to add some minerals back in so that you&#039;re not consuming straight distilled water. <br><br>Small quantities of bleach can be used to purify water.

Interest rates are rising into a weak economy and Trump wants to double the national debt again. The last time there were interest rates rising in a weak economy, the economy crashed and the USD inflated. This upcoming recession could be worse than even the Great Depression. <br><br>How should I prep for this? I really think bad things are on the horizon before the end of Trump&#039;s 4 years. I do plan on silver stacking, but I don&#039;t have much money in the first place to buy silver with (only around $7000) and I need to spend that money on other things like a car and rent.","filename":"Gold-and-Silver-Bullion-39778255[1]","ext":".jpg","w":1060,"h":795,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1490403318896,"time":1490403318,"md5":"\/nYc+4ffkgqapSGz8SsMgQ==","fsize":241297,"resto":0,"id":"tBplwXCQ","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"prepping-for-inflation-end-of-usd","country_name":"United States","replies":10,"images":3,"unique_ips":9},{"no":118161657,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)20:57:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"Just remember to prep the bull and everything will be OK.","filename":"IMG_0844","ext":".jpg","w":300,"h":274,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":114,"tim":1490403458431,"time":1490403458,"md5":"X3zKjw6saGH6KaZxY4KAGQ==","fsize":57993,"resto":118161363,"id":"t\/VA7UTp","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":118161958,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)21:00:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118161363\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118161363<\/a><br><br>Stop consuming so much.","time":1490403611,"resto":118161363,"id":"UMo5NOq+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118162205,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)21:02:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118161363\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118161363<\/a><br>Just bought an ounce of silver today.","time":1490403737,"resto":118161363,"id":"fxABAusu","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118162494,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)21:05:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118162205\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118162205<\/a><br>Just one?

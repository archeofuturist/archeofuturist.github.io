The Americans and Chinese have already agreed to a plan of action when this happens.<br>American forces will use the full brunt of its airforce to strategically bomb the fuck out of North Korea. South Korea will be tasked with holding, but not advancing across the 38th parallel. China will advance from the North (they&#039;re already piling troops at the border) and take North Korea by land. They will then meet the South Korean forces at the 38th parallel, and China will receive a very large new province for its trouble and cooperation, and make the whole thing worth their while. This will also lead to a new and better relationship with China and America.<br>Mark my words, and screencap this.","filename":"1479656489629","ext":".png","w":800,"h":800,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493139806993,"time":1493139806,"md5":"L9HGT0idUvq0Nd7KQp\/Ahw==","fsize":611049,"resto":0,"id":"rsw7XK4u","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"heres-how-the-north-korea-thing-is-going-to-go","country_name":"Canada","replies":2,"images":1,"unique_ips":2},{"no":122756366,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)13:05:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122756081\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122756081<\/a><br>Get out leaf","time":1493139947,"resto":122756081,"id":"C7WhrlTo","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122757289,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)13:13:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122756366\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122756366<\/a><br>Mark my words burger...","filename":"eatone","ext":".jpg","w":322,"h":156,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":60,"tim":1493140418889,"time":1493140418,"md5":"T\/U8WgQBsEHGa6v0ViuMqA==","fsize":10624,"resto":122756081,"id":"rsw7XK4u","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]}

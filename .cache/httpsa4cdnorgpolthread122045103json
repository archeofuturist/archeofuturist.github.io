That is why you end up with absurd decisions where a non-biological father is forced to pay child support for a kid who isn&#039;t his. The state sees it as one less kid that the state needs to care for.","time":1492723070,"resto":122045103,"id":"w6NhgXMu","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122046062,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)17:20:08","name":"S H A D I L A Y","com":"<a href=\"#p122045777\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122045777<\/a><br>I just said barring any discussions about kids.

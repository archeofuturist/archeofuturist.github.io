I cant seem to stir up any conversation that isn&#039;t about politics and most of the people i know have no interest in it. Theres no way I can talk about what i really want to and its really frustrating, Im becoming more and more socially awkward everyday.<br><br>What are some tricks you guys use to talk to normies and hide your powerlevels?","filename":"images","ext":".jpg","w":273,"h":184,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":168,"tim":1490171335897,"time":1490171335,"md5":"NSoTEgYCyIQ8kAuNcjPytQ==","fsize":3837,"resto":0,"id":"qzcrjD1a","country":"NZ","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"hiding-power-level","country_name":"New Zealand","replies":2,"images":1,"unique_ips":3},{"no":117739382,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)04:39:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117738732\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117738732<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;talk to normies<\/span><br>wat?","time":1490171981,"resto":117738732,"id":"jzzf1igB","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":117740662,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)04:59:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117738732\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117738732<\/a><br>I started noticing this about a year or so ago as well. <br><br>Now I use my vast knowledge of geopolitics and xenoanthropology to talk to normies about customs\/origins and historical trends of foreign cultures. My historical knowledge allowed me to have little trouble upgrading it with knowledge of art and artistic trends. Furthermore, my studies in medicine and my hobby of the sculpture of the flesh through fitness has provided me with ample authority to speak in terms of aesthetics and physical prowess overall. <br><br>Otherwise I stay silent and only state my observations when I feel logic has failed to appear to normies. As a consequence of this, the normies have come to respect my sigma position and look to me as the authority on more intellectual subjects; knowing full well that I do not bullshit, unlike the vast majority of them, since I have no need to prove myself to them in any way and thus no reason to pretend to know things I do not.","filename":"1470425985031","ext":".png","w":350,"h":338,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":120,"tim":1490173165523,"time":1490173165,"md5":"A+2Ls1HgwcKOnAYCs4Eusw==","fsize":17649,"resto":117738732,"id":"dJuUn\/3I","country":"TR","country_name":"Turkey"}]}

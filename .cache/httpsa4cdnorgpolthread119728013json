Its not illegal to be gay there... Why are the brave redditors and westerneres not fighting for rights of gay people in muslim countries? Even in most secular countries its a crime and in countries like Saudi Arabia where there is real islam gays are killed and i dont want to talk about how they treat women... Are they scared? Is it easier for liberals and feminists to act tough on white, christian conservative country? Or is it because Saudi Arabia is Us ally?","filename":"we did it reddit","ext":".png","w":1268,"h":734,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":144,"tim":1491473717964,"time":1491473717,"md5":"Sff89+ODgSpIB1EP\/IP1VQ==","fsize":226857,"resto":0,"id":"SqDc\/CQg","country":"RS","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"so-why-is-every-westerner-so-butthurt-over-putins","country_name":"Serbia","replies":2,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":119728574,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)06:23:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119728013\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119728013<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Or is it because Saudi Arabia is Us ally?<\/span><br>This.

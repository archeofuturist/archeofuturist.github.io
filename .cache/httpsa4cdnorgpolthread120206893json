Hyder Consulting was chosen to be the supervising engineer with NORR Group Consultants International Limited chosen to supervise the architecture of the project. The design is derived from the Islamic architecture of the region, such as in the Great Mosque of Samarra. The Y-shaped tripartite floor geometry is designed to optimize residential and hotel space. A buttressed central core and wings are used to support the height of the building. Although this design was derived from Tower Palace III, the Burj Khalifa\u2019s central core houses all vertical transportation with the exception of egress stairs within each of the wings.[10] The structure also features a cladding system which is designed to withstand Dubai&#039;s hot summer temperatures. It contains a total of 57 elevators and 8 escalators.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Arab muslim engineering<\/span>","time":1491697263,"resto":120206893,"id":"qFT5iYOd","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120207374,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)20:22:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120206893\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120206893<\/a><br><br>yeah he can&#039;t compete with a city entirely funded by the country he&#039;s the president of","time":1491697372,"resto":120206893,"id":"rcVGGzR4","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120208913,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)20:34:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120206893\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120206893<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Arab Muslim engineering is the ultimate red pill.<\/span>","filename":"3876806751[1]","ext":".jpg","w":609,"h":343,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1491698092393,"time":1491698092,"md5":"bOmvzoy6w1pJTHpJN61U4g==","fsize":39043,"resto":120206893,"id":"gMuJjnwB","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":120209113,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)20:36:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"this is leaf tier bate OP","time":1491698184,"resto":120206893,"id":"HbpEbNRU","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120209736,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)20:41:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120207152\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120207152<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Take out billions in loans to pay for construction.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Default on the FIRST payment and have to go to court to retain possession.<\/span><br><br>Arab Muslim financial planning.","time":1491698482,"resto":120206893,"id":"sYHDrWuE","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120210058,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)20:44:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120206893\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120206893<\/a><br><br>Hm yeah, sure looks like a liveable city and not a product of sandniggers just having too much oil money","time":1491698642,"resto":120206893,"id":"MNeb8yIR","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120210091,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)20:44:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"The Burj Khalifa was designed by Skidmore, Owings and Merrill (SOM), who also designed the Willis Tower (formerly the Sears Tower) in Chicago and the One World Trade Center in New York City.

People commit suicide at many, many times the rate of the general population for weeks when getting on and off these drugs, and nobody does anything about it. The first time I got off effexor i spent a year on ambien (which was also a bitch to quit), the second time i lasted five months before drinking myself sick because i couldn&#039;t sleep, and the third time i just couldn&#039;t handle the symptoms, pussed out, and got back on it.<br><br>many such cases!","time":1491196467,"resto":119292827,"id":"uhnmBfcd","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

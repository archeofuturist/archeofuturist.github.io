Trying to educate them is like bashing your head against a brick wall over and over again. Hopefully they&#039;ll know which way to point their guns when the shooting starts.","filename":"3f34920ffe731226fd6a501d24344355","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":716,"tn_w":209,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492100810466,"time":1492100810,"md5":"bh6qAJI33Bmol5ugdGQtNA==","fsize":148376,"resto":0,"id":"usY0zm5i","country":"FR","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"pol-would-you-support-a-revolution-against-the","country_name":"France","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

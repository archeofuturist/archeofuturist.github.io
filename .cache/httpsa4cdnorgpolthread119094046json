In March 2016, an asylum seeker from Eritrea whose name has only been given as A. circumcised her 4-year-old son, M. She did it herself in her home in Eilat and didn&#039;t use the instruments used in Jewish circumcision rituals.<br><br>The question is whether the woman committed a crime. The State Prosecutor\u2019s Office says she did. The indictment includes charges of grievous bodily harm and child abuse. If she is convicted of all the charges, the maximum sentence is 14 years in prison.<br><br>At the Be\u2019er Sheva District Court in recent months, the woman has completely denied that she performed a forbidden or illegal act.<br><br>The woman\u2019s lawyer, Moshe Serogovich from the Public Defender\u2019s Office, says not only does no law exist regulating the work of mohels, Jewish ritual circumcisers, but A. acted according to her cultural heritage. This cultural defense, as it were, would probably set a precedent in Israel if it works. A ruling is expected soon.<br><br>A., 37, has been in Israel since 2008, after she fled the village where she was born in Eritrea.","filename":"bibi-620x350","ext":".jpg","w":620,"h":350,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":141,"tim":1490990846990,"time":1490990846,"md5":"g7cfXi2ODhbChtV8Y6FC2Q==","fsize":122498,"resto":0,"id":"1acNPAKw","country":"IL","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"israel-charges-eritrean-mother-who-circumcised","country_name":"Israel","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":119094155,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)16:08:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119094046\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119094046<\/a><br>Don&#039;t you use fingernails and teeth?","time":1490990917,"resto":119094046,"id":"KGtGXiNI","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]}

He *seems* to want to shift the blame for economic stagnation of working and middle class onto the victims themselves (&quot;if they aren&#039;t smart enough to compete with foreigners\/ immigrants\/ other countries workers that artificially suppress the wage those workers recieve, then fuck em&#039; b\/c they deserve to get the shaft&quot; type mentality). He *seems* complacent and OK with exporting huge amounts of jobs while artificially lowering wages b\/c non-citizen workers. He never seems to address the long term problems of these stances and how it effects the long term stability of this country and how it burdens this country. Instead he focuses on the idea that allowing American and International businesses to make the most profits possible for the short term is some how the best way to keep this country stable. His attitude toward these issues appear to me to be a very elitist, anti-populist outlook. <br><br>I used &quot;*seems*&quot; b\/c I&#039;ve never watched him address these issues in depth and thoroughly; he just used quips and skirts the issues with apparent strawmen\/dismissive type approaches and arguments. IMO, this is why ppl will call him out for being a neocon shill and behaving like a kike or a jew -and I would not say that are are wrong. As an aside, he seems to be of the opinion that America should support Israel at ALL costs, no exceptions which doesn&#039;t help the case for him NOT being a neocon shill and behaving like a kike. Also, he tends to use debate tactics as opposed to just putting forth an idea and letting the idea stand on it&#039;s own merits. Basically, using language and framing an argument to win as opposed to winning by concept. This is also pretty stereotypical of the &quot;shifty jew&quot; trope. <br><br>So, when ppl call him out as behaving like a kike, are they wrong?","time":1492824085,"resto":122210393,"id":"+Z68QNTY","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122215046,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)21:23:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122211608\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122211608<\/a><br>supports mass immigration and white people going to war for greater israel <br><br>also debating retarded SJWs is being done by tons of people by now","time":1492824209,"resto":122210393,"id":"RNU\/PJF1","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":122215054,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)21:23:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122210393\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122210393<\/a><br>He&#039;s supporting ISIS by opposing Assad and being friendly to Saudi Arabia.

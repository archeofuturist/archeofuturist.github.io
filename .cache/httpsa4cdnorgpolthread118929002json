Do not listen to them! <br><br>They are agents, probably of Comcast if I had to guess, shilling an agenda. Internet privacy is an essential right, if not THE essential right, because the internet is the main way you as a modern human establish your relationship with the wider world. Actions taken with the internet set a precedent for every aspect of public (and non-local private) life.<br><br>You CAN NOT let this be taken away.

That&#039;s of no consequence, useful, but ultimately just a token in bureaucracy. Your knowledge, behavior, beliefs and habits are your soul. Real information is your soul. When a non-human entity knows you well enough to control you, when they have your essential information, they have your soul.","time":1490886486,"resto":118929002,"id":"na3ZjYfx","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118929360,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)11:11:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118929002\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118929002<\/a><br>Literally nothing.

They hate that we Reddit browsing and NPR listening coastal liberal &quot;elites&quot; are the winners in a service-based globalized multicultural society, and they blame all their failures on minorities and undocumented immigrants. They are seeing how America is increasingly becoming vibrantly diverse, and how non-white people will soon be the majority and losing their privilege terrifies them. They see Trump as the savior that will somehow make America go back to how it was in the 1960s, when in reality there is no going back because the values of the progressivism, social justice, feminism, diversity and tolerance are the right side of history.<br><br>Numerous scientific studies have shown that liberals are more intelligent than conservatives and base their view on objective reality rather than instinctual emotion. For example conservatives follow the base instinct of kin selection, where they give preference to those who are most genetically similar to them (which gives rise to racism and xenophobia). Liberals are more intellectually enlightened and realize that race and ethnicity are social constructs, and that we&#039;re all part of the same human species and that we should all share equally with each other and not give preference to those more genetically similar to us.","filename":"Antifu6","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":855,"tn_w":187,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492551273425,"time":1492551273,"md5":"fIUY45nJpiRia3HMat7m3g==","fsize":301972,"resto":0,"id":"S8jDBP\/m","country":"DE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-reality-is-trump-won-because-he-appealed-to","country_name":"Germany","replies":259,"images":83,"unique_ips":187,"tail_size":50},{"no":121744743,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)17:37:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;someone somewhere typed all this out<\/span>","filename":"1492380259910","ext":".png","w":420,"h":420,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492551426091,"time":1492551426,"md5":"ao6zs86ohJ0CU9\/UNkSpfw==","fsize":7755,"resto":121744383,"id":"KAU8sgya","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121745110,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)17:39:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121744383\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121744383<\/a>","filename":"YouHaveToGoBack","ext":".jpg","w":800,"h":820,"tn_w":121,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492551584841,"time":1492551584,"md5":"IEBfvj6X5fyhwpAYCZ3d+Q==","fsize":152643,"resto":121744383,"id":"Xjls9IB4","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121745297,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)17:41:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121744383\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121744383<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;liberals<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;view on objective reality<\/span><br>hahahaha","time":1492551672,"resto":121744383,"id":"rXxieSPK","country":"GR","country_name":"Greece"},{"no":121745345,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)17:41:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"Yeah you&#039;re so convincing when you type a lot of hoity toity &quot;I&#039;m a liberal so I&#039;m better than you.&quot; BS.

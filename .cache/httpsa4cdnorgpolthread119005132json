Yesterday, the Venezuelan Supreme Court declared all Senators in contempt of court, and dissolved the entire legislative branch of government in a desperate bid to quell the political unrest that is quickly spreading across the country. Riots and large scale lootings engulf the capital. Food supply has completely broken down and millions starve. There have even been cases of cannibalism in some parts of the country. Refugees are pouring into neighborhooding countries. <br><br>What is the US planning to do to stop this before it gets out of control and ends in a civil war?<br><br>There is still time. A military intervention could save millions of lives and prevent a catastrophe. <br><br>Please, Venezuela needs our help.&quot;","filename":"venezuela-map","ext":".jpg","w":1000,"h":950,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":237,"tim":1490926521187,"time":1490926521,"md5":"r+nDvx6KpvObZmB5tWQQcA==","fsize":495344,"resto":0,"id":"Esr+S\/Sx","country":"AR","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"please-help-venezuela","country_name":"Argentina","replies":7,"images":2,"unique_ips":8},{"no":119005472,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)22:18:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;democratic socialism isn&#039;t the same thing as communism<\/span>","filename":"HAHAAHHA","ext":".jpg","w":302,"h":174,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":72,"tim":1490926694044,"time":1490926694,"md5":"\/8Z0E7gVycaFaKzKlkc7rA==","fsize":23529,"resto":119005132,"id":"gI0OWc\/N","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119006045,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)22:23:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"Military intervention will simply add salt to the cut.

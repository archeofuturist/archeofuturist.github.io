American&#039;s like us put our money where our mouth&#039;s are when it comes to foreign intervention, as is traditional for our people. There were many Americans that volunteered on Rhodesia&#039;s side and probably more that formed the Abraham Lincoln Brigade. Politics aside American&#039;s have big dicks and kick a lot of ass world wide.","filename":"Christian Soldiers","ext":".jpg","w":1680,"h":1050,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":78,"tim":1490401300738,"time":1490401300,"md5":"OgsYGxtMFWqRaB2ocZnODw==","fsize":648286,"resto":118115731,"id":"DeVY1Z8w","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":118157384,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)20:22:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118155557\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118155557<\/a><br>:-)","filename":"ustr","ext":".jpg","w":3888,"h":2592,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1490401320050,"time":1490401320,"md5":"qBSoT+fcN7XNAfKu+8V8Ow==","fsize":1313473,"resto":118115731,"id":"tSXG1ILJ","country":"TR","m_img":1,"country_name":"Turkey"},{"no":118158205,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)20:28:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118120044\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118120044<\/a><br>comfy macedonia solution<br>50% to Bulgaria<br>25% to Serbia and Greece<br>50% of Albania to Serbia<br>50% of Albania to Grece","filename":"3 MORETA","ext":".jpg","w":1097,"h":769,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":87,"tim":1490401725197,"time":1490401725,"md5":"KtWdRqF4\/eGnZpU+G\/pKkw==","fsize":601309,"resto":118115731,"id":"jI5KEdTl","country":"RS","m_img":1,"country_name":"Serbia"},{"no":118158617,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)20:32:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118155007\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118155007<\/a><br><br>Gaddafi knew we were coming for him.

US military and foreign policy is much like the British Empires was. the only things that really matter is access to the oceans, and strategic projection of military force to back up economic and diplomatic power. <br><br>in this respect Turkey, while useful, is not necessary. The us is not limited by European geography. We don&#039;t need the Mediterranean sea or the suez canal to achieve our objectives. We also don&#039;t need the Bosphorus. these are &quot;nice to have&quot; conveniences. they are not critical infrastructure. <br><br>Critical for Europe, yes. Critical for the USA, no. Our critical strategic points are Panama, the Straights of Malacca, the Straights of Hormuz and our Pacific protectorates. Turkey does not fall under vital infrastructure. <br><br>in the cold war, it was the closest potential ally to the Soviet Union, but since the admission of eastern Europe to NATO, we no longer need Turkey for this role. It literally serves no function.","time":1490402425,"resto":118115731,"id":"7UUtCGBZ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118159761,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)20:41:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"eu cucks vs shitskin roaches<br>who will win?","time":1490402505,"resto":118115731,"id":"zFSMnwPh","country":"DK","country_name":"Denmark"},{"no":118160007,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)20:44:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118150859\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118150859<\/a><br>that additude and mindset is the exact same reason you lost<br>TWICE<br><br>youl soulless braindead autistic germans are the ultimate menace and cancer of europe<br><br>there won&#039;t be a third time charm for you<br>after the civil war in europe is done, you morons will be divided and constricted under the strict rules and supervision never again to be able to decide anything remotely important<br><br>kys","filename":"SERBIAN EAGLE DESTROYS OSTERO-MONGOLS","ext":".jpg","w":769,"h":488,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":79,"tim":1490402643217,"time":1490402643,"md5":"4UYNJjO3J3woEn63HKdLYw==","fsize":166521,"resto":118115731,"id":"jI5KEdTl","country":"RS","country_name":"Serbia"}]}

Often, when the ROK\u2019s were done with them, if the whores asked for money, they slit their throats. I had studied the history of South East Asia before I went over and knew how the Japanese and Chinese and other Asians brutalized the Koreans. Lot of prejudice and hatred of the Koreans, so they ROK\u2019s saw this as a chance to extract some long overdue vengeance.<br><br>I never went on an Op with them but a couple of my Rangers had been involved in a mission with them and told this story: During the Combined Op they had captured many NVA - it was quite a few.

Punching, kicking and yelling. All of a sudden, 2 ROK\u2019s grabbed the NVA they were interrogating (beating) and threw him out the door..bye bye. He told us the other NVA were literally pissing their pants and the ROK\u2019s began working them over and yelling at them. A few minutes later, same thing..bye bye. The door gunners were trying to stay out of the way and the Huey pilots were shitting bricks and yelling at my Rangers to stop them.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;My Rangers told the pilots NFW were they gonna even try! They just let the ROK\u2019s do their thing and stayed out of their way. Rangers ain\u2019t afraid of nothing but they sure aren\u2019t dumb. By the time they got back to the acid pad at the fire base, no more NVA prisoners..but the ROK\u2019s had gotten an amazing amount of useful Intel. Over time I heard similar stories of the ROK\u2019s doing more of what we called \u201cairborne\u201d interrogations. The ROK\u2019s were just plain Dien-Cai-Dao: (Pronounced \u201cdinky-dow\u201d.

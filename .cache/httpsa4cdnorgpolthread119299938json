If the NAP is understood as akin to \u201ctell the truth\u201d\u2014one among many rules of thumb that establish rebuttable presumptions for guiding your daily conduct\u2014then it is perfectly servicable. May I respond to an insulting remark by throwing a punch? I may not. But that is not really how libertarians usually want to use the NAP: Rather, it is meant to serve as a kind of master principle from which other more concrete rules may be derived, and against which competing forms of social order may be evaluated. And for that purpose it is not particularly useful. When we are not looking for rough guides to our day-to-day conduct, but engaged in the rather more leisurely activity of theory-building, there is less practical reason to rely on simplified models because \u201cthe math is easier,\u201d and more to the point, we are most likely to be wrestling with precisely the kind of hard cases that arguably constitute exceptions to the rough rule, or deciding between variant forms of the very concepts on which the NAP relies.&quot;","time":1491211386,"resto":119299938,"id":"B4I1fQ1Y","country":"US","trip":"!!nRmWeBC0+kN","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119310491,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)05:23:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119310311\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119310311<\/a><br>That&#039;s why an cap societies need a strong central government to ensure they don&#039;t","time":1491211389,"resto":119299938,"id":"nX+yqJ79","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119310524,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)05:23:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119310173\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119310173<\/a><br>That would be more the case of classical liberal minarchism.<br><br>I&#039;m not saying that a rogue agency couldn&#039;t try to overcome the population and establish a monopoly on security\/violence (a state).

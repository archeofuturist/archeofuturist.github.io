Jesus christ, you don&#039;t know what you are talking about. By the way, the following is not necessarily my opinion, but it is how libertarian theory and the NAP applies to ancapism, you just dont know what the fuck you are talking about. If you are actually serious about an ancap society then you believe that states are unjust aggressors, and war is nothing more than a way for innocent citizens to get sucked into the state&#039;s war, which they are then forced to support. Normally two states view each other&#039;s citizens as extensions of the state, and even civilians are ok to bomb since they are supporting the war effort financially and with their labor, and are therefore also part of the aggression, so ever since ww2 states bomb even each other&#039;s civilian population. If you are an ancap then you should not be ok with bombing an aggressing state&#039;s civilian population, as you view them as innocents who are being forced into a war by their own state. If you support nuking innocents then you are not a true libertarian, but instead just cherry pick what you like and don&#039;t like. Now, I don&#039;t care, because I dont really consider myself a hardcore libertarian. But people like you are the reason why libertarianism and ancapism will probably never work, 90% of libertarians and ancaps dont understand their own ideologies and are not consistent in their beliefs, leading to major disagreements in many aspects of their ideologies.","time":1490993549,"resto":119081436,"id":"FTuWdG0f","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119098581,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)16:52:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119098019\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119098019<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;no fun allowed:the post<\/span><br>I can argue with someone and having bantz you dunce","time":1490993576,"resto":119081436,"id":"DIp7BDof","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":119098736,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)16:54:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119098581\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119098581<\/a><br>Alright, fair enough pal.

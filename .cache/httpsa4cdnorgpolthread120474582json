The amount of people in an emergency waiting room with non-emergency problems is staggering. My mom is a Nurse in Calgary and the typical wait time at her urgent care centre is between 6-8 hours. The triage helps but the sheer volume of billy bruised knees and sally sore throats overloads the system. In terms of surgical procedures the wait times are even worse, because again, everyone and their fucking doggo get any procedure for free. I for instance have a epigastric hernia that i&#039;ve had since birth. Now that i&#039;m lifting more it&#039;s become a problem. After waiting three months for an initial appointment, I have to wait nine more months for the procedure.<br><br>I could drive to fucking Helena, MT and have it done next week for a couple thousands bucks...","time":1491851692,"resto":120474582,"id":"upFZVynO","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120475731,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)15:15:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120474582\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120474582<\/a><br>It doesn&#039;t include drugs or dental.<br><br>Other than that, don&#039;t buy the hype.

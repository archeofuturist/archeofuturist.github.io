The Assad family has been in power for 40+ years (dictators), and cracks down on protests against his abuses of power with violence. Assad must go before any solution can be reached. Until then, the proxy war continues, which will continue to drain Russian coffers. Remember, the &quot;coalition&quot; countries are vastly more wealthy than the Axis of Evil countries (Russia, Syria, Iran, etc) - the coalition has control over 50%+ of Syria&#039;s borders, can easily transport weapons and fighters into Syria, isn&#039;t spending much money on proxies, and will continue to stoke this civil war until a political solution is reached. No military power will win this conflict, because 1) the coalition isn&#039;t going to put boots on the ground to decisively win (and provoke Russia at the same time), and 2) the Axis of Evil countries are not powerful enough to win the war against rebel groups &amp; Western\/Sunni proxy forces.<br><br>When Russia has lost enough money over this situation (apparently not yet), they&#039;ll start agreeing to come to the table. It will be quiet and behind the scene to save face, and the West will be OK with that. The political solution at the end of this is going to remove Assad, allow Alawites to stay in power, and allow autonomous governance regions within Syria (without breaking up the existing borders). The West will maintain its positions of strength by supporting autonomous Kurdish regions in Iraq and Syria, Sunni countries will support other autonomous regions for the &quot;rebel&quot; factions, Russia will maintain its position of strength with existing military bases and continued relations with the ruling Alawites, Iran will be removed to appease Israel, and Assad will either take refuge in Russia\/Iran or be tried and

Do you fear death and if you don&#039;t, what helped you achieve <br>this. <br><br>As for myself, I have been ready for quite some time, but I am a calculative and articulate person. I have made many white men and women aware of what is happening to our society, I will tell you that the best way to initially get someone to realise what is happening is to tell them that immigration is pushed by international corporations to create a surplus of workers to stagnate wages. They will retort about getting an education and you will respond by saying most of our immigration (In America) are H1-b visas for skilled workers who then have children here and nationalize themselves. This harms our native population by decreasing wages,demand and in result motivation for natives to get educated in that area.You must also mention the cost of having children has inflated to the point that you either have to lower your living standard (Skilled Immigrants don&#039;t have to as there living standard is much lower) or receive government aid (Affirmative action favor&#039;s under represented minorities) in order to raise and rear (Stay at home parent) strong children. I usually follow up with demographic displacement statistics, our debt, welfare spending and already failed multicultural society&#039;s (Central and South America). I end it by telling them that the only thing keeping America from being a third world country is currency manipulation (See 22 trillion debt).<br><br>1\/3","filename":"20170422_231009","ext":".jpg","w":2560,"h":1440,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1493457331115,"time":1493457331,"md5":"pXOU0jh6NpNnJofaHeheBA==","fsize":812877,"resto":0,"id":"TQsSNYFp","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"what-would-push-you-far-enough-to-take-up-arms","country_name":"United States","replies":5,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":123315867,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)05:16:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123315799\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123315799<\/a><br><br>For my second question, if somehow a significant resistance took place in America for values that I supported (White nationalism; to further explain I know nationalism is not <br>sustainable but it is in times of despair, which we would be in whilst retaking our countries and that a certain degree of socialism is superior when in a homeogenous nation; see Europe pre-Immigration) I would head for the midwest farming communities (I only see this happening in a SHTF scenario, if a tribalism effect happened whilst in the current economic regime I would have a different strategy) and help defend blockades into the coastal cities to starve them.","time":1493457392,"resto":123315799,"id":"TQsSNYFp","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123315934,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)05:17:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123315867\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123315867<\/a><br>For my third and most important, are you ready to give your life for the greater good? I can honestly say yes, even with the nihilistic (((science))) and me not believing in god or an afterlife. I got to this point by lots and lots of historical research, I am fascinated by military history and seeing the amount of men who gave there life for what they believed in made me feel insignificant. I see the decline of society, what has caused it and I see it&#039;s inevitable result, most of you do as well. I saw my younger brother who is absolutely brilliant become un-interested in school, recognizing the subversion with a meticulous and bland curriculum that encourages stagnation at such a <br>young age. My teenage sister be forced into a school with a large minority group due to rezoning and affirmative action, despite my single mother (Had me when she was 17 and <br>yes a different dad than my brother and sister) taking life by the balls when she had to and raising them in a upper-class rural area (My highschool was 100% white, while I went to elementary in a ghetto shithole). My sister and I are really close, I have told her everything and she is a sponge, a smart one that challenges my un-orthodox views. I would die for my family, no I do not have children yet so I cannot speak from that point of view but I am in the mindset now that I do.<br><br>Unrelated to my questions, I want to say fuck the divide and conqueor tactics, if you can visually and mentally pass for European, you are a part of this club. As for Non-whites in America, I hold no grudge, I know it isn&#039;t your fault that it got this bad. If as a society we can stand up soon, we may be able to fight together to retake white countries and you will be rewarded I am sure. However, if it happens to forment with our back into a corner that we only have one way out, I suggest stepping aside.","time":1493457470,"resto":123315799,"id":"TQsSNYFp","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123316349,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)05:24:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;it&#039;s the daily FBI thread<\/span>","time":1493457895,"resto":123315799,"id":"Ao8tEPhT","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":123316396,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)05:25:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123315867\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123315867<\/a><br>Another event that would cause me to go full partisan is a war against Russia.

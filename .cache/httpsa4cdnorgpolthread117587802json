If you can afford to buy things outside of being a necessity, you don&#039;t need tax payer assistance. Cable, smart phones, DRUGS, fast food etc... All things someone who truly needs assistance wouldn&#039;t be able to afford.<br><br>They don&#039;t look into any of this though. For example, to get food stamps all you have say is &quot;I don&#039;t have a job, no bank account, no money&quot; and you&#039;re good.

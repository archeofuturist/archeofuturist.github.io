Orthopraxy, if not stifling to the level of a Muslim or Hindu or Ultra-Orthodox Jewish kind of society, is invaluable in promoting that sense of solidarity and providing an ideal of right conduct in society. Sure most do not always recognize that ideal but they can aspire and work to it. Orthodoxy is literal thought-criminality and the only reason to pursue it is to avoid its promotion of unorthopraxy. A lack of religiousity in a society is not always a guarantee of failure (the Late Romans were more faithful than the Imperial but they fell) but you almost never find an instance of a society being successful without some kind of religious ethos (even if gommunism\/Maoism\/nationalism) guiding it.","time":1491216639,"resto":119306983,"id":"CcnqaBxJ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119315747,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)06:54:19","name":"@TheImperialCult","com":"<a href=\"#p119315003\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119315003<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;mfw video isn&#039;t available<\/span><br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=amY<wbr>1GABiiyY","filename":"Arch_of_titus_2","ext":".jpg","w":1600,"h":1200,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1491216859058,"time":1491216859,"md5":"1rUS+f8dYrweilSx8uAVBw==","fsize":677346,"resto":119306983,"id":"OP\/7DWLB","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":119317239,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)07:19:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119310930\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119310930<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;If I could swallow a pill that would make me believe in a higher being and an afterlife, I would do it in a second.<\/span><br>You are like a little baby.

We do know that women wore wigs whether they were bald or not. So too did men, Emperor Otho wore a wig, as did Domitian.[11] Wigs allowed women to better achieve the kind of &#039;tall&#039; styles that particularly punctuated the Flavian and Trajanic eras (e.g. the periods of 69\u201396 and 98\u2013117 CE). In fact, so tall were these hairstyles, that ancient writer Juvenal likens them to multi-storey buildings.<br><br> So important is the business of beautification; so numerous are the tiers and storeys piled one upon another on her head!<br> \u2014Juvenal, Satires[12]<br><br>Wigs were made from human hair; blonde hair from Germany and black from India were particularly prized, especially if the hair came from the head of a person from a conquered civilisation.[13] The blond hair of various Germanic peoples symbolized the spoils of war. In cases where wigs were used to hide baldness, a natural look was preferred, therefore a wig with a hair colour similar to the wearer&#039;s original would be worn. But in instances where a wig was worn for the purpose of showing off, naturalism did not play much of a part. In fact, obviously fake wigs were preferred, sometimes intertwined with two contrasting hair colours with blonde hair from Germany and black from India.[14] Gold dust also gave the appearance of blond hair and enhanced already blond hair. The Emperor Lucius Verus (r. 161 \u2013 169 AD), who had natural blond hair, was said to sprinkle gold dust on his head to make himself even blonder.[15]","filename":"froggo","ext":".jpg","w":1200,"h":1200,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492621239784,"time":1492621239,"md5":"\/ZQZ+xIlKZda+mNYu6M57w==","fsize":190032,"resto":121849262,"id":"qvQFJA67","country":"CR","m_img":1,"country_name":"Costa Rica"},{"no":121865852,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)13:01:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121865709\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121865709<\/a><br>Some greeks had blonde hair, that doesn&#039;t mean they were muh pure nordics","filename":"Gaziantep-Zeugma-Mosaic-Museum-1623","ext":".jpg","w":900,"h":600,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1492621296950,"time":1492621296,"md5":"rFPKz8Tzom+ABMI6HSYOEA==","fsize":158421,"resto":121849262,"id":"wLb8hw+N","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":121865984,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)13:02:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"I am Norwegian.

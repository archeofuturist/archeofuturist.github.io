Nunes, the guy who leaked that the trump transition team was surveilled, is the Republican head of the intelligence committee. Adam Schiff, the cuck who leaked that he had evidence (despite not providing any) of collusion between trump and russia is the Democratic head of the intelligence committee. There&#039;s literally a civil cold war brewing. Go to r politics and these morons are all circle jerking about how the Russian connection evidence will supposedly surface soon. Expect team trump to put out more evidence of the Obama administration faggotry. Shits about to get real. We need all autists to investigate on this. Remember to sage all shill and bait threads.","filename":"1489977955417m","ext":".jpg","w":663,"h":1024,"tn_w":161,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490262134376,"time":1490262134,"md5":"Gu+MNQgRVEtN8vhoz+nF6w==","fsize":91173,"resto":0,"id":"9gkvYXmV","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"american-politics-civil-war","country_name":"Canada","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

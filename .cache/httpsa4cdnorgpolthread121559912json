This is a known fact. Feminism has made the idea of marriage politically and financially dangerous. They may seem happy, but they are ticking time bombs and you won&#039;t know anything&#039;s wrong until the day she fucking cracks and decides she&#039;s not happy with her life, abandons you and your kids, and runs away to another state to sleep around, do drugs, and practice Wicca.<br><br>Now, I have read anon posts where they say a prenup doesn&#039;t mean shit, saying that an SJW judge could throw the prenup out and give the woman all your stuff anyways. Is this true?<br><br>What are some ways to protect yourself before marrying, during the marriage, and when you find out a divorce is imminent?","filename":"eliBill","ext":".png","w":454,"h":463,"tn_w":245,"tn_h":249,"tim":1492453728780,"time":1492453728,"md5":"qrpSylGtX9u877LH7rRDBg==","fsize":220606,"resto":0,"id":"FECG\/+TK","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"can-we-get-a-thread-going-on-how-to-protect","country_name":"United States","replies":4,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":121560626,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)14:33:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121559912\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121559912<\/a><br>That&#039;s bullshit, a prenup is a legally binding document, unless it breaks the law in some way a judge cannot throw it out.<br><br>Make sure it includes severability and have a lawyer help you wright it, and you&#039;ll be untouchable in court.","time":1492454031,"resto":121559912,"id":"kSKP9hI5","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121560679,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)14:34:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"Nigga there are hollyjewd millionaires that can afford the best team of kike lawyers this side of the ashtray and they still end up paying millions, every time. <br><br>Either have nothing or don&#039;t marry.

That and realising that Francis is constantly misquoted to fit whatever agenda journalists want him to support and as a consequence that headlines you read are mostly complete bullshit. For example, remember the famous &quot;Who am I to judge?&quot; People will go apeshit about &quot;acceptance of gays&quot;, but there is nothing like this in context, which is simply a condemnation of LGBT lobbies.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;So much is written about the gay lobby. I still haven\u2019t found anyone with an identity card in the Vatican with \u201cgay\u201d on it. They say there are some there. I believe that when you are dealing with such a person, you must distinguish between the fact of a person being gay and the fact of someone forming a lobby, because not all lobbies are good. This one is not good. If someone is gay and is searching for the Lord and has good will, then who am I to judge him? The Catechism of the Catholic Church explains this in a beautiful way, saying ... wait a moment, how does it say it ... it says: \u201cno one should marginalize these people for this, they must be integrated into society\u201d. The problem is not having this tendency, no, we must be brothers and sisters to one another, and there is this one and there is that one. The problem is in making a lobby of this tendency: a lobby of misers, a lobby of politicians, a lobby of masons, so many lobbies.<\/span>","time":1491171546,"resto":119251775,"id":"wvBVRsIE","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":119254023,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)18:20:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119253834\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119253834<\/a>","filename":"dca","ext":".png","w":600,"h":627,"tn_w":119,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491171620610,"time":1491171620,"md5":"ot+n3DRBj7E2Z86v26siwQ==","fsize":274897,"resto":119251775,"id":"yznLwVr0","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":119254316,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)18:23:03","name":"MUSLIMS AND CUCKTHOLICS WORSHIP THE SAME DEVIL","com":"<a href=\"#p119253900\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119253900<\/a><br>daily reminder that according to catholic cathecism catholics and muslims worship the same god<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;841 <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The Church&#039;s relationship with the Muslims. &quot;The plan of salvation also includes those who acknowledge the Creator, in the first place amongst whom are the Muslims;

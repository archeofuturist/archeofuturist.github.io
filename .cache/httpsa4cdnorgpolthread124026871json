In addition to this, he seems to wholly isolate himself from criticism, and many of his staff is afraid to bring any concerns to his attention. This kind of team culture reeks of petty dictatorships within the team and insecurity. I think this is in large part due to the fact that he has basically always been at the top of his professional hierarchies since the start of his career, and has little experience cooperating and being held accountable to someone above him; as the president you should serve and be held accountable by your people, not lord over them which the latter seems to be his modus operandi.","time":1493879255,"resto":124026871,"id":"Jz3LWKQP","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124030113,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)02:29:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124026871\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124026871<\/a><br>Hoped for better.

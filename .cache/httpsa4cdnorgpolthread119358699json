Fact is, you associate your religion with culture, and it is that culture that gives one the security to let go of the &#039;self&#039; and have a religious experience because of cultural familiarity. <br><br>There is an inherent problem with this idea of a universal singular deity, such that, universalism allows, and even demands, a large following of all people, which is to say multi-culturalism. <br><br>The Jew is tribal. The Jew does not fret over security of its &#039;people&#039; because the religion of the Jew is not universal, aside from the subjugation of all under the chosen Jew. The Christian and Muslim faiths are that Jewish universalism literally in practice. Better put, your individual self or people matter less than the collective of beliefs associated with your Jesus or Mohammed, and the Jew claims individual authority over you. The tribal religious person is not subjugated under a set of doctrines and dogmas in the same manner as if under a universal religion because the tribe and the culture borne from it is defined by the individual--longevity over faith.<br><br>How slavish you universalist sheep are! How pathetic and self destructive you are!","filename":"0062522954756efa052073a07338dd6f9badfce7f88922af3c268b30a0d8ff66","ext":".jpg","w":395,"h":395,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491243276355,"time":1491243276,"md5":"t+5OmAw5w49a97\/S1zAQJQ==","fsize":44170,"resto":0,"id":"UMo94Xoe","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"culture-and-muh-religion","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":119360529,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)14:27:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119358699\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119358699<\/a><br>It is no surprise to me that the brave Christian and Muslim do not speak about this.

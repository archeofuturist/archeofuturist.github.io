A strawman fallacy is actually more complex than most people understand: It consists in misrepresenting your opponent&#039;s position in order to make it appear weaker, then attacking this misrepresented position instead of the real one so as to make their position appear superior. The retort to such a fallacy is simply to explain how your opponent is misrepresenting your position, therefore making his position appear weaker since you make it seem as if he does not understand the issue at hand. This is why strawman arguments are very popular with essayists, columnists and the such: No one to talk back.<br><br>A fake strawman claim is easy to recognize: The first sign is that the person claiming you are using a strawman argument will not explain their own position, or try to explain why your depiction of their position is wrong. They&#039;ll simply go &quot;Nice strawman&quot; and leave it at that. This is most common when you prove without a shred of a doubt that your opponent is wrong; it&#039;s a last ditch attempt at denying that you rebutted their point.","time":1493394896,"resto":123208103,"id":"JAN1ixBP","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":123208597,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)11:54:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123208103\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123208103<\/a><br>oh you&#039;re a trump supporter? <br><br>fookn nazi","time":1493394898,"resto":123208103,"id":"u+tpLs1A","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":123208604,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)11:55:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123208103\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123208103<\/a><br>A strawmen is a fallacy of setting up a really weak argument that is easily disproven, and making it seem that is what your opponent argues or trick your opponent into defending that weak argument.<br><a href=\"#p123208339\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123208339<\/a><br>or the \/pol\/ sticky...","time":1493394900,"resto":123208103,"id":"6IaJZYgH","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123208930,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)11:57:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"I saw the Strawman at a grocery store in Los Angeles yesterday. I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn&#039;t want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything. <br><br>He said, &quot;Oh, like you&#039;re doing now?&quot; <br><br>I was taken aback, and all I could say was &quot;Huh?&quot; but he kept cutting me off and going &quot;huh? huh? huh?&quot; and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying. <br><br>The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like &quot;Sir, you need to pay for those first.&quot; At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter. <br><br>When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually &quot;to prevent any electrical infetterence,&quot; and then turned around and winked at me. I don&#039;t even think that&#039;s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly.","time":1493395076,"resto":123208103,"id":"W4h8+dbi","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123209086,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)11:59:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123208103\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123208103<\/a><br>If you say <br>&quot;I don&#039;t think blacks are bad&quot;<br>And I say <br>&quot;Look at this fucking cuck saying blacks are superior to whites in every way&quot;<br>Then I would have strawmanned your original claim","time":1493395158,"resto":123208103,"id":"JuZoIN37","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123209116,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)11:59:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123208103\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123208103<\/a><br><br>This question even being asked is a sad reflection on our current education system.

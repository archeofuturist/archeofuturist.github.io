Do you blatantly defend Trump in every thread?<br>The fact is that Trump had no legitimate grounds to do what he did. He campaigned as a non-interventionist and the reasons for doing what he did, while unknown, are absurdly worrying. I do not buy for one moment he did it because of China since China wouldn&#039;t give a fuck. Conflict between the two nations will achieve nothing but severe damage to both parties even if we win. China will keep pushing an doing what it wants until they feel that they&#039;re at the line that shouldn&#039;t be crossed, bombing Assad doesn&#039;t move that line.<br>I believe Trump did it to appease the democrats. It was just 2~ weeks ago when he shat all over the Freedom Cacus and stated that he wants to work closely with the democrats. Guess who&#039;s really happy now? The democrats and the leftist Republican McCain. All it took was shitting on his self-image and his voter base. Whatever delusion Trump was under caused him to create such a rift that supporters everywhere are pissed off. Look at the current state of \/pol\/ and youtube videos. Shaprio&#039;s video has a 25% dislike ratio and many others are in agreement that Trump fucked up. You cannot write this off as shills. The only reason T_D doesn&#039;t have bitching about Trump is because they silence everyone who was against it.<br>That and the shit with Bannon is also problematic.

Between 2012 and 2014, nearly 11 of every 1,000 black babies born in Okaloosa County failed to make it to their first birthday, while 4.2 of every 1,000 white babies failed to survive their first year.<br><br>Chapman said a hormone called cortisol, one that contributes to the &quot;fight or flight&quot; reaction noted in humans and animals, is being looked at as a possible culprit in the black baby birth dilemma.<br><br>&quot;A black woman walks into a room and she&#039;s judged differently, there&#039;s a different perception,&quot; Chapman explained. &quot;It&#039;s a constant stressor, to have people afraid of you, to be judged because of the color of your skin, and there&#039;s growing evidence the chronic stress of being treated differently as a black woman has an impact on prematurity and low birth rate.&quot;<br><br>The constant barrage of negativity or malice, triggering a repeated release of cortisol, can restrict blood flow, Chapman said, &quot;and if it&#039;s doing that the baby is not getting what it needs.&quot;<br><br>Cortisol also plays a role in reproduction and could trigger labor, she said.<br><br>Joyce Matthews, whose infant grandson, Zion Brown, was stillborn in 2014, was born and raised in Laurel Hill. That community has seen a higher-than-average infant mortality rate in recent years, particularly for black babies.<br><br>Matthews said she knows many other Laurel Hill residents who have lost infants. While she never considered the effect racism could have on African-American women who are pregnant, upon reflection, she conceded that it might play a role.<br><br>&quot;Some of my white friends may not realize that there&#039;s racism in our community, because it doesn&#039;t affect them,&quot; Matthews said. &quot;We could be sitting in a room together and I&#039;ll be quiet because of some remark that was made. My friends don&#039;t even realize it was racist. But that feeling is there, and I can see where it could be a stressor.&quot;","filename":"bbbbb","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":315,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":131,"tim":1490532754776,"time":1490532754,"md5":"X1ocatRgwE9MgLOca33cPA==","fsize":84970,"resto":0,"id":"oStbE2f+","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"is-racism-killing-black-babies","country_name":"United States","replies":3,"images":1,"unique_ips":4},{"no":118358678,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)08:54:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118358548\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118358548<\/a><br>racism is bad parenting now ?","time":1490532865,"resto":118358548,"id":"Z7+EKndg","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":118358779,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)08:55:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118358548\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118358548<\/a><br>Black parents are killing black babies.<br>Pic related.<br>Now GTFO.","filename":"Blacks 3x More Likely to Kill Their Children","ext":".jpg","w":720,"h":720,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490532944267,"time":1490532944,"md5":"sGOD7bKiW9LzxT01zDStwg==","fsize":70651,"resto":118358548,"id":"yR9rGPPU","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118359670,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)09:07:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"Honestly, I do stereotype black women but I have a much more positive view of them than their male counterparts.

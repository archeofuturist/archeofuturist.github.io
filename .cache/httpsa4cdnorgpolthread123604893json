It&#039;s done through shame tactics and constant reminders of a darker history, which effectively brainwashes the populace by framing their reality and therefore modes of thinking.<br><br>People with a utopian view seem to think that when all the groups are more even in representation, that we will suddenly have a more just society where everyone is respected. Where everyone will be so diluted and mixed and diverse that these group lines won&#039;t matter anymore. The other school of thought is that this won&#039;t be the case at all. White people were the glue holding society together and if white people lose their position as the arbiters of society it will just be a clusterfuck of violence and oppression. <br><br>So to me, despite a lot of the radical posts around here, preserving the whites is mainly about preserving the power balance. After all, it was WESTERN civilization which has enabled all these scientific advances and an era of peace and stability (unless you&#039;re from the Middle East) virtually unseen in history, ever. And this dynamic is far too precious to sacrifice and throw in the garbage based on what amounts to an ideological experiment.

Films like Kidulthood that promote drugs, violence and nigger street slang are served on a plate to teenagers at the &#039;15&#039; rating while family-friendly anime like K-On! gets slapped with a &#039;12&#039; rating because Yui got called a retard once.<br><br>The puritans at the BBFC ensure that as little anime as possible is released in the UK by enforcing expensive classification fees, \u00a375 just for submitting your anime and around \u00a36 for every minute of video. By the time your anime consisting of twelve episodes with each being 30 minutes long has been reviewed, you will have racked up a costly \u00a32,340 bill for a meaningless age rating that will have most likely stopped your target market from actually buying it. Now you&#039;ll be forced to sell your product for an extortionate price on the shelves.<br><br>Just buy an American BD and DVD player, a USA to UK plug adapter and import your anime.","filename":"9ce8df6f4a7acf2cd591429f3545fafe","ext":".png","w":718,"h":306,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":53,"tim":1491923241986,"time":1491923241,"md5":"nOjfb0p6zyzVkUKfNUX6\/g==","fsize":127127,"resto":120596545,"id":"weZiiOpv","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120608155,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)11:08:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120607963\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120607963<\/a><br>I would love to get raped in my tight little boipucci by a superior Russian soldier.","filename":"sniffer_dog_identifies_drugmule","ext":".jpg","w":634,"h":690,"tn_w":114,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491923311549,"time":1491923311,"md5":"2vD1ZVFSqyGW33Ky59g+1Q==","fsize":124686,"resto":120596545,"id":"eGcT80sh","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120608175,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)11:08:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120607878\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120607878<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;CurryWurst<\/span><br>Good choice anon","time":1491923323,"resto":120596545,"id":"7VU1Z8e9","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120608266,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)11:09:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120607499\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120607499<\/a><br><br>Looks like something from Dominions 4.<br><br>The ultimate autist&#039;s game.","filename":"dom4fight2","ext":".jpg","w":1197,"h":701,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":73,"tim":1491923374786,"time":1491923374,"md5":"H07eRGQXCzMi1\/QaZ0tqVw==","fsize":425766,"resto":120596545,"id":"kPdjj5o8","country":"GB","m_img":1,"country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120608296,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)11:09:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120607994\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120607994<\/a><br>The brutal truth.","time":1491923394,"resto":120596545,"id":"eGcT80sh","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120608303,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)11:09:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120607994\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120607994<\/a><br>good.

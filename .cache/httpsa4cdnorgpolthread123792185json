Naturally, men and women complement each other with the purpose of having kids and raising them to be successful. But here&#039;s the kicker that fucked that relationship. <br><br>Society and the powers to be have told them they are allowed to do whatever they want now. Every single day women are bombarded with images and articles on their phones talking about sexual liberation and the feminine power they think is real. Some of them even get entire degrees dedicated to the subject, which as a concept is absolutely retarded. Women are encouraged to slut it up or &quot;express themselves,&quot; disavow responsibility, and generally act like children. Don&#039;t worry about finding someone that will genuinely care for you and raise a good family. Find as many sexual partners as possible, live without worrying about consequences, have fun. Take these pills we produce that fucks with your hormones making you partially crazy so you can have fun without facing consequences. <br><br>The problem with that much self indulgence is that it leads to emptiness. There is no meaning in a life that revolves around getting shitfaced and banging some random dude you met at the club on the weekends. Sure, it&#039;s fun. But fun doesn&#039;t give people connections, just meaningless sex. Fun doesn&#039;t build strong bonds that make men and women compatible to raise a family. <br><br>Then there are the career women that push all meaningful connections out of their lives to chase a dollar. Something they are told they can do because it&#039;s the current year. If you think that lifestyle destroys makes men into lifeless husks imagine what it does to women. The sex that is far more emotional and likely to crack under pressure. <br><br>A man worth his salt looks at those train wrecks and says &quot;fuck that,&quot; and those women are left alone wondering where all the good men have gone. Wondering why they can only find pieces of shit that dodge responsibly and are as selfish as they are.","filename":"space carl","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":720,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1493749057493,"time":1493749057,"md5":"gpjSaYs93\/9jbeUqiARRsw==","fsize":93454,"resto":123792185,"id":"IHqLbvul","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":123797891,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)14:17:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123792185\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123792185<\/a><br><br>Women are unhappy because they are getting what they said they needed in order to be happy.","time":1493749061,"resto":123792185,"id":"05jejjO7","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123797966,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)14:18:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;feminism<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;sexual liberation<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;woman power<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;having kids means not having a life&quot;<\/span>","time":1493749096,"resto":123792185,"id":"1Xzy\/yhg","country":"MX","country_name":"Mexico"},{"no":123798094,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)14:19:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123797461\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123797461<\/a><br>Mail bride is too obvious, women in army are whores and need to be exterminated anyway, unless trained properly.

He was transported to UMass Memorial Hospital-Leominster, where he was pronounced dead at 4:07 a.m.[10][92][93][11] State Department of Correction spokesman Christopher Fallon first said no suicide note was found in Hernandez&#039;s single-occupant cell, but on April 20, 2017, investigators reported that three handwritten notes were next to a Bible opened to John 3:16 and &quot;John 3:16&quot; was written on his forehead in ink.[94] One note said he was entering the &quot;timeless realm&quot; and would see his family in heaven while another note said he loved his family and told them not to shed a tear; soap was found covering the floor and there were drawings in blood on the walls showing an unfinished pyramid and the all-seeing eye of God with the word &quot;Illuminati&quot; written in capital letters underneath.[95] Prison officials had not observed any signs that Hernandez was at risk for suicide, so he was not put on around-the-clock watch.[96] Upon completion of the autopsy by the medical examiner, the death has been officially ruled a suicide. Hernandez&#039;s brain was released to Boston University to be studied for signs of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a progressive degenerative disease found in people who have had a severe blow or repeated blows to the head.[97] His lawyer-agent, Jose Baez, disputed any claim of suicide, initiating his own investigation of the death.[98]","filename":"image","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":667,"tn_w":187,"tn_h":249,"tim":1492996011008,"time":1492996011,"md5":"o7QH+rlsjEf0vDHYY\/vx3A==","fsize":76946,"resto":0,"id":"nIv4nKJw","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"illuminati-blood-pyramid","country_name":"United States","replies":39,"images":10,"unique_ips":32},{"no":122520045,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)21:10:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"sa ge in options field.

What I&#039;ve heard is that because he was found not guilty of the double homicide, they were calling his motive for the first homicide into question. They were in the process of appealing his first sentence. Apparently, because he killed himself after the appeal was filed, he still, technically, hasn&#039;t been found guilty of any wrongdoing. This apparently makes it harder for his victims to get access to his estate and will more than likely result in his daughter receiving all of his money. Take that for what you will, that&#039;s just what I&#039;ve been hearing about the whole thing.

Killing is a thrill, just ask any hunter. They love to watch things die. Humans are predators by nature; this isn&#039;t hard to tell. However, the transition from hunting to agriculture forced a repression of our natural urge to kill...<br><br>How does this connect to child sacrifice and cults? The cult part is simple; it&#039;s theater. Some legitimately believe in the spiritual side of the cults, but most attend in order to witness the spectacle. You don&#039;t get to see that kind of stuff anywhere else, and #YOLO...<br><br>The child sacrifice is a little more complicated, and this is simply my theory\/opinion. Killing weak or sick things feels better than killing healthy things. I base this theory off of evolution. When a predator hunts, it doesn&#039;t even attempt to attack health prey. Instead, it chooses targets that are sickly or young...<br><br>Obviously this is to their advantage. The elderly or a calf is far less likely to hurt them then a full grown, healthy adult. However, what drives this instinct? Do they just do it without thought, or (and this is my theory) is their a pleasure response associated with killing weak things? What if prey selection had a biological response akin to sex? What if over the years predators evolved to &quot;orgasm&quot; (I use that term figuratively) from killing weak things... Having sex is good for the survival of the species; therefore, your body rewards your mind for it. Killing weak prey instead of healthy prey is good for your own survival; and therefore, the survival of your species. Again, it would make sense if your body rewarded you for &quot;killing kids.&quot;<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Yes, I know it&#039;s fucked up, and I don&#039;t like the idea either...

It was invented by eugenics operatives within the occultic elite to cury Satan&#039;s favor while gaining his protection of their warmaking, usury, currency manipulation, and control over the minds of men.<br>Why is abortion the most powerful form of ritual human sacrifice? Because it entails the most defenseless victims conceivable (the unborn) being murdered by the very persons most duty-bound to love and protect them from harm -- their own mothers, and medical doctors who&#039;ve sworn oaths to their gods to do no harm.<br>These ritual murders which society misnames abortions are, furthermore, carried out in a nonchalant and routinized fashion exclusively to facilitate hedonistic apathy, laziness, and convenience; symbolically placing ten seconds of vaginal pleasure above the value of a human lifetime&#039;s worth of a living, breathing human being&#039;s consciousness.<br>In short, Satan loves abortion because it symbolizes evil within cruelty within evil. It proffers that a few seconds of vaginal contractions mean more than human life itself, and it does this using the greatest symbols of love and compassion (mothers and doctors), satanically inverted into spiritually numbed, unfeeling executioners.<br>So the next time you see a western woman screeching about her abortion rights on the steps of some state capitol, look into her empty eyes and know that you&#039;re seeing more than a simple murderer. Look into her eyes and know that you&#039;re seeing a demon, the very definition of evil. And know that the steady stream of death she inflicts on the unborn is what powers the elite&#039;s satanic karma.","time":1490274713,"resto":117923363,"id":"dsvXWzX6","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":117928756,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)09:12:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117924082\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117924082<\/a><br>If masturbation is genocide then also making babies is, because &#039;they&#039; all can&#039;t win.","time":1490274749,"resto":117923363,"id":"4Mi7oeT2","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":117928782,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)09:12:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117928676\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117928676<\/a><br>as simple as 1+1=2","time":1490274761,"resto":117923363,"id":"6zXNqMox","country":"DZ","country_name":"Algeria"},{"no":117928851,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)09:13:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"Abortion is murder","time":1490274821,"resto":117923363,"id":"2DRZNjx5","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":117928856,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)09:13:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"Only for rape or if there is a serious risk for the mothers life. <br>I could also probably accept if the child would be born with horrible defects that will bring them a lifetime of suffering, or if the parents are like two really stupid and really poor 14-year olds where an unwanted pregnancy would result in massive economic problems for their families.<br><br>Other than that, no.

It was invented by eugenics operatives within the occultic elite to cury Satan&#039;s favor while gaining his protection of their warmaking, usury, currency manipulation, and control over the minds of men.<br><br>Why is abortion the most powerful form of ritual human sacrifice? Because it entails the most defenseless victims conceivable (the unborn) being murdered by the very persons most duty-bound to love and protect them from harm -- their own mothers, and medical doctors who&#039;ve sworn oaths to their gods to do no harm.<br><br>These ritual murders which society misnames abortions are, furthermore, carried out in a nonchalant and routinized fashion exclusively to facilitate hedonistic apathy, laziness, and convenience; symbolically placing ten seconds of vaginal pleasure above the value of a human lifetime&#039;s worth of a living, breathing human being&#039;s consciousness.<br><br>In short, Satan loves abortion because it symbolizes evil within cruelty within evil. It proffers that a few seconds of vaginal contractions mean more than human life itself, and it does this using the greatest symbols of love and compassion (mothers and doctors), satanically inverted into spiritually numbed, unfeeling executioners.<br><br>So the next time you see a western woman screeching about her abortion rights on the steps of some state capitol, look into her empty eyes and know that you&#039;re seeing more than a simple murderer. Look into her eyes and know that you&#039;re seeing a demon, the very definition of evil.

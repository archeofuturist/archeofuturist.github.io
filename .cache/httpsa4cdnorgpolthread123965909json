They started WW1, killing millions of whites, just because they were jealous of the British Empire. Rather comically, they lost the war and lost territory to the British Empire as a result of their ineptitude. Also, unbeknownst to many, the G*rman invented communism and spread it to Russia during the war to weaken them. Eventually, this would kill millions of whites. The G*rman, deeply consumed by shame and anger, sought to re-establish himself as a somewhat relevant regional power. To try and achieve this, they elected a socialist, who fought in the aforementioned war and held a great grudge against the Anglo. In his bitterness, the G*rman created lies about G*rman superiority, to try and justify his lust for power and his neighbours\u2019 lands. Thus war was declared, and with all too much predictability, the G*rman lost another war, with many millions of whites being killed. Again, comically, the G*rman had his own lands taken over by Anglos. The G*rman was defeated. For now. Many years passed, and under the divine mercy of the Anglo, the G*rman was allowed to rebuild, and even to thrive. But the seed of guilt had been implanted in the minds of G*rmans, so as to keep them weak. The G*rman, utterly humiliated, now put his hope in the EU instead of his conquered homeland, and in his autism invited the Middle East to Europe. This was done so that G*rmans could finally live beside a people lower than them. And so it was the G*rman&#039;s blood lust continued, as these new guests killed many whites. But alas, just as the G*rman began to feel a fell hope, the Anglos had defeated them again with Brexit. Who knows what the future holds, but there is one thing certain - the Anglo will always be here to thwart the G*rman menace.","time":1493847266,"resto":123965909,"id":"L0AXOTXo","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123968107,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)17:34:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123965909\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123965909<\/a><br>revisionist history to make yourself feel better about the present situation of some deluded fantasy?<br>fucking amazing.<br><br>this is the current time line.<br><br>may the people responsible for allowing this to occur die in a fucking fire and be roasted over twice in hell for all eternity.","time":1493847272,"resto":123965909,"id":"1T7INVta","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123968143,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)17:34:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123967118\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123967118<\/a><br>how did they find this video?<br>where was this posted?","time":1493847291,"resto":123965909,"id":"DgPTlTjJ","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":123968215,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)17:35:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123965909\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123965909<\/a><br>chromosomes are a spectrum","filename":"bill-nye-wIGnl73l","ext":".jpg","w":1252,"h":1252,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493847322373,"time":1493847322,"md5":"DHE7\/Xuy74G7a\/uvlIqbXQ==","fsize":147098,"resto":123965909,"id":"EX24u\/Km","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":123968271,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)17:35:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123966877\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123966877<\/a><br>wrong<br><a href=\"#p123966594\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123966594<\/a><br>all words are social constructs<br><a href=\"#p123967885\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123967885<\/a><br>leave science creationist scum.","time":1493847347,"resto":123965909,"id":"shPYV8km","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123968367,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)17:36:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123966154\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123966154<\/a><br>It is mainly chromosomes.

Deviations exist, some are advantagious, some are not. Most trans would agree that the mutation that causes their situation to be disadvantagious, but regardless, gender is on a spectrum because evolution is granular. This isn&#039;t pokemon. slow changes aggregate and form the complete picture you view as common, and only the viability of that thing causes it to continue to exist.","time":1493849179,"resto":123965909,"id":"shPYV8km","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123972748,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)18:06:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123965909\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123965909<\/a><br>I PUSH MY FINGERS INTOOOOOOO","filename":"byeByePenis","ext":".png","w":1696,"h":855,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":63,"tim":1493849186872,"time":1493849186,"md5":"Pn+DkbaDCxjfmICuLKMN0g==","fsize":1483351,"resto":123965909,"id":"y0h3kSos","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":123972764,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)18:06:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123971349\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123971349<\/a><br>We&#039;re all experts here, anon.","filename":"1485819850021","ext":".png","w":2560,"h":1440,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1493849195013,"time":1493849195,"md5":"WsHVXxG+HLEwtcTX4WXNCw==","fsize":2625844,"resto":123965909,"id":"f0u+s8dO","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":123972767,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)18:06:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123966154\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123966154<\/a><br>Now we are heavily invested in the semantics game.<br><br>Can someone tell me what word accurately describes someone who has XX chromosomes and someone with XY chromosomes?<br><br>Or how about a human being who is capable of producing sperm and one capable of producing eggs?","time":1493849197,"resto":123965909,"id":"RPhBPqZo","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123972882,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)18:07:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123972359\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123972359<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Yes, with enough effort, anyone can become innately convinced of any wild or bizarre idea.

Let&#039;s look at your scientific angle first. <br><br>1. The fact that .5% (and that&#039;s a generous figure there) MIGHT be non-binary is not enough to invalidate the other 99.5% of people, and falls well within the margin of error. There is a preponderance of evidence TOWARDS the binary, not against it.<br><br>2. Claiming biological &quot;evolution&quot; as a factor in the sudden &quot;invalidation&quot; of the binary is also silly. Firstly, people with intersex\/non-binary chromosomes can&#039;t be considered another sex. Often, people with Klinefelter&#039;s or Turner&#039;s syndrome are classified as abnormal male or abnormal female respectively, and cannot be considered &quot;evolutionary&quot; insofar as they progress the supposed evolutionary progress of the human race. Both cases are infertile and suffer major health defects due to having an extra X or Y chromosome.<br><br>3. Biological Evolution does contain examples of near static evolutionary progress, and this does not invalidate the theory of Evolution. Crocodiles, Horseshoe Crabs, and other biological relics from millions of years ago do not suddenly invalidate the fact that things do evolve. If we were to go by your metric (less than 1% of a sample size being enough to disprove a theory), then we might as well throw out Evolution and therefore your claims about how this is presents an incongruity.<br><br>4. And last and certainly least, from the PoMo kids themselves, (((Gender Is A Social Construct))). It&#039;s an unfalsifiable, non-biological, illogical ideology and methodology.","time":1493849259,"resto":123965909,"id":"K9GJl6vZ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123973018,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)18:08:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123972195\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123972195<\/a><br><br>There&#039;s no real flawless human example as if we all came to existence on a factory conveyor belt.

Not in the UK, but two in Thailand, one in Spain and one in Brazil.<br><br>I ended up living with the Brazilian one. I&#039;d acquired a taste for it by then and was in a pretty dark place. No opiates for me, mostly mild weed and strong cocaine but she was using needles quite frequently. She was probably the best looking and most convincing of the bunch, though, so I didn&#039;t mind. After a while she stopped charging me for sex and we lived in together, having sex at least five times a day. I told her that I loved her and I would take her back to the UK. At this point I realised what kind of mess I got myself in, so when she was at the supermarket one morning I stole all her money, her phone and her passport and got out of there. Locked the door, pocketed the keys and ran for it. I put the passport in the cistern of a toilet in a bar in the next town, put the keys down a giant hole that I randomly came across in the street and sold her phone after crushing the SD card to some fat kid.

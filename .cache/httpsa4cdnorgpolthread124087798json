Life will go on as usual, the GOP holds the whip hand an they can wait out any attempt by democrats to throw a tantrum yet they caved because they&#039;re spineless cucks.<br><br>Oh yeah, and they also just passed Obamacare Lite. After 8 years of doing nothing about it, they finally replace it with basically more of the same just slightly different. All endorsed by Trump, of course.<br><br>Honestly it is pathetic to read all the justifications on this board. You&#039;re all cucks.

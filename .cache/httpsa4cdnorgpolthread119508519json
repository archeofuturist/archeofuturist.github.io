The MSM is continually running itself into corners. It&#039;s like a game of Go, and they can&#039;t see the ladders. Because of prior reporting, they have to accept this story. But in acknowledging Tillerson&#039;s response they do two really big things: they weaken the Trump-Russia narrative and they call attention to the fact that there have been two other attacks in the past month, and even more the further you extend the timeline. This in turn Strengthens Trumps campaign messaging that Obama was weak and failed the middle east. People remember the &quot;Red Line&quot;. In fact, CNN has already reported on the White House placing some blame on the Obama administration for letting this go on.<br><br>Importantly, Trump is not pro-rebel\/pro-ISIS. This inclines Russia to try and work with the US in resolving the crisis, which as many have pointed out, is already progressing quickly in favor of the Syrian government. Don&#039;t forget that Trump met with Al-Sisi today, and is about to meet the King of Jordan. If Russia is innocent, it won&#039;t take much for them to produce the evidence, and the MSM will have no way left of twisting it. This gives the US a strong coalition for eliminating ISIS and Al-Qaeda from the Middle East, without relying on the Iraqi government, or having to put many boots on the ground. It also lets Iraq have more self-determination, which further paints Trump as the good guy. <br><br>You see a crisis.

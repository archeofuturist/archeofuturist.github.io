These are more fit for our consumption than the non-redpilled. I really need to familiarze myself with photoshop. If the object is to get them questioning modernity and progressive values, then I think there are two strong entry level methods.<br><br>1. The failed hopes and dreams, as outlined in the OP, contrasted with today&#039;s reality. A simple visual example might be a landscape format split, on one half showing jetpacks and flying cars with all the filters of the neo-80&#039;s aesthetic, then slowly fading through static effects to the modern era, showing that as only the daydream of a person trapped in our mundane society.<br><br>2. A cyberpunk fixation on censorship, and dystopic themes (pic related). The progressive dogma stifles free speech, a noble idea and part of American heritage, and the democratic party has become the party of mass surveillance. Paint us as living on the cusp of the dark cyberpunk future of Blade Runner and other dystopic works, with less cool tech and just as much surveillance. it is hard not to do this without a sense of fatalism, though.<br><br>3. Similarly in line with flaunting the dystopic cyberpunk theme, I think we need to focus on how the progressive agenda has undermined non-controversial western values. Freedom of speech, equality under the law, the management of the government by the elite, the illuminati, etc.<br><br>I&#039;ve been engineering a setting which features an 80&#039;s revival in reaction to increasingly dystopic measures and a broader sense of nihilism. But that could be reapplied here. The trick is that if we want this to go viral, it has to be palatable. People have been so indoctrinated that they&#039;ll immediately spit out whatever lines about race are fed to them. Only when we get them to question their indoctrinators in other areas first, can we move forward with race. At that point, they will be open to new information.","filename":"14c0b441e6026d6fcd8427d0695e8422-d5dzzmv","ext":".jpg","w":1000,"h":1143,"tn_w":109,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490731892165,"time":1490731892,"md5":"ei1s7mC4ft9uc6Q6vNFYiA==","fsize":869524,"resto":118673726,"id":"wio+VedE","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":118690436,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)16:15:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"Finally I can drop some FW","filename":"FV OC","ext":".png","w":1266,"h":1280,"tn_w":123,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490732100292,"time":1490732100,"md5":"Xoz9KA1yHhK4If\/Q1MMkKA==","fsize":3523423,"resto":118673726,"id":"KsXXmv02","country":"ES","m_img":1,"country_name":"Spain"},{"no":118690645,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)16:16:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118682613\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118682613<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;stop digging this hole.

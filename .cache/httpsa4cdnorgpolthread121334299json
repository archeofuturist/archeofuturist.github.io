If approved, the office of the Prime Minister would be abolished and the existing parliamentary system of government would be replaced with an executive presidency and a presidential system. The number of seats in Parliament would be raised from 550 to 600 while the president would be given more control over appointments to the Supreme Board of Judges and Prosecutors (HSYK). The referendum will be held under a state of emergency that was declared following a failed military coup attempt in July 2016.&quot;","filename":"589ee8c40f25449f7c642655[1]","ext":".jpg","w":590,"h":332,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1492328697822,"time":1492328697,"md5":"0ge\/bzuITaG+qMK1fnpWhA==","fsize":20882,"resto":0,"id":"nKLtYl40","country":"TR","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"turkish-referandum-general","country_name":"Turkey","replies":22,"images":2,"unique_ips":14},{"no":121334609,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)03:50:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"How much vote fraud is to be expected?","time":1492329032,"resto":121334299,"id":"EFbVTlIz","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":121334878,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)03:55:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121334609\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121334609<\/a><br>Fraud would be likely, but opposition is vigilant than ever now<br>One NGO even created app for it in case it&#039;ll happens","time":1492329330,"resto":121334299,"id":"nKLtYl40","country":"TR","country_name":"Turkey"},{"no":121335143,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)04:00:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;a referendum about sanctioning a dictatorship<\/span><br><br>What even?

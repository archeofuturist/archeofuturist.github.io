Voting was regulated to men because the perspective was: Women are emotional, generally naive, self centered and focus on generally trivialities that do not affect our society in the long run, men are the opposite of that and those that aren&#039;t fall by the wayside quickly, letting the &quot;strong destroy the weak&quot; method to play out.

In the last year I&#039;ve managed to finally save up a bit. I had some student debt that I payed off, and I bought my first car, a cheap used car. I&#039;ve got about 7,800 usd now. I&#039;m thinking perhaps I should do something. I&#039;ve been thinking I should broaden my horizon by traveling to eastern europe for a week this summer. Maybe I&#039;ll buy some clothes because I literally have like one pair of jeans and one black hoodie that I wear all the time. Any other suggestions of things I might do that are useful or good for self-improvement?","filename":"1478271824249","ext":".png","w":208,"h":206,"tn_w":208,"tn_h":206,"tim":1490884795645,"time":1490884795,"md5":"hvvVedE5KTN2kF5DbLfy\/Q==","fsize":114765,"resto":0,"id":"QAPZ9VqG","country":"SE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"finally-got-a-little-bit-of-money-what-do","country_name":"Sweden","replies":18,"images":4,"unique_ips":9},{"no":118926471,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)10:41:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"Don&#039;t spend money.","filename":"vorg","ext":".png","w":208,"h":206,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":123,"tim":1490884868293,"time":1490884868,"md5":"egjz1VpfEN5U+6luugRpqA==","fsize":90900,"resto":118926370,"id":"d2l970CY","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":118926739,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)10:43:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"The point of saving money is to not spend money.

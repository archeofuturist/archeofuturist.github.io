Whether it&#039;s actually true doesn&#039;t matter so much as that people as a whole believe it to be true and take seriously the morals and values that the religion instills on society. Religion, as a meme in the academic sense, is eugenic. You can tell by the fact that every society has either formed or adopted a religion.

You remember watchmen, right?

It doesn&#039;t MATTER that there isn&#039;t REALLY an alien threat against Earth. What matters is that the BELIEF that it&#039;s true has caused the world to unite peacefully rather than edge toward nuclear war.

Made me realize that I had been taking Communion unworthily and giving incomplete confessions for several years. I fortunately learned and basically did a general confession (looking back at that moment) with the priest who showed me my errors. Since then I will only receive in a state of grace. It bugs me that people not in a state of grace are still getting Communion, my family included, but my voice does not get heard or even respected. I couldn&#039;t bring the college religious friends\/groups support with me once I graduated. The hierarchy has become more incompetent by the year, the subversion hasn&#039;t stopped one bit, the funds are still going to questionable charities, the parish left me spiritually malnourished, the family is culturally Catholic but the hypocrisy keeps the situation from improving, and nearly one year from my graduation I find myself becoming a more jobless and godless shut-in man who finds myself practicing it less and less but knows better than to commit sacrilege. <br><br>Still regard it as Truth despite the predicament that is my own hypocritical spiritual state.

Why the fuck should the taxpayer pay the government to pay insurance companies to pay for the taxpayer when they get sick, it boggles the fucking mind. If the government gave two shits about providing health care, they would have federally run hospitals where you can get your stitches and shit on the cheap. But they don&#039;t, so you pay people to pay other people to pay for you (or your neighbors) in case you get sick.<br><br>2) Patent law is fucking horrible and anti-competitive. This is the reason the market is so bad, companies get rights to medicine for like 25-50 fucking years. There&#039;s only so many ways to brew insulin, and this drives the price up. If patent law for medical technology and medicine was changed to be a 5 year exclusive patent followed by a requirement to put the patent on the market (and sold at a value based on how profitable it was during the previous 5 years) then companies would rush to flood the market with as much of their product as possible during the years they had exclusive rights. This would significantly lower prices.<br><br>3) With obamacare there is no opt out, and thus people get stuck paying for shit they don&#039;t use when they could just save the money for themselves.","time":1490424457,"resto":118195646,"id":"N3KTBfVN","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118197399,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)02:48:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118197286\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118197286<\/a><br>Based leaf is correct , our system is fucking cancer","time":1490424538,"resto":118195646,"id":"1F1wgaHX","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118197445,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)02:49:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118195646\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118195646<\/a><br>tfw no bionacle","time":1490424579,"resto":118195646,"id":"wq0hfc\/j","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118197842,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)02:54:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118196706\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118196706<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;t. drumpf<\/span>","time":1490424897,"resto":118195646,"id":"BtTR4NP1","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118199919,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)03:23:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118197286\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118197286<\/a><br>To address point 1, the government gets to flex and talk down the prices similar to how the insurance companies handle things.

Elected state&#039;s chief justice in 2000, he installed a granite monument depicting the Ten Commandments in the Heflin-Torbert Judicial Building in Montgomery. The move led to controversies and additional legal action. When U.S. District Judge Myron Thompson ordered the monument removed, Moore refused to obey. That led to charges against Moore and, eventually, his removal from the bench in 2003.<br><br>After two unsuccessful campaigns for governor, Moore won re-election as chief justice in 2012. In Jan. 2016, Moore circulated an order telling probate judges not to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. The order, largely ignored, flew in the face of the U.S. Supreme Court&#039;s 2015 ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges striking down state bans on same-sex marriage.<br><br>Following complaints, the Judicial Inquiry Commission filed charges against Moore last May, leading to his automatic suspension from the bench. Moore accused LGBT groups of conspiring to remove him, but his attorneys in court took a more moderate tone, arguing Moore&#039;s order was meant as guidance and did not change the status quo on same-sex marriage. The Court of the Judiciary disagreed, and suspended Moore for the remainder of his term in September.","filename":"RoyMoore","ext":".jpg","w":777,"h":437,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1493253720298,"time":1493253720,"md5":"QsKulnwGeLggzE0NiktNBQ==","fsize":41102,"resto":0,"id":"89Kle337","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"alabaman-former-supreme-court-chief-running-for","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":122967135,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)20:43:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122966913\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122966913<\/a><br>Yes, 100%.

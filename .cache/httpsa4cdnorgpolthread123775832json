Rothbard apparently had extensive discussions with Georgists:<br><br>If every man owns his own person and therefore his own labor, and if by extension he owns whatever property he has &quot;created&quot; or gathered out of the previously unused, unowned &quot;state of nature,&quot; then what of the last great question: the right to own or control the earth itself? ... It is at this point that Henry George and his followers, who have gone all the way so far with the libertarians, leave the track and deny the individual right to own the piece of land itself, the ground on which these activities have taken place.

(If walking over some land constitutes transformation and use, then is it just one&#039;s footprints that one owns? Or does one&#039;s rightful claim extend out to all the underbrush one has cleared away? Or, can one claim land as far as the eye can see? This is the very definition of the word &quot;arbitrary.&quot;) But in his defense, to convert the claim into actual ownership would, Rothbard would say, require actual use (though we&#039;re again faced with the question of what constitutes &quot;use&quot; -- see p. 79, &quot;Anti-Rothbard...&quot;). For example, earlier, in a Robinson Crusoe paradigm, he stated that Crusoe&#039;s &quot;true property--his actual control over material goods--would extend only so far as his actual labor brought them into production. His true ownership could not extend beyond the power of his own reach.&quot;<br><br>What, then, would Rothbard say about large American corporations owning, but not using, millions of acres of land, as some now do? He gives us his answer in an essay he wrote on Henry George&#039;s Land Value Tax idea, entitled &quot;The Single Tax: Economic and Moral Implications&quot; (FEE &quot;Special Essay Series,&quot; 1957).

The SCS man-made island dispute is a good example of this; in contrast to the USA, which will make public statements when it builds bases overseas of commitment to national security or our allies, China has categorically denied that it is building those islands. China will make announcements when it has developed in defensive things, or will conduct\/has conducted exercises, but they won&#039;t discuss offensive maneuvers because they can&#039;t be a victim when they are the aggressor.<br><br>For this large deployment force, China is denying it altogether. What this means is it is not a defensive posture. If it were defensive, China would have held a press conference stating their intentions like they have for all other defensive postures and maneuvers. Until they state their intentions, this troop movement falls exactly in line with their current approach to offensive maneuvers. 100%.<br><br>So what is the motive? You can rule out that it&#039;s strictly defensive, like the guess that the intention is to receive NK refugees. There is at least a much more significant, ulterior motive; if they could play the victim at least reasonably, they would. But it&#039;s obvious from their total silence and denial that it&#039;s aggressive. You can actually rule out altogether that China is preparing to defend its border from an influx of US troops too. The most likely reason for this deployment, one that would fall in line with their stated-victimhood, silent-power strategy, is that China is unable to predict Trump, so they assume the worst and have positioned troops there for an invasion from the north into NK.<br>(1\/2)","time":1491922613,"resto":120606752,"id":"Kli0FP1C","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120606892,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)10:57:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"Who \/not with trump\/ here?","time":1491922631,"resto":120606752,"id":"SbQzaQ1c","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120606899,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)10:57:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"Reminder that GAssad is our enemy and was put there by the communists from the USSR","time":1491922633,"resto":120606752,"id":"Tl9eFNGT","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":120606905,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)10:57:15","name":"Anonymous","filename":"sketch-1491917986068-1","ext":".jpg","w":720,"h":897,"tn_w":100,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491922635325,"time":1491922635,"md5":"KFVOK2P+uPK6lMUiGuwHbg==","fsize":110705,"resto":120606752,"id":"g52MjJ4d","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120606912,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)10:57:17","name":"Anonymous","filename":"1490676028026","ext":".jpg","w":707,"h":1000,"tn_w":88,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491922637851,"time":1491922637,"md5":"kc2+VRANIdHzW\/hpLfPkbw==","fsize":300424,"resto":120606752,"id":"LVrRdjxo","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120606914,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)10:57:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"Could one of you rural and suburban retards explain to me this graph in pic related?<br><br>have some of your favorite music to go with it<br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=p1o<wbr>L37ycONQ","filename":"file","ext":".png","w":633,"h":626,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":123,"tim":1491922640372,"time":1491922640,"md5":"+fsJsv\/0iYrqcDmHuA3fSg==","fsize":131072,"resto":120606752,"id":"h5iY9LUX","country":"RO","country_name":"Romania"},{"no":120606916,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)10:57:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"kike puppet","filename":"1491542324979","ext":".png","w":294,"h":449,"tn_w":81,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491922640356,"time":1491922640,"md5":"RZMf+hwdr7GwqRtFPVOWvg==","fsize":104627,"resto":120606752,"id":"Al85dY3T","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120606939,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)10:57:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"tl;dr<br><br>Don&#039;t waste your time","time":1491922659,"resto":120606752,"id":"EHq+qWR4","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120606953,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)10:57:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"(2\/2)<br>This invasion could come before or after an attack from the US. If China handles NK before we attack- because China anticipates our attack- not only do they reap the benefits of controlling NK (annexation and forced integration, like Hong Kong), they gain leverage in future trade deals with the US (because they &quot;solved&quot; the NK problem without American intervention, and &#039;you scratch my back...&#039;).<br><br>If China waits for the US to strike, they will invade after us and be looking to divvy up NK, similar to Germany at the end of WW2 being cut into West and East Germany. They want a piece of the pie. This option, of waiting for the US, also gives them their victimhood angle- in order to protect from the US doing anything bad for China, they invade to be a part of the negotiations. Waiting with troops deployed at the border can also give China the &#039;strategic deterrence&#039; angle that would give China international legitimacy and some wiggle room for militarizing the SCS.<br><br>In summary, this is wholly an aggressive posture, and we know this because they have denied it entirely. If it was to receive refugees, like clueless people are suggesting, they would have played the American aggression, pure defense angle. But they&#039;re not, in line with their current approach to all other issues.

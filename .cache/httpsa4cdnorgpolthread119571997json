You must be successful, reliable, hardworking, and, above all, happy. Do people in your life trust and respect you? What does your family think of you? Racial politics doesn\u2019t have to be the only factor of that. If you can\u2019t achieve these things in your real life, then you are not ready to be a political activist, either anonymously or in reality.<br><br>Always remember: we live in first world countries and have opportunity that most people born on this planet don\u2019t. So work your ass off, every day, to build a good life for yourself. How can you help others when you can\u2019t help yourself? Spend your time wisely, and keep your real life priorities in order. Nothing on the internet should ever take away from your real life.","filename":"1490164300128","ext":".jpg","w":533,"h":800,"tn_w":166,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491370101072,"time":1491370101,"md5":"R9L2v1geaarpCd1i2RKNYg==","fsize":114991,"resto":0,"id":"3XrtySpG","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-most-important-thing-you-can-do-for-the-white","country_name":"United States","replies":12,"images":0,"unique_ips":8},{"no":119572121,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)01:29:40","name":"Tar Heel","com":"<a href=\"#p119571997\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119571997<\/a><br><br>Dad, get off 4chan.","time":1491370180,"resto":119571997,"id":"0fxXQaIX","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119572148,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)01:29:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119571997\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119571997<\/a><br>I love big soft white breast.","time":1491370192,"resto":119571997,"id":"gokSezSk","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119572255,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)01:30:54","name":"Tar Heel","com":"<a href=\"#p119572148\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119572148<\/a><br><br>But did you work hard for that titty, son?

Don&#039;t let me catch you at (((Starbucks))). <br> <br>2) Don&#039;t agree to do &quot;small favors&quot; for people you don&#039;t want to associate with. Foot in the door phenomenon. Ahmed asks you in class, &quot;do you have a piece of paper?&quot; No. No you don&#039;t. Even looking at too many faces from a certain population will make you accustomed to them and will make you favor them unconsciously. But this is irrelevant drivel and you should leave it to the psychology majors. Just physically distance yourself, and don&#039;t do it in a suspicious or obvious way. <br><br>3) It will be easier for your distant descendants to shift their ideology than their location. Move to a geographical location where you wouldn&#039;t mind being related to a random sample of the population in a few millennium.","time":1491371464,"resto":119571997,"id":"beV7x0+C","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119574249,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)01:53:43","name":"Tar Heel","com":"<a href=\"#p119574025\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119574025<\/a><br><br>I agree that your average \/pol\/ user requires some inspiration, though.

Before to be transgender you had to know you were a woman. You had to go and take psychological evaluations to confirm that this was 100% what was going on. You had to spend time dressing and living as a woman. Then when it was deemed that everything was legit after like months or a year of living like that then you were given your hormones and other shit. I know this because I knew a tranny and this is how everything went for them and this was a rich person from Commiefornia mind you. This was also only a decade ago.<br><br>But since the spectrum--all your genderqueer and genderfuck and what have you--nonsense got popularized over the last few years none of that matters nor is it required. You&#039;re a guy who likes to wear dresses? Where previously we would&#039;ve labelled you a transvestite and an almost assuredly sexually degenerate weirdo, now you&#039;re &quot;genderqueer&quot;; no effort in appearing or acting feminine. Put on a sundress, some leggings, boots and go out looking like you stepped out of the garbage pile of Eddie Izzard&#039;s mentally deranged clone and you&#039;re a transwoman as good as any other.<br><br>You&#039;re a girl who likes typically masculine things? You&#039;re a girl who wears boy hair cuts and dresses in boy clothes? No longer are you a tomboy or a bulldyke, you get to join in on the transgender fun. You&#039;re a boy who played with Barbie dolls once when you were 3? You&#039;re really a girl deep down and are a tranny too... even though gender roles and preferences aren&#039;t real of course so then playing with dolls shouldn&#039;t mean shit.<br><br>The spectrum is such a wide, poorly defined net that it becomes easy to get caught in it and when you have the media pushing transgenderism as something noble that makes you cool and unique, no shit kids and teenagers will be attracted to it.

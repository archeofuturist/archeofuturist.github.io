So what do you mean it &quot;survived more&quot;?<br><br>Scientific advancement is not unique to capitalism, nor is capitalism an ideal condition for such advancements.

Science is the process of failing over and over until you get something right. It&#039;s rare that entrepreneurs and CEOs want to fund that kind of thing because it&#039;s extremely risky.

He praised them often in his journal, and some of his friends grew irritated at his frequent Nazi salutes and quotations in the months leading up to the shooting. At a certain point, Harris realized he needed to reduce this behavior, for fear of revealing his plans. He commented in his journal about how hard it was to wait until April to express all his hatred for the human race.[28] In his journal, Harris mentioned his admiration of what he imagined to be natural selection, and wrote that he would like to put everyone in a super Doom game and see to it that the weak die and the strong live.[23] On the day of the massacre, Harris wore a white T-shirt with the words &quot;Natural selection&quot; printed in black.[16]<\/span><br><br>Were they \/our guys\/?","time":1490476008,"resto":118262632,"id":"ziJ2HKJb","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"},{"no":118272369,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)17:07:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118269072\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118269072<\/a><br>Who&#039;s going to pay for those?

All school shooters are essentially the human equivalent of a cornered omega wolf that is turned on by the whole pack, so all it can do is lash out with disproportional violence, except unlike the omega wolf they aren&#039;t actually in any danger of being torn apart, they are just exaggerating their situation due to their mental weakness. This might also be unavoidable altogether. This might just be the result of regular dysgenics in society due to the lack of natural selection and a growing population, creating unstable and useless males.","time":1490482777,"resto":118262632,"id":"V+BczxRk","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118285290,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)19:01:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118282426\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118282426<\/a><br>This.

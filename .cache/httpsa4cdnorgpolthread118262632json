He praised them often in his journal, and some of his friends grew irritated at his frequent Nazi salutes and quotations in the months leading up to the shooting. At a certain point, Harris realized he needed to reduce this behavior, for fear of revealing his plans. He commented in his journal about how hard it was to wait until April to express all his hatred for the human race.[28] In his journal, Harris mentioned his admiration of what he imagined to be natural selection, and wrote that he would like to put everyone in a super Doom game and see to it that the weak die and the strong live.[23] On the day of the massacre, Harris wore a white T-shirt with the words &quot;Natural selection&quot; printed in black.[16]<\/span><br><br>Were they \/our guys\/?","time":1490476008,"resto":118262632,"id":"ziJ2HKJb","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"},{"no":118272369,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)17:07:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118269072\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118269072<\/a><br>Who&#039;s going to pay for those?

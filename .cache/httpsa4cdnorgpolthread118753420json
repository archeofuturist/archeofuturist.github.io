PLEASE INCLUDE SOURCES FOR YOUR VIEWPOINT. Example (people who watch satire news are actually on average more knowledgeable than people who watch news like CNN and Fox): http:\/\/www.people-press.org\/2007\/04<wbr>\/15\/public-knowledge-of-current-aff<wbr>airs-little-changed-by-news-and-inf<wbr>ormation-revolutions\/ You can also list events. Must have factual information, or use a famous author\/philosopher&#039;s quote. Something you could cite in an essay, not just talking out your butthole.","filename":"pigs in hats","ext":".png","w":629,"h":616,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":244,"tim":1490766313810,"time":1490766313,"md5":"qGDpQRg1N\/bzJ3JzWgOwKg==","fsize":427930,"resto":0,"id":"RjMlP+oy","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-role-of-satire","country_name":"United States","replies":5,"images":1,"unique_ips":4},{"no":118753595,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)01:47:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118753420\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118753420<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Something you could cite in an essay<\/span><br>I&#039;m onto your tricks kike","filename":"3rdbogdanoff","ext":".jpg","w":450,"h":301,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1490766444575,"time":1490766444,"md5":"QxtTeqZe91Mgkij+NFnbgg==","fsize":21128,"resto":118753420,"id":"N6ZpN8xB","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118753598,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)01:47:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118753420\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118753420<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;420<\/span><br>still not doing your homework though. satire is faggotry when you actually believe the horseshit you spout.","time":1490766445,"resto":118753420,"id":"AkjqWJMf","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118753794,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)01:50:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118753595\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118753595<\/a><br>Oh come on.

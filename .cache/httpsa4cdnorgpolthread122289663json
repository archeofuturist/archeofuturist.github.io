The fact is the US has been declining for over 50 years since the 1965 Immigration Act and the civil rights movement and feminism, and Trump is the first President since then who is successfully reversing the decline with all the executive orders he&#039;s signed, his SC nomination, and his phone calls to corporations to bring jobs back to America. The truth is Trump is keeping his promise to focus on deporting violent illegals, even though I don&#039;t agree with it, so don&#039;t fall for the obvious divide-and-conquer shilling about flip-flopping, or think that this changes all the good Trump&#039;s already done with the EOs and SC. Trump isn&#039;t the final solution to the globalist question, but he&#039;s pointing us in the right direction, until someone else comes along who will take us even farther in that direction.

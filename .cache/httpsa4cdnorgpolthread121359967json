Look at \/pol\/, people from all social classes, ethnicities, religions etc come together and look what a bunch of neets already accomplished.<br>Its just that you dont get diversity by throwing together everything and mix it.

This is what destroys diversity. <br>\/pol\/, without realizing fights for the upholding of cultural diversity across the world by letting them seperate and trying to make them value their heritage.

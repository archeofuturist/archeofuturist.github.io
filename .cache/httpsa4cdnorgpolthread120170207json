Many of those killed were leaders of the Sturmabteilung (SA), the best-known victim was Ernst R\u00f6hm, the SA&#039;s leader and one of Hitler&#039;s longtime supporters and allies. Leading members of the left-wing Strasserist faction of the NSDAP, along with its figurehead, Gregor Strasser, were also killed, as were prominent conservative anti-Nazis such as former Chancellor Kurt von Schleicher and Gustav Ritter von Kahr, who had suppressed Adolf Hitler&#039;s Beer Hall Putsch in 1923. Does this look like a peaceful way of conflict-solving to you?<br><br>Adolf Hitler has had a long trail of blood covered by telling lies to the public. From re-militarizing the entire nation, over claiming German Volksgenossen residing in north-western Czechia (Sudetenland) were being systematically mistreated to the point that annexation or war were the ONLY options; to getting Austria &quot;Heim ins Reich&quot; (and erasing the entire nation&#039;s 900 year identity by calling it Ostmark henceforth including even renaming two of its states, Ober\u00f6sterreich and Nieder\u00f6sterreich to Oberdonau and Niederdonau), historians can list you a long list of demagoguery that would be too long for this post. Encouraged by the passivity of Britain and France (Hitler-Appeasement policy), he wiped yet another nation off the map, namely Czechia, and eventually set his eyes on reclaiming East Prussian territories lost after WW1, including the city of Danzig and the corridor bearing the same name. <br><br>Cont.","filename":"1488661898973","ext":".jpg","w":736,"h":974,"tn_w":94,"tn_h":124,"tim":1491679596318,"time":1491679596,"md5":"VqKbDKV1z31\/HH25PcUVRg==","fsize":208943,"resto":120170207,"id":"bglzQHbQ","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"},{"no":120170846,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)15:27:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120170731\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120170731<\/a><br>Let&#039;s not forget Hitler&#039;s involvement in the Spanish Civil War, especially the bombing of Guernica (a Basque civilian town) under the code name Operation R\u00fcgen on April 26, 1937, during which German Luftwaffe planes (part of the Condor Legion) violated the Kriegsv\u00f6lkerrecht, international laws of armed conflict.

Why? They&#039;re on the other end of the world, a beyond useless trade partner especially during wartime, so what practical use could an alliance such as this have after the war had started, given that Hitler had already defeated France and sent the British Army across Dunkirk by June 1940? The only logic is if Hitler were following an expansionist geopolitical strategy, specifically in trying to open an eastern front in the Soviet Union (whose western flank he was to invade without warning in summer 1941). The alliance with Japan after WW2 had started is also a slap in the face to any revisionist who insists Germany did not have any international interests, and was only seeking to secure a future for her own people.<br><br>And speaking of Dunkirk, another revisionist fairy tale is that Hitler halted the Wehrmacht&#039;s advance to spare the lives of the British trapped on the beach, as a show of compassion with which he hoped Britain would see reason and accept peace terms. In reality, it was Von Rundstedt and Kluge who ordered the advance halted, primarily because the advancing tanks had overextended themselves, the terrain was marshy, the armor was valuable and still needed for the final assault on France, and G\u00f6ring had assured Hitler that his Luftwaffe could deal with the stragglers on the beach.","time":1491680221,"resto":120170207,"id":"bglzQHbQ","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"},{"no":120172175,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)15:37:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120171860\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120171860<\/a><br>Daily reminder that Hitler is the true reason for the Muslim hordes in Europe.

Stalin did, and how did history reward him for trusting Hitler? Operation Barbarossa, the largest motorized land invasion in the history of mankind that ended up costing over 20 million Soviet lives, and two poorly sourced novels trying to make a quick buck off people 50 years later claiming Hitler&#039;s goal of destroying &quot;Judeo-Bolshevism&quot; was but a pre-emptive strike to an invasion of Europe planned by Stalin.

Let me begin by saying the Soviet Union was not part of the Allied powers until Operation Barbarossa, so &quot;letting an allied power get away with something&quot; is not the answer. Rather, given that Britain and France had already committed themselves to war with a European superpower and Poland was all but overrun, it would have made little sense to declare war on the largest nation on the planet on top of that as well. A bit like committing to challenging a 6 foot bully to a fist-fight but realizing there&#039;s an 8 foot bully nearby beating someone else up as well.

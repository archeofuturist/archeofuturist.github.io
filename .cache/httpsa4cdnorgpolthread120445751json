She was 34 years old. Swanson championed the notion that weight and health have no inherent connection. She enjoyed dying her hair bright colors, wearing glasses and dating African American men.<br><br>\u201cIt\u2019s not that I\u2019m thin-phobic,\u201d she once told an audience on a college campus. \u201cIt\u2019s just that curvy women have been enslaved and victimized by capitalists for far too long and yeah, I\u2019m upset.\u201d<br><br>Swanson was born the middle of five children to a working class family in rural West Virginia. She was overweight as a child, and by her senior year of high school weighed over 350 pounds. She would later describe her teenage years as the most difficult period of her life.<br><br>\u201cPeople can be so intolerant of others,\u201d she later wrote. \u201cMy classmates were such judgmental, privileged assholes.\u201d","filename":"tmp_32165-DEAD-FAT-ACCEPTANCE-554700876","ext":".jpg","w":728,"h":401,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":137,"tim":1491836286217,"time":1491836286,"md5":"9giWjXOCzJJB1v0fd8Bupw==","fsize":110579,"resto":0,"id":"qaUTYY0n","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"fat-acceptance-activist-dead-from-heart-attack-at","country_name":"United States","replies":47,"images":13,"unique_ips":42},{"no":120445880,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)10:59:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120445751\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120445751<\/a><br>In college, Swanson found acceptance among a group of intersectional feminists. \u201cFirst I learned to love myself, and that helped me become a happier person. Then I learned about white supremacy and thin privilege, and I got pissed.\u201d<br><br>After finishing college, Swanson moved into a studio apartment. She had trouble securing a full-time job due to \u201csystemic ableism,\u201d so she started a blog. Within a year, she had attracted a worldwide audience. Swanson became a big voice in the fat acceptance community, where she sought to raise awareness about the impact of fat phobia, which includes expressing concern over someone\u2019s size (\u201cconcern trolling\u201c) or associating obesity with health issues.<br><br>\u201cI don\u2019t want to compare struggles, but Harriet Tubman fought a similar battle,\u201d Swanson once told a reporter. \u201cWomen in larger bodies are seriously underrepresented among athletes and models. Oppression and discrimination are the only logical reasons why this is occurring.\u201d<br><br>Some doctors, who Swanson called \u201cpsychological terrorists,\u201d affirmed her message of self-acceptance but warned about the practice of endorsing unhealthy body types amidst skyrocketing obesity rates. Additional concerns were raised about the fat acceptance movement\u2019s use of dangerously unscientific or misrepresented concepts, like the belief that weight and health have no clear relationship. The promotion of obesity, some have said, is no different than advocating for anorexia.","time":1491836371,"resto":120445751,"id":"qaUTYY0n","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120445916,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)10:59:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120445751\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120445751<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Marge Swanson<\/span><br><br>that&#039;s not her","time":1491836397,"resto":120445751,"id":"xIkOU6mp","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120445954,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)11:00:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120445880\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120445880<\/a><br>\u201cWhen people learn that I\u2019m 412 pounds, they assume that means I\u2019m inactive or unhealthy,\u201d she wrote in her blog last year. \u201cI\u2019m actually one of the most health conscious people you\u2019ll ever meet.

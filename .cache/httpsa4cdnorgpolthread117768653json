Atheism is in decline worldwide, with the number of atheists falling from 4.5% of the world&#039;s population in 1970 to 2.0% in 2010 and projected to drop to 1.8% by 2020, <br><br>Real surveys and statistics say atheism is on the decline worldwide. Sorry atheists but atheism is not on the rise nor is it winning. It&#039;s still the minority and a declining one at that. <br><br>The Pew Research Center&#039;s statistics show that atheism is expected to continue to decline all the way into 2050 with a continued growth of religion. Other research also shows a huge surge in growth for Christianity in China which is currently the world&#039;s most &quot;atheist&quot; nation because of the atheist communist government suppressing religion, the research suggests that China will soon become the world&#039;s most Christian nation within 15 years. <br><br>This is simply history repeating itself: Christianity prospered in Rome back in the ancient era when it was suppressed and it still grew in the militant atheist soviet Russia when it was suppressed there only a century ago with the majority of Russians today now also identifying as Christian. Just goes to show that atheist suppression of religion still doesn&#039;t stop religion.<br><br>Sources for the legion of whiny \/Redditor\/ fedoras that will no doubt show up it this thread:<br><br>http:\/\/www.pewforum.org\/2015\/04\/02\/<wbr>religious-projections-2010-2050\/<br>http:\/\/www.pewforum.org\/2012\/12\/18\/<wbr>global-religious-landscape-unaffili<wbr>ated\/<br>http:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/news\/wor<wbr>ldnews\/asia\/china\/10776023\/China-on<wbr>-course-to-become-worlds-most-Chris<wbr>tian-nation-within-15-years.html<br>http:\/\/masterrussian.com\/russia\/fac<wbr>ts.htm","filename":"1443381006308","ext":".png","w":800,"h":800,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490194961833,"time":1490194961,"md5":"AScdqMi6ecWacc\/l81+Mwg==","fsize":502696,"resto":0,"id":"CuFrAocL","country":"PL","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"atheism-is-the-fastest-shrinking-religion-in-the","country_name":"Poland","replies":3,"images":2,"unique_ips":3},{"no":117769575,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)11:08:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"That&#039;s only because religion goes hand in hand with niggerness (pic related), and niggers don&#039;t use contraception.","filename":"nones-2007","ext":".png","w":717,"h":274,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":47,"tim":1490195312724,"time":1490195312,"md5":"PU+U3zL4\/D8qrid6hmcwGA==","fsize":11251,"resto":117768653,"id":"vhp4xKxL","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":117769834,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)11:10:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117768653\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117768653<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;believing in sky fairies in the 21th century<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;defending some jewish messianism cult<\/span><br><br>topkek","time":1490195425,"resto":117768653,"id":"HxKB0g9D","country":"HU","country_name":"Hungary"},{"no":117771607,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)11:20:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117769834\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117769834<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;being a faggot<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;ever<\/span>","filename":"1490190943626","ext":".jpg","w":922,"h":525,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":71,"tim":1490196036001,"time":1490196036,"md5":"yAYh1gyVdEm\/A2VyR2P2Jg==","fsize":224359,"resto":117768653,"id":"CuFrAocL","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"}]}

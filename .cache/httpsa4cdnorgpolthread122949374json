I&#039;ve sent you various premature bullshit apologies before, but unlike everything that was sent prior to this email, this apology is without any motive or selfish hopes, for the first time:<br><br>Simply put, last week I met someone at the airport. Our silly &amp; fun memories popped up, which were then stomped out by memories of my post-breakup actions....Which is what&#039;s been happening since November; fucking soul crushing considering almost all our memories were precious, really.<br><br>Rather than go over everything that I fucked up on from Aug-Nov, I&#039;ll say that from recently experiencing a similar post-break up clinging in reversed shoes with a woman...Her little bit of clinging I experienced was off putting enough...I don&#039;t think I have enough manhood hair to handle everything that was thrown your way from me, I really don&#039;t think I do lol.<br><br>We all walk through a desert to get to our oasis. After the split, rather than focusing on how to get to my own oasis, I repeatedly offered you some water without having any real water to offer: a mirage in that desert that stunted us both.<br><br>what I&#039;m trying to say is, I&#039;d love to meet up at say, Skyline Tavern to offer you some water (&quot;water&quot;) to resolve the bullshit I caused.<br><br>To wrap it up, the idea of us not being friends considering the experiences we had together is just disgusting. On the level of &quot;Oh-that&#039;s-SICK&quot; updating from Windows 8 kind of disgusting. GROSS.<br><br>Like two friends getting back together after a regrettable misunderstanding fallout, I&#039;d love to meet up to update each other. SO much to update, like holy shit. If you wanna, anyway.<br><br>I really did enjoy helping you write a page in your life story, but I&#039;d moreso enoy helping edit &amp; rewrite how that page ended, please.","filename":"download","ext":".png","w":225,"h":225,"tn_w":225,"tn_h":225,"tim":1493245442214,"time":1493245442,"md5":"6fjKFvbJtl9iocO7r\/UEDQ==","fsize":3612,"resto":0,"id":"RvYatWQm","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"hallo","country_name":"United States","replies":27,"images":4,"unique_ips":14},{"no":122949490,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)18:24:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122949374\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122949374<\/a><br>Oh yeah forgot to mention <br><br>Need red pilled advice on this apology letter I wrote for my ex girlfriend","time":1493245492,"resto":122949374,"id":"RvYatWQm","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122949612,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)18:25:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122949490\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122949490<\/a><br>Why would you wanna be friends with your ex ?Just let that shit die also not your personal blog faggot","time":1493245550,"resto":122949374,"id":"ZbNIUHd9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122950338,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)18:31:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122949612\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122949612<\/a><br>This, just move on.......With a robot :^)<br>But seriously it won&#039;t result in anything good.","filename":"IMG_0342","ext":".jpg","w":450,"h":338,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1493245875848,"time":1493245875,"md5":"INsOaxiYCxBd535LpCoePg==","fsize":20241,"resto":122949374,"id":"O6v9BNVc","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122950570,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)18:32:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"Bad move Anon.","time":1493245979,"resto":122949374,"id":"JNoeFob7","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122950651,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)18:33:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122949612\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122949612<\/a><br>Well in part it&#039;s in hopes of getting back with her.<br><br>Also to end a bad breakup into a positive note, you know","time":1493246019,"resto":122949374,"id":"Aq\/\/BCeN","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122950727,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)18:34:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122950651\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122950651<\/a><br>Desperate as fuck","time":1493246053,"resto":122949374,"id":"JNoeFob7","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122950809,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)18:34:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122950651\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122950651<\/a><br>She&#039;s taken many dicks since, just move on.","time":1493246086,"resto":122949374,"id":"O6v9BNVc","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122950815,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)18:34:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122950570\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122950570<\/a><br>Hmmmm wait how ?<br><br>We were fantastic together, though the breakup ended pretty bad<br><br>It&#039;s me wanting to fix that","time":1493246091,"resto":122949374,"id":"Aq\/\/BCeN","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122950962,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)18:35:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122950809\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122950809<\/a><br>She probably hasn&#039;t, and I&#039;ve done more obscene things than her I guarantee you","time":1493246157,"resto":122949374,"id":"Aq\/\/BCeN","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122951134,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)18:37:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122950815\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122950815<\/a><br>You will come across as desperate and her wizard sleeve will become drier than the Sahara desert.

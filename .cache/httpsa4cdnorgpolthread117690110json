Cars are complete degeneracy. You can go to this same location today and it will look the same. The difference? No cars. They take up too much space. Cars lead to abominations like strip malls and huge ugly parking lots. Cars need space to park. You can go to any downtown in America and you will find a big ugly row of metal cars on the side. Cities are lined with vertical garages that look hideous.<br><br>The self driving cars can&#039;t come soon enough. I can&#039;t wait for the day a self driving uber replaces the degeneracy of carnownership.","filename":"IMG_1371","ext":".jpg","w":1600,"h":900,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1490140609193,"time":1490140609,"md5":"g\/WbW4aoiBwXhU1lGsEVkw==","fsize":482744,"resto":0,"id":"KrCXqUq1","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"you-see-this-picture-do-you-want-to-know-the-real","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

I was wondering if the chance of Le Pen winning was always a possibility, or if it&#039;s only now that people are starting to consider her a contender? I was never a Trump supporter but boy did I laugh my ass off when he won. The smugness of everyone saying there was no chance in hell was over barring. She&#039;s much more of a serious politician then him but was she not seen as a possible contender early on?","filename":"Le pen","ext":".jpg","w":220,"h":306,"tn_w":179,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493343080302,"time":1493343080,"md5":"AvCaQ+BYMD9TD+d2ZP3fKw==","fsize":12793,"resto":0,"id":"Hr9gnata","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"i-havent-been-following-the-french-elections","country_name":"United States","replies":12,"images":0,"unique_ips":8},{"no":123124356,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)21:32:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"yeah I wanna know how it&#039;s going too, someone give us a quick rundown","time":1493343143,"resto":123124242,"id":"66k6QnSs","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123124592,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)21:34:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"Well after Le Pen and Macron went on to the runoff election, Le Pen dropped out of her National Front party. She is still running but doesn&#039;t want the stigma of her nationalist party.

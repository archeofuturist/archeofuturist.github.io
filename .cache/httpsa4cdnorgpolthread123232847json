It splits the child&#039;s group loyalties, and isolates him. No one he grows up around looks like him, not even his parents. Familiarity is an important aspect of being comfortable.<br><br>2. It is often humiliating and one-sided. Your image shows perfectly how it usually works. Asian women go for white men and white women go for black men. Very few white men go for black women and the same is for white women and Asian men. This produces resentment among the black women, the Asian men, and the white men who are aware of it and have a healthy sense of racial preference for their own group. It probably exists to a small extent with white women as well, although there aren&#039;t really enough Asians in most of the country for it to be pronounced, and white women still know they&#039;re valued, especially by black men, for whom they are the holy grail. Black women want to feel valued by their men and asian men by their women. Asian women date outside of their race over 40% of the time and you need only go to Ling Anderson&#039;s youtube channel or \/r\/asianmssculinity to see what kind of psychological havoc is wrought by this. Ling turned gay because it was the only alternative he saw to killing himself over the shame of all of his female family members (in his estimation) favoring white men over people like him.<br>3. It rapidly changes the course of thousands of years of evolution in specific environments, resulting in a physiology that is potentially not particularly well adapted for anywhere. Europeans evolved blue eyes and white skin so they could avoid becoming snowblind when hunting, and absorb more vitamin D through the sun. Black people have dark brown skin because there&#039;s so much sunlight where they&#039;re from, a white person would get skin cancer if they lived like Africans did. On the flipside, Africans are at a high risk of getting rickets if they don&#039;t take vitamin D in low-sunlight areas. There is a chance(so I&#039;ve heard) that a mixed race kid can get shafted on immunities as well.","time":1493408663,"resto":123232847,"id":"73xx+BAu","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123235744,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)15:46:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"BLEACHED","time":1493408773,"resto":123232847,"id":"dcbjGMQS","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123237122,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)15:58:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123235744\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123235744<\/a><br>BREACHED***","time":1493409513,"resto":123232847,"id":"ZAHo70CJ","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123237255,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)15:59:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123235537\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123235537<\/a><br>4. Temperamental differences and general differences in competence evolved along with the bodies of peoples that came to be in radically different environments. The Indo-European peoples who are the progenitors of the white and Indian races were able to conquer largely because they were the first to invent the chariot. They had the mental assets to be able to devise it, produce it in large numbers, and use it to propagate themselves over others. This is one aspect of a racial mental nature. The branch that moved north into Europe had to deal with winter. Winter destroyed the genes of those who were too dumb to survive it. We take surviving the winter for granted now, but imagine trying to survive one without using anything anyone else has built and you&#039;ll quickly understand how terrifying winter actually is. They had to build shelters and learn to preserve food. The blacks did not even have any domestic animals before European contact. They are overall a dumber race, because they are a more comfortable race. There is sone evidence that blacks may have more capacity for strength and athleticism because they have on average a higher muscle to fat ratio than whites and dominate in sone sports. If we assume this is true for the sake of argument, a half black abd half white child, while having at least some chance of getting the best of both races, there&#039;s a greater chance he will be in the middle in both respects. Inferior in strength to the black parent and inferior in intelligence to the white. And that&#039;s even assuming it&#039;s not a dumb white and a weak black.","time":1493409578,"resto":123232847,"id":"73xx+BAu","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123237279,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)15:59:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123232847\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123232847<\/a><br>So many important things to worry about in this world yet people spend time caring about who other people marry.","time":1493409588,"resto":123232847,"id":"RuxCA0nU","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123237332,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)16:00:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123232847\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123232847<\/a><br>This is why we need a new board.

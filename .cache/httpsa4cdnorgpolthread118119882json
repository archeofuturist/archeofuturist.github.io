They didn&#039;t want to preserve Yugoslavia, but they finally openly displayed their nationalistic aspirations to annex territories of Croatia back then populated by the Serbs and create greater Serbia to enter post-Yugoslav world as. This is beyond dispute.<br><br>What is however strange is how they worked on this pathetic plan since Tito died. This is due to two reasons:<br><br>1) In Yugoslavia which was supposed to be &quot;internationalist&quot;, Croats were considered filthy fascists and were eliminated from the top of the Party once Tito died. Anti-Croat propaganda was heavy.<br><br>2) At the same time, Serbian everlasting thirst for territories of other nations grew, as did the Yugoslav weapon arsenal mainly stored in Serbia.<br><br>Once we declared independence as was our constitutional right, Serbia seized the opportunity under crazy leadership to use their (then - our) weapons and half-assedly invade Croatia, which is kind of bizarre that they&#039;d attempt something like that. Of course, their soldiers were merely Yugoslavian people believing in brotherhood of all nations or just didn&#039;t give a single fuck, very few of them were actual Serb nationalists that would for some reason care to annex Krajina. That&#039;s why the war fucking failed, they barely even fought and Croats were ready to give every single life to preserve our ancient homeland, after finally establishing truly sovereign modern nation after several bad and infamous attempts.","time":1490385757,"resto":118119882,"id":"HXFnpo89","country":"HR","country_name":"Croatia"},{"no":118122473,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)16:03:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118121908\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118121908<\/a><br><br>Oh nice, is Romanian language hard to learn?

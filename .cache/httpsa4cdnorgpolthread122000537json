I also see pic related type of thing said all the time.<br>However, I&#039;ve never actually seen any statistics or seen a good reason for why this would be the case. Do these people just think white christian red necks wait for a tranny to show up in public so they can kill them? I have literally never heard of a single story of this happening, but this (((statistic))) is quoted everywhere.<br><br>So, are there are any stats that actually prove that trannies are disproportionately targeted for murder\/hate crimes compared to normal people or is this more bullshit?","filename":"vqpAj[1]","ext":".jpg","w":951,"h":357,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":93,"tim":1492699142629,"time":1492699142,"md5":"rtTj4TYdO9mMPB90Tb7HeQ==","fsize":105948,"resto":0,"id":"SJIVQ\/vn","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"pol-i-recently-had-an-sjw-presentation-at-my","country_name":"United States","replies":9,"images":0,"unique_ips":8},{"no":122001329,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)10:47:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122000537\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122000537<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;at a rate 4 times the normal population<\/span><br><br>They kill themselves","time":1492699661,"resto":122000537,"id":"tVKUVYE9","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122001515,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)10:49:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122001329\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122001329<\/a><br>But with a rate of 10 times more than the normal population.","time":1492699792,"resto":122000537,"id":"ySqMv9DF","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":122001574,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)10:50:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122001329\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122001329<\/a><br>I was under the assumption that they killed themselves too because they are Frankenstein abominations, but the presentation and the OP specifically mention &quot;violence&quot;","time":1492699826,"resto":122000537,"id":"SJIVQ\/vn","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122001673,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)10:51:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"if a tranny wants to get into a hookup and wait until the other person sees their dick before they say anything they should be killed.","time":1492699887,"resto":122000537,"id":"9+NtfzmE","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122002153,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)10:56:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122000537\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122000537<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;sociologists<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;using real statistics in a correct way<\/span><br>1.

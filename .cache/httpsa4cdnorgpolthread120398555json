The process is identical in anarcho-capitalism except courts and enforcers are private and polycentric. <br><br>(II): In Techno-Commercialism, a sovereign company governs a micro-state and prevents private courts and enforcers from engaging in Hobbesian warfare whilst providing a sovereign court of final appeal.","time":1491802926,"resto":120398555,"id":"+QwwtFXp","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120400111,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)01:44:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120398951\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120398951<\/a><br><br>I didn&#039;t draw it.","time":1491803074,"resto":120398555,"id":"+QwwtFXp","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

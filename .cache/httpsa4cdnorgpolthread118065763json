Our governments are responsible for creating the political climate in the Middle East that gave rise to islamic extremism and caused migration.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;2. Our governments are directly using agents to create the illusion of muslim terrorists, so that we will elect certain people to power and help pass laws to give them more power (surveillance)<\/span><br><br>Now, especially \/pol\/ is NUTS about elections. We love elections don&#039;t we, elections are to us what World Cup finals are to \/sp\/, or scooby&#039;s riddles were to \/fit\/, etc. etc. Usually we want people elected like Le Pen, Wilders, Trump, because most of us believe that they will bring out the change in policy that will keep us safe from the muslim extremist threat.<br><br>But, consider this. Where do muslim extremists come from and what is the history of those countries?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Egypt<\/span><br>Used to be hyper-secular. The idea of veils being mandatory was a joke to them, and the suggestion of it was actually COMEDY on their TV. But, hey, Nasser was an enemy of Israel and had to go.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Afghanistan<\/span><br>In order to fight off communism, the Taliban were armed and trained, and propaganda was spread to enforce the idea of freedom fighter terrorists (pic related)<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Syria<\/span><br>Assad was a member of the most secular of muslim orders. Homosexuality was illegal by law but tolerated, with underground gay clubs in cities like Damascus and Aleppo being protected by the secret police. In Damascus, girls could walk around with tank tops revealing their bellies. But, Assad was opposed to America and ISIS could funnel away oil, so...<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Indonesia<\/span><br>Used to be under Dutch control after WWII. The Dutch colonial government was extremely strict against Islam, and lax against local tribal and pagan cultures. The USA pressured the Dutch to retreat and even threatened to attack our government in Indonesia. Now, Indonesia harbours the largest muslim population in the world.<br><br>1\/2","filename":"afgh-text-3","ext":".jpg","w":380,"h":572,"tn_w":166,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490349746411,"time":1490349746,"md5":"asrpIY1ZGdUaQN3MCmrKaQ==","fsize":35285,"resto":0,"id":"yvupemMb","country":"NL","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"hey-pol-let-me-present-you-with-a-conundrum-about","country_name":"Netherlands","replies":3,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":118065781,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)06:02:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"2\/2<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Iran<\/span><br>Everybody knows this story. They had a shah, they were very modern, very Western, but the USA needed a puppet government so they overthrew the shah and installed a religious dictatorship they thought they could control. Now, Iran is the sworn enemy of the OTHER most muslim extremist country in the world, Saudi-Arabia, and tensions between the two fuel extremism in the region which is then exported to the West.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Serbia<\/span><br>Supposedly, Serbia was invaded by NATO to prevent them from purging the muslim population. Right, how many people are being slaughtered or displaced from their homes around the world, muslim or not? How many of those countries are invaded by UN or NATO forces? Why Serbia? Think about it.<br><br>Now, either way, our Western governments (or, the USA and other Western governments by proxy) are responsible for the situation of extremism we experience today. Nearly every source of terrorism is directly or indirectly influenced by Western policies in the Middle East since WWI, and especially since WWII and the rise of the oil industry.<br><br>So, take that into account, and the ADDITIONAL POSSIBILITY, but not certainty, that our governments want to create a surveillance state. Look how convenient it is for them, that these attacks start to occur right around the time we&#039;re developing a global digital network that connects everything and everyone on the planet. How. Convenient.<br><br>Whichever way you look at it, governments are resposible for this situation, and they are NOT going to get us out of it. Why place your trust in them? Why get excited about elections when in the end, it&#039;s the GOVERNMENTS and those behind the scenes that are responsible for our cultures eroding and our loved ones dying. It&#039;s governments you should fight against, not political groups.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;GOVERNMENTS<\/span>","time":1490349766,"resto":118065763,"id":"yvupemMb","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":118067556,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)06:30:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"bump","time":1490351430,"resto":118065763,"id":"yvupemMb","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":118068317,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)06:41:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118065763\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118065763<\/a><br><a href=\"#p118065781\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118065781<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Zeitgeist 16yr old logic<\/span><br><br>Not bad to start with.<br>--<br><br>You have to look at debt-problems, demographic-economy, electoral advantages, ...","time":1490352104,"resto":118065763,"id":"T1hRsyxy","country":"BE","country_name":"Belgium"}]}

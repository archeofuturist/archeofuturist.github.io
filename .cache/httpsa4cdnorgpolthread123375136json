Not buy the item<\/span><br><br>or<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;B. Buy the item <\/span><br><br>Say you decide not to buy the item. But this guy manages to get someone else to buy it. This guy takes this item, and makes a &quot;copy&quot; of it. He notices you didn&#039;t buy it, and that you weren&#039;t going to buy it in the first place, and gives you his &quot;copy&quot; of it for free. <br><br>Now, having the experience you&#039;ve gaind from this &quot;copy,&quot; your judgement can either be: <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;A. You take it upon yourself to purchase this item because you find it necessary to compensate its worth<\/span><br><br>or<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;B. You still remain decided in not purchasing it as you were before, because you don&#039;t think its worth it <\/span><br><br>Now, what about the guy selling this item? Since you weren&#039;t going to buy it, he wasn&#039;t going to make a sale. Therefore, he didn&#039;t lose any money, but he didn&#039;t gain any money either. The man who purchased it and made &quot;copies&quot; gave him money, so he made a sale. <br><br>But since he gave a copy to you, and you can choose to judge whether or not its worth compensating for the product, then the seller has made another sale that he might not have made in the first place. But if you choose not to buy it, then he still hasn&#039;t lost money, since you weren&#039;t going to buy it. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;tl;dr: if someone doesnt buy it, then there wasnt a lost sale. if someone pirates and buys it, its a sale that wasnt going to be made, so its beneficial to the seller.<\/span>","filename":"1493263686930","ext":".jpg","w":720,"h":720,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493500558254,"time":1493500558,"md5":"jdwlG4DiLmTrBwoH6lwO2w==","fsize":119795,"resto":123375136,"id":"OhsOfcGL","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123382798,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)17:18:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"can&#039;t remember the last time i paid for any media or software<br><br>last movie i saw in theaters was Mad Max. actually almost forgot, i saw the first new star wars, but it was absolute shit.

Initially a euphemism for anal sex amongst secretly homosexual husbands in the town, upon questioning by those outside of the homosexual circles by what they meant by &quot;deep dish pizza&quot; the food we know to today was created as a cover. Though it is not absolutely clear who pioneered this method of pizza creation, most historians agree that a particularly hairy bear named Gino played a large part. Having relatively little knowledge of pizza beyond the fact that they are referred to as &quot;pies,&quot; a point of confusion that would lead to the structure of deep dish pizza, he set out to create what would be known as Chicago Deep Dish pizza using little more than five pounds of dough, a gallon of tomato sauce, 4 ounces of cheese and a potato. As time went on it slowly became slightly more recognizable as a pizza, including the ceasing of shaping the dough in a cooking pot, and the addition of more cheese and more known pizza toppings. As a whole Chicago-style deep dish pizza is still popular within the homosexual community (food and term for anal sex) and it continues to be a beacon of degeneracy","time":1491389192,"resto":119593434,"id":"ti3L0llA","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":119594335,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)06:50:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119594045\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119594045<\/a><br>Do you live in Kalgoorlie, STRAYA?","time":1491389442,"resto":119593434,"id":"4uxDAKof","country":"IT","country_name":"Italy"},{"no":119594468,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)06:52:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119593434\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119593434<\/a><br>Pepperoni Pizza Macarone Luigi","time":1491389560,"resto":119593434,"id":"KOcz3fgU","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":119594543,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)06:53:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119593537\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119593537<\/a><br><a href=\"#p119594468\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119594468<\/a><br><br>Zitto animale","time":1491389621,"resto":119593434,"id":"FKbmcgFF","country":"CH","country_name":"Switzerland"},{"no":119594576,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)06:54:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"Can somebody give me the scoop on Abruzzo.

I guess its true what they say, once the government takes an inch they&#039;ll soon take a mile and they will never step an inch back, EVER.<br><br>Whens the last fucking time you heard of an entire law being repealed because it was the right thing to do? No. The only time a law in this country is altered or removed in any way is when the SCOC tells the government all or parts of a certain law is Unconstitutional. If that does not happen, those in the seats of power do not give one flying fuck about doing the right thing.<br><br>Any excuse is valid to increase taxation and government revenues. Any excuse is valid for departments and programs to increase in size and demand more funding for its own sake only.","filename":"324924208","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":372,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":155,"tim":1493530044648,"time":1493530044,"md5":"gO1akJetUz3izBbNzBeACg==","fsize":82349,"resto":0,"id":"lpGkQyaf","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"hey-fellow-leafer-how-about-we-start-a-campaign","country_name":"Canada","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

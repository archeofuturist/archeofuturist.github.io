Earlier today, at 12:25 Eastern March 23, 2017, the US Senate voted on S.J.Res 34, and will use the Congressional Review Act to strip away broadband privacy protections that kept Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and telecoms from selling your internet history and app data usage to third parties. S.J.Res 34 was first introduced by 23 Republican Senators earlier this month and its blitz approval is a giant blow to privacy rights in the United States.&quot; - Caleb Chen, Privacy News Online<\/span><br><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;This idea spawned from a witty Reddit comment.

In the final roll call 15 Republicans flipped to oppose. This only tells us that our efforts calling our representatives is working.

I encourage everyone to stay active on this issue; call your representatives who voted No and thank them, let them know we are watching and listening. Just as important, all your representative who voted in favor of this horrible bill. We need to let politicians know we are paying close attention to their actions on the hill and will respond appropriately during the upcoming election cycle.

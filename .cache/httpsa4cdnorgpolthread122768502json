I liked COD for the zombies up through black ops 2 but couldn&#039;t really dig the multiplayer, everyone was always hostile, the guns always handled and sounded terrible, and doing good in multiplayer was always luck based no matter what the devs did. It&#039;s not even an esports thing anymore, literally the hype and playerbase died after the shit dlc setup that was mw3. Its only good for a local shooter to split screen with friends and even then theres a ton of alternative local games a hell of a lot cheaper.

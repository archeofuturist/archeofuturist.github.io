recovery[edit]<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In the spring of 2002, a civilian Mi-26 was leased to recover two U.S. Army MH-47E Chinook helicopters from a mountain in Afghanistan. The Chinooks, operated by the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment, had been employed in Operation Anaconda, an effort to drive al Qaeda and Taliban fighters out of the Shahi-Kot Valley and surrounding mountains. They found themselves stranded on the slopes above Sirkhankel at altitudes of 2,600 metres (8,500 ft) and 3,100 metres (10,200 ft). While the second craft was too badly damaged to recover, the first was determined to be repairable and estimated to weigh 12,000 kilograms (26,000 lb) with fuel, rotors, and non-essential equipment removed. That weight exceeded the maximum payload of 9,100 kilograms (20,100 lb) at an altitude of 2,600 metres (8,500 ft) of the U.S. military&#039;s Sikorsky CH-53E.[4]<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The Mi-26 was located through Skylink Aviation in Toronto, which had connections with a Russian company called Sportsflite that operated three civilian Mi-26 versions called &quot;Heavycopters&quot;. One of the aircraft, aiding in construction and firefighting work in neighboring Tajikistan, was leased for $300,000; it lifted the Chinook flew it to Kabul, then later to Bagram Air Base, Afghanistan to ship to Fort Campbell, Kentucky, U.S. for repairs. Six months later, a second U.S. Army CH-47 that had made a hard landing 100 miles (160 km) north of Bagram at an altitude of 1,200 metres (3,900 ft) was recovered by another Sportsflite-operated Mi-26 Heavycopter.[4]<\/span><br><br>Embarrassing DESU","time":1492633519,"resto":121883130,"id":"xIGY3Rtx","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121890857,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)16:25:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121888536\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121888536<\/a><br>The stallion was built in the early 80s britbong, your was built in 99.","time":1492633519,"resto":121883130,"id":"J8YKoXgk","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121890861,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)16:25:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121890590\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121890590<\/a><br>america is paved with money, i don&#039;t give a shit about the price tag as long as we have an insurmountable advantage in destroying continents","time":1492633523,"resto":121883130,"id":"JScAut8S","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121891018,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)16:26:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121883130\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121883130<\/a><br>That&#039;s a sexy chopper","time":1492633594,"resto":121883130,"id":"\/HfvRRA5","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121891040,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)16:26:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121883413\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121883413<\/a><br>What does Trump have to do with this?","filename":"image","ext":".png","w":601,"h":600,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":124,"tim":1492633604034,"time":1492633604,"md5":"Y8eTlWeHmlGWIMRtxDpDNw==","fsize":189931,"resto":121883130,"id":"QFB4nfkl","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121891057,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)16:26:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121890861\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121890861<\/a><br>this, id rather my tax dollars go to keeping our military on the cutting edge then socialist programs and gibs","time":1492633611,"resto":121883130,"id":"J8YKoXgk","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121891067,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)16:26:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121883130\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121883130<\/a><br>On the other hand, we won&#039;t need to replace our vintage Sea Kings from the 60&#039;s with these.

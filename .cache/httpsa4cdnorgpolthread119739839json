He said the new bill would not restrict the freedom of expression, but intervene only when criminal hatred or intentionally false news are posted.&quot;<br><br>Of course, all of this begs the question of exactly how German officials define &quot;fake news&quot; as the lines between what is pure &#039;fact&#039; versus &#039;opinion&#039; often grow very blurred in politics. Moreover, politicians themselves are often the biggest purveyors of &quot;fake news&quot;...so if someone quotes the erroneous comments of a German politician on FaceBook is the social network then liable? All questions that would have seemed silly just a year ago...","filename":"article-2328536-19EBA813000005DC-532_1024x615_large","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":384,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":150,"tim":1491483441697,"time":1491483441,"md5":"MpEv\/ARIdCn1VOMc\/zY3bQ==","fsize":67530,"resto":0,"id":"cARfYLbZ","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"german-chancellor-angela-merkel-has-apparently","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":119741192,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)09:14:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"blablablabalabla conspiracy theory blabla germans are cucks blablaba we are all lost blabla didnt read this shit.

President Trump created a new, co-equal position specifically for Bannon to occupy: Chief Strategist.<br><br>In a similar arrangement during the campaign, below Trump himself there were always two chief administrators of the Trump campaign: a campaign manager and a chief executive. <br><br>Trump went through three campaign managers during the presidential campaign, two being fired upon their first major blunders and replaced with a subordinate. In order from first to last, including the primaries, they were Lewandowski, Manafort, and Conway. All the while, however, the same chief executive stayed on from start to finish: Bannon.<br><br>Bannon is an ideologue. Bannon is deeply political. Bannon isn&#039;t doing this because someone is paying him, or because he has some personal motivation to be close to the president. He has clear goals concerning America and this planet.<br><br>Some quotes from him:<br><br>&quot;I\u2019m a Leninist. Lenin wanted to destroy the state, and that\u2019s my goal too. I want to bring everything crashing down, and destroy all of today\u2019s establishment.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Darkness is good. Dick Cheney. Darth Vader. Satan. That&#039;s power. It only helps us when they [the Left] get it wrong. When they&#039;re blind to who we are and what we&#039;re doing.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I am Thomas Cromwell in the court of the Tudors.&quot;","filename":"soon","ext":".png","w":600,"h":804,"tn_w":186,"tn_h":249,"tim":1490459155470,"time":1490459155,"md5":"tXvOMSW2gvWTolotBnXEXQ==","fsize":196406,"resto":0,"id":"1YRldH9F","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"lets-talk-about-steve-bannon","country_name":"United States","replies":5,"images":3,"unique_ips":5},{"no":118241301,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)12:30:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118240834\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118240834<\/a><br>Bannon and sessions are legitimate white nationalists","filename":"sessions","ext":".jpg","w":222,"h":247,"tn_w":112,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490459438011,"time":1490459438,"md5":"RChdAAJnM5Kus0imMVAFbQ==","fsize":20104,"resto":118240834,"id":"7e+ifzTC","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118241886,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)12:36:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118241301\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118241301<\/a><br>Kill yourself","filename":"57C8A9BD-E476-4983-BFCB-AE5F2654E6A8-221-00000009ED6B0EE0_tmp","ext":".jpg","w":795,"h":580,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":91,"tim":1490459787465,"time":1490459787,"md5":"wPuITPb0Z+iCOXsT\/Qba9Q==","fsize":106816,"resto":118240834,"id":"N6BDvmK8","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118242875,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)12:45:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118241301\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118241301<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Get the death penalty for 2 klansmen who lynched a black man.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Bankrupt the clan in Alabama with follow up civil suit.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Represent 3 disenfranchised black candidates who were victims of voter fraud, but gets called a racist because the people committing the fraud were &quot;civil rights activists&quot;.<\/span><br><br>Mmmmm, nope.","time":1490460317,"resto":118240834,"id":"FKMcDFpm","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118243682,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)12:52:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"None of that shit matters.

The domination by a single power of either of Eurasia&#039;s two principal spheres\u2014Europe and Asia\u2014remains a good definition of strategic danger for America. Cold War or no Cold War. For such a grouping would have the capacity to outstrip America economically and, in the end, militarily.

But in the meantime it is imperative that no Eurasian challenger emerges, capable of dominating Eurasia and thus also of challenging America\u2026 For America the chief geopolitical prize is Eurasia\u2026and America&#039;s global primacy is directly dependent on how long and how effectively its preponderance on the Eurasian continent is sustained<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;if the intentions ever changed, America would find itself with a grossly diminished capacity for effective resistance and a growing inability to shape events<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; It follows that\u2026 American foreign policy must\u2026employ its influence in Eurasia in a manner that creates a stable continental equilibrium, with the United States as the political arbiter<\/span>","time":1491454123,"resto":119701662,"id":"oGfu75D7","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119706817,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)00:52:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119706493\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119706493<\/a><br>Neocons gotta Neocon.

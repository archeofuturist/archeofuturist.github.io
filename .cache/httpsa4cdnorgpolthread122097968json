I asked local Turks what they thought about this, and what they were planning on doing with them. The first person I asked, I asked something like &quot;So, how does your government plan to integrate them? Where will they be housed?&quot; He said, &quot;Oh no, we are sending them home, when the conflict is over. They will not be staying here, no one wants that.&quot; Everyone else I spoke with said the same thing.<br><br>Why can&#039;t the West do the same? Honestly, I wouldn&#039;t be opposed to taking in thousands of refugees, if they went home in a few years. I do genuinely want to help people in need - but not at the expense of my nation and my culture. Why do western nations not do this? Why do we, by default, keep our refugees here permanently?<br><br>Would you be fort taking in refugess if they were sent home when the conflict was over?","filename":"syrian-refugee-camp-in-turkey","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":360,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1492750318619,"time":1492750318,"md5":"tseheP4eWcJiKoY\/C1QVlA==","fsize":81970,"resto":0,"id":"fpEWp1yj","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"would-you-be-opposed-to-taking-in-refugees-if","country_name":"United States","replies":7,"images":0,"unique_ips":5},{"no":122098957,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)01:02:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"OP, do you personally give strangers money based on a verbal promise that they will pay it back at some unspecified future time?","time":1492750931,"resto":122097968,"id":"j8+AbLEy","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122099833,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)01:11:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122097968\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122097968<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;refugees<\/span><br>They should never, ever come to the US.

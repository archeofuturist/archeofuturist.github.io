Nor does he blame those elements in French society that harbor fears of Islam.<br><br><br>Sigal Samuel:What do you make of the results of the first round of voting?<br><br>Tareq Oubrou:These results were expected; they weren\u2019t a big surprise. But the rise of the National Front is an indicator that French society is in crisis, an economic and identity crisis. The same questions that animate America\u2014globalization, unemployment, terrorism\u2014these questions play an important role in our elections today. French society is scared of Islam, is scared of terrorism, and the advance of the National Front is a sign of that fear.<br><br>Samuel:How do you feel about a potential Le Pen victory and its impact on Muslims?<br><br>Oubrou:It doesn\u2019t worry me. The National Front\u2019s main issue is with immigration, not French Muslims. And Le Pen can\u2019t change the law. French society will react. It doesn\u2019t accept racism. Just because Le Pen is in government, doesn\u2019t mean society will go along with anything.<br><br>But I don\u2019t think the National Front will govern. \u2026 It\u2019s not easy to govern when you don\u2019t have the experience and you don\u2019t have a clear plan. How do you leave Europe? How do you isolate yourself from the world? How can you definitively seal the borders? Politicians promise a lot of things, but once they gain power they realize that the reality is very complex. We saw this with Trump: He promised to withdraw from the world, but reality is catching up to him\u2014he has to engage with the world, otherwise there\u2019s chaos.","filename":"Screenshot_2017-04-30-16-10-50_1","ext":".jpg","w":1078,"h":1229,"tn_w":219,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493544090266,"time":1493544090,"md5":"OqlDfJrqUQjEQRSNMk8Gbg==","fsize":197511,"resto":0,"id":"9C8tKzeu","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"a-top-imam-says-he-understands-why-some-voters","country_name":"United States","replies":8,"images":1,"unique_ips":7},{"no":123460369,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)05:23:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"Samuel:How would a Macron victory impact Muslims?<br><br>Oubrou:Macron didn\u2019t play off identity issues.

For them, any Muslim practice is a form of Islamism. This prejudice gets reflected by many politicians, on the right as on the left.<br><br>Samuel:Several candidates in this election suggested that the assimilation of Muslims in France is a major problem. How do you respond to that?<br><br>Oubrou:I understand it. A French person who is scared of Islam\u2014I understand it. If I were a Frenchman who didn\u2019t know Islam, I\u2019d also be scared, because every time they talk about Islam it\u2019s in terms of terrorism. There are legitimate fears. It\u2019s legitimate to be scared when you hear about people who kill in the name of God and in the name of Islam. You\u2019re going to ask yourself: The Muslim next to me, isn\u2019t he at risk of becoming a fundamentalist and a terrorist? So the idea circulates that every Muslim, even if he\u2019s nice, risks becoming a fundamentalist or terrorist. Prejudices circulate and fear is the response.

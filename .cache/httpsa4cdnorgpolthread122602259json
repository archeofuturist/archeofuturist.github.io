According to the Chinese press, Xi emphasized China\u2019s determination to achieve denuclearization and stability on the Korean Peninsula through negotiations. The North Korean nuclear issue can be resolved only when relevant parties take up their responsibility, Xi reportedly said. The negotiations between the United States and China over North Korea will almost certainly entail compromise on both sides. Meanwhile, Abe described his call with Trump as an in-depth exchange of views and said the two reaffirmed their commitment to resolving the situation.

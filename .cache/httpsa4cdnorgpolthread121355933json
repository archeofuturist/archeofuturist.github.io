Their tactics boil down to &quot;achieve local superiority in numbers, swarm isolated targets,&quot; and nothing else. They are, essentially, a mob, and their greatest weakness is a total lack of morale and combat ability. They are weak people who are terrified of their enemies.<br><br>Solution the First: Skirmishing Tactics<br>Thrown weapons are deeply underestimated as weapons in riots. During the Venetian Bridge Wars, tradesmen would walk around town with iron balls in their aprons, to be thrown at rivals in the event of an ambush. In our case, imagine each man simply carried metal weights--like fishing sinkers, say--to throw at the enemy in the event of an attack. This would be rapid, decisive, and terrifying. Cringing Leftists hate and fear missiles, especially missiles that might actually hurt. Coupled with rudimentary training in fisticuffs to defeat this who avoid the barrage, this sounds like a decisive tactic. Its weakness is that it might work TOO well, and result in police intervention when dozens of faggot antifas end up seriously injured.<br><br>Solution the Second: The Manipular System.<br>The Romans adapted their tactics to fight against the Samnites in the hills of Italy. Contrary to popular belief, the Romans were not still, orderly formation fighters by choice, they preferred to operate in small groups and to create swirling melees which disadvantaged the spearmen they often fought in Magna Graeca. The short sword and the large scutum shield were ideal for this style of fighting. We can emulate these tactics through the use of riot-shield style weapons and truncheons or clubs. Small groups of men trained to watch each others&#039; backs will defeat any number of untrained Antifas in this regard. The downsides of this strategy are, again, that it may be too effective and that it necessitates a weapon.","time":1492359583,"resto":121355933,"id":"jH7\/2D4N","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121375998,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)12:20:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121375570\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121375570<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;It should be made extremely clear it is a defensive unit and training to protect ourselves from attacks.<\/span><br>this is the correct way to go about this; well said.","time":1492359630,"resto":121355933,"id":"n6Xx2SBg","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121376108,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)12:21:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121375570\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121375570<\/a><br>Excellent article here:<br><br>https:\/\/brushbeater.wordpress.com\/2<wbr>015\/09\/14\/communications-basics-for<wbr>-small-units\/<br><br>&quot;When planning communications for a Patrol, we use the PACE acronym, standing for Primary, Alternate, Contingency, Emergency.&quot;<br><br>When organizing for events, we should have alternative means for communication outside of pol and the chans.","time":1492359676,"resto":121355933,"id":"MvoTsKil","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121376195,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)12:21:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121375570\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121375570<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;A sort of &#039;hand book&#039; could be devised<\/span><br>You mean like these? --<a href=\"#p121370906\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121370906<\/a><br>Both of these books are extremely detailed in the forming, organizing and training for the type of activity you are proposing.

I thought it would be a horrible site from before ever going on it, but it seems cool now! Twitter and Instagram are cancers to society in my opinion, and sites like this and reddit give me a sense of community I have not felt before. I&#039;m extremely new to 4chan, especially because I was mostly looking at \/b\/ and this is my first time ever on \/pol\/, does anyone have advice or any information that could help me understand this place? Like just say what the point of it is? Are there any big things happening and how do you know when it is? Thanks a lot, I know I must be an annoying &quot;newfag&quot; I guess. I don&#039;t even know how to greentext. I&#039;m no liberal though btw","filename":"IMG_4297","ext":".png","w":1136,"h":640,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1490251431513,"time":1490251431,"md5":"yprptMTW9StMUc6IcilstA==","fsize":685836,"resto":0,"id":"4N4vGzAp","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"im-a-normal-guy-and-recently-i-found-out-about","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

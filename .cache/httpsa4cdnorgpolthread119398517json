Aided by rebel group the Birkebeinerne (Birch Legs) who have vowed to protect the King, the Norwegian King fights for survival against the Church&#039;s Bishops, who seek to supplant the throne. On his deathbed after being poisoned, the King tells his loyal guards where to find his son, born in secrecy, as half the Kingdom wants him dead. Tasked with guarding the only remaining heir to the throne, two Birkebeinerne warriors, Skjervald and Torstein, find and escape with the infant and must traverse treacherous landscapes, murderous rivals, political plots and intrigues, and rouse an army of support to protect their future King.<br><br>Plenty of action, thrilling chase sequences on shaggy Icelandic ponies, sleds and skis, enough axe-hacking of bodies and a decent storyline. Some minor gratuitous sex, and plenty of cultural honor, integrity and loyalty.","filename":"MV5BZDJmZDliNmQtOTcxNC00OTEyLTkxMTMtZjAzYTk5ZTJlNGUzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjU0Mjc0MDA@._V1_SY1000_CR0,0,701,1000_AL_","ext":".jpg","w":701,"h":1000,"tn_w":175,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491262531248,"time":1491262531,"md5":"1pFb9XjL6i\/nU4+ZiwPWtw==","fsize":189307,"resto":0,"id":"mtytDGrX","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"political-movies-to-watch-right-now","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":119398895,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)19:38:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119398517\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119398517<\/a><br>saw it a couple weeks ago on (((netflix))) pretty good<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;also the current year<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;paying for netflix so they can fund more black on white couples in &quot;netflix original&quot; shows<\/span><br><br>go on tor go find alphabay and buy 100 netflix accounts for 5 dollars us","time":1491262703,"resto":119398517,"id":"OTd\/PBmO","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]}

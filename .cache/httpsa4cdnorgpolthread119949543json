I&#039;m discussing the reaction on social media platforms like kikebook. People don&#039;t have any real opinions that aren&#039;t fed to them by their kike globalist overlords. And the main theme of these opinions over the last 2 years is &quot;trump is ebil reeeeeee&quot;. I spend the last 2 years eviscerating them on threads that all their kike slave friends can see, so I figured maybe they would want some revenge, but like I said, they&#039;re too retarded.","time":1491575951,"resto":119949543,"id":"vuzsxPoL","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119958301,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)10:39:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"I warned yall bout letting him get the nuclear codes","time":1491575979,"resto":119949543,"id":"WifY1vhM","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119958359,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)10:39:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119957041\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119957041<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Remember the lefties after Obongo got elected?<\/span><br><br>He left office as an absurdly popular president and will likely be praised for generations by the left.","time":1491575997,"resto":119949543,"id":"vaaLh2kj","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119958689,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)10:41:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119958359\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119958359<\/a><br>Unfairly so.<br>His transparency that he would deliver turned out to be an absolute joke.

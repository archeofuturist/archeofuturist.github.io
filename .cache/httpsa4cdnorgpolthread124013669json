God is still the source for morality, but what &#039;God&#039; means to you might be different than what it means to me. I think He\/It created the universe, and indwelled us with consciousness, and maybe created the first cell (abiogenesis is too ridiculous for me), but I&#039;m agnostic about heaven\/hell, angels, demons, etc. I try to meditate twice a day, and pray that I will be changed, rather than the world. I see all religions as pointing towards the same &#039;oneness&#039; of reality, though they differ in the names they give things, and I think that Jesus is an utterly perplexing figure.

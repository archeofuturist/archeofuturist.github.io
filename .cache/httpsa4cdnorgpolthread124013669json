I&#039;ve smoked dmt 5 times and taken lsd at least a hundred times. I explored all the religions except Islam and Judaism, I arrived at orthodox christianity. The mystery of the faith is amazing and the ultimate goal is theosis or union with god. This is usually done through ascetic practices and prayer. There&#039;s hesyachism which is a mystical path to unity in god. There&#039;s also catholic mystics like st John of the cross or st Theresa of Avilla. The true faith is way to complicated to teach to the masses that can barely control their impulses. There&#039;s so much more to Christianity than what 90% of people know. Read the divine ladder of ascent, or st Johns ascent of Mt caramel and youll see what I mean. There&#039;s the carmalite order in catholicism which I bet you never even heard of.

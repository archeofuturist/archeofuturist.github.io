I&#039;ve smoked dmt 5 times and taken lsd at least a hundred times. I explored all the religions except Islam and Judaism, I arrived at orthodox christianity. The mystery of the faith is amazing and the ultimate goal is theosis or union with god. This is usually done through ascetic practices and prayer. There&#039;s hesyachism which is a mystical path to unity in god. There&#039;s also catholic mystics like st John of the cross or st Theresa of Avilla. The true faith is way to complicated to teach to the masses that can barely control their impulses. There&#039;s so much more to Christianity than what 90% of people know. Read the divine ladder of ascent, or st Johns ascent of Mt caramel and youll see what I mean. There&#039;s the carmalite order in catholicism which I bet you never even heard of.

Auto-generation, the &#039;Universe Created Itself&#039; would be the greatest case of Cause without effect ever.

They can bend anything at will, and see all. In this same way, God would be perfect to our universe. Perfect in origin, in volume, matter, energy, knowledge, etc, but our universe is very, very small. And so very, very limited. I&#039;m not setting the bar too high, just something capable of creating axioms, matter, energy, etc. Nothing in our observerable universe is capable of doing this. <br><br>God created our universe to find something out.

They are filled with evil knowledge from these entities. <br><br>Part of the reason \/pol is doing so well against these kikes is because Kek, and the other Egyptian gods that get channeled here like Thoth, are extremely powerful on the astral plane and strong totems against kike magic. If \/pol ever took the psychedelic redpill we could wage highly effective spiritual war on the astral plane directly. It&#039;s basically a world of memes instead of solid reality, \/pol is already halfway initiated into the ancient priesthood without knowing it which is why the Jew is so afraid of this place.","time":1493880355,"resto":124013669,"id":"15rxizYL","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124031440,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)02:46:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124031368\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124031368<\/a><br>oh and this idea is in the bible. read it. it&#039;s a collection of historical facts and undeniable wisdom. every word of it is true.","time":1493880376,"resto":124013669,"id":"wH6bla4h","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124031588,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)02:47:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124029740\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124029740<\/a><br>Doesn&#039;t eating human brain cause Kuru?

They demand to take away their status as refugee because they can&#039;t travel to Germany or Sweden for free gibs by making children. They don&#039;t care anyway and are now in Germany waiting for their status to be taken off and get status of refugee there&quot;<br><br>Thats&#039;s basicly all this article says. So can we speak about &quot;poor refugees runnig from war&quot; ?<br>There were 200 Syrian refugees in Poland and they all went to germany because of &quot;inhuman&quot; conditions. They were given free houses, education and fod but no, they want a lot of \u20ac in Germany or Sweden.

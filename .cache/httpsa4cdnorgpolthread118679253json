Another person, Sam (Sam has a large number of nephews and nieces, so we&#039;ll call him Uncle Sam), decides to stop Marvin from going to the marketplace using coercion. He goes down there with his M16 and blocks the road. As a result, Marvin can&#039;t trade for food and, as a result, he starves. So then the question is, did Sam kill Marvin? Did he violate his rights? Almost anyone would say yes, Sam acted wrongly. In fact, if Marvin died as a result, then Sam killed him. It wouldn&#039;t be that Sam failed to help Marvin. No, he actively intervened....This is analogous to the U.S. government&#039;s immigration policy. There are people who want to trade in our marketplace, in this case the labor market, and the government effectively prevents them from doing that, through use of force.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;pic related, there are no lines and borders from space.<\/span>","filename":"download (8)","ext":".jpg","w":275,"h":183,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1490726148010,"time":1490726148,"md5":"CEVGKeb3rHtHLEa9y7lc7g==","fsize":10717,"resto":0,"id":"tT6VxM2E","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"if-people-could-immigrate-anywhere-would-poverty","country_name":"United States","replies":6,"images":1,"unique_ips":7},{"no":118679662,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)14:39:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118679253\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118679253<\/a><br>instead what if we print infinite money and grow infinite food and purify all the ocean water and give ti all to everyone for free?","time":1490726351,"resto":118679253,"id":"gyZ8EQ9s","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118679714,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)14:39:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"first audit the federal reserve","time":1490726380,"resto":118679253,"id":"yxqzQMhX","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118679738,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)14:39:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"Pakis, Indians and blacks are still poor in Britain.

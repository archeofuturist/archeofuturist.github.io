With such a massive increase in the pool size there&#039;s no reason that premiums should have gone up that much. The democrats, as naive or misleading as they might have been, still would have done legitimate number crunching and it never showed such an increase in premiums. They started to happen all of the sudden and the excuses were vague.<br><br>Basically Obama forced us to buy into a corrupt industry and they had no shame in taking advantage of it.

One of the things people liked about trump was that he was perceived as a Washington outsider and yet here you are advocating for the sort of political dynasties that contibuted to fucking everything up, it was even one of the talking point against Clinton. Preventing this sort of bullshit is a good part of the reason we hold elections and appoint our own leaders in the first place. <br>Please just move to England and lick the Queens dusty old cunt instead of voting next time around if you are really this desperate to be a little bitch for royal families.","time":1491801819,"resto":120396216,"id":"vxfIIWMo","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120398602,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)01:29:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120397891\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120397891<\/a><br>It&#039;s r\/The_Donald anon.

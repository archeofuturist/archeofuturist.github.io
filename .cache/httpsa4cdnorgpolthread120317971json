They literally know all the exploits and bugs in all kinds of devices. How come? Why do THEY know about all these exploits, but some security software companies (producing antivirus software etc) don&#039;t? It&#039;s not like they would have much less experience?<br><br>Well, these agencies have a nearly unlimited budgets and are capable of employing the brightest hacker minds to work for them. It could be, these people are really so bright, or autistic, or both, they can literally outgun the experienced professionals from the security software companies in the skill of finding bugs.<br><br>Now: what will happen in the near future? In the recent years we saw major improvements in the area of AI. A sudden increase in research, actually. AI and neuronal nets were last developed in the 90&#039;s, and then it all just stayed more or less dormant until 2010&#039;s, with only a few advancements announced. Now we see a rapid grow in the technology, even hardware support for NN.<br><br>What can it mean for the tools used in software development to verify quality of code? Since a few decades we had tools like lint to analyze code for possible issues. What if in the next years we will see a rise in AI-driven code analysis tools? What if we see an improvement in their quality so massive that the code quality checking will make nearly every product hacking-proof? What if AI will outrun even 100% autistic people in the area of bug searching, diminishing any advantage CIA\/NSA had so far?<br><br>Will it mean the end to the secret agencies? What do you think?","filename":"almond-waves-activated","ext":".jpg","w":590,"h":282,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":119,"tim":1491763778322,"time":1491763778,"md5":"V0WjLZZnsqUcdhY9oPa1PA==","fsize":30130,"resto":0,"id":"xewt04io","country":"DE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"will-be-spy-agencies-stopped-by-ai","country_name":"Germany","replies":2,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":120320065,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)15:05:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120317971\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120317971<\/a><br>Counter-ai developed to search for bugs to fix<br><br>Done?","time":1491764740,"resto":120317971,"id":"lmi3CtEK","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120321361,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)15:14:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120320065\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120320065<\/a><br>wut?","time":1491765296,"resto":120317971,"id":"xewt04io","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"}]}

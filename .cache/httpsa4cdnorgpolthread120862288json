A national citizens&#039; militia must be formed in order to maintain our own system of defence against NATO forces and possible foreign invaders. Once a country or area becomes autonomous, there are inevitably hostile authoritarian agencies interested in taking over that country or area. Once our autonomy has been gained, it is our prerogative to protect it.<br>2. Hospitals, the health service and essential services will be collectively run.<br>3. The monetary system will be abolished. The Yanks can stuff their gold up their Grande Canyon!<br>4. All trade with America and South Africa will be indefinitely canceled. Trade with other nations may be undertaken utilising a system of bartering. Money and gold-related currencies will already be obsolete. Economists can be issued with beer to cry in.<br>5. Boring, laborious but necessary jobs will be undertaken by all able, capable people on 3 rota so that no one has to do any unpleasant work for too long.<br>6. Industry will be organized by workers&#039; councils and ultimately run by the workers themselves.<br>7. Community education schemes must be put into operation. Young people must be allowed to take the opportunity to learn what interests them. Compulsory education will be banned. While help and special treatment may be necessary for handicapped people, they should be brought up along with able-bodied people in a natural environment.<br>8. Communal child-rearing and non-nuclear families should be available and encouraged.<br>9. The slaughter of animals for vivisection and human consumption will be abolished. Those found guilty of an offence under this act must face sentence of death.","filename":"210423_10150151305501901_322276441900_7076065_2390075_o","ext":".jpg","w":1600,"h":895,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":139,"tim":1492055243781,"time":1492055243,"md5":"oXSp8GDrAQnMH4B5D8XYnA==","fsize":388038,"resto":0,"id":"mapeZWNh","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"what-will-you-do-after-the-revolution","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

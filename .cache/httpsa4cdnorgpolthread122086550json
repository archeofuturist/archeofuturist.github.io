Take it upon yourself to call people out when they do shitty things. Shame is perfectly fine, so shame them about being an autist instead of enjoying and appreciating a nice family experience.","time":1492748760,"resto":122086550,"id":"EGoGAtIg","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122095923,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)00:30:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122094073\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122094073<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;disable internet in house<\/span><br><br>They have mobile data.

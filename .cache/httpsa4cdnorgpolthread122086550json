It&#039;s one thing to check a text or google something related to conversation but you have to be autistic not to realize that staring at your phone all dinner (at home or out at a restaurant) is extremely rude and degenerate. Every children can imagine why completely ignoring everything and everyone around them is rude. <br><br>Western society is crumbling and it&#039;s shit like this that proves it. Take it upon yourself to call people out when they do shitty things. Shame is perfectly fine, so shame them about being an autist instead of enjoying and appreciating a nice family experience.","time":1492748760,"resto":122086550,"id":"EGoGAtIg","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122095923,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)00:30:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122094073\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122094073<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;disable internet in house<\/span><br><br>They have mobile data.

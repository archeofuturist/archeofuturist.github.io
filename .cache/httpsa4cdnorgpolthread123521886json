This happened during the siege of Vienna in 1683, where Serban was at the head of a contingent of four thousand Wallachians in the army of Cara Mustapha, and duty was entrusted to him of constructing bridges and works. He took advantage of his position to communicate with the Germans, facilitated the destruction of the works which he himself had raised, and it is said that he loaded his guns with straw. He is said also to have erected a high cross opposite his tent, on which an inscription was graven capable of bearing a double interpretation, and which gave courage to the besieged. After the defeat of the Turks before Vienna through its relief by Sobieski, King of Poland, [203] Serban fostered the idea of asserting his independence of Turkish rule; but before he was able to carry his plans into execution, he died (1688), it is said, poisoned by his brother and nephew.","time":1493587781,"resto":123521886,"id":"YY4z+ho4","country":"RO","country_name":"Romania"},{"no":123530145,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)17:33:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123528796\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123528796<\/a><br><a href=\"#p123529655\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123529655<\/a><br>Are all Romanians this delusional?","time":1493588004,"resto":123521886,"id":"eGe3ICcC","country":"AT","country_name":"Austria"},{"no":123530506,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)17:36:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123527609\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123527609<\/a><br>Proxy or Diaspora?","time":1493588172,"resto":123521886,"id":"V93XWcSX","country":"BE","country_name":"Belgium"},{"no":123530815,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)17:38:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123522672\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123522672<\/a><br>Remember how you backstabbed us ~100 years later?","time":1493588314,"resto":123521886,"id":"0BkmKA3u","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":123531105,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)17:40:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123523400\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123523400<\/a><br>the cuck story of vlad&#039;s twink brother always makes me hard desu","filename":"radu","ext":".jpg","w":720,"h":405,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1493588455147,"time":1493588455,"md5":"lYx6KEFPQvdkIbh24FApvg==","fsize":38831,"resto":123521886,"id":"rGfAf+U7","country":"TR","country_name":"Turkey"},{"no":123531116,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)17:41:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123530145\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123530145<\/a><br>You can&#039;t accept historical facts?<br><br>Even kikepdia agrees with history books on this subject. <br><br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/%C8%9<wbr>8erban_Cantacuzino<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;He took part in the Ottoman campaign ending in their defeat at the Battle of Vienna.[1] At the same time, it is alleged that he conceived a plan for a march on Constantinople, planning to drive the Ottomans out of Europe, counting on support from major European states.<\/span>","time":1493588461,"resto":123521886,"id":"YY4z+ho4","country":"RO","country_name":"Romania"},{"no":123531485,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)17:44:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123531105\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123531105<\/a><br>From two brothers one has to be a retard.

Obviously, when it comes to things like theft or drug possession\/drug distribution or what have you, you shouldn&#039;t collaborate with the pigs. But what about a hypothetical situation where it might benefit innocent people more than it would benefit the cops? For example, there is a serial killer on the loose, and for whatever reason, you have evidence and\/or knowledge that can be very helpful to catching the killer. As an anarchist, is it justifiable to provide this information to the cops (at least anonymously), just so it might prevent the deaths of innocent people?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The only people that I personally would ever call the cops on are fascists. That&#039;s a no lose scenario.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Haha i actually like this idea. Facsist vs. Fascist.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Wouldn&#039;t call the cops with a gun to my head.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Never. Fuck them. I will say and people tend to disagree with on this but I believe we should use the law as a weapon. Use the system against itself. The current 4chan problem got me thinking about ways to fuck with them and stop them and honestly the best I can come up with is hit them with lawsuits for doxxing to get them shut down (also posting interracial porn makes them furious but thats besides the point).<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The thing I&#039;d say is it&#039;s easy to think of hypotheticals where calling the police would be helpful (and often these hypotheticals are based on cultural reference points that are basically pro-cop propaganda), but how easy is it to think of a real world experience where getting the cops involved is better than one of the many alternatives. And how many examples can you think of where people have called the police and got a positive outcome?<\/span>","filename":"c4","ext":".jpg","w":549,"h":604,"tn_w":227,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492892746807,"time":1492892746,"md5":"maXu+fRB0SCI\/5NjuqI8yA==","fsize":56486,"resto":0,"id":"ljlhYVYJ","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"is-there-any-situation-where-collaborating-with","country_name":"United States","replies":4,"images":1,"unique_ips":4},{"no":122322747,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)16:27:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Dear Brigadiers and Alt-Right troll accounts.

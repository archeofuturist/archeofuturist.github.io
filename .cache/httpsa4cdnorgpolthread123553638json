Midwest. <br><br>I only very recently got back into the faith after having left when I was around 9 or 10.

It was so weird but I just knew that if I didn&#039;t somehow get to confession soon then I was going to die and go straight to Hell and I knew I deserved it. But yesterday the Priest told me I was forgiven and today I had Communion and now I realize that God was never accusing me or hating me at all. Satan was attacking me, and God was just gently trying to lead me to where I could get right again. I know people gloss over Confession a lot, but that&#039;s the most miraculous thing in the world. I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s sacriligious or whatever for me to say this, but I think Reconciliation is even more miraculous than the Transubstantiation. The fact that He can just forgive sins like that, just that easy... it&#039;s unfathomable.","time":1493601462,"resto":123553638,"id":"1PkrMDTj","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123557032,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)21:19:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123556637\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123556637<\/a><br>catholic bros are okayish, Anglican is closet catholic, but 90% of Lutheran churches and the like just need to kinda go.

The married person fears they are worthless without constantly feeding their ego through causal sex. The middle aged person feels as if they are becoming worthless, because they are loosing sexual appeal. Even beautiful people, beleive it or not, are afraid they are not having enough sex to satisfy society&#039;s expectation of them.

Whether you would use the recovery for lust is irrelevant--God created man and woman in the beginning even though he knew they would sin and cause his Son to have to die. Fear not. Commit everything to God--body, soul, mind. Place your life, your despair, your future, in his hands. He will show you the way and you will suffer, but you will know Him in His suffering thereby. Read the servant songs of Isaiah 53-54, and in the gospels particularly the episode of the gerasene demoniac.

The fact that you still desire women in your soul, even if your body is afflicted, shows me that this is not an insurmountable mountain.

I will run you down some basics, however. Coming from a Catholic:<br><br>Mortal sin is the name for sins that lead to damnation. This is a direct separation of interests between you and God&#039;s will. For something to be a mortal sin it needs to be:<br><br>1. A grave matter<br>2. It needs to have been done with full knowledge\/awareness of the gravity of it.<br>3. It needs to have been done with deliberate consent.<br><br>Suicide is a grave matter. For moral offenses such as suicide, awareness is considered a given as God&#039;s moral law is innate to us. And with illnesses, such as depression, it the gravity of the offense can be alleviated if it was truly something beyond your will putting you into the situation and not something your will agreed to.<br><br>I cannot readily say you would be forgiven for such an act as it seems, by how you speak of this, that this is your willful decision and so the guilt would lay with you and you have no visible sign of interest in repenting of such an action. <br><br>None of us can say what God plans for you and so we cannot promise or tell what will become of your struggle. But we do know that what suffering comes is a method towards growth. In various means. It could allow an important good, it could be a preparation, it could break your heart so that it be more open, it could be a method of transformation, or it even could be repercussions of sins playing out to persuade you away from something.<br><br>We do not seek God to try to relieve suffering by attempting to escape it but relieve it by overcoming it. And in that we are united with the suffering of our God, who has suffered with us.<br><br>God bless you Anon.

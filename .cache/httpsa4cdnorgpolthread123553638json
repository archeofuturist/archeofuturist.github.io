It was so weird but I just knew that if I didn&#039;t somehow get to confession soon then I was going to die and go straight to Hell and I knew I deserved it. But yesterday the Priest told me I was forgiven and today I had Communion and now I realize that God was never accusing me or hating me at all. Satan was attacking me, and God was just gently trying to lead me to where I could get right again. I know people gloss over Confession a lot, but that&#039;s the most miraculous thing in the world. I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s sacriligious or whatever for me to say this, but I think Reconciliation is even more miraculous than the Transubstantiation. The fact that He can just forgive sins like that, just that easy... it&#039;s unfathomable.","time":1493601462,"resto":123553638,"id":"1PkrMDTj","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123557032,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)21:19:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123556637\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123556637<\/a><br>catholic bros are okayish, Anglican is closet catholic, but 90% of Lutheran churches and the like just need to kinda go.

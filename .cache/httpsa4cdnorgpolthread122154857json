Then I had the displeasure of reading Intellectuals and Race by Thomas Sowell.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;inb4 &quot;nigger trying to deny genetics&quot;<\/span><br><br>On the contrary my \/pol\/ster friend, I was satisfied with thay conclusion because it practically gave me an excuse to accept how my people are. We&#039;re barbarians because that is how we are hard wired...or so I thought.<br><br>Sowell explains, with evidence, that there are three main factors when it comes to races and how they advance and act: geography, trade, and culture\/society. Blacks, at least in africa, had the excuse of lacking in trade (which exposes your people various advancements), geography somewhat (yes africa is rich in resources but the big ass desert and lack of beast of burden are some examples) and a culture that dances around fire to make it rain explains why they are so far behind.<br><br>But for some reason, blacks in western civilizations are advancing much slower than other groups. Hell in some areas, we&#039;re slipping backwards. Why? We have access to all three of those advancements so what is wrong?<br><br>Simple: we fucking want to be ignorant. We cling to the past and our horrific culture as if it is the entire purpose of our race. We choose this barbarism. Native Americans have the same problem.<br><br>I wish I knew how to fix this problem, I really do. But until blacks learn to let go of the past, shit is not going to change. Until then, we will continue killing, raping, stealing, and leeching off others until civilization is drained.<br><br>Slavery was a mistake. Not because it was a horrible injustice against humanity but because Africans were not ready for Western civilization.","filename":"asowell_zps0c91b6c5","ext":".gif","w":375,"h":359,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":239,"tim":1492792778586,"time":1492792778,"md5":"H5z26IPVdVemoA+88dE7EQ==","fsize":85610,"resto":0,"id":"cs1zIWia","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"i-wish-genetic-difference-was-the-reason-why","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":122155295,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)12:44:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122154857\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122154857<\/a><br>What Black people need is an authoritarian leader to force them to abandon their shitty way of life, install discipline and good family values.

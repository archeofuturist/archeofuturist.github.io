They could have tweaked it a bit to make it obama care light, but that would have been dumb. Trump is actually sticking to his health care plan, it&#039;s just going to take longer than we all thought. Long term this will be awesome because obamacare will explode and they&#039;ll tweak their plan even more after that. True conservatism and constitutionalism is on it&#039;s way.

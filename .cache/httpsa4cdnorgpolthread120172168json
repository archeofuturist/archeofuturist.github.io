They say there&#039;s no doubt it was Sarin, which they say can only come from the Syrian Government because it is too difficult to produce, but they are conveniently leaving out that:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;It was confirmed that 100% of Syrias chemical weapon stores and production were dismantled and removed from Syria(This is a big point because I have yet to see a SINGLE mention of this in the media)<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;There was a previous Sarin attack attributed to rebels in the past, also claimed to be from Assad at the time but later proven to be false<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The people treating the &quot;Sarin&quot; victims are wearing no protective gear, which they say is explained because the Sarin has degraded from improper storage or manufacture so it is impure(which itself is indicative of production by rebels)<\/span><br>Now also we have this British Chemical Warfare Expert saying that it&#039;s impossible for the Syrian airstrike to have triggered a Sarin exposure because &quot;The explosions from the bombs would have destroyed the chemical agents&quot;. Well this is fucking retarded because it relies on assumptions of how it went down:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;That the bombs were a direct hit on the depot and thus completely destroyed the chemical lab\/storage in a full blast(good luck when your using such old planes and dumb bombs) rather than an indirect hit without incineration<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;That the terrorist&#039;s didn&#039;t see this as an opportunity\/know about the strike ahead of time(perhaps leaked the location of the depot) and had already prepared a release of chemical agents(which makes sense considering the supposed degradation\/impurity of the agent if you believe that)<\/span><br>So wouldn&#039;t it be just as likely(if not more so) for the bomb to have weakened the structural integrity(say, knock down a wall) of the lab\/storage site and release the agents with the pressure wave then to completely incinerate all of it in the blast? I mean it&#039;s such a joke that no one has brought any of this up on the news.","filename":"1491532587748","ext":".jpg","w":571,"h":800,"tn_w":178,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491680247738,"time":1491680247,"md5":"H+QMx7\/uauOdjaMQhM4Hzg==","fsize":128733,"resto":0,"id":"QClOyVIJ","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"so-many-questions-and-all-the-answers-are-coming","country_name":"Canada","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

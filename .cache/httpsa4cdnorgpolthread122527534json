On board, there are people crying for help: they are all getting murdered by 3 people. These 3 people happen to be an ISIS terrorist, a Somali pirate, and a Mexican druglord. Since everyone is now killed and you&#039;re the only non-threatening passenger left, you are forced to ally yourself with 1 of the 3 genociders in order to save yourself. If you don&#039;t, they will all team up on you and kill you instead. There is also a 4th person that was imprisoned by the now dead captain and is still possibly alive, but you cannot get to him as of this moment. You have to survive somehow. What do you do in the current situation? You have nothing on you aside from your passport, suitcase, and clothes on your back.","filename":"LonelyShip","ext":".jpg","w":1920,"h":1080,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1493000168760,"time":1493000168,"md5":"\/ayrBlKWD7RlHQGo81G5og==","fsize":763573,"resto":0,"id":"2ht0iKp3","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"decision-storytime-for-pol","country_name":"United States","replies":11,"images":2,"unique_ips":6},{"no":122527755,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)22:18:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"sa ge in options. \/b\/, you fucking faggots","time":1493000281,"resto":122527534,"id":"bHX1Uxp0","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122527901,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)22:19:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122527755\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122527755<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;muh sage<\/span><br>Go away please.","time":1493000358,"resto":122527534,"id":"2ht0iKp3","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122528110,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)22:21:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"Maybe the drug lord.

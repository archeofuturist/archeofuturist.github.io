We had sovereign states that unified into one country, and those states were a lot more similar in character to each other than the European states are to each other, but in today&#039;s world when most Europeans know or care little about their own histories I fail to see how said histories can be so divisive that Europeans can&#039;t form a single empire. <br><br>In the US, each state has different laws and customs to a degree, but they can unify under a federal body. Despite the differences you refer to, I still think Europeans can do a similar thing but with a greater amount of sovereignty to each state. It would have to be developed under fundamentally different terms than the EU that we know of now, and by different people (not Jews or traitorous Europeans), but it would give a power to Europe that would render any attempt to subvert any European population nearly impossible.

It has been suggested that originally all Polish coats of arms were based on such abstract geometrical shapes, but most were gradually &quot;rationalized&quot; into horseshoes, arrows and so on. If this hypothesis is correct, it suggests in turn that Polish heraldry, also unlike Western European heraldry, may be at least partly derived from tamgas. However, the evidence about the origins of the system is scanty, and this hypothesis has been criticized as being part of the Polish noble tradition of romanticizing their supposed Sarmatian ancestry.

The use of cannabis to induce trance and divination by soothsayers was a characteristic of the Scythian belief system..<br><br>The term Arya is used in ancient Persian texts, for example in the behistun inscription from the 5th century BCE, in which the Persian kings Darius the Great and Xerxes are described as &quot;Aryans of Aryan stock&quot; (arya arya chi\u00e7a). The inscription also refers to the deity Ahura Mazda as &quot;the god of the Aryans&quot;, and to the ancient Persian language as &quot;Aryan&quot;. In this sense the word seems to have referred to the elite culture of the ancient Iranians, including both linguistic, cultural and religious aspects.

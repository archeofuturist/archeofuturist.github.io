Those places include Poland and Areas around modern day Iran\/North India\/Irak\/Afghanistan. <br><br>In the last thread, an anon also said that in Poland, at one point in time, aristocrats often believed that they came from areas closer to modern day Iran and Persia. <br><br>Could there be some essence to this? Are Poles the Ultimate Aryans who came from Iran and other places mentioned above?","filename":"r1a","ext":".jpg","w":900,"h":506,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1492284689169,"time":1492284689,"md5":"jMG04V9cncTr39vtqQL8CQ==","fsize":82055,"resto":0,"id":"Fna4GdeM","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"r1a-are-poles-the-ultimate-aryansiranians","country_name":"Canada","replies":4,"images":1,"unique_ips":3},{"no":121248918,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)15:32:26","name":"Anonymous","filename":"Screen Shot 2017-04-15 at 1.31.46 PM","ext":".png","w":1004,"h":1198,"tn_w":104,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492284746202,"time":1492284746,"md5":"4S\/nlNyBkL1LLFgBjxSLuw==","fsize":2709327,"resto":121248807,"id":"Fna4GdeM","country":"CA","m_img":1,"country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121249011,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)15:33:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121248807\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121248807<\/a><br>The Ultimate Aryans are Jews, East Asians, Sikhs and Anglos.

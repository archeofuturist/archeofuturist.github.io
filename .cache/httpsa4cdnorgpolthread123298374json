All I ever see on here is bitching. <br><br>Don&#039;t like SJWs? Become a fucking governor and twist their heels throughout office. Inaction is assured defeat, and if you don&#039;t like losing then learn how to play the game. Our governmental system is perfectly set up for you to get your way if you work hard at getting it, and in the cases it&#039;s not life is more than equipped to offer you a fighting chance in this wild world. The government isn&#039;t god and the shadow government isn&#039;t all powerful, both merely act upon your inactivity. By being complacent you are giving them full consent to do whatever the hell they want.","filename":"1487883224855","ext":".jpg","w":777,"h":1000,"tn_w":194,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493442314569,"time":1493442314,"md5":"yTvJwwNr14WZWm61fi0+1w==","fsize":231569,"resto":0,"id":"SupYMyPS","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"stop-bitching","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":123298595,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)01:08:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"You know, he&#039;s right.

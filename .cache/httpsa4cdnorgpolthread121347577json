Think of shit martini stirrers and nazi concentration camps being proving ground where they were testing some sort of social weapons of mass destruction. If you think about those nazi concentration camps were paradise on earth - melting pot of multiculturalism. So after WWII they performed operation paperclip for those rocket scientists, their big data and started implementing this science into open society. Notice UN and EU all policies are organized about such phrases as cohesion, global compact, etc.. Every individual is different culture. Magnet. You put them too close together - you can only expect big bangs. So CIA homos are playing very interesting games.","time":1492343161,"resto":121347577,"id":"CR1Hvkmj","country":"LT","country_name":"Lithuania"}]}

Thaddeus acknowledged that race is a social construct but also that absolutely what we socially identify as white or black have IQ differences and there exists various other differences in humans that we socially identify as other races. <br><br>Is it possible to acknowledge that race as we know is very hard to pin down with biological \/ scientific markers but people who socially identify as white \/ black share common traits with those they identify with? I find it hard to really disprove cultural marxists on that fact that race is socially constructed but that doesn&#039;t then imply that we can \/ should flood our countries with unassimilable people of completely foreign cultures because &quot;muhhh race is a social construct meme&quot;. <br><br>basically, can you be a white nationalist and fight against the displacement of your people without saying that race is something that can be defined scientifically and is more culture and collective views on the world?","filename":"Social-construct","ext":".jpg","w":310,"h":306,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":246,"tim":1493604599381,"time":1493604599,"md5":"JsEOITCr6Rog\/tY2cAoctw==","fsize":34425,"resto":0,"id":"armERtHB","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"interesting-subject","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

People like Mr.Peterson are already sorted out, the world they live in has not had it&#039;s chances complety destroyed by a predatory migration crisis trying to replace your genepool. Peterson didn&#039;t attend colleges that took away points from your tests to give them to another individual of a different racial group because of arbitrary policies. When Mr.Peterson went out to look for a job, there were no minority quotas, or &quot;womyn empowerment&quot; at the expense of male counterparts. Mr.Peterson is completely aware of the grand plans of our political elites, and how they plan to send us into a meat-grinder, t any moment they choose, rendering our plans null and void. Mr. Peterson when out to find a mate, didin&#039;t have to wade trough the gutter of brainwashed psycothic narcisistic western females to find a good girl amongst the trash and the freeloaders. He&#039;s a boomer, good intentioned, but complety lacking in self-awareness when trying to give counsel that worked 30 years ago in a completely different environment to a generation his generation made sure to put as many social obstacles about as they could.<br><br>He&#039;s just a higly intelligent boomer who substituted &quot;man up!&quot;, &quot;just find a job!&quot; with &quot;sort yourself out!&quot;.

While Obama was still in office, right-wing\/nationalist viewpoints were becoming more acceptable and mainstream. The ridiculousless of the left was pushing more people to the right. But now that the GOP has a majority in all branches of government, it feels like our cultural capital has hit its peak and is now rapidly declining. I fear that moderates and being pushed more to the left now.","filename":"1458017800070","ext":".jpg","w":1688,"h":1125,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1492572631832,"time":1492572631,"md5":"NX0v3anQnnM0DPtLjSPLaw==","fsize":886171,"resto":0,"id":"JLEL7GFg","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"would-it-have-been-better-for-the-rightwing","country_name":"United States","replies":6,"images":0,"unique_ips":7},{"no":121795111,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)23:35:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"No, Hillary wanted full amnesty for all illegals, which would have completely solidified the nation demographically as permanently blue and more and more left wing.","time":1492572929,"resto":121794554,"id":"NW4yBNV9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121797964,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)00:00:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"Republicans couldn&#039;t afford even one more Democrat Presidential term, the damage would&#039;ve been irreversible at this point. Trump won by less than 1% in some very key states for him, as in as little as a 10,000\u201350,000 voter lead each. The rust belt flip was the one thing that snagged him the victory. If Hillary eked it out, the Democrats could&#039;ve patched that little leak and made it game over forever with Republican strongholds continuing to become bluer. Trump is probably the most significant presidency in your lifetime, and couldn&#039;t have been more timely. In a game of hot potato, we tossed it at the very last possible second and the benefits couldn&#039;t be bigger. With the H-1B executive order tonight, there&#039;s no doubt Trump is the real deal. We&#039;re only a few months in and he&#039;s hitting the ground running. Worst case scenario, it&#039;s going to take Democrats decades to undo the damage he&#039;s doing to their agenda and our fight continues. At best, Democrats pushed their luck for too long and our culture is going to continue to galvanize the white voting bloc into putting an end to this once and for all.","time":1492574434,"resto":121794554,"id":"PS\/kpTsC","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121798280,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)00:03:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121794554\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121794554<\/a><br>Fuck you, winning is better.","time":1492574591,"resto":121794554,"id":"m0YvIYmR","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121798696,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)00:06:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121794554\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121794554<\/a><br>No. <br><br>Because then we would suffer the illusion of &quot;if Trump won everything would&#039;ve been great&quot;.<br><br>Now we know he&#039;s a Kike too and in the US nothing will change by democracy.","time":1492574802,"resto":121794554,"id":"nM1o1ys+","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":121799630,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)00:14:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121794554\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121794554<\/a><br><br>Of course not, in addition to what&#039;s already been a Hillary win would have meant a minimum of two democratic appointments to the Supreme Court.

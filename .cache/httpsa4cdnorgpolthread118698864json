In recent elections, however, it\u2019s ballooned, with AT&amp;T, Comcast, and Verizon each giving one of their favorite politicians in Congress between $15,000 and $20,000 every two years. All told, Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), author of a controversial resolution to let internet providers sell customers\u2019 search histories to advertisers without notice or permission, has racked up well over half a million dollars in campaign donations from that industry over the course of her career.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Privacy advocates are resoundingly against the resolution, designed to undo rules created by President Obama\u2019s Federal Communications Commission in the waning days of his administration. The rules mandated internet providers like Comcast and Verizon get customers\u2019 permission before offering sensitive search histories, like financial and health information, to marketers.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; \u201cThe only ones who are fighting against the rules and fighting against the FCC\u2019s privacy jurisdiction are the companies directly or the companies represented by CTIA,\u201d a wireless trade group, and other groups like it, Laura Moy, Deputy Director of Georgetown University Law\u2019s Center on Privacy and Technology, previously told Vocativ.<\/span><br> <span class=\"quote\">&gt;Blackburn didn\u2019t respond to request for an explanation of how the resolution could directly help consumers. <\/span><br> All your data are belong to us, Goys.","filename":"1477339914978","ext":".jpg","w":750,"h":910,"tn_w":206,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490736321230,"time":1490736321,"md5":"9T0bdn34EStwWPJGBQU63Q==","fsize":95339,"resto":0,"id":"knOYkRdO","country":"IL","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"house-rep-pushing-to-set-back-online-privacy","country_name":"Israel","replies":3,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":118698937,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)17:25:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"me on the left","time":1490736359,"resto":118698864,"id":"44zwoYiu","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":118699115,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)17:27:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"In the US, a politician will write a law that hurts the American people for no reason whatsoever except that some entity paid him\/her.","time":1490736445,"resto":118698864,"id":"knOYkRdO","country":"IL","country_name":"Israel"},{"no":118699199,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)17:28:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"Wow!

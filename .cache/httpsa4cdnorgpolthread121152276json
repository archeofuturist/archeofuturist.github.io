Perfectly planned despite Trump&#039;s busy schedule he knew this shit could not be taken lightly. <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Trump gives an aggressive, and firm handshake. Xi already knew this would happen and responded back in the same manner. A bond is formed, only men could understand this. <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Immediately begins negotations on trade and North Korea, doesn&#039;t hesitate, goes straight to the point<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Trump knew North Korea made a bunch of new threats recently, and used that against Xi in the meeting because it was the most powerful top of discussion in the meeting. Read art of the Deal. <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Meeting was supposed to be only an hour, nothing was supposed to really be accomplished other than aquanting each other<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Instead, meeting lasts 5 hours. Shit actually gets done. Trump makes reasonable offers, instead of sensely bickering like the nigger. Doesn&#039;t go all the way, and didn&#039;t bargain for too much. Again, this man is a genius at bargaining. <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The two parties have dinner. Trump&#039;s grandaughters sing to the Chinese president in Chinese. Xi is impressed that Trump gives a shit about China and Chinese culture. <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The two president&#039;s wives also meet and discuss silly women shit. Melania, being the polite women that she is, leaves a good impression.<\/span>","time":1492222091,"resto":121152276,"id":"JbT+LwSk","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121152523,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)22:08:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121152276\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121152276<\/a><br>Meanwhile Trump managed to get nork coal and possibly now oil cut off.","time":1492222128,"resto":121152276,"id":"Ig6Q5g8I","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121152662,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)22:10:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121152441\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121152441<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;North Korean may finally collapse freeing millions<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Coal exports will increase, revitalizing many parts of the country<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;To Be Continued..<\/span>","time":1492222200,"resto":121152276,"id":"JbT+LwSk","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121153028,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)22:13:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"bumping for SB rants","time":1492222386,"resto":121152276,"id":"ZORKVPfu","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121153057,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)22:13:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"Wow OP you didn&#039;t make any of this up.

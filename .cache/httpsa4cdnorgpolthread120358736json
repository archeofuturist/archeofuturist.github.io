Take it medically for my anxiety, PTSD and depression. 15 years of prescription meds and all kinds of doctors has gotten me nowhere so I finally bit the bullet and decided to see a doctor for a card, got it, and have been experimenting ever since. I&#039;m a shut-in &amp; don&#039;t really know what I&#039;m doing but every time I&#039;ve smoked so far it&#039;s hit me like a ton of bricks. Everything from hallucinations (very vivid lucid dreams out of nowhere, rather) to rolling around on the floor typing gibberish into my phone to massive anxiety\/paranoia to the total opposite; no anxiety or misery or memories ruling my life and a clear head and the ability to recognize and pursue what truly matters. It&#039;s that last one I&#039;m chasing.

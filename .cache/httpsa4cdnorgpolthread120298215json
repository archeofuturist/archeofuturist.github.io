The idea was originally spread around \/r\/esist and other anti trump Redd1ts. Shareblue has been studying \/pol\/ since almost immediately after the 2016 election. They have learned \/pols\/ &quot;language&quot; and are teaching others how to &quot;mimic&quot; or. They have several hundred screenshots of threads and posts, mostly pertaining to the election. Some of you have already seen the Discord group it has, but they also have many other group chats such as Skype and even some private forums. The tactics are simple, post anti trump\/pro Assad\/&quot;why has trump failed us&quot; type threads and have mass amounts of people comment similar things. That is why if you call them out as &quot;shariablue&quot; they reply with either &quot;go back to redd1t&quot; or &quot;CTR&quot; or something along the lines. We were told to do so. We were told that any attempt at &quot;exposing&quot; them were to be filled with &quot;go back to redd1ts&quot; &quot;larper&quot; or just spam with gore\/random derailing posts. It may seem like simple child antics, but trust me \/pol\/ they are playing 6D tri demnsional chess","filename":"74780042-0711-4EE9-A816-9E75829BC0B1-5294-00000396F70B9C91","ext":".jpg","w":1366,"h":768,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1491753998068,"time":1491753998,"md5":"Xq6Tcus\/aGdugUYtoOKuLA==","fsize":56894,"resto":0,"id":"aOOXiLCe","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":1,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"shariablue-general","country_name":"United States","replies":301,"images":86,"unique_ips":120,"tail_size":50},{"no":120298395,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)12:08:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120298215\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120298215<\/a><br><a href=\"\/r\/catalog#s=eddit\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;&gt;\/r\/eddit<\/a>","time":1491754087,"resto":120298215,"id":"bfnFgIuH","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120298417,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)12:08:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"Proof of contact?<br>I want to believe but not without proof","time":1491754098,"resto":120298215,"id":"jjvEg2Y4","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120298435,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)12:08:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"nice try t_d, go back to your jew sucking subreddit","time":1491754105,"resto":120298215,"id":"oH3628gb","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120298540,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)12:09:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120298395\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120298395<\/a><br><a href=\"#p120298435\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120298435<\/a><br>This should be proof enough <a href=\"#p120298417\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120298417<\/a>","time":1491754157,"resto":120298215,"id":"aOOXiLCe","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120298563,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)12:09:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"Do you actually think anyone is falling for your lies?

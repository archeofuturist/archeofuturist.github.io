There&#039;s no cities to capture, crops to burn, or otherwise put any means of effective pressure on them, outside of open battle, which in most cases was fought on their terms. If you decide to hold up in a castle, they&#039;ll either just go somewhere else or just continue raiding the country side, hurting your ability to continue to wage war in the long term. There was no hard defense for much of history against such tactics. Quite often the case was also that the Mongols played off factions against each other for their own gain.

If you really believe what you&#039;re saying, why did you post Chris Johnson&#039;s talk refuting the BoM? If you&#039;re just playing devil&#039;s advocate to keep the discussion going, then godspeed, anon.<\/span><br><br>Yeah I was playing devils advocate, partly because it teaches you good skills and for the most part because whilst there are really good criticisms of the Mormons most people dont use them and rely on dishonest memey ones. What I was hoping to do was show otheres through our conversation that its not as clear cut as it seems and how people who arent gullible can still believe in it.","time":1493707726,"resto":123721223,"id":"MFhVIYQa","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":123739015,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)02:49:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"It&#039;s literally a freemasonic Mystery religion lite for the goiym","time":1493707749,"resto":123721223,"id":"WNv5GKZ\/","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":123739198,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)02:51:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123722591\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123722591<\/a><br>mormonism is just a limited hangout for freemasons with a bunch of CIA agents<br><br>degenerate trash","time":1493707872,"resto":123721223,"id":"eagkUvGR","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123739601,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)02:56:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123738780\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123738780<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;we don&#039;t have any contradicting claims by anyone else<\/span><br><br>We do, by the man who translated them himself and had the most experience with them and in part the book of mormon when it describes their construction being from ore\/<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;That still creates the same problems though.

In Idaho, for example, a 2-million-year-old clay figurine was unearthed in 1912. But even this discovery does not mark an outer limit. Bones, vertebrae and even complete skeletons have been found in Italy, Argentina and Kenya. Their minimum datings range from 3 million to 4 million years. A human skull, a partial human skeleton and a collection of neoliths discovered in California have been dated in excess of 5 million years. A human skeleton discovered at Midi in France, paleoliths found in Portugal, Burma and Argentina, a carved bone and flint flakes from Turkey all have a minimum age of 5 million years.<br>How far back can human history be pushed with discoveries like these? The answer seems to be a great deal further than orthodox science currently allows. As if the foregoing discoveries were not enough, we need to take account of:<br>* Paleoliths from France dated between 7 and 9 million years<br>* An eolith from India with a minimum dating of 9 million years<br>* Incised bones from France, Argentina and Kenya no less than 12 million years old<br>* More paleolith discoveries from France, dated at least 20 million years ago<br>* Neoliths from California in excess of 23 million years<br>* Three different kinds of paleoliths from Belgium with a minimum dating of 26 million years<br>* An anatomically modern human skeleton, neoliths and carved stones found at the Table Mountain, California and dated at least 33 million years ago<br>But even 33 million years is not the upper limit. A human skeleton found in Switzerland is estimated to be between 38 and 45 million years old. France has yielded up eoliths, paleoliths, cut wood and a chalk ball, the minimum ages of which range from 45 to 50 million years.<br>There&#039;s still more.","time":1492094744,"resto":120915295,"id":"BVDq0gTn","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":120917005,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)10:45:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120916654\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120916654<\/a><br>by the way, when that picture came emerged, there suddenly was a campange started to talk about how that picture of the civil war with a pterosaur is fake in the newspapers.

In 1983, the Moscow News reported the discovery of a fossilised human footprint next to the fossil footprint of a three-toed dinosaur in the Turkamen Republic. Dinosaurs have been extinct for approximately 65 million years.<br>In 1983, Professor W. G. Burroughs of Kentucky reported the discovery of three pairs of fossil tracks dated to 300 million years ago. They showed left and right footprints. Each print had five toes and a distinct arch. The toes were spread apart like those of a human used to walking barefoot. The foot curved back like a human foot to what appeared to be a human heel. There was a pair of prints in the series that showed a left and right foot. The distance between them is just what you&#039;d expect in modern human footprints.<br>In December 1862, The Geologist carried news of a human skeleton found 27.5 m (90 ft) below the surface in a coal seam in Illinois. The seam was dated between 286 and 320 million years. It&#039;s true that a few eoliths, skull fragments and fossil footprints, however old, provide no real backing for the idea of advanced prehistoric human civilisations.<br>But some other discoveries do.<br>In 1968, an American fossil collector named William J. Meister found a fossilised human shoe print near Antelope Spring, Utah. There were trilobite fossils in the same stone, which means it was at least 245 million years old. Close examination showed that the sole of this shoe differed little, if at all, from those of shoes manufactured today.<br>In 1897, a carved stone showing multiple faces of an old man was found at a depth of 40 m (130 ft) in a coal mine in Iowa.

Frank J. Kenwood, who made the discovery, was so intrigued he traced the origin of the coal and discovered it came from the Wilburton Mine in Oklahoma.

The head was completely encased, ruling out the possibility that it had been driven in at some recent date. The block from which it came is approximately 360 million years old.<br>On 22 June 1844, The Times reported that a length of gold thread had been found by workmen embedded in stone close to the River Tweed. This stone too was around 360 million years old.<br>Astonishing though these dates may appear to anyone familiar with the orthodox theory of human origins, they pale in comparison with the dates of two further discoveries.<br>According to Scientific American, dated 5 June 1852, blasting activities at Meeting House Hill, in Dorchester, Massachusetts, unearthed a metallic, bell-shaped vessel extensively decorated with silver inlays of flowers and vines. The workmanship was described as &#039;exquisite&#039;. The vessel was blown out of a bed of Roxbury conglomerate dated somewhat earlier than 600 million years.<br>In 1993, Michael A. Cremo and Richard L. Thompson reported the discovery &#039;over the past several decades&#039; of hundreds of metallic spheres in a pyrophyllite mine in South Africa. The spheres are grooved and give the appearance of having been manufactured.

There is no indication of them having developed out of any earlier form. They simply appear. What&#039;s more, every major form of plant arrives together. This can only be explained in orthodox evolutionary terms if none of the millions of intermediate stages which led to this dramatic development ever fossilised. The chances against this are ASTRONOMICAL.<br>The first flowering plants also appear in the fossil record fully formed. Although we have an abundance of fossils of the earlier, non-flowering species, not a single one of these can be described as an intermediate form on the evolutionary path to flowers. At one point, there were no flowering plants. At another, flowering plants were all over the place.<br>You find exactly the same bizarre pattern in the animal kingdom.<br>The earliest fish with spines and brains appeared some 450 million years ago. In all the many curious lifeforms discovered in the sea, they had no apparent evolutionary ancestors. According to orthodox doctrine, the cartilaginous skeleton found in the certain fish - like the ray - gradually evolved into a bony skeleton. The fossil record shows cartilaginous fish appeared (without apparent ancestors) 75 million years AFTER bony fish.<br>Orthodox doctrine also insists fish with jaws gradually evolved from jawless varieties. The fossil record shows nothing of that sort. Fish with jaws suddenly appeared, with no discernible ancestry. Furthermore, these jawed fish somehow evolved into one jawless species - the lamprey - despite the fact that jawlessness is supposed to be a characteristic destined to be selected out of the life stream.

Some 320 million years ago, fossils of fully a dozen orders of amphibians began to be laid down. All had well-developed limbs, shoulders and pelvic girdles. None showed the slightest sign of having evolved from fish or even from anything else that evolved from fish.<br>Fish species themselves show no signs of evolution. The shark who terrifies swimmers today is the same beast he was 150 million years ago. Oysters and mussels have been around unchanged for even longer - they appeared in their present form and were arguably just as delicious 400 million years ago.<br>Mammals appeared suddenly as well. The orthodox theory suggests that they evolved from a single, tree-dwelling, shrew-like creature that expanded into the niche left when the dinosaurs perished. There was indeed such a creature, but the fossil record gives no indication whatsoever that it evolved into anything. Instead, 10 million years after the dinosaurs disappeared, a dozen or so separate and distinct mammalian species turn up without warning in the fossil record... in areas as distinct as South America, Africa and Asia. There are no intermediate fossils showing a connection between these mammals and the earlier shrew. There are no fossils showing any inter-species evolution either.

The Ancient Greeks had a cyclical conception of human history that was similar to the cyclical conception of human history that the Hindus had (and STILL have). The Ancient Greeks had a Golden Age (equivalent to Satya Yuga in Hinduism), a Silver Age (equivalent to Treta Yuga in Hinduism), a Bronze Age (equivalent to Dwapara Yuga in Hinduism) and an Iron Age (equivalent to Kali Yuga in Hinduism). I call the model of human history that is currently dominant among historians &#039;the linear-progressive model of human history&#039;. The linear-progressive model of human history basically says that the further back in human history you go, the more primitive that humans, their cultures and their technology becomes. The linear-progressive model of human history embraced by modern historians and modern anthropologists actually has its roots in Judaeo-Christian beliefs, ironically enough. Virtually EVERY pre-Abrahamic culture WORLDWIDE embraced a conception of human history that was CYCLICAL, with civilisations rising and falling one after the other over VAST periods of time and humans being EXTREMELY OLD. Take the Puranas (a collection of ancient Indian writings), for example. The Puranas describe human lineages going back over a BILLION YEARS into the past and we have PHYSICAL EVIDENCE (in the form of fossils and artifacts) that confirms this.","filename":"krishnapepe","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":750,"tn_w":100,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492096819705,"time":1492096819,"md5":"O2VEg9p8Fo2GiUd2HgG8gQ==","fsize":458469,"resto":120915295,"id":"BVDq0gTn","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":120920634,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)11:20:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"Relevant discord<br><br>https:\/\/discord.gg\/Enesc8X<br><br>https:\/\/discord.gg\/Enesc8X<br><br>Join up and share your information, we&#039;re always looking for new info.","time":1492096844,"resto":120915295,"id":"5LCnkn39","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":120920705,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)11:21:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120920166\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120920166<\/a><br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Revol<wbr>t_Against_the_Modern_World<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Evola&#039;s subsequent text Revolt Against the Modern World promoted as valid mythology of an ancient Golden Age.

It\u2019s one of the most thought-provoking videos I\u2019ve seen, and I\u2019ve seen a lot of them.<br><br>I recommend watching the video.

As far fetched as it might sound, the video does provide some evidence to this claim. Fairly convincing evidence, but certainly not absolute proof. The main example used is Devil\u2019s Tower from Wyoming, USA. It\u2019s a flat topped mountain that looks like a giant tree stump.<br><br>It\u2019s of course easy to dismiss this as a co-incidence, but the Russian Youtuber shows pictures of several mountains that resemble tree stumps from around the world, and other mountains that look like trees that have been destroyed in a more brutal manner. I suggest you take a look at the video yourself to make sure whether you agree or not.<br><br>The idea that trees taller than Mount Everest have existed on Earth in ancient times is obviously outrageous, and outrageous claims require outrageous proofs, but the fact is that these odd-looking mountains exist is in itself a valid point of interest. Even if you don\u2019t buy the Russian\u2019s assertion of giant trees, you should not discard the attention he is bringing to these mysterious landmarks.","filename":"giant prehistoric tree","ext":".jpg","w":259,"h":194,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1492098163479,"time":1492098163,"md5":"9bNQFlFGY0ByRea5S4jeYg==","fsize":7634,"resto":120915295,"id":"NyHtFy1s","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120923129,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)11:42:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120922228\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120922228<\/a><br>To my knowledge there&#039;s no consensus, just a long series of connecting bits of evidence like repeating pictograms or matching stoneworking techniques.

Devil\u2019s Tower appears to consist of hexagonal pillars.<br><br>The video shows several other curious hexagonal stone structures from around the world. These are supposedly natural formations. The video points out that such shapes occur in nature, such as in honeycomb and snowflakes. Some turtle shells also have hexagonal patterns. One thing that bothers me though, in regard to the Russian video\u2019s claims is that normal trees don\u2019t seem to have these hexagonal shapes, so why do these curious sites from around the world have them if they are all remnants of the giant trees? The giant trees could naturally have different properties compared to normal trees. The video calls the giant trees silicon trees, but I\u2019m not sure whether it means that the trees were originally made of silicon, or they\u2019ve been turned to silicon by some sort of ancient bio-weapon?<br><br>Even if the hexagonal rock pillars don\u2019t have anything to do with trees, it does not detract from the fact that the existence of the pillars is quite a conundrum. According to modern science they\u2019ve been formed by lava and volcanic activity 50-60 million years ago. I\u2019d like to know how they know that. Was a scientist there then recording the event? Have volcanoes managed to form these even hexagonal shapes in the last few centuries since we\u2019ve had natural philosophers and scientists?

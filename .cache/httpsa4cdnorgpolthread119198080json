The associate professor of preventative medicine at Rush University Medical Center designed a device that fits inside of vending machines and waits 25 seconds before releasing the typical processed snacks. But healthier fare \u2014 like peanuts or popcorn \u2014 drops instantly.<br><br>Think of it as a sort of &quot;time tax.&quot; The idea is that every second you spend waiting for a snack will make you want it less, similar to how a tax on sugary drinks might get you to buy less soda, Appelhans says.<br><br>&quot;We were interested in the ability to test whether time delays can nudge people to healthier choices,&quot; he says.<br><br>So, he created DISC, or &quot;Delays to Influence Snack Choice,&quot; to test the idea. The device is a platform inserted inside a vending machine that catches snacks falling from the top half of the machine, where a vending machine operator would sort all of the unhealthy snacks. On the display window, a written decal tells customers they&#039;ll have to wait for an extra 25 seconds for less-healthy snacks.<br><br>When a snack falls onto DISC, it triggers a 25-second countdown on the vending machine&#039;s display screen. At the end of the countdown, DISC drops its platform and the snack falls into the vending machine&#039;s bay. Healthier snacks are all sorted into the bottom half of the vending machine and so would bypass the platform altogether.<br><br>To qualify as &quot;healthy,&quot; snacks had to meet 5 out of 7 criteria, such as packing fewer than 250 calories, 350 mg of sodium or 10 mg of added sugars per serving, containing no transfats or getting less than 35 percent of their calories from fat. (Some might quibble with that last point.)","filename":"vendingmachine","ext":".jpg","w":900,"h":670,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":186,"tim":1491139097332,"time":1491139097,"md5":"mUvrHOp48ycZidPU+Nhv7A==","fsize":202825,"resto":0,"id":"AhH4JoMC","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"americans-so-fat-our-vending-machines-are","country_name":"United States","replies":60,"images":11,"unique_ips":35},{"no":119198282,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)09:20:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Customers complain<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Customers start buying candy in a gas station<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Vending company out of business<\/span><br><br>This is America sir.

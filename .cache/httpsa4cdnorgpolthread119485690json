Also why did he give a lunatic a loaded weapon? He obviously goofed big time. He&#039;s dead. I know it&#039;s old news but I just saw the movie and it was terrible. Was the lead actor the guy from saved by the bell? My god he was awful.","filename":"IMG_0684","ext":".jpg","w":306,"h":486,"tn_w":157,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491323236365,"time":1491323236,"md5":"UJklrX92auP9iG5xKKrHgA==","fsize":54331,"resto":0,"id":"dThHuJAG","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"ventura-the-hero-kyle-the-cuck","country_name":"United States","replies":4,"images":0,"unique_ips":4},{"no":119486212,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)12:32:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119485690\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119485690<\/a><br>Jesse &quot;The Mouth&quot; Ventura was just a bullshitter.

And don&#039;t give me parallels to Trump, it didn&#039;t apply when Geert Wilders actually underperformed in the past Dutch elections and when Hofer lost the Presidential election in Austria despite him leading in the polls. We&#039;re totally screwed. <br><br>Think about it.<br><br>If the polls turn out to be right, then Le Pen will surely lose. There&#039;s only two weeks until round 2<br><br>Macaroni is not extreme, just a run-of-the-mill bureaucrat and shill, but who will &quot;catch all&quot; the normies and useful idiots who like him because he&#039;s safe, boring centrist. <br><br>Le Pen really has no chance unless (1) the polls are entirely wrong and there is a &quot;hidden&quot; Le Pen vote, (2) there is some scandal with Macaroni or (3) something extreme happens, like another terrorist attack.<br><br>Ideally, it should have been Melenchon verus Le Pen which would have given Le Pen a victory because the centrists and Fillon cucks would&#039;ve voted for her esp. over a communist. When you have a centrist versus a radical, in this boring day and age where people can&#039;t be inspired to step outside of their comfort zone, the centrist always wins.<br><br>The reason I think it is important to have this discussion is because there seems to be a lot of Americans on this board who are just saying &quot;REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED WITH TRUMP&quot; but that&#039;s a really damaging way to look at this. Trump won with a sliver of a margin and even then, there was evidence of a &quot;secret Trump vote.&quot; The same rules do not apply to France and if this board gets tunnel vision like that, we&#039;ll have a hard reality check two weeks from now. This election is arguably the most important election in Europe.","filename":"o shit","ext":".jpg","w":768,"h":768,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492972859078,"time":1492972859,"md5":"kM9omfgmMBFTtN0abeTF\/A==","fsize":213759,"resto":0,"id":"M\/ZBA8D7","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"french-election-discussion-1","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":1},{"no":122463879,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)14:42:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"If Le Pen or any serious right-wing candidate could win at ANY point in France, it would be now. The other candidates are utterly embarrassing and both of the major parties are widely disliked, not to mention Hollande&#039;s approval rating is literally 4%. If Macaroni wins in France, the momentum is effectively over. Any hopes of Europe changing are over and the EU will continue to exist, and the decline will persist, and the West will ultimately just be a footnote in history. Try to think about this all with sober senses.","time":1492972928,"resto":122463711,"id":"M\/ZBA8D7","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

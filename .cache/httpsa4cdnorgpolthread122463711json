And don&#039;t give me parallels to Trump, it didn&#039;t apply when Geert Wilders actually underperformed in the past Dutch elections and when Hofer lost the Presidential election in Austria despite him leading in the polls. We&#039;re totally screwed. <br><br>Think about it.<br><br>If the polls turn out to be right, then Le Pen will surely lose. There&#039;s only two weeks until round 2<br><br>Macaroni is not extreme, just a run-of-the-mill bureaucrat and shill, but who will &quot;catch all&quot; the normies and useful idiots who like him because he&#039;s safe, boring centrist. <br><br>Le Pen really has no chance unless (1) the polls are entirely wrong and there is a &quot;hidden&quot; Le Pen vote, (2) there is some scandal with Macaroni or (3) something extreme happens, like another terrorist attack.<br><br>Ideally, it should have been Melenchon verus Le Pen which would have given Le Pen a victory because the centrists and Fillon cucks would&#039;ve voted for her esp. over a communist. When you have a centrist versus a radical, in this boring day and age where people can&#039;t be inspired to step outside of their comfort zone, the centrist always wins.<br><br>The reason I think it is important to have this discussion is because there seems to be a lot of Americans on this board who are just saying &quot;REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED WITH TRUMP&quot; but that&#039;s a really damaging way to look at this. Trump won with a sliver of a margin and even then, there was evidence of a &quot;secret Trump vote.&quot; The same rules do not apply to France and if this board gets tunnel vision like that, we&#039;ll have a hard reality check two weeks from now.

Intentionally splitting up large sums of cash into sub-$10,000 amounts to avoid that reporting requirement is known as \u201cstructuring\u201d and is illegal under the federal Bank Secrecy Act.<br><br>But many business owners engaged in perfectly legal activities may be unaware of the law. Others are covered by insurance policies that don&#039;t cover cash losses greater than $10,000. Still others simply want to avoid extra paperwork, and keep their deposits less than $10,000 on the advice of bank employees or colleagues.<br><br>While structuring is technically a crime, it&#039;s something of a secondary one. The reporting requirements were enacted to detect serious criminal activity, such as drug dealing and terrorism. They \u201cwere not put in place just so that the Government could enforce the reporting requirements,\u201d as the IG&#039;s report puts it.<br><br>The IG took a random sample of 278 IRS forfeiture actions in cases where structuring was the primary basis for seizure. The report found that in 91 percent of those cases, the individuals and business had obtained their money legally.<br><br>\u201cMost people impacted by the program did not appear to be criminal enterprises engaged in other alleged illegal activity,\u201d according to a news release from the IG. \u201cRather, they were legal businesses such as jewelry stores, restaurant owners, gas station owners, scrap metal dealers, and others.\u201d","filename":"IRS","ext":".jpg","w":443,"h":361,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":203,"tim":1491544335439,"time":1491544335,"md5":"5fliq3B9kE5FpDO6B69B0g==","fsize":31767,"resto":0,"id":"J92T1ERK","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"irs-took-millions-from-innocents","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

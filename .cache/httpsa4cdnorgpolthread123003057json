The documents, part of an internal budget proposal for 2018, seem to confirm the State Department and USAID\u2019s 28 percent budget cut announced in March. While many countries will suffer from major cutbacks or else have aid cancelled entirely, funds to the West Bank and the Gaza Strip will see an increase of 4.6 percent for the 2018 fiscal year, from $205 million in 2017 to $215 million. Increased aid will be funneled to Syria, Iraq and Libya to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars, while other countries in the Middle East will be subjected to cutbacks, according to the report.<\/span>","filename":"trump-laughing","ext":".jpg","w":720,"h":291,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":101,"tim":1493272986600,"time":1493272986,"md5":"Mq6ktzMNW9zYjRZflu+aog==","fsize":38563,"resto":0,"id":"4ZtGtCwv","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"oh-im-sorry-but-did-someone-accuse-me-mr-trump-of","country_name":"United States","replies":3,"images":0,"unique_ips":4},{"no":123003373,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)02:06:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123003057\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123003057<\/a><br>I accused Trump. 9768 us liquid gallons of jewish cum consumed in first 100 days.","time":1493273205,"resto":123003057,"id":"C2LVOGcr","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123004825,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)02:25:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"We should close most of our embassies in 3rd world countries.","time":1493274321,"resto":123003057,"id":"LRM1xot7","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123006294,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)02:43:10","com":"<a href=\"#p123003057\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123003057<\/a><br>SWEET!","time":1493275390,"resto":123003057,"id":"dB7\/9NWa","country":"US","trip":"!niqjediPCA","country_name":"United States"}]}

I can do either or both.<br><br>To understand the difference between Keynes&#039; theories and other monetarists, you need to understand that currency models the greater economy in the sense that it is a representation of goods and services. Thus, in order to be an accurate representation and of useful value, the entirety of the money supply should correspond to the entirety of the value of goods and services within the economy. Friedman and other monetarists suggested conforming the interest rates to the rate of growth in the economy under the recognition that economics is not zero-sum. Keynes suggested adjusting the interest rates to influence the economy; it&#039;s obvious that adjusting the model doesn&#039;t affect the real phenomena and you get hyperinflation, deflationary spirals, etc., as a result because currency is only backed by faith in its value and once faith is lost it is not useful as a medium of exchange.<br><br>Or, Keynes was a faggot kike and probably also a product of a nigger in the woodpile. Everything he said was lisping ape gibber bullshit.

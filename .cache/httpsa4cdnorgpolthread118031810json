Is there really no more love for true and authentic shitposting out there? It&#039;s really become &quot;lol ur wrong xD&quot; as a form of trolling? Psshh. I remember back in my early days on the chans I would whip up a throwaway tripcode and start avatarfagging on levels faggots like you can only dream. I had gigabytes of various reaction images from generic weeb anime #2849 to trigger fans of generic weeb anime #2848 into oblivion. And this was for a random Tuesday. Nothing even special. Yet here you are snickering to yourself in a dark room, wiping away tears from your eyes, thinking you&#039;re the hottest shit that&#039;s totally untouchable, but what&#039;s this? You just wiped spicy cheeto dust in your eyes. That&#039;s the 7th time this week. I&#039;m over here. Evolved. Shitposting from my phone, doxxing myself so fags like you can waddle their fat ass on my property for me to legally murder. &quot;oh no an intruder&quot; *shotguns*. And that&#039;s pretty much the whole point of this. You&#039;re a fucking loser and an awful troll. I&#039;ve been trolling on bitches like you since I was 12. And here you are. Probably 30+. Kissless virgin. Getting angry at people on the Internet.

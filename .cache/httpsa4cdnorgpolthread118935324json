This is why we buy bananas predominantly from the equatorial regions of Central America, the cost of the distance they have to travel is more than recovered by the ability to pack more straight bananas into a container. We can still buy bananas from Mexico, even though they aren&#039;t as efficiently transported, because they don&#039;t have to travel as far. They can even be trucked in to distribution centers. You won&#039;t have this benefit shipping to Europe, your curved bananas still have to be put on a ship. <br><br>Of course this is about more than your curved bananas. This is about everything you trade with the US, your number 1 trade partner. The tariff is going to be bad for your economy. It&#039;s going to be bad for ours too, but we can survive it. I&#039;m not sure you can.","time":1490894973,"resto":118935324,"id":"p0RnTuKG","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

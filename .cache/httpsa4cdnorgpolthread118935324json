A 20% tax on mexican goods would fucking crush them until they payed for the wall. Americans would still buy some stuff, but the majority of it would be priced so as to keep selling to America, which means that they would be eating the cost, and a ton of companies simply wouldn&#039;t be able to accomidate for the new tax and would just go out of business. Americans would only see a moderate increase in cost, but who cares, the mexicans would eat the majority of the cost, and their economy gets wrecked if they dont.","time":1490896628,"resto":118935324,"id":"8mxKQnJk","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118946492,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)13:57:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118946389\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118946389<\/a><br>ur missing the big picture<br><a href=\"#p118943652\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118943652<\/a>","time":1490896673,"resto":118935324,"id":"W6aRjtSt","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118946773,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)14:00:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118946272\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118946272<\/a><br>I was waiting for someone to point this out.","time":1490896828,"resto":118935324,"id":"Kdv9LIFw","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118949383,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)14:24:55","name":"Anonymous","filename":"1490890289829","ext":".jpg","w":666,"h":1582,"tn_w":52,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490898295004,"time":1490898295,"md5":"7XNcQ0BRmXRaEniHxu8QbA==","fsize":289034,"resto":118935324,"id":"E0htZnGM","country":"IE","m_img":1,"country_name":"Ireland"},{"no":118949529,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)14:26:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118949383\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118949383<\/a><br>see <br><a href=\"#p118943652\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118943652<\/a><br>can this meme stop please<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;1.

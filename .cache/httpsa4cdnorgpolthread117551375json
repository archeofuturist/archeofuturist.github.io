You live with your mother. You are a fat fuck up, she\u2019s probably so sick of you already. So sick of having to do everything for you all goddamn day, every day, for a grown man who spends all his time on 4chan posting about the same tired meme. Just imagine this. She had you, and then she thought you were gonna be a scientist or an astronaut or something grand, and then you became a SHILL. A pathetic ShareBlue SHILL. She probably cries herself to sleep everyday thinking about how bad it is and how she wishes she could just disappear. She can\u2019t even try to talk with you because all you say is \u201cDRUMPF BTFO DRUMPF BTFO.\u201d You\u2019ve become a parody of your own self. And that\u2019s all you are.

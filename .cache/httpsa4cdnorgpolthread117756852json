Who knows, maybe a few honest left wing libertarians will rise amongst the labor party.. increased community policing and legal weed! Then again, they&#039;d probably want to decentralise making our already ridiculous local councils even more ridiculous, but hey, left wing libertarianism is all about the community replacing authority.<br><br><a href=\"#p117758260\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117758260<\/a><br>None that are worth it.<br><br>If you&#039;re into nationalism, your most intelligent vote is one of the liberal national parties. They&#039;re actually not exactly the liberal party but at the same time they&#039;re about as effective as the liberal party. Nationalistic libertarianism is a tricky political position because you probably agree with their policies up to a point and then it&#039;s just legislated morality. I&#039;d sooner be flooded with migrants and buy weed at a consistent price\/weight, I&#039;ve never quite understood why I can&#039;t have both.<br><br>I don&#039;t trust Pauline Hanson. She&#039;s a cosmopolitan left wing at the Italian club and a goosestepping nationalist amongst men under 30. Two faced as fuck.

Screencap this. He&#039;s lost his base, and now he&#039;s trying to push Bannon out. He&#039;s not the same Trump he was just a few weeks ago. Whether this was his intention all along or not, he fucked up.<br><br>One of the big things said about Trump during the election was that he had to live up to his promises, that not fulfilling them would ensure he&#039;d never get reelected. Now I&#039;m questioning if he&#039;ll actually go through with the wall, or if we&#039;ll get some bullshit about needing the funds for a war. <br><br>Who was it, the NYT who were supposedly told by Trump off the record that he would soften his stance on immigration after he got elected? I remember Cruz using that to attack him, but maybe it was actually true. Trump is a sellout. Whether its because of the people around him influencing him or whatever, he betrayed his core voters. It&#039;ll be interesting to see how he handles it tomorrow, but the fact that the media is lavishing praise on him, after blatantly lying about him for over a year straight pretty much confirms he&#039;s compromised.","filename":"1486624462082","ext":".jpg","w":225,"h":225,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491553919547,"time":1491553919,"md5":"bO1q5P5ZRpk8Q9LYt2ZUCA==","fsize":17569,"resto":119913206,"id":"vrEsalpM","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119914586,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)04:35:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119914269\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119914269<\/a><br><a href=\"#p119914159\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119914159<\/a>","filename":"12343123124","ext":".png","w":582,"h":172,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":36,"tim":1491554103740,"time":1491554103,"md5":"xooWg1nXV+rLYZQycAm5VA==","fsize":47093,"resto":119913206,"id":"UvtNkvgB","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119914789,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)04:36:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119914586\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119914586<\/a><br>I&#039;m confused by her tweet.

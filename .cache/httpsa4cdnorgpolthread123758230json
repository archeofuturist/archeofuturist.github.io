The tradition of the (Jewish) elders, together with other human tradition, is rejected.7 At the same time there is good apostolic tradition which is simply the Christian faith as it was proclaimed and transmitted by the apostles and their associates.8 The New Testament writings sprang out of this latter tradition at different stages in its history. There is therefore an important sense in which (apostolic) tradition precedes Scripture, an aspect largely ignored by traditional Protestant theology. But although this has important implications for the origin of the New Testament it does not foreclose the question of the subsequent relation between Scripture and tradition. The New Testament may derive from the original apostolic tradition but once it was produced it became distinct from that tradition and the relation between the two became an open question. It also became a question which could not long be ignored for the original apostolic tradition did not suddenly die when the New Testament was produced but remained as the context in which it was read and interpreted.","time":1493727005,"resto":123758230,"id":"WTotSxE9","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123761023,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)08:13:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123760751\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123760751<\/a><br>I believe that just like accepting Christ into your life you recieve the seal of the Lord, stating the Islamic decree &quot;There is no other god but ___llah<br>and muhammad is his prophet&quot; gives you the mark of the beast.

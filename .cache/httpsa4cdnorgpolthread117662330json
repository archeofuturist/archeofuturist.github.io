Oh look at that, the district judge just stepped out of bounds by the limits set by the ninth circuit&#039;s ruling, just like the Washington judge did. Are you a fucking drunk? Are you retarded? Are you autistic? You are a fucking idiot and you should never make a topic on this board again and I&#039;m fucking serious. I almost have a feeling you&#039;re the only guy making all these anti-Trump topics because you&#039;re a faggot hater who doesn&#039;t like the guy because he&#039;s good. Fuck you, be good at something in YOUR life and then maybe try to troll the President of America on the board, like I give a fuck. It&#039;s so easy to spot out your threads now, you&#039;re a retard. Always doing stupid shit like this. Why don&#039;t you try to be a good poster? Just for once? For once in your fucking life try not to make a topic like this. That&#039;s just you, you&#039;re always right at getting it wrong. Fuck you. You are nothing.","time":1490127829,"resto":117662330,"id":"CP+bH+Fh","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":117665502,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)16:23:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117665380\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117665380<\/a><br>That&#039;s not true, Tom Price crafted the current bill. <br><br>That is the Trump administration.","time":1490127837,"resto":117662330,"id":"E9Wffnnl","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117665534,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)16:24:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117665405\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117665405<\/a><br>is that a T-Rex??","time":1490127853,"resto":117662330,"id":"xBh8CJuq","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117665550,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)16:24:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117665230\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117665230<\/a><br>Spain BTFO the commies though.

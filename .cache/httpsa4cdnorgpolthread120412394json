I hate my job, my wife of 5 years is a stranger and I&#039;m pretty sure she&#039;s cheating on me. I&#039;m looking for a drastic change in life, and I don&#039;t want to outright leave my wife unless I catch her dead to rights cheating on me. I figure the time in basic and whatever deployment will give me new experiences and kinda put my home life in perspective. I&#039;m not terribly out of shape, I surf and I hike quite often, so I&#039;m not worried about the physical aspect. I just don&#039;t want to be seen as running away, my family has a history of serving, and I feel like I&#039;m missing a huge chunk of my life by not having served yet. I heard y&#039;all are the place to post shit like this so I just wanted to get that off my chest and maybe a perspective or two I hadn&#039;t considered yet. Thanks in advance.","filename":"1E1CE0DC-DBDD-483E-9D67-C0E332C80253-1554-0000016D3604B3F6","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":578,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":240,"tim":1491811965178,"time":1491811965,"md5":"f1O7PldLmiQjUu\/JmyqGVQ==","fsize":49808,"resto":0,"id":"BfBf9Yt+","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"i-think-im-going-to-join-the-army-my-life-is","country_name":"United States","replies":36,"images":2,"unique_ips":13},{"no":120412989,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)04:19:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"posts nudes of the wife so if you die in glorious battle you will have at least saved an anon&#039;s sexual frustrations","time":1491812395,"resto":120412394,"id":"xih0gDQk","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120413093,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)04:21:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120412989\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120412989<\/a><br>Tell you what, if I get shipped off to N Korea after enlisting, I will most certainly post them for you.","time":1491812462,"resto":120412394,"id":"BfBf9Yt+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120413654,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)04:28:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120412394\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120412394<\/a><br><br>lol the army will hate you<br><br>people who join because &#039;my life sucked&#039; get washed out, soldiers are largely people who are passionate about service, especially in basic and for the first few years. they&#039;ll smell the loser on you, anon, and hate you for it","time":1491812888,"resto":120412394,"id":"\/oc8rddf","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120414437,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)04:37:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120413654\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120413654<\/a><br>I think you misunderstand my perspective.

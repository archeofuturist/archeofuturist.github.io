The type I use is high pressure air line about 3\/4&quot; in diameter, about twice the length of my forearm. The reason for this length is that it is generally the best length for concealability, speed, and power. It won&#039;t break bone or even cause permanent damage on most areas of the body, but it can cause some seriously excruciating pain with even a light hit. A quick strike across the face will hurt so bad that only someone jacked up on drugs could take it and keep coming. A rubber hose cannot be considered a deadly weapon by any stretch of the imagination, and a piece can be folded inside a roomy jacket pocket, down inside a purse, or stuck down in a boot.","time":1492839994,"resto":122240659,"id":"Hc\/\/8U4u","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122243122,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)01:52:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122240659\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122240659<\/a><br>Intercept bus&#039;es before riot day is the only logistics you need to worry about. 1960s style","time":1492840351,"resto":122240659,"id":"AC41EypT","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122243236,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)01:53:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122242621\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122242621<\/a><br>No squirt guns or gun-shaped items desu.

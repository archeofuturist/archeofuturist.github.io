Alt-light? Did you coin the term yourself? I would certainly define Fillon as a cuck, maybe a frustrated one but a cuck who has proved he can perfectly deal with frustration when he worked under Sarkozy for 5 years. I don&#039;t expect anything from Fillon but obviously I would vote for him should he face Macron in the second round.","time":1490548704,"resto":118383051,"id":"Az+JDd6\/","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":118386250,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)13:23:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;so now we know that Macron&#039;s poll (centrist) are rigged and that Fillon (alt-light) is going ahead of him<\/span><br><br>Also, did I miss something in the news today?","time":1490549024,"resto":118383051,"id":"Az+JDd6\/","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":118386619,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)13:26:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118385577\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118385577<\/a><br>Salut ici,<br>Non le terme alt-light ne vient pas de moi mais des alt-righters qui parlent de Molyneux, Prisonplanet et cie.

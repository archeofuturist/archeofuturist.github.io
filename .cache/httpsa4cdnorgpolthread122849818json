I am posting here against the advice of basically everyone I know. My career is ruined, I have fled my state, and I am honestly frightened. <br><br>I know that I will find no sympathy on this board and I really don&#039;t deserve any. I am ashamed of my actions. I hurt another human, Sean, and I am really experiencing sorrow for my actions. That wasn&#039;t my only shameful moment as this wasn&#039;t my first experience with stealth injury infliction. <br><br>The exposure of my actions have made me aware of exactly how abhorrent they were. I guess I had always compartmentalized what I&#039;ve done as well as justify those actions. I realize now just how despicable I have become. I am guilty of hurting humans just because I feel they have an incorrect ideology.<br><br>I now know that I am a caricature of what it is I truly believe, and I will express this in court. I am prepared to take full accountability for my actions, and know that I deserve jail time. This brings me to why I decided to post here.<br><br>Please leave my family alone! I know that I deserve everything that is happening to me, but my innocent family does not. I hope that you all can direct your vitriol against me into compassion for my victim, Sean Stiles.<br><br>Thanks for any consideration... Eric.","time":1493185984,"resto":122849818,"id":"pPDNi6Ue","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122851077,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)01:56:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122850790\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122850790<\/a><br>I know this is likely fake, but, whether it&#039;s real or it&#039;s a fake, my advice to the poster remains unchanged:<br><br>Take what you have learned and use it to better yourself.

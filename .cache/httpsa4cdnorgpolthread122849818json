I guess I had always compartmentalized what I&#039;ve done as well as justify those actions. I realize now just how despicable I have become. I am guilty of hurting humans just because I feel they have an incorrect ideology.<br><br>I now know that I am a caricature of what it is I truly believe, and I will express this in court. I am prepared to take full accountability for my actions, and know that I deserve jail time. This brings me to why I decided to post here.<br><br>Please leave my family alone! I know that I deserve everything that is happening to me, but my innocent family does not.

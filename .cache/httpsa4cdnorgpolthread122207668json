From the flubs Trump is making and his advanced age there is a good chance he may be going senile too. He forgets what world leaders have died, isn&#039;t clear on details of where the naval armada is, forgets to actually sign an executive order, has difficulty reading, and mistakes what country he just bombed. The elementary school level vocabulary may also be due being unable to recall other words and inventing new ones such as bigly. Add all that with the fact that his father had Alzheimer&#039;s and I think we have a huge cause for concern. Someone in congress needs to introduce a bill requiring the President to undergo an annual psychiatric evaluation. Then go full on media blitz like the birthers did for the Obama birth certificate.

So yes bigly is a word just one that isn&#039;t used because it&#039;s unnecessary and sounds dumb. I was wrong and should have taken the two seconds to look it up, but it is a moot point because as I wrote in my first edit I was corrected and he was actually slurring together big league. Basically I was wrong twice but I only want to take the blame for one and a half.

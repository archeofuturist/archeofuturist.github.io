However, as it stands, race is more than merely skin-deep. There are clear and defined differences beyond that simply of skin colour, as someone has previously said. An Australian Aboriginal has defining physical characteristics which differ from the characteristics of a West African or a Tamil (South Indian). Though they share skin colour in this scenario, the three different peoples have many discernable differences in physical characteristics. The West African on average has a larger amount percentage wise of fast twitch muscle fiber than the Tamil or the Aborigine. The Tamil on average has a slightly larger cranial capacity and greater number of neurons than the West African or Aborigine. The Aborigine on average has a higher amount of slow twitch muscle fiber than either the West African or the Tamil. Though they all share skin colour, this simple showing of differing average physical characteristics shows that though their skin is the same, they are different, at least slightly, on average. Now, compare a Scandinavian to the Aborigine or any of these three groups, and differences will crop up there as well; the skin colour is simply the most noticeable difference, but even if every group shared the same skin colour, they would not share the same averages in regards to their physical characteristics.","time":1493398825,"resto":123212047,"id":"XCvJxgPd","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123216156,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)13:02:32","name":"Sage","com":"<a href=\"#p123212047\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123212047<\/a><br>You gotta take that word average out of your vocabulary","time":1493398952,"resto":123212047,"id":"yN0RdwFa","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123216527,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)13:05:58","name":"Student of Life","com":"<a href=\"#p123214564\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123214564<\/a><br>Thank you.

So people of different colors have slightly or drastically different genetics. So now look at places with high concentrations of similar genetics. Take sub Sahara Africa for instance, what have those people with those genetics done? What&#039;s the state of those people and there societies? Now do the same with western Europe. You can see the difference plain as day right? The natural progression of these people&#039;s with varying genetics no matter how small caused massive differences in the way they perceive the world and how to live in it. There can be an argument on environment but the people&#039;s genetics evolved to match it. Meaning Europeans might of lucked out in environment and we&#039;re more likely to develop more socially rather than based on survival.

I understand you&#039;re likely here either due to some stupid school project, or some vague notion of superiority, coming amongst us like a missionary would go amongst the noble savages of old, but as you would have likely preferred the missionary of old to respect the cultural norms of the people he went to, we kindly ask that you respect our norms as well. <br><br>Additionally, the anti-Semitism is unavoidable here. It&#039;s regrettably also a piece of the culture here, and so you must either grow used to it, or try to stomp it out. However, if you try to stomp it out it makes you little better than the colonial imperialists who tried to stomp out norms they had viewed as &#039;wrong&#039; or &#039;backwards&#039; such as exposure of unwanted children and things like that.","time":1493399507,"resto":123212047,"id":"XCvJxgPd","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123217817,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)13:17:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123216527\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123216527<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;racial identity is irrelevant<\/span><br>What are you a fucking kike nigger faggot?!<br>I had to deal with subhuman gypsys most of my life and i had yet to meet one that does not either live by commiting crimes or living off of society like a leach.<br>They are literal subhuman tier beings and niggers are pretty much the same,go visit a nigger getto and if you get out alive you will be redpill for life.<br>Also sociology....oh another useless piece of shit that will end up working at mcdonalds.","filename":"1493362426676m","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":1024,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493399853514,"time":1493399853,"md5":"C\/2H9FtuMGnJZN9Y\/oCFbA==","fsize":117944,"resto":123212047,"id":"JLDDS33S","country":"RO","country_name":"Romania"},{"no":123218527,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)13:23:36","name":"Ur Mom","com":"What would happen if we raised a black person like a white person, and what prevents black people from inheriting genes that makes them more intelligent?","filename":"IMG_3188","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":624,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":121,"tim":1493400216639,"time":1493400216,"md5":"sS4JjZIGCZri4F0uEtxZ+A==","fsize":73293,"resto":123212047,"id":"vT+DMABR","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123219733,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)13:34:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123216527\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123216527<\/a><br>Another note on how 4chan works.

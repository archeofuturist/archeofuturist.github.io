However, as it stands, race is more than merely skin-deep. There are clear and defined differences beyond that simply of skin colour, as someone has previously said. An Australian Aboriginal has defining physical characteristics which differ from the characteristics of a West African or a Tamil (South Indian). Though they share skin colour in this scenario, the three different peoples have many discernable differences in physical characteristics. The West African on average has a larger amount percentage wise of fast twitch muscle fiber than the Tamil or the Aborigine. The Tamil on average has a slightly larger cranial capacity and greater number of neurons than the West African or Aborigine. The Aborigine on average has a higher amount of slow twitch muscle fiber than either the West African or the Tamil. Though they all share skin colour, this simple showing of differing average physical characteristics shows that though their skin is the same, they are different, at least slightly, on average. Now, compare a Scandinavian to the Aborigine or any of these three groups, and differences will crop up there as well; the skin colour is simply the most noticeable difference, but even if every group shared the same skin colour, they would not share the same averages in regards to their physical characteristics.","time":1493398825,"resto":123212047,"id":"XCvJxgPd","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123216156,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)13:02:32","name":"Sage","com":"<a href=\"#p123212047\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123212047<\/a><br>You gotta take that word average out of your vocabulary","time":1493398952,"resto":123212047,"id":"yN0RdwFa","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123216527,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)13:05:58","name":"Student of Life","com":"<a href=\"#p123214564\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123214564<\/a><br>Thank you.

So people of different colors have slightly or drastically different genetics. So now look at places with high concentrations of similar genetics. Take sub Sahara Africa for instance, what have those people with those genetics done? What&#039;s the state of those people and there societies? Now do the same with western Europe. You can see the difference plain as day right? The natural progression of these people&#039;s with varying genetics no matter how small caused massive differences in the way they perceive the world and how to live in it. There can be an argument on environment but the people&#039;s genetics evolved to match it. Meaning Europeans might of lucked out in environment and we&#039;re more likely to develop more socially rather than based on survival.

The principe of usury, since essentially the beginning of recorded history, is a Jewish practice that arises out of a paradigm that allows Jews to act and behave as if they are &quot;the chosen,&quot; and allowed the Jews to steal using this principle. This principle is the driving force behind the world&#039;s central banks and the current power structure. The slave trade, which started in the 15th Century, originated when the Portuguese kid napped Africans and brought them to Europe etc. Later, the Sephardic Jews came to the US colonies, and were an integral part of the slave trade despite having names like &quot;Nunez&quot; etc. the principle of globalization and the tainting of cultural bloodlines was and still is a goal of the then Zionist, and now globalist Jews. <br><br>This same impetus has been present throughout history, which is why Jews have been cast out of 100+ societies, wherever they ended up, until they gained control of the monetary system. Because these people only view their culture as good, they&#039;ve essentially enslaved the world and all of its unique cultures using money. By destroying all other cultures and races using globalism and Talmudic teachings, they will lock their place on Earth as the hegemonic leaders of the world by maintaining their own race. <br><br>Historically speaking, globalism is a relatively new principle, where as before, societies valued their heritage and secured their lands to maintain their values. America&#039;s melting pot meme came to prominence by a Jewish propaganda stint in 1908, and was contrary to the values of America which were set fourth by the 1875 Page Act. This act was, in essence, an act set fourth of disallow &quot;undesirable&quot; immigrants into the country to maintain peace and maintain American culture.","time":1493401520,"resto":123212047,"id":"Z2BuMI+q","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123220890,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)13:45:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123212047\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123212047<\/a><br>if you REALLY want to study sociology, study history.

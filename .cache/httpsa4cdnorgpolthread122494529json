The type I use is high pressure air line about 3\/4&quot; in diameter, about 3 or 4 feet long. The reason for this length is that it is generally the best length for concealability, speed, and power. It won&#039;t break bone or even cause permanent damage on most areas of the body, but it can cause some seriously excruciating pain with even a light hit. A quick strike across the face will hurt so bad that only someone jacked up on drugs could take it and keep coming.

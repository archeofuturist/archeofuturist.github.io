When the Kyoto Board of Education asked middle school English teachers to take the TOEIC, fewer than one in four teachers reached the threshold for language skills good enough for most social demands and limited work requirements.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;There are also questions about the way English is taught in schools. The focus tends to be on grammar, vocabulary and writing, which are repeatedly tested in high-pressure exams.<\/span><br>As a result, English is rarely spoken in Japanese classrooms. Junnosuke Nakamura, who leads the education company EF in Japan, has said that &quot;too often in our schools, a Japanese national is teaching English in Japanese, and English must be taught in English&quot;.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;There is also a barrier from a culture of perfectionism in Japanese education, with a belief that there is a &quot;right&quot; way to do something. Students do not want to make mistakes and they will not attempt something until they are sure they can get it right. This might be a good thing for literacy and numeracy - Japan comes consistently near the top of global rankings such as PISA. But it does not work so well for languages, for which speaking and making mistakes are crucial to learning.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Fumiko Inoue, who lectures in Japanese language and cross-cultural management at Rotterdam Business School, pointed to the experience of one of her Dutch students who taught English in a school in Tokyo. At first, the new teacher was surprised that students were reluctant to speak English in class, but after a lot of encouragement she got them to chat to each other in the language. That is, until she was observed by a senior teacher who criticised her students for making too many grammatical mistakes.<\/span>","filename":"1491259560070","ext":".png","w":500,"h":400,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":100,"tim":1493020228455,"time":1493020228,"md5":"iN9RHLB\/\/\/+BDc94faQ8Zg==","fsize":96158,"resto":122540013,"id":"J5gyndtW","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":122560502,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)03:52:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122551198\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122551198<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;expected kinky nazi-asian porn<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;reverse search image<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; its just from some shitty Hong Kong fasion show<\/span><br><br>why live","filename":"pobrane","ext":".jpg","w":198,"h":255,"tn_w":97,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493020378748,"time":1493020378,"md5":"O+9mGW2\/60ldR3+WN3+D6g==","fsize":9079,"resto":122540013,"id":"QNUMKUlT","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":122560536,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)03:53:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122559851\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122559851<\/a><br><br>Yeah I wonder why.

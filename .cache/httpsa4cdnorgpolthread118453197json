The biggest threat just after birth to babies in the modern age is SIDS due to suffocation. A lot of mothers think its natural to cosleep so the baby can feed as necessary, this is fine except mothers just out of pregnancy are a lot more tired than normal (obviously) and may suffocate the child due to sleeping too deeply.<br><br>At this age a baby had trouble turning its head and is unable to lift head, so if it is in a position where it cannot breath it just dies. In addition beds are often not permeable enough and a rolled over baby can suffocate.<br><br>Another common problem is cribs with &quot;bumpers&quot; or a soft cloth to keep the baby from hurting itself. Not only is this completely unnecessary because the baby can&#039;t move, but if it somehow does it can suffocate. <br><br>I presume baby boxes are mostly inner city for blacks and city whites who are unable to be not retarded and follow basic instruction. <br><br>Tldr babies a shit can&#039;t not suffocate.","time":1490579627,"resto":118453197,"id":"+1xUyhBL","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118454420,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)21:54:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118453197\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118453197<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;his parents never put him in a box<\/span><br>lmao, literally a richfag","time":1490579671,"resto":118453197,"id":"V+9zjgVG","country":"MX","country_name":"Mexico"},{"no":118454487,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)21:55:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"It&#039;s a good idea, no different than when you have young pups.

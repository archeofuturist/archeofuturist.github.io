The biggest threat just after birth to babies in the modern age is SIDS due to suffocation. A lot of mothers think its natural to cosleep so the baby can feed as necessary, this is fine except mothers just out of pregnancy are a lot more tired than normal (obviously) and may suffocate the child due to sleeping too deeply.<br><br>At this age a baby had trouble turning its head and is unable to lift head, so if it is in a position where it cannot breath it just dies. In addition beds are often not permeable enough and a rolled over baby can suffocate.<br><br>Another common problem is cribs with &quot;bumpers&quot; or a soft cloth to keep the baby from hurting itself. Not only is this completely unnecessary because the baby can&#039;t move, but if it somehow does it can suffocate. <br><br>I presume baby boxes are mostly inner city for blacks and city whites who are unable to be not retarded and follow basic instruction. <br><br>Tldr babies a shit can&#039;t not suffocate.","time":1490579627,"resto":118453197,"id":"+1xUyhBL","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118454420,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)21:54:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118453197\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118453197<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;his parents never put him in a box<\/span><br>lmao, literally a richfag","time":1490579671,"resto":118453197,"id":"V+9zjgVG","country":"MX","country_name":"Mexico"},{"no":118454487,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)21:55:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"It&#039;s a good idea, no different than when you have young pups.

My wife was working the day before delivery and went back to work after a two month break. We kept them in cribs in our room until a year to make sure we got past the SIDS window. <br><br>We had it easy because my work was lax. As long as there is a dad in the picture its not an issue. I do kind of feel bad for the single mothers - but between WIC and other benefits they can receive getting by isn&#039;t too hard.","time":1490580429,"resto":118453197,"id":"+1xUyhBL","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118456160,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)22:09:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;be Mexican<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Have baby in US<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Can stay in US now legally<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Hospital gives me convinient box which I can use when I dump this baby in front of my local Catholic church<\/span><br><br>http:\/\/www.dailymail.co.uk\/news\/art<wbr>icle-3345802\/I-knew-left-God-s-hand<wbr>s-OK-Mother-baby-boy-manger-inside-<wbr>New-York-church-opens-abandoned-son<wbr>.html","time":1490580568,"resto":118453197,"id":"L4ugRPOI","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118456261,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)22:10:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118454978\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118454978<\/a><br>kek","time":1490580613,"resto":118453197,"id":"\/DLiLqMn","country":"AT","country_name":"Austria"},{"no":118456534,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)22:12:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118455863\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118455863<\/a><br><br>Dunno its possible.

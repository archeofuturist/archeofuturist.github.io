It is not a bunker buster which is what would be required to effectively knock out a runway. Bunker buster bombs like the Durandal the US actually uses to take out a runway\/bunker are designed to be dropped from a jet or bomber close to the runway\/bunker and it fires a short burn rocket to bury the bomb under the runway\/bunker before exploding. You can&#039;t fire these from a ship deck. There are literally no bunker buster missiles. The reason they work better against a runway than a missile would is because since they detonate under the ground they cause a seismic shockwave as well as the crater the explosion leaves which causes the concrete runway to buckle for tens of meters away from the detonation. There isn&#039;t just a crater there is uneven and broken concrete all around the crater that has to be removed before the runway can be repaired. Even with these bombs runways are often back in service in less than a month as opposed to a few hours with conventional bombs. Yes a month seems like a long time but in the context of military assets it really isn&#039;t long at all. This is why the military usually attacks assets more often than the runways themselves. The assets take far longer to replace than the runway.","time":1491686877,"resto":120168112,"id":"2VjY4yb\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120185311,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)17:28:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120168809\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120168809<\/a><br>Fucking this","time":1491686888,"resto":120168112,"id":"5fkJGXz4","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":120185326,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)17:28:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"what is the point of this tweet i dont get it","time":1491686893,"resto":120168112,"id":"JzRqT75N","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120185345,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)17:28:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120168112\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120168112<\/a><br><br>So he didn&#039;t want to do any real damage.<br><br>You should&#039;ve let us know your real intentions a bit sooner, Donald, you had us worried.","time":1491686901,"resto":120168112,"id":"F+EHNTv7","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120185800,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)17:32:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"He target equipment and hangars on the airbase, but not the actual runway.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;what is reading comprehension<\/span>","time":1491687135,"resto":120168112,"id":"9TSw2RlX","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120186019,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)17:33:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120168112\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120168112<\/a>","filename":"1mwg85","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":352,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":88,"tim":1491687229766,"time":1491687229,"md5":"IXWUw3W6qZpYTwqyrbBxbA==","fsize":70227,"resto":120168112,"id":"3zRIEea0","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":120186153,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)17:34:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120168112\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120168112<\/a><br>I don&#039;t get what he is saying, that it was a mistake to aim for runways?

Trump and Xi are having dinner. Someone brings out a laptop and opens it up. Trump says &quot;Hey Xi check this out...&quot; as Trump is explaning what is happening on the screen Xi realizes Donald Trump of Apprentice fame just launched dozens of missles from Mar-a-Lago Golf Club and Resort. At this point he looks down at President Trump&#039;s plate and sees a steak cut in half. It is WELL DONE. It now dawns on him that Trump truly is a madman and is serious. Xi thinks back to the last time he had dinner with Obama. Obama nibbled on some quiche while discussing his favorite gay cuisine. Xi realizes Trump is not the same man, he signals an aid and tells him in gookspeak to get the Norks back on the leash.","time":1491689532,"resto":120168112,"id":"aKIYjbye","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":120191033,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)18:12:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120168260\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120168260<\/a>","filename":"1483139846388","ext":".png","w":255,"h":255,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491689564029,"time":1491689564,"md5":"Lc9g1to9JRUvQKA0dfS\/qQ==","fsize":44736,"resto":120168112,"id":"+dpw3Snj","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":120191074,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)18:13:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120190894\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120190894<\/a><br>https:\/\/ discord.gg\/PNShu<br><br>oops, posted it again","time":1491689583,"resto":120168112,"id":"NcZ3ltRp","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120191348,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)18:15:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120190362\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120190362<\/a><br>Bump for you.","time":1491689706,"resto":120168112,"id":"xicA+9vd","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120191360,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)18:15:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120190362\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120190362<\/a><br><br>le you are le stupid le neocon le drumpf le btfo!!11!!11 le le le le!!!!<br><br>also u r from the doland lolloololololo XDXDXDXDXDXDXDXDDXDXDDDDDDD","time":1491689711,"resto":120168112,"id":"aOMf53e7","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120191741,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)18:18:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120191074\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120191074<\/a>","filename":"a7903e10781167fd7343e80e4b8023b80aa9296f4a54e7dd60cdf1a9c8fc6ce0","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":678,"tn_w":117,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491689889090,"time":1491689889,"md5":"Y7afPVXad0rPfl8vibGoYA==","fsize":43380,"resto":120168112,"id":"sRzmAxTJ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120191784,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)18:18:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120169772\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120169772<\/a>","filename":"1482943500350","ext":".jpg","w":533,"h":585,"tn_w":113,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491689908263,"time":1491689908,"md5":"L33fYqn05YUU\/ujkhA+Erw==","fsize":106598,"resto":120168112,"id":"+dpw3Snj","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":120191825,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)18:18:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120176671\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120176671<\/a><br><br>This is me","time":1491689925,"resto":120168112,"id":"z+OxXGFi","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":120191965,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)18:19:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120187912\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120187912<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;without actually hurting anyone.<\/span><br>Except killing Syrians, helping ISIS advance and alienating his entire actual base.<br><br>A FUCKING LEAF","time":1491689998,"resto":120168112,"id":"+dpw3Snj","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":120192031,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)18:20:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120174142\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120174142<\/a>","filename":"1482955506838","ext":".jpg","w":252,"h":291,"tn_w":108,"tn_h":124,"tim":1491690026165,"time":1491690026,"md5":"O1pjrr+1KcO7OAYP5LcJzQ==","fsize":17335,"resto":120168112,"id":"+dpw3Snj","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":120192075,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)18:20:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120168112\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120168112<\/a><br>It&#039;s REAL","filename":"fat fuck from JP","ext":".gif","w":229,"h":176,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":96,"tim":1491690047136,"time":1491690047,"md5":"0rlPw2cvYXRDvytMhkisOA==","fsize":1010731,"resto":120168112,"id":"ZxlNg2Ia","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120192119,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)18:21:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120168112\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120168112<\/a><br><br>Still with Trump now more than ever.<br><br>Wall is still being built.

This weedkiller isn\u2019t just used on GMOs but on 70 different food crops in the U.S. \u2013 it\u2019s in practically everything Americans eat. So, if glyphosate is causing cancer and other diseases, I want to know about it and get it out of our food \u2013 don\u2019t you?<br>Stating the obvious: Monsanto makes billions off of Roundup sales, so they don\u2019t want anyone to question its safety. Some never-before-seen confidential documents just released in a court case against Monsanto give us a glimpse into how they are working to influence the EPA (who is in charge of determining whether they are allowed to sell Roundup anymore) and undermine any efforts to ban its use. These documents show what many of us have known and suspected for quite some time\u2026 Monsanto is manipulating scientific research and has gotten some EPA officials on their side who seem to be helping them cover-up the health dangers of Roundup so they can keep it on the market.<br>Keep in mind\u2026 Monsanto and the EPA both do NOT want the public to see these internal emails!

When the plaintiffs asked the court to make the records public, both Monsanto and the EPA objected. The judge didn\u2019t agree with their objections and threatened to sanction Monsanto if they continued trying to seal documents and found it in the best interest of the public to release them for all of us to see,\u201ceven if Monsanto doesn\u2019t like what they say\u201d.<br>The public interest group U.S. Right To Know is publishing these documents in their entirety on their website here.

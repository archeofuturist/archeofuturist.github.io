I like both of them. Chomsky hasn&#039;t read much Harris, and says as much. He has a bad view of Harris because they have a fundamental disagreement, and Chomsky is a bit of a cranky old man.<br><br>Chomsky thinks results matter. America bombed a pharmaceutical plant. Probably on purpose. The result: A lot of dead people.<br><br>Harris thinks intentions matter. If ISIS had our weapons and we had theirs, they&#039;d genocide us. Since we aren&#039;t genociding them, that means we are better than them.<br><br>Chomsky understands Harris as meaning that we didn&#039;t intend to blow up the pharmaceutical plant, or that we didn&#039;t intend to do any of the large number of things we have done wrong. Chomsky thinks is bullshit and concludes Harris is a deluded pro-state shill.<br><br>If I had to sum up, Chomsky didn&#039;t take the time to fully understand Harris.","time":1490934341,"resto":119016047,"id":"exK5s2se","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119019584,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)00:28:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119019327\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119019327<\/a><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=VjN<wbr>JX64cBOE","time":1490934503,"resto":119016047,"id":"exK5s2se","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119019840,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)00:30:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"Two hacks","time":1490934650,"resto":119016047,"id":"x1GVsmRe","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119020801,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)00:40:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119016047\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119016047<\/a><br>How is Croaksky even still alive?","time":1490935204,"resto":119016047,"id":"nyilsvbu","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

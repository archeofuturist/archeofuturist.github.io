Height<br>This is the entry level. Remember when you were a kid and couldn&#039;t get in the roller coaster because you were not tall enough? Well life works the same way. You might be tall enough for the babies amusement rides (short women) but people will never take you seriously if you&#039;re not tall enough for the real amusement rides.<br><br>2. Attractiveness<br>Let&#039;s pretend you&#039;re playing for a football team<br>- If you&#039;re ugly you&#039;re basically part of the worst players of the team, you know the ones who only play 1-2 times per season and that even the strong supporters never heard of, that&#039;s you. Girls will use you (if they ever do) for a very limited time and throw you away on the first occasion. <br>- If you&#039;re average looking, you are part of the average players of the team, you can be replaced any time and it won&#039;t make a difference because they are lot of players just like you (just like real life). <br>- If you&#039;re pretty you are very valuable to the team and everyone loves you, if they lose you they will be really affected by it.<br><br>3. Money<br>Money establishes your league level. Let&#039;s imagine that you are an amateur football player, why do you think the major leagues would want you in their team? So basically, for women, an Ugly Rich guy is like a shitty football player but playing in a major league, therefor, even the absolute best player of all the amateur football teams stands no chance against even the worst major league player.<br><br>4. Sociability<br>Women don&#039;t really care about this one but if you don&#039;t do this they simply won&#039;t know that you exist. What good is the best player if he never play any game? How will the major leagues (high babes) notice him? He has to play a lot of games and get out, use any mean possible (confidence, social skills, lifestyle) to promote himself and eventually get noticed.","filename":"455","ext":".jpg","w":495,"h":630,"tn_w":196,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492873035626,"time":1492873035,"md5":"6XqS1c4Q\/oc7D0Q3YMWlAg==","fsize":92777,"resto":0,"id":"6vKVQU8K","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"hams-pill","country_name":"Canada","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

It&#039;s about the alleged Syrian gas attack purportedly done by Assad. Trump is being led astray by questionable Intel sources, there is clearly not enough evidence to conclude that this gas attack was done by Assad, or at all. As a proponent of the truth, I openly invite any and all weaponized autismos to find out what really happened in Syria. I don&#039;t believe for a second that American sources are reliable.<br><br>We&#039;ve found and acquired a flag within 24 hours four times in a row. Something like investigating Syria should be no problem. Thank you for your time.","filename":"17498786_266510510466993_5554923868885393409_n","ext":".jpg","w":720,"h":720,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491517843717,"time":1491517843,"md5":"kRn\/bea8HoyHS+mU9Jsc+A==","fsize":53989,"resto":0,"id":"5zdmKZql","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"this-is-an-open-call-to-any-interested-pollacks","country_name":"United States","replies":5,"images":2,"unique_ips":6},{"no":119807256,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)18:34:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119806690\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119806690<\/a><br>\/SG\/ is on it in the back ground <br><br>but all the shiling stops us from doing the job <br>we are raided by brain dead sheep <br>picture from the location of the attack <br>what we now for now it is artilery shell and from the looks its HE one not gas","filename":"e","ext":".png","w":1059,"h":710,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1491518070541,"time":1491518070,"md5":"J2W\/p6LXTorT378E0GoXnA==","fsize":1927926,"resto":119806690,"id":"o2fx65rt","country":"MK","m_img":1,"country_name":"Macedonia"},{"no":119807574,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)18:36:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119806690\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119806690<\/a><br><a href=\"\/diy\/\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;&gt;\/diy\/<\/a>","time":1491518204,"resto":119806690,"id":"VLHPrwEX","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119807757,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)18:37:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119807256\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119807256<\/a><br>They arent brain dead sheep, at least not their leadership.

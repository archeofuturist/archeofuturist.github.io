For some reason America has this new white man&#039;s burden to &quot;ensure&quot; the &quot;peace&quot; of the world for the betterment of mankind. <br><br>Give me a break. The only reason any empire conquers is resources and USA is no different. What makes you think they care about the world&#039;s livelihood? Instead of peace and freedom it&#039;s do what we want or something bad will happen. I wish they weren&#039;t so much sly dogs about it. <br><br>Trump and his new administration just can&#039;t fuck off from foreign affairs and therefore intervene with the countries being invaded serving as canon fodder. Let&#039;s say Syria. I&#039;d rather let Bashar, Isis and Russia just kill each other instead of USA joining and literally fucking everything up. <br><br>As for national issues, frankly I don&#039;t care about your archaic, bureaucracy riddled and outdated way of doing things so I have no opinion.","filename":"IMG_4287","ext":".jpg","w":2697,"h":2537,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":235,"tim":1493863523503,"time":1493863523,"md5":"t5seUIBI5a0QoOjBWDBXmg==","fsize":1159853,"resto":0,"id":"FwxBvpmv","country":"NZ","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"trump-fucking-sucks","country_name":"New Zealand","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

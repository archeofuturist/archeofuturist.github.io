All public knowledge of the attack indicates a false flag - but Trump may be sitting on undeniable evidence.<br><br>HOWEVER - it&#039;s irrelevant whether it&#039;s true or not in the grand scheme of things.<br><br>And this is why:<br>1. If it wasn&#039;t a false flag he responded appropriately. All he did was bomb an airfield - targeting aircraft and infrastructure while avoiding personnel - after warning the Russians. No Russian casualties = No WWIII. Currently conflicting reports on SAA casualties. Doesn&#039;t matter. By targeting the air base and not Assad&#039;s headquarters (like Libya) he demonstrated this had NOTHING to do with regime change. Just sending a message. Also, the way he was silent about this until the attack was is just what a President ought to do. That ought to scare the shit out of any other country.<br><br>2. He just put Assad in check while sedating Neo-Cons like McCain, and Israel (who are the people who would have supported the false flag). He&#039;s winning over support from people stonewalling him with a glorified firework show.<br><br>3. By pulling the trigger unannounced like this he&#039;s showing he&#039;s not fucking around with China or North Korea. No doubt a message to Iran as well.<br><br>4. Even if Syrian forces are grounded they still have Russian air support. Essentially nothing has changed strategically.<br><br>5. Another nail in the coffin for the Russian collusion narrative.","filename":"sa on syria","ext":".png","w":758,"h":548,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":90,"tim":1491584363462,"time":1491584363,"md5":"bGNi65w5zHqLKhbaC7i49Q==","fsize":69912,"resto":119976417,"id":"pUl0Vd9n","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119981904,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)12:59:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119981624\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119981624<\/a><br>If you want a pic reflecting reality you should remake it with trump with his mouth around the Jews cock.","time":1491584387,"resto":119976417,"id":"wS6IV1m3","country":"ZA","country_name":"South Africa"},{"no":119981941,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)13:00:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119978656\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119978656<\/a><br>I agree, this for the first time has actually shaken my faith in him.

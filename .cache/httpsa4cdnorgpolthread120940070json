The same is true for about 40 percent of regional educational centers (ROCs).<br><br>The only parties which did not support the motion were the center-right People&#039;s Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD), the Christian-right Reformed Political Party (SGP), and the right-wing Forum for Democracy (FvD) party.<br><br>The LGBT-friendly proposal comes after heterosexual Dutch men across the Netherlands and elsewhere held hands with other men earlier this month, in a symbol of solidarity after a hand-holding gay couple was attacked in Arnhem. Images of the movement were posted on social media under the hashtag #allemannenhandinhand (all men, holding hands).","filename":"geert","ext":".jpg","w":1249,"h":1600,"tn_w":195,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492106874213,"time":1492106874,"md5":"XZN9Pe0ZZdwkc0JcyqFpQA==","fsize":248537,"resto":0,"id":"Vx4h+k0s","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"dutch-schools-must-teach-lgbt-awareness","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":120941187,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)14:16:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"Dutch politicians are a joke but FvD is based.","time":1492107366,"resto":120940070,"id":"RmBFUc2z","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"}]}

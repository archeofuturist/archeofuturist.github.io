I think it&#039;s entirely possible meme warriors made that difference. But it&#039;s such a small margin so could have anything. But I do think more older people we&#039;re swayed by facebook-boosted fake news from russia and macedonian teens than young people were swayed by memes. also I bet a lot of meme makers were paid, though not all by russians (some by folks like palmer luckey). But still, the fact russians did the bigger part and may have orchestrated doing that with trump, sucks but it&#039;s a bigger story. memers accomplished something tho, but they were more of the secondary villain. russia was joker, \/pol\/ was two-face.","time":1491028229,"resto":119152343,"id":"vhZXrMHT","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119154526,"now":"04\/01\/17(Sat)02:33:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"forgive english, i am Russia.<br><br>i come to study computer and science at American university. i am here little time and i am very hard stress. i am hacker also and this very difficult for me, i am very political person. i never act to be hacker with other politic before. but after i am in america 6 weeks i am my friend together he is hacker also.

Alex Salmond was a genuinely top-class politician (not a compliment imo, but he was) who would have definitely become a &#039;Big Beast&#039; and potential Minister if he&#039;d joined any of the major British parties. <br><br>Nicola Sturgeon is a 2nd rate local hack who inherited a party in a major position of power courtesy of Salmond but genuinely has nothing going for her beyond her gender. <br><br>The Scottish Conservatives (who aren&#039;t really conservative, but anyway) have a far more likeable and capable female leader in Ruth Davidson. I&#039;ve genuinely no idea who the Lib Dems and Labour currently have leading them but Sturgeon certainly won&#039;t be increasing the number of SNP MSPs in the next election - it will come down to whether or not there&#039;s a competent enough Labour leader to revive them as the Scottish Tories are (despite gains) still too toxic a brand to plausibly win Scottish elections in the next decade or so.","time":1490813213,"resto":118815166,"id":"Uivk3yw1","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118817676,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)14:46:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;nuttall, milkman, and literally who green party man<\/span>","filename":"1489633191766","ext":".jpg","w":125,"h":125,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490813214220,"time":1490813214,"md5":"gOUPWjoVyxqcphqtHLftBQ==","fsize":2283,"resto":118815166,"id":"38S64eVw","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118817680,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)14:46:55","name":"The triplord formerly known as Not Bomber Rimmer","com":"<a href=\"#p118816736\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118816736<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Tfw Laura Kuenssberg replaces him<\/span>","filename":"Laura Kuenssberg2","ext":".jpg","w":318,"h":441,"tn_w":90,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490813215902,"time":1490813215,"md5":"DD2iNNq51Au+k7omSAk\/PA==","fsize":57789,"resto":118815166,"id":"iJFH2dts","country":"GB","trip":"!!FJ60XUrqjrt","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118817687,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)14:46:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"why do they always ask tim farrons fucking opinion, nobody gives a shit.","time":1490813219,"resto":118815166,"id":"HvsstCiN","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118817708,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)14:47:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;tfw will never be in Farron&#039;s band<\/span>","filename":"o-FARRONBAND-570","ext":".jpg","w":570,"h":699,"tn_w":101,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490813227950,"time":1490813227,"md5":"teZaPd4OaKHgIw9HZEtvaQ==","fsize":75020,"resto":118815166,"id":"ALltF+Ea","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118817770,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)14:47:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118817347\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118817347<\/a><br>Fuck off and give them this Slap down.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;We had one to join.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;We were lied to and had many powers taken with no referendum.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;We had one rightfully to leave.<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/YI6mzHkx3xA<br><br>The ABSOLUTE STATE of Farron and his sour milk face deal.","filename":"Farron Got Milk","ext":".png","w":1044,"h":1920,"tn_w":67,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490813260986,"time":1490813260,"md5":"5GhrFmmn11dpDMk1GDgRiw==","fsize":3064492,"resto":118815166,"id":"zzYvnMHz","country":"GB","m_img":1,"country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118817780,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)14:47:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118817708\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118817708<\/a><br>Name my band?","time":1490813267,"resto":118815166,"id":"0+lBMXJY","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118817802,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)14:47:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118815360\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118815360<\/a><br>Tell us more about this please?

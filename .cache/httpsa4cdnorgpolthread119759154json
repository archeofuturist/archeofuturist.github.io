This is because women need more calcium during pregnancy and lactation. The body synthesizes vitamin D from sunlight, which helps it absorb calcium. Females evolved to have lighter skin so their bodies absorb more calcium.<br>Therefore lighter skin is favored because it would mean that woman is safer to impregnate than darker women.<br>Of course this is all vestigial and in the modern world you can have vitamin D and calcium in abundance.<br><br>https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/2015010<wbr>5164235\/http:\/\/www.bgsu.edu\/departm<wbr>ents\/chem\/faculty\/leontis\/chem447\/P<wbr>DF_files\/Jablonski_skin_color_2000.<wbr>pdf","filename":"Hazuki_Naho","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":750,"tn_w":83,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491496762102,"time":1491496762,"md5":"4ejxuhP4Yi\/dqJxAKfY0nQ==","fsize":135800,"resto":119759154,"id":"3WnXbdmo","country":"CR","country_name":"Costa Rica"},{"no":119761845,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)12:48:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119759154\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119759154<\/a><br>varies<br><br>In many parts of Asia and especially in China, Never and Japan where they almost never saw whites, they still valued light sin. Because light skin -especially women - meant they didn&#039;t work, spend their time indoors, they are nobility. It meant they spent their time in art and some other deep shit. Gradually it became to be seen as nobler,and elegant.

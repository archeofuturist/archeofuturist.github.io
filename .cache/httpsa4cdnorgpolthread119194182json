Think about your happiness, health, and your effect on others. Are you having a positive effect on those around you? Are you making the most out of your own life in a positive manner? Think carefully, think honestly.<br>Most of you would of course answer \u201cyes\u201d. But is that necessarily the truth?<br>It is an answer to be expected, everyone likes to think they are leading a good life, everyone likes to think they are having a positive effect on others, everyone likes to think they are improving themselves, and by extension the world around them. So then why do you feel vaguely unhappy? Why is the world such a terrible place? If we are all having a net positive effect, why isn\u2019t it working?<br>The answer is of course one that you already know, but don\u2019t want to face. What we are doing, and how we are acting to ourselves and each other is fundamentally wrong. You have to accept that the reason for the poor state of the world and of the country is down to the self-destructive and self-obsessed nature of the currently accepted behavioral and political norms. If you accept that then you can begin to pick up the pieces of our frankly shattered society and put it together in a positive way. If not, then the catastrophic effects of this negative behavior will have serious repercussions for all for years to come; a broken and cruel society, crippled by vice, debt and lies, ruined and broken for everyone, forever.

Think about your happiness, health, and your effect on others. Are you having a positive effect on those around you? Are you making the most out of your own life in a positive manner? Think carefully, think honestly.<br>Most of you would of course answer \u201cyes\u201d. But is that necessarily the truth?<br>It is an answer to be expected, everyone likes to think they are leading a good life, everyone likes to think they are having a positive effect on others, everyone likes to think they are improving themselves, and by extension the world around them. So then why do you feel vaguely unhappy? Why is the world such a terrible place? If we are all having a net positive effect, why isn\u2019t it working?<br>The answer is of course one that you already know, but don\u2019t want to face. What we are doing, and how we are acting to ourselves and each other is fundamentally wrong. You have to accept that the reason for the poor state of the world and of the country is down to the self-destructive and self-obsessed nature of the currently accepted behavioral and political norms. If you accept that then you can begin to pick up the pieces of our frankly shattered society and put it together in a positive way. If not, then the catastrophic effects of this negative behavior will have serious repercussions for all for years to come; a broken and cruel society, crippled by vice, debt and lies, ruined and broken for everyone, forever. It could even be seen as a crime to not change your ways.","time":1491141230,"resto":119194182,"id":"lU+PhrpT","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119201122,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)09:54:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119201076\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119201076<\/a><br>If we take the behavior of those engaging in these destructive attitudes at this university as a standard, and multiply it across the country to include those currently in education across the country, and then if we assume this behavior has been happening in a similar fashion for the last 30 years then you can begin to see the scale of the problem. Every time you personally engage with these negative behaviors is making the world a little bit worse, piece by piece. You might think it is ok to party and get drunk every once in a while, who cares what you put in your body? It\u2019s yours after all right? What harm can it do, I\u2019m not hurting anyone. This is just not true; your actions are having destructive effects that go beyond your reckoning. <br>So then you have perhaps decided to try and be a better person. But how do you even begin? You of course begin with yourself. Focus on excluding outside influence, social pressure, institutional pressure, peer pressure to engage in immorality. That means traditional media, non-traditional media, groups of peers, any opinions of the staff and faculties should be immediately and irrevocably discarded. Focus solely on your studies. Do not attempt to engage them on any level other than claiming any educational benefit for yourself. Do not let yourself be infected by this destructive immorality.

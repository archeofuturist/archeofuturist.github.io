Regarding the use of coke, Henryk Tauber, a member of one of the cremation Sonderkommando in Auschwitz-Birkenau, testified, \u201c\u2026we used the coke only to light the fire of the furnace initially, for fatty bodies burned of their own accord thanks to the combustion of the body fat. On occasion, when coke was in short supply, we would put some straw and wood in the ash bins under the muffles, and once the fat of the body began to burn the other bodies would catch light themselves.\u201d[5] According to Tauber\u2019s testimony, there was no direct correspondence between the amount of coke use and the number of corpses that could be burned. Once the fires were started, it did not take as much coke to burn more bodies.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;There is proof that the ovens were designed to reduce fuel usage if continuously operating. A critical piece of evidence comes from a Topf &amp; Sons memo, dated March 11, 1943; Topf &amp; Sons designed and manufactured the ovens used in Auschwitz-Birkenau. The memo, headed \u201cEstimation of coke usage for Crematorium II K L,\u201d suggested that the coke usage could be \u201creduced by one third\u201d if the ovens were operating on a continuous basis.[6]<\/span><br><br>Furthermore, we know that coke was not always used for the disposal of corpses at Auschwitz-Birkenau. For example, in late 1944, the Nazis murdered between 8,000 and 10,000 Hungarian Jews per day. This was the peak of the so-called Hungarian Action and the number of bodies requiring cremation exceeded the daily capacities of the ovens. Open-air burning pits were dug behind Crema\/Gas Chamber 5 and beside a cottage (which had operated as a gas chamber prior to the four dedicated gas chambers, which started operation in 1943).","time":1493175109,"resto":122829204,"id":"EP0dB+bX","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122831935,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)22:53:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122831738\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122831738<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;we used the coke only to light the fire of the furnace initially, for fatty bodies burned of their own accord thanks to the combustion of the body fat<\/span>","filename":"1472144939638","ext":".jpg","w":491,"h":418,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":106,"tim":1493175205625,"time":1493175205,"md5":"iYLHiZ803Gy0EGEae8ivGw==","fsize":31718,"resto":122829204,"id":"83utW0A5","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":122831969,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)22:53:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122830540\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122830540<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;no zyklon in the auschwitz showers<\/span><br>the lie unravels...","time":1493175220,"resto":122829204,"id":"6DMDnHG0","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122831980,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)22:53:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122831000\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122831000<\/a>","filename":"IMG_2320","ext":".jpg","w":800,"h":565,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":88,"tim":1493175229211,"time":1493175229,"md5":"BbEByumWnrLJwtChHZxmfQ==","fsize":74114,"resto":122829204,"id":"EP0dB+bX","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122832078,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)22:54:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122831301\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122831301<\/a><br>I said death camp not concentration camp","time":1493175274,"resto":122829204,"id":"rqSvJ0Ai","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122832136,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)22:54:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122831980\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122831980<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;1951<\/span><br>am I missing something","time":1493175297,"resto":122829204,"id":"83utW0A5","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":122832249,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)22:55:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122831935\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122831935<\/a><br><a href=\"#p122831969\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122831969<\/a><br>This is all you faggots got?

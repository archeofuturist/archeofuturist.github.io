He wasn&#039;t good and fucked up a lot. Amnesty alone fucked the right for a long time. I argued with a boomer conservative that hated Trump and i&#039;ll never forget how vicious and petty he was in his attack on Trump and blind defending of Reagan just refusing to debate and hurling insults at me instead. Boomers are like children. Things that were familiar to them when they were young they defend blindly and won&#039;t say otherwise because that will mean that part of their life was a big lie. A Sears that was open by me for years recently closed and a boomer neighbor said it was a sign of the end of the world and that millennials are stupid for not shopping there. I told her she is wrong and all that shows is people use Amazon more than anything. Oh she got so mad at that and called me all kinds of names.

The economic downturn\/stagflation actually started under Nixon (though Carter took the blame), but wasn&#039;t caused by political action (by Nixon, Ford, or Carter). Basically, Carter is blamed for all sorts of shit he had no control over. In truth he was an average president. Obama also wasn&#039;t shit. He had some serious problems, but I&#039;d still put him in the upper half of presidents. I&#039;m with you on Bush and semi-with you on LBJ (I disagree with much of his policy, but I don&#039;t know that I&#039;d call him shit). Strangely enough, many consider Bill Clinton to be the best president since Eisenhower, but this is due to nothing more than luck that the economy was good, he was average. <br><br><a href=\"#p119710843\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119710843<\/a><br>Don&#039;t forget that Reagan also escalated the drug war causing mass incarceration and super harsh penalties for trivial shit like simple position.

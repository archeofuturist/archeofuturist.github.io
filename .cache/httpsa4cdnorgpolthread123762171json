They sought recognition for their trade union and improvements in wages and working conditions. Police Commissioner Edwin Upton Curtis denied that police officers had any right to form a union, much less one affiliated with a larger organization like the American Federation of Labor (AFL). Attempts at reconciliation between the Commissioner and the police officers, particularly on the part of Boston&#039;s Mayor Andrew James Peters, failed.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;During the strike, Boston experienced several nights of lawlessness, although property damage was not extensive.

The strike proved a setback for labor unions, and the AFL discontinued its attempts to organize police officers for another two decades. Coolidge won the Republican nomination for vice-president of the U.S. in the 1920 presidential election.<\/span>","time":1493730585,"resto":123762171,"id":"KKBLSOP9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123765364,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)09:09:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"everything about him, and Thatcher while we&#039;re at it, should be boxed up and forgotten<br><br>Conservatism became de-industrialization, the importation of cheap labor to benefit the &#039;business that is America!&#039;, vague wishy-washy warmed over egalitarianism, and obedience to Israel.

He brought some respect back to the whitehouse, and most importantly he was a narrative changer for the Russians that the country needed.

In the 1970s both USSR and USA looked weak, faltering, and with the election the Americans seemingly revived themselves with a charismatic leader. The Soviet subjects would look across at America and say &quot;we are failing but they are not.&quot; Reagan&#039;s image, attitude, and policy at the time they came along were critical to the global culture war aspect of the Cold War. His presidency was in THE critical time for the Cold War resolution and you cannot ignore it.

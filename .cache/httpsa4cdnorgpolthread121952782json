It&#039;s ambitious, and sort of falls apart near the end, but you cannot deny that it&#039;s a solid game - strikes a balance between the speed that DaS3 attempted, and the slow weightiness of DaS2. Now before you go squealing<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;b-b-but that&#039;s not weightiness, it&#039;s sluggishness!<\/span><br>Let me explain.<br><br>Dark Souls 2 is the &#039;heaviest&#039; of the two. It has, by far, the most content of all three games, and the best DLC. Gameplay too is another point of contention, but it&#039;s defnitely serviceable - the hitboxes are fucking shit, but you can adjust to that. It doesn&#039;t justify it, but beneath that layer of crust, you get a more weighty experience than DaS1. Everything&#039;s slower, and more sluggish - it feels like you&#039;re a guy with a sword rather than a trained knight, if you will. The viability of varied builds, too, is the best - it has the most options.<br><br>Dark Souls 3 tried to be Bloodborne, but removed the protag&#039;s mobility. The enemies are fast and the weapons are slow, albiet quite varied.

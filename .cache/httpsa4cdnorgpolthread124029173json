I know their symbol is banned now along with communist symbols in Hungary, but how does the average Hungarian view them? Is Miklos Horthy seen as a defender of his nation or a tyrant by the average modern Hungarian? Also, how similar was the ideology of the Arrow Cross to National Socialism or Italian Fascism, and does it have any similarities or connections with the modern Jobbik party?","filename":"220px-Flag_of_the_Arrow_Cross_Party_1937_to_1942.svg","ext":".png","w":220,"h":132,"tn_w":220,"tn_h":132,"tim":1493878732350,"time":1493878732,"md5":"MzpdIgSJKZp+do+4KAvG5A==","fsize":3714,"resto":0,"id":"laxlY+79","country":"LV","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"hungarian-arrow-cross-movement","country_name":"Latvia","replies":10,"images":1,"unique_ips":5},{"no":124031052,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)02:41:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"I would say that the majority of the people view them as idiots, who prolonged an already lost war.

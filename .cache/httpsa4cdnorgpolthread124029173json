I know their symbol is banned now along with communist symbols in Hungary, but how does the average Hungarian view them? Is Miklos Horthy seen as a defender of his nation or a tyrant by the average modern Hungarian? Also, how similar was the ideology of the Arrow Cross to National Socialism or Italian Fascism, and does it have any similarities or connections with the modern Jobbik party?","filename":"220px-Flag_of_the_Arrow_Cross_Party_1937_to_1942.svg","ext":".png","w":220,"h":132,"tn_w":220,"tn_h":132,"tim":1493878732350,"time":1493878732,"md5":"MzpdIgSJKZp+do+4KAvG5A==","fsize":3714,"resto":0,"id":"laxlY+79","country":"LV","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"hungarian-arrow-cross-movement","country_name":"Latvia","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":124031052,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)02:41:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"I would say that the majority of the people view them as idiots, who prolonged an already lost war. Horthy had nothing to do with them though, and had them locked up in jail alongside the communists for as long as he could.<br>Horthy is a divisive figure to this day, thanks to the 40 years of commie brainwashing. For some he is german lackey, intent on destroying the country - to others he is a national hero, who tried to do the best he could in the shitty situation we had after Trianon.","time":1493880084,"resto":124029173,"id":"5+1dfDz6","country":"HU","country_name":"Hungary"}]}

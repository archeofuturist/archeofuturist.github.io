It sounded batshit crazy but there&#039;s a lot of truth to it. They are creating an interlinked hivemind with all of the people on the planet, using radio waves similar to wifi. It&#039;s been known since the beginning of the 20th century that radio waves can alter and manipulate consciousness, and with advanced technology can even link minds together in a kind of &quot;internet of brains&quot;. The elites are in contact with aliens and that is where a lot of this technology is coming from, and is the reason why we have seen such a massive acceleration in technological progress in the last century. I&#039;m not sure what exactly the links to CERN are but it&#039;s clear how HAARP could play a large role in this. The endgame is a Borg-like collection of interconnected minds with no individual or independent thought. A subservient, docile slave race for the elite to exploit.","time":1491691754,"resto":120177863,"id":"blSYNSSm","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120196337,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)18:53:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120195785\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120195785<\/a><br>yes, it is the mark of the beast, it is to make human inhuman, it is to distort and disrupt just for the sake of mischievous.<br><br>the pitts of hell are open","time":1491692038,"resto":120177863,"id":"gd6SX7Zt","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120196650,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)18:56:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120179222\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120179222<\/a><br>The Lincolnshire Poacher?","time":1491692180,"resto":120177863,"id":"xvVeLG0U","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120198036,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)19:08:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120195785\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120195785<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;They are creating an interlinked hivemind with all of the people on the planet, using radio waves similar to wifi.<\/span><br><br>Sounds like serial experiments lain.<br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=dni<wbr>75S0GC2M","time":1491692893,"resto":120177863,"id":"Jdw193rS","country":"DO","country_name":"Dominican Republic"}]}

They&#039;re retarded simple as. Go to your cheapest state school, live at home\/commute, study hard, get a decent major with job prospects, and you&#039;ll have minimal debt. I did it. 4 years, $5k in debt total, mediocre grades (2.8). CS meme degree getting into IT. $65k a year. Can&#039;t afford it, don&#039;t pay for it or sign up for the loan and understand what you&#039;re doing. Why do so many people struggle with this and how are we going to fix the inevitable bubble?","filename":"1423886528436","ext":".png","w":561,"h":590,"tn_w":237,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491197132534,"time":1491197132,"md5":"UgAVM4xaZJdeSmAUwGDd4Q==","fsize":333440,"resto":0,"id":"x5dprY+b","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"getting-into-student-loan-debt","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":119295269,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)01:27:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"You&#039;re right. That said, 18 year olds shouldn&#039;t be able to sign up for tens of thousands of dollar loans. They&#039;re retarded. And their boomer parents who think it&#039;s still 1970 and a college degree will guarantee a $100k job and who co-sign the loans are even more retarded.","time":1491197234,"resto":119295111,"id":"G\/jihFSA","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

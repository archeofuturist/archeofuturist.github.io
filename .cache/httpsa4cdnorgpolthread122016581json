For instance, it\u2019s been stated erroneously that none of their machines could have flown without use of a track and a derrick (catapult). Remarkably, some accounts have even placed a \u201ccatapult\u201d at the end of the track laid out on the sands of Kitty Hawk, to give the 1903 Flyer a pull into the air. That, of course, did not happen. A strong headwind did assist the 1903 Flyer to take off, a matter which has been the source of some controversy. One speculation sometimes encountered is that a longer track at Kill Devil Hill would have allowed the 1903 Flyer to make an unassisted take off. If the 1903 Flyer could have taken off on its own that December day, then whether or not a headwind assisted the take off no longer matters. The \u2018evidence\u2019 cited in support of that proposition is the fact that the 1904 Flyer took off and flew using a long track. However, things are not that clear, for the 1904 Flyer had, as noted, a more powerful (by 33%) engine operating at a higher r.p.m. relative to the propellers.&quot;<br>http:\/\/www.thewrightbrothers.org\/19<wbr>04.html","time":1492717038,"resto":122016581,"id":"MMwHJjhj","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122031601,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)15:38:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122030704\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122030704<\/a><br>Provide evidence, or you&#039;re a dumb fuck.","time":1492717102,"resto":122016581,"id":"MMwHJjhj","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122031874,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)15:40:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122031033\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122031033<\/a><br>The reason why anglos invent sports is because it provides an informal arena for us to demonstrate how infinitely superior we are. <br><br>Also it civilises the darkies.

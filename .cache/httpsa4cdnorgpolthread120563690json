Then one week where I use the prep H to push the roids back into place. I got refered to a surgeon recently and he said I had a bad case and set me up for surgery. They decided to do a colenistimy (colon probe. where I guess they pump you full of air and put a tube all the way up). I did not know that it was that extensive or I might of gone without it..at least not with this surgery. I was told afterwards that I had some of the largest they had seen. Also the colen test showed some polups they had to burn out. They did not look cancerous.<br><br>I had trouble gettin cleaned out prior to surgery due to the pain and the opiates. I awoke after 2 hours of surgery. I had packing in me and was told to go home, take a bath, and they would come out. I had terriable cramps and gut pain, prostate pain, and severe anus pain. I have lots of stitches down there. I was leaking blood everywhere. I took several baths and finally the packing came out. I took stool softeners and drank a lot. Finally the first meal, or what was left over from before, came out in the bath. I didnt have a full bowel push because of the pain but a bunch of crap, in small strings, some packing, and a huge amount of blood came out. I would say a pint.<br><br>One the third day I had an involentary bowell push but came up empty. I forced a bowel movement and produced a large pile of soft serve crap which was full of blood. It becomes a real fight to live. I have some blood a fecal leakage which I clean up each time with a bath or a soaking wet warm wash cloth. Then I fold a washcloth in half and put in between my swollen cheeks until dry. They shave you down there and the stubble that grows back is very painful to the opposite side. I have never felt such pain. Each day has been a little better except for the third which was worse. <br><br>If you dont hear from me I am ok... or really bad.","filename":"greenpill","ext":".jpg","w":1238,"h":940,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":94,"tim":1491894362074,"time":1491894362,"md5":"z+1TrxO4\/cDoitV3peKikQ==","fsize":119533,"resto":120563690,"id":"0mywmS3K","country":"CA","m_img":1,"country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120567736,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)03:06:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120567425\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120567425<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I make thread appealing to ethoes<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;People reply because I appealed to ethoes<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Retarded faggot makes thread appealing to logos<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Nobody cares because only retarded faggots focus on logos<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;NU-POL MUH INTELLECT RAAAAAAA<\/span><br><br>Leave fag","time":1491894363,"resto":120563690,"id":"3ctxEfqa","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120567754,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)03:06:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120567655\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120567655<\/a><br>Yeah take our $800 in United Bucks, make sure to use them before the end of the year on another of our flights before they expire :^)","time":1491894380,"resto":120563690,"id":"sbgCTyJC","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120567785,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)03:06:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120567204\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120567204<\/a><br>It&#039;s probably more like this<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;GIB FOOD ANON<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;no, fuck off slant-eyed chink, I paid for this&quot;<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;OHHHH ANON I SUPA MAD NAO<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;calls Chinese mafia<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;OP gets beat up<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;people record this<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;make a fit and want to sue<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;news makes it to china<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;somewhere on a chinese messageboard a thread is started<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;LOOK AT RETARDED WHITEY <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;SHOUD HAVE GIVEN UP HIS KUNG PAO CHICKEN<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;FUCK ENTITLED WHITES<\/span>","time":1491894403,"resto":120563690,"id":"KSrjWa\/q","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":120567807,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)03:06:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120567490\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120567490<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;A paying customer is entitled to the service he is paid for?<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Lets bash his head in<\/span><br>And you are defending your jewish masters like the little fucciboi you are.

I guess they either were needed in an instant due to crew shortages in Kentucky or it was planned long before that they&#039;re booked on this flight and just hoped less people would take this flight. As United asked passengers while they already had a seat I suspect the latter. This means that the four crew members were vital for another United flight and not letting them fly would&#039;ve cost United tens of thousands of dollars. As a passenger I&#039;ve often seen the situation of an overbooking and especially American and British citizens simply refused to release their seat even if they would&#039;ve received a monetary compensation worth more than their ticket and a rebooking to another flight which would&#039;ve brought them earlier. <br>Now take a look at those videos dragging off this &quot;doctor&quot;, I&#039;ve had people telling me they&#039;re important businessmen and CEO&#039;s while travelling with tickets worth less than a fancy pair of shoes and they themself were dressed in sandals with socks and the cheapest clothes around, one passenger once told me he was &quot;on a diplomatic mission&quot; while looking like a hillbilly hick demanding a free rebooking. Also United asked ALL passengers before 4 got chosen and nobody wanted to give up their seat. Even when the police dragged the asian off nobody said they would leave the aircraft in his stead. What they did was being shocked and appaled and I can guarantee you some will try and succeed with suing United for the emotional trauma.","time":1491895631,"resto":120563690,"id":"GQfQvWL+","country":"AT","country_name":"Austria"},{"no":120569383,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)03:27:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120569156\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120569156<\/a><br>I&#039;ll give it a look, thanks lmao","time":1491895632,"resto":120563690,"id":"2CypsOUh","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120569399,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)03:27:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"The dude was being childish for no reason at all.

But nobody took them up on it. After everyone had boarded the plane, United upped the offer to $800 for anyone willing to get off. Again, it got no takers.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;So, the airline decided to do the &quot;fair&quot; thing and have a computer randomly pick four passengers, who were then told to get off the plane.

Yes, United&#039;s contract of carriage gives them the ability to bump passengers.

At some point, there would have been a rush to give up seats.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The result: Everyone would have gone away happy. The passengers who agreed to get off the flight would have received something they valued more than arriving on time, and United would have been able to get its own employees where they needed to be without raising a fuss.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Instead, United tried to impose its own form of price controls and then have the police enforce its nonmarket decision.<\/span>","time":1491896213,"resto":120563690,"id":"eomL56l5","country":"VN","country_name":"Vietnam"},{"no":120570090,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)03:36:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120569539\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120569539<\/a><br><a href=\"#p120569720\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120569720<\/a><br>Yeah it&#039;s a standard clause from every airline.

The jist is that a advanced group of non-sentient Supercomputers will be the sole lawmaking body of a nation. It will use information from a wide range of credible sources with as little as much bias as possible to run an advanced simulation of different solutions to a debate and create laws from the simulations that benefit the most amount of people in the nation. Laws made by the computer can be overturned by a council of humans if the law proved disasterous<br><br>Why Computers? Couldn&#039;t we do as better with humans?<br><br>The thing with humans is that they are flawed. Human politicians are known to be corrupt, lie to achieve power, and to not care about the average man. Humans have also been known to discredit facts to push their own agenda and.

The sole reason for the creation of the Supercomputers is to improve the standard of living for the most people and to use logic and reason.<br><br>I&#039;m tired of seeing people pushing and shoving each other for power while leaving the rest of the population in the dust.

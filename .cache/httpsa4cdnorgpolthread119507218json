In 1956 Soviet leader Joseph Stalin\u2019s crimes were revealed and in the 1970s the violent aspects of Chairman Mao\u2019s dictatorship became more widely known, resulting in many people losing their faith in \u201ccommunism.\u201d Nonetheless, whether in Europe or globally, communism was more than these dictatorships, and we need to allow for complexity and contradictions when we study its history. Many millions of women and men gave their lives in the struggles to establish or defend socialist or communist states. These states provided their male and female citizens with legal, social and economic rights and security that many people are lacking nowadays. For millions of people around the world, the Soviet Union was a land of hope. The Soviet Union had achieved impressive economic growth by the 1950s, it promoted women\u2019s emancipation, anti-racism and anti-colonialism, and supported progressive movements worldwide. An understanding of either the Soviet Union or China as one-dimensional totalitarian and patriarchal states cannot explain their achievements in promulgating and implementing women\u2019s rights nor does it allow us to even begin to understand where their \u201cwomen-friendly\u201d legislation and policies came from. In addition, in Asia, Latin America and Africa, the USA waged military and economic campaigns against (alleged) communism.","filename":"12783903_1566097193704259_1592729455_n","ext":".jpg","w":1080,"h":1350,"tn_w":200,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491335191966,"time":1491335191,"md5":"rg1oqj94BEQFwepj9jM+MQ==","fsize":127088,"resto":0,"id":"x6c+Q2RJ","country":"AR","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"mainstream-narratives-about-communism-in-europe","country_name":"Argentina","replies":11,"images":3,"unique_ips":9},{"no":119507311,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)15:47:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119507218\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119507218<\/a><br>who cares","time":1491335236,"resto":119507218,"id":"K\/RRurk6","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119507323,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)15:47:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"What happens to mainstream narratives about the history of communism if we go beyond the still common Eurocentric, androcentric and gender-blind focus and include questions about women and women\u2019s organizations, gender and \u201crace\u201d in this history; if we consider the many violent attempts to undermine communism; and if we explore the role of communists in European and global struggles against fascism, racism, colonialism and imperialism.

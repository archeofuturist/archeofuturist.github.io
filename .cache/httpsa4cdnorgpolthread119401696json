Their communities will die out as we liberal big city people use our superior education and intellect to make robots that take over their crappy jobs, and the working class white culture that voted for racism will be forever gone. All of their kids will have to come to the cities and be exposed to diversity and tolerance and see how much better it is that hate and bigotry that Trump represents. We will also grant citizenship to the tens of millions of undocumented immigrants, and allow more non-white people to come in, further solidifying a progressive diverse America that votes in universal healthcare, socialism and social justice policies that help everyone and dismantle white power structures that Trump supporters want to preserve.<br><br>This is the end of Trump&#039;s reign of terror, the beginning of freeing America from the grip of Russian control, and the beginning of a progressive America.","time":1491265656,"resto":119401696,"id":"YQLmrxzI","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119404575,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)20:27:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119404449\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119404449<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;leaf<\/span>","time":1491265666,"resto":119401696,"id":"YfSCsuZ6","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119404579,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)20:27:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119402337\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119402337<\/a><br><a href=\"#p119401969\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119401969<\/a>","filename":"221e3b9f32e98162e448a40cd076397fdcf7438bac8e7df1efb08b4ec7885a48","ext":".jpg","w":1600,"h":900,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1491265670405,"time":1491265670,"md5":"5IB\/BGIF6e2j7ahcKX++dg==","fsize":598709,"resto":119401696,"id":"4KbFDtBd","country":"KR","m_img":1,"country_name":"South Korea"},{"no":119404580,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)20:27:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119404449\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119404449<\/a><br>b u m p","time":1491265671,"resto":119401696,"id":"YcwoOAxk","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119404612,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)20:28:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119404467\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119404467<\/a><br>Don&#039;t repeal Hart Celler yet, my European wife will get deported back to be raped by muslims.","time":1491265687,"resto":119401696,"id":"dxuHFS0n","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119404615,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)20:28:07","name":"Anonymous","filename":"Literally the video that saved the USA","ext":".webm","w":700,"h":700,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491265687928,"time":1491265687,"md5":"dQPffHPwrCy7WkIRwovqqA==","fsize":2918061,"resto":119401696,"id":"bOztiyS7","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119404636,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)20:28:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119401696\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119401696<\/a><br>No. She.

On a national level, the head of state, the President, is elected indirectly by the people of each state, through an Electoral College. Today, the electors virtually always vote with the popular vote of their state. All members of the federal legislature, the Congress, are directly elected by the people of each state. There are many elected offices at state level, each state having at least an elective Governor and legislature. There are also elected offices at the local level, in counties, cities, towns, townships, boroughs, and villages.

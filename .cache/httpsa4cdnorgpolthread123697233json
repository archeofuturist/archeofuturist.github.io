Then, when we extended our search to other less controversial subjects, we found out that even subjects such as &quot;computing&quot;, get censored into showing &quot;people&quot; instead of &quot;men&quot;, while the search for &quot;women&quot; still gives gendered results. <br>We wanted to make sure it wasn&#039;t just about the GamerGate incident, so we tried mixing it with war, army and military subjects. While this time we did happen to have SOME men-gendered results (only when using quotation marks, mind you), it was an extremely low amount of results compared to a pushed narrative of &quot;people&quot; that were influential. Google even goes out of its way to give results that aren&#039;t even related to war so that they can plug &quot;people&quot; instead of &quot;men&quot; in the page results.<br>Let me share with you some pictures of our experiments, which we tried using the usual search method normies would use when researching a subject (typing words directly), trying to add quotation marks to make sure the word is in the title, and even going for an advanced search excluding the words &quot;people&quot; and &quot;women&quot;, but still getting the same retarded results.<br>How do you feel about the fact that your gender is officially now non-existent, and &quot;people&quot; fought in the world wars, not &quot;men&quot;, as SJWs effectively re-write history and eliminate toxic masculinity from it? I would talk about how this forces a narrative down people&#039;s throat, muh 1984, muh Farenheit 451, muh dystopian future, but you all know the drill and how dangerous censorship is, so well fuck it, no point in circle-jerking.","filename":"6e5138a20d37dd47f943cfa00a42956c771f81ae50aa655a491ed3a258154c7b","ext":".png","w":976,"h":1659,"tn_w":147,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493684487154,"time":1493684487,"md5":"A4WCssHBau9puGOLcoOgMA==","fsize":198854,"resto":0,"id":"Ge7DG9o0","country":"MK","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"google-now-censors-menrelated-searches","country_name":"Macedonia","replies":43,"images":11,"unique_ips":32},{"no":123697645,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)20:24:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123697233\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123697233<\/a><br>you have to go back<br>SAGE","time":1493684672,"resto":123697233,"id":"TYojquwx","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123697854,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)20:26:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123697233\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123697233<\/a><br><br>coulf it be possible that no one has ever titled their blog post &quot;most influential men video games&quot; because, you know, vidya isnt really manly<br><br>same goes for powerful people in the world, because onl the MSM ranks that shit and the MSM is where the bias lies","time":1493684781,"resto":123697233,"id":"CMREmS4p","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123698323,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)20:30:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"Just looked it up. &quot;most influential&quot; suggests &quot;women in history&quot;.<br>&quot;Most influential men&quot; suggests &quot;fashion blogs.&quot;","filename":"Screenshot_20170501-202809","ext":".png","w":1080,"h":1920,"tn_w":70,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493685024479,"time":1493685024,"md5":"vW7Bz3HN4L7culb3y7352A==","fsize":162105,"resto":123697233,"id":"WJitoRI2","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123698418,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)20:31:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123698323\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123698323<\/a><br>Shit","time":1493685069,"resto":123697233,"id":"WJitoRI2","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123699365,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)20:39:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"Imb4 phoneposter","filename":"Screenshot_20170502-023845","ext":".png","w":1080,"h":1920,"tn_w":70,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493685561743,"time":1493685561,"md5":"SPBTiNjqWB\/RbCabbjTFMQ==","fsize":143073,"resto":123697233,"id":"UVkV6N0p","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":123699557,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)20:41:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123699365\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123699365<\/a><br>Try searching &quot;famous white men&quot; and &quot;famous white women&quot;.

Basically 1950s amish people. Sounds fun to me.","filename":"1950s-dating","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":793,"tn_w":189,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490160317419,"time":1490160317,"md5":"dM3YCbANOUms2UxDjWl3ew==","fsize":62214,"resto":0,"id":"i3l+6hur","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"alright-hear-me-out-guys-we-buy-some-shit-piece","country_name":"United States","replies":22,"images":5,"unique_ips":13},{"no":117725179,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)01:26:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117725064\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117725064<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;nothing modern<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;implying no 4chan<\/span>","time":1490160391,"resto":117725064,"id":"qM\/3HOKt","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117725291,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)01:27:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;tfw I&#039;ll never get to take my best girl out to the malt shop on a Saturday night where all our school chums are hanging out.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;tfw I have no face.<\/span>","time":1490160466,"resto":117725064,"id":"y8GLK4eE","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117725425,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)01:29:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117725179\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117725179<\/a><br>we can get a building sized computer with tubes to stay connected","time":1490160554,"resto":117725064,"id":"i3l+6hur","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117725456,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)01:29:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117725064\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117725064<\/a><br><br>Use radios but no outside music?

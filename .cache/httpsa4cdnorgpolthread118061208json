One of the arguments in favor of the historicity of the Baptism of Jesus by John is the criterion of embarrassment, i.e. that it is a story which the early Christian Church would have never wanted to invent. Another argument used in favour of the historicity of the baptism is that multiple accounts refer to it, usually called the criterion of multiple attestation. Technically, multiple attestation does not guarantee authenticity, but only determines antiquity. However, for most scholars, together with the criterion of embarrassment it lends credibility to the baptism of Jesus by John being a historical event.","time":1490352900,"resto":118061208,"id":"2sp9Ch7P","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118069150,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)06:55:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118068659\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118068659<\/a><br>People making claims of deities are the ones with the burden of proof.

It clearly wasn&#039;t a significant factor, since while the Western Empire collapsed, the equally (or even more) Christian Eastern Empire continued for another 1000 years without collapsing and without any &quot;Dark Age&quot;.","time":1490353763,"resto":118061208,"id":"2sp9Ch7P","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118070112,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)07:09:42","name":"donald o&#039;brien","com":"lol nice bait thread <br>everyone knows pol is flooded by muslim goatfucking sandniggers","filename":"AAAA(2)","ext":".jpg","w":191,"h":264,"tn_w":90,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490353782411,"time":1490353782,"md5":"yktYKVra5N4HZ1NbgKIXuw==","fsize":12135,"resto":118061208,"id":"A6dXd2c5","country":"IL","country_name":"Israel"},{"no":118070171,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)07:10:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118069694\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118069694<\/a><br>But you are observing pagan european culture through the lens of your own christian european culture. Take your first point for example, no holy book. What if the pagan europeans didn&#039;t have a holy book, because they had no need for one? Perhaps it could have been so, that in their culture, the stories and myths about the gods, about creation, why humans exist, what ancient heroes did were passed on mouth-to mouth, and kept alive in wise old men and women who knew these stories. Is it not curious that these stories were not written down until Christianity came and superceded the old beliefs? Then right away we are, of course, faced with the question: How did these stories, myths and beliefs survive up until that point, if they were not written down? Could it be that when the Christians came, they forbid the telling of these stories, the worshipping of these gods and the recounting of the tales of these old heroes, so that the people for whom this mattered saw no other way of keeping the stories alive, than to write them down?","time":1490353841,"resto":118061208,"id":"Pdw9hFZ3","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":118070201,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)07:11:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118069979\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118069979<\/a><br> ^This.

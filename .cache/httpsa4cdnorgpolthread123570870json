Survival. It is by far the most important aspect of life. Staying alive. It is chiseled in our brains as the instinct of survival. Even before self-awareness came into play, it was this very instinct that drove us to keep searching for food, water and shelter. But when you are evolved enough to think about your life, you start to think about your ultimate death as well. That&#039;s when it might get a little complicated, because how can you cope with non-existance when your brain was wired to keep you alive? It is unthinkable. Unacceptable... For your lizard brain anyway. What to do? Then, centuries later, an idea comes. The idea that you can survive your own death. That death is only the gateway to another world, another life, another chance of just BEING, just staying alive. It maybe wishful thinking but you don&#039;t care because now, you have hope. Hope derived from that unshakeable feeling, this illogical certainty that you will survive your own death... Why does it fell good? Because then, your lizard brain is satisfied. Your survival instinct has done it&#039;s job. When you face death it will hang on to any thought of being able to stay alive. &quot;There are no atheists in foxholes&quot;. It is very true. In times of danger(such as war) your survival instinct dictates your thoughts. Even if it contradicts everything you stand for. Believing in the afterlife in these situations seems to make sense because it HAS to make sense. Your brain NEEDS it to be true in order to cope with anything else happening. It&#039;s the strongest need we have. It will drive you to do and think stuff you never thought was moral. Just to keep you alive or to maintain the illusion that you just might get through this.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;TL;DR<\/span><br>Most basic instinct=Survival<br>Religion says: you can survive your own death<br>Your lizard brain (as in instincts)= Sing me up!

Notice how Cassini is nuclear powered and how the satellite is being purposefully directed to crash into Saturn &quot;when it runs out of energy. How can anyone believe that nuclear energy can be used up so easily? Even within the span of two decades, that preposterous!<br><br>&quot;Bullshit, there isn&#039;t an alien civilization on Saturn! It&#039;s a gas giant for crying out loud!&quot;<br><br>Well, what if I told you that you were believing in lies the whole time? Yeah, Nasa and the European Space Agency has been spewing out false data and information regarding Saturn over the past several decades. Some of these lies went full on 1984 and ultimately resulted in rewritings of old historical records. Well, Saturn being a gas giant is just one of the many lies that have been spewed out.<br><br>\u25cf In true reality, Saturn&#039;s surface area is not that much larger than Earth&#039;s. Instead of the common ~16 billion square miles vs Earth&#039;s mere ~197 million square miles, Saturn is actually around ~204 million square miles.<br><br>\u25cf The rings are not natural. They are actually made up of at least tens of billions of small energy-harnessing drones. It&#039;s basically a quasi\/pseudo dyson sphere\/ring. They most likely collect solar energy.<br><br>Ttere&#039;s more points to be made, but the lies go really far. So for now, I&#039;m getting some sleep...","filename":"tmp_29659-download (62)1936557790","ext":".jpg","w":300,"h":168,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1493271361168,"time":1493271361,"md5":"L9bsgXDcyAxJsGOvVVpurA==","fsize":3829,"resto":0,"id":"DqL2\/krW","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"cassini-conspiracy-pt1","country_name":"United States","replies":6,"images":0,"unique_ips":7},{"no":123001215,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)01:40:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123000855\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123000855<\/a><br><br>kys earthling","time":1493271616,"resto":123000855,"id":"IlnlghUn","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123001430,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)01:42:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123000855\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123000855<\/a><br>Tell me about the hexagon poles","time":1493271779,"resto":123000855,"id":"b7awlR79","country":"CH","country_name":"Switzerland"},{"no":123001545,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)01:44:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"Bump","time":1493271876,"resto":123000855,"id":"4zWG7XvL","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123001602,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)01:45:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"Shhhhhh goyim...

Communism. &gt;250m and counting. <br><br>Be sure to study the Bolshevik revolution. Focus on how they respect religions. Study up on Pol Pot&#039;s decision to execute anyone with glasses because they were part of the Academic elite. Study up on how Stalin &amp; Trotsky executed 30m peasants, then stole grains \/ livestock &amp; salting their fields. <br><br>In every example, the Communist strategy is to force dependence on the State. Communism cannot exist within a self-sufficient populace. <br><br>Ask why the book Das Capital was never finished in Marx&#039;s lifetime. Answer: He could not effectively write about how to transition the government from the revolutionary stage to the classless stage. Marx spent the remaining years of his life pondering how to convince those in power to willingly give it up for true classlessness. In the end, even he discovered the folly of Communism; Absolute power corrupts absolutely.","time":1490900917,"resto":118952945,"id":"X1G7JJ1p","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118954476,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)15:10:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118952945\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118952945<\/a><br>Just say how communism is a pseudo religious cult that denies human nature.","time":1490901008,"resto":118952945,"id":"zsFMt0u3","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118954539,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)15:10:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118952945\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118952945<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;We&#039;ve all been asked to read the Communist Manifesto<\/span><br>wow I wonder why so many college aged students are fucking commies","time":1490901042,"resto":118952945,"id":"nx4qtUX7","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118954606,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)15:11:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118954318\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118954318<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Study up on Pol Pot&#039;s decision to execute anyone with glasses because they were part of the Academic elite<\/span><br>CIA puppet <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Study up on how Stalin &amp; Trotsky executed 30m peasants, then stole grains \/ livestock &amp; salting their fields.<\/span>","filename":"1490196679815","ext":".jpg","w":546,"h":640,"tn_w":106,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490901079409,"time":1490901079,"md5":"Bh8G0GTfGBbyKlookw\/ixA==","fsize":57122,"resto":118952945,"id":"A6dHNpks","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":118954731,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)15:12:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118952945\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118952945<\/a><br>Not the manifesto but still a letter to Marx","filename":"1490842550803","ext":".jpg","w":476,"h":829,"tn_w":71,"tn_h":124,"tim":1490901135871,"time":1490901135,"md5":"B6f7J9IRMkUwGocr\/A+0AQ==","fsize":62544,"resto":118952945,"id":"\/1N7QcDU","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118954907,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)15:13:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118954318\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118954318<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;That ok, wasnt real<\/span>","filename":"1490480448468","ext":".gif","w":800,"h":667,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":104,"tim":1490901227464,"time":1490901227,"md5":"m7DPtSpreCo2Mnx4n7VUWg==","fsize":1294489,"resto":118952945,"id":"Qa43enT6","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":118955191,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)15:16:28","name":"Anonymous","filename":"1490801114783","ext":".jpg","w":520,"h":489,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":117,"tim":1490901388330,"time":1490901388,"md5":"cLuNMgWZUUS+\/UWpAKtsog==","fsize":302090,"resto":118952945,"id":"Qa43enT6","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":118955259,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)15:17:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118952945\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118952945<\/a><br>I would suggest you cover up the &quot;Period of Stagnation&quot; and use that as an example of the effect that communism has on progress, mostly technological.<br>Because communism seeks to put out conflict in society, and destroy competition, it destroys progress.

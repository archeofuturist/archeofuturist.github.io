Referring to the culture of arranged marriages between cousins in the Muslim immigrant community, Woolas said: \u201cIf you have a child with your cousin the likelihood is there\u2019ll be a genetic problem.\u201d<br><br>Woolas, whose views are supported by medical experts, said most cases occur in immigrant families from rural Pakistan, where up to half of all marriages involve first cousins. Woolas said: \u201cIf you talk to any primary care worker they will tell you that levels of disability among the . . . Pakistani population are higher than the general population. And everybody knows it\u2019s caused by first cousin marriage.\u201d<br><br>The problem is made worse by generational inbreeding. As Woolas put it, \u201cMany of the parents themselves and many of the public spokespeople are themselves products of first cousin marriages.\u201d That would explain why research for BBC2\u2019s Newsnight in November 2005 showed that British Pakistanis accounted for 3.4% of all births but 30% of all British children with recessive genetic disorders.","filename":"1492349868826","ext":".png","w":420,"h":420,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493311098568,"time":1493311098,"md5":"KvEcjxrejHFEhYg2kf9XCw==","fsize":23708,"resto":0,"id":"Xf196zqT","country":"HR","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"half-of-worlds-muslims-are-inbred-due-to","country_name":"Croatia","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

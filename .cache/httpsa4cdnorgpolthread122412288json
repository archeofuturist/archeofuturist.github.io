This is the second state campaign chair for trump to be arrested on charges related to sex with minors. You faggots eat up their propaganda and then ignore reality. The GOP only releases propaganda against the democrats accusing them of stuff they themselves are guilty of. The second the pizzagate shit came out I knew they were hiding something. This goes much deeper than just a couple of campaign chairs. Trump himself is probably guilty. Remember we have multiple women who were willing to testify in court that Trump raped them when they were children.","filename":"Screenshot 2017-04-23 at 7.39.04 AM","ext":".png","w":1021,"h":872,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":106,"tim":1492948001874,"time":1492948001,"md5":"vSbPud0S3sIoa02t+n\/7kA==","fsize":549646,"resto":122412288,"id":"Q4mAiivs","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122414017,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)07:47:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122413964\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122413964<\/a><br>oops meant to make a new thread.

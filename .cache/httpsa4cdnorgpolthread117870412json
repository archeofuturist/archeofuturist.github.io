People on both sides of the gun debate admit handguns are the most common murder weapon in America, and if you count all the people who are shot but not killed (I&#039;ve heard the ratio of wounded to killed with handguns is about 6 to 1), then that means that a very large number of people are being shot with handguns.<br><br>I&#039;ve heard some arguments against this before, but none are especially convincing.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;criminals will still get guns<\/span><br>Some of them surely will, but if you stop the manufacture of new handguns and take the old ones off the street and melt them down, you can make it more difficult for criminals to get them.

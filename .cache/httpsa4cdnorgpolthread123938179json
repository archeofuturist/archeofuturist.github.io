A wonderfully crafted and carefully sourced restaurant where the service representatives are trained in the highest levels of customer enjoyment.<br>Napkins consistently folded and clean butterscotch wood colored tabled shined to perfection food served hot with dynamic array of flavors diversity welcome! All manners of diners accepted they will serve you wine prior to 3:00pm<br><br>I choose Ruby Tuesdays because I believe in community involvement and restaurants that will give back locally. Simple, fresh American dining is an investment in my community.<br>I love Ruby Tuesdays and I want you to love it too! Euros keep out if you don&#039;t like it!","filename":"IMG_3482","ext":".jpg","w":550,"h":412,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1493833700544,"time":1493833700,"md5":"WLVE1N+fbfmS4TPqV98mFA==","fsize":48299,"resto":0,"id":"niOrM+3G","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"euromediterranean-cultures-mocking-american","country_name":"United States","replies":8,"images":2,"unique_ips":6},{"no":123938510,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)13:51:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123938179\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123938179<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;American classics<\/span><br>That&#039;s the thing, your shit are in no way clasics.<br>Come back when you have at least a millenia of culture to look back on.","time":1493833878,"resto":123938179,"id":"CgFtdiPR","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":123938550,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)13:51:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123938179\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123938179<\/a><br>Holy shit this is the worst attempt at viral marketing I&#039;ve seen in a while.

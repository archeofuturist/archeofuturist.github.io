He quickly ran to his favorite window (his only window) in his 10x7 foot apartment in Bangalangalololololoarashabad, stood on a plastic crate he found floating in the river, and shoved his rear end out the window. Hardly before his sequined pink pants cleared the way, his hairless cheeks parted and jettisoned the leftovers of his mothers saag paneer out onto the street, scalding a 45lb starving 14 year old urchin and desecrating a statue of an effeminate man with a lion face and 8 arms. Ranjeep sighed, and wiped the excess feces from his anus and cleaned his hand with a quick wipe on the inside of the window pane. &quot;Good enough&quot;, he thought.

He knew exactly how to calm himself down, and that was with a good ol gang rape. He closed his 2004 era dell laptop and went downstairs, and raped a 9 year old in full view of his parents. Luckily Ranjeep threw down a handful of dry lentils, so they were distracted and ultimately indebted to him.<\/span>","time":1493483829,"resto":123346562,"id":"4nZnaU0r","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123350826,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)12:39:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123346562\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123346562<\/a><br>SPECIFICALLY CHOSEN BODILY WASTE REMOVAL STREETS","time":1493483979,"resto":123346562,"id":"xCES6Dn4","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123350855,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)12:39:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123350485\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123350485<\/a><br>for all intents and purposes, you are a greasy 40-year old black guy from South Sudan using a VPN<br><br>timestamped tits or gtfo","time":1493483999,"resto":123346562,"id":"HlL9iWKM","country":"IN","country_name":"India"},{"no":123350958,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)12:40:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Be pajeet<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Need to take a shit<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Quickly worship the toilet UN installed in time shack that I built a temple on<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Proceed to designated shitting street two houses down<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;There&#039;s already I cow there<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Shit<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Spend 15 minutes worshiping its sacred feces<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Move on to next shitting street<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Get gang raped on the way<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Shit all over the rapist&#039;s dicks<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;All better now<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Return home to tin shack<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Commence SUPERPOWER BY 2020 posting<\/span>","time":1493484059,"resto":123346562,"id":"kW03nJhc","country":"LV","country_name":"Latvia"},{"no":123351070,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)12:42:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Pajeet trying to appeal to a bunch of white supremacists by stimulating the part of their brain that hates the muzzies, non-ironicly thinking they are that stupid.<\/span><br>Good one.","time":1493484145,"resto":123346562,"id":"FLoQzETc","country":"MA","country_name":"Morocco"},{"no":123351081,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)12:42:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123350485\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123350485<\/a><br>But on a more serious note, you do realize that not all people of Hindu roots are sexually backwards, right?

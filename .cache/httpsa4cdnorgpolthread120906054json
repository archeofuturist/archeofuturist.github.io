When the bull class has been prepped, there will be time for wife to get mounted by the bull, and eventually the functions of the husband will become indistinguishable from the functions of a porn shot fluffer, and his genitalia will &#039;wither away&#039; as Marx said.<\/span><br><br>I don&#039;t have any websites but i&#039;m pretty sure OP can help me with that.","time":1492092680,"resto":120906054,"id":"OckUqXr4","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120913550,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)10:12:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120913254\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120913254<\/a><br>when was the last time you fought ISIS roach? <br><br>Oh no thats right you just buy their oil.

Socialism has been tried and suceeded in many places. Revolutionary Catalonia being one of those places, where agricultural yields were increased by up to 50% according to some sources.<br><br> Similar, in Honduras, where rural campesinos have recently reclaimed land back from corrupt politicians and drug lords, the collective farms have seen massive increase in yields. <br><br> This is but one example of the success of communist ideologies. <br><br> While I do not support the USSR or the its systems, i do understand its place in history and why many in Russia felt the need for such a revolution. I have similar feelings towards places like Cuba. While Castro has his faults, his is infinitely better than Batista was. Similarly, Lenin turned Russia from a backwards peasant nation into an industrial superpower almost over night. While I believe firmly in Libertarian Socialism and direct democracy, that achievement is something that cannot be overlooked. Considering they had a king before, is a peoples dictator not a step forward?<br><br> I&#039;m talking about Lenin BTW, pretty much all after him were garbage, but this is the problem with democratic centralism and leninism, which anarchist communism seeks to resolve by direct democracy.","time":1492093107,"resto":120906054,"id":"6kJwal26","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120914449,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)10:20:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120913947\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120913947<\/a><br>Anarchist Communist as I have stated. <br><br><a href=\"#p120914001\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120914001<\/a><br>But everyone cares what you think.... and thats why Trump is still gonna build the wall...<br><br>No wait he isn&#039;t. <br><br>and thats why hes not going to carry out military interventions in the middle east....<br><br>oh wait but he is...<br><br>and that&#039;s why hes gonna drain the swap..<br><br>but he didn&#039;t and now is more full of jewry than ever. <br><br>I know full well nobody listens to me or you, the proletariat.

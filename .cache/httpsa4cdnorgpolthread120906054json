Nestor Mahkno was famous for beginning to implement this arrangement in Ukraine, it may seem Utopian and unbelievable but by the fall of his territory to the USSR production in some areas worked by completely free exchange, that is, workers in one place simply agreed that they would make enough of the product for the workers in the other industries and vice versa, they were unified in their goal of a territory free from the USSR and from capitalism and were willing to work together in mutual aid for that.<br><br> So in some theories it is gradually phased out, in some theories it is replaced by labour vouchers (i don&#039;t really like this theory, kinda just money by a different name) and in some theories it is instantly replaced with a system of free exchange, this last one is technically pure Anarchist Communism.

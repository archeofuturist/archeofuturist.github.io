Most of the &quot;Red Heart&quot; of America is totally fucking empty. The people who&#039;ve chosen to live in territory where it&#039;s one guy per mile are probably so anti-social that they&#039;re of no help at all. You have way more territory than the urban centers can hold, but most of it isn&#039;t doing any damned thing at all. It probably only takes a couple of x-box jockeys and their drones to shut down the only town for 60 miles.Also, the modern American economy is dependent on a system where the rural and the urban work together. If you posit a civil war then on the one hand the cities lose access to most of the factories and pretty much all of the raw materials. But on the other hand, the mines and factories in the rural areas are designed to trade like clockwork across the country and the world by using the highways and ports of the united states. <br>So on the one hand the people in the cities are quickly running out of food. On the other hand, the factories of the rural lands are running short on raw materials because A: without the cities or port trade for customers, no one is buying their product so they don&#039;t have the money to import more raw materials even from each other. And B: you can&#039;t drive a fleet of semi trucks down country road 7 in the middle of the goddamn night. Distributed manufacturing means you NEED the us highway system to hold everything together, and that system runs straight through the cities. <br>One wildcard here is the big H. Rural people are super addicted to heroin and meth, and while they can make meth for a while out of what should be medical supplies, heroin is shipped across the border to get here. If you thought the urban niggening was bad, you haven&#039;t watched every meth-head in your town simultaneously chimping out because their drug dealer can&#039;t get in his next shipment. <br>As individuals, the red-tribe probably do better, but whatever formal government was representing them probably does worse.","filename":"usa-population-density-map-flat","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":477,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":99,"tim":1493545423600,"time":1493545423,"md5":"Hy\/wwRos6EksuPsiuARf7w==","fsize":72978,"resto":123452467,"id":"\/DlXpvxd","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123461682,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)05:43:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123461384\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123461384<\/a><br>Exactly.

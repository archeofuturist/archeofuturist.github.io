Government is not the source of morality, and people with similar morals with tend to group together. For example, communities with the best safety standards are safe because their members agree that killing and stealing is bad, they have high moral standards, not because there&#039;s a law agaist it. In the same way that whole cities with the highest crime rate are bad because their members have low morals and agree that stealing and killing are acceptable forms of enrichment, despite a law existing against it.","time":1490724692,"resto":118669369,"id":"VWDv7U+M","country":"CR","country_name":"Costa Rica"},{"no":118676476,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)14:12:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118673864\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118673864<\/a><br>Saved, doing God&#039;s work anon.","filename":"autistic screeching marx","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":473,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":118,"tim":1490724726668,"time":1490724726,"md5":"r+R1HDIdRAW8ZuoTy8O4sw==","fsize":152093,"resto":118669369,"id":"s\/NCoaNN","country":"SK","country_name":"Slovakia"},{"no":118676550,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)14:12:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"For the ones on here that want a dictator to clean out the commies before establishing a stateless ancap society.<br>Wont you fall into the same trap that Leninists and Maoists fall into when the dictator promises to step down but never does","time":1490724771,"resto":118669369,"id":"tEhGH12x","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118676560,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)14:12:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;this thread<\/span><br><br>Top cringe.","filename":"1490680120288","ext":".png","w":600,"h":377,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":78,"tim":1490724774214,"time":1490724774,"md5":"hRch28jTgQXcrCfmAKqfMQ==","fsize":90849,"resto":118669369,"id":"mTdqFvGk","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118676642,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)14:13:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118676227\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118676227<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;buying all the property in the world is bad<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;not letting people enter your property is bad<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;not letting people to carry guns in your property is bad<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;not letting me pay for degeneracy with your rent money<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;not an argument<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Not letting me choose who lives in my property<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Not letting me enforce extreme rules on my property.<\/span>","time":1490724807,"resto":118669369,"id":"uTRIXyIs","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118676717,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)14:13:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118676256\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118676256<\/a><br>But your whole point can be applied to anything (government system) such as, that goes on even today in our &quot;democratic&quot; society.","time":1490724838,"resto":118669369,"id":"o4MimyvF","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118676767,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)14:14:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118676418\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118676418<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Government is not the source of morality<\/span><br><br>Of course not.

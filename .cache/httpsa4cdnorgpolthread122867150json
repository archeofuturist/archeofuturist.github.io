Here is what he told me.<br><br>The end-times Tribulation is only some days away. It hasn&#039;t started yet, in spite of the ongoing global conflict.<br><br>He is mortal as of right now. He lives among us, but nobody knows he is the Messiah. He returned to earth by being born as a human.<br><br>Here is his story.<br>He did not know he was the Messiah when he was born. He was a sinner, and the older he got the more he sinned. As he grew up his life became increasingly anguished and eventually everyone turned against him. He was protected by God during this process.<br><br>He eventually risked being killed or subverted. At this point he unilaterally made the choice to fully repent. He made this choice entirely of his own volition, and he never committed sins from then on.<br><br>After he repented, it was revealed to him that he was the Messiah, among other things.<br><br><br>After some time passed, the Tribulation process intensified. The precursors are earthquakes, floods, diseases, terrorism and others. This included, among other things, the Orlando shooting, the Syrian chemical attack, the earthquakes in Oklahoma, the wildfires in Florida and the Bluecut fire, suicide attacks by the Islamic State, and the unrest and threat of famine in Venezuela.","filename":"rays","ext":".jpg","w":4096,"h":3348,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":204,"tim":1493200696084,"time":1493200696,"md5":"jmCzOl7DUnLfNzr7R7P75w==","fsize":662525,"resto":0,"id":"8OPR13ZV","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-second-coming","trip":"!!zGdvulc9uzC","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":1},{"no":122867176,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)05:58:42","com":"The Messiah told me the Tribulation isn&#039;t years away anymore, it&#039;s on the order of days away. It will be marked by World War 3. It is inevitable, not even the Messiah can stop it.<br><br>He told me he wants to prevent the suffering in it. Although he fears God, he fights him in attempt to prevent the persecution. Being the Messiah, he is the only person who has any control over what happens.<br><br>He currently lives in poor living conditions. He has no time to maintain a career while performing his responsibility. He&#039;s the only person with the power to mitigate the tribulation, and he is actively fighting God for this.<br><br>He is also completely vulnerable. He will be in the middle of World War 3 when it starts. His country will be nuked during nuclear warfare. He isn&#039;t guaranteed God&#039;s protection since he is opposing his plan.<br><br>That&#039;s why I was commissioned to ask for help. He needs a fortress to make it through World War 3 and carry out his work and it&#039;s going to start in only days, but he needs money for the property and the resources. Without this, there is a high probability he will die and God will proceed with the Tribulation unhindered and destroy nearly all of humankind just as planned.<br><br>Therefore I must ask you, \/pol\/, for money for his fortress, so he can prevent some of these prophesies. He told me he will repay anyone who gives money many-fold (over ten-fold). Not much is needed. The payment must be done anonymously for his privacy, however, via whatever means. Every bit will help.","time":1493200722,"resto":122867150,"id":"8OPR13ZV","country":"US","trip":"!!zGdvulc9uzC","country_name":"United States"}]}

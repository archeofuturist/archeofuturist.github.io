Moreover, Fascism, striving to make human society coincide with the Cosmic Order and the Truth, does not favor obscurification of one&#039;s Personhood, but to the contrary wants to develop it to its full potential, which is different for every man, based on their place within the Cosmic Order. Our goal, in short, is creating the Organic State, where everyone is in their rightful place, striving to realize themselves and in doing so contribute to the realization of the nation, the race, and of the ultimate Truth. <br><br>This goal can only be achieved with a special kind of social structure, one that does not permit for the individualist free for all, nor the collectivist clan\/class\/group conflicts. That structure is Socialism as Social Order. This is not economic socialism, but Socialism that exists on par with and in opposition to Individualism and Collectivism, by placing upon the people a sense of Duty, which removes the element of interest inherent to these two social structures, defining them as qualitatively the same, and placing our Socialism as qualitatively different (exactly it&#039;s inappropriate to talk about any kind of &quot;third paths&quot; when in practice there are only two). Socialism as Social Order likewise undermines, through its introduction of Duty, the fundamental premise of both Capitalism and Communism, who seek the same ends by different means, whereas our Socialism disregards those ends and likewise burdens economics with the same Duty that it burdens the people in the social structure.<br><br>This Socialism had a variety of names to help distinguish it from economic socialism: Authoritarian\/Prussian\/German Socialism as opposed to English socialism (Oswald Spengler), or just the Socialism of National-Socialism.","filename":"6f5","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":600,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493777809839,"time":1493777809,"md5":"T3Nwr7cPVFy+SFcuX0A3gw==","fsize":43898,"resto":123847352,"id":"emJ\/s7DJ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123856921,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)22:16:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123856642\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123856642<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;i can create classless societies and somehow avoid new classes forming above the working class<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;i can pit members of the national community together, sow division and hatred between kin and somehow still claim to be a nationalist<\/span><br><br>Judeo-Bolshevist traitor please leave","time":1493777814,"resto":123847352,"id":"LVsy2T0K","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123856997,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)22:17:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123856757\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123856757<\/a><br>Only Americans seem to get hung up on this word.

It&#039;s not anti-capitalistic, just understanding the flaws of the free market. Capitalism aims to reward the best man with the most reward. The free market theoretically allows that, but in practice also allows significant amounts of abuse that are used in practice to prevent all competition and completely annihilate the value of quality, such that whoever has the loudest voice wins, and whoever is biggest has the loudest voice, regardless of any and all other parameters, despite the fact that voice volume is completely uncorrelated (often anti-correlated, even) with value.<br><br>The fact is, severe regulations are needed to prevent such effects. It&#039;s the same as how CEOs now can make over 10k times as much for a salary as their next highest-paid staff, whereas it was closer to 100x before. When the gap is so high, the value of money is extremely skewed (yes there are XY bills in circulation, but only 0.1XY may be actually viable, thus an inflation rate of X fucks over 90% of people).<br><br>Another effect that can be seen is the current mushroom-startups epidemic. People make startups that are literally designed to not be viable, because it&#039;s impossible to compete with the big guys in any way. However, it is possible to get bought by the big guys. How? Instead of creating value over a long period of time and becoming self-sustaining, just use up all your resources to scream as loud as possible for a few seconds. Congrats, you now have a multimillion payout for yourself and several hundred grands for each of your employees.<br><br>There&#039;s no competition here. You can&#039;t fault a lone ant for not being able to fight a rhinoceros. Meanwhile, you can&#039;t fault all the ants in the world for not being able to move mountains. The only option is to reform the law to close loophole, and enact severe constraint on the free market.

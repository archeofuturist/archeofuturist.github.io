She was then subpoenaed but denied under oath that Clinton had raped her, in order, she later said[by whom?], to protect her privacy, her husband and her horse-farm business. During the Clinton impeachment proceedings, Broaddrick changed course and publicly alleged the President had raped her to ABC news.<\/span><br><br>Sounds dubious as fuck to me.

Thus, if Earth was originally a ball of fire and molten metal, some of this fire remained in its centre, while centrifugal force as a result of its rotation on its axis caused its solid matter to be thrown toward the surface, forming a solid crust and leaving its interior hollow, with a fiery ball in its centre, forming the central sun, which provides illumination for plant, animal and human life.","filename":"astronaut","ext":".jpg","w":1331,"h":1024,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":96,"tim":1490535433639,"time":1490535433,"md5":"tLjlxebt5H\/KwnFCDnopIA==","fsize":177664,"resto":118358644,"id":"Nu3u2oir","country":"AU","m_img":1,"country_name":"Australia"},{"no":118362125,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)09:38:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118361791\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118361791<\/a><br><a href=\"#p118361840\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118361840<\/a><br><a href=\"#p118361926\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118361926<\/a><br>You need a tourism permit and that area is miles in land farther than where tourism companies go.<br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Touri<wbr>sm_in_Antarctica#Landing_in_Antarct<wbr>ica","time":1490535482,"resto":118358644,"id":"jrZcmcg8","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118362190,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)09:38:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118359275\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118359275<\/a><br><br>Go home Ebrietas, you ARE drunk","time":1490535526,"resto":118358644,"id":"UovDbKlO","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":118362296,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)09:40:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118361266\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118361266<\/a><br>I probably brake at least 1 law a day.

According to Plato, it was destroyed 9,000 years before the time of Solon, or around 9,600 BC. This date is interesting for a number of reasons, seminally because this is the date given by archaeologists to the abandonment of Gobleki Tepi, which was built around 11,500 BC. Gobleki Tepi was a sort of &quot;ark&quot; (like the biblical ark), though it was of course stationary, and consisted of a series of long tunnels and underground chambers, in which were stored the seeds of the possibilities of the future cycle (at that time, the Bronze Age or Dvapara Yuga which would follow the destruction of Atlantis). The Zoroastrian Avesta contains an intriguing account of this, which Graham Hancock has linked to Gobleki Tepi. Basically, Atlantean civilization was destroyed by a great flood, and a period of global cooling. A great crystal displacement occurred during this time, which shifted Atlantis from its seat in the middle of the Atlantic south toward its present location in the Antarctic. There it became covered with ice. Survivors from Atlantis who anticipated its destruction went out in all directions from the middle of the Atlantic to spread their sacred knowledge : west to the Americas, east to Egypt, Mesopotamia, Ireland, and elsewhere. Ancient myths of diverse traditions (Thoth and the Seven Sages in Egypt, the Tuatha DeDanaan of Ireland, etc.) recount this transmission of ancient knowledge. <br><br>Now, the ancient concept of the Great Year will help us give context to the fall of Atlantis. A Great Year, according to Plato, was 25,800 years - the time it takes for one full axial procession, one cycle of the equinoxes. Some esotericists have linked this to the Hindu doctrine of the Yugas and the Manvantara, with obvious parallels in Hesiod&#039;s conception of the four ages and the traditions existing among against Nordic peoples, and the Mayans, of course. The unifying theme is...","time":1490536810,"resto":118358644,"id":"W3QLwJyh","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118364493,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)10:05:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118364023\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118364023<\/a><br><br>I completely agree with you that Antarctica is Atlantis. Remember that Plato said that Atlantis was larger than Asia Minor (present-day Turkey) and Libya (which in those days referred to Northern Africa minus Egypt) combined. Antarctica is larger than Asia Minor and Libya combined. Read up on Charles Hapgood&#039;s theory of crustal displacement and keep in mind that Charles Hapgood died suddenly in (((suspicious circumstances))). Antarctica (Atlantis in those days) used to be near the equator and thus had a tropical climate. Also, Plato said that there were elephants and bananas in Atlantis. Elephants and bananas naturally exist ONLY in tropical climates. Crustal displacement made Atlantis slide southward to its present position. Also, I&#039;m interested in the cyclical conception of human history that pre-Abrahamic cultures had. The Ancient Greeks had a cyclical conception of human history that was similar to the cyclical conception of human history that the Hindus had (and STILL have). The Ancient Greeks had a Golden Age (equivalent to Satya Yuga in Hinduism), a Silver Age (equivalent to Treta Yuga in Hinduism), a Bronze Age (equivalent to Dwapara Yuga in Hinduism) and an Iron Age (equivalent to Kali Yuga in Hinduism). I call the model of human history that is currently dominant among historians &#039;the linear-progressive model of human history&#039;. The linear-progressive model of human history basically says that the further back in human history you go, the more primitive that humans, their cultures and their technology becomes. The linear-progressive model of human history embraced by modern historians and modern anthropologists actually has its roots in Judeo-Christian beliefs, ironically enough.","time":1490537105,"resto":118358644,"id":"Nu3u2oir","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":118364592,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)10:05:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118364493\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118364493<\/a><br><br>Virtually EVERY pre-Abrahamic culture WORLDWIDE embraced a conception of human history that was CYCLICAL, with civilisations rising and falling one after the other over VAST periods of time and humans being EXTREMELY OLD.

We can speak of circular time, and indeed in sacred geometry we hear of the &quot;solidifying of the world,&quot; of a movement from sphere, which contains in itself all possible forms, to square which by necessity cannot. Of relevance is the geometry of the flood story in Genesis. The ark may be represented as a parabola (y=x^2), and the rainbow which was placed in the heavens of course is its inverse, with the vertex shifted upward, and with the parabola extending downward. Thus these two forms taken together form a sphere, which as we hinted in the previous post, is linked to the concept of the World Egg and also the Omphalos, as indicative of that which contains the seeds of the possibilities of the next cycle.","time":1490537161,"resto":118358644,"id":"W3QLwJyh","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118364720,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)10:07:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118364592\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118364592<\/a><br><br>Also, Egypt was not the only place that had myths about seven sages.

In Idaho, for example, a 2-million-year-old clay figurine was unearthed in 1912. But even this discovery does not mark an outer limit. Bones, vertebrae and even complete skeletons have been found in Italy, Argentina and Kenya. Their minimum datings range from 3 million to 4 million years. A human skull, a partial human skeleton and a collection of neoliths discovered in California have been dated in excess of 5 million years. A human skeleton discovered at Midi in France, paleoliths found in Portugal, Burma and Argentina, a carved bone and flint flakes from Turkey all have a minimum age of 5 million years.<br>How far back can human history be pushed with discoveries like these? The answer seems to be a great deal further than orthodox science currently allows. As if the foregoing discoveries were not enough, we need to take account of:<br>* Paleoliths from France dated between 7 and 9 million years<br>* An eolith from India with a minimum dating of 9 million years<br>* Incised bones from France, Argentina and Kenya no less than 12 million years old<br>* More paleolith discoveries from France, dated at least 20 million years ago<br>* Neoliths from California in excess of 23 million years<br>* Three different kinds of paleoliths from Belgium with a minimum dating of 26 million years<br>* An anatomically modern human skeleton, neoliths and carved stones found at the Table Mountain, California and dated at least 33 million years ago<br>But even 33 million years is not the upper limit. A human skeleton found in Switzerland is estimated to be between 38 and 45 million years old. France has yielded up eoliths, paleoliths, cut wood and a chalk ball, the minimum ages of which range from 45 to 50 million years.<br>There&#039;s still more.","time":1490537880,"resto":118358644,"id":"Nu3u2oir","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":118365685,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)10:18:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118365652\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118365652<\/a><br><br>(start of part 3) In 1960, H. L. Armstrong announced in Nature magazine the discovery of fossil human footprints near the Paluxy River, in Texas. Dinosaur footprints were found in the same strata. In 1983, the Moscow News reported the discovery of a fossilised human footprint next to the fossil footprint of a three-toed dinosaur in the Turkamen Republic. Dinosaurs have been extinct for approximately 65 million years.<br>In 1983, Professor W. G. Burroughs of Kentucky reported the discovery of three pairs of fossil tracks dated to 300 million years ago. They showed left and right footprints. Each print had five toes and a distinct arch. The toes were spread apart like those of a human used to walking barefoot. The foot curved back like a human foot to what appeared to be a human heel. There was a pair of prints in the series that showed a left and right foot. The distance between them is just what you&#039;d expect in modern human footprints.<br>In December 1862, The Geologist carried news of a human skeleton found 27.5 m (90 ft) below the surface in a coal seam in Illinois. The seam was dated between 286 and 320 million years. It&#039;s true that a few eoliths, skull fragments and fossil footprints, however old, provide no real backing for the idea of advanced prehistoric human civilisations.<br>But some other discoveries do.<br>In 1968, an American fossil collector named William J. Meister found a fossilised human shoe print near Antelope Spring, Utah. There were trilobite fossils in the same stone, which means it was at least 245 million years old. Close examination showed that the sole of this shoe differed little, if at all, from those of shoes manufactured today.<br>In 1897, a carved stone showing multiple faces of an old man was found at a depth of 40 m (130 ft) in a coal mine in Iowa.

Frank J. Kenwood, who made the discovery, was so intrigued he traced the origin of the coal and discovered it came from the Wilburton Mine in Oklahoma. The coal there is about 312 million years old.<br>In 1844, Scottish physicist Sir David Brewster reported the discovery of a metal nail embedded in a sandstone block from a quarry in the north of England. The head was completely encased, ruling out the possibility that it had been driven in at some recent date. The block from which it came is approximately 360 million years old.<br>On 22 June 1844, The Times reported that a length of gold thread had been found by workmen embedded in stone close to the River Tweed. This stone too was around 360 million years old.<br>Astonishing though these dates may appear to anyone familiar with the orthodox theory of human origins, they pale in comparison with the dates of two further discoveries.<br>According to Scientific American, dated 5 June 1852, blasting activities at Meeting House Hill, in Dorchester, Massachusetts, unearthed a metallic, bell-shaped vessel extensively decorated with silver inlays of flowers and vines. The workmanship was described as &#039;exquisite&#039;. The vessel was blown out of a bed of Roxbury conglomerate dated somewhat earlier than 600 million years.<br>In 1993, Michael A. Cremo and Richard L. Thompson reported the discovery &#039;over the past several decades&#039; of hundreds of metallic spheres in a pyrophyllite mine in South Africa. The spheres are grooved and give the appearance of having been manufactured.

It&#039;s a polar symbol. Try to find the unifying element in all the different representations of this symbol. We have in each of them a sort of nucleus, about which arms extend in a circular pattern. Rene Guenon was right to point out something of great interest here - that the arms of the swastika appear to indicate movement about the axis, centripetal movement. This is a very important symbol in sacred geometry. The &quot;nucleus&quot; of the swastika is linked to notions of a world center - Shamballah, Agartha, The Celestial Paradise (or the terrestrial paradise, which is its reflection). From this spiritual center, manifestation takes place in concentric rings toward the outer limit of the swastika. Thus we have here a movement from the spiritual and immaterial to the solidified, the material. This can also be understood as the result of the union of Shiva (masculine, spirit, Yang) with Shakti (feminine, material, Yin). When unified, an approximation of the primordial hermaphrodite is achieved. A helpful analogy is that Shiva is the sun who &quot;inseminates&quot; the plant, Shakti, allowing it to grow.","time":1490537932,"resto":118358644,"id":"W3QLwJyh","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118365763,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)10:19:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118364852\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118364852<\/a><br>http:\/\/www.giza-legacy.ch\/prehistor<wbr>ical-history\/<br>http:\/\/www.esotericonline.net\/group<wbr>\/egypt\/forum\/topics\/historic-rise-o<wbr>f-the-land-of","filename":"1482590093371","ext":".png","w":760,"h":1815,"tn_w":52,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490537952241,"time":1490537952,"md5":"upWIXaxvLWfDlJ+NZ7gvew==","fsize":1386936,"resto":118358644,"id":"4\/5Ttu9P","country":"DE","m_img":1,"country_name":"Germany"},{"no":118365794,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)10:19:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118365713\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118365713<\/a><br><br>(start of part 5) What are we to make of these perplexing discoveries?

Then Syria can be divided, as has been the plan, giving Kurdistan its own country.","filename":"4D chess moves","ext":".jpg","w":460,"h":672,"tn_w":85,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491594166325,"time":1491594166,"md5":"AIWYRIsO2Fh4Dj1nyTJm+Q==","fsize":40914,"resto":120007903,"id":"ppj1jDAF","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120010474,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)15:44:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120007903\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120007903<\/a><br>we need to support a the_donald takeover.","time":1491594250,"resto":120007903,"id":"nMiHFdm4","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120010647,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)15:45:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120007903\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120007903<\/a><br>Hi, The_Donald.<br>Trump is a massive faggot, who would get my vote (if I were a US citizen) just for the fact that he won&#039;t play world police, will stay away from Assad and help him fight ISIS, just like he promised.

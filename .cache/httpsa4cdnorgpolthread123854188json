That\u2019s on Paul Ryan as much as it\u2019s on Trump, but Trump certainly didn\u2019t help. He checked out at the wheel and Democrats and the Freedom Caucus controlled the messaging war and shut it down. It was a colossal failure for the Republicans.<br><br>His budget has been mocked and derided by even Republicans, and just recently the Democrats led by Pelosi and Schumer outfoxed Trump and many conservative Republicans by cutting a deal with the moderate Republicans and managing to actually get funding for things like Planned Parenthood, NASA, PBS, NPR, and limit the EPA cuts from 30% to 1%. The alternative was to shut down the government. That\u2019s right, the majority party which controls all branches of government would have been forced to shut down the government because they can\u2019t lead.<br><br>He\u2019s not the negotiator he claimed he was. How anyone could have tricked themselves into thinking he was I don\u2019t know. He\u2019s a man who inherited his money, and his book, the Art of the Deal, is rife with bullying tactics and business thuggery. Hot and cold might work on the business scene (and maybe not given how many bankruptcies he\u2019s had) but politics requires nuance, and Trump has none of that.","filename":"DRUMPF","ext":".jpg","w":350,"h":350,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493776474965,"time":1493776474,"md5":"GDuBNYMMSwATeujoE2ajNA==","fsize":32796,"resto":123854188,"id":"BHGVnzEr","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123854336,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)21:54:36","name":"Anonymous","filename":"1463530068509","ext":".png","w":612,"h":410,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1493776476132,"time":1493776476,"md5":"2ODDTzo5fgtNtZatBB7h\/g==","fsize":308009,"resto":123854188,"id":"FiuRhoy6","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123854370,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)21:54:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123854188\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123854188<\/a>","filename":"1489460961618","ext":".jpg","w":1324,"h":1308,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":123,"tim":1493776490663,"time":1493776490,"md5":"7kfhAIj97sBZVsy\/95nwYg==","fsize":519674,"resto":123854188,"id":"jPimy6HB","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":123854381,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)21:54:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123854334\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123854334<\/a><br>diot has been delivered to him, and President Xi basically changed Trump\u2019s mind on foreign policy in a 10 minute conversation.

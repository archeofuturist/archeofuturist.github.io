I mean I don&#039;t wanna fuck up and not go to heaven.&quot;[45] In an answer to a question about Judas Priest having an overt homosexual image, &quot;I don&#039;t wanna talk about this. The last thing I need is a bunch of homos picketing us.&quot;[45] In 2012, on KIRO-FM he was asked if he supports gay marriage and replied: &quot;Well, since I&#039;m not gay, the answer to that would be no.&quot;[46][47] He was then asked if he would support legislation to make gay marriage legal and said, &quot;I&#039;m Christian. The answer to that would be no.&quot;<\/span>","filename":"Felices-Mustaine-Megadeth-Ellefson-Bertozzi_LNCIMA20131023_0022_13","ext":".jpg","w":387,"h":276,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":89,"tim":1493761285670,"time":1493761285,"md5":"TgCfDqE0hGz7rXP+VARhZw==","fsize":19322,"resto":123801851,"id":"xpDi7Clh","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123824197,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)17:44:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123821063\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123821063<\/a><br>underrated post","time":1493761480,"resto":123801851,"id":"20QZI8J9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123824758,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)17:48:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"ZAPPA<br>A<br>P<br>P<br>A","time":1493761711,"resto":123801851,"id":"4LWskk9\/","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123824798,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)17:48:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123803592\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123803592<\/a><br>I love Johnny Rebel!","time":1493761726,"resto":123801851,"id":"TwHEtJ6r","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123826430,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)18:00:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123823786\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123823786<\/a><br>He would literally suck Lars and James off daily to be back in Metallica tho","time":1493762433,"resto":123801851,"id":"OmBWCn3b","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123826546,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)18:01:25","name":"Anonymous","filename":"elvis_nixon","ext":".jpg","w":634,"h":456,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":89,"tim":1493762485416,"time":1493762485,"md5":"DbRbfPW4GIauo1jOpWrDZQ==","fsize":76850,"resto":123801851,"id":"Idv6ooi2","country":"RS","country_name":"Serbia"},{"no":123826777,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)18:03:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123826430\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123826430<\/a><br>He respects Metallica a lot, that&#039;s not dickriding","time":1493762584,"resto":123801851,"id":"xpDi7Clh","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123827573,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)18:09:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123811993\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123811993<\/a><br>F","time":1493762945,"resto":123801851,"id":"8NaGRxBo","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123828505,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)18:16:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123812093\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123812093<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;story of the year<\/span><br>shit I haven&#039;t listened to them in years","time":1493763389,"resto":123801851,"id":"IhVgXa4z","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123829401,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)18:23:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123803900\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123803900<\/a><br>underrated","time":1493763809,"resto":123801851,"id":"g7NWGKcW","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123831544,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)18:40:22","name":"Anonymous","filename":"joeduplantiergojiracopenhellint2015_638 (1)","ext":".jpg","w":638,"h":359,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1493764822599,"time":1493764822,"md5":"Yrr7YHuNR581nzYm3d7\/Yg==","fsize":28500,"resto":123801851,"id":"EnDvVp7D","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123831848,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)18:42:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123823786\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123823786<\/a><br>Based.<br>Symphony of Destruction is a great song btw.","time":1493764967,"resto":123801851,"id":"5vD1oNx8","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123831990,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)18:43:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123801851\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123801851<\/a><br>Bruce Hampton dies on stage. <br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=sfA<wbr>9TJwhhwg","time":1493765033,"resto":123801851,"id":"mWR5DS2P","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

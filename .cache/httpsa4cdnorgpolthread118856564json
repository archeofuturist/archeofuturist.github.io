Its why we need sci-fi materials like carbon nano tubes to even entertain the possibility of a space elevator in real life. <br><br>On a smaller planet with less gravity, such as mars or even the moon, such a project is doable with current tech (kevlar or steel maybe) because 1. The lower gravity means longer length of cable before it snaps and 2. Mars has a very thin atmosphere, so less drag and other forces besides gravity to mess with the cable, and the moon has no atmosphere so even better. Also means less orbital decay due to atmospheric drag.<br><br><br>The orbital speed could be maintained with an ion thruster though. such a thing can function non stop and be powered by solar panels, which are ideally suited to space. An ion thruster lacks the thrust needed to lift objects into space and overcome the high gravity on earth, but in space its perfect for generating continuous small thrust that can counter-act small, constant losses in velocity. <br><br>The proposal here isnt even a space elevator. It would theoretically be possible with current tech as a sky hook, if you suspended a cable only part of the way into the atmosphere (up to the limit of the material, dunno how low to the ground that would be but most likely miles up in the air, nowhere near the ground). <br><br>You could then probably suspend a small lightweight structure of it and conceivably fly someone up there to live in it, but it would be very impractical.<br><br>Also for such a project, a single company funding it (especially on a whim) is out of the question.

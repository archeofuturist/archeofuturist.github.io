If it&#039;s great, costs for your own security protection will be low because crime is low, schooling will be to a higher quality and will be cheaper as it&#039;ll be somehow less difficult to tutor people from multiple cultures and backgrounds, and courts will be cheaper as multicultural societies will somehow be able to resolve conflicts more easily and quickly as they obviously agree on moral issues.<br><br>Clearly, this is not the case, and all of the above will be cheaper in areas resembling ethno-states.

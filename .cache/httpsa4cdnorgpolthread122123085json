Punishment can work without law. Can you go scream in a supermarket and shit on all the products? Of course not, state law isn&#039;t necessary for this, only a structure that enforces property rights.<br><br>Right-libertarianism allows discrimination through property rights, and any demographic that is seen as bad, and, subsequently, has higher costs associated with it, will have market forces drive it away from society, just as bad products are driven out of the market in many countries today.<br>If a city dislikes black people, then they&#039;d be willing to pay more to not live near black people, and this becomes a more profitable endeavour - landlords would jointly disallow black people from moving in.<br>Even better, though - incorrect ideas about what is bad and what is good get disproven through market forces in right-libertarianism. Think that multiculturalism is great? Go live in a multiculturalist area. If it&#039;s great, costs for your own security protection will be low because crime is low, schooling will be to a higher quality and will be cheaper as it&#039;ll be somehow less difficult to tutor people from multiple cultures and backgrounds, and courts will be cheaper as multicultural societies will somehow be able to resolve conflicts more easily and quickly as they obviously agree on moral issues.<br><br>Clearly, this is not the case, and all of the above will be cheaper in areas resembling ethno-states.

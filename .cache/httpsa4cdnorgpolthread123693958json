In Norse mythology, Bifr\u00f6st was a rainbow bridge that connected Midgard (Earth, essentially), and Asgard (Heaven). Knowing this, we could misconstrue the rainbow as a white supremacist neopagan symbol, serving as the gateway to &quot;white heaven&quot;, so to speak.","filename":"220px-Heimdall_an_der_Himmelsbr\u00fccke","ext":".jpg","w":220,"h":200,"tn_w":220,"tn_h":200,"tim":1493682870231,"time":1493682870,"md5":"UicwE8Xr14\/U\/3PzWlm5tA==","fsize":14229,"resto":0,"id":"rT\/KwOGe","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"operation-ragnarok","country_name":"United States","replies":7,"images":1,"unique_ips":2},{"no":123695913,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)20:11:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"Some more info from Wikipedia:<br><br>According to the Prose Edda, the bridge ends in heaven at Himinbj\u00f6rg, the residence of the god Heimdallr, who guards it from the j\u00f6tnar.

Trump has allegedly some Syrian hotels according to TIME magazine. In the article by TIME he even stated that he liked the Saudies. I also tried tying him to 9\/11 through his video in which he himself claims that bombs were used in the tower. Washington Compost then tried to say how Trump reset relations with the Saudis despite saying they did 9\/11. I then go on to say that this is all evidence a vast conspiracy that Donald Trump knew the Saudis did 9\/11 and they were merely working together so that America would have a reason to hate Iraqis and middle eastern people all while pushing their controlled opposition candidate through the white house. After all no one would suspect Trump to be on the Saudis side but now we were &quot;duped&quot; all along. It didn&#039;t seem to catch on very well. The conspiracy that is.","time":1493685708,"resto":123693958,"id":"6NHUkea8","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

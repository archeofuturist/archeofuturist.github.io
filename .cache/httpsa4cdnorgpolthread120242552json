Since we are assuming it would be racial libertarianism it wouldn&#039;t be seeing necessarily everyone as an individual, I think that there should be some sort of saftey net in a society for white families, and programs to help white families raise children. I guess I just disagree when it comes to the rich and taxes. I think it should be sort of like the 50&#039;s where they had high tax rates but big investment loopholes into their own workers, where they would raise wagers and set up more businesses to avoid the high tax.

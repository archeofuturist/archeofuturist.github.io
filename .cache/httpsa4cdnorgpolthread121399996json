That&#039;s why you can easily compare religions and find many similarities. Dionysus, Jesus, and Krishna for example all had similar lives according to their respective myths. The essential morality of most religions is also the same; avoid excessive brutality, take care of yourself and live with dignity, take care of your family and your nation, and struggle to fulfill your divine purpose in life.<br><br>Even if you are an atheist, you should at least accept that religion is an evolutionary adaptation made as a form of social cohesion and a way to make people less miserable.

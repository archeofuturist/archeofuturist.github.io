Simply asking if Climate Change is real and responding yes means you agree that it&#039;s man-made, irreversible and must be stopped by man immediately. <br><br>Is Climate Change even probable? Sure, take one look at China&#039;s smog cities and you&#039;ll get a glimpse of what too many emissions can do to anyplace. That aught to be enough to warrant limitations on pollutions large facilities can output. I think it&#039;s worth putting a cap on, same as dumping and drainage. Or at least forcing investment into counter-effecting technologies.<br><br>Is it irreversible? Nobody really knows. Just because the ozone is disappearing doesn&#039;t mean that the Earth cannot adapt - humans have only been creating the pollution for a very short part of our planet&#039;s life. Nature is not nearly as quick to change gears. Beyond that, the Earth has come back from both extreme heats and extreme colds, like its molten formation and ice ages. Climate has its own wide trends spanning hundreds of years. Even day-to-day weather is hard to predict, so you can imagine that larger time periods become a lot of educated guessing and modeling.<br><br>Harvesting energy will always have a cost environmentally. You cannot ignore the heat output from converting forms of natural power into electricity. Even &quot;clean&quot; forms of energy have problems - for example, wind turbines kill large amounts of birds. <br><br>Biologically speaking, it would make sense for plants that can convert these pollutants into nutrients for themselves would thrive.

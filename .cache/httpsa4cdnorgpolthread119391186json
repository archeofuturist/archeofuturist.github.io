The US treasury rate when used in the calculation is called the RISK FREE RATE, denoted &#039;r(f)&#039;. The entire financial system is built around the assumption that the US treasuries are default proof. When the treasury defaults on the interest premiums of its bonds it will basically change the value of everything in the world. You can be sure that this WILL happen if for no other reason then they tell you it&#039;s impossible. Luckily for the intelligent there will be obvious signs of its imminent failure. The most obvious will be a law forcing Americans to hold atleast 50% of their retirement accounts in Us treasuries (risk free treasuries) probably 10-20 year notes that will be sold as a &quot;tax advantage in vestment&quot; once people are forced to buy them (much like healthcare) the value of the securities will tank in value essentially erasing half of americans accumulated wealth while revaluing the other half to essentially 0 through massive inflation. <br><br>tl:dr were all gonna die.","time":1491259873,"resto":119391186,"id":"3qZzrf\/I","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119393982,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)18:58:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119391186\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119391186<\/a><br>The Pax Romana didn&#039;t end in some cataclysmic doomsday, it was a slow decline as degeneracy became the norm and people began believing that they didn&#039;t have to fight for their power.

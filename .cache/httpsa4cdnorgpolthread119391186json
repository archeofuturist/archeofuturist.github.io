The difference between the Empire and America is the inherent economic worth of each entity. While the Empire relied on is large, colonial holdings, where it retained a sovereign grip, it never held adopted those lands or people as an intrinsic part of itself. Unlike America, we&#039;ve fought a bloody and costly civil war to determine the ultimate power within our federation. <br><br>However, like the Empire after the end of WWI, it was incurring a lot of debt and was struggling under the world system it helped establish and run since the end of Napoleon almost a hundred years earlier. <br><br>We&#039;re seeing the same strains on the current world system that America help establish after World War II. That system will inevitably require either reforming or replacement, but in the macro geopolitical sense, that often means a large scale war. <br><br>Fundamentally, Pax Americana cannot last because of China and maybe later India. Pax Americana relies on America&#039;s economic might holding together the world&#039;s moneyed interests and using that to help fund the world&#039;s mightiest military and defacto global police force. As China, an antognistic actor in the current system and India, a friendly, but nonetheless ambitious actor, find the economic might, which leads to the military might, to buck American leadership with hard and soft power, an inevitable collision will happen. <br><br>It&#039;s not a question of when Pax Americana will end, but how. The British Empire was too weak to oppose rising Germany and let the problem become so big it helped almost destroy them.

It&#039;s hard to tell, given there&#039;s no known breakaway factions that are vying for power. However, like the USSR, the collapse was sudden and unexpected. I think China is a bit better off given their exposure to the highly connected global order, but the question is not so much will they collapse, but how they&#039;ll react to it. <br><br>China&#039;s most recent rise has not felt the brunt of a cascading disastrous economic depression. Even the 2008 crash was handled fairly well, though everyone played a part in trying to avoid complete disaster. These things happen in cycles and there will certainly be an economic crisis that resets a lot of the world&#039;s perceptions about how the system currently works. <br><br>As China has greatly benefited overall from the current system, they would likely want to save it from destruction. But when it dies, how China and its people react will say a lot. <br><br>China&#039;s growth since the Cultural Revolution has helped keep its people going. Through all the very difficult growth they&#039;re least protected have had to endure, they&#039;ve at least made a lot more money than their previous generations. But once that starts to plateau or even go back, the chinese people may not like what they&#039;re getting so much anymore. <br><br>However, even during the time of Mao AND the cultural revolution, China did not break up. And as technology advances, China has smartly used the latest and greatest tech to create a hyper surveillance program on its own people. <br><br>Even if OUR deep state has the ability to spy on every American and person in the world, China would surely use those abilities without regard to laws or repercussions as long as the state always won in the end. <br><br>The CPC has made the transfer of power only a few times in its most recent form.

What I mean is that I have observed how most atheists love a woman from the standpoint of simple animalistic pleasures like how they like the smell, the touch and the emotions about a specific woman they enjoy the company of, but in my opinion, it&#039;s so much more important to find out if you are able to vision spending your life with her together. Just merely enjoying being degenerate together seems very empty, because you know that she will grow old one day and lose the beauty of her youth, same happens to you too. You gotta have something more than that going on for you two together. That is where faith in God can be a great asset. It&#039;s not a mere meme in christian tradition that bodies can be separate, but spirit can unite as one.<br><br>Sorry if I sound like larping today, I am normally just a humble shitposter, but this thread has just been really inspiring.","time":1492720809,"resto":122029031,"id":"q0PkiX6u","country":"EE","country_name":"Estonia"},{"no":122040602,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)16:40:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122038346\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122038346<\/a><br><br>Listen to this burger here OP.

Biologically speaking, the only reason we live is to fuck and breed. In the current post-sexual liberation paradigm (a return to the natural order in the realm of relationships), you&#039;ll have an increasing number of men unable to get that, so you&#039;ll probably have more Elliot&#039;s and Cho&#039;s in the future, because without access to a mate (sex, affection and maybe reproduction), most men have no fundamental interest in society. Like Gad Saad says, a society where most men aren&#039;t mated won&#039;t be conducive to peace.<br>Cheap bread and circuses are a good buffer, but if you want to avoid civil unrest, you&#039;ll have to at least add legalized cannabis and shame-free prostitution to that.Either you&#039;re a tournament species or you&#039;re a civilization (marriage), you can&#039;t ask millions of males &quot;just work, work, work, shut up and die alone without getting any recognition or affection while we give your taxes to Stacey to fund her orgies with Chad, Brad and Tyrone&quot;. This isn&#039;t sustainable. It&#039;s a wrongful termination of the social contract. Men who see soon enough that they have no place in society will go full &quot;beautiful ones&quot; (opt out) and those who break their back all their life expecting to get the package they were promised only to suddenly realize they&#039;ve been lied to will snap.

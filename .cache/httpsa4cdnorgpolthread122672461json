The left has done well in portraying Christians as nut jobs. <br><br>Christian numbers in Asian countries are rising fast though. Trump and the Christian right gave some hope in increasing Christian numbers but in the end I think Atheism in the West will over take the Christians in 50 years.

If Pope Francis was truly the decedent of Peter he would have seen the invasion as an opportunity for even more religious piety.<br><br>Muslims show that they will convert IF they find a church that exemplifies the strength and piety they got in their mosque but so few churches have this. Orthodox gets the lions share of converts but they are insular communities and do extreme vetting so they don&#039;t get fucked up or suicide bombed, its too slow to defend against Islamic invasion.<br><br>Real Pope would have reorganized church doctrine to put the focus on family and prayer. Muslims need to pray daily and think its disgusting we don&#039;t. Women need to be told to make families and stop wearing disgusting clothes. Islamics would convert if church felt like home.<br><br>Marriage and family needs to be encouraged again, get more dating and cross gender socials.

Still eat the cookie and drink the wine and reimagine it to being sharing in the gifts of Jesus or something.

By the time they\u2019re in their mid-twenties, people are infected and it\u2019s too late. This is a vaccine against cancer \u2014 that\u2019s the message.\u201d<br><br>The highest rate, 33.7 percent, was found among non-Hispanic blacks; the lowest, 11.9 percent, among Asians. The prevalence of genital HPV infection is 21.6 percent among whites and 21.7 percent among Hispanics.<br><br>Men generally have somewhat higher rates than women, but among Asian and Hispanic men, the infections are not significantly more common. The reasons for these variations are not known.","filename":"Screen Shot 2017-04-06 at 5.08.07 PM","ext":".png","w":1234,"h":582,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":117,"tim":1491512979185,"time":1491512979,"md5":"qIPvJTXa5x3pWYsq0AW\/SQ==","fsize":101343,"resto":0,"id":"lU6hjBp8","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"nearly-half-of-americans-infected-with-hpv","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":119795507,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)17:10:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"This is what happens when they decide that only girls needed the vaccine","time":1491513054,"resto":119795338,"id":"963a8ZjX","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

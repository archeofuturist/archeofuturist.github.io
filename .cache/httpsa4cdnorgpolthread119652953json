Even if people try, it&#039;s inhuman to be unbiased and it will represent itself in one form or another, either by covering stories through a biased lens or through omission of stories which the writers don&#039;t feel the need to write articles over. Everyone&#039;s a little myopic, and that includes the people who are trying to be &#039;unbiased&#039;.<br><br>I think the best thing someone can do to stay informed is to read a variety of publications, particularly one source which defines itself as &#039;liberal&#039; and another which defines itself as &#039;conservative&#039;. I&#039;ll usually read Politico, The Federalist, the New York Times, etc. I just stick them in my RSS feed and click whatever headlines interest me. Just because I read something doesn&#039;t mean I need to agree with it.","time":1491425364,"resto":119652953,"id":"apZConIH","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119654216,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)16:50:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"Read them all form your own opinion<br><br>Everything is biased anon","time":1491425410,"resto":119652953,"id":"2Grub54t","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

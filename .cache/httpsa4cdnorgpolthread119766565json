Geoengineering is being developed and manmade regulation of element cycles are in research so it&#039;s not the end of the world if we continue emissions as we are right now. But definitely reduction in emissions is critically needed for everything to be stabilized at the end of the century and beyond. Cutting these emissions is not too hard - for example, methane can be reduced by cutting meat consumption and therefore livestock.","time":1491504867,"resto":119766565,"id":"1xDrUIjb","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119777246,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)14:55:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119774128\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119774128<\/a><br>I like this idea better.","time":1491504958,"resto":119766565,"id":"F8xMznJy","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119777314,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)14:56:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119766644\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119766644<\/a><br>Fpbp and \/thread<br>Sums it up pretty nicely and we should first tackle that what we can change right now.

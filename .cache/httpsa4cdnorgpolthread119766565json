The idea in everyone&#039;s head is that greenhouse gasses are slowly building up year after year after year and at a certain point it is going to hit an event horizon scenario where we will all be fucked.<br><br>What they don&#039;t tell you is that the earth manages to removed a shitload of the CO2 each year. It doesn&#039;t build up. We produce so much that the earth is currently in heightened levels of CO2 yes but it&#039;s not a build up.<br><br>Okay to try to look at it another way they make it seem like the number is increasing constantly. To use easy numbers just assume that in 2000 we had something like a million tons of CO2 in the atmosphere and then it went up by a million each year until we hit 10 million in 2010. <br><br>In reality it went more like 1.01, 1.03, 1.04,.... and now we are at something like 1.2 million. It builds up mostly in winter as we increase fuel consumption to keep ourselves warm and the majority of the plants hibernate.

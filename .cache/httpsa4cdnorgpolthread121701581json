But the marchers and the activists who organized them will soon have to address what follows the demonstrations. <br><br>\u201cWe have no intention of letting this stop after April 22,\u201d said Dr. Caroline Weinberg, a public health researcher and co-chairwoman of the march. \u201cI will have considered it pretty much a failure if after April 22 all of this movement and all of this passion dissipates.\u201d<br><br>Most eyes will be on Washington, where the main march will occur. But there will also be rallies in medical hubs like Boston, technology centers like San Francisco and even in the heart of oil and gas country, Oklahoma City. The strength of these satellite events could be important indicators of where the activism generated by the march will head in the future.<br><br>The day will begin with teach-in sessions, followed by a four-hour rally featuring Bill Nye the Science Guy, Dr. Mona Hanna-Attisha, the pediatrician who helped expose lead poisoning in Flint, Mich., and Lydia Villa-Komaroff, who helped produce insulin from bacteria, among others, before culminating with the march.<br><br>For Dr. Weinberg, the idea to march began in late January when she heard that the Trump administration had ordered federal agencies to temporarily halt external communications that inform the public. She found a group of scientists on Twitter who shared her concerns.","filename":"protest2","ext":".jpg","w":1956,"h":1376,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":175,"tim":1492531970301,"time":1492531970,"md5":"o1xxHPFZaG7JJrDuI8UwUw==","fsize":799528,"resto":0,"id":"FFC1tVRE","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"marches-for-science-this-saturday-anyone-here","country_name":"United States","replies":4,"images":1,"unique_ips":5},{"no":121701942,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)12:16:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121701581\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121701581<\/a><br>march for (((science)))<br>If they really supported science they would be like Commander Academician Prokhor Zakharov","filename":"forihavetastedthefruit","ext":".gif","w":150,"h":150,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492532163823,"time":1492532163,"md5":"bmRkDm61ytPsCZJucM2j0Q==","fsize":41802,"resto":121701581,"id":"25vKiya3","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121701958,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)12:16:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121701581\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121701581<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;We need to clean up our air for our children!&quot;<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;Just the ones we don&#039;t abort!&quot;<\/span>","time":1492532172,"resto":121701581,"id":"s5pClr3l","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121702272,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)12:18:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121701581\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121701581<\/a><br>Mean while they shut down neurological research because it could have racist but lifesaving implications","time":1492532329,"resto":121701581,"id":"nu6OxQ9V","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121704388,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)12:35:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121701581\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121701581<\/a><br>bump","time":1492533335,"resto":121701581,"id":"emPuTjQ9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

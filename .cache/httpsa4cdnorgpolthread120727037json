The heat is on to dump Bannon no doubt. But alt media has a huge hard on for Bannon. If they ousted him the backlash would be bigger than the Syria strike. Bannon could even go back to Breitbart and raise all hell against the globalists and neocons that infiltrated the White House.","time":1491984347,"resto":120727037,"id":"x1VSw58y","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120731625,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)04:07:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"trump is a faggot now<br>im sure they did something to him","time":1491984426,"resto":120727037,"id":"kd1ldf4\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120731629,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)04:07:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120727037\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120727037<\/a><br>Hey everyone look, it&#039;s the same malaysian shitposter who posts &quot;drumpf btfo&quot; in every fucking thread","time":1491984428,"resto":120727037,"id":"4zm2TOOw","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120731661,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)04:07:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120731358\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120731358<\/a><br>you cant defend anybody accused of a sex crime during that month?

A good example is starting off with &quot;ban all muslims&quot;. He let the public battle over it for months before he actually put down a concrete proposal.

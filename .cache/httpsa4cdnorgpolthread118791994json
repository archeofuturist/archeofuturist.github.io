More than any other news agency, these guys are the fakest of the fake and they hate when people call them out for it. I have made it my own personal goal to search multiple search terms every day with things like &quot;cnn fake news&quot; &quot;anderson cooper fake news&quot; &quot;don lemon fake news&quot; Anderson cooper CIA agent&quot; &quot;cnn is fake news&quot; etc... if everyone starts doing this then i hope that when a normie just puts &quot;CNN&quot; in the search bar, then &quot;CNN FAKE NEWS&quot; will pop up below in the suggested results. Thats where i need your help \/Pol\/ i need as many people to do this every day, it will ony take about 2 mins max, and will result in Ultimate Lulz, once the plan works, we will have tucker carlson make a note of it on his show, and force cnn to adress the issue, thus red pilling even more normies.","filename":"CNN-fake-news","ext":".jpg","w":700,"h":400,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":142,"tim":1490798390195,"time":1490798390,"md5":"Oh5cXH4dh4FTgvY3DQihyw==","fsize":43403,"resto":0,"id":"jjEo8P8k","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"cnn-fake-news","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

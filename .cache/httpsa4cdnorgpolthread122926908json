Trump is perfectly willing to walk away from a deal, or just wait for the right conditions to change, to strike. After reading that, I became a lot more confident in what Trump is doing. I bet when his presidential memoirs come out years from now, we&#039;ll read a lot about how these early moves were more about him staking out a negotiating position and letting the situation ripen to his favor.","time":1493236722,"resto":122926908,"id":"UWBER24x","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

Then justify why coercion and force are justified or necessary in doing so if you can hit the first point.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I believe that a gov...<\/span><br>What if their interests involve not paying taxes? <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I would like to believe...<\/span><br>Me too hence why I listed more than just genetic factors.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Do these people hold power over regular citizens of this society?<\/span><br>Because they&#039;re members of the community who also subscribe to the social contracts they hold responsibility more than power. Without the legitimacy of citizen backing for failing their responsibilities they have no power. For instance if we reduce it down to a tiny example of 100 people, and they pay five men to act as a policing force in ensuring safety and the upholding of social contracts, those five men are fathers and husbands and uncles and friends of the people in the community an it is their responsibility and interest to police it fairly and diligently because of this. If they lose their legitimacy in failing to uphold social contracts then they&#039;re not longer acting as the policing force but instead in opposition to it.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;My concern is...<\/span><br>Again there&#039;s a sharp difference between government, the act of regulating community behaviour through mutually agreed contract, and the Government that you have come to know as the presiding conglomeration of lobbies, lawmakers, courts, coercive measures, bureaucracy, stratification, violence, holding power of decreed rule without the agreed contract over the people within its declared borders.","filename":"12479640_228275110864416_1656703615_n","ext":".jpg","w":750,"h":937,"tn_w":200,"tn_h":249,"tim":1493023728435,"time":1493023728,"md5":"fYEBjasV0i2clTMSUjf1Mw==","fsize":101957,"resto":0,"id":"xAIM\/81s","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"122563678","country_name":"Canada","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

Without the legitimacy of citizen backing for failing their responsibilities they have no power. For instance if we reduce it down to a tiny example of 100 people, and they pay five men to act as a policing force in ensuring safety and the upholding of social contracts, those five men are fathers and husbands and uncles and friends of the people in the community an it is their responsibility and interest to police it fairly and diligently because of this. If they lose their legitimacy in failing to uphold social contracts then they&#039;re not longer acting as the policing force but instead in opposition to it.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;My concern is...<\/span><br>Again there&#039;s a sharp difference between government, the act of regulating community behaviour through mutually agreed contract, and the Government that you have come to know as the presiding conglomeration of lobbies, lawmakers, courts, coercive measures, bureaucracy, stratification, violence, holding power of decreed rule without the agreed contract over the people within its declared borders.","filename":"12479640_228275110864416_1656703615_n","ext":".jpg","w":750,"h":937,"tn_w":200,"tn_h":249,"tim":1493023728435,"time":1493023728,"md5":"fYEBjasV0i2clTMSUjf1Mw==","fsize":101957,"resto":0,"id":"xAIM\/81s","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"122563678","country_name":"Canada","replies":3,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":122565579,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)05:04:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122564559\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122564559<\/a><br>If not to benefit the people, what do they exist for? I think governments use coercion and force to enforce their view on how they might best benefit the public on people who do not agree with their views. All laws are made by the people are they not? I do not think there is some abstract organization creating laws for the sole purpose of subjugating the populous. The problem with this is that if you try to govern many people all at once, some will not like your laws. However, you need to force them to obey your laws so that you may benefit the maximum amount of people even if that requires sacrificing a small percentage of the population.<br><br>Sometimes, some people might not agree with some laws the government makes, sometimes they do. I can not argue that the sole result of government is the benefit of the populous, but that is their intend purpose. There are of course many flaws and loopholes in their system.<br><br>If their interests involve not paying taxes, then they ought not live within that community or that country or benefit from any service the government provides. However, if they do choose to live in the country and benefit from doing so, they ought to pay their due share.<br><br>I am trying to define government as any sort of system of social order. Whether it&#039;s communist, democratic, or self governing as you are saying. As long as there is a system for public discourse, I consider that a government. However, I can tell that is not what you mean by government and I am interested in knowing what you define it as.<br><br>Overall, I think that any formation of a society leads to government like the governments of today. If you were to form your society, it would not evolve as you think it would and we would have some sort of hierarchy like we see now. However, I think this can be beneficial as it will help out the society more than a total lack of government, in what I think government is.<br>Again, I do not think that&#039;s how you define government.","time":1493024672,"resto":122564559,"id":"oXg+ahLn","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122566355,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)05:15:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122564559\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122564559<\/a><br>ah, on second reading I understand what you mean now. I think I agree with you that the Government and you describe with the capital G is not good. I think that that is a result of people attempting to exploit the system for their own gain which resulted in this mess. Probably originally, these courts and such were created for good intentions but were abused to become what they are now.<br><br>I think, then, that our views of governance are pretty similar. People who govern themselves through pooling together resources. I think the only part where we differ is that I am slightly more open to the prospect of higher powers in governance than you do mostly because I think that these are necessary to take care of a country with a population in the hundreds of millions. Overall though, I think I understand what you mean.","time":1493025346,"resto":122564559,"id":"oXg+ahLn","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122566570,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)05:18:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122564559\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122564559<\/a><br>It has been great talking with you but I&#039;ve got to get to sleep now.

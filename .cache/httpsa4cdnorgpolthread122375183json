If god exist it&#039;s not a human construct, the word god is obviously man made to describe god all mighty. But people back in the ages probably also used rational thinking and therefore assumed there was a god and therefore praid to him. It&#039;s not like someone built their own god, therefore the construct can&#039;t be man made other then the notion of god. Becuse god exist and you can&#039;t<br> make up something that exist it&#039;s like defining a animal and then saying animals are a human construct, it&#039;s stupid.","filename":"atheism","ext":".jpg","w":225,"h":225,"tn_w":225,"tn_h":225,"tim":1492919405708,"time":1492919405,"md5":"Lfqqmaqqo\/mgDV70qzOsLA==","fsize":22851,"resto":0,"id":"WvdxexnI","country":"SE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"cotinuation-of-thread","country_name":"Sweden","replies":11,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":122375626,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)23:54:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/122358376#p122373564\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122373564<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;42%<\/span><br><br>kill yourself","time":1492919640,"resto":122375183,"id":"WvdxexnI","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":122375832,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)23:56:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122375626\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122375626<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;there was nothing<\/span><br><br>Wrong.<br>No matter was created","time":1492919773,"resto":122375183,"id":"KmrY\/K52","country":"AR","country_name":"Argentina"},{"no":122375874,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)23:56:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/122358376#p122373535\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122373535<\/a><br><br>The jewish faith and the islamic faith are heresy and need to be punished by death.

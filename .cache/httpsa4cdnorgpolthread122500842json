A lot of politicians when they come on stage to speak are just better versed versions of Miss Universe when they pop on stage to preach love and world peace. I also don&#039;t think the EU is necessarily aiming to be EUSSR or that the people at the top have ill sentiment to the rest of the continent.

I can&#039;t criticize those people for where their priorities may or may not lean but they are easily exploitable by ideological yet unreasonable and un-achievable political dogma hence why my thoughts on it went from upset to anger to pretty outright disgusted to now just apathetic plus a million other feelings around the entire thing.

In terms of intermarriage between Asians and Whites or something, it&#039;s not something significant that we really have to deal with. It&#039;s not like half of the country is East-Asian and the other half is White and we&#039;re all mixing - that is simply not happening on that scale, so it&#039;s simply not an important question. I don&#039;t feel like intermarriage is really threatening White Identity.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; https\/\/archive.is\/PwiwG<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Homosexuality seems to be a kind of last stand of implicit White identity.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; https:\/\/archive.is\/DNFeK<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Homosexuality has been a part of European societies and culture for millennia.

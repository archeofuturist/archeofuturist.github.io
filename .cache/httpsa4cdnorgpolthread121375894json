When my friend had trouble working the subway system like 5 random strangers stopped to help. It was a bit embarrassing though to see almost every historical site had some sign mentioning how it was reconstructed after we bombed the shit out of it in 1945. Also the weirdest thing for me was Japanese tv, I didn&#039;t realize how jarring it was to not see &quot;diversity&quot; everywhere. Every commercial was 100% Japonese people. Honestly made me pretty sad when I realized just how much of a low-trust mud slop burgerland is in comparison.","time":1492378266,"resto":121375894,"id":"JWpVgZSe","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121418173,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)17:31:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121376000\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121376000<\/a><br>Yeah, what a pussy move.","time":1492378277,"resto":121375894,"id":"OY56HfpG","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":121418258,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)17:31:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"Japaneses are workslave though.<br>I wouldn&#039;t want my life to be based on my work to be a literal brainwashed robot","time":1492378314,"resto":121375894,"id":"8GSrEY52","country":"CH","country_name":"Switzerland"},{"no":121418409,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)17:32:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121418133\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121418133<\/a><br>Race purity is not immorality aggressive or evil quite the opposite it is peaceful beautiful and moral.<br><br>The ones who hate races are multi racialists who hate all races and want to change them all.","time":1492378370,"resto":121375894,"id":"Q6afG15x","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121418459,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)17:33:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121417124\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121417124<\/a><br>Real beer isn&#039;t cheap there<br>He&#039;s probably talking about happoushu","time":1492378384,"resto":121375894,"id":"R6zc3rlC","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":121418499,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)17:33:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121375894\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121375894<\/a>","filename":"japan superior culture","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":684,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1492378396888,"time":1492378396,"md5":"6arojgctjCNdMbo0ZIaWXQ==","fsize":444360,"resto":121375894,"id":"YgiWGQmT","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121418501,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)17:33:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121418258\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121418258<\/a><br>Only six hours of those twelve hour shifts are spent doing actual work to be honest.","time":1492378398,"resto":121375894,"id":"GRQmoGZz","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121419229,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)17:37:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121375894\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121375894<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; legal sexual services<\/span><br>Elaborate","time":1492378647,"resto":121375894,"id":"5MVdrH6E","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121419648,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)17:39:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"Also japaneses and their &quot;honne - tatemae&quot;, you guys are fake ass.<br>Honestly your country look like a fake, to me you aren&#039;t people but robots.<br>You live for your work, you kowtow to everyone in society, so hypocrite... where&#039;s your free will","time":1492378789,"resto":121375894,"id":"8GSrEY52","country":"CH","country_name":"Switzerland"},{"no":121420112,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)17:42:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121419229\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121419229<\/a><br>Hookers dum dum","time":1492378947,"resto":121375894,"id":"JWpVgZSe","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121420126,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)17:42:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121417792\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121417792<\/a><br>Yep, that&#039;s true too. The more you learn about Japan, the more you realize that a lot of Japanese culture is a modern development. Bushido for example was basically created in 1899. Yes, the word bushido existed before that, but what people think of as Bushido today was created in 1899. In the late 19th century, a Japanese dude, who was Christian, went to study in Europe and was impressed by tales of European knights and chivalry. He went back home to Japan and wrote a book about &quot;Bushido&quot; which basically copied European chivalry and replaced them with samurai.","time":1492378954,"resto":121375894,"id":"quNSj8qd","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121420342,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)17:43:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121420126\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121420126<\/a><br>And then the Japanese government adopted that book&#039;s concept of &quot;Bushido&quot; to support their military agenda, and the rest is history.","time":1492379033,"resto":121375894,"id":"quNSj8qd","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121420370,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)17:44:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"You know why Scandinavia and Japan are doing so well? well you know what they have in common? <br>Whaling <br>What has the rest of the world outlawed?<br>Whaling","time":1492379043,"resto":121375894,"id":"EQ9D\/+G0","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":121420569,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)17:45:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121375894\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121375894<\/a><br>the jew fears the samuari<br><br>you&#039;ll find nothing but love here","filename":"Screen_shot_2011-01-06_at_7_51_55_PM_3089","ext":".png","w":296,"h":411,"tn_w":90,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492379116260,"time":1492379116,"md5":"W+4cyCqHaRc5H3Ad3uvgtg==","fsize":108599,"resto":121375894,"id":"x8Na2kRJ","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121420620,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)17:45:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121418499\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121418499<\/a><br>She did for charity.","time":1492379132,"resto":121375894,"id":"rw5Mw4nN","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":121420665,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)17:45:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121420620\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121420620<\/a><br>*it","time":1492379149,"resto":121375894,"id":"rw5Mw4nN","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":121420745,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)17:46:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121420112\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121420112<\/a><br>I was hoping for more","time":1492379177,"resto":121375894,"id":"5MVdrH6E","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121421091,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)17:48:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121383919\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121383919<\/a><br>We are your future, except instead of having relatively well-assimilated, hard-working Latinos you&#039;re going to have hordes of 70 IQ muslim sandniggers who consume 5000 euromerkels per month in welfare.","time":1492379280,"resto":121375894,"id":"ZYmtw8fa","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121421160,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)17:48:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121421091\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121421091<\/a><br>Per capita, I should add.","time":1492379303,"resto":121375894,"id":"ZYmtw8fa","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121421305,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)17:49:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121375894\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121375894<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt; beer cost $2<\/span><br>Is this true?","time":1492379353,"resto":121375894,"id":"FhAIh0dv","country":"RS","country_name":"Serbia"},{"no":121421536,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)17:50:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121376516\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121376516<\/a><br>Their fertility rate is on the rise though.","time":1492379437,"resto":121375894,"id":"FhAIh0dv","country":"RS","country_name":"Serbia"},{"no":121422004,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)17:53:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121404868\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121404868<\/a><br><br>At least its not in real life like germany","time":1492379591,"resto":121375894,"id":"EdNNApnp","country":"JP","country_name":"Japan"},{"no":121422685,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)17:57:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121376000\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121376000<\/a><br>When niggers are worse for your country than 2 nukes feels bad","time":1492379830,"resto":121375894,"id":"sF6uFSSG","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121423286,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)18:00:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121377144\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121377144<\/a><br>Why do Japs always have to take things to far","time":1492380035,"resto":121375894,"id":"LNpV3UNA","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121424240,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)18:06:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121378549\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121378549<\/a><br>This.","time":1492380375,"resto":121375894,"id":"0N6GLoqh","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

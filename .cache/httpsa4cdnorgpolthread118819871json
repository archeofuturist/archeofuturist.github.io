For a houndred years we searched for the document with 0 luck. Suddently we announce a reward and BAM here comes the document. The document appearntly was found in some low imporatnce geman ar4chive burried beneath other papers. The original document was founf in original (lithuanian) language and a rewritten copy with german language. These 2 docs were found next to each other.<br><br>I myself think this is farse- not that the document is fake, but the idea that we just suddently found it. Im 99% sure germans knew about it for years and they did not give it back to us.<br>Now the question is why would germany suddently just give up on the docoment? Does germany want to have warm feeling with us or something? DOes germany actually care about us? probably not. So whats the deal here?

It would have looked exactly the same. The observations, at least before the telescope, would have been identical. The geocentric explanation was perfectly reasonable until Copernicus made his observations.<br><br>There is a lesson here for rhetoric, that can be used in racial arguments.<br><br>When you point out the disproportionate black crime statistics, and someone complains that this is the result of racism. Ask them:<br><br>&quot;Assuming that everything you say about racism is true. That you&#039;re 100% right about racism. What would the statistics look like if it were still the case that blacks were more likely to commit crimes?&quot;<br><br>Then watch their heads explode.

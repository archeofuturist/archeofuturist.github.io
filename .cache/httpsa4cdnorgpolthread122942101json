No troll. No shitposting. Is anyone else regretful for voting for Trump? I&#039;ve started to realize he isn&#039;t the intelligent 4d chess wizard you all thought he was. I voted for him because I thought he&#039;d be better than hillary and would shut the borders down, but he has failed at everything.<br><br>Now this cuckservative congress is voting for these billionaire tax cuts and gutting any social safety net and SOPA 99999.0 just like in the bush days while accomplishing NONE of the things trump said.<br><br>I feel like I was conned by a snake oil salesman. And no this isn&#039;t a &quot;but seriously we can&#039;t let this guy have the nuclear codes&quot; meme.

They won&#039;t ruin our schools and our youth. They will remain to exists but they&#039;ll be even more fringe then they are now. Most people aren&#039;t SJW&#039;s but the SJW&#039;s have the power. If people were cut off from this political bullshit we&#039;ll start to see that most of society isn&#039;t like those idiots. Most people are afraid to voice their distaste with current PC-culture because it might cost them their job.<br>Also if we remove welfare and ridiculous alimony payments society would recover.<br>You can be a nigger and have nothing to eat and decide to steal some shit and get shot or you can be a nigger and decide to work and make something of yourself. We need to achieve true equality under law and not this bullshit that people are pushing nowadays. You can divorce your husband but now you need to fend for yourself. Why not make it work and not be a slut?<br><br>I tend to think authoritarian too at times.<br>But I try to not be a hypocrite.<br>If we move further with this leftist globalist nonsense we are either ending up with a revolution and a true libertarian society or with an insane populist taking power cause we just want to push back as hard as we possibly can.","time":1491140928,"resto":119188191,"id":"v6xc8HU8","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":119201699,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)10:00:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119200640\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119200640<\/a><br>What&#039;s your opinion on my point here<br><a href=\"#p119189004\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119189004<\/a><br>and here<br><a href=\"#p119196262\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119196262<\/a><br>about self preservation for Libertarians? Would there be other ways of preventing the current society or worse from repeating besides praying on the goodwill of others? It just doesn&#039;t seem reliable to do that, considering that this country started off &quot;deconstructing their bullshit with arguments&quot; and then, over time, that became less common and Leftism was able to spread. Hell, we have a situation now where these people ignore when we destroy them in arguments, I don&#039;t see how assuming people will stop pushing Leftism when we beat them in debate is practical.","filename":"1472016064026","ext":".png","w":722,"h":768,"tn_w":117,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491141644552,"time":1491141644,"md5":"9XL8K18gUcGek2rR+nT16Q==","fsize":311146,"resto":119188191,"id":"dVqU+iWE","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119202104,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)10:04:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119201699\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119201699<\/a><br>I forgot to say that while Libertarians are individualistic, in my view ironically the society they want will only be sustainable if everyone thinks the same way.","time":1491141887,"resto":119188191,"id":"dVqU+iWE","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119202471,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)10:08:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119201699\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119201699<\/a><br>It is a neverending circle.<br>People get free.<br>New generation sees freedom as something that is normal.<br>Freedom gets diminished through well intended but wrong legislation.<br>Society becomes more and more oppressive.<br>People break away from this either by going back to a free society or by fascism.<br>People don&#039;t want to live under a fascist system so they eventually break free from this as well.<br><br>If we manage to stop the nanny state in the western world most of it&#039;s problems will be solved within 2 generations.","time":1491142112,"resto":119188191,"id":"v6xc8HU8","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":119202599,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)10:09:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119202104\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119202104<\/a><br>I think everybody should be free to live an individual live but as a society we should strive for unity.","time":1491142182,"resto":119188191,"id":"v6xc8HU8","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":119203065,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)10:14:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119202471\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119202471<\/a><br>Interesting take on society.

I didn&#039;t use to be on the internet too much and didn&#039;t really have any friends. I 2015 I met a boy who I became close friends with. At some point he started introducing me to different memes (I think the first one was Le Lenny (I absolutely had no idea about internet culture)) at some point he started showing me 4chan thread and he introduced me to a small online community with some 4chan users in it. I would often look at his phone screen during lunch break as he was browsing different threads. Somewhere in januari 2016 I started browsing \/pol\/ (and very occasionally \/b\/). somewhere In March 2016 I started posting basic Holohoax and HDNW threads and started posting about other subjects a few weeks later. In May 2016 I started using 4chan more often and I also started browsing ylyl threads on \/b\/. Around July 2016 I started using 4chan less frequently again but I would use it more frequently in my depressed periods. Since about a month ago I&#039;ve been browsing both \/b\/, \/pol\/ and occasionally different other boards during almost all of my free time and when I&#039;m not browsing 4chan I&#039;m either feeding my anime, sudoku or porn (unless it&#039;s a a fap thread that&#039;s in 4chan obviously) addiction (I used to be able to do those things ironically but I&#039;m addicted now). Anyways the funny thing is that I had never been on Reddit or any meme site before I started browsing 4chan so it was my first experience with higher internet culture","time":1490736235,"resto":118694048,"id":"6d5VE6NM","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":118698724,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)17:24:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118694627\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118694627<\/a><br>Desu","time":1490736246,"resto":118694048,"id":"\/oFkKwgx","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118698784,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)17:24:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118698702\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118698702<\/a><br>That took ages to type but I needed to get it off my chest.","time":1490736278,"resto":118694048,"id":"6d5VE6NM","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":118698875,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)17:25:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118694048\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118694048<\/a><br>110","time":1490736327,"resto":118694048,"id":"t3kcXzFj","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118699076,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)17:27:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118698875\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118698875<\/a><br>127.

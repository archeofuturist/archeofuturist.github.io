It\u2019s not necessarily to attract the opposite sex<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Of course Zelda is a proxy for a child, but getting a cat is just what we \u2018modern, sensitive guys\u2019 do these days. No wonder so many British men are doing it<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; For I am a male cat owner \u2013 a \u201ccat dad\u201d, if you must \u2013 and apparently there are loads of us now. Cats are \u201cstealing the hearts of UK men\u201d, reports a delighted BBC, following a survey that found 17% of UK men now have a pet cat, up from 13% in 2016. Why might this be, a nation asks.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; What this survey doesn\u2019t mention is age, and I bet it\u2019s men in their 30s and 40s who are really behind all this. The theory of pets being a proxy for a child is an old chestnut, but it\u2019s surely true, and maybe men are now embracing this.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; I therefore have the pleasure of nurturing a living thing, without having to sacrifice sleep or a social life (I promise I have friends too, absolutely loads of them). In fact, the only sacrifices I\u2019ve had to make are privacy in the shower, and a roughly \u00a350 annual spend on children\u2019s plasters. Which makes me think having a cat is no more a preparation for fatherhood than having a basil plant. If anything, basil plants are harder to keep alive.<\/span><br><br>http:\/\/archive.is\/GDavU","filename":"man_cat","ext":".jpg","w":333,"h":342,"tn_w":243,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491308237139,"time":1491308237,"md5":"u3Fy64Ide9ykF3C2F34QdA==","fsize":43688,"resto":0,"id":"wdjDiHj3","country":"FR","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"why-become-a-cat-dad-its-not-necessarily-to","country_name":"France","replies":82,"images":13,"unique_ips":49},{"no":119463761,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)08:21:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"Dallas Green is such a faggot","time":1491308497,"resto":119463419,"id":"SLq\/OgAO","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119463940,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)08:23:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119463419\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119463419<\/a><br>i own a cat too","time":1491308631,"resto":119463419,"id":"8PZilNl7","country":"TR","country_name":"Turkey"},{"no":119463957,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)08:24:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119463419\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119463419<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;tfw love cats<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;tfw cucks are trying to make cats a libtard thing<\/span><br><br>YOU CROSSED THE LINE.

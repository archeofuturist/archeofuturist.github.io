Boodberg noted that the Buluoji in the Chinese sources were recorded as remnants of the Xiongnu confederation,[32] and had strong Caucasian elements.[33]","time":1490601524,"resto":118481161,"id":"l2TM5FTz","country":"TR","country_name":"Turkey"},{"no":118488415,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)03:59:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118488367\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118488367<\/a><br><br>Another theory linking the Bulgars to a Turkic people of Inner Asia has been put forward by Boris Simeonov, who identified them with the Pugu (\u50d5\u9aa8; buk\/buok kw\u0259t; Buqut), a Tiele and\/or Toquz Oguz tribe.[34][35] The Pugu were mentioned in Chinese sources from 103 BC up to the 8th century AD,[35] and later were situated among the eastern Tiele tribes, as one of the highest-ranking tribes after the Uyghurs.[34] According to the Chronicle by Michael the Syrian, which comprises several historical events of different age into one story, three mythical Scythian brothers set out on a journey from the mountain Imaon (Tian Shan) in Asia and reached the river Tanais (Don), the country of the Alans called Barsalia, which would be later inhabited by the Bulgars and the Pugurs (Puguraje).[36]<br><br>The names Ono\u011fur and Bulgar were linked by later Byzantine sources for reasons that are unclear.[37][24][25] Karatay interpreted gur\/gor as &quot;country&quot;, and noted the Tekin derivation of gur from the Altaic suffix -gir, which is related to the word yir, meaning &quot;earth, place&quot;.[38] Generally, modern scholars consider the terms o\u011fuz or o\u011fur, as generic terms for Turkic tribal confederations, to be derived from Turkic *og\/uq, meaning &quot;kinship or being akin to&quot;.[39] The terms initially were not the same, as oq\/ogsiz meant &quot;arrow&quot;,[40] while o\u011ful meant &quot;offspring, child, son&quot;, o\u011fu\u0161\/u\u011fu\u0161 was &quot;tribe, clan&quot;, and the verb o\u011f\u0161a-\/oq\u0161a meant &quot;to be like, resemble&quot;.[39]","time":1490601560,"resto":118481161,"id":"l2TM5FTz","country":"TR","country_name":"Turkey"},{"no":118488483,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)04:00:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118487250\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118487250<\/a><br><br>Look up the &quot;Revival Process&quot; sometime.

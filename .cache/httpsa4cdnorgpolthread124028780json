For example, north africa had elephants\/tigers and it was almost entirely green. The climate back then favoured a great civilization to arise in these regions. There is a reason why romans were so successful - they lived in the lowlands, not in the mountains, meaning they were well-connected geographically, unlike the greeks.<br><br>Germans, franks, italians and anglos later flourished since they were conquered by the romans, and when the empire collapsed, they adopted the knowledge of the romans, along with their religion and culture. So-called &quot;dark medieval times&quot; were actually a period where monks were translating and rewriting old roman-greek books and storing all the knowledge, making renaissance possible later on. Slavs and scandis on other hand existed outside of roman borders, thus had no access to roman heritage besides just adopting it later through cultural exchange with the germans.<br><br>As climate gradually changed and mediterrean areas became more desert and less green, the cultural centre of the west shifted to northern and eastern areas, until the turks conquered the byzantine and only roman heritage left was in the northern areas like british isles, german areas, netherlands, franks, and to some extent, spanish areas.<br><br>The reason why asians have higher IQ these days is that they have always been industrious and clever people, but also very rigid and stubborn in their following of authority figures and rules, which held back their progress. Once they gained access to western knowledge, they rigorously started adopting this too, which allowed them to reach success.<br><br>Not all people are like this. Western heritage never made some people more advanced, like africans, arabs, hindus etc. who continued their own cultures and merely contributed to the world by working for the westerners, but never truly trying to apply the western model for their societies.","time":1493879526,"resto":124028780,"id":"7B2jmnMT","country":"EE","country_name":"Estonia"},{"no":124030307,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)02:32:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124028780\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124028780<\/a><br>Didn&#039;t you just answer your own question? <br><br>A group in a resource rich environment will do better than one that is in a scarce one. <br><br>Also culture is a huge factor, many don&#039;t realize that it is actually a selector for genetic traits.

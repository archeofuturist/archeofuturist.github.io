This is a giant turn off for normal people and being told &quot;you&#039;re with us or againt us&quot; means that people are going to be silently agaist them.","time":1491729961,"resto":120260812,"id":"9StD7CGe","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120263549,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)05:27:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120261150\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120261150<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;unredeemable, life-defining loss<\/span>","filename":"1455790182608","ext":".jpg","w":200,"h":193,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":120,"tim":1491730025861,"time":1491730025,"md5":"oDvmEiNFka4t8fmdmi0ujQ==","fsize":8170,"resto":120260812,"id":"TrLenM2R","country":"HR","country_name":"Croatia"},{"no":120263560,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)05:27:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120260812\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120260812<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;those brown teeth<\/span>","time":1491730031,"resto":120260812,"id":"Zca3RxP+","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":120263561,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)05:27:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120260812\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120260812<\/a><br><br>Hillary is being investigated by the best brains.

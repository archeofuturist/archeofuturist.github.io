I am curious if anybody has ever attempted to use the UN&#039;s own rules against the UN&#039;s own shock troopers, the SJW&#039;s and their varying affiliated organizations such as &quot;anti-racist action&quot; and &quot;antifa&quot;? I just think it would be perfect if all of these organizations victims actually brought fourth their complaints to the UN, in numbers with all of that juicy evidence. I have a wackload of evidence i have saved in my dealings with them. It is in convenient affidavit form and includes documents, audio, video, etc. I think it would be a wicked hammering of the UN were to not only say something of the scumbaggery of these organizations, but also i think it would be great if the people like me that saved everything, inundate those bureaucrats with all of that evidence which clearly depicts the systemmic abuse of rights they are engaging in all over the world.","filename":"C-KCR2oUIAAHFl2.jpg-large","ext":".jpg","w":1241,"h":989,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":199,"tim":1493494763092,"time":1493494763,"md5":"Jv\/eAAJX44JJlGu8tX9UUw==","fsize":99402,"resto":0,"id":"r\/WMooUj","country":"CA","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"international-covenant-on-civil-and-political","country_name":"Canada","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

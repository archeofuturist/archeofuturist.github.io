She wasn&#039;t really interested, but the dating site hooked them up, and she followed through. I think she believed it would be a culturally enriching experience to go on a date with an Indian. This was about 12 years ago, mind you, so the online dating scene was almost entirely new.<br><br>She got to his place, and he could barely speak english. Instead of taking her out, he ordered a pizza, then got his camera out and started taking pictures of her. They hadn&#039;t even exchanged pleasantries yet, and he&#039;s just taking shots of her from all different angles. She actually let him do it because he didn&#039;t speak the language well, and she figured it was a cultural thing. She was not very smart<br><br>She ate the pizza, and he sat there staring at her, taking a few pics while they talked. Then he just put the camera under the table and continued taking flash photography UNDER THE TABLE. She asked him if he could stop taking pictures, and he pulled her blouse neck outward, stuck the camera down, and took photos of her tits.<br><br>She said bye, and left... Then walked in to work (which was closer to his house than her apartment was), and told me what had just happened. She just sat there while this Indian dude took a bunch of close up flash photographs of her legs, panties, and eventually her tits. All she got out of it was a few slices of pizza.<br><br>This is modern women. They&#039;re fucking retards, and they have no idea that men of different races act entirely different. Here in Seattle, baristas and waitresses who work down at Amazon&#039;s campus have been complaining about stalker-level Indian guys who think white women are easy. Indian dudes are the most perverted fucking weirdos on the planet, and white women can&#039;t bring themselves to address the issue directly.

You&#039;re going to avoid looking at it, thinking about it, and definitely avoid eating it. <br>How are women so surprised when we avoid them like this? Do they not realize how innately boring they are? How annoying it is dealing with their shit?

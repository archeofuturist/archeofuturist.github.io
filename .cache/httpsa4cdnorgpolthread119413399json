Never ever trust a single word he says. He blames americans for feeling out of inner cities and living in white suburbs(racist!), yet he lives in ultra rich, 99% white community in northern Michigan in a $5.2 mil house. He literally advocated that Cuban healthcare is superior to American and totally &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;free&quot;&quot;&quot;, while they don&#039;t have fucking penicillin on Cuba(and of course he had never used Cuban healthcare lmao). He hates Big Pharma, yet invested shitloads of $ into Big Pharma stocks.

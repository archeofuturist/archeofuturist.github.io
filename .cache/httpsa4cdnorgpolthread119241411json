I head of it locally after the election and thought of it as a liberal group therapy session. Then it got the support of the local democrats and grew from about 30 people to over 200 in a short amount of time. Now they&#039;re getting well organized and reaching out to other Indivisible cells throughout the country. This smells of a Soros Opeation. Anyone have any info on these people?","filename":"p-captamerica","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":500,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491164694775,"time":1491164694,"md5":"SxbPSAIDto3HdwM5eEPrlw==","fsize":34609,"resto":0,"id":"3RSJ9UFd","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"indivisible-a-soros-group","country_name":"United States","replies":13,"images":6,"unique_ips":7},{"no":119244256,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)16:50:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"Bump wtf","time":1491166224,"resto":119241411,"id":"zU80I+\/K","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119244641,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)16:54:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"Bumping for curiousity","time":1491166442,"resto":119241411,"id":"htclEcqh","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119246107,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)17:07:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119241411\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119241411<\/a><br>CHECKED<br><br>Yeah I&#039;ve heard of this group before and I have a co-worker involved in it.

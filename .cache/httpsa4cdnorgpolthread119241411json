I head of it locally after the election and thought of it as a liberal group therapy session. Then it got the support of the local democrats and grew from about 30 people to over 200 in a short amount of time. Now they&#039;re getting well organized and reaching out to other Indivisible cells throughout the country. This smells of a Soros Opeation. Anyone have any info on these people?","filename":"p-captamerica","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":500,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491164694775,"time":1491164694,"md5":"SxbPSAIDto3HdwM5eEPrlw==","fsize":34609,"resto":0,"id":"3RSJ9UFd","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"indivisible-a-soros-group","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

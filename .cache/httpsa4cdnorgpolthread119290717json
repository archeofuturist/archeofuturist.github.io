Rick and Morty is &quot;reddit&quot; because it has science &quot;jokes&quot; that are really more like science references that normalfags will have heard from trendy internet videos. The show makes a Schrodinger&#039;s cat reference and all the redditors cream themselves because that&#039;s a thing they&#039;ve heard of before","time":1491197682,"resto":119290717,"id":"bUsKAraR","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119296114,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)01:37:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119295857\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119295857<\/a><br>Futurama has schrodinger cat references as well.

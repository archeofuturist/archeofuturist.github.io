When an object the size of saturn is hit by light from our sun, like any other object, it will cast a shadow. This is mainly due to the fact that saturn&#039;s rings are more densely composed of solid materials compared to the other gas giants rings, which are mostly composed of gasses.","time":1490161470,"resto":117725633,"id":"kU3dLp8N","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

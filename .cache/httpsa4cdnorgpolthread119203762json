If you look closely, you can see that there are two different green colors. The darker is forested area, while the lighter is farmland and agriculture. This isn&#039;t a direct problem to anyone, but then again isn&#039;t it a bit sad that such a beautiful and historically important countryside isn&#039;t what it used to be? Furthermore, most of the forested area is actually &quot;reclaimed forest&quot; meaning that it used to be farmland, but was then made back into a forest. So there is literally zero left of what France used to be, it&#039;s all been cut down and part of it replanted, operating like some shoddy sweatshop in Asia where no concern is given.<br><br>Obviously this doesn&#039;t limit itself to France. Same in Britain, Germany, Italy, and almost everwhere sub-Baltic Europe. Even in the southernmost region of Finland there is almost no forest left.","filename":"deforestation","ext":".png","w":584,"h":523,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":223,"tim":1491142905783,"time":1491142905,"md5":"sCN3XoVymIt3vfVNsW063w==","fsize":761746,"resto":0,"id":"Zr3499Gg","country":"FI","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"deforestation-and-ways-to-combat-it","country_name":"Finland","replies":3,"images":1,"unique_ips":4},{"no":119203984,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)10:24:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119203762\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119203762<\/a><br>dude youre full of shit,<br>since we don&#039;t use wood for ships buildings and fires so much anymore, there is more forest in europe right now, then in roman times.<br><br>srsly","time":1491143051,"resto":119203762,"id":"Ycxh4yWg","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":119204261,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)10:26:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119203762\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119203762<\/a><br>This.

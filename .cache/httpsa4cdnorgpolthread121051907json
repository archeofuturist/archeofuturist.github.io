Wage is the same and it&#039;s illegal to give different wage based on sex or race. Earnings can be different due a myriad of factors that you conveniently leave out. Women tend to work less hours overall due to maternity leaves and just generally prioritize family time over work. Men also work more dangerous jobs such as construction, mining and on oil rigs which pay more because there is not a high demand for that job relative to supply.

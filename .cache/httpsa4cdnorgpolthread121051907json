Wage is the same and it&#039;s illegal to give different wage based on sex or race. Earnings can be different due a myriad of factors that you conveniently leave out. Women tend to work less hours overall due to maternity leaves and just generally prioritize family time over work. Men also work more dangerous jobs such as construction, mining and on oil rigs which pay more because there is not a high demand for that job relative to supply. So in essence, your brain is pulsating because it has been forced to use all three neurons simultaneously to put its &quot;thoughts&quot; into words.","time":1492171623,"resto":121051907,"id":"5ugnfmrO","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121052826,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)08:08:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121052276\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121052276<\/a><br>would rather fuck the fox","time":1492171699,"resto":121051907,"id":"UtOBsxXo","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":121053191,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)08:12:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121051907\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121051907<\/a><br>literally proving it&#039;s not for the same job, thanks<br><br>you can do the same with different races, age groups, states, sectors and find even bigger gaps","time":1492171956,"resto":121051907,"id":"Fr7ivaqj","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":121053327,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)08:14:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121051907\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121051907<\/a><br>Obviously men are going to make more money overall, they are genetically predispositions a to being breadwinners it&#039;s in their blood.

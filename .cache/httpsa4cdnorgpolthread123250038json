The issue is how degenerate and unruly a woman becomes who spends the majority of her time in a male dominated work place with chads. The problems arise when your wife is constantly second guessing you as a strong man because she is in the company of stronger and more successful amoral chads. The problem occurs given that a large number of women are not red-pilled and secure enough in themselves and their partners to fight it and thus succumb to the blue-pilled degeneracy. The problem arises when that degeneracy leaves the workplace and now infects your home and your kids. It would be great if women focused on raising and maintaining the children of our future. However, the illusory concept of independence appealed to a large number of them. Now we have degenerate niggerish children, households are actually pulling in less effective income with dual earners, and the very fabric of the household is undermined by lawless chads at the top of the pyramid. <br><br>Everything seems a shit load better when you fail to see what&#039;s really going on.","time":1493419792,"resto":123250038,"id":"VkmMyK6H","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123258722,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)18:50:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123255446\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123255446<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; if I marry one there&#039;s less potential for alimony right?<\/span><br><br>Wrong<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Do courts still order men to pay alimony even if they make less?

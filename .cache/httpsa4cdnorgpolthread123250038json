The issue is how degenerate and unruly a woman becomes who spends the majority of her time in a male dominated work place with chads. The problems arise when your wife is constantly second guessing you as a strong man because she is in the company of stronger and more successful amoral chads. The problem occurs given that a large number of women are not red-pilled and secure enough in themselves and their partners to fight it and thus succumb to the blue-pilled degeneracy. The problem arises when that degeneracy leaves the workplace and now infects your home and your kids. It would be great if women focused on raising and maintaining the children of our future. However, the illusory concept of independence appealed to a large number of them. Now we have degenerate niggerish children, households are actually pulling in less effective income with dual earners, and the very fabric of the household is undermined by lawless chads at the top of the pyramid. <br><br>Everything seems a shit load better when you fail to see what&#039;s really going on.","time":1493419792,"resto":123250038,"id":"VkmMyK6H","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123258722,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)18:50:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123255446\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123255446<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; if I marry one there&#039;s less potential for alimony right?<\/span><br><br>Wrong<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Do courts still order men to pay alimony even if they make less?

For example at microsoft, we have to do 2 &quot;connects&quot; per year (a kind of 1 on 1 meeting with a superior). We have to describe not what we&#039;ve done, what we&#039;re working on and how to improve in that department, but rather what business impact we&#039;ve had, and how we can align better to microsoft&#039;s business goals.<br>This kind of attitude means that instead of fixing all the broken crapware at microsoft, engineers have to work on 200% pointless bullshit that sells on lies, hype and cluelessness (right now, it&#039;s dysfunctional cloud crap and rule-based AI that&#039;s literally a bunch of regex and templates so bad it hurts, advertised as software that can do actual reasoning).<br>Because of this, the only reason employees stay on board is the money.<br>And yes, the h1b shit is core to the $$$ strategy here and there are pajeets everywhere.<br>However, the (real) research departments are composed of some leaders in the field and the requirements to join are very high.

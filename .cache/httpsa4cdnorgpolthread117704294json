There are red colors and there are blue colors, the exact bounds of which are debatable. Just like with racial theory, hence the Slavs aren&#039;t white bull shit. But to deny the concept of the white, Asian, or African race, however blurry their exact boundaries, is lunacy. If you want to play that game; then there is no such thing as a species, which fun fact, isn&#039;t a clearly defined natural phenomenon, but in fact, a social construct. The entire taxinomical system is a man made structure that loosely defines real world truths.

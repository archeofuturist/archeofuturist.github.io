This must be bait. I never said felony murder was different because he was in a car. You said he was &quot;in proximity&quot; but he wasn&#039;t. He was an accomplice once he defied a lawful order, got into a car, tried to flee and evade while his friend tried to run a cop over. You can&#039;t be this stupid. You are no longer just &quot;in proximity&quot; when you willfully enter a fucking car that your friend is using to flee and evade with you and run a cop over.","filename":"5e0","ext":".jpg","w":220,"h":255,"tn_w":107,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493676870722,"time":1493676870,"md5":"8+DgzvE6fIPYvagwj6VddA==","fsize":9473,"resto":123666727,"id":"Idd4rnVa","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123681727,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)18:15:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123666727\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123666727<\/a><br>Grew up in Balch Springs.

A striking reference to that conclusion, notable for its confidence and the policy prescriptions that accompany it, appears in a classified FBI Counterterrorism Policy Guide from April 2015, obtained by The Intercept. The guide, which details the process by which the FBI enters individuals on a terrorism watchlist, the Known or Suspected Terrorist File, notes that \u201cdomestic terrorism investigations focused on militia extremists, white supremacist extremists, and sovereign citizen extremists often have identified active links to law enforcement officers,\u201d and explains in some detail how bureau policies have been crafted to take this infiltration into account.<br><br>Although these right-wing extremists have posed a growing threat for years, federal investigators have been reluctant to publicly address that threat or to point out the movement\u2019s longstanding strategy of infiltrating the law enforcement community.<br><br>No centralized recruitment process or set of national standards exists for the 18,000 law enforcement agencies in the United States, many of which have deep historical connections to racist ideologies. As a result, state and local police as well as sheriff\u2019s departments present ample opportunities for white supremacists and other right-wing extremists looking to expand their power base.&quot;<br><br>Report: FBI Finds White Supremacists Infiltrated Law Enforcement Agencies<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;http:\/\/talkingpointsmemo.com\/livew<wbr>ire\/law-enforcement-agencies-infilt<wbr>rated-white-supremacists-extremists<wbr><\/span>","time":1493682008,"resto":123666727,"id":"7WXGQz5L","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123692244,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)19:40:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123691468\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123691468<\/a><br><br>Where the fuck do you think you are?

The guide, which details the process by which the FBI enters individuals on a terrorism watchlist, the Known or Suspected Terrorist File, notes that \u201cdomestic terrorism investigations focused on militia extremists, white supremacist extremists, and sovereign citizen extremists often have identified active links to law enforcement officers,\u201d and explains in some detail how bureau policies have been crafted to take this infiltration into account.<br><br>Although these right-wing extremists have posed a growing threat for years, federal investigators have been reluctant to publicly address that threat or to point out the movement\u2019s longstanding strategy of infiltrating the law enforcement community.<br><br>No centralized recruitment process or set of national standards exists for the 18,000 law enforcement agencies in the United States, many of which have deep historical connections to racist ideologies.

Today (and going forward), however, young people can choose to discuss their beliefs only with others who think the same way, which not only fortifies their convictions, but as we&#039;re seeing right now, can lead them to cultivate their entire adult identity with these convictions at the center.<br><br>Consequently, for a typical SJW to confront the notion of doubt in their convictions isn&#039;t as innocuous as &quot;getting wiser with age,&quot; it&#039;s a confrontation of the validity of his or her (or ze or zir or zem) entire conception of personal identity, which obviously can be a terrifying prospect. It&#039;d be much easier and enticing to recede back into one&#039;s echo chamber.<br><br>Another contributing factor is that these beliefs aren&#039;t coming exclusively from MSM and each other, but also very crucially from their humanities professors, who they&#039;ve been conditioned to regard as possibly the most trustworthy intellectual authorities in their lives.<br><br>So what do you guys think? Will the SJW movement still be around, say, 10 years from now? If so, will it have faded considerably? or will it be stronger than ever?","filename":"fatty pig fatso SJW","ext":".jpg","w":712,"h":612,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":214,"tim":1491372466633,"time":1491372466,"md5":"CODYuM85+QKPgfFewvBTPg==","fsize":81540,"resto":0,"id":"6Vk\/2y4i","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-future-of-pcoutrage-culture","country_name":"United States","replies":7,"images":0,"unique_ips":5},{"no":119576342,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)02:19:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"I believe that SJWs will die like a dog very soon like dam daniel and the catch me outside thing did and the best way to speed up the death is to ignore them.

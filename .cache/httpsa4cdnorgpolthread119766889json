Cities like Limerick are largely impoverished because no one wants to develop a City that hates itself and wont look after itself. The backwards law of the land is, as long as the GAA is happy then &quot;its grand&quot;. Its not grand. We need to start cleaning up the area outside our homes, decrease noise and light pollution, communicate with one another, penalise landlords who refuse to cap rents. Cap rates on small businesses. Say hello to our neighbours and help them. If we want Ireland to change it literally starts with the person living beside you. <br><br>We don&#039;t need anymore pubs, chemists, bookies, river Islands, and beauty salons. And those who think that pumping a town with shit outsourced businesses - should be met with hostility and penalised. <br>Ireland cant float its economy on a few hundred jobs at Apple and Yahoo in Dublin - They must pay their taxes or fuck off and let new business grow.<br><br>Most important is our food and water systems need a complete restructuring. Irish people are experiencing massive depression and anxiety and just take a look at what they are eating and drinking. <br><br>We have incredible land, produce, and fisheries here and we are exporting it all out of the country.<br>We need to support local farming and urban farming start ups.<br>Our Seas, Rivers and Streams are overflowing with fish that the Irish refuse to make apart of their diet. Its so sad we pay money to eat skinless and boneless salmon from an industrial farm in Scotland, or Northern Europe. We allow Portuguese &amp; Spaniards to take Irish west coast fishing back to Spain &amp; Portugal (and then they receive international awards for having the greatest seafood).","filename":"1491192808417","ext":".gif","w":280,"h":302,"tn_w":115,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491505771521,"time":1491505771,"md5":"E4mAJhARcqr6jBrQkKi8oQ==","fsize":3929036,"resto":119766889,"id":"Ecywsx7L","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"},{"no":119779616,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)15:13:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119778292\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119778292<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The government are lying about the number of muslims here.<\/span><br>Fucking globalists are doing this everywhere and lying about it.<br>I love you Ireland.<br>Please don&#039;t ever change.","time":1491506032,"resto":119766889,"id":"wAH+Hxpc","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

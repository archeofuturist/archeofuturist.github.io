I think the fake news media has a huge part to play in this. I mean let&#039;s just be honest here, folks. Trump is a self-made billionaire who made his fortune using nothing but hard work and a small loan of a million dollars which he paid back with interest. He&#039;s the classiest president in history and he consistently makes good decisions without anybody&#039;s help. That&#039;s the sign of a true leader.<br><br>Have you seen the news lately? He&#039;s increasing defense spending which is a sign of a prosperous nation. America&#039;s no longer gonna use those old shitty nuclear warheads they&#039;ve stockpiled over the decades and instead they&#039;re gonna make them tip-top and ready to fire them at any nation that gets in their way.<br><br>Only braindead individuals and leftwing cucks are against such a forward thinking president.","time":1490077108,"resto":117593392,"id":"8RpVSp0i","country":"IN","country_name":"India"},{"no":117598143,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)02:43:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117593650\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117593650<\/a><br><a href=\"#p117593666\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117593666<\/a><br>Their methodology is more than likely flawed if all they&#039;re saying is &quot;1,500 national adults via telephone&quot;","time":1490078609,"resto":117593392,"id":"w6k0m8sO","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

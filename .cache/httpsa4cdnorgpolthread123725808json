I&#039;m black and hate being lumped in with niggers. My grandfather passed away almost 3 years ago now, and my grandmother is probably not far off too now. I have all this stress, and feel like I will definitely kill myself at some point when I&#039;m older but I still don&#039;t get the urge to drink alcohol or get drunk... I know what it&#039;s like to be buzzed and shit faced. I&#039;ve done it before, mostly under pressure from a relative who saw drinking together as some kind of manly bonding thing, but aside from that it never became a habit for me. I dropped it not long after he moved away and haven&#039;t had a beer or wine in 2 years. How the fuck do people get hooked on this shit? It doesn&#039;t even taste good, and the after taste is even worse. The buzz is kind of trippy I guess, but it ain&#039;t really all that great... certainly not great enough to continuously spend loads of money on it, even on the cheap 211&#039;s I used to drink.","filename":"1493667383982","ext":".jpg","w":900,"h":1200,"tn_w":93,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493702032469,"time":1493702032,"md5":"lwCUrwN0hv8d+fSo36WdCQ==","fsize":274915,"resto":123725808,"id":"6VES407I","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"}]}

My great-great-great grandmother on my mother&#039;s side (direct female) was variously called Jewish, Mexican, 100% full-blooded Choctaw Indian, and Italian. No one alive at that point had ever seen her in person and there are no surviving photos (this is bumfuck Alabama we&#039;re talking about here). This got really heated between my grandmother and others in her generation who were just going by what long dead relatives told them about her.<br><br>My mother did detailed research online and believes she found the answer.

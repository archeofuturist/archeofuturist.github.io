Look up &quot;argumentation ethics&quot;. His theory doesn&#039;t justify complete self-ownership, it doesn&#039;t justify pre-existing rights (as in refusal to engage in argumentation), it doesn&#039;t justify a limitation to human self-ownership to the exclusion of animal self-ownership (equally extended to mentally incapable humans, infants, etc), and much of his line of reasoning falls on its own premises in the sense that logically consistent rejections of self-ownership can be made. And since Hoppe is unable to actually DERIVE his conclusion of self-ownership from argumentation alone, means that he&#039;s imposing a moral system in which property rights and right to life are &quot;universal&quot;. If a moral system can be imposed, the any moral system can be imposed regardless of its qualities. For example, I could say that since morality is entirely subjective, property rights don&#039;t exist, and a right to life does not exist -- meaning I could kill you, enslave you or steal all your &quot;property&quot; and protect it as my own as long as I&#039;m physically stronger than you and capable of doing so. If you ARGUE against the morality of doing so, you&#039;re imposing a moral system which runs contrary to the entire philosophy of Hoppe in the first place.<br><br>Overall it&#039;s just a mess of premises and conclusions taken out of nowhere, rammed into a Libertarian ideological framework.","time":1490824807,"resto":118837555,"id":"ZB5m8cIt","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":118842068,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)18:14:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118837555\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118837555<\/a><br><a href=\"#p118838372\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118838372<\/a><br><a href=\"#p118840464\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118840464<\/a>","filename":"Redpill","ext":".jpg","w":334,"h":499,"tn_w":83,"tn_h":124,"tim":1490825644525,"time":1490825644,"md5":"wbE7OFs8P1SXwC88JdBKgw==","fsize":27207,"resto":118837555,"id":"87C8um1V","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":118843119,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)18:23:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118840464\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118840464<\/a><br>Thanks.","time":1490826223,"resto":118837555,"id":"sYM4wQZe","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":118843564,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)18:27:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118837994\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118837994<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;tfw when you will never have a badass warrior king again<\/span>","filename":"1455156161","ext":".jpg","w":300,"h":300,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490826474126,"time":1490826474,"md5":"Ekmwi38X\/wfCm0H\/qm35mQ==","fsize":21542,"resto":118837555,"id":"Jt5jic1M","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"}]}

At the Third Battle of Berkeley, pro-white groups were instrumental in beating back Antifa. However, we lacked organization and a consistent uniform. This is where the idea of the Blueshirts comes in. We are trying to create cooperation and organization between various pro-white groups to engage in street activism.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What are our goals?<\/span><br>As previously stated we want to create cooperation and a universal uniform for pro-white groups. The uniform will help reduce friendly fire, and create a distinct, professional appearance. It will also help with recognition of the Alt Right&#039;s role. Ultimately, we are trying to get to organizational capacity that is currently lacking. Right now, the Blueshirts is essentially just a uniform and a set of rules. Currently we plan for social media presence and hopefully a website in the near future. In the present, we hope pro-white groups and individuals take up this idea.<br>RULES AND GUIDELINES:<br>1.

This means to maintain a uniform appearance with other local Blueshirts. It also means to be in decent physical condition. If you are too fat or skinny just don&#039;t wear the uniform. In addition to decent fitness, it is important to be well groomed. Do not have poor facial hair or hair cut. No piercings. Try to avoid having no hair if possible because we don&#039;t want to look like skinheads. If you are a skinhead wear a black hat of some kind. Be friendly to law enforcement, but keep in mind that their hands are tied to the local government. Do not rely on them. Know your local laws and abide by them, especially when it comes to weapons. Avoid being overly memey as we hope to cultivate a more serious appearance. Never start a confrontation, but do not back down if attacked. Avoid racial slurs because average people will immediately form a negative opinion of you and the organization. Avoid roman salutes for the same reason. In short, be friendly, professional, and well spoken. If you cannot do those things, don&#039;t wear the uniform.","filename":"Blueshirt","ext":".png","w":362,"h":547,"tn_w":82,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493250121372,"time":1493250121,"md5":"F4QgD\/E+R5ol9A\/U0LvrpQ==","fsize":24408,"resto":122959165,"id":"bFPh0RRW","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122959321,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)19:42:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"UNIFORM:<br>The uniform is a light blue, button up, collared shirt with a black tie (wear a clip on so you don&#039;t get strangled) tucked into the shirt. The pants will be black cargo pants tucked into black combat boots (the boots in the picture are black, they are just old, I have since polished them), preferably steel toed. A black baseball helmet will be the ideal headgear, but feel free to coordinate with others to have a different matching black helmet. Ideally, stay away from face masks, but if you have to wear one, wear a skull mask one like some of the Identity Evropa guys did at Berkeley. Mounting a grinder&#039;s mask on a helmet is a good idea, as are gloves for situations where scuffles with antifa will be inevitable. Coordinate any additional protection with others in your area, but try to keep it black. Modifying the uniform slightly is fine but stay with the long sleeve blue button up. Uniformity at events will be very important. Don&#039;t wear anything associated with the 3rd Reich or Neo-Nazis. This includes, but is not limited to swastikas, stahlhelms, jackboots, sam browne belts, SS runes, sun wheels, black suns, or anything else that fits on the stereotypical &#039;Neo-Nazi&#039; and\/or makes you look like you&#039;re larping as the SA. Similarly, stay away from stuff like suspenders or colored laces. We want to create distance from ourselves and those movements because society has hard set notions on those. That being said do not be afraid to speak the truth on politically incorrect topics.","filename":"Blueshirts_Uniform1","ext":".jpg","w":179,"h":429,"tn_w":52,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493250156440,"time":1493250156,"md5":"G\/jo8f5n8TfEqKqqBU8Zkw==","fsize":9401,"resto":122959165,"id":"bFPh0RRW","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122959408,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)19:43:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"WHO THIS MOVEMENT IS FOR:<br>1.

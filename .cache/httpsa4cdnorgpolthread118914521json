Jean Claude Junker just admitted to having been in contact with alien species concerning the fall of the EU. Info from military leaks seems to show that the US has signed a treaty with an alien race called the J-Rod species (named after the symbol written by the first alien member of this group that talked with the airforce). There seem to be at least 4 alien races that we currently are aware of, but estimate that there are upwards of 20 species that actually visit the earth. This would account for the wide variety of craft seen in the sky. Military leaks also seem to indicate that the US is in possession of one of the J-rod spaceships. <br><br><br>Let&#039;s assume all of this is true, for the sake of arguing, how is the USA going to respond to an alien invasion? At the moment, I feel like we are sitting ducks. What tech can we possibly use to counter beings that can use warp drive? How will we unite as a species to face this threat, if that&#039;s even possible?","filename":"1488046199715","ext":".jpg","w":236,"h":261,"tn_w":226,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490875446547,"time":1490875446,"md5":"1WhHDAhEqeE0tRKFlWmhjQ==","fsize":17766,"resto":0,"id":"nGe8paOX","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"lets-talk-about-exopolitics-pol-how-is-the-world","country_name":"United States","replies":5,"images":1,"unique_ips":6},{"no":118914582,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)08:05:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118914521\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118914521<\/a><br>aliens are demons\/homoculi that live in caves under earth, all life comes from earth","time":1490875516,"resto":118914521,"id":"quSGx6Qw","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118914651,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)08:06:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118914521\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118914521<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Jean Claude Junker just admitted to having been in contact with alien species concerning the fall of the EU<\/span><br>Wait what?","time":1490875582,"resto":118914521,"id":"OMbXvlbw","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":118914664,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)08:06:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118914521\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118914521<\/a><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/3mLt55R67D0","time":1490875591,"resto":118914521,"id":"7ni8USAR","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118914700,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)08:07:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"We won&#039;t have to worry about aliens, humans are doing a good enough job at destroying ourselves.

The 1st passenger said &quot;I am Stephen Curry, the best NBA basketball player. The Warriors and my millions of fans need me, and I can&#039;t afford to die.&quot; So he took the 1st pack and left the plane. The 2nd passenger, Donald Trump, said, &quot;I am the newly-elected US President, and I am the smartest President in American history, so my people don&#039;t want me to die.&quot; He took the 2nd pack and jumped out of the plane. The 3rd passenger, the Pope, said to the 4th passenger, a 10 year old schoolboy, &quot;My son, I am old and don&#039;t have many years left, you have more years ahead so I will sacrifice my life and let you have the last parachute.&quot; The little boy said, &quot;That&#039;s okay, Your Holiness, there&#039;s a parachute left for you. America &#039;s smartest President took my schoolbag.&quot;","filename":"Crew sample-05(rename before posting)","ext":".jpg","w":770,"h":470,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":152,"tim":1490680590675,"time":1490680590,"md5":"HAaBqX\/q+Pb\/EMcZD7kCZQ==","fsize":39685,"resto":0,"id":"Y4RGhM6Z","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"an-airplane-was-about-to-crash-there-were-4","country_name":"Canada","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":118618552,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)01:58:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"Liberals like the pope now because he&#039;s a pedo globalist.","time":1490680697,"resto":118618391,"id":"tiil+bYK","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]}

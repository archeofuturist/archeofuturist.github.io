The small town I grew up in is about 50 percent black and 50 percent white, and the high school I went to was around the same percentages. What I found absolutely fascinating is that for the most part, tight knit friend groups were mostly segregated, you hung out with your own race, yet everybody was cool with each other. White jokes and black jokes were thrown around at each other and everyone had a good laugh. Normal stereotypical jokes such as blacks can&#039;t swim, they steal, calling them colored people, and white people can&#039;t dance, can&#039;t cook, white trash, was just normal conversation. Some of my favorite people from high school were black and such.<br><br>I move on to the state university, and all of a sudden the white people are bad, even whites are telling me that we have done wrong, and that rednecks are the most racist people. Basically anybody, black or white, that grew up with any sort of money was quick to say that racism is still alive and every white person is racist.<br><br>Over the summers when I went back home, I worked fast food just for spending cash for booze and weed basically, and it was just so different because everybody called each other nigga, regardless of race. Of course it was mostly filled with low IQ people, but it was fun, and I am plagued with the normie sense of humor, so it was hilarious to me.<br><br>So, all of that being said, the election comes up, and all of the blacks from my high school that&#039;s I&#039;m friends with on facebook are sharing normie Trump memes, talking about how black lives matter is bullshit, and saying if you work fast food, don&#039;t ask for $15 minimum wage because your skill set isn&#039;t worth that much.<br><br>So what exactly is it about being poor that makes you redpilled? Why are what are considered the smartest of people, college students, so bluepilled? Even the STEM professors I studied under were seriously liberal and were seriously pro-Obama during the 2012 election.","filename":"1455624177333","ext":".webm","w":480,"h":270,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1490357855493,"time":1490357855,"md5":"L9burKgNx8wQBX0NABOVyg==","fsize":2805440,"resto":0,"id":"hTZyIZ5r","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"so-pol-i-grew-up-in-a-southern-state-out-in-the","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":118075104,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)08:22:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118074737\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118074737<\/a><br>It&#039;s because they are self-righteous degenerates.","time":1490358139,"resto":118074737,"id":"3QM83Xoe","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

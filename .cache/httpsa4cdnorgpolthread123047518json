This is very difficult with the colonial legacy attached to the British identity.<br><br>Similarly with the US: when anyone can be an American, no one really is. If you make the criteria so broad then it effectively becomes meaningless.<br><br>Also, the fact that the US has become the main enforcer of globalism and multiculturalism worldwide. It promulgates it&#039;s degenerate culture\/worldview and enforces the stagnant destructive status quo of liberal democracy by increasingly erratic means.<br><br>tldr; allied powers are too far gone to be salvaged. Cultural rot from the sixties has irrevocably ruined them.","filename":"image","ext":".jpg","w":850,"h":400,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":117,"tim":1493306962843,"time":1493306962,"md5":"JiNNfU79sHQJBkpp79Dv7A==","fsize":94928,"resto":0,"id":"c0LTk5MU","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"fragmentation-of-degenerate-powers","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

It said that would be the largest dismissal of criminal convictions in U.S. history.<br><br>The cases would be formally dismissed by court action, expected Thursday, the ACLU said.<br><br>Dookhan pleaded guilty in 2013 to obstruction of justice, perjury and tampering with evidence after being accused of falsifying her work as far back as 2004. She was sentenced to three years in prison and was paroled last year.<br><br>Many of the drug case defendants have already completed their sentences, though some probably remain in prison because of other charges not contaminated by the lab scandal. About 2,000 cases had been resolved before Tuesday.<br><br>Prosecutors said Dookhan admitted testing only a fraction of a batch of samples, then listing them all as positive for illegal drugs. Her motive, they said, was to boost her productivity and burnish her reputation.<br><br>For those who have completed their sentences, wiping away their convictions will help them in other ways, such as employment, housing or immigration status, said Daniel Marx, an attorney who argued for the dismissals.","filename":"AnnieDookhan","ext":".jpg","w":1200,"h":801,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1492621133266,"time":1492621133,"md5":"Vk2P65aS6srhfyh5xIN57w==","fsize":90643,"resto":0,"id":"Y5crK7mD","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"21000-drug-convictions-to-be-thrown-out-after","country_name":"United States","replies":12,"images":1,"unique_ips":10},{"no":121865670,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)12:59:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121865549\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121865549<\/a><br>she had a lesbian lover she gave the drugs to and they got high on coke and heroin and scissored.<br>Is this really a surprise to anyone?","time":1492621197,"resto":121865549,"id":"CWypaeZy","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121865860,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)13:01:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121865670\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121865670<\/a><br>link?","time":1492621299,"resto":121865549,"id":"Y5crK7mD","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121866191,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)13:04:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121865549\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121865549<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;She was sentenced to three years in prison and was paroled last year.<\/span><br>What the actual fuck?<br><br>What in the name of fuck?

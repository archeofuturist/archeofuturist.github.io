Or perhaps schools should have after-school music lessons for a standard fee. All students should learn how to play an instrument by the time they&#039;re in middle school .Learning an instrument increases IQ by 4 points and teaches discipline. Also, the reason modern music gone to shit is because parents arent teaching their kids music and so they don&#039;t learn to appreciate folk, blues or classical music and they get hooked on to shitty trap and hip hip music . Most of the greatest Rock stars were classically trained musicians.","filename":"5720983475982435","ext":".jpg","w":253,"h":344,"tn_w":183,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492223514583,"time":1492223514,"md5":"lTn9a\/EZz96ATHJ7p88Elg==","fsize":79769,"resto":0,"id":"rOEmN1gT","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"school-should-replace-worthless-art-classes-with","country_name":"United States","replies":6,"images":0,"unique_ips":6},{"no":121155594,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)22:33:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;implying electives should have ever been considered <\/span><br><br>Saged<br><br>OPs a band geek","time":1492223620,"resto":121155356,"id":"bHUVwZP7","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121156146,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)22:38:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121155356\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121155356<\/a><br>I&#039;m a classically trained musician.

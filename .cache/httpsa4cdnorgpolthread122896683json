Another can be national socialist, another can be libertarian, etc.<br>And when it comes down to it, how would you enforce a singular gouverning system on 40 different planets that are lightyears apart? Babylon 5 does a nice job of it by ethnically separating cultures and gouvernments and showing how terrible things go if you take Earth&#039;s diversity and colonise Mars with it. <br><br>Freedom is the only way.

Aren&#039;t both superceding institutions on popular writ that mimics monarchism of the ancien regime but without the stability of normalized succession? Both rely totally on the personality and soul of the leading figure as an avatar of general will, with lip service to basically liberal commitments, and a presidency that will leave its successors fighting for the legitimacy their predecessor enjoyed.","filename":"9dLB6NS","ext":".png","w":1200,"h":750,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":156,"tim":1490841689364,"time":1490841689,"md5":"DVByCItpAuvKNOt2DUURgA==","fsize":74386,"resto":0,"id":"oKYzBDaK","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"what-makes-puntinism-distinct-from-the","country_name":"United States","replies":5,"images":1,"unique_ips":4},{"no":118871160,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)22:43:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118870990\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118870990<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;and a presidency that will leave its successors fighting for the legitimacy their predecessor enjoyed.<\/span><br><br>If the leader got rid of the niggers, it&#039;ll probably work out fine.","time":1490841785,"resto":118870990,"id":"pVO\/sVb9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118871916,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)22:49:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118870990\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118870990<\/a><br>Probably the most well-written OP i&#039;ve seen in some time, burger. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;distinct from the Bonepartism neoreactionaries decry so often?<\/span><br>This may be somewhat of a strawman though, and i feel like &quot;neo reactionary&quot; is an oxymoron at best. The difference may lie simply in the illusion of democracy - something present in Putinist Russia but obviously absent in the essentially autocratic regime which was Napoleon&#039;s France. Byt yeah, any system that is built on the cult of personality is destined to crumble (there may be some delay) once said individual is no longer leading, for instance in the case of Atilla&#039;s empire, etc etc. That being said, the anthropocentric nature of politics (a single individual representing a party or political paradigm) is also applicable to our liberal democracies - we can see how the DNC went into disarray once their nog figurehead stepped away from the seat of power.","time":1490842194,"resto":118870990,"id":"t6tVOvTR","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118873209,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)23:01:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118871916\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118871916<\/a><br>your response demonstrated no familiarity with the neoreactionary philosophers commonly discussed here (Moldbug, Land, Anissimov) that I was trying to broach, a weirdly oblivious lack of understanding of Napoleonic France, which had far more democratic character than the RF, and veers off into irrelevance as plainly as any college freshman&#039;s paper.<br><br>readmoar, and don&#039;t take that personally, I just needed to bump the thread","filename":"spoogs","ext":".png","w":700,"h":419,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":74,"tim":1490842891888,"time":1490842891,"md5":"bOa1quTuGJaTXFLBhRRFsA==","fsize":53510,"resto":118870990,"id":"oKYzBDaK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118873678,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)23:06:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118873209\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118873209<\/a><br>first, nobody discusses neoreactionism here. second, do neoreactionaries really think Putin is great or something? it does seem like Bonapartism to me.

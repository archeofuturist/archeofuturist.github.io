But that last option never works because people here operate on logic, sure there might be a leap of faith or two here and there once in a while. But you can&#039;t argue that all races are the same then pull the bell curve out or crime rates based on race.<br><br>This is the one thing the media simply doesn&#039;t get nor understand. We all operate on sheer logic, things are straight forward to us. Penis means you&#039;re male, vagina female. Blacks have lower average IQ and commit more crime. These are simple truths they push from their minds, but the moment they deal with us in any sort of space they have to confront these ideas which they label racist or transphobic. This is also why our memes work, because they all have that grain of truth that everyone knows is truth, but most would never admit in a public or on social media. \/pol\/ has become a redpill machine as people say, while we may be divided on our beliefs, the one thing everyone here holds dearest is the truth.","filename":"1493005537465","ext":".jpg","w":800,"h":600,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1493692067253,"time":1493692067,"md5":"rxmYF9xElTf520JpDU2\/1Q==","fsize":108651,"resto":123701555,"id":"Ud0\/4pfU","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123712628,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)22:27:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123701555\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123701555<\/a><br>Fuck Samantha Bee.<br><br>I can&#039;t believe she said this shit, either.","filename":"SamanthaBee","ext":".png","w":648,"h":497,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":95,"tim":1493692073570,"time":1493692073,"md5":"PU5dvanWhjH8h3l0UpR1Vw==","fsize":486203,"resto":123701555,"id":"2ktyh+m\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123712655,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)22:28:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123710589\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123710589<\/a><br><br>I always check.

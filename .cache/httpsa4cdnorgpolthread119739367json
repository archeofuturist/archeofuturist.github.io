Mine was different, though - especially in politics. One of our female teachers kept claiming how perfect our current political system is (and how business-lobbyism is important for democracy for some reason?) - if you dared criticize the state or one of its institutions in any way, she would get really angry over it. History was similar - we covered the &quot;third reich&quot;-topic at least in 3 different school years - every time the teachers would go on about how we are all responsible for what some other Germans did in the past etc. - sure, you were &quot;free to make your own opinion&quot;, but only if you were able to withstand the political and ideological positions that teachers are supposed to imprint on their students. I only had one good teacher in politics who - when discussing political topics - didn&#039;t try to influence our opinion, and actually told us that what he was doing at times (not praising and even criticizing EU, UN and German State decisions) would easily get him fired if people in the &#039;Kultusministerium&#039; found out about it, so he asked us not tell anyone. You could have whatever opinion you liked in his class; only when it came to exams was when he couldn&#039;t accept every opinion - since others could see those opinions as well, and officially accepting &quot;unpopular opinions&quot; of some students might have led to him being fired as well.","time":1491485376,"resto":119739367,"id":"uFWbdKTE","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":119742392,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)09:29:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119740690\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119740690<\/a><br>I&#039;m sure they are taught its bad and they should feel bad about it","filename":"1491105324871","ext":".jpg","w":680,"h":505,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":92,"tim":1491485377784,"time":1491485377,"md5":"dn85yPMxyph+5ElGXyjh8w==","fsize":45431,"resto":119739367,"id":"oiW1Vzn5","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119742887,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)09:35:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"there&#039;s plenty of children and grandchildren of actual nazis who hold the same\/similar views as their parents\/grandparents but they usually keep low profiles.","time":1491485727,"resto":119739367,"id":"88LfYyuh","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":119743222,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)09:39:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119742392\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119742392<\/a><br>This<br><br>It&#039;s definitely not just &#039;&#039;heres a part of history&#039;&#039; it&#039;s probably about how evil German people are, and how they should feel bad and allow someone brown\/black to rape and behead them","time":1491485983,"resto":119739367,"id":"STai1TxF","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119743733,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)09:45:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119743222\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119743222<\/a><br>What about all the Muslim kids in these schools?

That is all the world and society consists of. Yeah, there is nature, what little of it is left. But besides nature the only thing there is, is materialism and money. What the f*#k is the point? I don&#039;t understand it. There is no meaning or purpose. It is f*cking retarded! What does life consist of, besides materialism and money? Tell me the meaning of this! And don&#039;t say god, because god has clearly left the building.<br><br>Machines can make our food, machines can do pretty much everything. Land is not even scarce; we can live on the water, Water World style, except more modern. Our possibilities our endless, the dark ages are behind us. Money is what is holding us back, not what is technologically feasible We eat shit, we live meaningless lives, we do pointless drugs like alcohol and stare at screens to keep us entertained so we keep going to our stupid pointless jobs<br><br>Why should I have to do some meaningless shit 40 hours a week just to survive? Haven&#039;t we progressed passed this! It&#039;s 2016! Like I don&#039;t even understand this. It&#039;s 2016! Why is this shit even necessary with the state of technology and shit, with what is actually feasible. We should be exploring Space together, fuck money! Makes me depressed!<br><br>I don&#039;t have much to lose if the world collapses.<br>Honestly my life has no meaning and i&#039;m just tired of planet Earth. <br><br>The story of humanity has lead nowhere but down, there hasn&#039;t been any real progress<br>since the moon landing. Since then it&#039;s just been a fuckfest of media, facebook, whores and greed.","filename":"1470823312839","ext":".jpg","w":595,"h":595,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492688688158,"time":1492688688,"md5":"pYAiKYwcub0tw0Q6\/ftRzw==","fsize":176038,"resto":0,"id":"ohN84k5a","country":"DK","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"i-hate-what-society-is-based-off-of-materialism","country_name":"Denmark","replies":3,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":121986242,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)07:45:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"Are you cute","time":1492688738,"resto":121986164,"id":"RT2jU9PD","country":"NZ","country_name":"New Zealand"},{"no":121986317,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)07:46:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"edit it&#039;s 2017","time":1492688785,"resto":121986164,"id":"ohN84k5a","country":"DK","country_name":"Denmark"},{"no":121986680,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)07:50:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"H\u00e4ng dig greken","time":1492689051,"resto":121986164,"id":"86fK4fph","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"}]}

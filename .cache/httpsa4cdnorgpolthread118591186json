He responded to my shit post and attached a bunch of reading materials and I spent a few hours reading through it all. I finally understand why Trump supporters are fighting to get things changed... you guys and girls are fighting because we can&#039;t afford the same bullshit over and over again and even though I might not really feel %100 confident in Trump because I just feel he&#039;s not totally honest about everything, it&#039;s more of the goals and actionable path that this administration is taking away from the same old song and dance, it&#039;s the overall message to the world and not necessarily just Trump... I just want to say that I&#039;m sorry for the shit posts and the nonsense (even though you wouldn&#039;t know me or care to know me anyway). This anon told me he was a US army officer but I didn&#039;t get a chance to say thanks because after an Australian anon and he turned the thread into a redpill thread, it was deleted (odd). You know, even though Reddit is annoying %99 of the time and heavily influenced on the liberal side, I apologized to the mods of The Donald and they muted me (since I was already banned. I was kind of hoping I could contribute some because it&#039;s the message that&#039;s important, not necessarily the person. In any case, thanks again kind stranger(s) and I appreciate being given a crash course into the red pilled way of things. In the spirit of change, let&#039;s make this fucking planet (not just America), great again!<br><br>Don&#039;t mind the stupid picture, just something to gather attention.","filename":"IMG_5033","ext":".png","w":300,"h":250,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":208,"tim":1490663905463,"time":1490663905,"md5":"LTxlIuXCHrTBnFQzX+cUOQ==","fsize":28264,"resto":0,"id":"NnWcoKKn","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"thanks-kind-stranger","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":1,"unique_ips":2},{"no":118592157,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)21:27:44","name":"[user was banned for this post}","com":"<a href=\"#p118591186\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118591186<\/a><br><br>What-eva faggot USA<br>GTF BACK - we&#039;re FULL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;pic not related<\/span>","filename":"BLM","ext":".jpg","w":899,"h":566,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":78,"tim":1490664464529,"time":1490664464,"md5":"1a9SHZmB\/18XknevVUVDfw==","fsize":66163,"resto":118591186,"id":"jYLailr5","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"}]}

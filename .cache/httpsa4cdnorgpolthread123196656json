During the 1936 presidential campaign, Church President Heber J. Grant (who detested the Democrats&#039; New Deal policies) had another member of the Church&#039;s First Presidency write an unsigned editorial accusing Franklin D. Roosevelt of \u2018knowingly promoting unconstitutional laws and... advocating communism,&#039; among other things. The editorial outraged Mormon voters. Many saw the conservative hand of the Church presidency in the editorial; over seventy percent of the letters sent to the First Presidency office soon after its publication condemned the editorial. One historian noted that over 1,200 Latter-day Saints canceled their subscriptions to the Deseret News because of the editorial. It had clearly caused a backlash, and a few days after its publication, 69.3 percent of Utah&#039;s votes went for Franklin D. Roosevelt and the New Deal (see D. Michael Quinn, J.

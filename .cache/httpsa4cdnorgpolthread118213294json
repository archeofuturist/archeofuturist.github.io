Pretty tricky one, but probably not overly difficult. I&#039;ve tried to talk to women about this, mostly on reddit, cause that whole site is a bunch of pussies, but it&#039;s a landmine there and you can&#039;t ever have a serious discussion because I always hit some sort of tripwire and say something triggering and have my questions removed. Even with their moratorium on hard questions, I did manage to get a few females to admit to me they would prefer to get raped by women than by men, if forced to choose.<br><br>I thought as much. Men aren&#039;t bothered by getting raped by women either, but both genders seem to abhor being raped by men. If any girls actually are here, feel free to tell me your thoughts, after verifying you are feminine. Just censor the nipple like in anime and it&#039;s fine.<br><br>Anyway, where does that leave us? You&#039;d have to find out what it is about men that makes rape so bothersome. But, to stop rape, you could either do it socially, and mitigate the traumatic fallout that gets suffered, and turn women&#039;s reaction into more like men&#039;s attitude towards getting raped by women. This would take a huge propaganda campaign and about twenty years before the new breed of women hit the streets. Tricky endeavor.<br><br>Or, you could find some way to halt rape altogether, such as chastity belts. Or maybe there is even a third option... Like gender segregated societies.<br><br>Tell me your ideas, \/pol\/.","filename":"1490067776001","ext":".jpg","w":736,"h":630,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":213,"tim":1490439093348,"time":1490439093,"md5":"3+1P0qbDTUhpJzEkXEx1Dw==","fsize":76930,"resto":0,"id":"bH8GMDQo","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"hey-pol-im-trying-to-solve-the-worlds-problems","country_name":"Canada","replies":2,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":118213572,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)06:55:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118213294\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118213294<\/a><br>You have to go back<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;\/reddit\/cucks","time":1490439341,"resto":118213294,"id":"sVPKDjIG","country":"TD","country_name":"Chad"},{"no":118214699,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)07:13:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118213572\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118213572<\/a><br>On second thought never mind anyway.

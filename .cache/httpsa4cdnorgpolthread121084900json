Killing live babies is no different from aborting.<br><br>Realistically what are the arguments against that? You guys are attacking the wrong concept, babies and a fetus are both living entities, human life begins at conception.<br><br>Technically sperm is alive as well as it is a cell structure and likely an egg, so these arguments are a matter of the publics opinion as to what is morally acceptable to kill. You&#039;re going to kill something no matter what you do, it&#039;s just a matter of &quot;how large is the life you&#039;re destroying&quot;?<br><br>So technically yes, killing babies isn&#039;t that different from killing a fetus but I fail to see what this proves. If anything the article is making the case against abortion. It baffles me how normies are incapable of simple concepts such as these.","filename":"1487010619630","ext":".png","w":758,"h":600,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":98,"tim":1492195742355,"time":1492195742,"md5":"LdbEdC\/CLEAZlPUxNqrAQw==","fsize":564983,"resto":121084900,"id":"rc3waiUf","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121096497,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)14:51:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121091696\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121091696<\/a><br>Your wife is correct.

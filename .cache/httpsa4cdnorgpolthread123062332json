You can be both sexually and romantically attracted to the same gender and\/or the opposite. <br>If you&#039;re biologically a man but feel like a woman or the other way around you are an individual with gender dysphoria or GID, a mental illness. For that you go to a psychiatrist and sometimes they believe that the best thing to do is for the individual who&#039;s suffering from gender dysphoria to go through a sex change. After that the individual is still biologically the same gender as they were before but they look more like the opposite and will usually be called the opposite because it&#039;s most likely best for their mental health.<br>What am I missing, there&#039;s not a single new gender in all the things you can be? <br>You&#039;re either a man or a woman, you&#039;re either straight, gay or bisexual and if you have a sex change you&#039;re still biologically the same gender.","filename":"1493310657352","ext":".png","w":783,"h":617,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":196,"tim":1493315010694,"time":1493315010,"md5":"WoPoTdTgcpYR3MJ5CcKIRg==","fsize":1110231,"resto":0,"id":"yhbuGcBX","country":"IS","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"what-are-the-other-genders","country_name":"Iceland","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

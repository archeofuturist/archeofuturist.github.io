So word &quot;doctor&quot; is just a label. Think of white lab coat as lamb hide for the red handed wolves. Entire healthcare system is part of military industrial complex. It&#039;s way more potent and more deadly than all conventional and nuclear firepower combined. Why do you think they have on TV so many medical dramas, er tv shows, hospital soap operas, etc? Most of the doctors and nurses get their education from watching tv... The rest is taken care by muscular tongues and &quot;courage&quot; to pull the trigger. No man no problem.","time":1493378354,"resto":123180987,"id":"7PNSlgiF","country":"LT","country_name":"Lithuania"}]}

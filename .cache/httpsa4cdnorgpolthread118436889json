South east Texas is also a shithole.<br><br>ND is actually becoming shitty fast because of the oil boom there and the resulting mass migration of south eastern oil workers from the gulf coast oil industry.<br><br>Look into Alaska, Wyoming, Montana, Idaho, Oregon if you can tolerate libtards. YOu gotta remeber that the US is unevenly Urbanized and the population centers are WAY shittier than the rest of the country. Honorable mention for Nevada, aside from Vegas its actually a pretty awesome state if you like deserts(which I do).<br><br>Pic related, darker is better, and the darker some of the dark areas are actually the best places on earth to live.","filename":"QfskMv8","ext":".jpg","w":3877,"h":2694,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":86,"tim":1490572546680,"time":1490572546,"md5":"D0vHH9oSDlinO96\/lzEWPw==","fsize":1113590,"resto":118436889,"id":"F0Z7\/6lZ","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":118440159,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)20:00:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118436889\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118436889<\/a><br>They don&#039;t accept refugees in most of Asia. <br><br>If you&#039;re an obscenely rich globalist, your money will be welcome somewhere.<br><br>Otherwise, grow a pair and stay and fight.","time":1490572801,"resto":118436889,"id":"SDKWeuS0","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118440195,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)20:00:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118436889\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118436889<\/a>O<br>India, because they still have right-wing Sikhs and Hindus killing mudslimes there.","time":1490572814,"resto":118436889,"id":"RbyvfXpq","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118440356,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)20:01:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118439533\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118439533<\/a><br>yea dude i might enjoy the small-town life in rocky mountains or some shit like that, for sure<br><br>however, there are some things about american culture that annoy me. everything is so fucking turned up to 11, its sometimes hard to take it seriously. but leave the telly off, i guess. <br><br>the thing that kept bothering me the most while i was the in the US was the risk of mass shooters, but again, i guess im safer in small rural towns. <br><br>i did enjoy living in the US, and i did feel safe from islam there. only two islamic terrorist attacks there in 2016? the couple in california &amp; that gay guy in florida?","time":1490572894,"resto":118436889,"id":"sUtd9RBO","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":118440532,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)20:02:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118440159\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118440159<\/a><br>i wouldnt be a refugee, i would be a white guy who moved there. youre not a refugee when you move from fucking norway. wont be that way for quite a few years, i dont think","time":1490572967,"resto":118436889,"id":"sUtd9RBO","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":118440579,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)20:03:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118436889\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118436889<\/a><br>Join me in China","time":1490572984,"resto":118436889,"id":"XFELH4Xi","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118440989,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)20:06:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118440356\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118440356<\/a><br>the risk of mass shooters is non existent, it a meme pushed by media. you are WAY more likely to be killed driving, or in some other freak accident, you just hear about them non stop when they happen because its make the media money.<br><br>those terrorist attack are outliers as well, shit like that never actually happens anywhere but in urban centers with large minority populations.<br><br>I&#039;ve gotta take off now.","time":1490573163,"resto":118436889,"id":"F0Z7\/6lZ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118442211,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)20:14:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118440989\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118440989<\/a><br><br>dude, everyone has a fucking gun in the US. people kept showing me their guns in north dakota. atleast they were white people<br><br>in the US i felt 100% safe from foreign threats, but domestic.... some dude gets drunk or some shit, pulls his gun out. i saw on local news quite a few shootings while living there. mass shootings, probably not as bad, but the fact that everyone had a gun made me a bit uneasy","time":1490573659,"resto":118436889,"id":"sUtd9RBO","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"}]}

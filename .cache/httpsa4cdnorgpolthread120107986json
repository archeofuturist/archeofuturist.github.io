Since a lot of you don&#039;t understand, and as there are many shills about, let me tell you the truth.<br><br>US-backed Saudi Arabia wanted the construction of an oil pipeline in Syrian territory. The US of course supports Saudi Arabia, despite their numerous ties to terrorism, as they profit from their oil. Syria did not agree to the pipeline, and thus the US government funded rebels to start the Syrian war. These rebels &quot;do not fight for freedom&quot;, and will aim to destroy the Alawite&#039;s in favour of the Sunni religion backed by Saudi Arabia. Assad has no choice but to continue fighting - he has nothing to lose, and the consequences of his loss would be immense. Russia is allied with Syria, as Russia is a large exporter of oil and the increased competition of the Saudi pipeline would be catastrophic for their already crippled economy.<br><br>Assad is not the villain, don&#039;t fall for a cheap trick.","filename":"ASSAD-SYRIE","ext":".jpg","w":1728,"h":800,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":115,"tim":1491640097496,"time":1491640097,"md5":"ktwvQNl5YCuA7STxhoMD5A==","fsize":118300,"resto":0,"id":"JkyAFiGP","country":"AU","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-syrian-war","country_name":"Australia","replies":3,"images":2,"unique_ips":4},{"no":120108224,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)04:32:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120107986\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120107986<\/a><br>K..

Surveys of German doctors showed that over 90% (!) Of Russian unmarried women under the age of 21 were virgins. The conclusion was unexpected: the F\u00fchrer&#039;s assistant recommended him to stop the intervention against the Soviet Union, arguing that the people with such high morality can not be defeated.<br><br>Therefore, Hitler and his approximate, no doubt, were well aware of the claims of ancient treatises about the invincibility of that state where there are many virgins. &quot;The strength of the people can be judged on two grounds: respect for the elders and the virginity of the virgins.&quot; Virgins and chaste women have a subtle mystical energy that improves the karma of the state and increases the will power and purposefulness of its inhabitants.<br><br>Hitler easily captured a depraved Europe: it took a week to conquer France, and Denmark capitulated in a day and a half. The reason is not the numerical superiority of the army or its armament. If the inhabitants of the country are concerned only with drinking and women, then it does not matter to them what regime they should live in, if only they are not deprived of these pleasures.","filename":"Devushki_VOV","ext":".jpg","w":590,"h":401,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":169,"tim":1492543979006,"time":1492543979,"md5":"umbS3H992adXCHHNH+3HOA==","fsize":37996,"resto":0,"id":"mcWE9n\/S","country":"RU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"how-the-russian-morality-defeated-hitler","country_name":"Russian Federation","replies":6,"images":0,"unique_ips":6},{"no":121727482,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)15:33:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121727438\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121727438<\/a><br>Bo\u0437\u043co\u0436\u043do, \u0432\u044b \u0438\u043ce\u043b\u0438 \u0432 \u0432\u0438\u0434y: Hitler was sure that it would take no more than 2 months to conquer Russia, but it turned out that the Russians had another system of values. Instead of cherishing their lives and carnal pleasures as a &quot;bad boy&quot;, Soviet citizens valued more for what they lived for - for the sake of the bright future of future generations. Not for themselves and their children, but for the sake of those who will live after, they sacrificed their lives and the lives of their children. Hitler was perplexed when he heard how desperately the whole country was desperately resisting him, in which even the children rushed to the tanks with grenades and shouting: &quot;For the Motherland!&quot;. Hitler could not understand what power allows a Russian to fight until his last breath, even when there is no chance of survival. It was the source of this moral power, which gives the will power, and it was indicated in the memorandum. Her copy was sent to Eric Koch, Hitler&#039;s protege in Ukraine. He also had big problems with this freedom-loving people, and it is interesting that Koch responded to this report: &quot;teach their women to drink, and this problem will be finished!&quot;","time":1492544004,"resto":121727438,"id":"mcWE9n\/S","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":121728100,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)15:37:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"Better times.","time":1492544276,"resto":121727438,"id":"zFDrr0q1","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121730897,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)15:58:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121727438\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121727438<\/a><br>Survival of the strongest.","time":1492545515,"resto":121727438,"id":"JgpLEdmU","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":121732256,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)16:08:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"SLAV POWER FUCK YEAH","time":1492546121,"resto":121727438,"id":"+UVnRxZ9","country":"SK","country_name":"Slovakia"},{"no":121732621,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)16:11:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121727438\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121727438<\/a><br>Red pill me on Soviet women marksmen, how bamf were they?","time":1492546284,"resto":121727438,"id":"MSqa7Hie","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121733091,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)16:14:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"Yes, and now these generations are all lost.

He tells of a peasant woman who returned home one day to find her three children, her mother and her sister sitting around a table, each with its own decapitated head placed carefully on the table in front of the body, the hands arranged on top &quot;as if each body was stroking its own head.&quot;<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The assassins, from the Salvadoran National Guard, had found it hard to keep the head of an 18-month-old baby in place, so they nailed the hands onto it. A large plastic bowl filled with blood was tastefully displayed in the centre of the table. According to Rev. Santiago, macabre scenes of this kind aren&#039;t uncommon.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;People are not just killed by death squads in El Salvador -- they are decapitated and then their heads are placed on pikes and used to dot the landscape. Men are not just disembowelled by the Salvadoran Treasury Police; their severed genitalia are stuffed into their mouths. Salvadoran women are not just raped by the National Guard; their wombs are cut from their bodies and used to cover their faces. It is not enough to kill children; they are dragged over barbed wire until the flesh falls from their bones, while parents are forced to watch.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Rev. Santiago goes on to point out that violence of this sort greatly increased when the Church began forming peasant associations and self-help groups in an attempt to organise the poor.<\/span><br><br>https:\/\/libcom.org\/history\/articles<wbr>\/el-salvador-counterinsurgency<br><br>But I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll defend it since they deserved it for being lefties and the end justifies the means.","time":1490920583,"resto":118961386,"id":"LmEO\/UF5","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118994198,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)20:37:41","name":"subhuman communist","com":"*almost destroys europe*","time":1490920661,"resto":118961386,"id":"UIjNBflp","country":"NZ","country_name":"New Zealand"},{"no":118994315,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)20:38:50","name":"subhuman communist","com":"*puts your family in the gulag for misbehaving*","time":1490920730,"resto":118961386,"id":"UIjNBflp","country":"NZ","country_name":"New Zealand"},{"no":118994416,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)20:39:45","name":"subhuman communist","com":"*defends genocide*","time":1490920785,"resto":118961386,"id":"UIjNBflp","country":"NZ","country_name":"New Zealand"},{"no":118994479,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)20:40:27","name":"Anonymous","filename":"7e9cc84c14983f9912cc1648ac45c138c52a495ba137d16fe4d37456541b200c","ext":".jpg","w":570,"h":855,"tn_w":83,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490920827640,"time":1490920827,"md5":"xW\/TNQxth2IdqU0glykHRA==","fsize":142557,"resto":118961386,"id":"BXrVrnJ9","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":118994540,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)20:41:04","name":"subhuman communist","com":"*indoctrinates youth*","time":1490920864,"resto":118961386,"id":"UIjNBflp","country":"NZ","country_name":"New Zealand"},{"no":118994777,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)20:43:15","name":"subhuman communist","com":"*blindly follows leader*","time":1490920995,"resto":118961386,"id":"UIjNBflp","country":"NZ","country_name":"New Zealand"},{"no":118994921,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)20:44:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;the trump meme is dying because hes now president and thus an old meme.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;commie posting is replacing Trump posting.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;trying to argue against it just makes you an old meme shouter who lost the ability to be funny.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;4chan belongs to the commies now.<\/span>","filename":"1487809971730","ext":".png","w":291,"h":344,"tn_w":105,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490921071598,"time":1490921071,"md5":"dVGu1PwoHinAViWRysOvdA==","fsize":87218,"resto":118961386,"id":"tccHjOyD","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118995054,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)20:45:44","name":"subhuman communist","com":"*joins breadline*","time":1490921144,"resto":118961386,"id":"UIjNBflp","country":"NZ","country_name":"New Zealand"},{"no":118995619,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)20:51:05","name":"subhuman communist","com":"*desperately shills his dying ideology on anime website*","time":1490921465,"resto":118961386,"id":"UIjNBflp","country":"NZ","country_name":"New Zealand"},{"no":118996142,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)20:56:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118994921\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118994921<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;communism<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;not an old and stale meme<\/span><br>Pick one and only one<br><br>Also, sage","filename":"1488925564685","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":720,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1490921768297,"time":1490921768,"md5":"6dC3ohOzbr6k5tl7sw7a9A==","fsize":152289,"resto":118961386,"id":"Wn66uFMk","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":118996261,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)20:57:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118993140\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118993140<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Rojava<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;funded, armed, trained and defended by Western capitalist states<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;economy entirely based on previous capitalist infrastructure and intellectual capital and people mostly just doing business as usual with exception of military junta throwing some people on the work benches (contributed by capitalists) to fuel war machinery <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;survives on selling natural ressources collected with with capitalist infrastructure to capitalists countries<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;doesnt actually exist as a state and is literally just a foreign capitalist asset and funded militia making claims for geopolitical ambitions of the capitalist countries<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;successful commie state<\/span><br><br>HAHAHAHAHA","time":1490921835,"resto":118961386,"id":"hdszcSOI","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":118996437,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)20:59:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118996142\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118996142<\/a><br><br>Trump&#039;s \/pol\/ lost its meme magic, son.

Exploitation is when these two principles are not met, when the agents are not receiving according to their work or needs. This process of exploitation is a part of the redistribution of labour, occurring during the process of separate agents exchanging their current productive labour for social labour set in goods received. The labour put forth toward production is embodied in the goods and exploitation occurs when someone purchases a good, with their revenue or wages, for an amount unequal to the total labour he or she has put forth. This labour performed by a population over a certain time period is equal to the labour embodied to the goods that make up the net national product (NNP). The NNP is then parceled out to the members of the population in some way and this is what creates the two groups, or agents, involved in the exchange of goods: exploiters and exploited.","filename":"1485817932173","ext":".jpg","w":194,"h":260,"tn_w":93,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490931820233,"time":1490931820,"md5":"B+xUES01QN3hjATCQ4WOUQ==","fsize":13511,"resto":118961386,"id":"MLeF8lAn","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119015127,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)23:44:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119015029\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119015029<\/a><br>The exploiters are the agents able to command goods, with revenue from their wages, that are embodied with more labour than the exploiters themselves have put forth. These agents often have class status and ownership of productive assets that aid the optimization of exploitation. The exploiters would typically be the bourgeoisie. Meanwhile, the exploited are those who receive less than the average product he or she produces. If workers receive an amount equivalent to their average product, there is no revenue left over. Thus, these workers cannot enjoy the fruits of their own labours and the difference between what is made and what that can purchase cannot be justified by redistribution according to need.

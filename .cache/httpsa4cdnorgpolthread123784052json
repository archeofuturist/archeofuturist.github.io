I&#039;m not usually one to agree with the stoners on Facebook but it really is true that the fact that marijuana and psychedelics are illegal while alcohol is not is a testament to how biased the US government is. Killing someone while on crack should be illegal because you&#039;re killing someone, not because you&#039;re on crack.

I will punish all who use drugs. All dope smokers are a reprobation in My sight! I will ensure that all pot smokers enter Hell for eternity, for refusing My Spirit, and taking a false one of Satan. I will ensure that they will be punished for eternity, the price for sorcery. They do it to get high, but they enter the false spirit realm of Satan. All must be punished from My Presence for taking a drug that is not of Me. Medicine is OK, but drugs is of Satan. Getting high is of the Devil. I will punish all who take the counterfeit form of spirituality from Satan. Many are on drugs, they must repent, by refusing Me, taking a counterfeit form of spirituality of Satan, induced by chemicals and plants. All must come out of drugs, including the hard drugs, morphine, opium, heroin, cocaine, and the rest, or they will burn in Hell forever. I will ensure all who distribute drugs, including the CIA, go there forever, profiting off the misery and addiction of others. All will go to Hell, unless they repent.

But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, Meekness, temperance: against such there is no law.

For example, selection in one population might favor a large body size, whereas in another population small body size might be more advantageous, while individuals with intermediate body sizes are comparatively disadvantaged in both populations.

Within isolated breeding populations, alleles are selected in the context of the local genetic background. Because the same alleles may have rather different effects in different genetic backgrounds\u2014there is the potential evolution of different locally adapted gene complexes.

Hybrid vigor in the first generation can, in some circumstances, be strong enough to mask the effects of outbreeding depression. An example of this is that plant breeders will make F1 hybrids from purebred strains, which will improve the uniformity and vigor of the offspring, however the F1 generation are not used for further breeding because of unpredictable phenotypes in their offspring. Unless there is strong selective pressure, outbreeding depression can increase in further generations as co-adapted gene complexes are broken apart without the forging of new co-adapted gene complexes to take their place.<\/span>","time":1491270626,"resto":119412516,"id":"HJvZ+Ntq","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119414091,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)21:52:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119412516\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119412516<\/a><br>so a new z + a new z = an american?","time":1491270733,"resto":119412516,"id":"7h9AtGy2","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119414112,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)21:52:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"Incest erotica are my best sellers. <br><br>Do much better than my paranormal erotica.","time":1491270742,"resto":119412516,"id":"A1NOlamP","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

In a nutshell<br>a)people who come to italy are different. In the north eastxwe have a flux of folks from afghanistan, pakistan, syria. In the south there is a huge flux of africans. After the death of ghaddafi, the flhx started. He was the one who blocked them.<br>Anyways, they roman free in the cities, i know people who teach italian to these people but classes are usually almost empty. Yes they have iphones. No nobodyfines them if they do not have a bus ticket. You can see them mostly shopping in a grocery store group of supermarkets named LIDL, which is german. I am assuming they five them free coupons to shop there. Or somethimf. They get \u20ac30-40 of cash per day. The other expenses like food, clothes, efc are all already covered by specific companies who host fhese people in specific buildings (nice buildings, i will be honest with you. They do not lice in slums. They are treated like actual human beings here in the north). These companies get funded by the government. also they pay almost no taxes.<br>They DO molest women from time to time. There has been an almost rape many times. Two that I know of surely. I have been seeing the same faces for years desu. These people are not looking for jobs. I guess the long term plan is moving to a country that will support them for an even longer amount of time,like france or sweden.<br><br>How do people feel about them:<br>older people: Empathic. They believe most of these people come from syria. however after the rape attempts, they feel intimidated.not scared though. They are ok with these people roaming in the town.","filename":"1491873709624","ext":".jpg","w":688,"h":628,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":228,"tim":1492086440604,"time":1492086440,"md5":"h90UEgn0KdeD\/fUJfDzKsQ==","fsize":60512,"resto":0,"id":"bQrvEELM","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"im-talking-to-a-person-from-northern-italy-right","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":1,"unique_ips":1},{"no":120904164,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)08:28:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"Young people: immigrants from eastern europe, like me, are livid because we have to work and find jobs in this dying economy otherwise we gotta fuck off asap, but these arabs, pakis, etc can stay here without doing anything. the others..well, depends. Most young people here that are italian do not find stable jobs up until they are 28 or more, and do not care much,on average, so, they are not bothered by much in life. Also most people work for some public company or for the government, so, they are not much stressed or bothered by much in life. No they do not work at all. Only people in the healrh system (which is funded by the governmnet) work their ass off. And there is a war with the health system. But we are not gonna get into that discussion too otherwise this message will never end. The people i know who already have seriosu jobs are starting to feel used for their tax money to pay for these savages, but not enough yet.<br><br>Oh btw...there are no children.<br><br>I repeat, there are no children.<br><br>There are no women.<br><br>There are no old people.<br><br>I promise, not even one. That I have seen. Magbe they are somewhere. Not in grocery stores or in the street tho.<br><br>Sorry dor the typos. i am at work now and cbf to fix them.","filename":"d56","ext":".gif","w":280,"h":302,"tn_w":115,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492086488344,"time":1492086488,"md5":"6vnRhyyLdZA7FIn\/\/C1FtA==","fsize":3808696,"resto":120904100,"id":"bQrvEELM","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

The women of the United States are rapidly falling in sexual market value, as they embrace unhealthy cultural trends, such as Feminism and the abandonment of religious\/traditional values, hedonistic social behaviors, such as sexual promiscuity, and most discouraging, the exponential rise in obesity rates of adult females. This causes the sexual market value of healthy females, both socially and biologically, to rise far above the reach of the average American male.","filename":"Walmart","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":375,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":156,"tim":1493083409151,"time":1493083409,"md5":"tPXu6jmxnD9ojDa8sTYGlg==","fsize":89947,"resto":0,"id":"cUlhUYo3","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"manifesto-time-bitches","country_name":"United States","replies":4,"images":0,"unique_ips":1},{"no":122670825,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)21:24:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"If these female obesity rates continue with this trends, most of the next generation of American children will be born into households with two obese parents and obese siblings. This will greatly decrease the viability of the future population of the United States. With the disgusting fat-acceptance movement actively trying to discourage healthy behaviors in American women and the morally corrupt modern Feminist movement attempting to dismantle positive family values throughout society, American men must look outside of their native country to find healthy mates that will raise their shared children with traditional values and consider the forced deportation of degenerate women from the United States.<br> Currently, almost 40% of women in the United States are obese and about 65% of women in the United States are either obese or overweight (Ogden et al., 2014). This rising statistic is a grave signifier for the health of the American population, as obesity results in numerous health complications, such as heart disease, stroke, high blood pressure, diabetes, and gout. Obesity, especially in women, also results in to a complete absence of physical sexual market value, as potential male mates will inevitable be repulsed by the signifiers of an unhealthy body.","time":1493083467,"resto":122670712,"id":"cUlhUYo3","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122670883,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)21:24:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"This factors have contributed to the steep decline in American marriage and birth rates. With only about 35% percent of American women being of healthy stock, many men will either be forced to reproduce with unhealthy women, therefore diminishing the health of the American \u201cherd\u201d, or will be forced to look for healthy, physically attractive, traditional, foreign women to become the mothers of their children. The latter option is far preferred from an evolutionary perspective. Not only will the health of future offspring be improved through the use of this option, happiness for both parents and children will be increased and hybrid vigor may result from this exogamy.<br> Now, American men must look towards other countries to produce potential mates for them. These countries should come from cultures that promote healthy living and traditional values, such as those found in Europe and East Asia, but countries and cultures where tribal behaviors are still embraced, such as Africa and culturally-mixed populations in Central and South America, should be avoided.","time":1493083498,"resto":122670712,"id":"cUlhUYo3","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122670939,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)21:25:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"These women would preferably be religious (Christian) and conservative in social views, as parents that embrace traditional values have been shown to increase the prosperity of their children. An example of one of these cultures would be Eastern Europe. Eastern Europe on a whole has a substantially lower obesity and overweight rate in their women than in America, a higher religiosity, and a higher propensity for traditional family values. Another culture would be East Asian culture for the same reasons as Eastern European culture. While these cultures do have their obese individuals, they have so at much lower rates the United States and other countries within the Anglosphere. Many smart individuals, such as President Donald Trump, have already married foreign women from these cultures, acting as early adopters of this breeding strategy. The United States government should consider the mass importation of healthy, non-degenerate women into the United States as potential mates for the unpaired male population.","time":1493083521,"resto":122670712,"id":"cUlhUYo3","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122670978,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)21:25:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"Now that the solution has been found for this American breeding problem, a solution for the unpaired, unhealthy, disgusting females must also be found. The preferred solution for this issue of permanently single females would be the mass deportation of these individuals to \u201cenemy\u201d nations as a means of both decreasing welfare costs in the United States and genetically sabotaging potential threat populations, such as the Islamic World. If this mass deportation cannot be achieved due to logistical issues, such as weight limits on commercial cargo ships, then the United States government should consider the forced use of birth control implants in obese and overweight females that would only be removed when these women reached a healthy weight.<br>Works Cited<br>&quot;Health Risks Linked to Obesity.&quot; WebMD.

His confession of Christ as Messiah poured forth from him, a heartfelt declaration of Peter\u2019s personal faith in Jesus. It is this personal faith in Christ which is the hallmark of the true Christian. Those who have placed their faith in Christ, as Peter did, are the church. Peter expresses this in 1 Peter 2:4 when he addressed the believers who had been dispersed around the ancient world: \u201cComing to Him as to a living stone, rejected indeed by men, but chosen by God and precious, you also, as living stones, are being built up a spiritual house, a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.\u201d<br><br>At this point, Jesus declares that God had revealed this truth to Peter. The word for \u201cPeter,\u201d Petros, means a small stone (John 1:42). Jesus used a play on words here with petra (\u201con this rock\u201d) which means a foundation boulder, as in Matthew 7:24, 25 when He described the rock upon which the wise man builds his house. Peter himself uses the same imagery in his first epistle: the church is built of numerous small petros \u201cliving stones\u201d (1 Peter 2:5) who, like Peter, confess that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God, and those confessions of faith are the bedrock of the church.","time":1492247573,"resto":121177212,"id":"S217NGmj","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121191450,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)05:12:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121191288\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121191288<\/a><br>Just as natural selection has shaped the evolution of humans, plants, and all living things on the planet, natural selection shapes viruses, too.

The pathogen\u2019s job is to evade the immune system, create more copies of itself, and spread to other hosts. Characteristics that help a virus do its job tend to be kept from one generation to another. Characteristics that make it difficult for the virus to spread to another host tend to be lost.<br><br>Take, for example, a virus that has a mutation that makes it particularly deadly to its human host and kills the host within a few hours of infection. The virus needs a new, healthy host for its descendents to survive. If it kills its host before the host infects others, that mutation will disappear.<br><br>One way hosts protect themselves from a virus is to develop antibodies to it. Antibodies lock onto the outer surface proteins of a virus and prevent it from entering host cells.

It is a mistake to think that here He is giving either of those roles to Peter. There is a sense in which the apostles played a foundational role in the building of the church (Ephesians 2:20), but the role of primacy is reserved for Christ alone, not assigned to Peter. So, Jesus\u2019 words here are best interpreted as a simple play on words in that a boulder-like truth came from the mouth of one who was called a small stone. And Christ Himself is called the \u201cchief cornerstone\u201d (1 Peter 2:6, 7). The chief cornerstone of any building was that upon which the building was anchored. If Christ declared Himself to be the cornerstone, how could Peter be the rock upon which the church was built? It is more likely that the believers, of which Peter is one, are the stones which make up the church, anchored upon the Cornerstone, \u201cand he who believes on Him will by no means be put to shame\u201d (1 Peter 2:6).<br><br>The Roman Catholic Church uses the argument that Peter is the rock to which Jesus referred as evidence that it is the one true church. As we have seen, Peter&#039;s being the rock is not the only valid interpretation of this verse. Even if Peter is the rock in Matthew 16:18, this is meaningless in giving the Roman Catholic Church any authority. Scripture nowhere records Peter being in Rome. Scripture nowhere describes Peter as being supreme over the other apostles. The New Testament does not describe Peter as being the \u201call authoritative leader\u201d of the early Christian church. Peter was not the first pope, and Peter did not start the Roman Catholic Church. The origin of the Catholic Church is not in the teachings of Peter or any other apostle. If Peter truly was the founder of the Roman Catholic Church, it would be in full agreement with what Peter taught (Acts chapter 2, 1 Peter, 2 Peter).","time":1492247608,"resto":121177212,"id":"S217NGmj","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121191521,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)05:13:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121191443\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121191443<\/a><br>That doesn&#039;t mean the early christians are PRODDIE or agree with them<br><br>Retard","time":1492247632,"resto":121177212,"id":"J9STZT4C","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121191529,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)05:14:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"Happy Ishtar everyone!<br><br>It&#039;s that time of the year again where we celebrate the goddess of fertility and love.<br>But don&#039;t forget, love can be fatal!","filename":"Ishtar_vase_Louvre_AO17000-detail","ext":".jpg","w":528,"h":1168,"tn_w":56,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492247640274,"time":1492247640,"md5":"BP0C03XDBgxPvxRoYU5IWA==","fsize":458078,"resto":121177212,"id":"ymG6E\/m+","country":"AT","m_img":1,"country_name":"Austria"},{"no":121191586,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)05:14:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121180117\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121180117<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Please say prayers to these people who are not Jesus<\/span><br><br>Heresy<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;You may not find salvation without going through a middle man (clergy)<\/span><br><br>Heresy<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;You need to use a middle man (clergy) as a conduit for God<\/span><br><br>Supreme Heresy<br><br>Clergy are for spreading the word and education.

My obligation as a Christian is to be as rigorous in the understanding of my faith as I can be, not to pick sides when the only side that matters is in fulfilling one&#039;s obligations to God.","time":1492249219,"resto":121177212,"id":"rK4CIWoF","country":"US","trip":"!!nRmWeBC0+kN","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121193372,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)05:40:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121193260\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121193260<\/a><br>Wmaf irl","filename":"image","ext":".jpg","w":1080,"h":1315,"tn_w":102,"tn_h":124,"tim":1492249229984,"time":1492249229,"md5":"CiNljtLOyKaYwpsxedSiHQ==","fsize":156819,"resto":121177212,"id":"J9STZT4C","country":"GB","m_img":1,"country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121193404,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)05:41:00","name":"Praceteom","com":"<a href=\"#p121193033\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121193033<\/a><br>That&#039;s nice spammer - they have other things they said that are insightful.","time":1492249260,"resto":121177212,"id":"rK4CIWoF","country":"US","trip":"!!nRmWeBC0+kN","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121193420,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)05:41:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121193358\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121193358<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;rational<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;deny history<\/span>","time":1492249274,"resto":121177212,"id":"J9STZT4C","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121193446,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)05:41:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121193404\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121193404<\/a><br>Like how they contradict protestantism","time":1492249301,"resto":121177212,"id":"J9STZT4C","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121193470,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)05:42:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121193372\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121193372<\/a><br>Know your place, you built a wall for us.","filename":"1492158740389","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":418,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":81,"tim":1492249327171,"time":1492249327,"md5":"kPwO2kUaqQkZz89knAnrLA==","fsize":91252,"resto":121177212,"id":"cY97wlX9","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":121193478,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)05:42:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121177212\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121177212<\/a><br>Unite now ,<br>kill all mudslums threads","time":1492249333,"resto":121177212,"id":"OetaL34H","country":"BG","country_name":"Bulgaria"},{"no":121193485,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)05:42:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121193237\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121193237<\/a><br>Protestants can&#039;t even agree on what the bible says<br><br>Retard","time":1492249341,"resto":121177212,"id":"J9STZT4C","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121193523,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)05:42:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121193470\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121193470<\/a><br>Kys","filename":"image","ext":".jpg","w":634,"h":872,"tn_w":90,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492249370399,"time":1492249370,"md5":"1+wCeUjfL72el6HV97seLQ==","fsize":118585,"resto":121177212,"id":"J9STZT4C","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121193551,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)05:43:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121180201\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121180201<\/a><br>I will pray for you,anon.","time":1492249404,"resto":121177212,"id":"OetaL34H","country":"BG","country_name":"Bulgaria"},{"no":121193597,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)05:43:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121193207\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121193207<\/a><br>Liar.

I work at an elementary school in Long Beach CA, and we had six trans kids (all MtF, chosen by their parents), and I just encouraged their bullying. Whenever I&#039;d see the trans kids getting bullied or picked on, I&#039;d flash their bullies a quick smile, or I&#039;d just walk right past and do nothing. It was very clear that I wouldn&#039;t tolerate bullying directed at normal kids though, I&#039;d crack down on it fast.<br><br>The crazy part? I work at a very liberal school, and all but one of the teachers there (the teacher with six trans kids in her class) did the same thing. We intentionally made their lives shitty. And wouldn&#039;t you know it, four of the six are back to &quot;normal&quot; or as normal as normal goes for their hormone-warped frames. The other two are irredeemable, and I&#039;m just glad we won&#039;t have to put up with their or their parents whiny bullshit anymore.","time":1490140637,"resto":117687271,"id":"2I9nomNC","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117690401,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)19:59:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117687271\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117687271<\/a><br>I pray for those stuck in the Shillary universe <br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Q-D<wbr>-CowBL-s","time":1490140756,"resto":117687271,"id":"SIKazSQN","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117692665,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)20:19:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"bump","time":1490141991,"resto":117687271,"id":"W4TzEd0h","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117692935,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)20:22:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117687875\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117687875<\/a><br>That&#039;s not even the worst part of the ceremony.

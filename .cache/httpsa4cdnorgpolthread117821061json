According to Giuseppe Sergi, the Mediterranean race was the &quot;greatest race of the world&quot; and was singularly responsible for the most accomplished civilisations of ancient times, including those of Mesopotamia, Persia, Egypt, Greece, Phoenicia, Carthage, and Rome. The Mediterranean race was also a major influence to the outside world in the modern era: Portugal established the first global empire in history, during the 16th century, followed contemporary by Spain, setting both nations in the highest dominion of political and economics powers in Europe.<br><br>C. G. Seligman also stated that &quot;it must, I think, be recognised that the Mediterranean race has actually more achievements to its credit than any other race, since it is responsible for by far the greater part of Mediterranean civilisation, certainly before 1000 BC (and probably much later), and so shaped not only the Aegean cultures, but those of Western as well as the greater part of Eastern Mediterranean lands, while the culture of their near relatives, the Hamitic pre-dynastic Egyptians, formed the basis of that of Egypt.&quot;<br><br>The Nazis explained this away by claiming that the elite warriors of the aristocracy of Ancient Greece, of Ancient Rome, and of the Spanish Empire and Portuguese Empire were Nordic Aryans who had migrated south. However, they did admit that those of the Mediterranean race in general and notably such geniuses of the Mediterranean race as Dante Alighieri, Michelangelo, Andrea Palladio, Galileo Galilei, Enrico Fermi and Leonardo da Vinci tended to be more creative than Nordics.","filename":"w","ext":".png","w":1000,"h":657,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":164,"tim":1490214887595,"time":1490214887,"md5":"evjkl+d+V1SuhuaY4p85Gw==","fsize":197515,"resto":0,"id":"0R4+v82C","country":"PT","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-fact-that-the-mediterranean-race-is","country_name":"Portugal","replies":31,"images":7,"unique_ips":21},{"no":117821514,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)16:37:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"Mediterranean bros where you at.","time":1490215064,"resto":117821061,"id":"6+yJB2mv","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":117821850,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)16:40:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"hello my med bros! i&#039;m 1\/64 spanish","filename":"kjhbkjh","ext":".png","w":379,"h":240,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":79,"tim":1490215205794,"time":1490215205,"md5":"NApnErGtHfgPJ2TED2OuXg==","fsize":164547,"resto":117821061,"id":"sLzJyKE\/","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":117822339,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)16:43:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117821850\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117821850<\/a><br>Honorary mediterreaneans:<br><br>Finland<br>Iceland<br>Hong Kong<br>North Korea<br>Macau<br>Isle of man<br>Romania<br>Hawaii<br>Estonia<br>Mars","time":1490215391,"resto":117821061,"id":"6+yJB2mv","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":117822949,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)16:47:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117821061\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117821061<\/a><br>That&#039;s all well and dandy, but we&#039;re not Mediterranean, we&#039;re Atlantic. <br><br>We border a proper Ocean, not a kiddy pool.","filename":"mcnamara","ext":".jpg","w":564,"h":564,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":124,"tim":1490215623179,"time":1490215623,"md5":"\/nmbuV2IKTUsWc+A4QsZTg==","fsize":72981,"resto":117821061,"id":"BpqyB\/jf","country":"PT","country_name":"Portugal"},{"no":117823014,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)16:47:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117821061\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117821061<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Ukraine<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mediterranean<\/span><br>Your map seems a bit off.","time":1490215645,"resto":117821061,"id":"b6v9R9SR","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117823382,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)16:49:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117822949\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117822949<\/a><br>Roman province is Roman.","filename":"P67ppcf","ext":".png","w":315,"h":210,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1490215790091,"time":1490215790,"md5":"FflxN78IXqUVUDLWDo+dHA==","fsize":46852,"resto":117821061,"id":"U6BTmsN0","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117823411,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)16:50:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117822339\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117822339<\/a><br>Estonia and Finland are but not Hungary?","time":1490215802,"resto":117821061,"id":"WAZqNkd6","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117824344,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)16:55:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117822339\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117822339<\/a><br>Not the United States of America.

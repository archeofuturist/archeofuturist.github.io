I keep wondering when my youth will spontaneously have a spark and the &quot;good times&quot; start but it doesn&#039;t happen. My car is like a cocoon and when I went to the library or cinema I just felt like a friendless loser who was conned. I had zero social life during university as well and I know that when I start my first full time job it will be boring and I will miss all that free time I wasted.<br><br>Of course all those qt girls I see during the day fuck ten chads a day. Of course all the students I see are having the time of their lives. Every normie is in on some joke that I will never know.","filename":"tumblr_static_tumblr_static_640","ext":".jpg","w":607,"h":341,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1490832807121,"time":1490832807,"md5":"opIlrrjCnv6OvQVVDi0PEA==","fsize":34987,"resto":0,"id":"YWWNJhH3","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"for-the-past-two-years-my-main-hobby-has-been","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":118855278,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)20:14:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118855145\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118855145<\/a><br>r","time":1490832896,"resto":118855145,"id":"fqtoPF9x","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

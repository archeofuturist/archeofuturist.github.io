I think it&#039;s a trap I don&#039;t know just feels weird. Why would someone stealing less than $1000 even go to trial and why would I be called to testify against someone I&#039;ve never seen in my entire life? I looked up the plaintiff and he looks like you&#039;re typical low life criminal he&#039;s probably guilty but i would rather not get involved.","filename":"F8reXuE","ext":".jpg","w":864,"h":864,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491980915627,"time":1491980915,"md5":"0atVY8jaZET+kFlXTrGnLg==","fsize":112855,"resto":0,"id":"H\/kdhWhM","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"got-subpeonad-what-the-fuck-do-i-do","country_name":"United States","replies":3,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":120727548,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)03:10:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120727347\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120727347<\/a><br>I dont get it.

In many ways it means you can cut down on word length and be far more creative with wording and how you emphasize certain words in a sentence. Take Latin. There are so many word structures that allow for them to be simply understood or go to great depths to convey a certain meaning. It&#039;s truly an amazing language.<br><br>On that note I say least retarded goes to Latin for sure.","time":1491360912,"resto":119555950,"id":"bLHAHIzR","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119557213,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)22:57:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119555950\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119555950<\/a><br>the best languages have a latin based alphabets","time":1491361068,"resto":119555950,"id":"RDZCxBrv","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119557310,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)22:58:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"English is the borg of languages.

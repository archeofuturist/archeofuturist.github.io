Here is my interpretation.<br><br>It happens when the weather cools is actually only the final condition, because &quot;that&#039;s when they&#039;ll make their move&quot;. Before that, all the other things will have to happen first. The prophecy, however, is not quite in the right order. Some things that are seperated by several lines actually belong together. Here is what I think is required\/will happen.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Three branches will become one<\/span><br>Probably the easiest to decipher, the 3 branches of US government becoming dominated\/subjugated by the Trump Presidency.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;An Island will drift away<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The Ravens will starve<\/span><br>These two belong together. The island drifting away is brexit, and the ravens are the ravens in the tower of London. It is said that &quot;if the Tower of London ravens are lost or fly away, the Crown will fall and Britain with it.&quot; Brexit was the beginning of the end, for Great Britain at least. Already we can see tears at the edge with a new Scotland independence referendum.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;A killing bolt will shine in the night, but will not kill<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The rod and the ring will strike<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The bear will leave its cave forever<\/span><br>The killing bolt, despite talk of yesterday, has not yet happened. The hint is in &quot;Shine in the Night&quot;. It will be an EMP, my guess is that NK will launch a nuke that prematurely detonates, leading to no (direct) casualties, but an EMP that will still hit some stuff. The rod and the ring are references to the actual mechanism of detonating a nuclear device. After this, it is not the US, SK or even China that is first to respond. Russia will immediately mobilize its military and invade, and to be honest, they&#039;ll have the support of everyone to some degree. Russia will, however, not demobilize after this. The bear has left its cave forever.<br><br>(1\/2)","filename":"advanced shitposting riddle","ext":".png","w":641,"h":1230,"tn_w":130,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491553388032,"time":1491553388,"md5":"Cl2W+CxJau8cEnoyXGOGtQ==","fsize":170811,"resto":0,"id":"v4czI5w4","country":"NL","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"welcome-to-another-episode-pol-eschatology-and","country_name":"Netherlands","replies":1,"images":1,"unique_ips":1},{"no":119913332,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)04:23:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119913244\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119913244<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The star will gorge itself on clay<\/span><br>The star of david is a clear representation of Israel, and their constantly expanding settlement.

It won&#039;t be ISIS, it will be Erdogan personally hoisting a pure Black Flag over the Haga Sophia, making it a mosque again. The black flag has a long history in Islam and a black banner was used by Muhammed himself, along with a white eagle. He will claim to not allign himself with ISIS, and he isn&#039;t lying. He wants to restore the Ottoman Empire himself.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The belly of the dragon will drip water. <\/span><br>Two options. First: the Phillipines has sent troops to secure islands in the South China Sea. The leaking water refers to loss of local naval dominance.

That all will hear them strikes to me as it being two major religious figures, that will be heard by everyone either through mourning of a dead leader, or of celebration of a dead enemy. My bets are that at least one of them will be the Pope, the Ayatollah, or the Dalai Lama. However, with the death of a Pope, a new one must be elected and I think he shall take upon himself the name Petrus. This will be the first Peter since the actual apostle &quot;Tu es Petrus et super hanc petram aedificabo ecclesiam meam&quot; (You are Peter, and on this rock I shall build my church.

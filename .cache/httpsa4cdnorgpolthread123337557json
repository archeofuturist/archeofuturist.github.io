When I see someone claiming bullshit I say I understand where they&#039;re coming from - and I do - but I remind them to also think of the facts (ones they can verify) that made assume a different attitude. Most regressives are simply clueless people who cling to some message because it upholds certain values they see as positive. What you should do is to make them realize you also uphold those positive values and THAT is why you&#039;re opposing their views, because their views and the message they hear is often against the values they believe in.<br><br>Of course, it depends on the values and the topic. You shouldn&#039;t lie and purposefully act like you care just to &#039;convert&#039; people, but be there to offer different, well-argued points not from the perspective of an opponent, but someone who is on their side, just knows a bit more than they do. Won&#039;t always work but when it does, it&#039;ll be you reaching the same results and without lies or subterfuge.","time":1493477253,"resto":123337557,"id":"D8wSFFOt","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":123339916,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)10:50:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123337965\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123337965<\/a><br>This is some good advice, appreciate it.

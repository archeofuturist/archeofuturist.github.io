This way of life suggests ideas that run directly against theirs, and provides excellent lead into basic understanding of nationalism, with family as the smallest social group and basic block of society. Not one based on some religious or philosophical meandering that hardly anyone understands, but one based on simple economic and practical considerations that say &quot;it&#039;s good for you and everyone else, because as long as no one really fucks up, it works out great for everyone, and everyone saves money that would be spent on other people doing the same thing, treating your family like shit if they are unlucky&quot;.<br><br>Hear that libertarians?

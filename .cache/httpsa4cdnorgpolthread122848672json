He can barely sing his own songs. It was nice of him to do tributes to Prince though. <br><br>Random Prince fact: Stevie Nicks came up with &quot;Stand Back&quot; while listening to &quot;Little Red Corvette&quot; in the car. She went home, called Prince and told him about it. He showed up to her place 20 minutes later, produced the song, played synthesizer and all these other instruments, and they completed the song right then and there. I don&#039;t even like that song by Stevie, but I just think that&#039;s a bad ass move by him. He wasn&#039;t even friends with her at the time. He just loves music so she showed up. <br><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/aoBRc54Q0K0","time":1493185378,"resto":122848672,"id":"yo3e7x2u","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122849812,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)01:42:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122849578\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122849578<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Jeb = John Ellis Bush<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Jeb Bush = John Ellis Bush Bush<\/span><br>JUST","filename":"4179FEjwl6L","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":436,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":109,"tim":1493185379221,"time":1493185379,"md5":"c\/YAMjQLvOnokCX4ss6\/mw==","fsize":31098,"resto":122848672,"id":"fHpyyGGP","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122849814,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)01:43:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122849244\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122849244<\/a><br>Tomorrow there will be articles about how &quot;I know ISIS are bad guys, but this is horribly disrespectful to their religion&quot;","time":1493185381,"resto":122848672,"id":"GeKt4v92","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122849847,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)01:43:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122849688\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122849688<\/a><br>I still don&#039;t see what you&#039;re getting at.","filename":"1492618003487m","ext":".jpg","w":722,"h":1024,"tn_w":88,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493185399464,"time":1493185399,"md5":"rSmY0x0ZT1biJ8seFqSwXg==","fsize":198206,"resto":122848672,"id":"8wyjPGnZ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122849849,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)01:43:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122849514\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122849514<\/a><br><br>It makes no sense.","filename":"1481744456844","ext":".jpg","w":750,"h":1000,"tn_w":93,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493185400804,"time":1493185400,"md5":"g3Mk6SgWwPbJiaSMFOUI+w==","fsize":282088,"resto":122848672,"id":"idVooac+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122849854,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)01:43:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Paul Ryan on Friday<\/span>","filename":"1490754569812","ext":".jpg","w":2391,"h":2691,"tn_w":111,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493185402273,"time":1493185402,"md5":"ChzdQaNBPZ5gSy4RNo5sTQ==","fsize":1424272,"resto":122848672,"id":"GLMzrGNs","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":122849856,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)01:43:23","name":"NNTNN","com":"<a href=\"#p122849671\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122849671<\/a><br>He also said, &quot;And I would tell them to go fuck themselves&quot;, which actually boosted him.","time":1493185403,"resto":122848672,"id":"kRE\/OQ9F","country":"US","trip":"!3w4PgysBRY","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122849858,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)01:43:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122849485\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122849485<\/a><br><br>Mustaches<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;prerequisite for becoming a Drug Lord<\/span>","filename":"1463560897674","ext":".jpg","w":175,"h":288,"tn_w":75,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493185405263,"time":1493185405,"md5":"hQa9E4L\/frXA7PcQjv0mEQ==","fsize":8299,"resto":122848672,"id":"TGba1xCk","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122849867,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)01:43:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122849513\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122849513<\/a><br>ginsberg, umm that mexican bitch sotomoron?, who else?","time":1493185410,"resto":122848672,"id":"YTim5seo","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122849895,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)01:43:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122849671\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122849671<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;enemies crawl out of the walls<\/span>","filename":"10-20-16 When the Redpill Hits","ext":".gif","w":225,"h":249,"tn_w":112,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493185429070,"time":1493185429,"md5":"ig5wYAHWVW0BWcSUnEvQAg==","fsize":827614,"resto":122848672,"id":"KE6OP2A+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122849905,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)01:43:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122849714\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122849714<\/a><br>It would be a new golden age.

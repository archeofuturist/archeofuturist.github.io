He can barely sing his own songs. It was nice of him to do tributes to Prince though. <br><br>Random Prince fact: Stevie Nicks came up with &quot;Stand Back&quot; while listening to &quot;Little Red Corvette&quot; in the car. She went home, called Prince and told him about it. He showed up to her place 20 minutes later, produced the song, played synthesizer and all these other instruments, and they completed the song right then and there. I don&#039;t even like that song by Stevie, but I just think that&#039;s a bad ass move by him. He wasn&#039;t even friends with her at the time.

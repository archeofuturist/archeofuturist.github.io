I went to r\/politics and found a thread about Trump repealing this executive order. I read the entire article and then read the entire comments section.<br><br>The article is about how Ivanka Trump is greedy and doesn&#039;t help women. Eventually the Executive Order is mentioned, and how Ivanka didn&#039;t stop it.<br><br>So what is the EO about? I went to the comment section and thought I would find people talking about the implications of the repeal. However, the comments just call her a cunt and talk about how terrible she is. <br><br>No one mentions the EO. Not how it was a good order, not how it was bad. In fact there was very little dissenting opinion at all and almost no information of any value was exchanged over the course of 157 comments<br><br>I looked into the order myself and found that it prevents contractors from holding government contractors over $500k if they have violated other acts and orders in the past 3 years. But I&#039;m not a lawyer, and I read through the order and a couple acts casually. <br><br>Was repealing the order a good move? What are\/were the implications of this move and of the order itself?","filename":"Screen Shot 2017-04-04 at 9.16.10 PM","ext":".png","w":553,"h":271,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":122,"tim":1491360130757,"time":1491360130,"md5":"GV3a9wQeMWtAanH4YLKk3g==","fsize":33574,"resto":0,"id":"7eE7tBGj","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"fair-pay-and-safe-workplaces","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

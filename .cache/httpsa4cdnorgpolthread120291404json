American accents were cool and attractive. American kids were cool and smiled a lot. American grown ups were wise and patient with down home common sense and a relaxed easy demeanour. Exciting things came from America like rockets and cool TV shows. American movies illustrated and explained the world to my young mind and MTV was constantly interesting.

Life is a fucking grind where you have to work two jobs just to keep your head above water. Your politicians are venal self serving bastards. Your police are trigger happy FOOLS and if you stop at a traffic light someone might try to jack your car and leave you for dead in a poverty stricken, crakhead infested neighbourhood full of guns and psychos.

Have you ever been attacked just for having an opinion?<br><br>I started out shitposting and making Trump memes. I seriously keep to myself. I don&#039;t make flyers or stickers and hang them around. I just use \/pol\/ and talk politics with friends.<br><br>I convinced this kid I went to school with to vote for trump (this kid doesn&#039;t know shit about politics or current events). He works with this guy who is a member of antifa. Apparently he told him I&#039;m a trump supporter (not knowing what the fuck antifa is)<br><br>Well the antifa guy told my friend that I&#039;m a literal nazi\/racist, patriarchal-capitalist and that I support pedophiles (who is john podesta you dumb fuck)??? He also said he wants to punch me (because hurr durr punch all naziiiis)<br><br>The hilarious part is he said my (barely right of center) gf was a nazi too. She&#039;s never been called such a word. I can tell she never thought she&#039;d be in a position like this, neither did I a year ago.<br><br>So yeah, I&#039;m being targeted by antifa now. Never thought about joining a political group before but these guys roam in packs and want to harm us. There is strength in numbers and this city is falling apart. I need people who have my back.<br><br>Identity Evropa looks pretty good. Any advice on groups to join or stories that are similar?

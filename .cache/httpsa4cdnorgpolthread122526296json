Of course she did the &quot;OH THEY DO THE JOBS WE WON&#039;T!&quot; shit, but she also brought up Alabama.<br><br>Allegedly (And I do remember hearing something about this) Alabama made it a concerted point to get all the migrant farmers out, and succeeded. And then, allegedly, nobody took up the jobs or farmed, so they had to go get them back or something.<br><br>What&#039;s the real story on that? Because that has to be bullshit or have a whole hell of a lot of caveats attached.<br><br>Also, let&#039;s just talk the economic effects of illegal immigration in America in general. Of course there&#039;s the families using welfare and all. That being said, what does it do to the labor market? I have a pretty general understanding of it, but between that story and how everyone talks, I cannot fathom how the left can defend it at all outside hollow old platitudes and emotions.<br><br>tl;dr: We deport all the &quot;migrant workers&quot; who are so supposedly important, the lefties piss and moan, maybe we even penalize or jail all employers who supported them.

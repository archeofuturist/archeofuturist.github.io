Whoever you are and however long you&#039;ve been on here know this. The same thing happened to bush. He had the advantage of blind nationalistic support back then because there wasn&#039;t much of an internet know how of kike trickery. Look how that ended up. Look at what it did to the right for the last decade. Look at the god damn twitter response to it. Those alt light alt right dorks are all in agreement. Everyone here anon or rebbitor please do not blindly support Trump. If he lets the neocons do as they wish and bends to their will he can pound sand for all I care, I will work with whoever and whatever to tarnish him and burn him to the ground. Trump is a hair away from betraying all of us, don&#039;t end up like the neocons. Don&#039;t repeat their mistakes. We need to use every ounce of meme magic and word of mouth internet power to tell him not to go through with it. He prides himself on knowing we&#039;re with him and that his voter base likes what he&#039;s doing. If he cucks out on Syria we have to fight with every fiber in our being to end him and burn him to the ground. I know a lot of first time voter Trump supporters are probably going to leave retarded replies like sad!, Fake news!, or shill or blah blah so be it. Everyone else, complain, post, tweet, make calls, for christ sake do something. If Trump fucks with Assad and gets involved with Syria we are fucked six ways to sunday.","filename":"Molymeme and the final argument","ext":".png","w":551,"h":627,"tn_w":219,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491510803311,"time":1491510803,"md5":"4cFQPr5UK7Zppgb9gl1fmQ==","fsize":473495,"resto":0,"id":"ZwgiA2YN","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"dont-fall-for-their-tricks","country_name":"United States","replies":21,"images":4,"unique_ips":17},{"no":119791854,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)16:44:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119790372\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119790372<\/a><br>of course.

Wouldn&#039;t the land value tax (LVT) increase the price of land?<br>No, because it would neither increase demand nor decrease supply. Henry George explained it best when he wrote: <br><br>&quot;There could be no limit whatever to prices did the fixing of them rest entirely upon the seller. To the price which will be given and received for anything, two wants must concur\u2014the want or will of the buyer, and the want or will of the seller. The one wants to give as little as he can, the other to get as much as he can, and the point at which the exchange will take place is the point where these two desires come to a balance or effect a compromise. In other words, price is determined by the equation of supply and demand. And, evidently, taxation cannot affect price unless it affects the relative power of one or other of the elements of this equation. The mere wish of the seller to get more, the mere wish of the buyer to pay less, can neither raise nor lower prices. Nothing will raise prices unless it either decreases supply or increases demand. Nothing will lower prices unless it either increases supply or decreases demand. Now, the taxation of land values\u2026neither increases the demand for land nor decreases the supply of land, and therefore cannot increase the price that the landowner can get from the user. Thus it is impossible for landowners to throw such taxation on land users by raising rents. Other things being unaltered, rents would be no higher than before, while the selling price of land, which is determined by net rents, would be much diminished.&quot; [Emphasis mine] -- Why the Landowner Cannot Shift the Tax on Land Values, pp. 2-3<br><br>continued....","filename":"marxandfriedmanonthesamepage","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":480,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1493865351442,"time":1493865351,"md5":"jQcX\/dlW8Ly0ZxJ3JYAGYg==","fsize":62972,"resto":123979374,"id":"e1RuWTSq","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124005349,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)22:35:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124004431\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124004431<\/a><br>Wouldn&#039;t it be better to have a social stigma attached to it instead?

Because no one can produce wealth in the first place unless he or she first has access to land. Consequently, since all land is legally occupied, and since producing more land isn&#039;t an option, those who don&#039;t have titles to land cannot legally access the earth -- and thus cannot legally sustain their own lives -- unless they first &quot;consent&quot; to pay a portion of their earnings to those who do have titles to land.

The problem with this argument becomes evident when they are presented with the scenario of a tenant no longer able to pay a titleholder for the value of the land he is using, and then asked whether or not it would be legitimate to use force to remove the tenant from the titleholder&#039;s land. They typically answer yes to this question, and when pressed for an explanation, finally concede that yes, there is such a thing as a legitimate use of force when it comes to upholding a rightful debt.<br><br>The dispute, then, is not over whether force, in and of itself, is right or wrong, but whether the debt in question is right or wrong -- i.e., whether or not the taxation of rent conflicts with the libertarian principle that each person has property in himself and, by extension, in the fruits of his labor. Geolibertarians hold that it does not so conflict, since rent, as mentioned before, is not a return to labor.","filename":"60614","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":325,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":81,"tim":1493865897804,"time":1493865897,"md5":"yvICFrUjjQmgiPzah7YUKQ==","fsize":55771,"resto":123979374,"id":"e1RuWTSq","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124006549,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)22:45:44","name":"taxation is wrong since it involves the use of force.","com":"<a href=\"#p124006451\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124006451<\/a><br>Rent is in fact a return to land, meaning the percentage of one&#039;s income one could receive simply by renting out the land one holds to someone else.

If they hung onto it, they would be out of pocket by the annual rental value. Putting it to productive use would result in a dramatic increase in demand for labour and therefore an increase in trade and thus in the general welfare. Getting rid of it would result in the asking price for land dropping substantially to the point where supply exceeded demand, with the seller getting progressively more desperate to sell and thus avoid the site rent.<br>In the end, land price is replaced by land value, as represented by the Site Rental.

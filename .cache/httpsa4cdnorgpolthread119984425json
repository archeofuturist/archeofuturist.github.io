Here&#039;s how you convert people on this retarded board. Arguments and discussions only work with people who want to have arguments and discussions. This is not the place for such things. <br><br>Since there are a shit ton of edgy male teenagers, you need memes of your opponents like memeball and shit. This will get their attention and make them doubt their position. <br><br>You also need pictures with a million graphs and list a million sources. This stops all arguments against your position because it overwhelms the other person and there&#039;s practically no chance for them unless they go through all your sources but by that time, the thread is already archived. <br><br>You also need a mascot that you use for everything like christ-chan. Edgy teenagers will be more open to your ideas if you have an attractive 2D girl to go along with your posts. It becomes attractive <br> because you associate your movement with something they already like. Their brain will start to associate your movement with anime and victories for your movement will become a victory for their 2D girl. <br><br><br>This is how the alt-right folks did it and that&#039;s how you do it.","time":1491588096,"resto":119984425,"id":"1bmIVfJZ","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119994008,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)14:09:30","name":"Anonymous","filename":"1484956143503","ext":".jpg","w":1000,"h":1163,"tn_w":107,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491588570388,"time":1491588570,"md5":"RWKP4CoQSy+bgTAdQsOMxw==","fsize":230362,"resto":119984425,"id":"raVwhKJl","country":"ES","m_img":1,"country_name":"Spain"},{"no":119994875,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)14:14:41","name":"Anonymous","filename":"1491423685705","ext":".png","w":1785,"h":2537,"tn_w":87,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491588881960,"time":1491588881,"md5":"Z84OnTKLGxbpiyvYSHRtsw==","fsize":403158,"resto":119984425,"id":"raVwhKJl","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":119995284,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)14:16:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119990055\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119990055<\/a><br>Here&#039;s an exemple of something that works super well.

Some of the younger people have been indoctrinated by cultural marxism but most laugh at SJW&#039;s.<br><br>My favourite arguments are bringing up how first generation migrants often self-segregate into communities and raise their children based on their original cultures values and therefore will never be fully integrated into society.<br>How immigrants can make 10 times what they would make in their home country by coming to the west and living off welfare so why wouldn&#039;t they?<br>How bringing in swathes of low skill people from the third world is extremely dangerous seeing as how the housing market is fucked throughout europe, the economy is unstable and overpopulation could become an issue in the near future <br>Also pointing out the barbarism of Islam and how almost all muslim majority countries are authoritarian hellholes which treat women like second class citizens (this triggers the feminists) <br>Bringing up how socialist\/communist countries have either under-performed or collapsed consistently throughout history the only counter argument here is &quot;but it wasnt real communism&quot; which is false. <br>My favorite and irrefutable point is how letting in all these migrants will never solve the problems in the countries which they emigrate from so it&#039;s merely a short fix to a worldwide problem for a tiny minority of the people afflicted by it and it&#039;s foolish to think that somehow it makes a positive impact.","filename":"1470277702189","ext":".jpg","w":250,"h":250,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490074017234,"time":1490074017,"md5":"3sjTi1eh5AaD5ousYsYpdQ==","fsize":11998,"resto":117588160,"id":"3Bg5C7Go","country":"IS","country_name":"Iceland"},{"no":117592818,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)01:35:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117592123\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117592123<\/a><br>One day, you may take in white Brit and Swede refugees.

People on the right are so psychologically conditioned into accepting the narrative of the left that just a hint of conservatism was all it took for them to lose all sense of perspective. Were Trump&#039;s vision of America to be fully realized he would essentially just wind back the clock of degeneracy to approximately the late 1980s. Nothing has changed with Trump. Absolutely NOTHING! <br><br>America in fucking 1969 was a million times more conservative than Trump will ever dare go. Trump is merely slowing down a process that is still moving forward. The fact that supposed neo-Nazis are worshiping Trump shows just how psychologically broken white people are... Grasping at straws...

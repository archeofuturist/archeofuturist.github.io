What a fucking shit show!Try explaining to people how you&#039;re &quot;defending freedom&quot; by sitting in an lp\/op with a poppy field below you and a police station that rapes little &quot;dancing boys&quot; 500 meters from you and you cant do shit about it.<br><br><br>Anyways..<br>I have no idea where it hit but I mean when you drop a 10ton+ bomb on people its going to fuck them up. I hope it&#039;s just mostly on a tunnel complex because if in a village...fuck.Even in a qalat in a rural area they all live together. It&#039;s a multi-generational fortress. You have maybe a couple taliban and their wives,kids,cousins,parents,etc<br><br><br>The absolutely most insane thing about afghanistan is that alot of the times a few HOURS outside of the cities they have no fucking clue whats going on or why soldiers are there. Imagine being an old afghan guy that fought the soviets in the 80s. Now he has a bunch of kids and grandkids and he sees soldiers,once again,coming into his country.He&#039;s thinking &quot;my father- fathers -father &#039;s land. I&#039;ll fight anyone who tries to dominate \/rule over me&quot; He&#039;s fighting for his whole family and his tribe. It&#039;s a pride thing. It&#039;s the same reason alot of afghans fight any foreigners,including isis. They just want to be left alone. It&#039;s weak government and the fact that it has trillions of dollars worth of resources means its going to be messed with for a very long time to come.<br><br><br>They&#039;re a tough,strong, proud people.<br> The average 15 year old kid could whoop the average 25 year old in the west. These kids do hard manual labor (farm boys)for hours and hours a day since the time they are llittle kids.<br><br>Dropping multi-million dollar bombs on an enemy who will never even come close to inflicting that much in monetary damage on you is just hilarious. <br><br>It&#039;s like sinking an inflatable fishin boat in a lake with a 20mm cannon.","filename":"moab-comp","ext":".gif","w":727,"h":563,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":193,"tim":1492123675698,"time":1492123675,"md5":"ZJzQOdI5VvgHcTdUMopkeg==","fsize":51876,"resto":0,"id":"eFwGSksT","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"a-response-to-a-dude-re-afghanistan-moab","country_name":"United States","replies":8,"images":1,"unique_ips":8},{"no":120976737,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)18:49:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120976575\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120976575<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;It&#039;s like sinking an inflatable fishin boat in a lake with a 20mm cannon.<\/span><br><br>You have to talk loudly when you&#039;re speaking to multiple entities at once.","time":1492123754,"resto":120976575,"id":"sPjpjSb0","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120977792,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)18:57:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"Reddit: The post","filename":"1491","ext":".jpg","w":630,"h":630,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492124244810,"time":1492124244,"md5":"L9hDBNfw0qWhaW3gBA+mBQ==","fsize":43830,"resto":120976575,"id":"nfee1SZX","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120977920,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)18:58:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120976575\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120976575<\/a><br><br>What does a firecracker like that COST?","time":1492124312,"resto":120976575,"id":"foFo3J9+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120978019,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)18:59:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"Is this bait?

In Germany, meme degrees are very competitive - it&#039;s free, but you have to be at the very top to be able to study it, there is no easy coasting through school degree. Non-meme, difficult degrees are also free and everyone is allowed to sign up for it, but most people quit or fail out. I like this system a lot, I think the result is that all degrees remain high value.","time":1493397435,"resto":123208216,"id":"onKJAlzz","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":123213675,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)12:39:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123208216\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123208216<\/a><br>i went into nursing for 4 years, debt of like 25k and paid that shit off in 2 years, now im just finishing up my car and buying guns, feels good earning 75k for 2 years of experience","filename":"received_m_mid_1390827272397_2dea61c28d10cf3398_0","ext":".jpg","w":920,"h":575,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":78,"tim":1493397596440,"time":1493397596,"md5":"bMVaaTMPuI68+x4Yd+EJhQ==","fsize":32075,"resto":123208216,"id":"VxnVB+d\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123213756,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)12:40:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"I have never met a single person under the age of 50 who attended college and did not suffer from the following effects:<br><br>1) turned more liberal<br>2) became more close-minded <br>3) became more accepting of degeneracy<br>4) became less willing to be educated<br>5) became more Godless<br>6) became more degenerate themselves<br>7) became arrogant and thus incapable of understanding their own flaws and correcting them<br><br><br>Honestly, I hear people who say: &quot;I&#039;m going to go to college!&quot; <br><br>and I think to myself: &quot;You&#039;re dumb.&quot;","filename":"1474076151352","ext":".png","w":338,"h":339,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493397642244,"time":1493397642,"md5":"zLsUP2FfOWTYeCEq057KyQ==","fsize":17292,"resto":123208216,"id":"E8s56cQ4","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123214082,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)12:43:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"Only if you&#039;re going into a STEM field.","time":1493397822,"resto":123208216,"id":"uQjR18pT","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123214084,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)12:43:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123208216\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123208216<\/a><br>Don&#039;t get a useless degree and it&#039;s not a big deal.

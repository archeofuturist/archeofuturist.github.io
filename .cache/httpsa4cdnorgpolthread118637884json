What many in Northern Ireland fail to realize, is that Protestants occupy quite a lot of positions in power in the South, be it in Medicine, Law, or Banking. King&#039;s Hospital school, for example has some of the best performing graduates. As does TCD (which last time I heard still has disproportionately larger Protestant community).<br><br>So, in my experience it was a non-issue heritage wise, so long as someone was proud to be Irish, all things included.

There seems to have been a period were a lot of semi-wealthy English people moved there, and they treat the locals with contempt. Oddly enough, these people are called the &quot;hippies&quot; because they came in the 70s. From what I understood, they full deserved all the locals dislike.","time":1490700990,"resto":118637884,"id":"4BbAe64H","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"}]}

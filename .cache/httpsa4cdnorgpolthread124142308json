People were zooming into one of the images in the previous thread and saying that it photoshopped because of some compression artifacts. The same is circulating on French twitter now in many tweets:<br><br>https:\/\/twitter.com\/TurcanMarie\/sta<wbr>tus\/860039829907787776<br><br>I am attaching higher quality versions of the previously shown pages in this thread.<br><br>I want to say sorry for the snafu, I had a little problems with our source. He is not a technical guy and decided to copypaste them into a pdf, and the high default jpeg compression wrecked the image.<br><br>The media keeps repeating Macron&#039;s &quot;I don&#039;t have an account in the Bahamas&quot; line over and over again. He&#039;s right, he doesn&#039;t. He has one in the Caymans, as these documents prove.<br><br>further document analysis here:<br>http:\/\/gotnews.com\/emmanuel-macrons<wbr>-tax-evasion-documents-real\/<br><br>French people: Give us time. We will soon have swiftnet logs going back months and will eventually decode Macron&#039;s web of corruption.

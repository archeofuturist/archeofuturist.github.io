The (((white helmets))) didn&#039;t use protective clothing which would cause a lot of deaths if the sarin attack just happened there.<br>2. The impact site of the sarin attack contains an artillery shell and not something that was delivered by an airplane.<br>3. The number of deaths is very low for an actual military grade sarine attack which would kill hundreds if not thousands. Sarin is very deadly and Assad used it as deterence against Izrael since he didn&#039;t have nukes. The low number of deaths implies that the Russian scenario (the sarine was in a rebel warehouse that was destroyed) or a falseflag scenario (rebels have a primitive way of delivering the substance or perhaps the bodies were delivered from somewhere else).<br><br>Now in general it&#039;s hard to find out what surely happened we can conclude that Assad did not fire the shell since it&#039;s not tilted in that direction, but in direction of the rebels. Furthermore, the artillery shell is not fired from an airplane as it is accused.

Only just got home tonight because I was there on holiday. I was pretty deep into the crowd and we didn&#039;t know what was going on. Looking back you could see and hear people yelling and pushing forward then suddenly people were running. I started running just because I heard the screams, I didn&#039;t even know the car was coming at first. We were just running down the road but pretty soon you could actually hear the car, like you could hear the engine and then the thumps as it made contact. By this point it was loud as fuck and I was running as fast as I could but some fat fuck in front of me decked it and I went down with her. On the pavement I turned over and I could see the car coming towards me and the police were already firing shots by this point into the windscreen but it was still moving forward. I genuinely thought I was going to die then and there and I just closed my eyes. The car was still going under inertia and it rolled right up to me. As the 20 tonnes of steel and glass bore down upon me I could feel the heat of the rubber tires between my legs as they rolled agonisingly over both of my soft bollocks; popping them like boiled eggs.","time":1490271836,"resto":117924354,"id":"898EbzHu","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":117924856,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)08:24:06","name":"Designated Leftist","com":"<a href=\"#p117924705\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117924705<\/a><br>Right Racist, that&#039;s it.

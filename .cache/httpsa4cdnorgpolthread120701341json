Before i started going to church, i experienced several times why having faith is so beneficial. Its spiritual, but its also saved me from making naive and selfish decisions that has helped me become more of a man. learn to love, live in harmony, have sexual modesty, respect, and learn what it means to be a protector.

So what was Jesus teaching? Zoroastrianism. And there&#039;s evidence of this in Scripture. When Jesus was on the cross next to the two thieves, he said to the repentant thief: &quot;Today you will be with me in paradise.&quot; (Luke 23:43). What&#039;s interesting here is that the Jews do not view the afterlife or &quot;Heaven&quot; to be like a paradise. The Jews believe when you die you go to Sheol - a place of darkness that exists literally in the ground. Jesus was revolutionary when he taught about Heaven. So what about &quot;paradise?&quot; The word originates in the Avestan language, which happens to be the holy language Zoroaster used when he wrote the Avesta (basically the Bible of Zoroastrianism).

It was the consensus of this meeting that it would be dangerous to arrest Jesus in public because of his hold upon the affections of the common people. It was also the opinion of the majority that a determined effort should be made to discredit him in the eyes of the multitude before he should be arrested and brought to trial. Accordingly, several groups of learned men were designated to be on hand the next morning in the temple to undertake to entrap him with difficult questions and otherwise to seek to embarrass him before the people.

We are only students, and we would know the truth about a matter which troubles us; our difficulty is this: Is it lawful for us to give tribute to Caesar?

Show me the tribute money, and I will answer you.\u201d And when they handed him a denarius, he looked at it and said, \u201cWhose image and superscription does this coin bear?\u201d And when they answered him, \u201cCaesar\u2019s,\u201d Jesus said, \u201cRender to Caesar the things that are Caesar\u2019s and render to God the things that are God\u2019s.\u201d","time":1491972315,"resto":120701341,"id":"gMgi1sTJ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120715246,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)00:46:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120713968\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120713968<\/a><br>Religion is an ideal.

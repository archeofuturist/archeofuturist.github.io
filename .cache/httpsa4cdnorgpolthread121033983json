Atheists have the same morals as society does. Religious people subscribe to a strict set of morals and want to steal the concept of morality to only belong to their group of people, like you are doing. They want to impose that morality on others and on society itself, without any self-reflection allowed. Regardless of what morality is, regardless of the existence of other sets of moralities - other religions - there&#039;s only one set of morals they believe in, because it&#039;s preordained. This is why sharia law exists in some countries, because their society have been successfully overtaken by religious morality. A secular state is the only way to protect the people from the overreach by religious groups whether their set of morals are innocuous or nefarious.<br><br>Further, to state that &#039;any&#039; morals are based on facts is always wrong, because if you reduce the concept and distance it from society, it has lost it&#039;s meaning. Something to expect, given the definition of morality. The notion of morality is defined by society as much as the notion of benefit is by society. It simply cannot exist without living beings with higher conciousness willing it to be. <br><br>A higher conciousness does not mean a human conciousness. We know for a fact that animals experience morality. They set boundaries for themselves and others. If this were not true, dogs would not be man&#039;s best friend. How arrogant is it then for religious interests to hijack the very concept of morality to only belong to a specific group of loosely defined humans.<br><br>Of course, morals are not what defines how good of a person you are, as morals are easily broken. What defines a good person is something else entirely, which is the level of support one shows for their society. Whether you are a person representing vested interests of a religious group, or a person who simply doesn&#039;t care about spirituality, both are capable of good and evil.","filename":"1379022888158","ext":".jpg","w":400,"h":400,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492162919528,"time":1492162919,"md5":"xnpeBeI\/Gw3DbCGx1L9wLw==","fsize":91578,"resto":121033983,"id":"BB7xP9LO","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":121042067,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)05:42:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121041046\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121041046<\/a><br><br>most atheists exhibit a character like that of a spolit child and it makes sense when you remember that, like a good father(which is what God symbolises), God doesn&#039;t give you what you want, only what you need.","filename":"tcp","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":500,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492162933363,"time":1492162933,"md5":"UCqeSrgyVrs+37Dm5Sa78Q==","fsize":193972,"resto":121033983,"id":"hHRMU+Zd","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":121042090,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)05:42:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121041932\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121041932<\/a><br>I&#039;ve read everything there is to read about it, it always leads me to the same conclusion, the phyiscal world is a prison made by an insane control freak God who likes to see war destruction pestilence abd disease.

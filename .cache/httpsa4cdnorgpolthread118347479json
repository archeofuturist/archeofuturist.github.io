That is now slowly ebbing off and then there&#039;s Peterson on the rise. Naturally he&#039;s going to lose some viewers.<br><br>Molymeme is a well spoken and informed news anchor \/ radio host. He presents (sometimes) interesting topics and facts. <br><br>Peterson though operates on a whole different level. The guy really knows whats fucking with western civilization right now.

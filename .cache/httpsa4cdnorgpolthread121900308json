The Orbital Ring that he conceived of can be built today, with existing technology. In addition to terrestrial transportation, the Orbital Ring would drastically reduce the cost of sending payloads to space, from $2000\/kg to $1\/kg.<br><br>This would enable your childhood dreams to become real. Terraforming and colonies on the Moon and Mars. Middle class families could take vacations on another planet. An end to climate change through space-based solar power.

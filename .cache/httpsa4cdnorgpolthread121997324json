I myself am in a same-sex couple and there have been many advances in this area,&quot; Cedric explains.<br><br>&quot;But for me there are more pressing issues like the economy, the national debt and unemployment.&quot;<br><br>We ask him if he&#039;s worried about LGBT rights and, like most of the FN supporters we speak to, he thinks the same-sex marriage thing is a bluff: a ploy to win conservative votes.<br><br>It&#039;s a view that&#039;s at least partially backed up by the facts. Counter-intuitively, the Front National has more high level gay figures than any other major party, people like Marine Le Pen&#039;s closest adviser Florian Philippot.<br><br>Cedric, for one, is prepared to take the risk.<br><br>&quot;In my view, she won&#039;t do it. If the FN were to win, I think she would prioritise other things.&quot;<br><br>Polls suggest the party is now more popular in the LGBT community than perhaps many would want to admit.<br><br>Of the 3,200 gay French men the dating app Hornet spoke to, one in five said they would be giving Marine Le Pen their vote.<br><br>Other polling in the aftermath of the 2015 regional elections suggested the FN was more popular among married gay men than the general population.<br><br>So what is it about Marine Le Pen that appeals directly to some LGBT voters? For many, it&#039;s her tough stance on immigration.<br><br>&quot;Where are the gays most in danger?

The left is the idea that things have to be -made- equal through giving more rights to people they see to be disadvantaged, redistributing wealth to give more to the poor and\/or tax the rich higher and usually having a government that can control the market in order to make these happen. Right is the idea that although people aren&#039;t really born equal, but they should have equal opportunities in life based on merit. There shouldn&#039;t be any laws that favour one person to another, tax and welfare programs etc should either be cut or abolished altogether and the market should be as free and competitive as possible.","time":1493268874,"resto":122993853,"id":"r3c\/9931","country":"HU","country_name":"Hungary"},{"no":122997747,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)01:01:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122993853\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122993853<\/a><br>It&#039;s a heuristic that changes over time and provides a superficial way of judging peoples superficial political leanings.<br><br>Depending on context and who is saying it left and right mean somewhat different things, and most people think of being towards the centre as good so use &quot;far-x&quot; as a means of denigrating those they oppose.","time":1493269285,"resto":122993853,"id":"QsaZ+WZs","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"}]}

Launch Loop Master Race.","com":"Faggots keep coming in here and talking about building an Orbital Ring. It would cost $500 billion, and cut your launch costs from $2000\/kg to $1\/kg. <br><br>A Launch Loop would cost $30 billion and cut your launch costs to $3\/kg. $30 billion is NASA&#039;s annual budget. Way easier to pull of politically.<br><br>They both reduce your costs by orders of magnitude,but a Launch Loop is cheaper and easier to engineer. Once it&#039;s up, we could put your homosexual Orbital Ring up for another $20 billion or so.<br><br>The Launch Loop still lets you mine asteroids and earn trillions of dollars, and it still lets you produce space-based solar power for under 1c\/kwh.That&#039;s so cheap they pay for themselves with 2-3 years. So, throw up about $3 trillion of satellites, and by year 3 you can abolish federal income tax.<br><br>Orbital Rings are for fags.

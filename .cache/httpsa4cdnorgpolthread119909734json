Still, it&#039;s more than his immediate predecessors George W. Bush or Bill Clinton, both of whom were golfers as well.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The 306 rounds over eight years averages out to a little more than 38 rounds a year, which is well above the national average of 19.3, according to figures provided by the National Golf Foundation (NGF).<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Obama falls into the category of the &quot;avid golfer,&quot; which the NGF defines as golfers who play more than 25 rounds a year. Only 2.1 percent of the entire US population is an avid golfer, and only 25.6 percent of golfers play that often.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Speaking of Obama&#039;s frenetic schedule as Commander-in-Chief, it&#039;s worth noting that he stepped up his playing considerably in his second term, averaging 47.5 rounds between 2013-16, compared to 27 rounds in the previous terms. Not surprisingly, Obama&#039;s quietest year on the course was 2012, which was the year he was asking the American public if he could keep his job.<\/span>","filename":"Obama-Biden-White-House","ext":".jpg","w":780,"h":520,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1491551625230,"time":1491551625,"md5":"JASBptOfcBhsaKYt2ozIMg==","fsize":133663,"resto":119909734,"id":"5Qy+o1V7","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"}]}

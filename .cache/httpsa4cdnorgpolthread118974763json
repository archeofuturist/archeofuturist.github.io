The teachers force-feeding your children Marxist and SJW agendas were once students of the professors in these universities. Prominent Marxists such as Castro, Obama, Che, Mao, Clinton - all trace their political roots to these universities. Guess who heads these universities.<br><br>The university system serves two purposes - to indoctrinate and to indebt. Congratulations on earning that piece of paper; all you gained was a massive debt and a Marxist rewiring. Globalist\/Jewish interests absolutely LOVE this system to serve both needs so easily, under the guise of &quot;higher education.&quot; The internet now has freed us.<br><br>Whether you&#039;re a Natsoc, Ancap, Conservacuck, or anyone of the right - the interest to dismantle and change the university system is imperative to saving the West. As daunting as they are, universities are easier to change since they rely more heavily on government subsidies than they&#039;re primary counterparts - you solely need to provide the straws to break the camels back.<br><br>Recent News:<br>http:\/\/www.wnd.com\/2017\/03\/heres-ep<wbr>ic-email-suspended-christian-sent-i<wbr>slamic-prof\/<br><br>Professor watch list<br>http:\/\/www.professorwatchlist.org\/","filename":"rosenberg","ext":".jpg","w":1292,"h":640,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":123,"tim":1490911076611,"time":1490911076,"md5":"7gxdqofo3Oc56G4gF8MNZQ==","fsize":265743,"resto":0,"id":"io67QAcT","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-nervous-center-of-the-left-the-universities","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

It&#039;s a good system that works in hand with human psychology. <br><br>The only problem with our current system of capitalism is the way governments tax it encourages hoarding instead of profit sharing. Rather than taxing the rich more based on how much they earn, we should be taxing people based on what they do with their wealth. IE owners of businesses that pay a fair wage in relation to their profits, making sure to pay their lowest paid worker no more than 50 times less than the highest paid, would end up paying very little in taxes. <br><br>Instead we have this retarded tax system where the rich know they are going to get taxed to shit no matter what, so why the fuck would a CEO pay their workers more when Uncle Sam is already going to rape them? <br><br>All capitalism needs is to have tax codes revised so that higher tax rates specifically target people who hoard profits rather than just blindly targeting everyone based on how much they earn. Capitalism mainly works when money is constantly flowing through a middle class. Hoarding wealth kills it, the money HAS to keep moving or else it&#039;s a net loss for social benefit.<br><br>The best part about this is it would give a huge legup for small businesses since most of them already pay their workers a significant portion of profits, and in some cases even operate at a loss.

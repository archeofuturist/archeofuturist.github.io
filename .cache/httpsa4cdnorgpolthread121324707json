I never really thought about it and it never really bothered me. <br><br>Fast forward to today, my son is about to enroll in AMERICAN football (6th grade) and he is dreading going to the doctor. In his own words, &quot;I don&#039;t want the doc touching my penis so I can catch a ball.&quot; I told him this is the only path forward to play ball. Now I understand that physicals are conducted to examine if the individual possesses a hernia or has any testicular cancer but is it necessary for a 12 year old who hasn&#039;t even lifted weights yet?<br><br>Is there any other underlying reasons \/pol\/ as to why doctors touch your penis during physicals? Is it just the law? Any physicians around?","filename":"Doctor-checking-athlete-knee","ext":".jpg","w":684,"h":1029,"tn_w":166,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492321931448,"time":1492321931,"md5":"RHJOLo6Kju5kC70zzYTzZA==","fsize":149523,"resto":0,"id":"SpGFuN9o","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"physicals-why-does-the-doc-have-to-touch-your","country_name":"United States","replies":3,"images":0,"unique_ips":4},{"no":121324881,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)01:53:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121324707\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121324707<\/a><br>hernia you stupid fuck","time":1492322036,"resto":121324707,"id":"4Lja5mER","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121324975,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)01:54:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121324707\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121324707<\/a><br>Bruh your kid will grow up gay if you say no to penis inspection day","time":1492322097,"resto":121324707,"id":"B4uvgsUL","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121325388,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)01:59:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121324707\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121324707<\/a><br>It&#039;s a physical exam by a doctor. Think of it like when you open wide for a dentist. The doctor checks your whole body for anything that may be wrong.

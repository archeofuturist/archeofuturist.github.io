This misses a crucial point: simply holding semitically incorrect views is inherently predicated on the threat of violence.<br><br>The existing system is designed to keep people like us *out* of power. If you think that (((they))) will voluntarily relinquish power if we play by the rules, you are delusional.<br>Of course, we\u2019re not advocating any unlawful or criminal acts nor should any statement be taken as incitement, threat, or conspiracy to commit any illegal acts.<br><br>But if you have a shrieking masked Commie in your face that is trying to hit you with a flagpole, you are faced with two options:<br><br>1. Getting your ass kicked, doing nothing about it and crying on social media about &quot;muh intolerant Leftists&quot;.<br><br>2. Retaliating by implementing the necessary force to defend yourself.<br><br>Getting beaten up doesn\u2019t make people sympathetic to our cause. They either laughing at you or pitying you. No one follows the defenseless nerd with the KICK ME sign on his back. People don\u2019t rationally evaluate ideas, they internalize memes based on power dynamics.<br><br>What do you think did more for our cause as far as drawing in more moderates?<br><br>When Richard Spencer got sucker-punched in the face and did nothing in return?<br><br>Or when 20 or so TradWorker&#039;s fought off 100-200 anti-fa and hospitalized 10 of them?

Absolutely, if they initiate violence then fight back and kick their asses. But as far as striking first, we have to allow the left to escalate.

At this point, simply having groups of nationalists going around and beating up random Leftists is not going to us any favors. <br><br>But a significant thing has happened since the Trump presidency: the majority of mainstream conservatives have developed an extreme dislike for anti-fa and actively cheer on when they are getting their ass handed to them.<br><br>This is probably a result of anti-fa and the extreme-Left pretending that the likes of Milo, Charles Murray, Gavin McInnes etc are extreme fascists when everybody knows that they are not. Normie Republicans and conservatives now see anti-fa as a group that is using militant tactics against ordinary patriots and Trump supporters and so will be, at the very least, sympathetic to more &quot;extreme&quot; right-wingers who are comfortable using violence. <br><br>I think framing it in the context of American freedoms vs authoritarian Leftists has worked quite well (e.g. calling the Berkeley rally a &quot;free speech rally&quot;).","time":1493000782,"resto":122527099,"id":"2LkbxUpk","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122529533,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)22:33:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"Bump.","time":1493001208,"resto":122527099,"id":"2LkbxUpk","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"}]}

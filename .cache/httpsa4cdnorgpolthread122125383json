Every society in the world is built on violence, or the implied threat of violence. All laws in all governments in the world are enforced via violence; that is, if you break the law, cops will find you and forcefully take you to prison. If you resist, you will be hit and restrained until you go with them. You want any semblance of law and order in your country? Bad news, violence is a key ingredient.","time":1492774734,"resto":122125383,"id":"MFJhjotA","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122126643,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)07:39:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122125383\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122125383<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;If I can hire a personal slave, it&#039;s ok if I&#039;m a slave myself<\/span><br>american cuck logic everyone","filename":"1476569616709","ext":".gif","w":320,"h":234,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":91,"tim":1492774797237,"time":1492774797,"md5":"UeJEKfMXzg2kO8iOLeZ3ew==","fsize":1291599,"resto":122125383,"id":"A7JaaybF","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":122126661,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)07:40:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122125383\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122125383<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;hire undocumented immigrant who will send his money out of the country without paying taxes for said country&#039;s communal benefit while using the very same power of the state to pick YOUR pocket so that he can live comfortably while raping little girls because nobody knows who he is<\/span><br>Really made me think.

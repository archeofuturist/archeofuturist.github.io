The info we have of the gas attack leaves a sour taste in many peoples mouths. Why would Assad do it? The whole thing just doesnt make sense. The attack we have seen today itself feels like it had been planned weeks ago. Some of the info about aircraft movements are disturbing as well. We are not getting all the info.<br><br>And think about it this way. Saddam Hussein was a sociopath, but when we toppled him, look at the chaos that was left in his wake. We would just be doing the exact same thing if we removed Assad. A militant islamic government would take over, and the freedoms that are actually afforded to Syrians would disappear. We would be stuck in a much worse situation.<br><br>And if you get really cynical, you could see sowing chaos as a means of creating a refugee crisis that fundamentally alters the politics, culture, and religion of Europe over time. Maybe some people want this to happen... people who want a fast track to a united states of europe, a united europe with real centralized powers.","time":1491546575,"resto":119898642,"id":"Y5Z5JOaT","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119899705,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)02:29:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119898642\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119898642<\/a><br>The lesser of two evils.<br><br>Also, I support chemical weapons.

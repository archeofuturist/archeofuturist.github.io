You&#039;d also want a reliable sidearm with high penetration. .357 is really good. Revolvers and military surplus rifles are the way to go when SHTF. You want range and penetration for people with body armor (also reliability). Cause if you stay in the urban areas at that point and need an AR for hordes of people you&#039;re just an idiot. <br><br>8mm (yugo k98) and 7.62x54 (mosin) will go through most civilian body armor. Also you won&#039;t need to carry around 100s of rounds because you will be firing slower and more accurately (obviously they&#039;re bolt-action). <br><br>As far as .357 (my knowledge is pretty limited when it comes to handguns) I&#039;m almost positive it has the highest penetration without giving up stopping power. .357 would be optimal for home defense as well.

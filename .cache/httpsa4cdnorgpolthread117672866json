Best system possible, except for the fact that those subjected to it can&#039;t be perfect. Same with communism\/socialism\/welfare-niggeri<wbr>sm. Some one will always take advantage of it. For anarchy the obvious thing is crimes go unpunished so crime increases, and of course we need some sort of structure\/leader to tell people what to do. I would argue the superiority of most world leaders\/politcians is lacking, but the ignorant need teachers, the laborers need to be directed where to labor etc. <br>Communism similarly is perfect. Real communism is inherently anarchic, but the only thing we&#039;ve seen is forced, for various reasons this made places like the USSR absolute shit holes. Marx himself knew communism needed capitalism first. I expect we&#039;ll reach real communism at some point when we can achieve a truly and naturally globalized world and culture. This won&#039;t be in our life time, but the world is already homogenizing. At some point as technology improves we&#039;ll all be connected better, we already can talk to anyone anywhere in the world instantly. Think of 100 years ago how they&#039;d marvel and how the telegram and to go a step further even mail in achaemenid persia changed society. Automation will play a big role in this too. We&#039;ll never achieve perfect communism, but we&#039;ll get damn close and without a card carrying party member jamming a gun down our assholes or government prostate exams that reach our throats. Not anytime in our lifetime though. <br>If your brother&#039;s house burned down you would offer him yours for a time.

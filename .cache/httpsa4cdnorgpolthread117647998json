Republicans can&#039;t push abortions because it would look like a bunch of rich white folk trying to kill piles of black babies. The her Body\/Choice issue is actually correct. If you replace the word fetus with tumor, there would be no issue with the removal. Dominion of one&#039;s body should be absolute, as long as one is in control of their faculties. <br><br>The left is pro choice, but not for eugenic reasons. The poor and lower class are breeders. They will simply birth more than the rate of abortion. <br><br>As far as the morality of it, each person is subject to their own moral code. Those who are against abortion, can simply not have abortions. They are not able to project their morals onto others who have no qualm about the act. <br><br>People who say they care about the life of the fetus are the same people who refuse to adopt children that could have easily been aborted.","time":1490118826,"resto":117647998,"id":"RhoE+2r\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117650451,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)14:03:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117647998\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117647998<\/a><br><br>Bah!<br><br>Stop pushing this sickening meme of &quot;life is disposable; promiscuity is a lifestyle, not a disorder&quot;.<br><br>Abortions are necessary under certain circumstances, but I refuse to pay for a woman&#039;s inability to use contraceptives, to remove herself from an abusive environment, or to report her assault and have the assailant removed from her life.<br><br>Vanity abortions are just throwing away soon-to-be perfectly good organs.

In addition to the shared capacity for invading through normal tissues, both cancer cells and cells of the developing placenta create a microenvironment supportive of both immunologic privilege and angiogenesis. Systemic alterations in immunity are also detectable, particularly with respect to a helper T cell type 2 polarization evident in advanced cancers and midtrimester pregnancy.

A little poor shithole that was given self sovereignty, which it should not have been. Everyone here is poor. <br><br>Its mostly all farms and major urban center named Sarajevo. The rest is just small farms. Theres no way a country like this should or can exist! Its too damn poor and unstable without international handouts. <br><br>On top of that EVERYTHING is blamed on America. Oh bad harvest year? America. The people are still upset over the genocide? America. Srebrenica town voted in a Serb mayor? America. We&#039;re poor and our government is too fucking decentralised and we suffer? America. Theres a pro-ISIS village Gornja Mao\u010da!?!?!? Yeah thats Americas fault for letting us bring in foreign fighters. Holy fuck the retardation here is driving me crazy. <br><br>The country cant gets its own affairs in order and blames it all on the west. All the wests fault. The west just sat back and did nothing while Serbs murdered MUHHH 6 MILLION in Srebrenica. Its alllllll Americas fault. <br><br>No one here takes responsibility for shit.","filename":"BUUUSNNNIAHHH","ext":".gif","w":1024,"h":683,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1491475780023,"time":1491475780,"md5":"X3q4KFdU3IsMuquUweBoIg==","fsize":68474,"resto":0,"id":"odSLYpGo","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"i-feel-like-im-going-crazy-here-here-is-a-country","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

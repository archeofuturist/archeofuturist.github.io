We&#039;re actually going to build from scratch a society that embraces both technology and traditional values. You can think of it like a reverse Amish society. The gov-structure will follow some of Curtis Yarvin&#039;s ideas, for this purpose we will create a cryptocurrency. The idea goes as follows:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;1) We will create a cryptocurrency. This crypto will have the same amount of coins as square meters our land (Idea based on the German Rentenmark) This way, our crypto will be the very first one which is backed by actual goods: land.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;2) People who are elegible to live in the MPoK will have to buy those coins, go to the place, and claim a piece of land for whatever size he wants, but he has to trade it for the coins.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;3) Not everybody will be elegible to live there, but even when if you are not elegible you can invest in the MPoK. Also you will be free to speculate with our crypto in an exchange. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;4) How to introduce the crypto is yet to be discussed.<\/span><br><br>5) We have found land as cheap as 10710,41 hectares for 5900000 usd. This means that our crypto will issue the exact amount of 107104100 coins.<br><br>More info on this here: http:\/\/1espzufmsehqffgzbvz3fkwhjzal<wbr>qqatjo.club\/index.php?topic=40.0<br><br>Also and for the land we&#039;ve found, you can have updates here: http:\/\/1espzufmsehqffgzbvz3fkwhjzal<wbr>qqatjo.club\/index.php?topic=2.0<br><br>Now HEY HOL UP, HOL UP, LISTEN, LISTEN, HOL UP fags! <br>We are serious on this, so we need SKILLED PEOPLE... right now we need to know how easy is to create a new settlement in Wyoming (Legally speaking), so if any of you is a Lawyer, it would be appreciated some of your help. <br><br>JOIN THE PROJECT HERE: http:\/\/1espzufmsehqffgzbvz3fkwhjzal<wbr>qqatjo.club\/index.php?action=regist<wbr>er","filename":"1489871476742","ext":".jpg","w":609,"h":550,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":225,"tim":1490639475968,"time":1490639475,"md5":"uKsasWjSBg\/T7Pa+X5KbaQ==","fsize":71986,"resto":0,"id":"9Fadxc7V","country":"ES","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-memetic-principality-of-kek-general-we-need","country_name":"Spain","replies":90,"images":27,"unique_ips":45},{"no":118542609,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)14:32:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118542392\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118542392<\/a><br>The forum can also be accessed with this URL<br>www.memeticprincipalityofkek.club","filename":"iiik-\uac15-proud-citizien-of-kekistan-13602982","ext":".png","w":500,"h":566,"tn_w":110,"tn_h":124,"tim":1490639576397,"time":1490639576,"md5":"uGLiwMfQQeIqGsd2wszmdA==","fsize":173822,"resto":118542392,"id":"9Fadxc7V","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":118543201,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)14:37:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118542392\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118542392<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Curtis Yarvin&#039;s ideas<\/span><br>Mencius Moldbug!

Even when they know there can be some restrictions, like criminal background, or political beliefs, they see this as a speculative way to profit. They see the piece of land very cheap and they know that as the town is built the price of the coins will SOAR because the town will have better services, more people... but also the coins will be more and more scarce, because they will be destroyed as people claim territory. (Please think on this).<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;This leads us to the fact that we shouldn&#039;t sell all the coins at once, but just half of them for the amount required to buy the land.

But It is more efficient to create goods and services that other people in the surroundings don&#039;t have.

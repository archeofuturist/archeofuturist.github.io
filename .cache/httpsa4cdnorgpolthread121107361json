Through this automatic categorization, there is an immediate identification of an out group and an in group for the individual and, as a result, the relations between individuals of different groups are affected WHETHER WE WANT IT OR NOT.<br><br>(2) This group identification is very tightly correlated with different histories, and different position relative to historical events. As a result, the institutions and the culture that are part of this historical process will not have the same valence for a person of one race versus that of an other. A black person feels quite differently about the founding fathers than does a white person.<br><br>(3) Race is also coupled with culture through the mechanism of cultural vertical transmission. Vertically transmitted traits are those which are passed on from parent to child. Religion and language are usually transmitted in such a manner. What this mean is that different racial groups having developed different culture will conserve these traits across generations.<br><br>(4) The possibility of emergent properties of race dynamic must also be taken into account. The phenomena of self segregation, which is racial segregation happening without anyone explicitly wishing for it is one example.<br><br>(5) The fact of homophily -- the tendency of people to hang out with people that are &quot;like them&quot; (along some dimension) -- also means that racial similarity foster the creation of racially homogeneous group, and with it distinct identities and sub culture and the creation of out and in group.<br><br>There&#039;s other stuff.

His trial judge was having an affair with the prosecutor; the two would later get married. The same judge later expressed his regret at appointing a lawyer to Lee\u2019s state habeas proceeding who showed up to court obviously intoxicated. A state prosecutor raised concerns that the attorney was slurring his words, stumbling in the courtroom, and speaking incoherently, while \u201cintroducing the same items of evidence over and over again.\u201d Later, the judge told the lawyer that he was unaware he had only recently been in rehab. \u201cIf I had known that, I would not have put you on this case,\u201d he said.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Yet despite ample blood and fingerprints at the scene, virtually no physical evidence was found to match Lee. The case against him relied on eyewitness testimony \u2014 now known to be notoriously unreliable \u2014 along with two main pieces of forensic evidence. One was an apparent blood spot found on a pair of Converse sneakers Lee was wearing at the time of his arrest. According to the Arkansas Supreme Court, a state serologist \u201cconfirmed the presence of blood, but consumed the entire sample, thus removing the opportunity for independent analysis by the defense.\u201d The second piece of evidence was a hair sample thought to come from a black man \u201cand found to be \u2018consistent\u2019 with Lee\u2019s based on microscopic examination \u2014 a forensic method that has since been discredited,\u201d according to the Innocence Project.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The number of death row exonerees climbed to 158 this week<\/span><br><br><a href=\"#p122101887\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122101887<\/a><br><a href=\"#p122102125\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122102125<\/a><br><br>Not very bright, are you?","time":1492753899,"resto":122101543,"id":"3ZPCNo\/Z","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122103603,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)01:52:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122102072\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122102072<\/a>","filename":"1454905103775890","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":480,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1492753935163,"time":1492753935,"md5":"Gq2lcYf\/4mBvlFVkezAKaw==","fsize":48356,"resto":122101543,"id":"Zx2EK4uQ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122103847,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)01:55:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122102072\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122102072<\/a><br>2pbp","time":1492754104,"resto":122101543,"id":"QNuaPmW7","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122104280,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)01:59:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122103550\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122103550<\/a><br>Best case scenario is he did it and the right man was killed. <br><br>Worst case scenario is a dead nigger.<br><br>As you can see, there&#039;s no downside.","time":1492754375,"resto":122101543,"id":"WR50vdRU","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122104424,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)02:01:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122101543\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122101543<\/a><br>HAHAHA LOOKS LIKE HE GOT BTFO&#039;D<br><br>kek wills it","time":1492754478,"resto":122101543,"id":"gPwnit39","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122104701,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)02:04:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122102125\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122102125<\/a><br><br>And he gets the least painful way to die that the state could come up with<br><br>Considering odds are we will die in some car crash or by so men painful condition I&#039;d say that nigger got off easy as fuck","time":1492754690,"resto":122101543,"id":"VoyFO7+v","country":"MX","country_name":"Mexico"},{"no":122104801,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)02:05:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122103550\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122103550<\/a><br><br>libtards always do this. every fucking time, without fail there they are, calling into question everything even if they have to make up stories.<br><br>what they don&#039;t tell you is that a jury of the accused&#039;s peers did not have ANY doubt as to his guilt. otherwise there would have been a hung jury or an acquittal.<br><br>i will never understand the libtard mind that is unironically pro-abortion as a Right and yet vehemently opposed to the death penalty for the most violent, crazy criminals.","filename":"disgusting","ext":".png","w":299,"h":400,"tn_w":93,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492754750343,"time":1492754750,"md5":"cZPlg9aQxUBsRN2ONBWBFw==","fsize":144666,"resto":122101543,"id":"YSnmm1ch","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122104848,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)02:06:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122103550\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122103550<\/a><br>As well:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The ruling put all executions on hold. Shortly afterward, a second ruling, by the Arkansas Supreme Court, granted a stay to Johnson, with lawyers for the Innocence Project successfully arguing that Johnson has the right to an evidentiary hearing in order to make the case for DNA testing.

He, too, has fought for DNA testing, to no avail.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Lawyers this week sought a stay of execution from the Arkansas Supreme Court, arguing that the Converse sneakers and hair fibers should be subject to DNA testing, which has advanced by leaps and bounds since the 1990s. But their argument was rejected.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;But putting aside the DNA evidence, perhaps the biggest red flag in the case was the state\u2019s reliance on Heath\u2019s traumatized young daughter, Ashley. Though she was found incompetent to testify at Johnson\u2019s first trial, in 1994, Ashley was deemed ready to take the stand for the retrial in 1997.

Ironically, as we noted this morning, Pompeo&#039;s comments can just days before the FBI and CIA admitted that they are searching for an &quot;insider&quot; at the CIA (not a Russian) who exposed thousands of top-secret documents that described CIA tools used to penetrate smartphones, smart televisions and computer systems<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Of course, it&#039;s unclear what immediate purpose the charges will serve given that Assange is holed up in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London for the sole purpose of avoiding political persecution. That said, somehow we suspect that some form of &#039;leverage&#039; is about to be applied against Ecuador to help them &#039;remember&#039; that they have other immediate and critically important uses for Assange&#039;s London bedroom.<\/span>","filename":"Julian_Assange_August_2014","ext":".jpg","w":893,"h":1253,"tn_w":178,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492783390480,"time":1492783390,"md5":"gRDH68w89fJI42jRmz3pyw==","fsize":678234,"resto":0,"id":"MRMpXXx+","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"trump-to-issue-arrest-warrant-and-charges-for","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":122138687,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)10:05:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;CNN<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;anonymous sources <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; it&#039;s unclear<\/span><br><br>fuck off","time":1492783503,"resto":122138535,"id":"7E7LBntQ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

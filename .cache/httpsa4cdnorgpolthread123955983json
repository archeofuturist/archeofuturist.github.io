Despite being a Washington elite, he still makes time for charity. He coaches leaders at Nuestros Peque\u00f1os Hermanos, homes for orphaned and abandoned children, an orphanage in Mexico, Honduras, Haiti, Nicaragua, Guatemala, ElSalvador, the Dominican Republic, Bolivia and Peru. His son, Max Maccoby, is on the Boards of Directors at an NPH orphanage called Friends of the Orphans. Laura Silsby, while working with Friends of the Orphans, was arrested for attempted trafficking of 33 Haitian children. She was released upon HRC&#039;s intervention. Now back to Max Maccoby. Turns out he lawyered the case on behalf of one James Alefantis against former lover David Brock.","filename":"maccobby","ext":".jpg","w":457,"h":640,"tn_w":178,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493842322442,"time":1493842322,"md5":"w4BObVO\/vHFvu24AZ8kBhw==","fsize":92294,"resto":0,"id":"tvaH23lX","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"ewo","country_name":"United States","replies":14,"images":0,"unique_ips":8},{"no":123956634,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)16:15:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"bump","time":1493842538,"resto":123955983,"id":"E\/kU73B1","country":"BE","country_name":"Belgium"},{"no":123956731,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)16:16:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123955983\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123955983<\/a><br>Any link for the Elefantis connection?","time":1493842575,"resto":123955983,"id":"D75ziABx","country":"CL","country_name":"Chile"},{"no":123956746,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)16:16:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"Don&#039;t let this slide","time":1493842581,"resto":123955983,"id":"TdJRTcnb","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123956951,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)16:17:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/123951736#p123951736\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123951736<\/a><br><br>check dis too","time":1493842666,"resto":123955983,"id":"FlzTP2yc","country":"TR","country_name":"Turkey"},{"no":123957087,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)16:18:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"https:\/\/www.docdroid.net\/lIpLMAN\/br<wbr>ock-court-documents-.pdf.html#page=<wbr>9<br><br>page 9","time":1493842722,"resto":123955983,"id":"tvaH23lX","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123957185,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)16:19:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123956731\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123956731<\/a><br>link above was for (you)","time":1493842763,"resto":123955983,"id":"tvaH23lX","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123957419,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)16:20:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"Bump for justice","time":1493842857,"resto":123955983,"id":"TdJRTcnb","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123958227,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)16:26:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123955983\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123955983<\/a><br>Not to discount any of this but I think we&#039;ve known all this since the original EWO threads, no?","time":1493843195,"resto":123955983,"id":"Im0BEdMd","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123958263,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)16:26:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"Have another","time":1493843208,"resto":123955983,"id":"TdJRTcnb","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123958304,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)16:27:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"bump for thruth","time":1493843223,"resto":123955983,"id":"JdywyFTi","country":"RO","country_name":"Romania"},{"no":123958459,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)16:28:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"Is it possible to attach napalm to a toy drone?","time":1493843291,"resto":123955983,"id":"E\/kU73B1","country":"BE","country_name":"Belgium"},{"no":123958558,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)16:28:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123955983\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123955983<\/a><br>Just another piece of shit that will swing come TDOR","time":1493843334,"resto":123955983,"id":"Kam3oiuD","country":"PA","country_name":"Panama"},{"no":123958576,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)16:29:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123958227\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123958227<\/a><br>Its been known for a few months now.

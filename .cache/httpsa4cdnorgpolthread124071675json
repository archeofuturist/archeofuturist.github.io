While modern Aircrafts use explosion, meaning a product gets burned to achieve the desired flightspeed and height and thus turns the fuel to waste (soot), implosion technique takes a &quot;low quality&quot; product (as in: not processed) and produces energy without waste, whilst refining the used product in the process. The same way as plants grow. This means that you don&#039;t actually need fossil energy and the exploiton of earths ressources since theres enough Air and water on the planet. But guess who doesn&#039;t want you to produce free energy?","filename":"hqdefault","ext":".jpg","w":480,"h":360,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1493912308191,"time":1493912308,"md5":"2aTvQz6lduAD0ll+QHmUPQ==","fsize":39430,"resto":0,"id":"oLiDf5bc","country":"DE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"nazi-influence-after-ww2-their-holdout-in","country_name":"Germany","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

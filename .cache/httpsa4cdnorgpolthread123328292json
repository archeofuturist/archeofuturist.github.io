In the long run, too much authoritarianism will lead to rebellion for freedom, whereas too much freedom will lead to rebellion for a more authoritarian society.<br><br>Globalisation is irreversible. You have to deal with it, whether you&#039;re more on the tribalist or globalist side. Acknowledge that there are differences between races, but don&#039;t let that bias you from the get go against any single individual of any skin color or religious background. At the same time, however, don&#039;t let that fact stop you from moving to a whiter, richer, less problematic street\/city\/country. Be a hypocrite and learn that hypocrisy is the single most defining human trait. Group dynamics are different from individual dynamics.<br><br>Acknowledge inequality and the benefits that come with it. High standards of living are possible because of socioeconomic stratification. The exception would seem to be rich &quot;socialist&quot; countries, like Norway, but those are only viable because of the existance of a global superpower (USA), from which most technological innovation and economic progress stems. They ride on the backs of the most economically free societies and their achievements. The key is the degree of socioeconomic stratification that a society as a whole will deem acceptable. In other words, to maintain the sustainibility of a developed society, some concessions to the lower classes have to and will always be made (i.e., mo money fo dem programs). Compromise is both good and inevitable.<br><br>But you&#039;ll come to those realizations eventually, once you experience a little bit of each side of the spectrum, as with all things, and grow out of your meme phase.","filename":"centrist trump","ext":".jpg","w":652,"h":490,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1493468878502,"time":1493468878,"md5":"\/eTC342BcMlVA+YVaaNu\/A==","fsize":129346,"resto":0,"id":"0Y8QQ3Ax","country":"PT","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"reminder","country_name":"Portugal","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

Prevezon, is on the brink of going to trial in Manhattan \u2014 right in the middle of a massive shakeup of federal prosecutors by President Trump.<br><br>In court filings, the Department of Justice alleges that Prevezon, a Cyprus-based real estate company owned by a Russian national, purchased several New York City apartments with funds linked to a decade-old $230 million tax fraud case \u2014 the biggest in Russian history \u2014 perpetrated by gangsters and corrupt officials. In court filings, Prevezon says the DOJ has no hard evidence to back up its claims.<br><br>Last week, after plenty of drama, Trump fired Preet Bharara, the high-profile US attorney who was handling the case.

Senate Judiciary Chair JOE BIDEN blocked hearings from occurring for John Roberts (the current Chief Justice) at all. The Democrats filled the seat a year later under Clinton, stealing it from the Republicans.<br><br>When Francis Murnaghan of the 4th Circuit Court died in August of 2000, the Democrats kept the seat vacant for EIGHT YEARS. One of the nominees Bush put forward was Rod Rosenstein, who the Judiciary Committee just approved as Trump&#039;s Deputy Attorney General in a 19-1 vote (showing he has broad Democratic support). Nevertheless, they blocked him until the seat could be filled by a Democrat. The seat was stolen from Republicans in 2009.<br><br>Spread this reminder that the Democrats are, and always have been hypocrites. Don&#039;t let them claim the action to block Garland (which is the only basis for Gorsuch&#039;s supposed &quot;illegitimately&quot; they have advanced) is unprecedented.","filename":"gorsuch","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":400,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1491368783004,"time":1491368783,"md5":"CCOLDM\/bysYlDpHrpF4rCA==","fsize":21530,"resto":0,"id":"6eOdncCc","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"spread-these-facts-ahead-of-the-gorsuch-vote","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

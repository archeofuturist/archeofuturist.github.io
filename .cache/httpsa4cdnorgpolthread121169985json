Our ancient ancestors probably weren&#039;t jacking off to them. They had women as evidenced by the fact that they are our ancestors.<br> <br>Porn wasn&#039;t as big a problem for our fathers as it is for us. Porn in this accessible and private of a way has only been around for 2 or 3 decades. I think there&#039;s a similar thing going on as what happened when people didn&#039;t know how cancerous smoking cigarettes was, and sold them to minors, like my mother when she was only 12 years old. Now twelve year olds are watching giant dicks being shoved into gaping assholes as their earliest experiences of their sexuality. This isn&#039;t playboy or a video store. It&#039;s free, anonymous, and there&#039;s so much that you could never watch it all, playing on the male explorative\/variety\/novelty instinct and more obviously the sexual instincts in a negative way. Restricting access to porn based on age I think would be a good idea for the mental and sexual health of our future population. Maybe porn sites should require ID to access, like every other age-restricted product.<br> <br>I&#039;m 23 and I have ED. I also have a terrible porn habit. Maybe they&#039;re not connected, but it gets better when I don&#039;t fap, so I think it&#039;s probably related. Nofap is the same treatment of &quot;don&#039;t do that addictive thing&quot; that is used to treat every other addiction. If it doesn&#039;t work for any addiction, it&#039;s more a testament to what a huge problem addiction is for an individual than anything. I don&#039;t know what else to do. Imprisonment of addicts might be a better solution, but that involves a moral choice liberals aren&#039;t prepared to touch.","time":1492231765,"resto":121169985,"id":"PhlH1evw","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121171542,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)00:49:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121169985\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121169985<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I&#039;ve come across people who seriously wanted pornography banned, which is impossible to enforce, let alone insane.<\/span><br>Lol what?

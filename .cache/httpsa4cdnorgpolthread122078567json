It happens rarely, but for the most part it&#039;s as if they are completely unaware of whats actually going on.<br><br>While I was watching they brought on some &quot;experts&quot; to discuss the election (I don&#039;t know why they&#039;re still talking about this..) and the experts attempt to explain why Trump won. They talk about a bunch of neocon\/neoliberal bullshit for awhile, and never once mention how completely screwed up and out of touch the left is. <br><br>I understand that the media has a left-leaning bias, but the neocons that come on seem just as out of touch. They never bring up ideas like &quot;Well the right believes Hillary was using black and female issues to gain votes, and doesn&#039;t actually care about them.&quot; or &quot;The right thinks the left has gone too far, and that affirmative action is illiberal and doesn&#039;t stand for equality.&quot;<br><br>I look over at my grandparents after watching for awhile and say to them &quot;It&#039;s as if these people have no idea what&#039;s actually going on. They have no idea why the democrats are in the position they&#039;re in, and I don&#039;t even think they&#039;ll get it after they lose a second or third time.&quot;<br><br>I just don&#039;t understand it \/pol\/ why does normie media not even represent these ideas. They&#039;re left-wing bias, sure, but even the neocons have no idea. Don&#039;t give me &quot;muh they&#039;re all jews&quot;. Because if that&#039;s true they&#039;re completely retarded. Any normie that wants to know what&#039;s going on has the internet, and they&#039;ll get completely redpilled once they see how much the media omits, and misrepresents these ideas. I&#039;m starting to believe they&#039;re just literally that out of touch with reality, or maybe they&#039;re just blinded by the shekel and can&#039;t see how stupid they are.. I don&#039;t know. <br><br>tl:dr. Why is the media so out of touch with what&#039;s actually going on? Rarely mentions the culture war, or the ideas within it.

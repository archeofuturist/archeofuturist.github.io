I am betting that like all the rest of them you were saying Trump was stupid, he could never win, blah blah blah on and on through a year and a half straight of you making predictions and you being wrong about those predictions.<br><br>Somehow I am guessing that someone who thinks Trump is stupid did not predict he would ever win the election.<br><br>So my question is: why are you so intelligent again? You&#039;ve already said in the thread that you&#039;re not exactly a high earner. And it&#039;s pretty well known that it&#039;s very difficult for dumb people to even understand people who are significantly smarter than they are.<br><br>So is the issue that Trump is a moron? Or that he is of significantly above average intelligence, and that you are of middling intelligence and incapable of understanding the decisions he made during the campaign, why he did them, and why they&#039;re smart.<br><br>I would suggest looking back and asking yourself how correct you were in your predictions over the last few years. Of course you won&#039;t do it. There&#039;s a reason Trump gets so much support here. Some of us are pretty smart people, and a lot of us who watch him closely think he&#039;s pretty smart, too. <br><br>But again, if you keep making predictions and you&#039;re wrong, over and over, how many times do you have to be wrong before you question the assumptions that are causing you to make those wrong predictions?","time":1490479156,"resto":118269803,"id":"hbMEv59D","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118278244,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)18:00:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118277818\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118277818<\/a><br><br>No. It&#039;s a failure because it was poorly thought out and was destined to failure even before Trump won the election.<br><br>I hope a cop shoots you, nigger.","time":1490479216,"resto":118269803,"id":"XXT07gqu","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118278272,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)18:00:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118269803\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118269803<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;make a new bill to fix obamacare<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;dems and cuckservatives vote no<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;ok, then watch obamacare collapse&quot;<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;HURR THAT&#039;S CRUEL WORST PRESIDENT EVER<\/span>","time":1490479236,"resto":118269803,"id":"9pSCQ9Uv","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":118278461,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)18:02:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118274805\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118274805<\/a><br>Are people not allowed to question why someone has to take another shit on your rug to clean the shit that&#039;s already on the rug in the first place?

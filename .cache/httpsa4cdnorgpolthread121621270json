I can&#039;t imagine a world where these things dont happen<br><br>Speaking for myself, im not a big drug-guy (just thought this thread might be interesting), but I think roughly 80% of all the people I know under 50 have done drugs to various extents. Mostly just weed. I personally know numerous recently graduated medical doctors, lawyers, engineers, and high-functioning blue-collar workers who have done or continue to do drugs without failing to function. I also know some people who have &quot;fallen&quot; to addiction, and are now completely useless fuckups who feel shitty if i dont go a day without getting high. <br><br>My point with this is that, for the people who do it without complications, having it be illegal seriously infringes upon their individual rights. Why should they fear legal punishment for wanting something that (to milder or heavier extents) equates to having a beer? And why should they be forced to seek out active criminals (&quot;the bad men&quot;) in order to obtain this? And for people i know who are full-on addicts, why should they fear legal repercussion in order to seek help? If they didnt need to hide, it would be easier for people humanitarian organizations to find them. And by regulating it, and selling it legally, there would be no more &quot;borrowing&quot; from drug dealers (the criminal market, i believe, would pretty much vanish if it had to compete with a legal one. just look at alcohol), which leads to being visited by pushers, and soforth. and there no longer be these communities, which you describe, where drug-dealers are on every corner, essentially pushing it on people from a young age<br><br>with a legal market for narcotics, i dont imagine ads on TV for heroin, i imagine a highly regulated market something equivalent to drug-stores, which essentially makes it HARDER to obtain, but removes the criminal aspect","time":1492484271,"resto":121621270,"id":"R8rWwin7","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":121627396,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)22:57:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121626799\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121626799<\/a><br>why not?it keeps junkies away from society and if they WANT to live they can,if they WANT to kill themselves with dope they can do that too.in private away from the rest of society.","time":1492484275,"resto":121621270,"id":"nXK4RZj+","country":"MX","country_name":"Mexico"},{"no":121627400,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)22:57:57","name":"Anonymous","filename":"asdfasdfdff","ext":".png","w":470,"h":340,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":90,"tim":1492484277268,"time":1492484277,"md5":"CoW2I3EvpVu\/7ihMvtA3KQ==","fsize":389142,"resto":121621270,"id":"M9yd8mFP","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121627479,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)22:58:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121621270\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121621270<\/a><br><br>prime lohan hnnnnng<br>this nofap is killin me","time":1492484324,"resto":121621270,"id":"lWXNkp3V","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121627484,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)22:58:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121621270\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121621270<\/a><br>Man Lindsey Lohan was a fucking hot piece of ass boy.

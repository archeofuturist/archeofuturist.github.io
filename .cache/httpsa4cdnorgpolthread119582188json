Several thousands in Cacak, Subotica, Bor and Zajecar. Several hundreds also in Kraljevo, and other smaller cities.<br><br>Mixed crowd is attending the protests, apolitical people, liberals and right-wings are all in the streets. Protests are currently supported by Ljubisa Preletacevic Beli (Sarmu Probo Nisi), Sasa Jankovic (former ombudsman) and Bosko Obradovic (Dveri). Informal support was also given by Djordje Vukadinovic and NSPM, also by journalist Tesa Tesanovic who was leading the charge.<br><br>Government controlled media is trying to demonize protesters, but they can&#039;t stop us now.

They are protesting democracy. Vucic is aids, but not the type of aids we got unwillingly. Vucic is the type of aids you syringe out of a dead hookers body and then poke that needle right up in you. <br>We are a nation of degenerates, we deserved &#039;99, we deserved 2006, we deserved 2008 and we deserve what ever year Vojvodina decides to partition too.<br>Germany was carped bombed and they still managed to recover and have a decent living standard within 15 years. Its been almost 20 since we were last at war and the average salary is 300$ a month, stop blaming others for our problems and ask your self if we are the problem.","filename":"eJwVzMENwyAMAMBdGACnNqY42yCCCFUoCNxX1N2r3gB3m8-8zG5O1bF2gKOu1Odhl_YZS7al93LlOOqyqTeIqjGdLb91AT6RODgM5Mh7590GKCyIsgWhBzMTCtT2b16jmO8PwHsh2A.N-nW9X6JbXaljEPZ2GgWA-bT7mo","ext":".jpg","w":471,"h":245,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":65,"tim":1491382798033,"time":1491382798,"md5":"5A5uPEurHKy3mGCJ15Q9bA==","fsize":45422,"resto":119582188,"id":"7gRJIBOn","country":"RS","country_name":"Serbia"}]}

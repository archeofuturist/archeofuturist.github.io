Several thousands in Cacak, Subotica, Bor and Zajecar. Several hundreds also in Kraljevo, and other smaller cities.<br><br>Mixed crowd is attending the protests, apolitical people, liberals and right-wings are all in the streets. Protests are currently supported by Ljubisa Preletacevic Beli (Sarmu Probo Nisi), Sasa Jankovic (former ombudsman) and Bosko Obradovic (Dveri). Informal support was also given by Djordje Vukadinovic and NSPM, also by journalist Tesa Tesanovic who was leading the charge.<br><br>Government controlled media is trying to demonize protesters, but they can&#039;t stop us now.

Srbi su degenerici najveceg nivoa. Ljudi koji glasaju za kancer za sendvic i 10 evra. Ljudi koji iskreno veruju da su zapadnjaci superljudi zato sto imaju plate vece od 300$ mesecno. Ljudi koji pljuju ameriku zato sto je jedan u 10 hiljada amera peder ili trandza, a u isto vreme gotive rusiju u kojoj je svaki treci covek alkoholicar ili zavisnik od heroina. <br>Ne verujem u holokaust i ostale genocide drugog svetskog rata, jer nema dokaza. Ali ako je kojim slucajem bilo tacno da je Hitler hteo da nas istrebi, onda je imao dobru ideju.","time":1491385108,"resto":119582188,"id":"7gRJIBOn","country":"RS","country_name":"Serbia"},{"no":119589464,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)05:40:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119589086\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119589086<\/a><br>Beli nije fenomen uopste, tj ne u tom smislu na koji ti mislis makar.

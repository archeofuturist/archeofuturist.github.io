It operates in patterns and anything your brain can do to make its job easier, it will. Depression is what occurs when chemical imbalances in the brain lead to patterns that make naturally experiencing joy, comfort, and relief extremely difficult to virtually impossible, resulting in a seemingly constant hollowness or sadness. Note that sadness is not a synonym of depression, but a symptom of depression. Depression is something physically present in your brain and requires treatment. You can treat this with meds, or you can treat it by taking very deliberate measures to reprogram the brain manually. The latter is very fucking hard to do, even as an expert, and isn&#039;t practical for most people, because most people can hardly tie their own damn shoes properly.<br><br>If you want to fix your depression and don&#039;t have the money for meds (or are just scared of taking them), there are still countless little things you can do to put up a fight, and possibly even get a handle on it or reverse the depression altogether. The little things might not feel like they matter by themselves, but if you could change the big things in your life, you wouldn&#039;t be desperate for change, anyway. So fucking do them.<br><br>When you get up in the morning, open the windows and let the sunlight in. Make a list of daily tasks to accomplish- call John Doe about Thing X, go pay the water bill, get groceries, etc. Then do those things. When you&#039;re in public, be friendly with cashiers, wave at people, start conversations, etc. Eat when you&#039;re hungry, and try to snack less. Make yourself do these things, even when you don&#039;t want to or don&#039;t feel like it&#039;s helping. Don&#039;t sit on your ass playing video games all day and wonder why your brain isn&#039;t repairing itself. Happiness may not necessarily be a thing you pursue so much as a thing you simply are, but you won&#039;t be capable of feeling happy until your brain learns\/relearns how to be open to the possibility of it. So open that fucker up.","filename":"1463083368659","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":375,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1490230954439,"time":1490230954,"md5":"+sMzRM4nNW+0bNFrlPhf2g==","fsize":116660,"resto":117851718,"id":"vWPjgtrx","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117861282,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)21:04:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117851718\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117851718<\/a><br>Why be depressed when you can funnel that into anger and aggression and go after feds and deep state cucks?","filename":"aaroncooper","ext":".jpg","w":592,"h":682,"tn_w":108,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490231046852,"time":1490231046,"md5":"Bovp7ulPsNERF\/pnwHnSHQ==","fsize":45520,"resto":117851718,"id":"pf58iJD+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117862441,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)21:11:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117851718\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117851718<\/a><br>I had severe bouts of depression and anxiety for over a decade until I changed my diet","time":1490231516,"resto":117851718,"id":"7VojzsCv","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":117862449,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)21:11:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117851718\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117851718<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;how does one overcome the feeling that they have depression?<\/span><br>Easy peasy friendo. Just get addicted to the internet and use \/pol\/ until you get inadvertently indoctrinated into a hivemind cult that gives you a cloudy sense of meaning and direction and community as well as the ego boost of seeing yourself as being superior and having secret knowledge over others.

I basically escaped to a border town expecting to cross the frontier and then not knowing what can I do.

I will brief you on how to get asylum. I live on the border where refugees cross. Take a plane to New York and then a Greyhound bus to Plattsburgh. From there, take a taxi to Roxham Road in Champlain. They&#039;ll take you right to the border and you can cross by the ditch. The RCMP will pick you up on the Canadian side and you can claim asylum.","time":1492297963,"resto":121272163,"id":"jHGT1D6X","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121277610,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)19:12:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"just say you&#039;re a muslim then they&#039;ll ship you to europe.","time":1492297967,"resto":121272163,"id":"IcZ4a95o","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121277690,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)19:13:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121277393\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121277393<\/a><br>NOPE .","time":1492297993,"resto":121272163,"id":"IcZ4a95o","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121277704,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)19:13:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121277548\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121277548<\/a><br>Sorry not everyone is a white supremacist piece of shit like you.","time":1492297998,"resto":121272163,"id":"AZC3yvbV","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121277712,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)19:13:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121274280\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121274280<\/a><br>what are you waiting for? kys.","time":1492298003,"resto":121272163,"id":"MjvoZ7Ac","country":"EC","country_name":"Ecuador"},{"no":121277795,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)19:13:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121277704\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121277704<\/a><br>A FUCKING LEAF","time":1492298030,"resto":121272163,"id":"0xXaC97Z","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121277854,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)19:14:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121275951\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121275951<\/a><br>heh. you want in to canada, huh? <br><br>after what you said?","time":1492298051,"resto":121272163,"id":"NcOiMwq1","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121277902,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)19:14:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121277795\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121277795<\/a>","filename":"AHAHAAAAAAAA","ext":".png","w":800,"h":800,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492298073264,"time":1492298073,"md5":"YJkzqaW27gIzY0g4l9Q1TA==","fsize":1423640,"resto":121272163,"id":"lYfcf6Hy","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":121278020,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)19:15:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121276773\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121276773<\/a><br>Thank Manolito.

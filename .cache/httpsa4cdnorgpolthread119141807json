That itself was a violation of the Logan Act, and then Flynn went on to lie about it to the FBI, a prosecutable felony. MSNBC analyst Jeremy Bash, who has a prior history as Chief of Staff at the State Department and CIA, reported the following on-air on Thursday night. His words were posted online by respected political pundit Caroline Orr:<br><br>This may explain why Michael Flynn is offering to cut a deal. He\u2019s spent years working in the government, including the Defense Intelligence Agency, and he\u2019s surely aware that immunity is only granted when a suspect can deliver evidence that a more important suspect in the hierarchy is guilty. Flynn wouldn\u2019t even be bothering to make the immunity request unless he has sufficient evidence up his sleeve.","filename":"1305477152315","ext":".jpg","w":5616,"h":3744,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1491019572550,"time":1491019572,"md5":"ZttkfYITGQiu9g8JxtHJhQ==","fsize":1123988,"resto":0,"id":"R+41wl9h","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"mike-flynn-was-forced-to-resign-in-february-after","country_name":"United States","replies":7,"images":1,"unique_ips":7},{"no":119141932,"now":"04\/01\/17(Sat)00:07:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"Jeremy Bash on @MSNBC: Flynn may have evidence showing he was given orders from Trump to discuss removing sanctions w\/Russian ambassador.","time":1491019641,"resto":119141807,"id":"R+41wl9h","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119142039,"now":"04\/01\/17(Sat)00:08:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119141932\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119141932<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;may have<\/span>","filename":"image","ext":".png","w":491,"h":543,"tn_w":113,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491019712725,"time":1491019712,"md5":"AV1Br3aHAlSde\/giOqcNKg==","fsize":438620,"resto":119141807,"id":"BsWIdFDZ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119142080,"now":"04\/01\/17(Sat)00:08:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119141807\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119141807<\/a><br>Then why are the House and Senate Committees refusing to grant him immunity?<br>If they really thought he had the dirt on Trump, they&#039;d be all over that, wouldn&#039;t they?","time":1491019735,"resto":119141807,"id":"nL29xIDQ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119142253,"now":"04\/01\/17(Sat)00:10:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"muh dick","time":1491019850,"resto":119141807,"id":"nbP8zfbu","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119142450,"now":"04\/01\/17(Sat)00:12:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;illegally discussing sanctions<\/span><br>He didn&#039;t break any laws talking to anyone.

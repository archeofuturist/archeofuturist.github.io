Doing biology. By the third year we should pick either botany, zoology or microbiology and specialize there. Which one is better? Kinda leaning towards microbiology, since it makes all the buzz these days and it shouldnt be too hard to find a job. But even though it might pay well, I&#039;ll just sit in a lab all day long, which is not much fun. B and Z, however, though not being as desirable or well paid for, promise lots of field work, expeditions, which is fun. Should I go for money or for fun? Still got 2 years to think about it, just want to hear some opinions.","time":1491186964,"resto":119274799,"id":"e3n3ycgP","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":119279964,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)22:36:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"what about biology?","time":1491186987,"resto":119274799,"id":"GOxnojmA","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119280104,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)22:38:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119279535\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119279535<\/a><br>I was planning on going to Hofstra University in Long Island since it was close to home.

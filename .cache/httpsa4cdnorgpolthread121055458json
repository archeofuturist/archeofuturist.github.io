All meta studies on antidepressants show that they do significantly work better than placebos on those with moderate to sever cases of major depressive disorder. But when the depression is mild then they do not differ from placebos.<br><br>The reason is that antidepressant, mainly I&#039;m discussing the mechanisms of SSRIs, do not &quot;correct brain chemistry&quot; by &quot;increasing the amount of serotonin because depressed people have low levels of them.&quot; This is a very old debunked hypothesis. First off, no study has ever shown depressed people have low levels of serotonin hell some have found high levels. Second, if this was how it worked then the pill should produce an effect almost immediately not take weeks like it does.<br><br>No the real mechanism is still being hypothesis but the one most currently supported is that antidepressents like a SSRI increases the production of neuropeptides which then reverses the atrophying of the hippocampus which is seen in people with moderate to sever cases of depression. What I mean by this is people with sever cases of depression have a noticeably smaller and less active hippocampus which is involved with both memories and learning. After a few weeks, the increased levels of neuropeptides reverse this and the hippocampus becomes more active and larger again. Keep in mind the hippocampus is one of the few places that produces new brain cells.<br><br>This is why antidepressants only work on cases of sever major depression and why it takes weeks to produce an effect. My point being that they are an absolute necessity for these people but many of those diagnosed with depression is due to some other minor environmental or social factor which will not be caused due to an atrophying brain so antidepressants will not work on them. They instead need to either fix whatever environmental or social factor is causing the change in mood or learn coping strategies.","filename":"hanipsych-biology-of-depression-29-638","ext":".jpg","w":638,"h":479,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1492185685451,"time":1492185685,"md5":"bBG116e9KgyP68lP0PfJ\/w==","fsize":76204,"resto":121055458,"id":"hFiNE+fh","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121076626,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)12:01:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121075805\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121075805<\/a><br>That&#039;s the thing, I&#039;ve been using them in the intended manor.

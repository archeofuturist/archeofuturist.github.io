Chances are, if you have it, people will want more of it than you are likely to want to give away in exchange for things you can actually use or eat. Gold is... okay.<br><br>The real post-apocalyptic currency of note? BULLETS! Of course, bullets. They have everything: <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;cheaper to stock up on right now than gold<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;actually useful in and of themselves<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;will only increase in scarcity and value in a SHTF scenario<\/span><br><br>So, what kinds of bullets should you get? The smart money is on .22... as a small game round, it will likely be used up faster than many other calibers. Get as many variants as possible; nothing wrong with a little variety, and it&#039;s not like you are going to be shooting them out of your own guns. There&#039;s a good chance the people you buy things from with them will also continue to just keep them in circulation.<br><br>Buy as many different kinds of bullets as you can and a gun safe. A gun safe filled completely with bullets will make you a well-off entity once the Reckoning comes. It&#039;s the only right choice.","filename":"MONEY","ext":".jpg","w":1600,"h":1066,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1493782099913,"time":1493782099,"md5":"ZbGvEr4dRL3eof4KvmiE9Q==","fsize":376620,"resto":0,"id":"3sVDlb1i","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"somebody-just-posted-a-gold-standard-thread-which","country_name":"United States","replies":10,"images":0,"unique_ips":6},{"no":123865181,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)23:31:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123864874\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123864874<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;being on the gold standard means we actually have gold in our pockets<\/span><br><br>No","time":1493782261,"resto":123864874,"id":"KC9NrgOq","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123865456,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)23:33:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123865181\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123865181<\/a><br>Paper money based on gold would be even worse in an apocalypse than having gold. <br><a href=\"#p123864874\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123864874<\/a><br>Toilet paper is the money of the future","time":1493782418,"resto":123864874,"id":"LP3PZA66","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123865469,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)23:33:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123864874\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123864874<\/a><br>any type of common round will be valuable. you&#039;re right, gold will be a meme because of its awkward scale of value, a cheaper metal like silver that can be broken down into smaller denominations would be much more valuable if anything","time":1493782425,"resto":123864874,"id":"xa1fkNLw","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123865486,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)23:33:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123865181\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123865181<\/a><br><br>I don&#039;t care what kind of magic scrip you have clogging your wallet.

I can vouch for you guys on the outside of the gates that it truly is written by the Holy Spirit, by God within each person. And the baptism ensues for The Lord Lives Forever! Glory to the most high God! <br><br>Hey guys. I gotta break it to you for real though real talk. I figured out The Holy Bible Really Is True 100% so, sorry but I also repent for that because why would I be sorry for knowing God and Jesus Christ The Truth? Just keep watching I say to you unbelievers. Keep watching the world but also in all fairness give The Book Of Revelations a try and read the rest of the Bible!","filename":"image","ext":".jpg","w":480,"h":360,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1492854484915,"time":1492854484,"md5":"gIKceYMzoghbLa9k3NRWlA==","fsize":48270,"resto":0,"id":"PrdYL\/2I","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"so-a-small-amount-of-you-think-the-bible-is-a","country_name":"Canada","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

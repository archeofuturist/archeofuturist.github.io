We&#039;ve read books &quot;us and them: the dangerous politics of immigration control&quot; and &quot;border walls: security and the war on terror in the United States&quot; and a slew of articles, all pro immigration.<br><br>When I asked him if we could read more articles anti immigration to &quot;understand the opposing side&quot; he said that there just aren&#039;t any unbiased scholarly books or articles that are coherent.<br><br>I did get him to pull up one thing, he picked huntingtons &quot;who are we?&quot; And the class dismissed his arguments as nationalist and racist.<br><br>Is there any articles or books I can bring up that argue against immigration that don&#039;t come off as racism\/ statistical racism?<br><br>I went into the class because i have feelings for nationalism, but also compassion for migrants.

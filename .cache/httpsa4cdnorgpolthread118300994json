It can be used to detect aircraft, ships, spacecraft, guided missiles, motor vehicles, weather formations, and terrain. A radar system consists of a transmitter producing electromagnetic waves in the radio or microwaves domain, a transmitting antenna, a receiving antenna (often the same antenna is used for transmitting and receiving) and a receiver and processor to determine properties of the object(s). Radio waves (pulsed or continuous) from the transmitter reflect off the object and return to the receiver, giving information about the object&#039;s location and speed.<\/span><br><br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Radar<wbr>","time":1490492995,"resto":118300994,"id":"M7cmuHyP","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":118306538,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)22:12:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118300994\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118300994<\/a><br>This is the kind of worthless idea a 110 IQ leftist comes up with.

CHILDREN.","com":"Anyone else getting sick of our pathetic leaders using children as an excuse to go to war? What kind of fucking leader manipulates their population into investing so much money and soldiers&#039; lives with pictures of dead children. Of course people are going to go all in when they see that shit, you think anyone wants to speak up and say &quot;wait a minute, let&#039;s think this through,&quot; when everyone will shame them because they obviously don&#039;t care about the CHILDREN. <br><br>You know what I say? <br><br>FUCK the Syrian children. Fuck them. Fuck their parents. Fuck their country. <br><br>We wasted how many trillions of dollars &quot;fixing&quot; countries with brutal dictators who hurt the CHILDREN, and where has it got us? When has this kind of action yielded good results? Never. <br><br>Tell people like Marco Rubio, who I just saw a video of standing in front of a big screen with all these dead Syrian children, telling us it&#039;s our job to help all these poor, defenseless, dead babies or else we&#039;re fucked up people. <br><br>If wanting to keep my own men and women safe, use that money we use for huge wars instead for actual AMERICAN interests, and not manipulate people through cheap emotional images makes me an awful person, then good. I want to be awful. <br><br>There&#039;s nothing humanitarian about it, no matter how many times Trump, McCain, or Rubio say &quot;b-b-but muh dead babies!&quot;","filename":"&amp;NCS_modified=20160608145449&amp;MaxW=640&amp;imageVersion=default&amp;AR-160319469","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":427,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1491680495587,"time":1491680495,"md5":"zVRSKsgZcRYF4OrFv5SNLw==","fsize":100077,"resto":0,"id":"+r69m+oU","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"dead-little-children","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":120172867,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)15:43:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"You sound like someone who supported the death of half a million children in Iraq","time":1491680583,"resto":120172690,"id":"5Pu31V1H","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120173073,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)15:44:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120172867\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120172867<\/a><br>You see, there&#039;s a difference between &quot;supporting,&quot; and not dropping my entire life and putting my own children in danger just to feel good about myself. <br><br>It sucks it happens, but NOT MY PROBLEM.","time":1491680674,"resto":120172690,"id":"+r69m+oU","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

If they evolved into humans, the apes should naturally be gone . . . right?<br><br>Well, no, not really.<br><br>This argument shows a misunderstanding of what evolutionists actually believe about human evolution. The evolutionary concept of the origin of humans is not based on humans descending from modern apes but, rather, argues that humans and modern apes share a common ancestor.<br><br>According to the evolutionary worldview, several million years ago there existed a group of creatures that would ultimately give rise to both modern apes and modern humans. At some point, a small group of creatures became reproductively isolated from the main group. These two groups then followed different evolutionary pathways, resulting in the modern apes and modern humans. So, in reality, there is nothing about the existence of modern apes that would trouble an evolutionist. In fact, raising this issue only shows a lack of understanding on the part of those believing that the existence of modern apes is a stumbling block for evolution. This argument also seems to imply that creationists are deliberately committing a straw-man fallacy (misrepresentation of an opponent\u2019s position), but in reality, creationists who use this argument simply misunderstand what evolutionists believe.","filename":";-)","ext":".png","w":24,"h":28,"tn_w":24,"tn_h":28,"tim":1492626805354,"time":1492626805,"md5":"1UV0GozoqcuuQo0agLmeBA==","fsize":443,"resto":121875772,"id":"pdFpjRFo","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121876271,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)14:33:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"because we waz common ancestors to the same apes n shiet","time":1492626830,"resto":121875772,"id":"kCtjf1RL","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121876336,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)14:34:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"this hurt my brain, even the usual people who deny evolution understand the consept to some degree","time":1492626857,"resto":121875772,"id":"t2\/NndaO","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":121876370,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)14:34:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121875772\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121875772<\/a><br>Because you&#039;re retarded.

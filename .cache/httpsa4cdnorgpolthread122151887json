And Metal Storm, and their Railgun.<br><br>Which brings me to the other point: The less time you have to react be better. With the Rods from God and the Rail Gun, you can cut the reaction time due to sheer velocity of the projectile. The Rail Gun system shoots a sabot at mach-7 or so. Much faster than any other conventional weapon and is pure kinetic. Hard to detect and react.<br><br>But I see your point too. Cost vs Benefit. High tech isn&#039;t always better.

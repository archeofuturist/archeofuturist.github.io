Do some &quot;we wuz kangs&quot; research, what&#039;s happening right now has happened before. Egypt became a race mixing cesspit of corporate trivial novelties. Just the way they like it so they can stay in control. While (((they))) maintained their distinct differences involving culture, family, history, heritage, a sense of future, and direction. Blacks did ok for a little bit in the Egypt setting but slowly started to revert back to their chimp ways of blinging out when being around a critical mass of their own and not having enough influence from other racial groups.

The Asian giant shipped about 500,000 tons of crude to the North each year until 2013, according to the Chinese customs agency. Bilateral ties cooled that year after Pyongyang carried out its third nuclear test, and exports officially have remained at zero since 2014. But China is believed to still provide crude to North Korea off the books. A complete freeze would impact the North Korean economy.<\/span><br><br><br>http:\/\/asia.nikkei.com\/Spotlight\/Py<wbr>ongyang-provocation\/Beijing-may-cut<wbr>-crude-oil-to-Pyongyang-says-Chines<wbr>e-expert","filename":"0421N-China-North-Korea_article_main_image","ext":".jpg","w":580,"h":396,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":170,"tim":1492711314094,"time":1492711314,"md5":"8KYKlRaTHUGIFCEIyhphSQ==","fsize":57564,"resto":0,"id":"mXL16a7n","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"looks-like-shit-is-starting-to-get-real-with-nk","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":122021426,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)14:08:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"Milk them dry and then go for re-unification.<br>Let NK become a free trade zone like HK, just end this terrible regime.","time":1492711732,"resto":122020758,"id":"siadd73s","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"}]}

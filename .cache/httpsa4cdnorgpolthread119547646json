But, with this decision, federal law is catching up to public opinion: 90 percent of Americans already believe that LGBT employees should be valued for how well they do their jobs -- not who they love or who they are,&quot; said Greg Nevins of Lambda. &quot;This decision is game-changer for lesbian and gay employees facing discrimination in the workplace and sends a clear message to employers: It is against the law to discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation.&quot;<br><br>The trial court held that Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which prohibits employers from discriminating against workers on the basis of sex, race, color, national origin and religion, does not protect employees from anti-gay discrimination. Lambda appealed the ruling in 2015 and lost again before a three-judge panel last year. Lambda then requested a rehearing before the circuit&#039;s full, seven-judge panel.","filename":"gay4","ext":".jpg","w":599,"h":337,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1491356145814,"time":1491356145,"md5":"F9iGCJeeIQCIQTGVkX7phA==","fsize":75383,"resto":0,"id":"PxF5vL+6","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"federal-appeals-court-rules-existing-law-covers","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":119548605,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)21:44:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119547646\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119547646<\/a><br>bump","time":1491356668,"resto":119547646,"id":"2OrD4kpr","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119550507,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)21:58:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119547646\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119547646<\/a><br>This is good news.<br>There is literally nothing wrong with being gay.","time":1491357481,"resto":119547646,"id":"6eTvFx0P","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

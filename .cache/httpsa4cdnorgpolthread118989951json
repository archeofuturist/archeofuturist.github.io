I honestly think this alt-right label was just re-popularized by leftists and Hillary&#039;s campaign because calling people Nazis got old and they needed a hip new spooky slur for the right.

It always seems like he only speaks half of his ideas, never says how he wants to achieve them, or just makes vague attempts of explain how to accomplish goals. What I get from him is that he wants two main things: To get white people to become ethno-nationalists and to have America be (stay?) a white ethno-nationalist state. I don&#039;t care about the first thing but it&#039;s the second one that confuses me. How can you establish a country as a white ethno-state when large (and increasing) demographics in it aren&#039;t white without acting in an immoral way? It seems like he tries to be moral as he says slavery is wrong so i&#039;m sure he wouldn&#039;t want to genocide off all the nonwhites. He wants the people running the government to be white. Regardless of his reasoning, how would you achieve that in a nation with a ton of nonwhites without having laws, which would be racist, in place to achieve that?<br><br>I think he isn&#039;t much of a debater. He went on that show with some black nationalist guy and Spencer just seemed so bad at trying to beat the guy. There were so many points that he could have easily countered and brought up but he just kept to that vague idea spouting. I&#039;m not even a ethno-nationalist but I felt I could make the case for it better than he did in that instance.","time":1490920454,"resto":118989951,"id":"60kMqMo7","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

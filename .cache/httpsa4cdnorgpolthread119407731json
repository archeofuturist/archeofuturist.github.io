Muhammed Ali was a world-class athlete and at one point a very rich man, IQ 80&#039;s. Evolution shapes our natural properties and capabilities, like height. It is an inane, anti-scientific worldview to imply that the organ which contributes the most to our survival and reproduction (the brain) is not under strong selective pressure. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; If you grow up in an area with stability, two parents that make sure you do your homework and eat your veggies and provide you with basic necessities, you&#039;ll do fine.<\/span><br><br>This radical egalitarian position which insists that inheritance has a negligible role on intelligence is contrary to all the research on the subject. Look at twin studies (such as Minnesota), or aggregate statistics on performance by ethnicity. On average, black children adopted by well-off white families, who go to good schools, have lower IQ and lower performance\/outcome metrics than white children born in poverty. Most modern psychologists and psychometricians peg the inheritance coefficient of IQ (one very good determinant of overall capability and complex problem solving) at 0.6-0.8. No one knows how to increase IQ, either -- only how it is decreased: abuse and malnutrition. <br><br>Saying &quot;environment and individual ambition plays the largest role&quot; is strictly Flat Earth territory. Inherited traits have a normal (bell-curve) distribution. <br><br>Anousheh Ansari is Iranian, and ethnically Persian.

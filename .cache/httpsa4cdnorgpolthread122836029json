The school system should be able to provide a &quot;safe space&quot; for disadvantaged kids. I&#039;d much prefer the school system to be taking care of adoption services in that way, the teachers and faculty are always in contact with the kid and know whats going on and its easier to get in contact with the parents.","time":1493180562,"resto":122836029,"id":"YjP+5KAK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122842143,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)00:24:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122836029\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122836029<\/a><br>I want, I want, I want<br><br>Funny, I remember the saying: Ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your county... hmmmm,","time":1493180652,"resto":122836029,"id":"a3ndd5K0","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122842513,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)00:27:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122842143\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122842143<\/a><br>Kennedy would be outcasted before he could even be any type of political threat as a democrat with modern Libs.

They were the epicenter of all world culture, political and military power for a thousand years, and they know it. But now some fat guy in the West with his guns and McDonalds took it from them, and they became docile and passive. Now there is a new main character in the sequel, and they&#039;re bitter. I don&#039;t blame them. Some people&#039;s houses in Europe are older than our entire country&#039;s existence.

But the problem on this board is that flags are deceiving. You think you&#039;re talking to a Nigel or a Hans when you&#039;re really talking to a Ahmed or a Mehmet. These are usually easy to spot because they blame the US for every problem in the world and irrationally hate on it for every injustice.

It would be ridiculous for me to take a generalization from someone who has never been here as anything more than a grain of salt. Media of all kinds will always spin stories to appeal to a certain audience and those audiences will always restrict their viewing content to those sources. People will always see what they want to see in things they don&#039;t know beyond ink and paper with specifically selected photos attached. I live a comfortable life and am happy, if that somehow makes a dude living across the Atlantic upset, nothing will change in my life.

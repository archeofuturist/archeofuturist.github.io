It&#039;s in the NE. There&#039;s no reason to go there. Not a bad place to grow up in the 80&#039;s, but now the public schools are overrun with mexicans and blacks. It&#039;s easy enough to avoid contact with them. No good job opportunities there. Police department went bankrupt a few years back so they now justify their existence by savagely ticketing people for money. The people are generally annoying because they aren&#039;t very smart yet try to demonstrate how sophisticated they are by doing dumb shit like voting for Hillary. All or the surrounding areas are decent American folks.<br><br>Moved to New Hope for a while. It&#039;s beautiful. Good, peaceful place to be. Horse farms. People move here who failed at art careers in NYC or Philly so it has a sad, aging, new age bohemian vibe. A beer costs $12 at a bar. For some reason yuppies who work in the city have alternate homes here so this seems normal to them when they flock in on the weekends. The downtown seems like a tourist town even though it&#039;s not. Strange.<br><br>I live in Philadelphia now. Been here for 4 years and the novelty has already worn off. You can&#039;t even have trash cans because niggers steal them. Mail gets stolen regularly. Rent is too high for the shitty neighborhoods the buildings are in. I make all my dr appointments and use the DMV in the suburbs because apparently only black people are allowed to work here and they suck at their jobs. A trip to the post office is an hour long ordeal of shitty attitudes and filthy environments.<br> <br>I plan on leaving Philadelphia and buying a home in Bucks County. Maybe Bensalem, PA.

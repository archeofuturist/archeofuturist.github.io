Just a few years ago I used to be the edgiest teenage atheist intellectually narcissist little shit ever. Then as I grew towards nationalism I realized that religion has always been an integral part of every civilization, nation and culture and all the degeneracy in the world is a result of it disappearing. Despite still being an atheist I&#039;m against secularism because it eventually leads to the decay and erosion of a nation and its culture. A strong national unity is only created through religion. Even though I&#039;d want to be a believer, I just can&#039;t bring myself to it. Belief is a gift which I simply have not been given.","time":1493649448,"resto":123620913,"id":"DxKNlIuf","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":123627602,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)10:39:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123620913\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123620913<\/a><br>havnt changed at all except people think im part of the right even though im more of a socialist then those stupid cunts","time":1493649584,"resto":123620913,"id":"uzXaM11g","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":123627805,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)10:41:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123626810\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123626810<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The Holocaust happened<\/span><br>How?","time":1493649711,"resto":123620913,"id":"MNpLdknw","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123628135,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)10:45:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123620913\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123620913<\/a><br>Go agitate the trannies on lgbt. Your next step in evolution is figure out that while being a man or a woman doesnt neccesarrily mean you will or you must act one way, but overwhelmingly chances are you will so dont be surprised when traditional gender roles still persist. Then the next step is realizing this isnt because of socialization entirely but that there is a biological component which pushes men and women to have different temperment, personalties, as well as qualities they find attractive and things they find fulfilling. Then the next step is realizing that men and women in traditional roles are complementary not opposites. Then you realize that social norms regarding gender roles and obligations evolved in cultures by an itterative process generation after generation for centuries to accomodate these differences and create rules of society to benefit both men and women. Finally you realize that modern feminism seeks to destroy the accumulated centuries of social testing and optimization en toto and that outside certain limited areas of legality feminism was a mistake.

It may lead many to believe if their romantic love fades or diminishes then the marriage must be over or nearing its end.<br><br>This is my main problem with gay marriage. It further leads the culture into misunderstanding the purpose of marriage. Marriage is viewed as some sort of ultimate expression of romantic love\/sexual attraction, and not what it really is, a series of obligations and duties owed between a man and a woman to take care of one anothet and any children they might have.","time":1493653065,"resto":123620913,"id":"aerl8aS7","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123634048,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)11:39:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"Top 10 anime transformations: agnostic antifa to Christian ancap this past year.","filename":"1492367793309","ext":".jpg","w":960,"h":720,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1493653160387,"time":1493653160,"md5":"e32p2q278J3k3nK9D7VmQg==","fsize":121328,"resto":123620913,"id":"dHoFlAwU","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123634079,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)11:39:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123622370\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123622370<\/a><br>knowledge is power, ignorance is bliss","time":1493653180,"resto":123620913,"id":"Tg9BACUx","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123634289,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)11:41:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"They haven&#039;t necessarily changed, they simply became more defined and accurate as I went further down the rabbit hole.

Though just because I&#039;m socially liberal doesn&#039;t mean I think that everyone should need to kiss your ass; I just think on your own property and with your own money you should be able to do whatever you feel like, assuming others are not harmed by your decision. I think fiscal conservatism is a fair position given that others are made to pay into a tax pool, and those same people often don&#039;t get to decide where their tax dollars go.

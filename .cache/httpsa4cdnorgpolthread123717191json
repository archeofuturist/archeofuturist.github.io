Pi\u00f1era (center right, he already governed) is winning on polls.<br><br>i think feminism wasn&#039;t that much effective here cause we are mixed race. Feminist cannot blame the &quot;whitecismale opressor&quot;, here is only &quot;cismale opressor&quot;. Also from what i know Per\u00fa is really in a war against SJW, tv and radio shows are kicking their asses.<br><br>Argentina has Agustin Laje, an intelectual who is kinda of our Milo (but he has a social science base so he knows a lot about cultural Marxism -Gramsci, Marcusse, Laclau, etc). He is becoming like a star in social media. Feels good here. Women are improving and getting ashamed of feminism.

This kind of indirectness is hardly admirable, and is similar to the kind of indirectness involved in chicanery and duplicity. Small wonder Jefferson called Hamilton a monarchist.<br>The Articles of Confederation embodied an entirely different concept of indirect taxation. The United States was to levy a tax, not on individual property holders, but on each state, based on its aggregate land value. The assumption was that each state would levy a similar tax on each county, and so on down to the individual. In this way, the individual would never have to face a federal tax agent directly, and if the federal government did not have the full support of the states, it could not bully them as easily as it could bully individuals.<br><br>Unfortunately, states did not support the federal government to its satisfaction from the beginning (being strapped from the war). Rather than working things out patiently, Hamilton introduced power-centralizing measures into the new Constitution. One was the other kind of indirect taxation, the mosquito-bite kind that you don&#039;t see happening. Royal libertarians trumpet this covert taxation as a virtue over direct real estate taxation, even when it means that &quot;free trade&quot; is being taxed.","filename":"AnarchismTree09","ext":".gif","w":586,"h":378,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":80,"tim":1493218258991,"time":1493218258,"md5":"7QPD8RGPI7DZoPFc+kgttQ==","fsize":37377,"resto":122868009,"id":"v5qKSWPq","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122891238,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)10:51:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122891075\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122891075<\/a><br>then the Netherlands coasts aren&#039;t the product of labor ?","time":1493218266,"resto":122868009,"id":"Tnf6yc5P","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":122891290,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)10:51:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122868009\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122868009<\/a><br>Gentlemen, I have a dilemma that I cannot reconcile with right-libertarianism (i.e. Hoppe&#039;s conception of anarcho capitalism):<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The question of market induced degeneracy (e.g. strip clubs, pornography, prostitution, etc).<\/span><br><br>I have serious qualms with the hypersexual society of today and I do not see how it could be solved under anarcho-capitalism.

So, besides the fact that Locke&#039;s justification of privatizing land is far more limited than royal libertarians portray it to be, it is irrelevant to the question of land value tax, as it applies only to land that has no value.<br><br>Furthermore, Locke based his scenario on pre-monetary societies, where a landholder would find that &quot;it was useless, as well as dishonest, to carve himself too much, or take more than he needed.&quot; With the introduction of money, Locke noted, all land quickly became appropriated. Why? Because with money, those who can take more land than they have personal use for suddenly have reason to do so, as between them they will have taken all the land, and others will have to pay rent to them. So, with the introduction of money, the Lockean rationale for landed property falls apart, even according to Locke. And while Locke did not propose a remedy specifically for to this problem, he repeatedly stated that all taxes should be on real estate.","filename":"capita","ext":".jpg","w":571,"h":290,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":63,"tim":1493218376687,"time":1493218376,"md5":"W72SLUCJ6GP4ILTMYuThWw==","fsize":68580,"resto":122868009,"id":"v5qKSWPq","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122891526,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)10:53:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122890640\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122890640<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I can admit that the situation is extremely unlikely<\/span><br><br>compared to the average democracy, monarchy has always tended to be more libertarian in economic terms <br>again, monarchies averaged 3%-8% GDP in public spending <br>the most libertarian states right now are the fragments of the collapsed British empire: Singapore, Hong Kong, United Arab Emirates","time":1493218415,"resto":122868009,"id":"onPKXt4s","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122891527,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)10:53:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122891443\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122891443<\/a><br>The tragedy of the common misunderstanding<br><br>In their search for excuses to deny any common right to land, royal libertarians are fond of citing Garrett Hardin&#039;s work, &quot;Tragedy of the Commons.&quot; Or at least they cite the title, which is all most royal libertarians are familiar with.

The other would take the full rent, but would stipulate that the government can still only spend what the citizens authorize it to spend. The rest would be distributed on a per-capita basis.","filename":"willy","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":336,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":84,"tim":1493218812271,"time":1493218812,"md5":"f5IEpTYdzB\/nJ7KEauYaCQ==","fsize":45867,"resto":122868009,"id":"v5qKSWPq","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122892383,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)11:01:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"i love libertarian right generals.<br><br>good times lads.","filename":"1493121293430","ext":".png","w":820,"h":446,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":67,"tim":1493218863580,"time":1493218863,"md5":"ZGA7Ttj5SLEm1OUz839hAw==","fsize":560673,"resto":122868009,"id":"tCrfIXWv","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122892392,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)11:01:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122892275\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122892275<\/a><br>Ending excuses for big government<br><br>Much of the government spending to which libertarians strenuously object is made necessary by its taxing productivity instead of land values.<br>The property tax falls mostly on improvements, so less housing is built, giving the government an excuse to build public housing.

One is replacing all taxes on productivity, that is, on land use, with taxes on the value of land itself. The other is the Lockean pre-monetary system. It would have to rely on a judicial mechanism, whereby you assert your claim to land by demonstrating that you are using the land. While the latter method does not provide any community funds (a mixed blessing, perhaps), it does subject your landhold to the discretion of that judicial mechanism. It is far less intrusive into your business for the community to assess the market value of land than to assess the validity of what you are doing on that land.<br>Can&#039;t we do this without the state?<br><br>There are, in fact, proprietary communities operating on the single tax model. Arden, Delaware, with a population of 4900, has had no local taxes since 1900. The Arden Corporation collects a fair market rent on each land parcel, which is reappraised annually. (They actually collect only about a fourth of the rent to which they are entitled.) From that they not only pay for all the municipal services, but rebate all property taxes levied by the county and school district.<br>There are excellent reasons for libertarians to prefer the land trust route over the political route. Private communities can be built on explicit contracts (leases) with the citizens, can have internal democratic processes that are vastly superior to electoral democracy, can be far more flexible and free of state intervention, and can be downright profitable (even with trust investors pocketing a mere fraction of the rent). Most of all, dealing with investors is far more pleasant and self-affirming than dealing with politicians.","filename":"Henry-George-Progress-and-Poverty-191x300","ext":".jpg","w":191,"h":300,"tn_w":79,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493218942837,"time":1493218942,"md5":"h0UPHF2qj5EJhKvgXVvK6A==","fsize":13372,"resto":122868009,"id":"v5qKSWPq","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122892661,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)11:03:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122892559\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122892559<\/a><br>Geolibertarians<br><br>We are libertarians who make the classical liberal distinction between land, labor and capital.

It doesn&#039;t even recognize that there is such a thing as common resources. Georgism corrects this flaw by not only recognizing common resources like land, minerals, water, fish stocks as such, but adds that by managing these resources with user fees, you can get rid of all other taxation and remove impediments to economic development. So under Georgism, regular folk are mostly taxed in proportion to the value of any land they may possess. The vast majority of people would pay a lot less than they currently pay in income, payroll and consumption taxes, but absentee landlords would pay a lot more, and the mortgage business of banks would be an order of magnitude smaller, because land taxes cancel the benefits of homeownership as an investment. The system also discourages the inefficient use of land, controlling sprawl and inefficient farming practices. Housing and transportation costs would be greatly reduced, thus allowing for a greater equality of opportunity. A Universal basic income (UBI) could provide for those unable to work.","filename":"60614","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":325,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":81,"tim":1493221744778,"time":1493221744,"md5":"yvICFrUjjQmgiPzah7YUKQ==","fsize":55771,"resto":122868009,"id":"v5qKSWPq","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122897917,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)11:50:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122897028\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122897028<\/a><br><a href=\"#p122896823\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122896823<\/a><br><a href=\"#p122894430\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122894430<\/a><br><a href=\"#p122896407\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122896407<\/a><br><br>t. wehraboos","filename":"Wehrboos","ext":".png","w":346,"h":1133,"tn_w":38,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493221822225,"time":1493221822,"md5":"EhMKNZZVIRVi6d4jPL8stg==","fsize":403909,"resto":122868009,"id":"IlZRVKQ1","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122898087,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)11:51:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122897670\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122897670<\/a><br><br>FOX, CNN, and MSNBC aren&#039;t government-owned.

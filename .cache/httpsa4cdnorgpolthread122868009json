America has never had a truly free market in the right-libertarian sense. You could argue that the west did, but let&#039;s be honest the government has had a role sense day one. Frankly, I feel like that offers a more healthy market with more choices for me.<br><br><a href=\"#p122873100\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122873100<\/a><br>I wouldn&#039;t have the ability to exercise free will without myself, my society and my government to build a system based on rights and freedoms.","time":1493206176,"resto":122868009,"id":"E2m9wP\/S","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122873942,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)07:31:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122873671\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122873671<\/a><br>That&#039;s pretty much only looking at the first mechanism (short-term rates to long-term rates).

It&#039;s very niche in terms of the literature but pretty fascinating nonetheless. I frankly think most central banks don&#039;t have a clue what they are doing, they&#039;re just relying on expansionary monetary and fiscal policy (mainly aimed at keep stocks afloat) in some vague hope that real and sustainable growth will return and the debt will somehow disappear. They sit their with their models and tinker away but at some point it&#039;ll be rendered totally ineffective and they&#039;ll have to start all over again. Hopefully that event doesn&#039;t come in the form of a sudden meltdown but I fear it will.","filename":"1491846253583","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":669,"tn_w":93,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493206903366,"time":1493206903,"md5":"mBuZkeoQ96g8mFy82Nc4jw==","fsize":71750,"resto":122868009,"id":"CXxOZNIY","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122875029,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)07:44:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122869613\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122869613<\/a><br>If you want to voluntary participate in an economic system or community that matches your values you are free to travel and contract yourself so.

Think of your AnCapistan preset. Unlike Antifa anarchists, you have to think about what comes after achieving a stateless system. What should happen? People get together in groups, people they agree with. Voluntarily they form communities with their own rules they can all agree on. They basically form a microstate. Hoppe libertarianism is NOT stateless, but it hasn&#039;t a government that dares to call itself a representative of people who diasgree with its rules. Forming your own country is not possible in our current system, you have to bend over for your country&#039;s rules. Once you have created said microstate, you are allowed to let anyone in or ban anyone from getting in, as owner of the property it is your decision. It has some parallels with Feudalism, with the owner of the property being the &quot;lord&quot;, but since there exists a free market of communities, he will try to please his fellow inhabitants to not lose them. Also, a main issue of traditional feudalism also doesn&#039;t exist, the succession of blood. You don&#039;t have a hereditary system but rather a meritocratiy. Not nobles but anybody who has the skill of achieving something can get into the role of owning a property. You don&#039;t need to be born into that role, you can work to achieve it. But nothing stops you from just living in the community if you don&#039;t want to take the risk of investing and possibly failing. basically, it is applying the free market on gated communities.","time":1490806858,"resto":118768723,"id":"E0dLw2ra","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":118805930,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)13:01:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118805445\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118805445<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;If you&#039;re selling shit while using somebody else&#039;s branding<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;so people buying counterfeit goods are destroying coorporations?

Science for the motherfricking epic win. Don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve seen the s**t I\u2019ve been sharing on Facebook, but it\u2019s a lot of stuff about science and how f**king epically motherbitching sick it is. It\u2019s cool to talk about science using swear words. The swear words make the science better.<br><br>You see what Takei posted the other day? Yeah, the funny picture with big words written over the picture. Epic much? The man knows his internet \u2013 he\u2019s practically made of win. His posts are basically just a big order of win with a side of f**king epic bacon and a bunch of f**king sriracha sauce poured on top. s**t yes. Science.<br><br>My favorite scientist? No question, it\u2019s Tesla. Tesla is for the win. He\u2019s win and Edison is fail. If Edison was around today, I\u2019d kick him in the dick. I hate Thomas Edison and love Tesla because of some insanely freaking epic webcomics I\u2019ve read, where he\u2019s riding a dinosaur and just doing altogether random s**t. Tesla much? He\u2019s epic as hell, which, by the way, is where Edison is. Or he would be, if hell was a real place, which it\u2019s not. That reminds me, you see that image macro about how stupid those failshit Christians are? Bacon for the win.<br><br>Science\u2026 f**k yeah. The cool part about learning science on Facebook is that they use pictures and the words aren\u2019t very big and you get to browse Facebook the entire time. Plus, the swearing. You can\u2019t swear in school which is bullshit. I think I would like school a lot more if it was compacted down into meme format. Like instead of summer reading we could just look at like 10 to 20 different memes a day. Neil deGrasse Tyson for the motherepic s**t win.<br><br>Science Wonka, Science Grumpy Cat \u2013 just like sriracha, there\u2019s nothing that can\u2019t be improved by adding science. Tell that to those insane Christians down in the South though. I\u2019m not afraid to say it \u2013 religion is a huge fail.","time":1493119343,"resto":122723041,"id":"2l2EH7lh","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":122723934,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)07:25:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122723041\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122723041<\/a><br>OY VEY ITS ANUTHA SHOA!","filename":"ayy holup","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":482,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":120,"tim":1493119528898,"time":1493119528,"md5":"AU7DH5Uy+G2XRkxuFS0sKw==","fsize":172233,"resto":122723041,"id":"XtNXZxwm","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"}]}

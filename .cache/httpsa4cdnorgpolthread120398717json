I know this: The fact people are so obsessed with ruining this board is a statement to the truth. All signs point up. I always use these situations to evaluate my life,, to really delve into why I believe what I believe, and create action toward living my life the way it was meant to be. This does not stun me, Nor does it make me afraid. I already explained yesterday how to defeat you, and then you confronted me. This is as the prophecy says: By day I shine, but overnight you bring me down. Like horus and isis... But you see, the sun always shines, it&#039;s just at certain points we don&#039;t see it shine. Like the small businesses that are a background to you and I. Littered on the streets near the corporate strip mall. Or the homeless meth addict in the ghetto. I feel like you want to win over yourselves truly, you want a fight because what you stand for is dark. You must embrace the light, by diving into the deepest pit of your despair. There you will know why, and from there, you can shine\/It was Sunday today, but tomorrow I call for a prayer in unison. A prayer to find the truth about our lives. Or maybe you already know, and this is simply an echo chamber. Either way: may god be with Russia, Syria, and liberals...They all need him the most.","filename":"thVQUY0XUN","ext":".jpg","w":289,"h":213,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":184,"tim":1491802259542,"time":1491802259,"md5":"KX87x+523YMz4jlqmzFNCA==","fsize":34392,"resto":0,"id":"M8\/X+5C6","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"i-cant-tell","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

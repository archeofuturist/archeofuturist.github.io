When do you think a brain scan like pic related is? It is a static, low rez copy of the brain&#039;s information. The brain is nothing but a lot of nerves connected to each other, sending signals in set patterns. We can already scan for this information, just not at the resolution we need to get all the details just yet. Then of course we need to work out which patterns mean what, but that is being worked on and already showing progress.","filename":"brain-scan","ext":".jpg","w":620,"h":350,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":70,"tim":1493229593199,"time":1493229593,"md5":"rt9RnOa0b+iPNxMZGGCIcQ==","fsize":64774,"resto":122899725,"id":"LdkrqZCT","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

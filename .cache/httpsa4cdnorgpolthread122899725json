They see that as no different from death. I think a good middle ground is gradual brain augmentation. Upgrade a little at a time so the cognitive flow is uninterrupted. Most of the cells in your body were not there 7 years ago, but they are replaced at such a low rate you don&#039;t notice you can a different body than you did before, thus the Ego is undisturbed. Exposure to VR and the disassociation\/ego death that comes along with it will probably help get people over that as well.","time":1493223151,"resto":122899725,"id":"LdkrqZCT","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122901662,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)12:20:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122900528\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122900528<\/a><br>So you give no value to the neural networks being developed, like the one that beat the best Go player?","time":1493223618,"resto":122899725,"id":"LdkrqZCT","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122901760,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)12:21:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122899725\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122899725<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Roid or Droid?<\/span><br>Groid.","time":1493223670,"resto":122899725,"id":"fk4wJNV5","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":122902026,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)12:23:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122900666\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122900666<\/a><br>Yeah, gradual replacing is the way to go, if we can simulate neurons at the brains granularity it&#039;d be simple.

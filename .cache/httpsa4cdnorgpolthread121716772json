Such a creature would be a being with no heritage or history. No past or lineage. The whole of its existence would be a huge fluke of probability. But my question to you is:<br><br>Should such a creature have rights? Why or why not? Do you think that such a thing should be protected or given a special status? Why or why not? What do you think it would be like to be a boltzmanite, knowing that you are the only of your kind and only exist because of a lucky roll of the dice and nothing else?<br><br>And then wider than that what does it take for a creature to be considered a person?

Even asian art of recent centuries, beautiful in it&#039;s own way, didn&#039;t approach the work of greek sculpture or renaissance and enlightenment age European art. Again, it&#039;s important to stress that most races as a group are not capable of crafting an aesthetic that approaches high european art. So the art of the time will reflect the current race that rules our culture. This is currently the Jews, who have always had a uniquely disgusting esthetic. Hitler was not the first one to point out that jews tend to praise the ugly, revolting, dark, and terrifying. But I&#039;ve been to jewish history and art museums and it&#039;s very true. Not to say that individuals of a race can&#039;t make good art in a classical style, but the average of our era will reflect the average aesthetics of that race. Much like culture --one or two races can make it, other can maintain it, and some quickly destroy it. Art is just one element of culture.","time":1490911751,"resto":118975236,"id":"KwuIzKb4","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118976141,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)18:09:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118975236\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118975236<\/a><br>its bretty cool desu","time":1490911773,"resto":118975236,"id":"t2pAO3y4","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118976270,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)18:10:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118975236\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118975236<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What the fuck is wrong with the modern art?

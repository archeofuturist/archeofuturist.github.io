Bush grew worse. Manafort pitched the plans to Russian aluminum magnate Oleg Deripaska, a close Putin ally with whom Manafort eventually signed a $10 million annual contract beginning in 2006, according to interviews with several people familiar with payments to Manafort and business records obtained by the AP. Manafort and Deripaska maintained a business relationship until at least 2009, according to one person familiar with the work.","time":1490190390,"resto":117757871,"id":"DtayL19Y","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":117759524,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)09:48:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117757871\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117757871<\/a><br>Thread theme<br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=PEr<wbr>UiAyVoGc","time":1490190484,"resto":117757871,"id":"3vpFqcMj","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117760055,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)09:54:13","name":"Anonymous","filename":"2016-08-18T12-35-47-766Z--1280x720.video_770x443","ext":".jpg","w":770,"h":433,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1490190853620,"time":1490190853,"md5":"AGqPyg+UYy5hc8DU37gidw==","fsize":60823,"resto":117757871,"id":"DtayL19Y","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":117760540,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)09:58:32","name":"Anonymous","filename":"downloadfile","ext":".png","w":658,"h":1165,"tn_w":70,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490191112664,"time":1490191112,"md5":"6jaZqdPho8xeTJwtOVUx1w==","fsize":200147,"resto":117757871,"id":"DtayL19Y","country":"FR","country_name":"France"}]}

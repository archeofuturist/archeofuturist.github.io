But thinking about this almost incredible episode does tell one something about the nature of civilisation.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; It shows that however complex and solid it seems, it is actually quite fragile. It can be destroyed.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; What are its enemies? First of all, fear. Fear of war, fear of invasion, fear of plague and famine, that make it simply not worthwhile constructing things, or planting trees, or even planning next year&#039;s crops. Fear of the supernatural, which means that you daren&#039;t question anything or change anything.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; And then exhaustion, the feeling of hopelessness which can overtake people even with a high degree of material prosperity. There is a poem by the Greek poet, Cavafy, in which he imagines the people of an antique town like Alexandria waiting every day for the barbarians to come and sack the city. Finally, the barbarians move off somewhere else and the city is saved; but the people are disappointed - it would have been better than nothing.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Vigour, energy, vitality: all the civilisations, or civilising epochs, have had a weight of energy behind them.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; People sometimes think that civilisation consists in fine sensibilities and good conversations and all that. These can be among the agreeable results of civilisation, but they are not what make a civilisation. A society can have these amenities and yet be dead and rigid.<\/span><br><br>Are we on the wrong path?","filename":"Lord-Clark","ext":".jpg","w":2560,"h":1536,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":150,"tim":1492349227039,"time":1492349227,"md5":"qWosH2FgZG34GPx6dkxZhA==","fsize":412193,"resto":0,"id":"o50DTg0z","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"it-took-gibbon-six-volumes-to-describe-the","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":121359489,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)09:43:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121358085\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121358085<\/a><br>Notice the path of the rainbow or crescents is always crooked?

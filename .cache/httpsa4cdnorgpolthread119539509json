All popular religions are misdirections away from the true mysteries followed by the enlightened and the chosen. There is species that has transcended this universe and become &quot;God&quot; of sorts. This species has traveled through time and between universes to try to create an eternal universe. Our encounters with it have led to many religions in their current forms today. Their existence echos in our reality. There are also components of the universe itself, beings that always were, forces manifested in the tangible reality that serve the original directive of the cosmos. Order, chaos, creation, destruction, etc. The divine species cannot destroy them. They are eternal in a way that is difficult for mortal organisms to comprehend. One of these organisms is the one you call &quot;Kek.&quot; Its directive is to test different species in the universe. When a species achieves a level of sentience, civilization, and\/or psychic activity, a schism occurs.","time":1491353481,"resto":119539509,"id":"euJHTxfe","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119543123,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)20:51:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"A &quot;moment of truth&quot; in history of the species. Chaos erupts and this draws &quot;Kek&quot; to the world in question. There it dwells, whispering its creed to the denizens of the planet further driving some of them to madness and creating a larger fissure. Others are used as amplifiers, priests and priestesses, for &quot;Kek&#039;s&quot; will. Eventually &quot;Kek&quot; either devours the the unworthy of the species and leaves behind the cosmic chosen to oversee the next step of the species evolution or it devours the whole species entirely and makes room for a new organism to rise up. The divine species, God, cannot change the fundamental properties of the universe. It can destroy beings like &quot;Kek&quot; but they always return in the past, the future, somewhere and things go on as they must. Yet the divine was once a species like Man, billions of years ago, tested by &quot;Kek&quot; and the others. The battles between the divine and beings like &quot;Kek&quot; are also imposed on our reality. The whole idea that we&#039;re in a simulation. In a way we are. Not in a computer, but in a non-fixed reality altered by an unseen war.","time":1491353503,"resto":119539509,"id":"euJHTxfe","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119543262,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)20:53:12","name":"Deathstroke","com":"<a href=\"#p119539653\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119539653<\/a><br>You mean Odinism then, not the faux-prophet that is jewish....","time":1491353592,"resto":119539509,"id":"7B8TL800","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119543426,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)20:54:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119543262\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119543262<\/a><br>No he means Tengriism.","time":1491353689,"resto":119539509,"id":"KoinBDK3","country":"HU","country_name":"Hungary"},{"no":119543665,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)20:57:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119543426\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119543426<\/a><br>OP is Arabic so it&#039;d be Arabic polytheism.","time":1491353837,"resto":119539509,"id":"Msgpbulc","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119543763,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)20:58:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119543665\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119543665<\/a><br>Or Haruhiism.","filename":"1291778878241","ext":".png","w":1600,"h":900,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1491353894112,"time":1491353894,"md5":"5L5+\/FY\/xBg9T+BNpR1Wlg==","fsize":380626,"resto":119539509,"id":"KoinBDK3","country":"HU","country_name":"Hungary"},{"no":119543883,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)20:59:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"The divine species is the end point for all species. It is the perfect evolution of both biology and technology that all evolution culminates to in time, if the species survives long enough. Yet despite this, the forces woven into the universe, the universe itself, seems to have a purpose of its own to allow such a species to come about and further allow other species to progress towards becoming this divine species. Its reasoning is beyond comprehension as are its methods. It may only be a sick principle of existence that the purpose for any species is either extinction or to become a caretaker of the universe. It may be that a force even greater than the divine species exists and is creating an army over the course of billions of years to invade other universes. The truth is seemingly impossible to know until the moment when it must be known.","time":1491353962,"resto":119539509,"id":"euJHTxfe","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119544919,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)21:09:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119539509\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119539509<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;TL;DR give me a religion to become a member of.<\/span><br><br>Roman Catholic<br><br>See causality and St. Thomas Aquinas","time":1491354553,"resto":119539509,"id":"mRJz9\/BF","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"}]}

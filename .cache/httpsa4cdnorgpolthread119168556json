What I am truly astonished by is how little these things and many other damning facts were presented during his rise to the present looming disaster. Within 24 hours this mediocrity of a man with such low ability and almost totally lacking in intellectual curiosity and moral sensibility will be assured of ascending to the most powerful office in the world. We have been incredibly lucky in our history to have great men in office when they were so badly needed. We can only hope that no major crisis emerges. I am not optimistic as Trump seems to be relatively incapable of self control. If I were a believer I would pray, but no one is coming save us from ourselves. The world is a dangerous place and we have turned over leadership to an immature, impulsive, self-involved, thin-skinned, baby man with a fourth graders vocabulary.

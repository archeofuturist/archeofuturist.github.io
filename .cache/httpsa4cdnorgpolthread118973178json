The stakes are much higher here. We are truly free because we can lose our freedoms. The American system encourages complacency, cultural marxism, and sophism.<br>Authoritarians in Australia do not have to subvert anything, they can simply speak their mind.","filename":"1490026968796","ext":".jpg","w":859,"h":647,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":188,"tim":1490910270489,"time":1490910270,"md5":"Mc6Xl+eILFPP7T8rBBOPIg==","fsize":72987,"resto":0,"id":"zvve4Q+k","country":"AU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"democracy","country_name":"Australia","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

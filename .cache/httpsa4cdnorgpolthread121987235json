It will dock with their space station, Tiangong-1, to resupply it with water, fuel, and other essentials. It will then re-enter the Earth&#039;s atmosphere and burn up.<br><br>It doesn&#039;t look like Tianzhou has return capability (The SpaceX Dragon can return anything placed inside the vehicle, the Trunk burns up in the atmosphere. A few other vehicles can return things to Earth), but this is a major advancement in China&#039;s space program.<br><br>China is planning to launch the first module of it&#039;s future space station next year, so this resupply craft is vital.<br><br>Pic related is Tianzhou-1. Say something nice to it.","filename":"tianzhou1-tianjin-testing-3-cgtn","ext":".png","w":852,"h":475,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":139,"tim":1492689416216,"time":1492689416,"md5":"RpuFQGG0XlnMs2hJsLmKaA==","fsize":580731,"resto":0,"id":"C38REJlD","country":"AU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"china-launches-their-first-unmanned-space","country_name":"Australia","replies":3,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":121987398,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)07:58:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121987235\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121987235<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;other essentials<\/span><br>dogs?","time":1492689538,"resto":121987235,"id":"43Ybv45d","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":121987430,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)07:59:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121987235\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121987235<\/a><br>Is this literally a rice rocket?<br>I mean, how much rice are they sending up ?","time":1492689564,"resto":121987235,"id":"gulGVrB0","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121987586,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)08:01:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121987398\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121987398<\/a><br>Maybe in the future!

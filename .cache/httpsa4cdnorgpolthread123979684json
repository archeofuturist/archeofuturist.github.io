And this &quot;we need 60 votes&quot; is a very new rule, so that begs the question - who created that rule and why the number 60? The point is that over half of America voted for a republican Senate, a republican House, and a republican Presidency. Yet we are once again, as we did all eight years of Obama, handing everything to the dems. Everything the dems want, the dems get. There comes a point where you have to go back to the way our government was supposed to be run, and stand up for the will of the people. And the will of the people voted for republicans to push a very specific agenda, and the republicans, including Traitor Trump, are instead bowing down to the dems and doing the will of the globalist commies.<br><br>#FireKushner<br>#FireIvanka<br>#TraitorTrump","time":1493863641,"resto":123979684,"id":"RKy\/ffVX","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124003879,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)22:22:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123983317\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123983317<\/a><br><a href=\"#p123982871\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123982871<\/a><br><a href=\"#p123983317\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123983317<\/a><br><a href=\"#p124001763\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124001763<\/a>","filename":"5cb3fdbad26bf0cc0aceac8125de966cfd4d1ab223c0fcc1c784a8a73a523688","ext":".png","w":410,"h":422,"tn_w":121,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493864533746,"time":1493864533,"md5":"QaWalmcTo2Xoj\/aCKkYheg==","fsize":10841,"resto":123979684,"id":"EHfUPV9x","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124004311,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)22:26:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123992587\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123992587<\/a><br>Sounds like you&#039;re the new one.

He said they were to be used sparingly and only when whatever was about to be passed was monumental and would cause serious, major changes. The way I understood it, you would use the filibuster if what they wanted to pass was something that would cause extreme change. Thus, it was used sparingly. Yet, the dems (and sometimes sthe republs) are now pretty much using the filibuster for every single bill only because the other side wants it. <br><br>So, because of that, he said McConnel should use the nuclear option to pass Trump&#039;s budget, instead of caving in tot he dems and giving the dems this budget. <br><br>It was interesting but since I was busy, that is all I caught and I have not researched it.","time":1493866678,"resto":123979684,"id":"RKy\/ffVX","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

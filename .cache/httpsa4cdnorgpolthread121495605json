Nationalism and racialism, but respect all tribes or race, just as you would creatures of the animal kingdom but of course moreso. Roman Catholicism should be the only allowed official religion in all European nations. Restore Christendom. Make military crusader units. Nuclear bombers with crusader crosses. Establish a high-tech Christian police state that monitors all crime\/sins and heretical activity. Build architecture that endures forever and is a testimony to our beliefs- I&#039;m talking about skyscraper gothic cathedrals. Rewrite history lessons to make the Inquisition, the Crusades, and all right-wing nationalist movements to be decent things as opposed to for-sure negative (including much of what went on during WW2). Make atheism illegal. Divorce discouraged. Pornography illegal. Homosexuality viewed as a disorder. Remove the death penalty so that murderers and others receive a lifetime of solitary confinement where the ghosts of their victims and the devils eat away at their soul by God&#039;s will. Alliance with Russian crusaders against the rest of the godless world.","filename":"grail_knight","ext":".jpg","w":400,"h":230,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":143,"tim":1492413343703,"time":1492413343,"md5":"JyFHSBWFz8R8s\/9lGG7+2w==","fsize":137321,"resto":0,"id":"RtoXqXeh","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"what-kind-of-world-do-we-really-want","country_name":"United States","replies":46,"images":8,"unique_ips":35},{"no":121496587,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)03:27:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121495605\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121495605<\/a><br>So a christian theocratic world... kinda like the muslim caliphate?

The way that libtards bend truth and reality in order to satisfy their illogical and defective minds. In math we have axioms, the things we presume are true in order to put them together and form new truths. But normies have faulty axioms, they put them together ina semi logical manner but if the basic ideas are themselves wrong everything is corrupted.

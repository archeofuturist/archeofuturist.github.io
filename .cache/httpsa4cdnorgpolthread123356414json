They happily tell everybody that exploding Muslims are an elite-generated spook to foster hatred among white people, but refuse to ask themselves whether the inherent belief that every single in-group and in-group preference should be dissolved to make way for a super in-group that somehow involves the entirety of mankind will actually create social cohesion, or just erase it.<br><br>And like in your fucking retarded little picture, these dumb motherfucks will tell you that &quot;while you were screaming about minorities&quot; the elite gave themselves raises and automated you out of fifty bajillion jobs. They&#039;ll do this and never ONCE ask themselves how the reduction of available jobs could ever possibly justify the importing of a literal army of foreign scabs to bloat the market of people looking for the jobs that are constantly decreasing.<br><br>They do this because they are the footsoldiers of the elite. Because they realized that something has to be done about rich people, and then got roped into abandoning the blatant nationalist perspective we might have used to effectively oppose it, convincing themselves that the elite are coming at them from the angle of white men instead of a bunch of rich kikes that hate them.<br><br>To the effect that a country that once won a civil war over literal fucking taxes against the British empire is now literally incapable of finding the wherewithall to get its shit together and hang the most corrupt legion of elite moneygrubbers in human history because its population is composed of sugar addicted faggots who hate the white men who are the most likely to lead the revolt and think that niggers and women make for good soldiers despite their continued refusal to ever do anything functional.<br><br>The left does that.

Because Nietzsche\u2019s contribution to modernity and to modern intellectual thinking is there may be things which may be prior, but we don\u2019t know what they are, and we have to test them through struggle, through life, through will and purposiveness, and various levels of what he called Will to Power which he believed was the basis of all lived existence. So, Nietzsche says God is dead partly to say he\u2019s a militant atheist but partly to say that the idea of God in the minds of men has died, which means that theoretically it may not have completely died but is in a point of collapse. Because the point is to test and to rearrange, and you put up a view and I will attack it because life is struggle. And in that struggle comes out the possibility of meaning. Nietzsche would say, \u201cThere is a truth but I don\u2019t know it yet.\u201d There is a degree to which ontological circumstances cannot be proved but are not rendered prior meaningless, which is why Nietzsche approaches nihilism, the belief that there is no purpose and no values and no constraints and no morals that aren\u2019t purely human, and that there is nothing outside. Which, of course, makes it very difficult to run any sort of a civilization because there are no lines.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;And Nietzsche stands halfway between what you might call this existential Leftist praxis and Heidegger. Nietzsche\u2019s become extremely fashionable on the Left in the last thirty years and there\u2019s lots of post-modernist books by people like Deleuze and Guattari, and these sorts of people, who love the element of Nietzsche that tears down\u2014\u201cI come as a destroyer!\u201d\u2014because in order to create you\u2019ve got to destroy first, you\u2019ve got to level off a bit.

The American constitution talks about liberty, talks about property, talks about happiness. Heidegger doesn\u2019t think the purpose of life is happiness; the purpose of life is death and facing ontology. But he doesn\u2019t put it in the vocabulary that you must fall before the one who is on the cross and who bleeds for us because, in a sense, Heidegger just increasingly sees those as forms of metaphysics for metaphysics, stuff that needs to be put out of the way so that one can concentrate on the cardinal things of life, death, spirituality, and the possible existence of God.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u201cGod\u201d, as he told Paul Celan when they met in \u201967, \u201chas always been with me.\u201d Celan is interesting of course, a Jewish poet who wrote in German for which he was condemned by his own group and converted to Catholicism because of Heidegger\u2019s influence.

This is one of the things that interests me very much about him. With this Right-wing group, for example, a few Christians turned up early, they went, and it\u2019s largely pagan in orientation. In the New Right in Europe, and so on, you have this very great split between the two. Heidegger\u2019s almost totally unconcerned with those things because the forms that people worship Being in being through are incidental to placing man before ontological prerequisites. His view is that you base life and society upon the profound thinking that will impinge upon a man of full consciousness, not [unintelligible] debilitated, before his moment of death. And that\u2019s why he joined the Nazi Party. That\u2019s why virtually no one could understand why he\u2019d joined it, because he was totally sort of unorthodox in ideological terms because he had very little interest in that.<\/span>","time":1490889836,"resto":118927147,"id":"oXQRTe+f","country":"GB","trip":"!!nIHFObhTBdm","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118934650,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)12:04:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118934591\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118934591<\/a><br>That&#039;s what I just said you fucking spacker.","time":1490889870,"resto":118927147,"id":"Mp0ASPG7","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118934687,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)12:04:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118934321\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118934321<\/a><br>but now its taboo it isnt gonna be the good ones its gonna be slags who forgot to take the pill.<br>They wouldnt be worse than niggers back then","time":1490889896,"resto":118927147,"id":"z8AdKCTs","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118934776,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)12:05:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;be me<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;History student<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;browsing a second hand book stall<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;pick up Tolstoy&#039;s War &amp; Peace in two volumes for \u00a34<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;absolute bargain<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;meticulously browse history section<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;gain sudden thirst for the forbidden fruit of third reich history<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;that fruit, of course, being David Irving<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;take Tolstoy to the stall owner<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;whip out \u00a310 note with Her Majesty&#039;s face on<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;God Save The Queen<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;politely make conversation as I wait for my change<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;decide this is my chance to ask the question<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;I was browsing the History section and was wondering where you pick up the books?&quot;<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;Who&#039;re you looking for?&quot;<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;autisticly um and ah as I build up courage to say the tainted name<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;Well, I was looking for some David Irving&quot;<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;gives me a suspicious look as he tells me I&#039;m unlikely to find any Irving<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;all of it&#039;s online for the Nazis to buy<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;pretend I was just curious and actually hate Irving<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;quickly walk away<\/span><br><br>Great, now I can never use that book stall because if the owner sees me again he&#039;ll call get hold of an officer and have me yanked away to prison for anti-Semitism.","filename":"1475093980119","ext":".gif","w":305,"h":320,"tn_w":119,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490889954510,"time":1490889954,"md5":"NEX7sAElMUaSmgjs9+b05g==","fsize":911539,"resto":118927147,"id":"p\/3o6QXk","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118934780,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)12:05:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118934650\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118934650<\/a><br>No it isn&#039;t.","time":1490889956,"resto":118927147,"id":"Ywh6uzER","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118934840,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)12:06:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118933854\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118933854<\/a><br>He&#039;s a loon.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;We must be aware that those who observe us from afar are worried.

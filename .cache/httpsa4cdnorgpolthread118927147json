Because Nietzsche\u2019s contribution to modernity and to modern intellectual thinking is there may be things which may be prior, but we don\u2019t know what they are, and we have to test them through struggle, through life, through will and purposiveness, and various levels of what he called Will to Power which he believed was the basis of all lived existence. So, Nietzsche says God is dead partly to say he\u2019s a militant atheist but partly to say that the idea of God in the minds of men has died, which means that theoretically it may not have completely died but is in a point of collapse. Because the point is to test and to rearrange, and you put up a view and I will attack it because life is struggle. And in that struggle comes out the possibility of meaning. Nietzsche would say, \u201cThere is a truth but I don\u2019t know it yet.\u201d There is a degree to which ontological circumstances cannot be proved but are not rendered prior meaningless, which is why Nietzsche approaches nihilism, the belief that there is no purpose and no values and no constraints and no morals that aren\u2019t purely human, and that there is nothing outside. Which, of course, makes it very difficult to run any sort of a civilization because there are no lines.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;And Nietzsche stands halfway between what you might call this existential Leftist praxis and Heidegger. Nietzsche\u2019s become extremely fashionable on the Left in the last thirty years and there\u2019s lots of post-modernist books by people like Deleuze and Guattari, and these sorts of people, who love the element of Nietzsche that tears down\u2014\u201cI come as a destroyer!\u201d\u2014because in order to create you\u2019ve got to destroy first, you\u2019ve got to level off a bit.

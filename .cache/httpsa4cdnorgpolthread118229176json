Yeah, it stings the skins a little, you can even get a bruise, that&#039;s not a deterrent.

Same thing with stun guns, same thing with most pepper spray (with the exception of Fox labs mean green and Saber red defense), but then again antifas wear respirators and splash goggles for that, so not going to help.","time":1490452716,"resto":118229176,"id":"kACPanLi","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":118230548,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)10:41:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118229176\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118229176<\/a><br>You know, I think it can be dangerous for you.

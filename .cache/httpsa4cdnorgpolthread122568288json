But the last time danish women had more then 2.0 children per women was in 1968! And it&#039;s the same all over the western world. Also, the average age for the first child for a woman was as high as 31, and is still 30 or 29 to this day. A woman&#039;s fertility starts to drop at 25, from there on out she will statistically give birth to weaker children. And whaday y know. The iq and testosterone for male children started to drop in the 80&#039;s. I know this because we test for iq in the danish draft. And here is the kicker, the welfare state expanded like crazy since the 70&#039;s. So I&#039;m paying for a massive welfare state that provides fewer and dumber and weaker children that can&#039;t support the welfare state women themselves voted in. Women love to fuck, but don&#039;t tell me they love to procreate, because they have had every chance in Denmark to procreate with &quot;the chads&quot; and have the welfare state pay for it, and they have not done it! A danish woman with children gets so much money that even if she has no job, she is still not technically poor, and when I mean poor, I mean she is above the median income in Denmark. So you get my anger? Denmark has maybe had the most generous system ever created in world history for allowing women to procreate with all the best males, and they somehow managed to fuck it up.","time":1493036827,"resto":122568288,"id":"Jbxj2Jaz","country":"DK","country_name":"Denmark"},{"no":122580257,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)08:27:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122568370\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122568370<\/a><br>Frog I...","filename":"1492934375556","ext":".gif","w":421,"h":248,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":73,"tim":1493036831321,"time":1493036831,"md5":"RshyJ\/qs2Y\/aIOg5G13O1g==","fsize":101918,"resto":122568288,"id":"vD94bTrl","country":"CL","country_name":"Chile"},{"no":122580286,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)08:27:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122579894\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122579894<\/a><br>All of my kids are my own","filename":"1492797123064","ext":".png","w":624,"h":640,"tn_w":121,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493036855335,"time":1493036855,"md5":"TY2Ekf6ZP2O4qRMgXtCL8A==","fsize":192912,"resto":122568288,"id":"fa6IuAAj","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122580297,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)08:27:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122579703\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122579703<\/a><br>Your right about logic.

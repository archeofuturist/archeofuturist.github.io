Muslims are walking around with ISIS flags in broad daylight. And yet they are going to elect the French Tony Blair, the most globalist, pro-European, pro-Immigration slimy cunt imaginable. Forget Round 2, this is going to be a coronation. France is DEAD and its people, just like the gutless Germans before them, have willingly allowed this to happen. They have betrayed their culture, their heritage and their children.<br><br>France and Germany will burn. At least the British had the guts to vote out of Europe, to retain some control of our future and to stick 2 fingers up to the vile, globalist filth that run the EU.

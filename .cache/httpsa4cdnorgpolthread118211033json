Atheism is in decline worldwide, with the number of atheists falling from 4.5% of the world&#039;s population in 1970 to 2.0% in 2010 and projected to drop to 1.8% by 2020, <br><br>Real surveys and statistics say atheism is on the decline worldwide. Sorry atheists but atheism is not on the rise nor is it winning. It&#039;s still the minority and a declining one at that. <br><br>The Pew Research Center&#039;s statistics show that atheism is expected to continue to decline all the way into 2050 with a continued growth of religion. Other research also shows a huge surge in growth for Christianity in China which is currently the world&#039;s most &quot;atheist&quot; nation because of the atheist communist government suppressing religion, the research suggests that China will soon become the world&#039;s most Christian nation within 15 years. <br><br>This is simply history repeating itself: Christianity prospered in Rome back in the ancient era when it was suppressed and it still grew in the militant atheist soviet Russia when it was suppressed there only a century ago with the majority of Russians today now also identifying as Christian. Just goes to show that atheist suppression of religion still doesn&#039;t stop religion.<br><br>Sources for the legion of whiny \/Redditor\/ fedoras that will no doubt show up it this thread:<br><br>http:\/\/www.pewforum.org\/2015\/04\/02\/<wbr>religious-projections-2010-2050\/<br>http:\/\/www.pewforum.org\/2012\/12\/18\/<wbr>global-religious-landscape-unaffili<wbr>ated\/<br>http:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/news\/wor<wbr>ldnews\/asia\/china\/10776023\/China-on<wbr>-course-to-become-worlds-most-Chris<wbr>tian-nation-within-15-years.html<br>http:\/\/masterrussian.com\/russia\/fac<wbr>ts.htm","filename":"1490142549767","ext":".jpg","w":608,"h":755,"tn_w":201,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490437086537,"time":1490437086,"md5":"gbLQR\/M\/TdWWLU+dYjIA+Q==","fsize":123410,"resto":0,"id":"MpxPJwTX","country":"PL","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"atheism-is-the-fastest-shrinking-religion-in-the","country_name":"Poland","replies":9,"images":4,"unique_ips":9},{"no":118211157,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)06:19:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118211033\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118211033<\/a><br>a shame","time":1490437193,"resto":118211033,"id":"9g\/PmKr1","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118211267,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)06:21:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"hahhahhahhaa","filename":"1479513211200","ext":".jpg","w":269,"h":480,"tn_w":70,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490437302997,"time":1490437302,"md5":"txuQsOPhjpXSHweIf7lGFw==","fsize":31049,"resto":118211033,"id":"TwiitfBz","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":118211296,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)06:22:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118211033\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118211033<\/a><br>https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/news<wbr>\/acts-of-faith\/wp\/2016\/04\/21\/my-wif<wbr>e-and-i-are-white-evangelicals-here<wbr>s-why-we-chose-to-give-birth-to-bla<wbr>ck-triplets\/","time":1490437341,"resto":118211033,"id":"bI2d1hgD","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":118211410,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)06:23:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118211033\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118211033<\/a><br>yes of course. <br><br>Because like any other nature-denying mindset, atheists have no incentive or drive to reproduce because &quot;muh nihlism&quot;<br><br>theres a reason religion has and always will exist-barring some singluarity type shit","time":1490437439,"resto":118211033,"id":"0L32\/qW3","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118211525,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)06:25:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118211033\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118211033<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;atheists don&#039;t breed<\/span><br><br>What a surprise","filename":"IMG_2836","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":296,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":74,"tim":1490437547854,"time":1490437547,"md5":"eMrrQ7T5HcYdB0ciK7WPEA==","fsize":77445,"resto":118211033,"id":"vIsZ8mb4","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118211633,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)06:27:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118211525\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118211525<\/a><br>I think it&#039;s more because atheists realise that birth control is about as immoral as eating a chicken egg","time":1490437633,"resto":118211033,"id":"snd8nO+a","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118211668,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)06:27:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"Numbers don&#039;t matter if we have the strongest men on the planet on our side<br><br>What will 100 Christians do against 1 man who is trained in the way of the blade","filename":"5U6EBa7","ext":".jpg","w":557,"h":711,"tn_w":97,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490437660955,"time":1490437660,"md5":"npKRT344ez+5asTQbVFRkQ==","fsize":50986,"resto":118211033,"id":"OGDY1IRB","country":"CH","country_name":"Switzerland"},{"no":118211733,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)06:28:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118211633\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118211633<\/a><br><br>Pretty sure protestants use birth control and aren&#039;t breeding at below replacement levels, like atheicucks.","time":1490437719,"resto":118211033,"id":"vIsZ8mb4","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118211797,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)06:29:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"Atheists should be treated according to their non-belief: like animals.<br><br>A human with no appreciation for their higher cognitive function should not be treated as human per their &quot;belief&quot;.<br><br>All spiritual human see themselves as seperate from the animal kingdom, yet part of the same earth, but atheists don&#039;t. <br><br>It&#039;s time we dish a little good old pagan 10-fold justice out and make up for the millions of dead spiritualists who have died at the hands of these soulless commies.","filename":"1489782171158","ext":".jpg","w":569,"h":891,"tn_w":79,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490437776672,"time":1490437776,"md5":"ZW4JMV5dYJAQ7PZ0DttNFA==","fsize":100078,"resto":118211033,"id":"I\/0u7IaR","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

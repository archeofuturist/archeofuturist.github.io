They probably just believed the manufacturer&#039;s claims and rubber stamped the appropriation of the missiles and guidance system. The ships are staffed by officers based on favoritism. They are crewed by high school dropouts. This was an accurate assessment of the competence of a military designed to cost money and provide social welfare, not fight a war.<br><br>TLDR, it is exactly what it looks like.","filename":"13722158_1759397457683270_817797765_n[1]","ext":".jpg","w":480,"h":480,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491569900300,"time":1491569900,"md5":"dKfZgh4CpdV8kUc\/Q+gZxA==","fsize":34785,"resto":119932674,"id":"W4I+99oq","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119942485,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)08:59:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119942081\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119942081<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;US Navy TAOs now have Professor X capabilities where they hook themselves up to a Cerebro-like device to individually target planes with Sarin gas in them<\/span>","filename":"1367110599817","ext":".png","w":344,"h":278,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":101,"tim":1491569958023,"time":1491569958,"md5":"ooWSp5RIY5MSp9Wm1iSy5g==","fsize":112585,"resto":119932674,"id":"Y\/ZU9vr3","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119942512,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)08:59:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119942150\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119942150<\/a><br>and besides, i&#039;ll spell it out for you as to how it works: runways are designed to be compressed. that is their entire purpose. hitting a runway with an explosion from above will not do shit to the runway unless it is a VERY powerful one. to destroy a runway you have to either attack it from the side, or you have to puncture through it. a tomahawk can do neither.","time":1491569975,"resto":119932674,"id":"vpeaB7Cs","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":119942537,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)08:59:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119942258\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119942258<\/a><br><a href=\"#p119942255\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119942255<\/a><br>You stupid fuckers hadn&#039;t even seen pictures of the base.

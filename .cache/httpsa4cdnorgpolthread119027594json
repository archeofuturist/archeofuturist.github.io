In 1968, the Daily Pennsylvanian published a complete list of the 56 students who were on the Wharton Dean\u2019s List that year \u2013 and nowhere can Trump\u2019s name be found. That means, not only was Trump not first in his class, but he wasn\u2019t even anywhere near the top 15 percent.<br><br>Trump\u2019s transcripts have never been publicly released, it\u2019s not hard to verify this kind of information. Wharton graduate Stephen Foxman spoke with the DP and said that if Trump graduated with any honors he likely would have been mentioned in the 1968 Commencement Program. A copy of the program from the Penn Archives shows 20 Wharton award and prize recipients, 15 cum laude recipients, four magna cum laude recipients and two summa cum laude recipients for Trump\u2019s graduating year.

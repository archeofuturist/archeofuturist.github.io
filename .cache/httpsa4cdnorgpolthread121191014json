So simple rule: there are &quot;haves&quot; and &quot;have nots&quot;. Those who are &quot;haves&quot; have various privileges to participate in the system that emulates and mimics free market as powered by enormous computing power and those nobel prize winning algorithms of tar budgets laundering.

Not the most relevant ones but things you might find interesting anyway:<br>Most business owners are actually a lot dumber than they look, and the reason they succeed is that they just know the right people. Or perhaps it&#039;s not really that they&#039;re dumb, it&#039;s just that they know they don&#039;t need to be that smart. <br>Simple and predictable let you and everyone else focus on making money elsewhere. Of course there are exceptions, for example, Google reinvented the yellow pages; keep an eye on things like these if you can, especially if you are new, but also make sure you don&#039;t miss real opportunities because you&#039;re too busy reinventing something irrelevant.<br>Don&#039;t be afraid to take other peoples&#039; money and get into partnerships, but make sure they are good ones. The key to any successful partnership is that the partners make more money together than they would otherwise. Make sure you pull your own weight and you will be safe; but if you don&#039;t, don&#039;t rely on honesty or whatever keeping you in. Also don&#039;t obsess over details, whether you like your partners, how hard they work, etc. Just ask yourself, at the end of the year\/term\/whatever, will I have more or less money without him?<br>Personal relationships are extremely important, perhaps the most important thing of them all. You don&#039;t need to be objectively the best, if you know the right people. Or, rather, you are objectively the best if you&#039;re &#039;decent&#039;, and also a lot more trustworthy and easier to work with than some new hotshot who might represent a risk or require a lot of oversight. The time your business partners don&#039;t spend in you is time they spend making money elsewhere.","time":1492250025,"resto":121191014,"id":"2EXFfpzH","country":"UY","country_name":"Uruguay"},{"no":121195057,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)06:03:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"Make sure you get to know people, learn to talk, to make jokes, to drink and smoke, to dress, etcetera. Try to build some kind of deliberately shallow camaraderie with your business partners, something you can relate in. Sports, drinks, business, women, nerd stuff, whatever works. Don&#039;t go too deep and don&#039;t try to make it look like you want to go deep. I&#039;ve gone from death threats to laughing it off at a bar three hours later.<br>Consistency is very valued by people. It doesn&#039;t matter so much if you&#039;re smart, or good at what you do, if you&#039;ve been doing a thing for years, nonstop. Many business people don&#039;t want the best, they just want the most predictable, so they can invest their focus into something else. Of course if you are consistently good it can be great, but don&#039;t worry too much if you don&#039;t achieve that, especially at the beginning.<br>In the heat of the moment, people&#039;s attitude towards you is often based in their last interaction with you. It doesn&#039;t matter if you&#039;ve done perfectly for the last year, if you fuck up, they will think you&#039;re a moron until you get it right. Likewise, if you get it perfect, they will forget about the last ten times you fucked up.","time":1492250616,"resto":121191014,"id":"2EXFfpzH","country":"UY","country_name":"Uruguay"},{"no":121195418,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)06:08:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121191014\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121191014<\/a><br>Hire good people","time":1492250927,"resto":121191014,"id":"Ea17Vvhn","country":"PG","country_name":"Papua New Guinea"}]}

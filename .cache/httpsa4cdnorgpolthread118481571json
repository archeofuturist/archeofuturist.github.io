In fact, even before the Transportation Act of 1718 really opened the doors for Britain\u2019s dumping of undesirables in America, some colonies tried to pass laws that would prohibit the practice. In 1670 authorities in Virginia passed an act that prohibited convicts from being sent to the area. This, unsurprisingly, was overruled by the king.<br><br>Pennsylvania tried to do something similar in 1722 by passing a tax for the importation of any people for servitude who had been found \u201cguilty of heinous crimes.\u201d The king, naturally, said that this wasn\u2019t allowed either, proclaiming in 1731: \u201cWhereas acts have been passed in America for laying duties on felons imported, \u2014 in direct opposition to an act of Parliament for the more effectual transportation of felons, \u2014 it is our royal will and more pleasure that you approve of no duties laid on the importation of any felons into Pennsylvania.\u201d <br><br>Planters both in the West Indies and in Virginia, which was reckoned a part of them far on in the eighteenth century, needed laborers, and welcomed a supply from whatever quarter. As Virginia\u2019s staple was tobacco, it naturally became a centre of white as well as black servitude, whether its victims were indented or not, and criminal or not.<br><br>Americans have rather romantic ideas about how their country was founded. We\u2019ve long been fond of the mythology surrounding persecuted people freely traveling to the New World and building the greatest country on Earth. But, like all history, it\u2019s much, much messier than that.

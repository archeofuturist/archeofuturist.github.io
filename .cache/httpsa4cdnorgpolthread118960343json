He was studying to be a doctor. He changed his mission to save the world from the &quot;US menace&quot;. What really triggered him was something the US did in Mexico. When he did succeed in taking over Cuba he realized over time that it was hard for a country to be self-reliant and work hard on it&#039;s own. Trade was a necessity. Russia was the only one supporting Cuba&#039;s communism at the time so Che and Fidel worked with them, but reluctantly so. The Cuba he wanted was a Cuba without foreign intervention of any kind, yet a prosperous Cuba. Never really happened. He died fighting to liberate another country from the evil capitalists, the difference was the lay-people weren&#039;t into it and sold him out. He also tried to do something in Africa which was a failed mission.

I am unlikely to edit them tho. Simply because my PIL library does not support svg images. I am looking for a script only mechanism to produce this from a set of downloadables.<br><br>the real problem is working with a source of data that is consistent over time in terms of geographical extent, picture format, colour etc ( i am currently working against at least 50 rgb colour codes for 5 colours!) . <br><br>I currently convert all pictures to png ( because all the originals were png) , ensure they sit at a scale which has a height of 1000 pixels.

This gives me a proportional value from which all other values are calculated.<br><br>It&#039;s not a perfect measure. But it should be remembered that it is an imperfect set of data. However, in terms of measuring which colours occur in which proportions it is 100% accurate. However to assume that this translates to something meaningful on the ground would require one to assume that the map makers are honest ( even tho it is wikipedia - they are not honest, they post maps because they think it should &#039;look&#039; a certain way ) and always operating with the data thay have to hand. Additionally the calculation pretends that map projection etc are of no value whatsoever. Additional errors come from the fact that I do not even know what projection this map is - and resultantly I do not know if it is a good map projection for measuring area ( remember a map can show accurately 2 of three types of info (direction, area or distance), but not all three at the same time).<br><br>However, since it is intended to be cheaply reproduced, since it utilises free information, is easily updateable ( add a new image to the stack, rerun ) and runs without human intervention, it currently ticks all of the boxes that it was designed to tick.","time":1492193109,"resto":121079032,"id":"HMXkUwUk","country":"ZA","country_name":"South Africa"},{"no":121091048,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)14:05:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;faggot<\/span>","filename":"fag","ext":".png","w":358,"h":317,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":110,"tim":1492193124497,"time":1492193124,"md5":"LzkRRYZSsLGMK6AF+tsSwA==","fsize":79165,"resto":121079032,"id":"EGvYs8YX","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":121091162,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)14:06:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121091048\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121091048<\/a><br><br>Is says the same thing in Arabic?

Most of that private rail is barely class II (60mph max, IIRC). So its shitty, slow and bumpy forever because freight doesn&#039;t need to travel comfortably.<br><br>* The Superliner I series was built in the &#039;70s. They are still in service. Superliner IIs in the &#039;90s, and most of those are still around, too. The only new addition to this rolling stock are new A\/C units (&quot;new&quot; as in &quot;replacement&quot;) and WiFi hotspots.<br><br>* Freight services still receive subsidies for allowing Amtrak to use their lines, even though this is mandatory wherever deemed such. Private dispatchers are instructed to give Amtrak services the lowest priority under all circumstances.<br><br>* It looks like their going back to their &quot;Phase III&quot; scheme - broad Red-White &amp; Blue.<br><br>I had more, but I&#039;m not sufficiently coherent to bother.","time":1491297777,"resto":119441628,"id":"7jzAtQJS","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119451906,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)05:26:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119451324\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119451324<\/a><br><br>Amtrak was really just created to absorb all the suddenly unprofitable passenger equipment.<br><br>It remained because there is probably just as much paperwork involved in dismantling it (and justifying the sudden &quot;loss&quot; in the form of stagnating, nearly-worthless assets) as compared to maintaining it as a way to funnel a modest amount of money into private freight services.","time":1491297970,"resto":119441628,"id":"7jzAtQJS","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119452260,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)05:31:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119451324\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119451324<\/a><br>Yes.<br><br>The US (particularly the west) is more rugged than Europe too.

About a super vampire and that guy trying to take over the world and a really old jew trying to stop them. That guy is an immortal Nazi vampire. The show takes place in modern times but the scene in the image is from before he was a vampire, he had just became an SS officer and while on patrol he saw his ex girlfriend hanging, she was Jewish and they split because of their differing ideologies. At first he was shocked at what he saw, but before he was an SS officer he was a low life nothing and now he&#039;s top dog in his neighborhood, so he lights the cigarette visibly shaken as he looks at somebody who he once regarded as the love of his life hanging from a tree. But by the time he&#039;s done with it he&#039;s likely concluded he chose the right side and made the best decisions for himself, so that is why he is smiling. <br><br>is gud show&quot;","time":1493126078,"resto":122724200,"id":"+7K81O4D","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"}]}

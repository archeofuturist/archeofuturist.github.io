It is like summoning a Titan or Archon on the astral plane. Corrupted and out of your control, it just wants to devour, it only knows it own hunger. Unless it is somehow &#039;tamed&#039; or brought to heel it will just do its thing. It has long periods of rest, or at least dwelling in one place, we&#039;ve noticed, before it moves again. &#039;They&#039; (the ones who called it) think they control it, but that is because their own desires are just as foul.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Deny it, refute it, try to smash it out of the existence of your mind and you are just giving it room to thrive. It wants to be in the darkness, out of sight and unknown. It is a hunter, a predator. However it is the embodiment of that which is repressed in the collective unconsciousness of all of humanity and which has been purposely suppressed for the express purpose of feeding it in to the calling of this entity. They believe they are doing it for the greater good but their good is twisted and full of pain. It is darkness fed by darkness.<\/span><br><br>1. This is wrong, we never wanted to control kek. We are happy he does what he does and are glad to be able to witness him.<br><br>2. What he explains is exactly why we like kek.<br><br>3. Praise kek, let the chaos flow, let destruction reign.","filename":"1486045120114","ext":".jpg","w":512,"h":512,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490788365559,"time":1490788365,"md5":"4m9nJ1NiErNu+m8biEKkdQ==","fsize":40414,"resto":118777303,"id":"NWFqdx\/m","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"}]}

I went to college for roughly two years, learned a trade, and you would think with my education on top of my experience working in the field I would get better offers, but almost all of them so far have been low ball minimum wage offers with little to no growing room in the company, basically dead end jobs. <br> <br>This one job offer however was my final straw and I don&#039;t know whether to keep looking or what. I go to school with this guy who is in my shop math class, and he works at this machine shop, he also immigrated from Iran maybe less than a year. I would say it&#039;s a pretty big company that he works for, and he offered me a position in it, told me to send him my resume and then he forwarded it to HR. So I get a call from their HR, who btw was speaking in broken English and I could barely understand her, she sets up an interview the next day (which was yesterday) <br> <br>I go there and ask for Maria, she gives me a tour around the place, a lot of people there looked like your average new comer to USA, didn&#039;t know English too well,, at this point I already know my decision, 9 times out of 10&#039;s if you see new comers from another country, it&#039;s time to go. She then tells me that they would start me out at minimum wage like they do everyone, I frankly right then and there told her I will think about it and left, I&#039;m not even going to call her back. <br> <br>The rumors are fucking true, and this was at a machine shop, if they are hiring cheap labor to run their machines and check out parts, then we&#039;re fucked, these parts have tenths of cleanings and they are paying them minimum wage to work there, unbelievable. Why the fuck am I going to work for minimum wage when I can deliver pizzas all day and make virtually the same, because it gives me the opportunity to work in machining with a &quot;chance&quot; one day to move up, when your own current workers aren&#039;t?

In comparison to other high-developed economies, the United States import close to nothing. Due to being surrounded by oceans, the US economy is historically isolated. The trade deficit of the US stems from the overvaluation of its (petro-)dollar and contributes little to the overall economic situation. <br><br>The general perception that America is declining is false as well. \u201cMake America great again\u201d? It was never greater than today. Between 1980 and 2017, industrial output doubled. Private household wealth grew fivefold. The Dow Jones Index by a factor of 16. Even adjusted for the inflation, which was far lower during the 1980-2017 period than in the 1970s, these numbers are impressive: total US household wealth stands at $90.2 trillion \u2013 almost one in every third dollar in the World belongs to an American. <br><br>The distribution of this added wealth is another story. And, arguably, the reason why the US middle class feels threatened. Half of the US has close to no wealth. The top 1% own half of it. Even China, Mexico and Indonesia perform better in this regard. And this is what actually worsened between the 1980s and today: while top 1% household incomes tripled, median wages mostly stagnated.

Why are negative economic indicators, such as social mobility, debt deflation, credit defaults, actual unemployment, inequality, wage-to-capital ratio as alarming as right before the Great Depression? <br><br>Popular left-wing arguments blame the following: the decline of unionization (from 35% to below 10% today), NAFTA and the WTO membership of China, skyrocketing CEO compensation, the financialization of the housing and education markets, H-1B visa abuse, changed management culture, a minimum wage that doesn\u2019t keep up with inflation, irregular employment schemes, reduced top income tax and capital tax brackets, capital market globalization, the increasing role of lobbies and big money in politics, be it Democrats or Republicans. These trends may be summarized as \u201cneoliberalism\u201d, the Reagan-Thatcher free market, state rollback revolution that happened in the 1980s, displacing the egalitarian \u201cNew Deal\u201d and \u201cGreat Society\u201d programs in the US. Similar market-liberal trends occurred in Germany (Agenda 2010), the United Kingdom (New Labour), France (tournant de la rigueur), Japan (Abenomics) and, obviously, on the whole Post-Soviet territory. <br><br>More sophisticated explanations, demanding economic knowledge to comprehend, include: automation, which, for the first time ever, is proven to lead to technical unemployment in certain sectors \u2013 while industrial output in the US keeps growing, factories employ less actual people. Finance drowned private households, banks and governments in debt, leading to a decline in real investment. Finally, the abandonment of the post-war Keynesianism (1949-1979) might provide \u201cthe hint of the century\u201d to why 1979 was such a breaking point for wage growth. Wage stagnation, in turn, led to \u201csecular stagnation\u201d of the whole economy.","time":1492015394,"resto":120768253,"id":"6VoLLQJm","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":120776001,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)12:44:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120775557\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120775557<\/a><br>Absolute<br>G O A T","time":1492015443,"resto":120768253,"id":"lxixjfQF","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120776070,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)12:44:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120775233\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120775233<\/a><br>Or maybe we will be living in virtual reality, so automatisation won&#039;t really hurt us.

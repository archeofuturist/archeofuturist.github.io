The main reason we do coffee more in this day and age is because of the conveince, big carafes can be filled just as your waking up due to most modern coffee makers have timers, even with that it doesn&#039;t take long for it to brew anyways. I think most American find to too laborious to heat the water in a sperate kettle and move it to pour it over the tea leaves and then let it steep for the required amount of time. In general we&#039;d rather just pour boiling water over grounds and let the juice pass through a filter because it seems easier.","time":1493643179,"resto":123613260,"id":"5EEd4FRg","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123617380,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)08:53:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123613260\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123613260<\/a><br>The flavor isn&#039;t strong enough for me, to me it ends up tasting like it was some other beverage that was then watered down.<br><br>One time I brewed three times the suggested amount of tea mix in some milk and chilled it and it was alright.

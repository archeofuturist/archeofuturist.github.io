If we send back the people who try and cross, they&#039;ll sell others they got sent back and they wasted their money. This means people stop bothering to go as they don&#039;t want to lose their money. The public think these people are starving poor women and children where the vast majority are working age men. Anybody who comes to Europe through a ship is literally paying to jump the queue. Those applying for asylum or refuge through official channels are left to wait, while people bung \u00a3500 to a criminal to get them across. We should be sending them back. This is just destabilising dozens of countries based on criminal lies that this is the land of Milk and Honey. It isn&#039;t. We&#039;re full.

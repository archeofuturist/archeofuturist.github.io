There&#039;s a massive difference between mass migration and the picture you show one example is that mass migration can destabilize otherwise stable nations. Another is ethnic displacement. <br><br>There&#039;s no net positive for a stable nation letting in hordes of people from somewhere else who bring a very different attitude and behaviour with them.

The tribe has a leader who operates on it just like the state government operates in your example. And the point of the thread is that the globalist elite today are no different from the kings in the past or the white man who colonized the tribes in unsettled lands like those of the aborigines. It&#039;s just a spectrum of the same thing. What nationalists are fighting for isn&#039;t really so much the concept of nations in general as it is the supremacy of their own tribe. Even if progress is going towards oneness, you can&#039;t really strive for it, because it would be the same as just lying down to die.

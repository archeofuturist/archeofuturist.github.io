Hosea 4:6<br><br>\u201cSymbolism is the language of the Mysteries; in fact it is the language not only of mysticism and philosophy but of all Nature, for every law and power active in universal procedure is manifested to the limited sense perceptions of man through the medium of symbol. Every form existing in the diversified sphere of being is symbolic of the divine activity by which it is produced. By symbols men have ever sought to communicate to each other those thoughts which transcend the limitations of language. Rejecting man-conceived dialects as inadequate and unworthy to perpetuate divine ideas, the Mysteries thus chose symbolism as a far more ingenious and ideal method of preserving their transcendental knowledge. In a single figure a symbol may both reveal and conceal, for to the wise the subject of the symbol is obvious, while to the ignorant the figure remains inscrutable. Hence, he who seeks to unveil the secret doctrine of antiquity must search for that doctrine not upon the open pages of books which might fall into the hands of the unworthy but in the place where it was originally concealed.\u201d \u2014 Manly P. Hall, The Secret Teachings of All Ages, p. 38","filename":"monster_energy","ext":".jpg","w":800,"h":450,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1492354194706,"time":1492354194,"md5":"ELjxVg2n23c\/hjiCHe0nvA==","fsize":85469,"resto":121358849,"id":"ohK6ELDT","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121365725,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)10:51:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121365155\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121365155<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;they&#039;re full of sugar<\/span><br><br>That&#039;s where you are wrong m8.<br><br>All sips are sugar free","filename":"1480222807352","ext":".jpg","w":351,"h":354,"tn_w":123,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492354299553,"time":1492354299,"md5":"6HdqXQ9fQFyY\/shx0reKHg==","fsize":13970,"resto":121358849,"id":"Y4Tc3Bgj","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":121365818,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)10:52:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121365518\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121365518<\/a><br>the beast thing is intentional and for marketing purposes","time":1492354351,"resto":121358849,"id":"gWopnvO5","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":121365930,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)10:53:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121358849\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121358849<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;http:\/\/www.threeworldwars.com\/worl<wbr>d-war-3\/ww3.htm<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Bulgarian not drinking Rakia<\/span><br>Fuck off to Germany where the cucks are.","time":1492354413,"resto":121358849,"id":"2ibOSiDs","country":"SI","country_name":"Slovenia"},{"no":121365988,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)10:54:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121365725\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121365725<\/a><br>And they taste like shit.<br>Sugar free energy drinks are the absolute worst.

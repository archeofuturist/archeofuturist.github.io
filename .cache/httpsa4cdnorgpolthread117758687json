WWII becomes more of a grey area the more and more I read into it.<br>Typically when asked about the Axis power in Europe, the first thing that usually pops in people&#039;s minds is the blonde haired blue-eyed Aryan Soldier that Nazi Germany is well known to be portrayed for. However as I dig and dig, i&#039;m finding overlooked and missed history. Nazi Germany did have non-whites in their military contrary to popular beliefs. However, i&#039;m still reading about how it was like growing up under Nazi occupation.<br>Yes, the Jews were still being persecuted and sent to the camps. But reading on history, Hitler and the party didn&#039;t have any real rules in set for visible minorities such as arabs, blacks, etc due to the population being relatively small. Apparently the Nazis had a Arab foreign legion during the North African campaign that actively tried to recruit the natives. India was fighting against British rule from what I heard so allying with the Axis was rather easy. Then of course the Asian population in the German ranks as well.<br>This is from reading the internet last night. I really want to find out more about this.","filename":"17426059_1281028111932862_2941991694417327014_n","ext":".jpg","w":838,"h":515,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":153,"tim":1490189894880,"time":1490189894,"md5":"LU7hJJ66b8cLYD3b8b7Yxw==","fsize":117619,"resto":0,"id":"fMdW5SkZ","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"its-weird-wwii-becomes-more-of-a-grey-area-the","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":117759009,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)09:42:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"Bump for interest.","time":1490190154,"resto":117758687,"id":"V2tozhwP","country":"EC","country_name":"Ecuador"}]}

In fact, in a democratic republic such as ours, the government should not have so much control over your life that a presidrnt only in office for a minimum if 4 years and max of 8 years should be able to impact the daily lives of citizens so much that functioning is imposdible depending on who is in power. Government is there to protect our civil liberties as in the constitution, protect its citizens and make laws that enhance the USA&#039;s prosperity. A government large enough to give you everything is also fully capable of taking it all away.","time":1491277419,"resto":119424796,"id":"EJMZ8Nok","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119426402,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)23:45:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119425076\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119425076<\/a><br>Property owners<br><br>But first fix the courts so women aren&#039;t compelled to take your shit.","time":1491277554,"resto":119424796,"id":"inZoxPm9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

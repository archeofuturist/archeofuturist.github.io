China accounts for about 90 percent of the North\u2019s trade and is a major supplier of oil for the country. But in the eyes of Washington, China has been reluctant to use its economic leverage forcibly enough to stop the North\u2019s growing nuclear and missile threats.","filename":"13395_northkorea1f","ext":".jpg","w":1000,"h":667,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1491380701869,"time":1491380701,"md5":"1limGeEg2Q7C9isR1Aj2Ag==","fsize":383040,"resto":0,"id":"inHjxT1g","country":"AU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"north-korea-missile-test","country_name":"Australia","replies":5,"images":1,"unique_ips":4},{"no":119585336,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)04:36:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;We have no further comment<\/span><br>Sounds serious.","filename":"North Korea Launches Another Ballistic Missile Into Waters Near Japan The Two Way NPR","ext":".png","w":580,"h":149,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":32,"tim":1491381373197,"time":1491381373,"md5":"kpfv4VCqQ54ZWmigVcdFuA==","fsize":12558,"resto":119584685,"id":"SAfnm2M6","country":"JP","country_name":"Japan"},{"no":119585407,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)04:37:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119585336\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119585336<\/a><br>Last time i checked weren&#039;t they lobbing one over your country?","time":1491381437,"resto":119584685,"id":"inHjxT1g","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":119586211,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)04:50:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119585407\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119585407<\/a><br>The one on March 6 didn&#039;t fly over my country but it was close.<br>One of their Scud ERs landed within 200km from japan.","time":1491382255,"resto":119584685,"id":"SAfnm2M6","country":"JP","country_name":"Japan"},{"no":119587049,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)05:04:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"If there&#039;s another Korean war would the the UK be involved too?","time":1491383048,"resto":119584685,"id":"i5ZYikOf","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119588327,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)05:23:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119587049\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119587049<\/a><br>Think u have bigger problems like Spain and germistan to worry about","time":1491384228,"resto":119584685,"id":"k1TEqlr4","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

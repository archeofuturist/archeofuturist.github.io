The greatest philosopher of all time, nobody would dare attempt to argue with him, none in a trillion universes could ever hold a candle to this beautiful and wonderful man&#039;s mind and perception. Every sound that he has ever uttered was the divine incarnate, pouring the waters of wisdom upon the blessed and fortunate ears to hear them. The sun itself is dim whne compared to the light of his mind, the blackness of the void is nothing to the despair and darkness he has seen when contemplating man and his actions and purpose. All the planets ever are but a dot in the expanse of his knowledge, all the great men of history and their achievements are dwarfed by a single sentence of his. All of the art, music, cinema, and all other creative expressions seem a child&#039;s pottery when compared with his speaking. His voice, more beautiful than any Beethoven, Led Zeppelin, more profound than Pink Floyd, Tchaivosky, Mozart, more complex than Dream Theater, Paganini, or DRAGONFORCE. His titles and prestige outnumber the stars, even the atoms of the multiverse, he is knowm everywhere as the greatest mind ever created, some believe he created himself before God roamed the void even. <br><br>I speak of course, and shame on you if you havent guessed, of the mighty, the legendary, the beautiful, the courageous, the exalted...<br><br>Jayden Smith.","time":1492710289,"resto":122015785,"id":"HvtyO6sq","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122019300,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)13:47:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122019002\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122019002<\/a><br><br>Adderall is a hell of a drug <br><br>I&#039;ve been meaning to fake symptoms of adhd to get a prescription, any tips?","time":1492710466,"resto":122015785,"id":"xbf1rUoE","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122019553,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)13:50:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122019300\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122019300<\/a><br>Im on opioids actually, I wish I had some addies my dude.

A president gets political capitol for the first year to do several big ticket items. Trump have barely used any political capitol. Do not confuse ultra butthurt Dems going on TV and crying as using political capitol. Tax reform needs very few Democrats (practically zero) to join in and practically every Republican is onboard.<br><br>Second, Ryancare was a fix to Obamacare and would have cost months and tons of political capitol that can now be focused on tax reform which the Republican base and business is dieing for. Obamacare has to either be completely repealed or let collapse for Trump and Republicans to be able to avoid being involved with the toxic cancer that is Obamacare.<br><br>Third, Can you be more butthurt?","time":1490411429,"resto":118173756,"id":"Slz\/jtw2","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118177472,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)23:10:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118177107\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118177107<\/a><br>His sarcastic point was garbage and added nothing to the conversation just like shitty post.

A president gets political capitol for the first year to do several big ticket items. Trump have barely used any political capitol. Do not confuse ultra butthurt Dems going on TV and crying as using political capitol. Tax reform needs very few Democrats (practically zero) to join in and practically every Republican is onboard.<br><br>Second, Ryancare was a fix to Obamacare and would have cost months and tons of political capitol that can now be focused on tax reform which the Republican base and business is dieing for. Obamacare has to either be completely repealed or let collapse for Trump and Republicans to be able to avoid being involved with the toxic cancer that is Obamacare.<br><br>Third, Can you be more butthurt?","time":1490411429,"resto":118173756,"id":"Slz\/jtw2","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118177472,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)23:10:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118177107\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118177107<\/a><br>His sarcastic point was garbage and added nothing to the conversation just like shitty post.

As much as people like to talk shit on ObamaCare no-one wants to go back to the days when your insurance could take your premiums for 20 years then dump you when you get cancer and start costing them too much money. Trump thought it was just going to work itself out and it&#039;s easy to say something you don&#039;t really give a shit about. When he actually started paying attention he realized it was going to fail. That&#039;s why he played the background for the most part and let Ryan shit the bed. In all reality for all the shit he talked Trump doesn&#039;t have a plan to defeat ISIS, make healthcare awesome, or make the economy better for anyone who isn&#039;t middle class or better already. If this bill would have passed people would have been up in arms. Trump would rather just never have to hear about healthcare again ever, of course that puts the Republicans in the Senate and House on thin ice as their act of sending repeal of Obama care to the president&#039;s desk at every opportunity is now exposed unless they press on. Should be interesting. Of course he just repealed the ACA mandate via executive order, so now ObamaCare is doomed to fail as that will send rates explosively high since insurance now has all the restrictions of ObamaCare and people don&#039;t actually have to get it until they get sick. So you can literally wait until you get cancer before you get insurance and they can&#039;t deny you. Basically Trump just fucked up healthcare knowing he wouldn&#039;t unfuck it so he can blame Obama in a year or two when no one can afford insurance anymore.","time":1490413754,"resto":118173756,"id":"JVEb5tlM","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118181432,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)23:49:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118174987\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118174987<\/a><br>i cant see whats going on here. can i get a quick rundown?","time":1490413755,"resto":118173756,"id":"go7XfmDL","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118181486,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)23:49:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118180471\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118180471<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;you dogs<\/span><br>thanks for posting you filthy muslim\/arab. no civilized person of european decent uses these the flacid swear word &#039;dog&#039;","time":1490413791,"resto":118173756,"id":"LQTVVWrI","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":118181520,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)23:50:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118180913\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118180913<\/a><br>Obamacare was the best the democrats could pass since Ted Kennedy died and Scott Brown took his seat, so they lost their 60 vote filibuster proof majority in the Senate before its passage.

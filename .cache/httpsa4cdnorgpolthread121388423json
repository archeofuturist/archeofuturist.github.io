There is actually a religious background to the choice of date (as the shortest day in the year) and it was ironically the Romans who edged it in that direction, particularly under Augustine.<br>There WAS another Roman pagan festival on the same day called Sol Invictus, but we don&#039;t really know much about it, and the scholarly opinion to date is that they were wholly unrelated and that in fact Christmas already predated Sol Invictus by quite a long time:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;One such late, and obviously hostile, source has little value in this case. I would argue that the evidence is clear. In the Roman Empire, the divine nature of Sol was open to broad interpretation. As a heavenly body, the sun was often used - together with Luna - as a cosmicsymbol or metaphor for eternity. The astronomical reality of the sun and the moon precluded such symbolism from being exclusively pagan, and the evidence of the De solstitia et aequinoctia conceptionis et nativitatis domini nostri iesu christi et iohannis baptistae, as well as the passages of a wide range of homilies collected by Heim (1999) suggest that it was readily adopted by Christians.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;It is cosmic symbolism of this type which inspired the Church leadership in Rome to elect the winter solstice, December 25, as the birthday of Christ, and the summer solstice as that of John the Baptist, supplemented by the equinoxes as their respective dates of conception.

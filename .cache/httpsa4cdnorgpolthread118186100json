Your insights are much appreciated, as always. And btw this paper is for a business program and the prof. is not SJW (best described as a typical boomer cuckservative) so topics such as immigration and backwards weedman economic policies are fair game... basically any issue short of &#039;le chosen people.&#039;<br>Any graphs and charts would also be much appreciated. The paper is fairly open-ended, with the choice of writing about global business in general, a particular sector, or an individual company. News stories are acceptable sources so long as they are from (((reputable outlets))) company and balanced with enough peer-reviewed articles\/journals to go along with them.<br>On top of writing a solid paper, any subtle red pills that can be thrown in would be for the greater good as this prof is a reachable enough mind.","filename":"tmp_6676-1490395203924m-607523406","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":812,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":198,"tim":1490416623652,"time":1490416623,"md5":"8s8DPGAepitrItUtvNyZoQ==","fsize":97841,"resto":0,"id":"wJPjkx2p","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"requesting-academic-assistance","country_name":"Canada","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":1},{"no":118187665,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)00:53:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"Shameless self bump.","time":1490417608,"resto":118186100,"id":"wJPjkx2p","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]}

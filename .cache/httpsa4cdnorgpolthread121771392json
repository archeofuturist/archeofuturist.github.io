Subsidizing one company in an industry is hostile to all other companies in that industry. If you enter a subsidized industry and you don&#039;t fight for your fair share, you&#039;re getting screwed. It&#039;s like claiming all of your tax deductions.<br><br>You have to recognize when you go into business, that the government is taxing your employees, so they need more pay, and it&#039;s taxing your customers, so they don&#039;t have as much to spend, and it&#039;s going to tax you when you turn a profit, reducing your ability to reinvest and making the whole thing less worthwhile for you.<br><br>Fighting for subsidies and organizing your affairs to minimize tax burden are awful, disgusting parts of business, which are totally unproductive, incredibly frustrating if you want to do anything real, and completely non-optional if you want to compete and survive.<br><br>In a better world, there would be less tax and no subsidies. We&#039;re not living in that better world.","time":1492574257,"resto":121771392,"id":"ZPv5asxA","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121797836,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)23:59:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121775265\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121775265<\/a><br>I know the pain","time":1492574380,"resto":121771392,"id":"MLkao9QE","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121797967,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)00:00:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121771392\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121771392<\/a><br>Quick reminder that Elon Musk is a media meme.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;electric cars will never be more successful that gasoline cars<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;spaceX is not profitable within the next 300 years (inb4 spacemining)<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;paypal is yet another bank<\/span><br><br>He literally created nothing of value.","filename":"chink","ext":".jpg","w":400,"h":396,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":123,"tim":1492574435758,"time":1492574435,"md5":"Rw9E2Sa5pSEZkuP+fIz5kA==","fsize":34559,"resto":121771392,"id":"e9HnTLVG","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":121797971,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)00:00:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121771392\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121771392<\/a><br>Those dead eyes.

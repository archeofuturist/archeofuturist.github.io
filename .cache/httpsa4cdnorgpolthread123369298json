She gave the order to blow up The Belgrano even though it was outside of the Malvinas Exclusion Zone\u2014and was sailing AWAY from the islands! When the young Argentinean boys aboard The Belgrano had suffered a most appalling and unjust death, Thatcher gave the thumbs-up sign for the British press. <br><br>Thatcher will only be fondly remembered by sentimentalists who did not suffer under her leadership, but the majority of British working people have forgotten her already, and the people of Argentina will be celebrating her death. As a matter of recorded fact, Thatcher was a terror without an atom of humanity.","filename":"MorrisseyHB30611-2","ext":".jpg","w":900,"h":600,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1493494372356,"time":1493494372,"md5":"OXiA3+vyFWY4YL552PKFag==","fsize":67477,"resto":123369298,"id":"XpLzJMj2","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":123370942,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)15:37:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123370334\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123370334<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;t. moved from Argentina<\/span>","filename":"Flag_of_the_Falkland_Islands.svg","ext":".png","w":1200,"h":600,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":62,"tim":1493494668966,"time":1493494668,"md5":"Gqo\/Fzb8mcGjKWSOfAxSfg==","fsize":106885,"resto":123369298,"id":"UjfC7sg7","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123371180,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)15:39:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"We need another Thatcher.

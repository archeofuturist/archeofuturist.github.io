There was this one old woman who would literally jog laps around the sanctuary and sometimes swat people in the front rows with flowers. There was no decoration as you&#039;d see in a Catholic or maybe Presbyterian church. It was kind of like a huge gymnasium with a stage and baptismal tub.

If a brother or sister is naked and destitute of daily food, and one of you says to them, \u201cDepart in peace, be warmed and filled,\u201d but you do not give them the things which are needed for the body, what does it profit? Thus also faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead.

Even the demons believe\u2014and tremble! But do you want to know, O foolish man, that faith without works is dead? Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he offered Isaac his son on the altar? Do you see that faith was working together with his works, and by works faith was made perfect? And the Scripture was fulfilled which says, \u201cAbraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness.\u201d And he was called the friend of God. You see then that a man is justified by works, and not by faith only. Likewise, was not Rahab the harlot also justified by works when she received the messengers and sent them out another way? For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.&quot; Do you not understand?

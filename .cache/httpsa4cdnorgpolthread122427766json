One of the more well-known tales allegedly occurred 13 years after the disappearance of Sugarfoot Jack. A constable Ryan, who was stationed in nearby Cooktown, tracked a fugitive to Black Mountain along with other trackers only for the trail to abruptly end at the mouth of one of the caves as if the criminal had just stepped off the face of the earth. Ryan entered the cave to see if the fugitive might be hiding inside, but according to those present he never came back out and no one else was willing to risk going in after him. Neither the criminal nor constable Ryan was ever seen again. In another case, a local man by the name of Harry Owens was out looking for stray cattle and when he did not return his partner, George Hawkins, informed the police and went out looking for him. When Hawkins did not return either, the police launched a search of the mountain for the two missing men. According to the account, two police officers ventured into one of the caves and only one of them emerged. When the lone officer came out from the darkness, he was reportedly completely unhinged and so terrified of whatever he had seen that he could not give a coherent report of what had happened. In the 1920s, two professional cave explorers who journeyed to the mountain to try and solve the enigma of these disappearances went missing themselves, as well as some trackers who went looking for them. More recently, in 1932, a backpacker named Harry Page went missing while hiking on Black Mountain and was later found dead from unknown causes. The list goes on.<\/span>","time":1492965319,"resto":122427766,"id":"HaFqDhJJ","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":122444704,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)12:35:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122444233\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122444233<\/a><br>spooky","time":1492965338,"resto":122427766,"id":"fxGHi26\/","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122444775,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)12:36:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122432736\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122432736<\/a><br>*eastern europe","time":1492965371,"resto":122427766,"id":"7+tDx5t8","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":122444868,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)12:36:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122443166\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122443166<\/a><br>checked","filename":"Altai","ext":".png","w":642,"h":325,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":63,"tim":1492965416205,"time":1492965416,"md5":"W5uDF8ValQ7baokbrIi1pQ==","fsize":593054,"resto":122427766,"id":"pL7+BMRG","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":122444881,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)12:37:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122444704\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122444704<\/a><br>yea, i kinda want to go but i&#039;m scared desu.<br><br>govt won&#039;t let you camp overnight btw, <br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Black<wbr>_Mountain_(Kalkajaka)_National_Park<wbr><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Camping is not permitted in the park.

Suddenly I found myself facing a solid wall of rock, but to the right there was a passageway just large enough for me to enter in a stooping position. I moved along it carefully for several yards. The floor was fairly level, the walls of very smooth granite. The passage twisted and turned this way and that, always sloping deeper into the earth. Presently I began to feel uneasy. A huge bat beat its wings against me as it passed, however I forced myself on, to push further. Soon my nostrils were filled with a sickly musty stench. Then my torch went out. I was in total darkness. From somewhere, that seemed the bowels of the earth I could hear a faint moaning which was then followed by the flapping of wings of thousands of bats. I began to panic as I groped and floundered back the way I thought I had come. My arms and legs were bleeding from bumps with unseen rocks. My outstretched hands clawed at space, I expected solid walls and floors, but could not find it. At one stage where I had wandered into a side passage, I came to the brink of what was undoubtedly a precipice-judging by the echoes. The air was foul and I felt increasing dizziness. Terrifying thoughts were racing through my mind about giant rock-pythons I have seen around this mountain. As I crawled along, getting weaker and loosing hope of ever coming out alive, I saw a tiny streak of light. It gave me super strength to worm my way towards a small cave mouth half a mile from the one I had entered. Reaching the open air I gulped in lungfuls of it and fell down exhausted. I later found that I had been underground for five hours, most of the time on my hands and knees. A King\u2019s ransom would not induce me to enter those caves again.<\/span>","time":1492965718,"resto":122427766,"id":"HaFqDhJJ","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":122445468,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)12:42:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122445281\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122445281<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;white bored while bored.<\/span><br><br>*while bored<br>Why can&#039;t I fucking type today.","time":1492965721,"resto":122427766,"id":"hmwBd7HC","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122445557,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)12:42:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122432736\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122432736<\/a><br><br>Is this what slavs really think?","time":1492965765,"resto":122427766,"id":"e+sd40cA","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122445565,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)12:42:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122445282\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122445282<\/a><br><br>If anything left in this world, its mysteries like these.","filename":"15591598_434684820253953_1422393554016198590_o","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":800,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":97,"tim":1492965768812,"time":1492965768,"md5":"Qi9HWJERymARqlDmoAi91Q==","fsize":262228,"resto":122427766,"id":"uwVfG+DE","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":122445577,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)12:42:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122445021\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122445021<\/a><br>What does this mean?

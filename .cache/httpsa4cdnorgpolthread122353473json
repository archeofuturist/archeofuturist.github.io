Bernie Sanders supports Ann Coulter&#039;s right to speak at the University of California-Berkeley, and told The Huffington Post that attempts to shut her down are a &quot;sign of intellectual weakness&quot; amongst some of her critics.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Sanders made clear that he is no fan of Coulter, but nevertheless believes students who want to hear speak deserve that opportunity.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;Obviously Ann Coulter&#039;s outrageous \u2015 to my mind, off the wall,&quot; said Sanders. &quot;But you know, people have a right to give their two cents-worth, give a speech, without fear of violence and intimidation.&quot;<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Berkeley administrators recently cancelled Coulter&#039;s upcoming visit because they could not guarantee her safety. Protesters had threatened violence and rioting if Coulter should appear.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;But giving into the protesters means succumbing to the heckler&#039;s veto\u2014it commits the university to censoring anyone whose views displease the mob. Berkeley, thankfully, has reconsidered, and Coulter will be giving a talk.<\/span>","filename":"Sandersspeech","ext":".jpg","w":428,"h":321,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1492908070554,"time":1492908070,"md5":"2K6eXxpKFuxF42rmz2\/UPg==","fsize":80586,"resto":0,"id":"4bmkpCHk","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"bernie-sanders-says-ann-coulter-has-right-to","country_name":"United States","replies":4,"images":1,"unique_ips":5},{"no":122353539,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)20:41:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122353473\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122353473<\/a><br>wtf I love bernie sanders now","time":1492908101,"resto":122353473,"id":"5lYkRyuK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122353767,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)20:43:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"daily reminder that politics is a waste of time and energy.<br>Do your selfs a favor a stop caring about this nonsense.","time":1492908210,"resto":122353473,"id":"EF2+mvV6","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122353827,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)20:44:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"So brave<br><br>A liberal defending free speech","time":1492908243,"resto":122353473,"id":"XLGeVljv","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122353913,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)20:44:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"yfw its getting so bad lord cuck has to step in and say they are actting to much like cucks<br><br>what a timeline glad i came over","filename":"1133461","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":375,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1492908292330,"time":1492908292,"md5":"vEiihIDOi\/awU6NjzYMelg==","fsize":56060,"resto":122353473,"id":"h+UjJZ+T","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

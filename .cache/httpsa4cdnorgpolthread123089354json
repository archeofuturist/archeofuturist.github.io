The Soviet authorities were well aware of this dependency on Lend-Lease.

First, I would like to tell about some remarks Stalin made and repeated several times when we were \u201cdiscussing freely\u201d among ourselves. He stated bluntly that if the United States had not helped us, we would not have won the war. If we had had to fight Nazi Germany one on one, we could not have stood up against Germany\u2019s pressure, and we would have lost the war. No one ever discussed this subject officially, and I don\u2019t think Stalin left any written evidence of his opinion, but I will state here that several times in conversations with me he noted that these were the actual circumstances. He never made a special point of holding a conversation on the subject, but when we were engaged in some kind of relaxed conversation, going over international questions of the past and present, and when we would return to the subject of the path we had traveled during the war, that is what he said. When I listened to his remarks, I was fully in agreement with him, and today I am even more so.[30]<\/span><br><br><a href=\"#p123104610\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123104610<\/a><br><a href=\"#p123104610\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123104610<\/a><br><a href=\"#p123104610\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123104610<\/a>","filename":"1477600990211","ext":".jpg","w":1190,"h":906,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":95,"tim":1493333999164,"time":1493333999,"md5":"+Xyfsp1sICWnjlsQNq8FfQ==","fsize":315009,"resto":123089354,"id":"AOHrKB3+","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":123105160,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)19:00:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123089354\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123089354<\/a><br>Isn&#039;t that guy on the far left the guy from Stargate.","time":1493334009,"resto":123089354,"id":"rf4THNLo","country":"PR","country_name":"Puerto Rico"},{"no":123105191,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)19:00:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123094185\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123094185<\/a><br>Yea and lets forget the trillion dollars worth of supplies we sent the allies. lol","time":1493334020,"resto":123089354,"id":"z0MCxBb2","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123105279,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)19:01:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123105018\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123105018<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Joseph Stalin, during the Tehran Conference in 1943, acknowledged publicly the importance of American efforts during a dinner at the conference: &quot;Without American production the United Nations [the Allies] could never have won the war.&quot;[33][34]<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Joseph Stalin, during the Tehran Conference in 1943, acknowledged publicly the importance of American efforts during a dinner at the conference: &quot;Without American production the United Nations [the Allies] could never have won the war.&quot;[33][34]<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Joseph Stalin, during the Tehran Conference in 1943, acknowledged publicly the importance of American efforts during a dinner at the conference: &quot;Without American production the United Nations [the Allies] could never have won the war.&quot;[33][34]<\/span><br><br>HURRR DRURURURURR","time":1493334061,"resto":123089354,"id":"AOHrKB3+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123105493,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)19:02:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123089982\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123089982<\/a><br>You 100% lost in vietnam.<br><br>You sat in a jungle trying to kill gooks with no major objectives to try and win a war.","time":1493334158,"resto":123089354,"id":"1MXMtzHl","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123105594,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)19:03:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123105137\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123105137<\/a><br><a href=\"#p123105279\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123105279<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;American man citing Stalin and Khrushchev, of all people, as reliable, trustworthy sources<\/span><br>This is priceless.","time":1493334198,"resto":123089354,"id":"9S8vuqZ1","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":123105749,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)19:04:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123105594\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123105594<\/a><br>Give it the fuck up and take your retard medication, you sperg.","time":1493334271,"resto":123089354,"id":"AOHrKB3+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123105828,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)19:05:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123093180\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123093180<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;

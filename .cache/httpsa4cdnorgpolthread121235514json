According to the fugitive general, the military took out the banned weapons to the city of Jabl and warehouses near Homs a few weeks before the arrival of the OPCW inspectors. The source also said that since 2014 Syria does not produce nerve agents, because the authorities allegedly have enough of them. However, the general living in Europe did not provide proof of his words.<br>Earlier, Syrian President Bashar Assad said that his country has no chemical weapons after in 2013 Syria abandoned the entire arsenal.<br>Meanwhile, Russia will insist not only the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, but also the United Nations on the urgent direction of inspectors to investigate the incident with the alleged use of chemical weapons in Syria. This was stated by Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov following a meeting with Foreign Minister of Qatar Mohammad Al Thani, Tass reports .

In 2002, &quot;Iraqi defectors&quot; told some tales about Saddam&#039;s government that were later shown to be lies or exaggerations. The (((US government))) uses them to sell a story for whatever it takes to get the public to mentally sign off on &quot;regime chance&quot; and in return defectors get asylum and treated like dignitaries. Defectors made statements claiming Saddam had stockpiles of ready-to-go WMDs. Some of you are too young to remember that but some of you will remember. Defectors aided Bush, Rumsfeld, Cheney, Powell, and the cabal who said confidently that Saddam had mobile weapons laboratories (WMDs in trucks) to evade detection. Flash forward. Years post war, Saddam was only discovered to have old legacy of lesser chemical weapons there were by no means a serious threat to the US by his regime. (((Ironically))), after his overthrow and ISIS capturing parts of Iraq, those weapons are now a serious threat in the hands of jihadists in Syria.<br><br>Later in 2003, the US kept claiming they found these mobile labs. That was a lie. They kept lying about it and right as the lies were starting to catch up to them they invaded Iraq. (((They))) don&#039;t care about plunging the middle east into death and chaos for regular folks. (((They))) don&#039;t care about flooding Europe with Islam. They <br><br>Retarded motherfuckers who think the (((US government))) cared about chemical weapons and Saddam&#039;s &quot;brutality on his people&quot; are useful idiots who don&#039;t understand that the US propped up and sold Saddam many of those weapons.

Typically, a sausage is formed<br>in a casing traditionally made from<br>intestine, but sometimes from synthetic<br>materials. Sausages that are sold<br>uncooked are usually cooked in many ways,<br>including pan-frying, broiling and<br>barbecuing. Some sausages are cooked<br>during processing and the casing may then be removed.<br><br>Sausage making is a traditional food<br>preservation technique. Sausages may<br>be preserved by curing, drying<br>(often in association with fermentation or<br>culturing, which can contribute to preservation),<br>smoking or freezing.<br>Some cured or smoked sausages can be stored<br>without refrigeration. Most<br>fresh sausages must be refrigerated or<br>frozen until they are cooked.<br><br>There is a huge range of national and<br>regional varieties of sausages,<br>which differ by their flavouring or<br>spicing ingredients (garlic, peppers, wine, etc.),<br>the meat(s) used in them and their<br>manner of preparation.<br><br><br>Etymology<br><br><br>The word &quot;sausage&quot; was first used in<br>English in the mid-15th century,<br>spelled &quot;sawsyge&quot;. [1]This word came<br>&quot;...from Old North French saussiche<br>(Modern French saucisse)&quot;. [2]The<br>French word &quot;saussiche&quot; came &quot;...from Vulgar Latin<br>*salsica &quot;sausage,&quot; from salsicus<br>&quot;seasoned with salt,&quot; from Latin salsus [meaning] &quot;salted&quot;.[3]<br><br><br>History<br><br><br>Sausage making is an outcome of<br>efficient butchery. Traditionally, sausage<br>makers would salt various tissues<br>and organs such as scraps, organ<br>meats, blood,<br>and fat to help preserve them.<br>They would then stuff them into<br>tubular casings<br>made from the cleaned intestines<br>of the animal, producing the characteristic<br>cylindrical shape. Hence, sausages,<br>puddings, and salami are among the oldest<br>of prepared foods, whether cooked and<br>eaten immediately or dried to varying degrees.","filename":"1485378251346 (2)","ext":".jpg","w":751,"h":600,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":99,"tim":1490202877344,"time":1490202877,"md5":"6CeFmakNu16grt0RfP\/DBA==","fsize":176811,"resto":117784265,"id":"nxakSZ3Z","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"}]}

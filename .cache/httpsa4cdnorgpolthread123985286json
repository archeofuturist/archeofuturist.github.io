I&#039;m not a cuck or scrawny, but I don&#039;t understand the methods of people when it comes to protests and opposition groups having a go at each other. Wouldn&#039;t it make more sense to hold rule enforced political debates where one side is to make their point uninterrupted. <br><br>I don&#039;t even know how I would react at a rally if people started shouting at each other trying to get their points across. You would think that after 200 years of democracy people would have a tried and true system of political debates. <br><br>What&#039;s the best method of holding a debate, pol? What could be something everyone no matter what could be a part of?","filename":"20160606_212502","ext":".jpg","w":3264,"h":1836,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1493855034324,"time":1493855034,"md5":"f5gExWW53ZZaRjz81gS3BA==","fsize":753577,"resto":0,"id":"CvbxYXtF","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"pol","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":1,"unique_ips":1},{"no":123985527,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)19:45:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"Catbump","filename":"20170412_123620","ext":".jpg","w":2160,"h":2160,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493855150868,"time":1493855150,"md5":"bcymRRZ6c1fKXJUsjZIvxg==","fsize":1293114,"resto":123985286,"id":"CvbxYXtF","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"}]}

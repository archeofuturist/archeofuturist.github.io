It is easily accessible for anyone who knows the slightest bit about torrenting and\/or XDCC and jap companies don&#039;t enforce copywrong very hard against people in the west who pirate.<br><br>2. The wide variety of anime out there (From ABe works to KyoAni SoL, A-1 pictures melodramas like AnoHana, Sunrise original anime trainwrecks, Imaishi hypefests like KLK or TTGL etc.) allows people to have their pick of things they like. There also tends to be a larger focus on strength coming from either willpower, social bonds, or ancestry\/hierarchy. An example would be like in BlazBlue. The main character, Ragna, becomes stronger by finding a purpose. Noriko from Gunbuster comes to terms with herself and is a typical coming of age heroine. Haibane Renmei focuses on the healing from wounds with the bonds of those around you.<br><br>With a large number of themes, you&#039;ll find a large number of reasons for liking different shows.<br><br>3. It is a good litmus test to see who has been around imageboards for a while. If someone posted on \/a\/ asking for source on let&#039;s say KLK, they would be laughed and told to fuck off. It forms a sort of shared heritage in a place without many things allowing such a thing.<br><br>4. The communities are very closely knit. If two weebs meet each other and can manage to hold a conversation, they could probably talk for hours about shows they liked, disliked, the in jokes for certain shows (Code Geass more like Chode Gayass amirite?). This expectation of knowledge makes it easy to get into it since it helps for a way of making friends with someone who is likely to have similar interests.<br><br>5. No shame for liking cute girls who do cute things. I was watching a BlazBlue stream one night and it had the DXD koneko dance and someone complained about the lewdness. One of the confirmed girls told her to fuck off if she didn&#039;t like lewd anime girls. It is a culture that doesn&#039;t suppress male desires.","filename":"20th century tenko","ext":".gif","w":420,"h":420,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491794809356,"time":1491794809,"md5":"ADQPvhoQDea84FAdK+qSag==","fsize":1760382,"resto":120380795,"id":"dKM5VO5A","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120385207,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)23:27:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"Reddit fuck off","filename":"1491794026487","ext":".jpg","w":352,"h":400,"tn_w":110,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491794850397,"time":1491794850,"md5":"Wla4h2tJBYJB1rOg6\/1wng==","fsize":26674,"resto":120380795,"id":"HEuKiUyM","country":"CL","country_name":"Chile"},{"no":120385223,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)23:27:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120385114\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120385114<\/a><br><br>my mug is in flight, sux2bu","time":1491794861,"resto":120380795,"id":"FocmYktT","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120385306,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)23:28:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120385223\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120385223<\/a><br><br>(i missed out on the animal outfit keychains sadly)","time":1491794897,"resto":120380795,"id":"FocmYktT","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120385318,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)23:28:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120380795\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120380795<\/a><br>Asia Studies major here so lots of anime fans in my social area code.

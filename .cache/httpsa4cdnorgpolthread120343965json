Worst choice of my life. Changed 10 girls, i still wake up sometimes with a fucking boulder on my chest. Even now that i&#039;m in a stable relationship i can&#039;t stop thinking about her. <br>I miss something i can&#039;t find in any girl i&#039;ve met.It was that innocent spark of life she gave to everything she did, from smiling to sending me a corny love letter to writing my name on her backpack... I think i&#039;ll never forget our first time also. It was something way beyond sex that i never ever experienced again. It was true teenage love with no worries, no grown up problems, no responsibilities, no &quot;what i do next&quot; in the corner of your mind . just a moment of pure joy.<br>I feel bad for you guys that are virgin or over 20s, now i can&#039;t find myself new girls with naive and innocent look either. They all carry some heavy burdens and mental illness you have to deal with..<br>Why should you negate yourself true love for some bullcrap moral rules?<br>After your 20s you will never find a good virgin christian girl. You have likr 1% possibility.<br>It&#039;s better to find a girl when you can still shape her up and noy wait until jews have corrupted her with television and drugs","filename":"pepe-the-frog-meme-15","ext":".jpg","w":1600,"h":1200,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1491775025830,"time":1491775025,"md5":"g3MrQyyy0T46SMInomF4KA==","fsize":321607,"resto":0,"id":"SXToei5X","country":"IT","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"age-of-consent-nonsense","country_name":"Italy","replies":6,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":120344218,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)17:59:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120343965\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120343965<\/a><br>Phoneposting is cancer, that file name cringe.

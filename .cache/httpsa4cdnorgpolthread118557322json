Out of pride, I said fuck that and left the country to live somewhere else where I without ever making payments?<br><br>For Americans only, what if I want to renounce my citizenship and not pay the fee? Why the fuck do I have to pay the fee in the first place to quit being an American? What would happen if I just left America, personally renounced my citizenship (never take the oath and pay the fee), and go to live in a another country while ignoring all my personal\/financial\/etc. connections with the US?<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Renu<wbr>nciation_of_citizenship#United_Stat<wbr>es<\/span><br><br><br>In what scenarios how, if I can, be punished by the country I accrued debt in if I flee that country.<br><br>In all these scenarios, assume I&#039;ve\/you&#039;ve accepted I\/you can probably never step foot in the debt country ever again.

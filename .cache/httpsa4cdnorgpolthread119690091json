Pro-hierarchy does not necessarily mean master-slave, but that people will succeed at different levels in society based upon their natural traits, which includes level of industriousness and work ethic, and the natural outcome of people making free decisions in society should not be meddled with using the government. Charity&#039;s great, sure. But not welfare or affirmative action. The right values individualism over collectivism--individual rights over collective rights. Freedom of the individual over protection of the masses.

Pro-equality of outcome, pro socialism. Believes that all forms of heirarchy are essentially unjust and seeks to make everybody equal. Believes in collectivism over individualism. Believes that what&#039;s best for the majority is best for society. Believes in controlling society through democratic gov&#039;t policy to bring about a better world.","time":1491446799,"resto":119690091,"id":"ZnzmJ\/ID","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119694158,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)22:48:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119693699\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119693699<\/a><br>oh my, it is the fabled *Based Leaf*","filename":"gasp","ext":".png","w":135,"h":111,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":102,"tim":1491446913492,"time":1491446913,"md5":"U0+e\/Qxp\/c53LjFVXsdVAg==","fsize":16372,"resto":119690091,"id":"0s5iPJ14","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119694319,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)22:49:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119693186\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119693186<\/a><br>you are one of the dumbest people I have ever seen on the internet.","filename":"2253daf01e83df2acc28df0d7f5f5135","ext":".jpg","w":552,"h":414,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1491446993770,"time":1491446993,"md5":"TfMmlfwsU13IK22RJ\/Bg4g==","fsize":34665,"resto":119690091,"id":"ZnzmJ\/ID","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119694531,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)22:51:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"Right need a fight within, but that is after right destroy the childish left.","time":1491447099,"resto":119690091,"id":"3mGzfnIg","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119694603,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)22:52:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"They are both kike puppets.

That means Hitler killed 1 Jew every 30 seconds. (roughly)<br><br>In Auschwitz, the most famous and biggest concentration camp, there are 15 crematoriums. According to Auschwitz survivors, Jews would go into the chamber, gassed for 15-20 minutes, then put into the oven.<br><br>It takes 1 hour to cremate a body using modern furnaces..., which operate at higher temperatures than the traditional hundred year old ovens at the camp. However, lets say that the ovens were operating at a level that we see today, that means it would take 1 hour, 20 minutes to gas and burn 15 Jews assuming they were all burned simultaneously. (Disregarding the time it would take for the gas to empty the chamber for the bodies to be transported from the chamber to the oven.) The elevators used to transport bodies were very slow and could only take up 7 bodies at a time with their weight capacity. However, for the sake of the point, we&#039;re going to assume that bodies were teleported instantly from chamber to oven.<br><br>That means 15 Jews were gassed and burned every 1.2 hours. That comes out to exactly 300 Jews every 24 hours (Assuming the gassing and burning of Jews was happening every hour straight for 6 years on an uninterrupted basis) the total number of jews killed would be 657,000 for those 6 years. The official Jewish story is that 4,000,000 Jews were killed at Auschwitz alone. You&#039;re about 3.4million short there goy...<br><br>How can any Jew, Israeli, or Shill ever even argue this story when just simple math is enough to destroy the whole theoretical rational? They don&#039;t have an argument, they have a paper narrative. Can any Jews respond to this and also remember that they responded afterward? lol","filename":"1488790344735","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":881,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":86,"tim":1492077408346,"time":1492077408,"md5":"65YsKS4dgonbqKO1oKoVUQ==","fsize":252439,"resto":120888773,"id":"G7jsU8wd","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"}]}

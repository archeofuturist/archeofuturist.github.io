Those who follow fascists are by definition followers and weaklings.<br><br>Look up the etymology. Fascism comes from the term &#039;fasces&#039;; a bundle of sticks wrapped around (one could say in rapture to) an axe handle with a projecting axe blade.<br><br>This is the core metaphor that defines fascism. The metaphor being that the many must give their will power up to the one (usually a strong man leader).<br><br>This ideology is by definition about weak people looking to give up their own power or direction (and most often giving up their own rights and freedoms in the process). To usurp themselves, to be submissive... and ergo the whole ideology is one of weakness. Fascists are the most submissive and weak people in my opinion.<br><br>You know I&#039;m fine with people who want to be strong, who want to be an authority; but being a leader is about genuinely giving others help in exploring their own individual strengths, it&#039;s not about claiming the authority of a collective of submissives as if that makes you strong. It doesn&#039;t; it makes for the weakest ideology and followers possible. Fascism is the most deflationary, it poses the biggest lie, and is hence comprised of the biggest losers.<br><br>A human should be a human beyond all states; and hence able to inhabit all states. Fascism is nihilistic to individual authority and hence is nothing but a fragile empty shell that looks tough but ultimately hides deep weakness and as my title suggests; fascism contains some of the most submissive and damaged people possible. People in need of a genuine strength; but looking in the wrong place.","filename":"Willow-Sticks","ext":".jpg","w":300,"h":300,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492732381942,"time":1492732381,"md5":"Ed0V0N8UwxqibWOyaHixBQ==","fsize":5860,"resto":0,"id":"4jJxrhJu","country":"DE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"fascism-is-the-weakest-ideology","country_name":"Germany","replies":45,"images":10,"unique_ips":33},{"no":122065823,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)19:56:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122065477\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122065477<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Fascism is for submissives looking for a strong man father figure.

It seems to me that a desire to be part of a community that&#039;s working together for some kind of common purpose is a deep instinctual drive that many people share. In olden times, this was channeled into hunting for your tribal group so they have enough to eat, fighting for your tribal group so they are safe - the community solidarity and shared collective purpose was tangible and real. This seems to be totally missing from modern society - the closest we have is a sports game, where really the &quot;fans&quot; are just cheering for two different corporate franchises. You can work at a job and maybe even achieve something exceptional as part of a team, but really you aren&#039;t a community in any real sense, you are people hired by the same company for economic purposes.

I&#039;ve seen women who now have voices. They can speak for themselves and they are standing up for their rights. Children are being fed and young people more or less know how to manage their lives. That&#039;s what&#039;s happened since the intervention.<\/span><br><br>In May 2012 and again in August 2012 she criticised Amnesty International for its opposition to the Intervention. Price accused the organisation of ignoring the suffering of women in Central Australia:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;When Aboriginal women in Central Australia ask for help, when they are killed, raped and beaten, when they cry for their abused children, you ignore them and you support those who are oppressing them. When the government tries to do something for them you call them racist and you blather on about the UN.<\/span><br><br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Bess_<wbr>Price<br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=GpH<wbr>0zWIfrL8 <br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=d6b<wbr>1TgdCKLE<br><br>&quot;When we follow our own law we break whitefella law. When we follow whitefella law we break our own. Too many of my people want what whitefellas have but don&#039;t want the law that goes with it...Individual human rights are a western invention. These people are free, rich and educated but they would rather we lived with daily violence and died young, that we lived in poverty and ignorance rather than lose their idea of what our culture should be...We need to learn the best of what whitefellas have brought to us and make it our own. It belongs to all of us and not just to whitefellas...We need to take responsibility for our own problems but we can&#039;t do that without changing the law. Only we can do that, it can&#039;t be done for us...&quot; - Bess Nungarrayi Price<br><br>http:\/\/www.abc.net.au\/news\/2013-02-<wbr>15\/bess-price-jail-is-good-for-you-<wbr>nt\/4521152<br><br>\/POL\/ BTFO","filename":"4230880-3x2-940x627","ext":".jpg","w":940,"h":627,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1490934882698,"time":1490934882,"md5":"vg6Og9eFMr+A9LaAEnQFMQ==","fsize":122476,"resto":0,"id":"GOQejuXD","country":"AU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"aboriginals","country_name":"Australia","replies":11,"images":3,"unique_ips":7},{"no":119020521,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)00:37:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"Born in Yuendumu, her first language is Warlpiri.

No one wants money for it&#039;s own sake, they want it for what it represents. If it were a good in its own right, there would be immense difficulty in justifying two extremely similar scraps of cotton and ink having such extreme value discrepancies such as the $1 bill and the $100 bill. This is especially clear in the digital era; no one cares about a few bytes of data representing what&#039;s in your bank account in an of itself and you cannot rationally claim that certain bytes of data are suddenly worth substantially more than others that are essentially the same 1s and 0s if it were a good.","time":1491372071,"resto":119563740,"id":"vxf3Lkzf","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119574863,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)02:01:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119565270\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119565270<\/a><br>As a recent Econ B.S. grad, I&#039;d say it&#039;s certainly more right than Sociology.<br>My female research professor refuted the gender pay gape myth on day 1.

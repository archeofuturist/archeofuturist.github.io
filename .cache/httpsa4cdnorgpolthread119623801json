There was no real visible energy there in opposition to Assad, only support for.

Usual suspects here in the US media start pushing the narrative again, advocating for a no-fly zone (because the rebels are getting rekt by air power) just like they did with ambulance boy (same actors also shilled for a no-fly zone). Webm related, same anchor was on CNN today playing the same part, advocating for a no-fly zone and being an asset in the shill-game.","filename":"moderates2","ext":".webm","w":640,"h":360,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1491417047658,"time":1491417047,"md5":"M8mFS1HeKoEgtPxONxB\/XQ==","fsize":2875527,"resto":119623801,"id":"p8uo62od","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

Extramarital relations are looked upon negatively, and can even result in the man being socially ostracized or fired if his workplace finds out about it. Prostitution is a natural solution of allowing men to positively express their libido without being shackled to one woman. Were pussy to be officially on the open market, men will only get married to produce offspring, and utilize prostitutes to satisfy their desires.<br><br>Prostitution is bad for feminism, because women have artificially raised the value of their pussy beyond the means of regular men.

French have a history of voting for idiots. Sarkozy, Hollande, and probably Macron. If is because they are an arrogant snob race who thinks it better to vote for a banker in a tie than a woman they consider &quot; vulgar&quot;, regardless of her views. I read all the comments in the main French papers today following the debate, and they seem to prefer the &quot;bourgeoise&quot; candidate to the lower class candidate even though he will fuck them up. it is how the French project their own social status through their candidates. Pathetic really. They did it he same thing in the war.","time":1493881788,"resto":124031479,"id":"gem\/Pv5d","country":"MC","country_name":"Monaco"},{"no":124033518,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)03:12:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"Why are French boulevards lined with trees ?<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; so the Germans can march in the shade<\/span>","time":1493881927,"resto":124031479,"id":"gem\/Pv5d","country":"MC","country_name":"Monaco"},{"no":124034233,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)03:22:30","name":"Anonymous","filename":"IuPygmO","ext":".jpg","w":1126,"h":332,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":36,"tim":1493882550512,"time":1493882550,"md5":"QWIayfiHz32y34niyp\/pPA==","fsize":92470,"resto":124031479,"id":"UcHO61gQ","country":"SA","country_name":"Saudi Arabia"},{"no":124034370,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)03:24:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124032674\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124032674<\/a><br>protip: lefties are not as dim-witted as either you think they are, or you yourself are.

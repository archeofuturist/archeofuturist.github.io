Did you see the Kuznetsov belching smoke and limping around in the mediterranean? Like I said before, their missile tech is fantastic, but other than that a vast, overwhelming majority of their tech was developed in Soviet times. What new tech they come up with they can barely pay for, much less implement in numbers that could change a battlefield. Putin is doing a good job of modernizing their military, but it&#039;s going to take time and a lot of money. Furthermore, they have to develop the supply chains to build new things, something that their weak economy has a hard time doing. All this new tech needs highly specialized industries which simply don&#039;t exist in Russia right now. The same problem exists in China, which is why they&#039;re always stealing\/copying everyone else&#039;s tech. This is why China\/Russia focus on old tech (Radar\/Missiles) and making defensive capabilities a priority.

But the shaping of the stones not so much. <br>Most likely, those instruments had some sort of vibrational effect\/or applied to them, that allowed them to cut into the stones more easily. But doing the opposite, where the stones are affected by the energy to make them softer and easier to cut makes no sense to me. At least not with what I&#039;ve seen or read about this.<br><br>It&#039;s about hardness, you can&#039;t cut something with a material that is softer than what you want to cut. Maybe the vibrational energy made the instrument more dense, but doing the opposite I have a very hard time imagining, even with my crazy imagination.<br><br>Not ruling anything out, but watch that docu I linked earlier tomorrow and you&#039;ll see clear evidence for the stones being shaped by tools.","filename":"1480022571930","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":511,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":99,"tim":1492289199468,"time":1492289199,"md5":"ucRRqmeI53mFJi5jGiFmSg==","fsize":124438,"resto":121214660,"id":"0JAXw31E","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":121259111,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)16:49:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121214660\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121214660<\/a><br>why are u posting this thread every day?","time":1492289343,"resto":121214660,"id":"nT0FEeQ3","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":121259491,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)16:51:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121259111\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121259111<\/a><br>Same reason jews spew their propaganda daily.

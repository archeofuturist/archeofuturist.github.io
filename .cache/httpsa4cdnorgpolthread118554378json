In the end humans will have to change the system they use. That much is obvious.<br>But that is not the most important change we need.<br>Firstly we need of abandon democracy. Don&#039;t get me wrong, democracy is quite good, but it&#039;s outlived it&#039;s purpose, stupid manipulated masses voting nonsense and constant squabbles with no general direction for a society to strive towards. A new and better system with a more firm and centralized power structure is necessary to best prosper in the modern world.<br>After that we still need to fix and change our countries approach to economic growth. Currently aside from the technology which steadily improves production the only way<br>to grow a country&#039;s economy is through a growing population that makes and consumes more. But no country can support an infinitely growing population. At some point we&#039;re gonna have to accept that our living standards are overinflated and not sustainable.<br>Only once we fix these issues can we honestly and safely consider the prospects of a heavily automated society.","time":1490647480,"resto":118554378,"id":"5zP4fNxA","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":118560063,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)16:49:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118554378\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118554378<\/a><br>Reminder that anyone wanting Universal Basic Income because &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;MUH AUTOMATION MAKES MUH UNEMPLOYMENT&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot; must also implicitly oppose mass immigration of unskilled sandniggers.","time":1490647751,"resto":118554378,"id":"xWQQlmoO","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":118561816,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)17:02:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118554378\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118554378<\/a><br>I&#039;ve been thinking a lot about this too.

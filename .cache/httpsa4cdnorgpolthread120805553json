POTUS&#039;s approval rating shoots up to 47%! Trump says NO ground troops in Syria. China threatens North Korea with nukes &amp; tells NK that the U.S. is &quot;not bluffing.&quot; Trump publicly blasts Stephen Bannon (is Bannon on his way out?). Did Trump just admit that tax cuts won&#039;t be passed by August (Healthcare first?)? Trump says he has &#039;confidence&#039; in FBI Director Comey but it&#039;s &#039;not too late&#039; to fire him. AG Jeff Sessions is &quot;surprised&quot; at the backlash to his Marijuana rhetoric. Tillerson meets with Putin amid deepening tensions over US missile strikes in Syria. And Venezuela&#039;s Maduro pelted by protesters leaving rally as food crisis worsens. Ghost goes off on the &quot;Rise of Kidults.&quot; Your calls, Twitter shoutouts and (maybe) Radio Graffiti. <br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=yf-<wbr>PX9JIY_Q<br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ph-<wbr>haA-apIw<br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ph-<wbr>haA-apIw","filename":"Ghost Douchebag","ext":".png","w":586,"h":661,"tn_w":221,"tn_h":249,"tim":1492029778636,"time":1492029778,"md5":"haAtMOFrtyB4s+QUgSkExw==","fsize":56793,"resto":0,"id":"lBCG3l\/o","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"true-capitalist-radio-hosted-by-ghost-episode-489","country_name":"United States","replies":7,"images":4,"unique_ips":4},{"no":120805625,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)16:43:37","name":"Nathan Bedford Forrest","com":"<a href=\"#p120805553\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120805553<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;mfw barely missed quads<\/span><br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=dUO<wbr>redfcsd4","filename":"3D Rage Pepe","ext":".gif","w":500,"h":500,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492029817004,"time":1492029817,"md5":"NK\/A6\/bV2\/1CHqB4jO3ANg==","fsize":2001264,"resto":120805553,"id":"lBCG3l\/o","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120806206,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)16:47:43","name":"Nathan Bedford Forrest","com":"Bump","filename":"Alcohol 1 Ghost&#039;s Health 0","ext":".png","w":479,"h":427,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":111,"tim":1492030063739,"time":1492030063,"md5":"AAJnaZ7YgB5w0jyVrfcb1w==","fsize":380451,"resto":120805553,"id":"lBCG3l\/o","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120806872,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)16:52:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"Gas the Traitor Trump","filename":"Gas the Trump","ext":".png","w":680,"h":881,"tn_w":96,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492030346950,"time":1492030346,"md5":"rtVSwacInaM28Fy4w6gGhg==","fsize":1089372,"resto":120805553,"id":"4s2jpL7B","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120807328,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)16:55:22","name":"Nathan Bedford Forrest","com":"<a href=\"#p120806872\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120806872<\/a><br><br>Going a little too far now","time":1492030522,"resto":120805553,"id":"lBCG3l\/o","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120807536,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)16:56:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;trump flip flops on NATO<\/span><br>this is going too well, hope ghost cracks]<br><br>also check this trhead for lulz<br><a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/120775433#p120775433\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120775433<\/a>","filename":"1438346257280","ext":".jpg","w":316,"h":341,"tn_w":115,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492030609314,"time":1492030609,"md5":"gkzE1ICAm1AWGhM4z8I+3g==","fsize":14555,"resto":120805553,"id":"AXYmdPCF","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120807684,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)16:57:51","name":"Nathan Bedford Forrest","com":"<a href=\"#p120807536\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120807536<\/a><br><br>I remember my first encounter with feral middle school niggers, it wasn&#039;t pretty.","time":1492030671,"resto":120805553,"id":"lBCG3l\/o","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120807990,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)16:59:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120805553\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120805553<\/a><br>The hambone finally climbed out of his storm shelter to do a show?","time":1492030799,"resto":120805553,"id":"VD7ba22n","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

POTUS&#039;s approval rating shoots up to 47%! Trump says NO ground troops in Syria. China threatens North Korea with nukes &amp; tells NK that the U.S. is &quot;not bluffing.&quot; Trump publicly blasts Stephen Bannon (is Bannon on his way out?). Did Trump just admit that tax cuts won&#039;t be passed by August (Healthcare first?)? Trump says he has &#039;confidence&#039; in FBI Director Comey but it&#039;s &#039;not too late&#039; to fire him. AG Jeff Sessions is &quot;surprised&quot; at the backlash to his Marijuana rhetoric. Tillerson meets with Putin amid deepening tensions over US missile strikes in Syria. And Venezuela&#039;s Maduro pelted by protesters leaving rally as food crisis worsens. Ghost goes off on the &quot;Rise of Kidults.&quot; Your calls, Twitter shoutouts and (maybe) Radio Graffiti.

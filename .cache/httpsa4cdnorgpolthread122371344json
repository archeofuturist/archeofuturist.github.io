Who knows? Certainly not the White House.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Trump tweeted today that it&#039;s China&#039;s job to deal with North Korea. And the powerful Navy armada he&#039;d bragged last week about sending to the Sea of Japan to intimidate Kim Jong-un turns out to have been 3,000 miles away from the Korean peninsula at the time. So the U.S. isn&#039;t really doing anything in that area right now either.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The administration has reportedly decided it can&#039;t make significant changes to NAFTA. And Trump has publicly given up on the idea of aggressively confronting China over the trade practices he condemned endlessly during the campaign.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The Russian hacking\/cybersecurity report that Trump said would be done within 90 days of his taking office is not only not done, it hasn&#039;t even been started and it doesn&#039;t seem like anyone knows who&#039;s even supposed to be doing it.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The &quot;major investigation&quot; into voter fraud that Trump said Mike Pence was launching two months ago has never been heard from again.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Israel\/Palestine, the opioid crisis, veterans&#039; health care and a number of other issues have been assigned to Jared Kushner, Trump&#039;s son-in-law, who has no policy or political experience and reportedly developed a foreign-policy position during the 2016 campaign by looking up the word &quot;China&quot; on Amazon.com and calling one of the authors whose names came up.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Remember the not-a-Muslim-ban travel ban?

Who knows? Certainly not the White House.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Trump tweeted today that it&#039;s China&#039;s job to deal with North Korea. And the powerful Navy armada he&#039;d bragged last week about sending to the Sea of Japan to intimidate Kim Jong-un turns out to have been 3,000 miles away from the Korean peninsula at the time. So the U.S. isn&#039;t really doing anything in that area right now either.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The administration has reportedly decided it can&#039;t make significant changes to NAFTA. And Trump has publicly given up on the idea of aggressively confronting China over the trade practices he condemned endlessly during the campaign.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The Russian hacking\/cybersecurity report that Trump said would be done within 90 days of his taking office is not only not done, it hasn&#039;t even been started and it doesn&#039;t seem like anyone knows who&#039;s even supposed to be doing it.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The &quot;major investigation&quot; into voter fraud that Trump said Mike Pence was launching two months ago has never been heard from again.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Israel\/Palestine, the opioid crisis, veterans&#039; health care and a number of other issues have been assigned to Jared Kushner, Trump&#039;s son-in-law, who has no policy or political experience and reportedly developed a foreign-policy position during the 2016 campaign by looking up the word &quot;China&quot; on Amazon.com and calling one of the authors whose names came up.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Remember the not-a-Muslim-ban travel ban? Donald Trump doesn&#039;t seem to!<\/span><br><br>Defend this.","filename":"truckmp","ext":".jpg","w":590,"h":393,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1492917443105,"time":1492917443,"md5":"va6s9PtnwI5lmzDMFB7crw==","fsize":37886,"resto":0,"id":"Bk9UkOVU","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"theres-no-news-right-now-because-trump-doesnt","country_name":"United States","replies":6,"images":1,"unique_ips":5},{"no":122371636,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)23:20:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"Pls no bully I am very suicidal.","filename":"IMG_7388","ext":".jpg","w":429,"h":451,"tn_w":118,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492917600675,"time":1492917600,"md5":"8psiJHZaNY7ueqXpLVMFCQ==","fsize":32183,"resto":122371344,"id":"hTXrKRlc","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122373294,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)23:33:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122371636\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122371636<\/a><br>Yeah, that would explain why you voted for Trump, you fucking retard.","time":1492918397,"resto":122371344,"id":"Bk9UkOVU","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122373645,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)23:36:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"sage in subject","time":1492918574,"resto":122371344,"id":"OyOtUnI\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122374200,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)23:41:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122373645\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122373645<\/a><br>First off, fuck you.","time":1492918881,"resto":122371344,"id":"Bk9UkOVU","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122374404,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)23:43:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"Sage is a color","time":1492918991,"resto":122371344,"id":"+iVvB6Ot","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":122374425,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)23:43:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122371344\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122371344<\/a><br>delete post.

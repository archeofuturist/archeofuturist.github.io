I feel better than I have in years. <br><br>Being a man of principles, I supported Trump because of what he stood for, so obviously I do not support him now that he has made it clear he lied about what he stood for and that he stands for the globalists, for Hillary, for war, and for suffering. I no longer have a moral obligation to defend him. That&#039;s a burden off of my back.

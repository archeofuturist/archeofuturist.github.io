This guy is literally a fucking retard causing international incidents and escalating tensions with nuclear powers just to rub in to Obama. Imagine what the adults in the room are thinking, imagine what the neocons are thinking, imagine what Putin is thinking.","filename":"48706195.cached","ext":".jpg","w":800,"h":500,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":156,"tim":1491892940648,"time":1491892940,"md5":"1h8xcSdkU19xOeWmauV1DQ==","fsize":61353,"resto":0,"id":"v3XACIyv","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"this-is-why-trump-attacked-syria","country_name":"Canada","replies":3,"images":3,"unique_ips":4},{"no":120566768,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)02:54:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;implying it wasnt kushner and trumps new jewish masters<\/span><br>im sorry, day of the rake is at hand; leaf","filename":"1491736093024","ext":".jpg","w":585,"h":560,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":119,"tim":1491893681818,"time":1491893681,"md5":"GQrWcN9EWt\/4yMZ8nyzR1A==","fsize":56765,"resto":120565771,"id":"t1FMBbUW","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120568524,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)03:15:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120565771\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120565771<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Waaaaa...

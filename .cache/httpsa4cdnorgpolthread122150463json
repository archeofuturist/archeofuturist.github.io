When talking with Peterson fans, work together with them to clarify and detail your understanding of his arguments. When talking to Peterson&#039;s protesters, ask them what they think of [whatever concept], without necessarily saying it came from Peterson. Try the Socratic method: ask them why they think what they think, and how it works, etc etc. Be armed with a strong articulable understanding of Peterson&#039;s points (and general pro-western views) and employ them whenever you meet an even slightly open mind.<br><br>Trolling, clowning and silly antics are a great response to hostile closed minds.

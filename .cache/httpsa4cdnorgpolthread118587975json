The Garland shooting left two terrorists, Elliot Simpson and Nadir Soofi, dead. They attempted to attack an event featuring cartoons of the Muslim prophet Mohammed, but were stopped by local police. <br><br>The attorney for Abdul Malik Abdul Kareem, who was sentenced for helping the two terrorists carry out the attack, revealed information on \u201c60 Minutes\u201d from the government which showed the FBI\u2019s close proximity to the attack. <br><br>\u201cAfter the trial we found out that they had had an undercover agent who had been texting with Simpson, less than three weeks before the attack, [writing] to him \u2018Tear up Texas,&#039;\u201d attorney Dan Maynard said. <br><br>Simpson responded, \u201cbro, you don\u2019t have to say that\u2026\u201d The terrorist added, \u201cyou know what happened in Paris\u2026 so that goes without saying. No need to be direct.\u201d <br><br>The FBI argued that the \u201cTear up Texas\u201d message was not incitement. <br><br>An affidavit filed in another case said that the agent also \u201ctraveled to Garland, Texas, and was present\u2026 at the event.\u201d <br><br>Maynard was given documents that showed the FBI agent was in a car directly behind Simpson and Soofi when they started shooting, and that he had taken a cell-phone photo of the security guard and police officer who engaged in a firefight with the terrorists. <br><br>\u201cThe idea that he\u2019s right there 30 seconds before the attack happens is just incredible to me,\u201d Maynard said.","filename":"Muhammad Art Exhibit","ext":".jpg","w":570,"h":678,"tn_w":210,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490662351391,"time":1490662351,"md5":"tdURLEnR\/YmaEtL02E\/pmg==","fsize":140745,"resto":0,"id":"KsUvhCvj","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"fbi-was-at-texas-terrorist-attack-did-nothing","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":1,"unique_ips":3},{"no":118588200,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)20:54:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"this is slander!!","filename":"Special Agent Pepe","ext":".png","w":796,"h":934,"tn_w":106,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490662477696,"time":1490662477,"md5":"e+VjimPng+jcohG2KtlNqg==","fsize":282991,"resto":118587975,"id":"2+WAwjk2","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118588434,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)20:56:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"DELET","time":1490662605,"resto":118587975,"id":"9N1TkYT4","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

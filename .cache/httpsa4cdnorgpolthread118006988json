Rightist paranoia and biological creationism share commonalities. Creationism posits a powerful intentional agency behind the design of life. Cultural creationism posits powerful intentional agencies as being behind the direction of culture (embodied by the nefarious magical omnipotent super-jews.) The evolutionary analogue of cultural change is that processes, biases, and trends that are behind such change, it is a bottom-up phenomenon following certain variable and changing rules of cultural transmission. To create true change is then to expose some of these rules and how they are fake news, such as the commitment to political ideology over truth. I think you can see at this point the contradiction between this view and modern rightism, which is as strongly against this as you can get. It is true that the left as a cultural mass has some of the same flaws, but they are not nearly as catastrophic to discourse, and leftism&#039;s high valuation of analytical self error-checking prohibits the excesses of politically convenient bullshittery that the right exhibits.","time":1490315274,"resto":118006988,"id":"bxcuX55c","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118011473,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)20:29:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118006988\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118006988<\/a><br>The response to its own weakening has been conservatism doubling down on exploiting human psychology to derail discourse (which includes analysis to knock down bogus claims) to generate paranoia and hate to try to shout out opposition and encourage epidemics of conservative memes that thrive in such environments. Welcome to the Nazi Zombie apocalypse, kiddos, your brains are all infested which are literally in an informational sense mental parasites driving those with weakened memetic immune systems towards extreme rightist views. However delusion is never sustainable, because woven falsehoods eventually yield to reality when they crash into it, unable to lie themselves out of naked consequences. Cultural conservatism (or cultural capitalism, as when considering culture as a reflection of capitalist socioeconomics, seeking to preserve capital is equivalent to seeking to preserve memes that have evolved to be fiercely self-preserving and competitive) thus is in a manic bubble that will crash hard, and is actually in the process of crashing hard at the present. Enjoy watching your ideological dreams die before your very eyes, fuckos, hard disillusionment leads to hard inquiry into how one fucked up so badly, and thus to productive change.

It was meant to send a message that the days of the pussyshit Obama administration are over and the USA will do what is necessary to keep itself on top.<br>Lastly: Trump now has the support of the uppity neocon faggot cucks in the US government, which he (unfortunately) needs in order to fulfill his election promises.<br><br>I can almost guarantee that this attack was not carried out in order to &quot;keep Assad from using chemical weapons&quot; it was carried out in order to send a message to the world and the borderline treasonous cunts in the US govt. to stay in line. Trump did not do this for no reason, he did not do it for Israel, he did it for America.","filename":"1461776274553","ext":".png","w":540,"h":611,"tn_w":220,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491577685489,"time":1491577685,"md5":"eP0A3x7lyym+5A3WT6SLeA==","fsize":163141,"resto":0,"id":"+3AspmW3","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"now-that-the-dust-has-settled","country_name":"Canada","replies":26,"images":3,"unique_ips":20},{"no":119963028,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)11:08:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119962932\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119962932<\/a><br>THE DUST HAS NOT SETTLED ALL I SEE IS FUCKING DUST","time":1491577719,"resto":119962932,"id":"N2T23d5r","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119963427,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)11:11:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119962932\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119962932<\/a><br>https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/arti<wbr>cles\/2014-12-22\/china-offers-russia<wbr>-help-with-suggestion-of-wider-curr<wbr>ency-swap<br><br>Ye, I like this new US strategy.

He didn\u2019t sound particularly fed up or angry. He sounded more like a yoga teacher on a meditation retreat in Mallorca who wanted everyone to stop being so stressed out. <br><br>Marr didn\u2019t want to chill. He\u2019d been watching the clock tick ever nearer to midnight as Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump squared up to each other, and he wanted to know how the Labour leader would react if his finger got anywhere near the nuclear button.<br><br>\u201cWould you press it?\u201d he asked.<br><br>Corbyn breathed in deeply to realign his chakras. He wasn\u2019t going to say he wouldn\u2019t press it eventually, but there were lots of things he would like to do first. A cup of herbal tea, some weeding in the allotment and a nice chat for starters. In the event of war, his clear instructions to Britain\u2019s nuclear submarine commanders would be to await further instructions while Labour had a quick think about what its policy on Trident really was.<br><br>Marr was incredulous. What kind of prime minister would pass up the opportunity to launch a nuclear strike if they had the opportunity to do so? But realising that no answer was the best answer he was going to get, he moved on to a less doomsday scenario.<br><br>\u201cImagine you\u2019re in No 10,\u201d he said. Corbyn\u2019s eyes widened. That was a possibility even he had never imagined. \u201cAnd the spooks tell you you can launch a drone strike to kill the head of Isis? What do you do?\u201d<br><br>The Labour leader adopted the warrior one pose. He\u2019d need time to think about all this, as it was a lot to take in. Om. What he\u2019d like to do was phone Isis to let them know the Brits knew exactly where Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was and that they could easily kill him, so wouldn\u2019t it be better if the Isis leader just stopped committing so many terrorist atrocities and decided to be a nice man instead. Let he who is without sin cast the first drone.","time":1492974838,"resto":122464111,"id":"\/l\/hCAAj","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122469237,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)15:14:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122468856\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122468856<\/a><br>Why are LibDems such autists?","filename":"123341245623","ext":".png","w":652,"h":737,"tn_w":110,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492974846164,"time":1492974846,"md5":"Ju+O7bC+thdT47mh88DlWQ==","fsize":604210,"resto":122464111,"id":"NWJAvjrI","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122469242,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)15:14:09","name":"Rightly So","com":"<a href=\"#p122469146\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122469146<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;babies first 4plebs troll attempt<\/span><br><br>Troll harder nigger.","time":1492974849,"resto":122464111,"id":"Hxog48NK","country":"GB","trip":"!!sD6h8LgcbfU","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122469326,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)15:14:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122468856\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122468856<\/a><br>The Gen Z meme is real?

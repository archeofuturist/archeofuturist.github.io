I don&#039;t read theory. I read history and news. I run numbers from various sources, like the fbi database. I use data to make my decisions, not opinions. That data says blacks and muslims on average are not good for my society. The &quot;education&quot; the leftist have is a joke at best. At worst is straight up indoctrination. I have never seen a leftist run numbers or show me a study to prove their point. In fact most leftist I know struggle with math, a skill that is strongly linked with critical analysis. I have never seen a leftist even apply any critical analysis to any opinion they like. No, they believe that buzzfeed article they posted is perfectly valid reasoning. Which brings me to the final point of leftism: reading. Either it is fiction or clearly biased. They love to act like Harry Potter is an actual political argument. They will read fake news sources, like salon or buzzfeed. They won&#039;t pick up a book on economics as that is a direct challenge to their Marxist ideology.","time":1493567415,"resto":123482480,"id":"pMMH5Jue","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123490428,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)11:50:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123488859\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123488859<\/a><br>You honestly believe abbos have an IQ lower than some monkeys because of culture?

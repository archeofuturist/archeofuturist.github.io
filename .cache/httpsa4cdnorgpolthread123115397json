Roundup is basically just the trade name for glyphosate, like Aspirin for acetyl salicylicacid. Glyphosate inhibits an enzyme in the shikimate pathway in plants - essential for plants but a pathway and thus enzyme humans don&#039;t have. The license is for &quot;Roundup ready&quot; plants, which have a bacterial DNA sequence insterted so they produce a bacterial ESPS synthase which is not inhibited by glyphosate. That in turn restores the shikimate pathway in plants even in the presence of glyphosate, thus enabling survival. That&#039;s the whole magic. By the way, <br><br>Monsanto is not the only company producing Glyphosate. Further, it is a rather popular herbicide in use even without GMO plants.

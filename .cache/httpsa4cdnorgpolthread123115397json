Glyphosate inhibits an enzyme in the shikimate pathway in plants - essential for plants but a pathway and thus enzyme humans don&#039;t have. The license is for &quot;Roundup ready&quot; plants, which have a bacterial DNA sequence insterted so they produce a bacterial ESPS synthase which is not inhibited by glyphosate.

GMO is nothing but enslavement and besides humans evolved with plants on planet, ate them for very long time, your stomach is made to process them and some plants you can&#039;t process, while other animals can. GMO experimenting will have known side effects in decades and even then question is who will be responsible if you sell all to big corporations, including food inspectors. Only complete retards promote GMO without getting paid for it.","time":1493343401,"resto":123115397,"id":"mnQvYk0h","country":"SI","country_name":"Slovenia"},{"no":123124885,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)21:36:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123118630\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123118630<\/a><br>kek","time":1493343411,"resto":123115397,"id":"FKBHGl1G","country":"IS","country_name":"Iceland"},{"no":123125004,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)21:37:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123124834\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123124834<\/a><br>Where did I say GMOs were good?<br>Do you have schizophrenia?<br>Good Christ.","time":1493343469,"resto":123115397,"id":"GRCZ2ECV","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123125009,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)21:37:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123124834\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123124834<\/a><br>Bayerag is happening","time":1493343472,"resto":123115397,"id":"zhXIP\/9p","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123125013,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)21:37:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123123218\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123123218<\/a><br>I wouldn&#039;t try to argue with these normies. <br><br>They&#039;ve probably never plowed a field or picked a rock in their life.","filename":"1493252024283","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":375,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1493343473361,"time":1493343473,"md5":"wXZq6JJZnfToE6DH3fGXrw==","fsize":43585,"resto":123115397,"id":"fkgMsDqY","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123125087,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)21:38:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123124344\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123124344<\/a><br><br>Look, I know RTL and Bild have been preaching for years about the dangers of genetic engineering, but the unfortunate fact is that GE is a technology that has <br>(1) not been developed for the military<br>(2) not been used for murder<br>(3) has the potential to deprive (((them))) of huge profits in both agriculture and the pharmaceutical industry.<br><br>The so-called dangers have been studied hundreds of times and the only work that actually &quot;proved&quot; the dangers of GMOs has been ripped to shreds by the scientific community because the author was to retarded to run appropriate controls.

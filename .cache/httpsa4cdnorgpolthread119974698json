It is the Sanatana Dharma, the Eternal Law. It has no known origin and no founders - it is a synthesis of various Indian cultures and practices from as early as 4000 BCE.<br><br>Hinduism differs from Christianity and other Abrahamic religions in that it does not have:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;A single founder,<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;A specific theological system,<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;A single concept of deity,<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;A single holy text,<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;A single system of morality,<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;A central religious authority,<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The concept of a prophet.<\/span><br><br>Hinduism is neither polytheistic, monotheistic, trinitarian or henotheistic, yet it is all at the same time.<br><br>The development of Hinduism was influenced by many invasions over thousands of years. The major influences occurred when nomadic &quot;Aryan&quot; Indo-European tribes invaded Northern India from the steppes of Russia and Central Asia. They brought with them their religion of Vedism. These beliefs mingled with the more advanced, indigenous Indian native beliefs, often called the &quot;Indus valley culture.&quot;","filename":"kalki pepe ","ext":".jpg","w":557,"h":768,"tn_w":181,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491581949662,"time":1491581949,"md5":"WmYzNvL\/h14NvJO9k7zJdQ==","fsize":68492,"resto":0,"id":"dGit5w4u","country":"IN","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"hindusim-general-kalki-yug-edition","country_name":"India","replies":10,"images":0,"unique_ips":5},{"no":119974837,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)12:20:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119974698\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119974698<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Political Significance of Hinduism in this Age<\/span><br><br>All the decadence of the world today has been predicted by Hinduism.<br><br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Kali_<wbr>Yuga<br><br>Prophesied events during a Kali Yuga<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Rulers will become unreasonable: they will levy taxes unfairly.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Rulers will no longer see it as their duty to promote spirituality, or to protect their subjects: they will become a danger to the world.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;People will start migrating, seeking countries where wheat and barley form the staple food source.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;At the end of Kali-yuga, when there exist no topics on the subject of God, even at the residences of so-called saints and respectable gentlemen of the three higher varnas [temperament] and when nothing is known of the techniques of sacrifice, even by word, at that time the Lord will appear as the supreme chastiser.<\/span><br><br>Kali Yuga with regard to human relationships<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Avarice and wrath will be common.

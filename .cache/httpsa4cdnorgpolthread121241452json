Family values are great and all, and Christianity is a thousand times better than nihilism, don&#039;t get me wrong. The problem is that Christianity treats everybody as equals as long as they believe in the religion. <br><br>Even in the times of colonialism, some members of the clergy wanted to convert natives and negros. And as soon as they converted you can&#039;t treat them too bad anymore, after all they became &quot;our brothers in Christ&quot;. This is a clear a sign of weakness, and it all went downhill from there.<br><br>Even the most &quot;based&quot; Christians of today, like the Orthodox, are extremely cucked. They can&#039;t defend a regime like the Apartheid because &quot;racism is a sin&quot;:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Very much so, but that was because, even before I became Orthodox, I saw that the apartheid ideology was directly opposed to many fundamental truths of the Christian faith. As a Protestant might express it, it was salvation by race, not salvation by grace.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;From an Orthodox point of view, any ideology that says that belonging to a group of people who have the same skin colour as you is more important than belonging to a group of people who were baptised into Christ with you is ipso facto heretical.<\/span><br>http:\/\/myocn.net\/orthodoxy-south-af<wbr>rica-apartheid\/<br><br>I think it&#039;s time to leave Christianity behind and make white religions great again.","filename":"Galatians_3-28","ext":".jpg","w":720,"h":720,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492281220839,"time":1492281220,"md5":"lLyUGsTWtQBh5eLg+6NYvg==","fsize":126011,"resto":0,"id":"GD5ANoPJ","country":"BR","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"christianity-and-the-white-race","country_name":"Brazil","replies":6,"images":1,"unique_ips":6},{"no":121241899,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)14:37:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121241452\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121241452<\/a><br>So, I guess we don&#039;t exist then","time":1492281436,"resto":121241452,"id":"482ZKLdP","country":"GR","country_name":"Greece"},{"no":121242229,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)14:40:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121241452\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121241452<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;white race<\/span><br>Define please.","filename":"1287465489099","ext":".jpg","w":400,"h":400,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492281601978,"time":1492281601,"md5":"eiPLgSjR4DlsE3UM2kmPaw==","fsize":36512,"resto":121241452,"id":"psDV4D2q","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121242561,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)14:42:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"This quote is ridiculous in this context.

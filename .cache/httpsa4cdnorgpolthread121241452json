Family values are great and all, and Christianity is a thousand times better than nihilism, don&#039;t get me wrong. The problem is that Christianity treats everybody as equals as long as they believe in the religion. <br><br>Even in the times of colonialism, some members of the clergy wanted to convert natives and negros. And as soon as they converted you can&#039;t treat them too bad anymore, after all they became &quot;our brothers in Christ&quot;. This is a clear a sign of weakness, and it all went downhill from there.<br><br>Even the most &quot;based&quot; Christians of today, like the Orthodox, are extremely cucked. They can&#039;t defend a regime like the Apartheid because &quot;racism is a sin&quot;:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Very much so, but that was because, even before I became Orthodox, I saw that the apartheid ideology was directly opposed to many fundamental truths of the Christian faith.

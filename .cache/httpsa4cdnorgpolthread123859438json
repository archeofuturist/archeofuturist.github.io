I used to browse Reddit and still do for niche topics and interests. I have moderated the Donald since it was pretty new, and it didn&#039;t used to be how it is now. It started out very much like \/pol\/ lite, on the right track but very watered down but still more than enough to trigger the rest of the site and piss them off, which is why i even bothered to get involved in the first place. I get off on death threats and doxx threat pms from assblasted redditors. But the donald has only devolved further into shit that disgusts me like the pandering to trannies and now it&#039;s basically ass backwards and the whole place is doing the very thing it set out not to do, which was play identity politics and pander. It&#039;s fucked. Non of the original mods are still around who were actually pretty cool dudes. Top mod is a roastie. And most of the users are circlejerk faggots. <br><br>I will say this, whatever you may think of the place and whatever it has become, it served it&#039;s purpose in getting Trump elected, and continues to serve the purpose of pissing off the rest of Reddit and causing problems for the kike admins. I just wish the redditfugees would fucking respect the rules and lurk before posting.

For humans to actually be Imagers, they had to eat from the Tree of Knowledge, giving them choice in their actions, and making them know how to do evil and such, making them truly free willed, thus making them Imagers of God.<br><br>I cant continue this for now, have a guitar lesson to do. <br><br>If you really want too understand the Bible (and I really ask you guys too), before making the decision to believe in Gnostic lies, then read the works put out by Dr. Michael Heiser.

For humans to actually be Imagers, they had to eat from the Tree of Knowledge, giving them choice in their actions, and making them know how to do evil and such, making them truly free willed, thus making them Imagers of God.<br><br>I cant continue this for now, have a guitar lesson to do. <br><br>If you really want too understand the Bible (and I really ask you guys too), before making the decision to believe in Gnostic lies, then read the works put out by Dr. Michael Heiser.

Lucifer, god are basically playing a game. You have to imagine us humans as hardware, and they are the software. They are now fighting to spread their own software on as many hardware as possible, becasue the more hardware the software has access to, the better it works. All this &quot;good&quot;, &quot;bad&quot;, &quot;free will&quot; &quot;no free will&quot; &quot;almightyness&quot; &quot;heaven&quot; &quot;hell&quot; are all just tactics of conquering. They are all not true. They are just different tactics they are using to conquer as much hardware as possible. Basically, the Lucifer software uses other parts of our hardware (the more rational parts) and God uses the more spiritual parts. They are basically fighting to see what works better on the hardware, spirituality or rationality. And if you didn&#039;t get the memo yet, Lucifer has won the battle by a mile. God will also literally stop existing once the last software of his got deleted from the last hardware (e.g. religion has been completely erased) because he literally is the software, thus abandoning God will mean living in a world where he doesn&#039;t exist, but that isn&#039;t necessarily bad. It&#039;s a world ruled by rationality.

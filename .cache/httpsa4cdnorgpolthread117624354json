It&#039;s you, who regularly, certainly TOO regularly, reactivate <br>societal debates, probably to obscure your deplorable failures on the economic level,<br>and particularly concerning the precarious situation of many single women and mothers.<br>The reality is that you are outdated feminists, political dinosaurs of 1968, the long-gone past.<br>Today, luckily, and it&#039;s time for you to realize it, women can vote, work or not, they can get married,<br>they can get divorced, they can use contraception, they can have an abortion if they wish to.<br>What is less lucky, on the other hand, is that many women have an abortion for economic reasons,<br>47% according to a poll from 2010. An endured choice to which you propose no solution.<br>Besides, you don&#039;t even talk about it! No, Madame Minister, the alternative to abortion isn&#039;t<br>solely, and I&#039;m quoting you, &quot;an undesired pregnancy carried to term.&quot; It could also be <br>a woman who has the joy and privilege of being able to keep her baby while avoiding an abortion<br>because she could find the necessary support and protection.","filename":"xqMf7aoC_400x400","ext":".jpg","w":400,"h":400,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490103271591,"time":1490103271,"md5":"3dMmf6pxcJCZG7HjTfelCQ==","fsize":24042,"resto":0,"id":"LSzPhUU\/","country":"RS","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"marion-le-pen-destroys-feminists","country_name":"Serbia","replies":3,"images":1,"unique_ips":2},{"no":117624378,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)09:34:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"I&#039;m telling you, and I believe it sincerely,<br>that you are the shame of the women&#039;s fight obsessed by the colour of the school-bags, the sexism of grammar,<br>the pink toys of Kinder, the distribution of dish-washing time in a relationship. Totally missing the point,<br>missing the real threats that lurk today over women&#039;s freedom. I consider your silence guilty, concerning <br>1,200 women subject to sexual aggression by migrants in Germany on New Year&#039;s Eve, for example.<br>I&#039;m thinking about your silence concerning the shariah, Islamic law, which is being applied in certain<br>neighbourhoods in France and which forbids women the most basic liberties. I understand that this is <br>disturbing to you, since your champion, Benoit Hamon, sees in that Islamic erosion the continuation of the machismo<br>of the French working class. What guilty blindness, if not complicity, or even electoral!<br>Your aversion to the patriarchy as incarnated by straight white males brought you, in any case many of you, <br>to collusion with all the minorities who shared that aversion, sacrificing thereby all coherence of the ideas<br>and struggles: feminists, islamists, LGBT, same fight! And it&#039;s true that all those who today pretend<br>to be guarantors of the right of women to own their bodies, are the same to defend their submission by wearing<br>the veil and their commodification by being surrogate mothers. Isn&#039;t it Madame [Catherine] Lemorton? for example.<br>Concerning this subject, could you enlightened me, Madame President of the Commission, when you explain in your speech <br>that a child suffers when his parents may talk about him as an &quot;accident&quot;?

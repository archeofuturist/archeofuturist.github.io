I do my best to inform him of how communities require land, labour and capital to self sustain themselves or acquire goods and services previously considered to be unattainable. <br><br>I then proceed to tell him that borders are not drawn merely because of some failure to comply between two separate governments but rather two separate communities that collectively have their own definition of what an ideal society is. I also show him how the global map looked 100 years ago and how Africa did not have established large scale states but rather microstates (tribes) and the constant struggle to gather resources meant that territories were redrawn in such short time that it would be redundant to draw borders in the first place.<br><br>For example, let&#039;s look at California, Oregon, British Columbia (a Canadian province) and Washington. We are all familiar that these regions share a common perspective of what an ideal society should be like. Once the governing body of these regions conflict with their perspectives they are likely to secede. Now let&#039;s say that these regions belong to a federation that encompasses the entire globe. Regardless of the methodology the federation chooses to prevent a secession it will eventually breed sentiments and cause more instances like this one to arise in the future. Now let&#039;s say they succeeded; the established microstates (if held long enough) would draw out its boarders and we are back to square one all over again.<br><br>These concepts are flawed because it defies the fundamental principles of how man operates by nature; which is to grow, acquire and compartmentalize.<br><br>Anyway, how do I redpill my friend?","time":1492043352,"resto":120837588,"id":"VOnCTDAd","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]}

Wasn&#039;t sure how until I came across article. Apparently snowflakes attack their own over suicide. Did you know this show may encourage kids to kill themselves? Shame on Netflix and shame on Selena Gomez for directing it! Let&#039;s get the meme machine churning and get the hash tags trending shaming Netflix. After it catches on we shame Selena. Involving her upfront may turn some weak minded folks away from the cause. <br><br>Oh wow, while I was writing this I found out my neighbor&#039;s 15 year old daughter killed herself after making a 13 episode podcast. If only this show didn&#039;t exist then Chelsea may still be with us.","filename":"13-reasons-why-1","ext":".png","w":301,"h":302,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493224873380,"time":1493224873,"md5":"kpE2+QSq23hp55VLIYEBHg==","fsize":102809,"resto":0,"id":"1zxekHeX","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"13-reasons-why-lets-go","country_name":"United States","replies":23,"images":3,"unique_ips":14},{"no":122904452,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)12:43:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"What&#039;s wrong with stupid people killing themself, \/pol\/?

If Trump does nothing, he appears weak, and it invites mischief from other countries. But if he launches 59 Tomahawk missiles at a Syrian military air base base...<br><br>1. He just solved for the allegation that he is Putin\u2019s puppet. He doesn\u2019t look like Putin\u2019s puppet today. And that was Trump\u2019s biggest problem, which made it America\u2019s problem too. No one wants a president who is under a cloud of suspicion about Russian influence.<br><br>2. He solved (partly) for the allegation that he is incompetent. You can hate this military action, but even Trump\u2019s critics will call it measured and rational. Like it or not, President Trump\u2019s credibility is likely to rise because of this, if not his popularity. Successful military action does that for presidents.<br><br>3. He just set the table for his conversations with China about North Korea. Does China doubt Trump will take care of the problem in China\u2019s own backyard if they don\u2019t take care of it themselves? That negotiation just got easier.<br><br>4. Iran might be feeling a bit more flexible when it\u2019s time to talk about their nuclear program.<br><br>5. His plan of a Syrian Safe Zone requires dominating the Syrian Air Force for security. That just got easier.<br><br>6. Syria\u2019s government just got more flexible. It probably wants to keep the rest of its military.<br><br>If it turns out that the sarin gas attack that sparked this military action didn\u2019t come from Assad, it doesn\u2019t much matter. President Trump will bank all of the benefits above even if the attack turns out to be a hoax. We know Assad had some chemical weapons at one point, and probably used them. No one will be crying for Assad if the attack was unnecessary. And realistically, the public will never be 100% sure who was behind the attack.","filename":"polbeingraided","ext":".jpg","w":627,"h":456,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":90,"tim":1491604394036,"time":1491604394,"md5":"TqBvvOwO\/a8BMMXOyc1+ow==","fsize":86061,"resto":120036975,"id":"PrbCeCPv","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120037117,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)18:33:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"why is rand always right?","time":1491604411,"resto":120036975,"id":"PJB7LR2k","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120037155,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)18:33:46","name":"Anonymous","filename":"discord raid on pol","ext":".png","w":1281,"h":562,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":54,"tim":1491604426417,"time":1491604426,"md5":"Tdo3cdO57QK4EAdUww+29A==","fsize":133032,"resto":120036975,"id":"pDMFBbbU","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120037208,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)18:34:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120036975\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120036975<\/a><br>post the real version, that looks like an edit","time":1491604453,"resto":120036975,"id":"7r0iuPbp","country":"AR","country_name":"Argentina"},{"no":120037357,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)18:35:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120037075\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120037075<\/a><br>He copy and pasted the t_d brainlet comment again","filename":"laughinggirls.jpg","ext":".jpg","w":1252,"h":1252,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491604500469,"time":1491604500,"md5":"uOZNBQBYVLUuT\/AY0ZBglQ==","fsize":277388,"resto":120036975,"id":"1bgHPXQe","country":"CA","m_img":1,"country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120037358,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)18:35:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120037117\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120037117<\/a><br>rand is the second coming, <br>he will die for our sins...","time":1491604502,"resto":120036975,"id":"45yM+wxz","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120037406,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)18:35:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120036975\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120036975<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;getting this upset at a few shallow craters on an airstrip<\/span><br>you know what, there are plenty of legitimate criticisms of Trump.

Pootin never was an opposition in the first place. All his public statements is a joke and a clownfiesta. In fact, he is controlled by the same shady bankers, just like you are. Moreover, he invests alot of money from russian budget into usa economicy. He sells all russian natural resources for a currency, that have no bonds with some material resources(dollar, jap yen etc) In fact, he is nothing but a puppet, who s working globalists. Yeah, when u a living outside of russia, you can feel empathy towards him cause of le muh strong public statements and criticism of western liberals, but when you actuallylive in this 3d world shithole, where pootin andbhis oligarches are sucking ppl&#039;s wealth off dry, you wouldnt be so enthuthiastic about him or any eussian politician. Cuase all political parties here are owned by kremlin jews. It&#039;s all nothing but a circuss, to distract slavs from seeing the truth. But ppl here are so tired to struggle\/or dumb, that they will procede dying in poorness and beggar, while pooton and political elite are peacefully living in their mansions and selling resources to fill their own pockets. This country is nothing but a world&#039;s gas station. Military forces here are just to secure kremlin&#039;s power, and to show off sometimes(like in syria) and ppl still buy all this bullshit.

It\u2019s a staple food of many traditional cultures. NASA has considered it a potential crop to be grown on spaceships for long term missions. In terms of energy production it\u2019s only 3rd behind sugar cane and cassava. It produces the most food value (a combination of edible energy and nutrition) of any crop per unit space and time. A study of Fijian farms using manual labour showed that ratio of energy put into farming vs yield of energy was 1:17 for rice and 1:60 for sweet potato. It grows on marginal soil and doesn\u2019t require much nitrogen to grow. It takes a relatively short growth period of 3-4 months to yield. All parts of the plant can be eaten including the leaves which provide additional protein and nutrients.<\/span>","filename":"986587547643","ext":".jpg","w":300,"h":300,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490686874247,"time":1490686874,"md5":"2TqM6QizEPWhQ8kGOZMRXg==","fsize":16725,"resto":118623008,"id":"j\/UjyxA6","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":118625788,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)03:41:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118625698\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118625698<\/a><br>and when they stop working you get literally the perfect goy, why do you think pot is so accepted?","time":1490686896,"resto":118623008,"id":"dU2zyJ6f","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":118625804,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)03:41:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118624798\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118624798<\/a><br>That&#039;s what&#039;s scary, I have seen people accept ideas from memes and TV and then recite it verbatim.

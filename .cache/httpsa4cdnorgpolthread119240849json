I believe there is demonic attachments that can carry over and affect generations through association like an attachment or following. I know Pol is not religious but I&#039;m talking true good and evil not atheist vs christian. I think my family is cursed and I am too because of generations of horrible events. I was also like the kid in the sixth sense when my mom moved us into a severely demonic ally possessed house I began talking about things events and people I never knew but my mom or people close to us. I had psychic moments as a child and always had dejavu. My family always thought it was silly and blew it off but my mom has brought up some happenings that I creeped her out when I was a child with my stories about people that passed before I was born or my extended knowledge of things that happened in certain houses along with descriptions of the insides although I wasn&#039;t alive then. I&#039;m not into paranormal activity but im sensitive to it. I didn&#039;t ask for this. I truly believe I&#039;m cursed. I&#039;ve traced it back as far as my family can be. It freaks me out and can&#039;t talk to anyone about it.","filename":"Screenshot_2017-04-02-15-09-38-1","ext":".png","w":1080,"h":787,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":182,"tim":1491164387154,"time":1491164387,"md5":"TdesolRnzi1ByAjW4yBGnA==","fsize":395641,"resto":0,"id":"3qx+V8Cm","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"does-pol-believe-in-curses-i-think-im-cursed","country_name":"United States","replies":10,"images":1,"unique_ips":9},{"no":119241509,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)16:25:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119240849\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119240849<\/a><br>Don&#039;t know about anything like that, but I do believe that we are connected to other living beings\/animals that we have been in proximity to in some yet to be explained by science physical sense. Too much evidence to deny this.

But it seems to me the reason is because most of our wars have been smaller conflicts. Do you think a larger war, similar to the scale and severity of say, Korea, Vietnam or even WWII; in these cases would war crimes be looked over and ignored more than to smaller wars such as Afghanistan or Iraq. What am asking is, are war crimes pretty much impossible to commit without being ratted out?<br><br>Furthermore, do you (personally) believe laws, and rules like this should even be in place in a battlefield?<br><br>Article here for those interested: http:\/\/www.dailymail.co.uk\/news\/art<wbr>icle-3863450\/Mercy-killing-job-say-<wbr>SAS-veterans-Ex-soldiers-Special-Fo<wbr>rces-man-facing-war-crimes-probe-sa<wbr>y-action-Iraq-ambush-unwritten-rule<wbr>-combat.html","filename":"901a5b45058417c979ed376ced97d6f8","ext":".jpg","w":564,"h":424,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":187,"tim":1492907823223,"time":1492907823,"md5":"Dz6c9gKbOUIRJgDyXCCkrQ==","fsize":30794,"resto":0,"id":"fWt6wRc2","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"war-crimes","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":3,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":122353541,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)20:41:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122352985\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122352985<\/a><br>Most of today&#039;s wars are asymmetric wars. Typically one side has a superior technological advantage and the other is fighting an insurgency\/guerilla war. In these sorts of cases, when soldiers are fighting an unseen enemy for extended periods of time, there is a very high chance of war crimes being committed. This can be seen all the way back during the American Revolution when British soldiers went beserk after the Battle of Concord because the rebels weren&#039;t fighting like a normal army. More recently, incidents such as My Lai and Haditha also point this out. <br><br>My point is that when Soldiers are fighting against soldier in an equal capacity, there tends to be a lessening of war crimes. When soldiers are fighting a hidden enemy, then there is the added stress and these kinds of incidents, when they do happen, are usually full on massacres.","time":1492908102,"resto":122352985,"id":"0ZOmDz5q","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122354540,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)20:50:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122353541\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122353541<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;when Soldiers are fighting against soldier in an equal capacity, there tends to be a lessening of war crimes<\/span><br>How do you explain WWII then?","time":1492908602,"resto":122352985,"id":"fWt6wRc2","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122354669,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)20:51:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122354540\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122354540<\/a><br>Communists and Japs aren&#039;t human","time":1492908667,"resto":122352985,"id":"GlztYP\/8","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

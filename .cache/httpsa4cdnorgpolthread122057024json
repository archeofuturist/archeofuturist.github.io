Fuck you. I&#039;ve had it. I&#039;ve tried to play nice. I&#039;ve tried to laugh it off. But enough is enough. The Canada-hate thing is getting old. I know we have a reputation for being kind and polite, but that ends now.<br><br>The Canada-hate has to stop. First of all, it&#039;s based off a lie - that we&#039;re cucked because our Prime Minister is a \u201ccuck\u201d, as you call it. That isn&#039;t even true. Justin Trudeau is a former boxer, snowboarder, and environmentalist. Name me one &quot;real&quot; man who can claim even two of those things! He said if you kill your enemies they win, because if you have to resort to killing, that means you couldn&#039;t hold your own in a ration debate. Secondly, Canadians aren&#039;t shitposters. We speak our feelings. We tell you the truth. We share our opinions. If that&#039;s what counts as shitposting these days, then call me an Aussie. I don&#039;t know why Americans are so intimidated by hearing genuine, thoughtful criticism of their country and their politics, but you obviously are. All I can say to that is: deal with it. It&#039;s the 21st century. This is the information age. If information scares you, then go back to your bumfuck trailer somewhere and hang on to your delusions. Me? I&#039;m a freethinker. I&#039;m an idea man. I thrive off of enthusiasm. And I fucking love science. So when a Canadian is nice enough to offer you constructive criticism, take it as a compliment. Because we want to see you thrive as a country. We want to see you progress and follow us into the future.<br><br>End Canada hate now or we WILL leave.","time":1492728842,"resto":122057024,"id":"TV1cbcdA","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122059168,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)19:00:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122058358\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122058358<\/a><br>Didn&#039;t read you cucked leaf cunt","time":1492729231,"resto":122057024,"id":"5ZX0NDgq","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122059331,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)19:01:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122057024\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122057024<\/a><br>Life is only as boring as you are.","filename":"b4f","ext":".jpg","w":569,"h":428,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":94,"tim":1492729307803,"time":1492729307,"md5":"7S3k2Gbyv8zFVGybP\/XxbA==","fsize":23899,"resto":122057024,"id":"bpTakpC6","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122059353,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)19:01:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122057024\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122057024<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;doesn&#039;t do anything with their life<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;life&#039;s too boring!<\/span>","filename":"1468048002173","ext":".jpg","w":585,"h":511,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":109,"tim":1492729317236,"time":1492729317,"md5":"gFoQvpMlN9d+KoubdMZKcg==","fsize":52007,"resto":122057024,"id":"\/Mw0I6rk","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122059501,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)19:03:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122058358\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122058358<\/a><br>Lol","time":1492729385,"resto":122057024,"id":"\/r4+Jb3i","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122060538,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)19:11:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122058358\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122058358<\/a><br>Ajaha just look at this leaf nigger cunt","time":1492729880,"resto":122057024,"id":"DMnpvcx2","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":122062495,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)19:27:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"Life is a continuous struggle to the grave.<br>but then you&#039;ll have plenty of time to rest ;^)","time":1492730829,"resto":122057024,"id":"Q7nOCF8A","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":122064405,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)19:43:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122058358\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122058358<\/a><br>if you keep embarrassing us like this burgerland will never take us back","time":1492731804,"resto":122057024,"id":"fA9zVOzg","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]}

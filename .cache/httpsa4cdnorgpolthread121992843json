If you remember the riveting story; I wrote a video maker, it made a syria wide video, I made a separate regional video maker (that produced variable results). <br><br>Well now I have one script that does both the complete syria and the regions of syria ( as i identified them).<br><br>One of the better video&#039;s is attached here - it&#039;s for palmyra.<br><br>It&#039;s useful because it highlights the path forward for me. You will notice that the maps at the begining of the video are quite small. (wait until u see ghouta). This is a quality issue I cannot fix without deleting the data up to the middle of about 2014 - which as far as I am concerned is kind of ok, as nothing of any great interest happens before this anyway. Also, I will &#039;expand the box&#039; that is used to cut each region - so they fill up more of the screen - it means the maps won&#039;t be as focused - but at least they become usable.<br><br>Also the engulfment rate is calculated for the whole of syria - not the region being shown. I will either remove this metric from all slides, or alternatively fix it for the regional panels.<br><br>There are of course still data issues within the maps, which I will fix over time. But for now we have a single format that conveys of the situation on the ground. <br><br>I have also looked at wikipedia and found that I can use the same process to create map sequences for Yemen - altho it&#039;s not nearly as volatile or interesting in terms of creeping colours and change.<br><br>Like that.

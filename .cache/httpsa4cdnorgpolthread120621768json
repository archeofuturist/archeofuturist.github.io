Why? Because atheism, like all ~religions~ exists beyond an abstract, metaphysical level. Atheism isn&#039;t just some idea, it exists in a concrete world with concrete implications, who&#039;s beliefs and practices are contextualized in a concrete, historically determined world. Can you imagine an &quot;atheist&quot; regurgitating nu-atheist doctrine a millennium ago? No, the conditions that prelude the possibility of its own problematic hadn&#039;t come to existence yet.

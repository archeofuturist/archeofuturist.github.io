Why? Because atheism, like all ~religions~ exists beyond an abstract, metaphysical level. Atheism isn&#039;t just some idea, it exists in a concrete world with concrete implications, who&#039;s beliefs and practices are contextualized in a concrete, historically determined world. Can you imagine an &quot;atheist&quot; regurgitating nu-atheist doctrine a millennium ago? No, the conditions that prelude the possibility of its own problematic hadn&#039;t come to existence yet.

Certain moral norms are implanted into religious doctrine, which itself is extrapolated and refined through intellectual work.<br><br>Rigid definitions fall apart when you realize that contextualized metaphysical assertion falls apart given context. Despite the definition of atheism as &quot;lack of belief&quot;, a baby cannot be an atheist not just because it harbors no belief at all, it cannot comprehend the practical conclusions of such belief. And again, an &quot;atheist&quot; from a thousand years ago would not believe the same nonsense as some nu-atheist demagogue would.<br><br>Religion posits certain metaphysical assertions that conclude or at least imply a mode of ethical behavior. Just because the cornerstone of your system of believe revolves around the rejection of something doesn&#039;t mean it doesn&#039;t fucking posit anything. As I said, just as, to some atheists, the non-existance of an afterlife concludes certain modes of behavior, so too for Abrahamics, the belief over whether acts are necessary to enter into an afterlife concludes certain modes of behavior. And as an aside, Western Atheism has the habit of secularizing Christian behavior into an atheist paradigm.<br><br>To reiterate<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;both imply the construction of a practical theology of everyday life which shapes ethical behavior. <\/span><br><br><a href=\"#p120642511\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120642511<\/a><br>Marx wasn&#039;t an individualist who framed everything in terms of the individual against the herd<br><br>I&#039;m tired and going to fucking bed","time":1491940635,"resto":120621768,"id":"6LJ3ns8T","country":"PH","country_name":"Philippines"},{"no":120646720,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)15:58:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120646440\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120646440<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Gross <\/span><br><br>Get out.","time":1491940708,"resto":120621768,"id":"9zh3HAFL","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120646921,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)15:59:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120621768\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120621768<\/a><br>it&#039;s not that hard to be atheist or agnostic or whatever if you weren&#039;t brought up on religion like i was.<br><br>the only differences between you and me is that i don&#039;t pray before meals and i don&#039;t go to church on sundays.","time":1491940787,"resto":120621768,"id":"6OX\/QnAA","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120647171,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)16:01:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120646720\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120646720<\/a><br><br>what&#039;s gross about a person enjoying themselves?","time":1491940876,"resto":120621768,"id":"MAYp9PZk","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120647243,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)16:01:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120645542\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120645542<\/a><br>Agnostic and aetheist isn&#039;t the same thing........<br>The latin word for dumbass american is dumbass american","time":1491940902,"resto":120621768,"id":"nR+Tbdpx","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120647424,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)16:02:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120621768\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120621768<\/a><br>Because no matter how much they reject God, they can&#039;t deny the gifts he gave them","time":1491940965,"resto":120621768,"id":"iy0WspTH","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120647608,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)16:04:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120647171\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120647171<\/a><br>This: <br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=oN4<wbr>w8e432_o<br><br>You are just one of many devils.","time":1491941040,"resto":120621768,"id":"9zh3HAFL","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120647631,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)16:04:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120634238\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120634238<\/a><br>Way to prove ops point","time":1491941048,"resto":120621768,"id":"IALJz6D3","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120647728,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)16:04:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120639789\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120639789<\/a><br><a href=\"#p120639833\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120639833<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I don&#039;t have an argument so I&#039;ll make up an excuse and leave<\/span>","time":1491941087,"resto":120621768,"id":"6MOD+bIR","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120647823,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)16:05:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120622730\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120622730<\/a><br>Every time.<br>A fucking leaf.

We are all born sinners into a sinful world and will all be destroyed.<br><br>NT<br>Christ is the Word made flesh, a man who speaks truths so profound that He will deliver us out of sin finally and completely. Through His sacrifice He demonstrated how we would build the eternal kingdom of God and how we can all live forever through it like He is. Your flesh will rot and serving it leads to nothing good, least of all happiness, sacrifice it for something greater like it is in fact evolved to do and have your will live on. The kingdom only lasts as long as we stay united in the name of Christ, like OT says breaking the first commandment or engaging in idolatry has real consequences.","time":1491942118,"resto":120621768,"id":"aGv+t653","country":"IS","country_name":"Iceland"},{"no":120650400,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)16:22:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"Even though this thread is full of bait and autism, I really do enjoy bullying\/trolling other Atheists that deserve it.","time":1491942157,"resto":120621768,"id":"zTj8dIVU","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120650487,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)16:23:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120650002\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120650002<\/a><br>But how do you know that supernatural phenomena is impossible <br>Do you have faith that naturalism is the correct approach or presuposition?","time":1491942196,"resto":120621768,"id":"iy0WspTH","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120650539,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)16:23:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"People who post about religion on \/pol\/ are basically trolling themselves.<br><br>It&#039;s kind of sad, really.","time":1491942213,"resto":120621768,"id":"bH9TuO7e","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120650551,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)16:23:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120649542\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120649542<\/a><br><br>i&#039;m bisexual, and nothing is wrong with it feels good whether you&#039;re top or bottom <br><br>your biggest problems with it probably come from your morality that&#039;s likely based in abrahamic bullshit<br><br>i&#039;ve met plenty of &quot;straight&quot; guys who are just scared of what people will think due to those morals, but who are desperate to experiment<br><br>enough to a point where it&#039;s pretty obvious those morals are just repressing normal things people do<br><br>nothing wrong with sex acts between consensual adults","time":1491942218,"resto":120621768,"id":"MAYp9PZk","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120650601,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)16:23:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120650400\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120650400<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;refugees welcome<\/span><br><br>\/pol\/ is a lost cause","filename":"1424106011235","ext":".gif","w":227,"h":136,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":74,"tim":1491942239206,"time":1491942239,"md5":"WS5xUFaeZTSJrP\/rkY0GZA==","fsize":1296488,"resto":120621768,"id":"ctvo9a+I","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120650829,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)16:25:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120650487\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120650487<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Do you have faith that naturalism is the correct approach or presuposition?<\/span><br><br>I don&#039;t think science as it exists right now is explaining much outside of theoretics.

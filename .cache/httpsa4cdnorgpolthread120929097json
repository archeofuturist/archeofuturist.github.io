According to a new study from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, published in the journal Media Psychology, you&#039;re also more likely to be cheerful and friendly than your non-Pokemon Go-playing peers.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The team started studying the effects of the game on its players not long after its launch in July 2016. They surveyed 400 people three weeks in, 40 percent of whom were playing Pokemon Go. Those Pokemon Go players were more likely to be exercising, as well as experiencing positive emotions, making new friends and strengthening existing friendships.<\/span><br><br>https:\/\/www.cnet.com\/news\/study-pok<wbr>emon-go-players-are-happy-and-nice\/<wbr><br><br>----<br><br>It seems Nintendo has created the TRUE red pill. <br><br>If you&#039;d just go outside for a walk and play Pokemon Go, you&#039;d be a happy person with a positive outlook on life instead of being a depressed racist edgelord that wants to just &quot;watch the world burn&quot; posting on \/pol\/.

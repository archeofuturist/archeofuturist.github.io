They surveyed 400 people three weeks in, 40 percent of whom were playing Pokemon Go. Those Pokemon Go players were more likely to be exercising, as well as experiencing positive emotions, making new friends and strengthening existing friendships.<\/span><br><br>https:\/\/www.cnet.com\/news\/study-pok<wbr>emon-go-players-are-happy-and-nice\/<wbr><br><br>----<br><br>It seems Nintendo has created the TRUE red pill. <br><br>If you&#039;d just go outside for a walk and play Pokemon Go, you&#039;d be a happy person with a positive outlook on life instead of being a depressed racist edgelord that wants to just &quot;watch the world burn&quot; posting on \/pol\/.

players are happy and nice<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;People who play Pokemon Go are more likely to be upbeat, friendly and positive, according to a new study.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;If you&#039;re still out there trying to catch &#039;em all in Pokemon Go, then there&#039;s good news (aside from all the Pokemon fun you&#039;re having). According to a new study from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, published in the journal Media Psychology, you&#039;re also more likely to be cheerful and friendly than your non-Pokemon Go-playing peers.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;The team started studying the effects of the game on its players not long after its launch in July 2016. They surveyed 400 people three weeks in, 40 percent of whom were playing Pokemon Go. Those Pokemon Go players were more likely to be exercising, as well as experiencing positive emotions, making new friends and strengthening existing friendships.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;https:\/\/www.cnet.com\/news\/study-po<wbr>kemon-go-players-are-happy-and-nice<wbr>\/<\/span><br><br><br>Takes a lot of text to say GOOD GOY, huh?","time":1492106877,"resto":120929097,"id":"QjYHj+cE","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120940078,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)14:07:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120929227\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120929227<\/a><br>Mom and Dad do.

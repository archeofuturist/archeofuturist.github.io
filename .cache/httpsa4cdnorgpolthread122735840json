Another interesting part of this stage of continuation of british colonies invasion are the strange people that also worship crescents, but painted with bright colors of the rainbows. Notice all those invaders come in some sort of strange communities of rainbow fight clubs where males congregate with males. They spend time together. They are into all kinds of sports and games. Women are some sort of different race from another planet - venus or something. So think of this phenomena as rainbow-crescent phantom of the opera. another bioweapon swarm are those swastika worshipers from indochina. They try to fly under the radar, except maybe those towelheads that do not adhere to the golden rule of &quot;when in rome do as romans do&quot;. They carry knives with them at all times. So don&#039;t ask and don&#039;t tell &quot;Cui Bono?&quot; about 9\/11 when entire silicone valley is in the hands of talibans, burkas, bollywoods, taj-mahals, alibabas, etc.. Notice entire world big data (surveillance logs) are in silicone valley.","filename":"Tuhfet_Ul-Mulk","ext":".jpg","w":288,"h":440,"tn_w":81,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493129369117,"time":1493129369,"md5":"RHT3WAPGrCBfd2ghdR8C8A==","fsize":47886,"resto":122735840,"id":"hJa3nELd","country":"LT","country_name":"Lithuania"},{"no":122737447,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)10:11:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"Frenchcucks BTFO","time":1493129471,"resto":122735840,"id":"CzBHaYFj","country":"CH","country_name":"Switzerland"},{"no":122737788,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)10:14:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Mgj<wbr>Jc7RdJhg<br><br>HE WILL BE TOUGH ON BREXIT AND REFORM THE FRENCH ECONOMY SO THEY ATTRACT ALL THE BANKS LEAVING US<br><br>BREXSHITTERS BTFO","time":1493129677,"resto":122735840,"id":"JKP6KafE","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122738341,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)10:20:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"Surely the French cannot be this stupid.

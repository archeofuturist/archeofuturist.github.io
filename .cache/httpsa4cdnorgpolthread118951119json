Some \u201cLibertarians\u201d Claim that people have a right to what they call (((Free Migration.))) This is incorrect as said before; no one has a right to occupy any property without the consent of the owner. To do so would qualify as an aggression.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; not even the most restrictive immigration policy or the most exclusive form of segregationism has anything to do with a rejection of free trade and the adoption of protectionism. From the fact that one does not want to associate with or live in a neighborhood of Germans, Haitians, Chinese, Koreans, Mexicans, Moslems, Hindus, Catholics, etc., it does not follow that one does not want to trade with them from a distance. Moreover, even if it were the case that one&#039;s real income would rise as a result of immigration, it does not follow that immigration must be considered &quot;good,&quot; for material wealth is not the only thing that matters. Rather, what constitutes &quot;welfare&quot; and &quot;wealth&quot; is subjective, and one might prefer lower material living standards and a greater distance from certain other people over higher material living standards and a smaller distance. It is precisely the absolute voluntariness of human association and separation-the absence of any form of forced integration-which makes peaceful relationships-free trade-between racially, ethnically, linguistically, religiously, or culturally distinct people possible. <\/span><br>-Hans-Hermann Hoppe","time":1490911585,"resto":118951119,"id":"uTmjjPtc","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118975845,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)18:07:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118974942\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118974942<\/a><br>Agreed.

Do you not understand that they would be worse off WITHOUT that employment? Do you want them to starve? The truth is that by seeking out the cheapest labor, capitalists improve the lives of the poorest people in the world by providing them MORE OPTIONS. An employment opportunity is not a reduction of options, it simply gives people another choice. The alternative is to not make the product at all because it would not make economical sense or to make the product in a 1st world nation, pass this increased cost onto consumers (thus reducing their purchasing power) and leaving the poor people you claim to care about MORE impoverished because they would be less employed.","time":1493884388,"resto":124032670,"id":"vYV5qtDa","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124036782,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)03:59:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124032670\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124032670<\/a><br>Where are you getting ~500?

The party aims to help asylum-seekers and those who have restricted residency rights to obtain a residence permit for work purposes if certain stipulations are met. Immigration and asylum law should remain separate processes, but a &quot;lane change&quot; must be made possible, said G\u00f6ring-Eckardt.<\/span>","filename":"1280px-Flag_of_Germany.svg","ext":".png","w":1280,"h":768,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":150,"tim":1491390602866,"time":1491390602,"md5":"F5gcqo55Y9fbB+lyK02oig==","fsize":5686,"resto":0,"id":"aqWwkHdT","country":"DE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"genius-germanys-green-party-outlines-talent-card","country_name":"Germany","replies":4,"images":0,"unique_ips":5},{"no":119595754,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)07:11:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119595663\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119595663<\/a><br>I think this is a good idea.","time":1491390675,"resto":119595663,"id":"Jf9odT7x","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":119595810,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)07:12:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119595663\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119595663<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The Greens also plan to focus on easier immigration through university programs<\/span><br><br>I&#039;m all for this as long as they go back to benefit their own countries afterwards.","time":1491390724,"resto":119595663,"id":"4mzBOuC9","country":"SI","country_name":"Slovenia"},{"no":119595866,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)07:12:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119595663\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119595663<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Green party<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;GENIUS<\/span><br>thats oxymoron Hans","time":1491390776,"resto":119595663,"id":"D+6rayqv","country":"CZ","country_name":"Czech Republic"},{"no":119595867,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)07:12:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"So germany just wants to brain drain the shit out of the 3rd world?

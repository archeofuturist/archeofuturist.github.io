The very, very wealthy, aka the billionaire political donor class.<br>What do they want?<br>More oil pipelines when fossil fuels are proven to harm the environment and lead to trillions in losses.<br>Less wind, solar and geothermal energy.<br>Mexicans, Muslims and Blacks to know their place, STFU and stop voting against them.<br>Reduced gun laws. MOAR GUNS<br>Control over women&#039;s bodies and their sexuality.<br>Control over LGBT people, no marriage for them and gross reductions of their civil rights. Gay bathroom sex is still ok for Senators and State Reps only, of course.<br>Less regulation over polluters.<br>Less taxes for rich, more taxes for the poor.<br>They want to abolish the Dept of Education and have children homeschooled by Christian parents that reject science in favor of religious myths.<br>More religion and less atheism.<br>More guns and bombs and no school lunch programs.<br>Reduced social safety nets of every kind.<br>Privatizing Social Security so their wealthy friends can steal it easier.<br>They want, as Grover Norquist says, a government small enough to drown in the bathtub.<br>Unlimited bribes via Citizens United, unchecked cronyism and nepotism to be at their pleasure with no liberal media to call them on it.<br>A Supreme Court that will rule in their favor on all these thefts.<br>A rich, orange, pussy-grabbing doofus as their Ultimate Champion. Sooo pretty, sooo Presidential!<br>Also, if time allows, to utterly destroy the Administrative State, aka The United States Government, because, uhhh... The Camp of the Saints.<br>So tell me, faced with a Republican Party that wants to make America into some polluted Biff Tannen Pleasure Paradise, what crazy misanthrope wouldn&#039;t despise them with every fiber of their being?<br>Oh.. that would be you, &#039;pedes.","filename":"IMG_2377","ext":".jpg","w":690,"h":602,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":218,"tim":1492576844476,"time":1492576844,"md5":"vUohbUhlKmw+WgeXgUwo1Q==","fsize":109136,"resto":0,"id":"BJu2ij91","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"every-single-one-of-you-is-a-disgusting-piece-of","country_name":"United States","replies":12,"images":0,"unique_ips":7},{"no":121802774,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)00:41:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121802685\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121802685<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;muh appeal to emotion<\/span>","time":1492576889,"resto":121802685,"id":"4sG0QwSC","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":121803070,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)00:44:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121802685\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121802685<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mexicans, Muslims and Blacks to know their place, STFU and stop voting against them.<\/span><br><br><br>stopped reading this thead and immiedetly saged this 1 post by id shit","time":1492577040,"resto":121802685,"id":"6xINKcdc","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121803559,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)00:48:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121802685\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121802685<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;2017<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;believes in parties<\/span><br>Retard","time":1492577298,"resto":121802685,"id":"NHX3Bvr+","country":"UA","country_name":"Ukraine"},{"no":121803962,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)00:51:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121803070\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121803070<\/a><br>THAT IS LITERALLY WHAT YOU SWINE ARE DOING.

The very, very wealthy, aka the billionaire political donor class.<br>What do they want?<br>More oil pipelines when fossil fuels are proven to harm the environment and lead to trillions in losses.<br>Less wind, solar and geothermal energy.<br>Mexicans, Muslims and Blacks to know their place, STFU and stop voting against them.<br>Reduced gun laws. MOAR GUNS<br>Control over women&#039;s bodies and their sexuality.<br>Control over LGBT people, no marriage for them and gross reductions of their civil rights. Gay bathroom sex is still ok for Senators and State Reps only, of course.<br>Less regulation over polluters.<br>Less taxes for rich, more taxes for the poor.<br>They want to abolish the Dept of Education and have children homeschooled by Christian parents that reject science in favor of religious myths.<br>More religion and less atheism.<br>More guns and bombs and no school lunch programs.<br>Reduced social safety nets of every kind.<br>Privatizing Social Security so their wealthy friends can steal it easier.<br>They want, as Grover Norquist says, a government small enough to drown in the bathtub.<br>Unlimited bribes via Citizens United, unchecked cronyism and nepotism to be at their pleasure with no liberal media to call them on it.<br>A Supreme Court that will rule in their favor on all these thefts.<br>A rich, orange, pussy-grabbing doofus as their Ultimate Champion.

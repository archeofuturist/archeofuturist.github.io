We live in California and we used to both be pretty liberal people. Over time, he started becoming more and more right leaning, and I see the shit ya&#039;ll put on here and it&#039;s thought provoking and interesting but sometimes its problematic. He became more and more obsessed with the idea of nazism, &quot;alt-right&quot; ideologies, and has been isolated from the general public at his high school. He lost his friends over time and can hardly relate to anybody at his school. Teachers are feeding him &quot;lies&quot; and the liberalism is unbearable. He doesn&#039;t feel like he belongs anywhere. Today he tried to commit suicide, and had notes in his room that related to things seen here that seemed to be schizophrenically written out. 4chan was definitely a reason for his depression. He would sit in his room all day and browse, learn about nazism and watch Sam Hyde shit. This website radicalized my brother to the point where he went over the edge and did not understand how to cope with all the things learned. I just wanted to vent and see if any of ya&#039;ll could relate. Too much internet can fuck you up, and I&#039;m worried for my brother.","filename":"b210c01f26f7d659f2012284c7c5c02b--frog-meme-frogs","ext":".jpg","w":480,"h":477,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":248,"tim":1492661056637,"time":1492661056,"md5":"kMg7sb2bvXfEANTPbAhbWA==","fsize":34805,"resto":0,"id":"BFyfSloB","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"my-brother-is-suicidal-and-i-think-its-because-of","country_name":"United States","replies":59,"images":15,"unique_ips":47},{"no":121949417,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)00:05:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"Tell your bro to quit being a bitch and come on","time":1492661127,"resto":121949296,"id":"48pB9xld","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121949426,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)00:05:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121949296\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121949296<\/a><br>I feel Anon","time":1492661131,"resto":121949296,"id":"fGI7TFL8","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121949541,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)00:06:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"The institute is run by retired senior Russian foreign-intelligence officials appointed by the Russian president.<br><br>The first document, drafted in June, recommended the Kremlin launch a propaganda campaign on social media and Russian state-backed global news outlets to encourage US voters to elect a president who would take a softer line toward Russia than the Obama administration, the seven officials said.<br><br>The second document, drafted in October, warned that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton was likely to win the election.<br><br>The document made the case that it was better in that case for Russia to end its pro-Trump propaganda and instead focus its messaging on supposed voter fraud to undermine the election\u2019s legitimacy and damage Clinton\u2019s reputation, the officials said...","time":1492661188,"resto":121949296,"id":"g8xSnG92","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121949546,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)00:06:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121949296\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121949296<\/a><br>Well people are more radical in their youth.<br><br>I&#039;m in California too.

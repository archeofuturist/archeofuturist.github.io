Scientists are predicting we&#039;re about to enter a 2 decade long solar minimum in which the entire planet will cool significantly. A &quot;mini ice age&quot; could be experienced, with polar ice doubling, and possible iceberg formation on the most northern continents creating a wall of ice through over half of canada and russia. It could even reach further south.<br><br>If you want to see the end of the world you might have to settle for this in our lifetime. This information isn&#039;t being spread for one reason, it directly threatens the progress made towards halting global warming\/climate change. If things get markedly colder then people are likely to assume there&#039;s nothing to worry about as far as human driven climate change goes. Scientists are looking at the coming solar minumum as an additional buffer to give us time to find reliable ways to reverse climate change. In the meantime climate change deniers are bound to have a field day with the next 20 years.<br><br>Buckle up, kids, and get your snowshoes it&#039;s going to be a fun ride.","filename":"3526245341421","ext":".jpg","w":750,"h":750,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490311476542,"time":1490311476,"md5":"N\/CSrrskz03tseR5SJs4Dw==","fsize":45412,"resto":0,"id":"Pjh95a3S","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"we-are-entering-a-20-year-solar-minimum-prepare","country_name":"United States","replies":116,"images":31,"unique_ips":95,"tail_size":50},{"no":118003025,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)19:26:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118002816\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118002816<\/a>","filename":"good","ext":".png","w":191,"h":174,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":113,"tim":1490311571473,"time":1490311571,"md5":"W0Le9qQ8et2CzzWYhro6AA==","fsize":50577,"resto":118002816,"id":"q5QXwzJH","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118003223,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)19:27:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118002816\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118002816<\/a><br>Nice.

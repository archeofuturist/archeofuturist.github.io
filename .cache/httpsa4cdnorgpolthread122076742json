Most dissenters would argue that transubstantiation simply does not exist like I just stated, and they would claim that all of those documented miracles are just hoaxes. However, I think I may be able to propose an explination. Let me ask you, do you believe in the possibility of demonic poltergeist activit? I am assuming that you might believe in such things given that you obviously believe in Miracles. I believe in miracles too! But it is my view that the Catholic tradition is not of God, and actually facilitates much deception, and as a result demonic activity.

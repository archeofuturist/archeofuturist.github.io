Most dissenters would argue that transubstantiation simply does not exist like I just stated, and they would claim that all of those documented miracles are just hoaxes. However, I think I may be able to propose an explination. Let me ask you, do you believe in the possibility of demonic poltergeist activit? I am assuming that you might believe in such things given that you obviously believe in Miracles. I believe in miracles too! But it is my view that the Catholic tradition is not of God, and actually facilitates much deception, and as a result demonic activity. I know this may sound offensive, but I think it may be possible that those &#039;miracles&#039; are real, but they are administered by demon spirits.","time":1492743881,"resto":122076742,"id":"d2MH6Wzp","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122086720,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)23:05:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122086556\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122086556<\/a><br>Tests done on it seem to imply yes, it is blood and heart tissue.","time":1492743922,"resto":122076742,"id":"3VbHCyiq","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122086848,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)23:06:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122086720\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122086720<\/a><br>Cool.

The question of whether an apparent supernatural event is the product of food or evil is a tricky issue, and one people have to carefully consider.

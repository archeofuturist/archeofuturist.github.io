Getting swole and eating healthy is one of the best decisions I ever made in my life.<br><br>I&#039;ve got a few sick un-jewing tips:<br><br>1. Learn to cook. NEVER eat out unless you&#039;re with friends or special occasions (ie birthday). Cook in advance, cook clean, and eat breakfast.<br><br>2. Get under a barbell if you haven&#039;t already. Universal machines are ok if you want to look strong, but barbell workouts train more muscles at a time and will fuck you up, hard. The first four months I switched to a barbell I gained like 10 pounds of fucking strong quality muscle. Also it&#039;s much more fun to learn those techniques.<br><br>3. If you drive a lot every day, get a car that you enjoy being in. An exciting car has been shown to increase men&#039;s testosterone, and being trapped in a cuckbox every day to and from work is demoralizing.","filename":"1491485955226","ext":".png","w":518,"h":558,"tn_w":116,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492898496377,"time":1492898496,"md5":"JzcXFlCWX7Y\/YkAq0T9DVQ==","fsize":422999,"resto":122331839,"id":"fX6bwPXG","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122334623,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)18:05:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122331839\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122331839<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;He&#039;s not a big breasted girl (male).<\/span>","filename":"1423018659485","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":480,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1492898747159,"time":1492898747,"md5":"UekWOEYf4pIaxo+Va5eCoQ==","fsize":147198,"resto":122331839,"id":"Nh7ghz0J","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":122334625,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)18:05:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122334097\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122334097<\/a><br>thanks for the advice ill give the barbell more attention.

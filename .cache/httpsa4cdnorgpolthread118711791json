Thank Enonce Powell. Despite his later anti-immigration views, whilst he was Health minister in the early 1960s he encouraged a large number of Commonwealth immigrants into the understaffed National Health Service. Prior to this, many non-white immigrants were often obliged to take the jobs that no one else wanted (e.g. street cleansing, night-shift assembly production lines), often paid considerably less than their white counterparts. Powell was vehemently opposed by the Trade Union movement (who feared that immigrants were being used by capitalists to keep wages low by artificially increasing competition for jobs), but there is no doubt that in easing non-white immigrants into what was considered a prestigious form of career, he boosted the confidence of the immigrant population and helped lay the foundations of a future immigrant-descended permanent Afro-Caribbean and Asian middle class in Britain","filename":"IMG_1388","ext":".png","w":381,"h":480,"tn_w":99,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490743041391,"time":1490743041,"md5":"D7HMhL6w63EyJy3QtPG03A==","fsize":193055,"resto":118711791,"id":"pk5ejJtx","country":"IL","country_name":"Israel"},{"no":118713141,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)19:20:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118712769\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118712769<\/a><br>Hence why I chose him for my thread pic, he embodies the hypocrisy of a large amount of British Nationalists","time":1490743201,"resto":118711791,"id":"YTzj3R+l","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118713466,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)19:22:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118712588\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118712588<\/a><br>Checked.

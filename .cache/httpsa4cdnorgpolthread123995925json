Far-right trolls and meme warriors like the kind whohelped elect Donald Trumphave found a new calling: &quot;The Battle of France.&quot; There&#039;s no way of telling what real-world impact it&#039;s having, but with the vote just a few days away, activity in support of right-wing candidate Marine Le Pen has reached a fever pitch on Reddit, 4chan\/pol\/, and otheronline forums popular withthe American alt-right.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;All shitposting units are required to man their battle stations,&quot; declared a recent 4chan post . &quot;Meme war recruits: prove your worth. Veterans, lead the charge.... MAKE FRANCE GREAT AGAIN.&quot; The post urged 4channers to join a Discord forum dubbed &quot;Operation: Marine Le Kek,&quot; where at any given moment up to about 450 participants are conducting meme &quot;raids&quot; to hype their candidate and attack her centrist rival, Emmanuel Macron. Using fake French identities and sock puppet social media accounts, they&#039;ve hijacked Twitter hashtags, social media posts, and comments sections on news sites with memes portraying Macron as a stooge of Jewish financiers who will sell out the working class and capitulate to Muslim terrorists.<\/span><br><br><br>http:\/\/m.motherjones.com\/politics\/2<wbr>017\/05\/marine-le-pen-alt-right-amer<wbr>ican-trolls","filename":"Screenshot_2017-05-04-08-12-11_1","ext":".jpg","w":1070,"h":1466,"tn_w":182,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493860525626,"time":1493860525,"md5":"83zAh6knJRzMc8l0ZI+wvA==","fsize":206027,"resto":0,"id":"5Z1o09ok","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":1,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"oyy-vey-shut-it-down","country_name":"United

This has been part of the leftist playbook since before the internet. The Clintons in particular love this move. When they were being tracked down for things like their criminal involvement in Whitewater, they were able to manipulate the media by saying there was a &quot;vast, right-wing conspiracy&quot; against them, therefore don&#039;t believe any evidence of their wrongdoing.<br><br>Blaming 4chan is just a variant of that. They want to build up in peoples&#039; minds that there&#039;s some shadowy organization of mustachioed men lurking in the bushes out there, just waiting to get everyone. Now, everyone with half a brain knows that&#039;s fucking retarded. But there are lots of dumb feminazis and other libtards who love grabbing any excuse to be triggered, so they buy it.

Far-right trolls and meme warriors like the kind whohelped elect Donald Trumphave found a new calling: &quot;The Battle of France.&quot; There&#039;s no way of telling what real-world impact it&#039;s having, but with the vote just a few days away, activity in support of right-wing candidate Marine Le Pen has reached a fever pitch on Reddit, 4chan\/pol\/, and otheronline forums popular withthe American alt-right.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;All shitposting units are required to man their battle stations,&quot; declared a recent 4chan post . &quot;Meme war recruits: prove your worth. Veterans, lead the charge.... MAKE FRANCE GREAT AGAIN.&quot; The post urged 4channers to join a Discord forum dubbed &quot;Operation: Marine Le Kek,&quot; where at any given moment up to about 450 participants are conducting meme &quot;raids&quot; to hype their candidate and attack her centrist rival, Emmanuel Macron. Using fake French identities and sock puppet social media accounts, they&#039;ve hijacked Twitter hashtags, social media posts, and comments sections on news sites with memes portraying Macron as a stooge of Jewish financiers who will sell out the working class and capitulate to Muslim terrorists.<\/span><br><br><br>http:\/\/m.motherjones.com\/politics\/2<wbr>017\/05\/marine-le-pen-alt-right-amer<wbr>ican-trolls","filename":"Screenshot_2017-05-04-08-12-11_1","ext":".jpg","w":1070,"h":1466,"tn_w":182,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493860525626,"time":1493860525,"md5":"83zAh6knJRzMc8l0ZI+wvA==","fsize":206027,"resto":0,"id":"5Z1o09ok","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"oyy-vey-shut-it-down","country_name":"United

I want to say that America is already a third world country. 48 million Americans are living on food stamps. 26,000 homeless men and women live on the streets in Los Angeles alone. 2 million student loans are in default. 2.5 million credit cards are in collections. 700,000 homes are in foreclosure, or pre-foreclosure. National Deficit is $20 Trillion. America has more poverty than third world counties. It is just a matter of time when the Dollar will crash. Once that happens, you will see riots on the streets. This is going to happen soon.<br><br>Americans ARE NOT okay with the divide, leftist commies are.<br><br>The middle class (aka hard-working, bootstrap-pulling, predominately white) are being raped by leftist gibmedats policies. The fucking scum of the country and illegals are looting the middle class and democrat and neocon faggots are encouraging it for votes.<br><br>The middle class has no voice. Speaking up means muh racist, muh patriarchy, muh feelz, muh lgbt bullshit. Plus, they&#039;re too busy working to provide for their families. If they quit to protest, then they lose what they have. If they continue as they are, then they get eradicated.<br><br>When it reaches the boiling point, things will change, but not until then.","filename":"1490574815643","ext":".jpg","w":700,"h":476,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":170,"tim":1490679030538,"time":1490679030,"md5":"nC5u0wqWndeqqp6PosmsWw==","fsize":136619,"resto":0,"id":"DfeduKRU","country":"NO","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"obama-has-screwed-america-in-the-last-8-years-so","country_name":"Norway","replies":3,"images":1,"unique_ips":4},{"no":118617456,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)01:46:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118616025\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118616025<\/a><br>when will the dollar collapse?","time":1490679970,"resto":118616025,"id":"SzNb8bMo","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118618514,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)01:57:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118616025\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118616025<\/a><br>You sound like those people who are always predicting the end of the world.<br><br>The dollar won&#039;t collapse, the powers that be won&#039;t let that happen.

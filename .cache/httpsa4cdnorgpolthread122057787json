And I am a race realist and agree with much of what he says there. <br><br>But in a country that is only 60% true white, where now a majority of newborns are non-white, we would have to have a battle larger than the civil war in order to ethnically cleanse the country. Even if that was your goal it&#039;s just not really feasible in any fashion. <br><br>Rather, if we shut off all non-white immigration. And preach civic nationalism and American values, we might be able to save ourselves as a nation state. People might call me a cuck, but if the US devolves into race based civil war, that will weaken us and will allow China, Mexico, European powers, or Russia to come in and carve up OUR country. I don&#039;t want that. <br><br>We can fix this, we can turn it around, and if we manage to do that it will be one of the greatest feats of human history (reversing civilizational decline and decadence). Previous empires declined and died because once the values were corrupted the society wouldn&#039;t hold together and became too weak for lack of a better word. <br><br>The difference with the US is our overwhelming technological and military superiority. It&#039;s possible that we can ride out the decline, let our nation bottom out in terms of degenerate values, and then rebuild ourselves up over time, while not succumbing to invasion or anarchy due to our technology. (why revolt when you have an iphone? when any food is available? no one wants to risk our comfortable lives no right wing militais, not antifa commies). If we can ride out the degeneration while the powerful hold it together, there is the possibility that we rise from this a stronger people, and this will become one of our most prized stories and myths.

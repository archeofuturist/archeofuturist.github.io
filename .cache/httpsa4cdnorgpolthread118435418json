You know, not everyone in San Francisco started renting their property out when the market rose - a lot of people actually LIVE in these buildings. They might be rich on paper, but if all their value is tied up in their home then that doesn&#039;t actually give them more cash to spend. If property taxes rise for them, how are they supposed to pay? They can&#039;t, so what happens in situations like this is that you get the government forcing poorer residents out of the neighbourhoods they&#039;ve lived in for decades - out of homes they OWN - by hiking up their taxes until they&#039;re in line with the theoretical value of the property. Do you really want a 70 year old who bought his home 45 years ago and raised his family there to be forced to sell up so that some hipster techie on $250k a year can take his home? <br><br>You know what the solution to San Francisco&#039;s housing crisis is? Move some of the businesses away from the city. There is zero reason why a software giant needs to be based there - it&#039;s not like an industry that needs certain infrastructure or resources nearby. And I think that&#039;s what&#039;ll start to happen soon; people in San Francisco are clearly at breaking point. Employees will get so fed up with the conditions that they&#039;ll just quit and move away, and tech companies will be forced to open up offices elsewhere in the country simply to meet their staffing needs.","filename":"1315609807934[1]","ext":".jpg","w":239,"h":251,"tn_w":119,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490582870053,"time":1490582870,"md5":"fDp6YHz\/\/0yurnoPBdEYtw==","fsize":5005,"resto":118435418,"id":"+dSuHZSY","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118460913,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)22:50:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118459662\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118459662<\/a><br><a href=\"#p118459662\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118459662<\/a><br>That hill billy you speak of has more range time than a &quot;superior&quot; personal.","time":1490583005,"resto":118435418,"id":"jC3YrVv+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118461147,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)22:52:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118449572\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118449572<\/a><br>Guns keep the idiots content because it makes them think they have some form of safety.<br><br>All the while the globalists are fattening them up and making them weak.<br><br>Eventually if it proves profitable they&#039;ll give them something else to feel safe with and remove the guns or just remove the guns from their severely weakened opponents.","time":1490583169,"resto":118435418,"id":"lCDaf2pv","country":"NZ","country_name":"New Zealand"},{"no":118461431,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)22:55:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118435418\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118435418<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u201cWe make over $1m between us, but we can\u2019t afford a house\u201d<\/span><br><br>Someone explain to me how the fuck that is possible.","filename":"1466152727560","ext":".jpg","w":792,"h":792,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":124,"tim":1490583328668,"time":1490583328,"md5":"FM2U6sgUMIqukq0S0\/kUvg==","fsize":222901,"resto":118435418,"id":"zIztOLsT","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118461434,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)22:55:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"I am so, so, so glad I grew out of my dream of working and living in a major city.","time":1490583331,"resto":118435418,"id":"wTNLg7bm","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118461540,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)22:56:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118450013\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118450013<\/a><br>The American people is weak at this point.<br>There may still be some that can have le revolution.

Sick of his 22-mile commute to work, which can sometimes take up to two and half hours, he explored buying a property nearer work.

It&#039;s impossible to change it because every action the city does (including zoning changes, or approving construction permits) can be effectively blocked through a neighborhood petition. They even go so far to block any transit expansion, so the maximum throughput of local roads is capped (which obviously affects the type of buildings that can be built there).<br><br>Even better, thanks to Prop 13 property taxes are capped at 1% of the value at purchase.

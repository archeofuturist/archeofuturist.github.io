Right after WWII, when we had been having major naval battles sinking ships and planes all over the world, testing and using nukes, and just as we&#039;re developing the technologies that will eventually allow us to travel into space, &#039;aliens&#039; start being sighted all over the place. Their ships crash at Roswell and several other places, just like a lot of our rockets and planes and satellites do while we&#039;re testing them. Their governments may be keeping us a secret from most of their population to avoid panic, just as ours would with them. Some of their people would still be discussing the few planes and rockets we crashed into the oceans near them. <br><br>We&#039;re trying to go from the surface into space; they&#039;re trying to go from deep underwater to the surface. For the same reason people spread everywhere--curiosity.<br><br>Maybe they even reverse engineered our tech and decided going to the moon wouldn&#039;t be that much more difficult than going to the surface, explaining the shit reported by some astronauts. <br><br>I&#039;ve always thought that more likely than aliens with the tech to fly across the universe coming here to wreck some cows and stick things up a few redneck&#039;s assholes. Plus, if they&#039;re that advanced, why the fuck are they crashing their spaceships all the time?

My best guess is that most atheists only care about arguing with Christians. Because in my experience, if you bring up religions like Taoism or give definitions of God that explain that God is everything, like a universal force of love and consciousness, they don&#039;t care about that.<br><br>And where did this modern concept come from that science and spirituality or religion can&#039;t coexist? I swear, liberal scientists are just the priests for atheists. These people refuse to believe anything that has been tested in a lab and had peer reviewed papers written about it, seemingly even if they experience it for themselves. Sad, really.","filename":"5113lJZJQuL._SX326_BO1,204,203,200_","ext":".jpg","w":328,"h":499,"tn_w":164,"tn_h":249,"tim":1492287197679,"time":1492287197,"md5":"DXGG\/xYApvvFDy\/YtNvh9g==","fsize":40280,"resto":0,"id":"D7J6i0rh","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"how-do-atheists-deal-with-the-fact-that-of-their","country_name":"United States","replies":7,"images":0,"unique_ips":4},{"no":121255004,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)16:18:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121254237\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121254237<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;spirituality without religion<\/span><br>I&#039;ve not read the book, but I assume he means a belief in God without being a member of an organised religion, going to church etc.?

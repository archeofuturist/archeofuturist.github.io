A fertilized egg has the potency to turn into a chick, an unfertilized egg does not. When a potency is realized, it is actual. To actualize a potency is to take a property that something had in potency and make it actually inhere in the thing. The same thing, in this case, for things within an instant. While they are simultaneous they are still essentially ordered.<br><br>3. When we find an instance of causation in the world we find some potency being actualized.<br><br>4.

This is the standard Apostolic Christian (Catholic\/Orthodox\/Coptic) view to this day. This is opposed to the view Theistic Personalism, which is God as a kind of individual and anthropomorphic to some degree. This is constantly popular between all laypeople for easy understanding and became popular between Protestant scholars since modernity. How God&#039;s attributes (omni-stuff) are understood differs between these two branches.<br><br>This is not the only bit of argumentation in this field but its an easy go-to example to introduce it.

The French settlers came here and lost their land, yet still believe themselves autonomous; the British came looking to make a new home and found only barren, savage wilderness; Canada fought at Europe&#039;s behest without complaint - but only stopped to think about their actions once the fight was over; now, Canada somehow believes itself a social power on the global stage, a role model, the last truly free wilderness and a beacon of liberalism while the western world buckles under its own weight. Canada is home to the urbanite who considers herself a mountaineer, the political science major who believes he is unbiased, the government who believe they can and will do good by everyone and still reverse the environmental meltdown. The only multiculturalism here is the ghetto and the only environmentalists have never seen a jungle that isn&#039;t made of concrete. America&#039;s founding myth was the Frontier, that wild and unexplored land of lawlessness and freedom. America grew out of their optimism. Canada is just realizing its own witless innocence.","filename":"withered-1285911_960_720","ext":".jpg","w":960,"h":640,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1490609041723,"time":1490609041,"md5":"SS28rDhsLdLEHGUzKdTW5w==","fsize":87977,"resto":0,"id":"XyfxP2dy","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"you-know-what-canadas-founding-myth-is-navet-the","country_name":"Canada","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

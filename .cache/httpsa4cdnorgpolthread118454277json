Mullis said the bill had become too \u201cextreme.\u201d<br><br>A Judiciary subcommittee has a meeting planned for 4 p.m. Tuesday. It was not immediately clear whether the bill would be changed then. Lawmakers have four days left in this year\u2019s 40-day legislative session. <br><br>Late last week the same Judiciary Committee voted 7-4 along party lines to add to HB 159 a change that would allow private adoption agencies that receive state funds to refuse to place a child with an LGBT family. <br><br>The amendment would give agencies broad protection to refuse service to anyone on religious grounds. That could also include someone who had previously been divorced, same-sex couples or couples of different religions. <br><br>Supporters said the amendment would protect adoption agencies from having to violate deeply held religious beliefs. They also noted that many adoption agencies work with LGBT families.","filename":"adoption","ext":".jpg","w":700,"h":525,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1490579602002,"time":1490579602,"md5":"DAe83IVkLH+VJMNye0Mobg==","fsize":147373,"resto":0,"id":"9v4CfY0B","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"can-state-money-be-used-by-those-who-discriminate","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":118455628,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)22:04:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118454277\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118454277<\/a><br>bump","time":1490580287,"resto":118454277,"id":"gyKBZcbG","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

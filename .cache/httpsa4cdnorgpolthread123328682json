Was a libertarian centrist, and still am one. Right wing stuff is just as based on muh feelings as the lefty SJW bullshit. The only difference is in the set of values each group holds up. <br>Left wing cornerstone principle is that all humans matter equally and we&#039;re all part of an interconnected global society. So, if you can pull 10,000 Chinese people out of poverty by sacrificing 1,000 American jobs - it&#039;s a net positive. Taking wealth away from people who have it, and giving it to those in need is inherently good to them.<br>Right wing empathy is focused on a smaller group of people determined by shared traits like culture, ancient borders, religion etc. The goal is to have a virtuous, homogeneous society which upholds traditions and cherishes its heritage.<br>Both of these are similar in that they seek to enforce a set of moral principles in an authoritarian way to achieve a predetermined outcome.<br>Personally, I like to focus on justice and individual freedom.

Why was \/pol\/ so quick to sell their loyalty to trump? kek denied us Geertz and Hofer for a reason and gave us a sign today with rockefeller&#039;s death. We cannot have happenings when we&#039;re shilling for the establishment. It&#039;s time to get back to our roots, lads. We must remove plebbit.","filename":"1479730078148","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":1024,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490059266354,"time":1490059266,"md5":"9VhVpWstCPn+xtZbA\/oHlQ==","fsize":124508,"resto":0,"id":"rnG\/Yy3\/","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"why-are-we-not-trying-to-get-trump-impeached-now","country_name":"United States","replies":12,"images":1,"unique_ips":9},{"no":117565739,"now":"03\/20\/17(Mon)21:23:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"Are you saying that we should just go to bed?

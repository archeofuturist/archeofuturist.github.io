YouTube really started to die (for those who were apart of its upbringing) when it had YouTube Live in 2008 and when Fred went on iCarly in 2009. After that, people saw YouTube as a pillar to popularity and fame, which eventually leads to everything we on \/pol hate about society. <br><br>Now look at Instagram, Snapchat, etc. People literally post their whole entire day in 10 second clips. They think they are being followed around by a camera crew and people I know even talk to the camera like there&#039;s millions of viewers watching from their couch. They see people like the Karshians and Jersey Shore (which is why I say 2009 was the last decent year) getting famous just because cameras follow them doing daily shit. <br><br>And not to get too outta hand, but has anyone realized the overwhelming amount of minorities running these famous pages on social media? I feel like all they do is take a viral clip and insert their face every 5 seconds just to get air time while the viewer is trying to watch the actual viral clip, and subconsciously sees the uploader as a famous icon, kinda like that SoFlo dickhead.","time":1493944780,"resto":124128509,"id":"PSBzsxNe","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124138507,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)20:40:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124136873\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124136873<\/a> (me)<br><a href=\"#p124137488\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124137488<\/a><br>I love that pic its awesome<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;ive got two guns, nine lives, and a pile of cash - what up.<\/span><br><br>its a device, that can create more copies of itself, it generates electricity without input<br><br>if you put things into it, you can get something else out of it, think of it as a 3d printer except yknow how people keep doing experiments on printing food or printing carbon fiber...<br><br>I have to be vague<br><br>thats also going to tank the future of money and commerce too for obvious reasons but it&#039;ll take several years for that to really kick in, since you can literally go down to a creek and shovel dirt into this thing and have it &quot;print&quot; gold or silver bars from whatever was in the sediment (however small)<br><br>plus alot of other industry will get fucked too, since people can just dump garbage into this and have it re-sort all those materials into base components<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; now all trash bins are recycle bins<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; and electricity is free<\/span><br><br><br><a href=\"#p124137494\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124137494<\/a><br>whatever you can to defend yourself, though I think the big problem in the UK is going to be the muzzies and hoodlums who dont care about the laws<br><br><a href=\"#p124137796\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124137796<\/a><br>to<br>be<br>honest<br><br>a standard longbow (not compound) without a predefined arrow shelf is ideal<br><br>use the left side of the handle for the arrow shelf, load from the left<br><br>you&#039;ll fire and reload 4 times faster just like medieval times (welcome to the trick to getting d&amp;d level rapid arrow shooting skills)<br><br>check out youtube if you dont believe me","time":1493944806,"resto":124128509,"id":"T8D22AwW","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124138891,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)20:43:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124138507\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124138507<\/a><br>derp - put the arrows on the right side, left side is how they&#039;re built these days, but doing it on the right side means you&#039;re using your dominant hand to load and it means that the arrow falls right down on the bow ready to go pretty much<br><br>it also generally &quot;points&quot; much better too","time":1493944996,"resto":124128509,"id":"vKulQizs","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124139779,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)20:50:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124137488\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124137488<\/a><br><br>im also cut off from the mass consciousness and outside the employment and social grids so I dont mind talking about this device, since it means because of certain dynamics im effectively invisible to agencies<br><br>however I think whats coming, which is only the tip of the iceberg, <br><br>defeat of the globalists means all the black ops tech can come forward too, all that stuff in warehouses and things you&#039;d associate with area fifty one<br><br>maybe the economy will be allowed to collapse... lately many of the power plays in economics have been hurting the super elite... bailouts are for bailing them out not us.

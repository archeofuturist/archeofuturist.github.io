I want to read what he said just a few weeks ago. Mr. Clapper then went on to say that to his knowledge there was no evidence of collusion between members of the Trump campaign and the Russians. We did not conclude any evidence in our report and when I say &quot;our report,&quot; that is the NSA, FBI, and CIA with my office, the director of national intelligence said anything -- any reflection of collusion between the members of Trump campaign and the Russians, there was no evidence of that in our report.<br>Was Mr. Clapper wrong when he said that?<br><br>COMEY: I think he&#039;s right about characterizing the report which you all have read.<br><br>STEWART: Well, I want you to know I agree with Mr. Clapper. And at this point, everyone on this dais should agree with Mr. Clapper because we in the committee have seen no evidence, zero, that would indicate that there was collusion or criminal wrongdoing between any members of the previous administration or campaign and Russian officials.","time":1491369111,"resto":119567444,"id":"KrJaBNja","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119570608,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)01:12:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119567444\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119567444<\/a><br>...<br>And I&#039;m going to comment very quickly on the leaks.

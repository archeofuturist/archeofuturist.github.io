I told him im thinking about living in a regional town such as ballarat, albury, townsville, etc. he asked me &quot;do you see yourself more of a country boy?&quot; I was perplexed by his question because in front of me an anglo man asking me a question as if i too was a fellow anglo, which i am not. I believed he was being genuine but i took almost as a sarcastic remark.<br><br>Does my lack of personal identity run this deep? Do i no longer consider myself Australian due to a lack of outdoor exposure coupled with increased multiculturalism in which anglo culture has been muffed into lesser prevalence?<br><br>I hate myself because im not white, i fucking hate asians and all ethnics in sydney. If only Sydney was 90% anglo it wouldn&#039;t have been this way but the government and greedy new age Australians are so greedy for extra shekels that they would roll over and sell themselves out to the chinese and arabs.<br><br>As a chinese-Australian i have seen it. Why do you have chinatowns? Why are ethnic enclaves legal? Why do you allow buisness signs to be written in anything other in english? <br><br>There are now businesses that have no English presentation at all.<br><br>The only true anglo area in metro Sydney are eastern suburbs and even then the eastern suburbs are getting gooked up.<br><br>You people are so cucked for allowing ethnic enclaves and it&#039;s such a shame pauline hanson has also been bought out by the chinese.<br><br>Sometimes i think i should just go to china with my grandparents and learn how to be a real scummy gook.<br><br>Sydney, the most iconic city of Australia (fuck up melbourne) to the rest of the world is full of asians, curries, and arabs.","filename":"IMG_5358","ext":".png","w":543,"h":271,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":124,"tim":1493379932049,"time":1493379932,"md5":"KBPRFJ\/OzuRgsbJjHXK7JQ==","fsize":6410,"resto":0,"id":"mxkkNLTe","country":"AU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"hello-i-am-a-failed-australian-born-chinese","country_name":"Australia","replies":11,"images":3,"unique_ips":8},{"no":123185323,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)07:51:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123184861\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123184861<\/a><br>didnt read past &quot;asian born chinese&quot;, dont care.<br><br>kill yourself, preferably in a public location so we can get one final laugh in at how pathetic you are before you go.","time":1493380271,"resto":123184861,"id":"E46JWyPM","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":123185480,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)07:53:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123185323\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123185323<\/a><br>Im going to kill myself in china to save tax payers the trouble","filename":"IMG_6321","ext":".jpg","w":900,"h":900,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493380380142,"time":1493380380,"md5":"2SGnQRjz9IEeKnZSWQj6eA==","fsize":259222,"resto":123184861,"id":"mxkkNLTe","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":123185921,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)07:58:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"Yeah m8 we&#039;re full ay.

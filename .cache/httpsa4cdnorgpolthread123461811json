Think for example of those widely circulated bullshit by so called scientific community 30 or so years ago that humans use only 10% of their brain as if implying that other 90% is not so much not used, but not used by the humans themselves. So think of entire humanity brains wired and interconnected into some sort of distributed computing AI machine where your individual brain is part of it. I speculate it has something to do with people not remembering their early childhood. So SETI is like another joke on your expense where they are looking for intelligent life on earth, trying to understand where is the &quot;leak&quot;, who is the big foot among the planet of the apes. So that is the matrix of slavery. Of course then there are those who have immunity from this. So it&#039;s very hard to tell if such undisturbed human brain is capable of magical feats like learning language in few days to create effect for gift of tongues. So the rest of humans are not exactly lobotomized, but we are. Pure speculations for entertainment purposes.","time":1493547582,"resto":123461811,"id":"zHz0ygLU","country":"LT","country_name":"Lithuania"},{"no":123464235,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)06:22:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123461811\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123461811<\/a><br>notice one of his teeth looks like it&#039;s not from his own body and as if it&#039;s not the same number teeth.

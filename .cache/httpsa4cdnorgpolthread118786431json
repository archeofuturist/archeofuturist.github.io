The Abrahamic God of Christianity ultimately affirms the mythos of Judaism with a few beliefs that tweak what once was. With God himself, he is divided into three different forms: God the Father -- the creator of the known universe labeled as Jehovah and the central figure of Judaism; God the Son -- Jesus Christ of Nazareth, the mortal avatar of God come to act as the Messiah and update humanity on what has changed; and God the Holy Spirit, the spiritual manifestation of God within humanity, the general notion of God&#039;s presence within you.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;God the Holy Spirit<\/span><br>This is an interesting case, given that this manifestation of God has a bio-psychological origin. Part of the brain is responsible for the sensation of the spirit within human beings, and it is both stronger and weaker depending on the individual, and often is not present in others. However, despite it not being present in all people, and having a different magnitude across individuals, this development in the brain is for the most part -- universal. It explains the existence of religion and drives toward spirituality across the globe, but it also shows it is easy to mold.

The earliest scrap of human history, and every piece of the puzzle tells pretty much the same story. But, only two (maybe three) perspectives are present. There is the one God, the Creator God.

There were so many great candidate story lines highlighted by debated without getting cluttered.<br>Season two really showed the refined direction the series took focusing on less arcs and characters what with the reduced number of debates and Clinton being the primary focus. Where season one had build up coupled with a lot of content, season two was a roller coaster ride of emotional highs and lows. Everything from the debates to the MSM looking like jokers were defining points of the entire series, only matched by the hypest Election finale ever. <br><br>but it feels like this season the writers are meandering a bit. We&#039;re several episodes in and there isn&#039;t really a concrete big bad. there&#039;s obama, hillary coming back, and not even a mention of soros despite all the hints dropped in the first two seasons. There&#039;s some entertaining MSM, RINO, and Dem skirmishes with a few riots and terror attacks sprinkled in and it looks like their setting up a lot of possible story lines with the surveillance arc starting to get traction. There hasn&#039;t been a lot of screen time devoted to making the new trump team shine or to past fan favorites like Cruz<br>I hope they haven&#039;t blown their load too soon, but even if this season is half as good as the last two its still one of the best political series to date.","filename":"s2e12-trump","ext":".jpg","w":246,"h":205,"tn_w":246,"tn_h":205,"tim":1491256684388,"time":1491256684,"md5":"RJHr2zA25HOABJkRlhBMXQ==","fsize":8580,"resto":0,"id":"2+MHapOt","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"how-you-guys-liking-the-new-season-so-far-what-do","country_name":"United States","replies":3,"images":0,"unique_ips":4},{"no":119387396,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)18:01:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119386997\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119386997<\/a><br>This thread belongs on \/Tv\/ but I&#039;m curious on what the show is about.

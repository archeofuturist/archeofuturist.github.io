Since about 2 weeks into our campaign on \/Pol\/, CTR and now ShareBlue have changed tactics. Instead of creating pro Hillary and slide thread, instead we made anti CTR memes. We made memes making fun of our director. Then we replied to our own threads and accused ourselves of being shills, and making fun of ourselves. <br><br>You seem to have forgotten that 4Chan&#039;s greatest demographic are trolls. They are thirsty for (Yous) and they quickly saw how many (Yous) &quot;Shill&quot; threads got. You did our work for us. After just a month we left, only one person was monitoring \/Pol\/ and posting anti CTR (Yous) to keep it going. Our entire campaign was run by your own trolls.","filename":"Pepe - Variant 54","ext":".jpg","w":251,"h":242,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":241,"tim":1491162353059,"time":1491162353,"md5":"Uv5n2T41PXYN+1\/a+nc0hQ==","fsize":19353,"resto":0,"id":"wK+3vDEY","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"since-i-just-got-fired-from-shareblue-for","country_name":"Canada","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":119237426,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)15:48:30","name":"Annomyuos","com":"<a href=\"#p119237132\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119237132<\/a><br>(you)","time":1491162510,"resto":119237132,"id":"QD8WtgH4","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"}]}

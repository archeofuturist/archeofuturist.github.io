About 80 female officers and roughly 50 enlisted women are now serving on subs, and their numbers are expected to climb into the hundreds over the next few years.<br><br>For now, the Navy is retrofitting existing subs with extra doors and designated washrooms to accommodate women. But Electric Boat in Groton, Connecticut, is at work on a redesign of the Navy&#039;s Virginia-class fast-attack subs and is also developing a brand-new class of ballistic-missile submarines, relying on body measurements for both men and women.<br><br>&quot;We have a clean sheet of paper, so from the ground up, we&#039;ll optimize for both men and women,&quot; said Brian Wilson, Electric Boat director of the new ballistic-missile sub program.<br><br>Electric Boat officials had no immediate estimate of how much the modifications will cost.<br><br>As anyone who watches war movies knows, submariners are always turning valves, whether to operate machinery, redistribute water between tanks or isolate part of a system that has been damaged.<br><br>On the Columbia-class boats, valves will generally be placed lower, Wilson said. Sometimes there will be an extension handle, and some will be easier to turn. Sailors will be able to connect their masks into the emergency air system at the side of passageways, instead of overhead.<br><br>Emergency air masks are being moved on fast-attack submarines, too, but the bulk of the changes on those subs are to ensure privacy.<br><br>Seats in the control room on the ballistic-missile submarines will adjust forward a little more so everyone can touch each display and reach every joystick. Steps will be added so shorter people can climb into the top bunk or see into the washers and dryers, since clothes that get stuck in the machines are a fire hazard.<br><br>The first Columbia-class ballistic-missile sub is scheduled to join the fleet in 2031.","time":1492711552,"resto":122021087,"id":"CNRY9WYS","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122021175,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)14:06:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"At 5-foot-6, Lt.

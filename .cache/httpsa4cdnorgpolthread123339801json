Work full time in rural area while your wives stay home. Most Americans were self employed less than a 100 years ago and didnt live in kike hives known as cities.

I personally like to rely on music and literature for questions of the mind or soul, as you put it. Occasional sensory deprivation away from electronics is invaluable nowadays for staying healthy. If religion works for you in this aspect I think it&#039;s a great thing, especially if it inspires you to not be a fucking hypocrite who just prays for the world&#039;s problems to go away instead of volunteering for or donating to good causes.<br><br>I&#039;m just against religion utterly where it promotes willful ignorance, intolerance and violence, which unfortunately is where pretty much all three Abrahamic religions fail for me.","time":1493486478,"resto":123339801,"id":"nOAG8ikg","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123355305,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)13:22:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123355044\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123355044<\/a><br>Apparently you are speaking of real Christians and not the asswipe fucks of the religious right.","filename":"BF","ext":".jpg","w":236,"h":234,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":123,"tim":1493486542785,"time":1493486542,"md5":"gfuamE2FdLi6FiMKCP+9Xw==","fsize":14459,"resto":123339801,"id":"cSq6D+Id","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123355487,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)13:24:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123355107\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123355107<\/a><br>so &#039;god&#039; is just a vehicle to impose law and order.

That is exactly how the a universe created by a God would look right?

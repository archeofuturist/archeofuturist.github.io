None of the less Trump started an airstrike against a russian base in Syria. This caused many now to forsake Trump (or maybe its just shills trying to make people do that). However, dont forsake Trump yet.<br>Wether Trump is a puppet or not, it is obvious that this issue gets blown out of proportion ridiculously. The military base was warned of the airstrike beforehand making it unlikely there were any victims. This also means this probabl wont escalate into a war.<br>They try to strip trump off the support of the public, so they then go against him personally (impeach him, assassinate him or whatever). The sudden increased shilling against Trump makes me think he actually isnt a puppet.<br>However dont trust him blindly either. Keep a close eye on him, watch his every step. Observe the future events closely. We cant let Trump now for such a dumb reason that probably will have no effect. He probably was just virtuesignaling that he isnt on russia sides or that he does condemn the gas attack so the people would shut up about him. He maybe did the &quot;attack&quot; to show he actually wants to go after those behind it, to than later find out those behind the attack are actually his political opponents and now he can go after them without people talking about how he just wants to silence opposition as he showed he is serious about the gas attack beforehand.<br><br>Dont forsake Trump, that plays right into (((their))) hand, stripping him off the only source of power he has, the people. (if he isnt a puppet)<br>Dont trust him blindly with everything he does, that would also play right into their hand (if he is a puppet).<br><br>Keep observing, and dont change your oppinion because of something that possibly will have absolute no effect on the future","filename":"based ronny","ext":".png","w":861,"h":1982,"tn_w":108,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491540554496,"time":1491540554,"md5":"MPzOHoEHjUMIadk7f1Eh7w==","fsize":851272,"resto":0,"id":"Mw0vjzsA","country":"DE","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"what-actually-is-going-on","country_name":"Germany","replies":16,"images":3,"unique_ips":9},{"no":119884605,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)00:51:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119884223\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119884223<\/a><br>Bump","time":1491540687,"resto":119884223,"id":"xd7RA\/i\/","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":119884869,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)00:53:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119884223\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119884223<\/a><br>Just say it brother, the jews have won.","time":1491540786,"resto":119884223,"id":"\/HR6ocVH","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":119885029,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)00:54:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"Trump has surrounded himself with GoldmanSachs bankers.<br><br>That pretty much tells me everything I need to know.","filename":"puppet","ext":".jpg","w":701,"h":438,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":78,"tim":1491540842219,"time":1491540842,"md5":"jMmtcgOx8jQg6uP56zAYnA==","fsize":69761,"resto":119884223,"id":"rH2L1AV4","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119885346,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)00:55:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119884223\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119884223<\/a><br>this, fucking bumped.<br>don&#039;t be retards this time \/pol\/","time":1491540941,"resto":119884223,"id":"vUvvvdHp","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":119886205,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)01:00:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119885029\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119885029<\/a><br>that doesnt need to mean anything. imagine you just got from university, bluepilled as fuck and got into goldman sachs. you slowly realize what they do, but you are also already in there, you dont see an opportunity to change anything, and leaving would just make someone else who is probably more ruthless take your place. so you sit there and bide your time. one day trump comes along and says he wants to bring stuff on the right track again, and as you are originally not a bad guy you agree to help him. yes, most bankers are fucking scum, and there is a reason jesus chased the moneychangers out of the temple, but there surely are some who arent bad, even if really few. and my hope is that trump chose those as he knew them from previous deals and knows they have the heart on the right track. of course this is all just some guess, but we shouldnt rule it out. so far trump didnt make a major fuck up. i dont like the ISP data thing, and the continuation of the dronestrike program, but other than that he did good so far","filename":"jesus moneychanger","ext":".jpg","w":555,"h":574,"tn_w":120,"tn_h":124,"tim":1491541227332,"time":1491541227,"md5":"ptVlI3o7k8FilznKBzf\/0w==","fsize":105658,"resto":119884223,"id":"Mw0vjzsA","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":119886459,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)01:01:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119884223\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119884223<\/a><br>You can&#039;t get more retarded. <br><br>Read about the world.<br><br>You faggots.","time":1491541316,"resto":119884223,"id":"3f9Zjobs","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":119886822,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)01:04:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119884223\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119884223<\/a><br>He had two jobs.<br><br>1) deport the fucking illegals<br>2) don&#039;t be a neocon\/neolib in foreign policy<br><br>he fucked it up, unbelievably, he fucked it up<br><br>jews always fucking win.

By God&#039;s point of view, the Jew is a chosen one of God that acknowledges his arrangements. <br><br>The ancient Jews were not (((Jews))). They were Israelites. What made Israelites unique was their genealogy. They could trace their lineages back to Abraham, Isaac and Israel. After the Seige of Jerusalem in 70 AD all geneaological records were destroyed and all Israelites disbanded. The (((Jews))) of our time are imposters who claim a link to the original Israelites but have none because they cannot trace their lineage back to them at all.","filename":"IMG_1949","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":1640,"tn_w":195,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493630958805,"time":1493630958,"md5":"pbx97o9CrYeR0xylZgtn+w==","fsize":462114,"resto":0,"id":"wQgTbwLO","country":"GB","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"revelation-29-i-know-your-tribulation-and","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

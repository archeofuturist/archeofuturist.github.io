I have a feeling even if California overwhelmingly voted to leave that it would not go over well, and it could lead to a federal occupation. Which at that point, the resistance from all the Cali liberals would take a more violent turn. Dont forget about the 4 million gun toting trump supporters in CA. They would side with the feds.

They don&#039;t directly raise any of their own money, and can only spend what&#039;s awarded to them as part of the Barnett formula derived block grant. <br>It is literally written into UK law that Scotland cannot run a deficit.<br>Whether an independent Scotland runs a deficit or not is entirely in their own hands. It&#039;s fair to argue that, in order to maintain current levels of spending post-independence, they&#039;d have to raise taxes significantly. Alternatively, if they wished to keep taxes in line with current levels, they&#039;d have to cut spending significantly. Or, they could keep taxes and spending as they are, and run a deficit. It&#039;s almost impossible to calculate what that deficit would be, given we don&#039;t know what the tax and spend policies will be.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;be Anglo living in Scotland<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;despise SNP with every fibre of my being<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;similarly despise EU<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;voted independence 2014<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;voted Brexit<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;will vote independence 2019<\/span>","time":1492439023,"resto":121529192,"id":"7f6m11Y5","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121531001,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)10:24:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121530593\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121530593<\/a><br><br>I voted Yes and Remain, but I no longer give a shit about the EU, it&#039;s just a useful tool to bash unionists with.

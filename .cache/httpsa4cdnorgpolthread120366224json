What they don&#039;t like is Populism. So Trump has started to hedge to the middle. And theirs arms are open, but they have knives behind their backs.<br><br>Trump simply doesn&#039;t get to hedge back. The elites must defeat Populism itself. They tried to electorally, but failed. They sort of tried to rig the electoral college. But any such thing would have provoked popular outrage. Instead, they have to neuter Populism. They have to allow elections to work, and then let Trump hang himself on Populism&#039;s rope. It&#039;s about taking the motivation and sense of empowerment from the movement. So, no matter how much he hedges, Trump has to go.<br><br>But how? How can they impeach him?<br><br>War, war war. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Why yes Mr. President, if you bomb these people we&#039;ll all love you. We&#039;ll finally accept you. It will be wonderful. Everything will be forgiven.<\/span><br><br>And then, he&#039;ll have violated the Constitution and international law. And Congress will suddenly care. And that will be the end of Trump.","filename":"IMG_2224","ext":".jpg","w":160,"h":140,"tn_w":160,"tn_h":140,"tim":1491785440903,"time":1491785440,"md5":"dJLyUkxBG\/3WrWeEAWxY6Q==","fsize":16067,"resto":0,"id":"hUZ9eHvV","country":"JP","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"and-thats-how-they-impeach-trump","country_name":"Japan","replies":2,"images":1,"unique_ips":3},{"no":120366393,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)20:52:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120366224\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120366224<\/a><br>How many fucking arms do &quot;they&quot; have?","filename":"1491590177772","ext":".jpg","w":620,"h":451,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":90,"tim":1491785521782,"time":1491785521,"md5":"XcC\/PM6BHCWDBfylLhQUtQ==","fsize":59854,"resto":120366224,"id":"7zsIj91m","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120368060,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)21:05:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120366224\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120366224<\/a><br>you are whining about a literal boogeyman","time":1491786318,"resto":120366224,"id":"1x3s9aZG","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

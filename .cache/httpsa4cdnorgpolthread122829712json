All the stuff referenced in the book is worth checking out and try skimming some BoE Committee reports and notes<br>Or watch the MPs hearings they held with Carney.<br>Very interesting as he confirmed we have an asset bubble and that;s why he refuses to raise rates as it would crash the asset prices.<br>The MPs esp. that Tory lad from Croydon grilled him a bit saying prices and this situation for savers being shafted by low IRs was unsustainable.<br><br>It will happen. It will wipe the smile of those smug BTL twats. head over to property118 to see how they are crying and shitting themselves.","time":1493177315,"resto":122829712,"id":"HULBVi4C","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122836166,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)23:29:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122835966\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122835966<\/a>","filename":"tumblr_moxcgvJRxh1rsxo3uo1_400","ext":".gif","w":352,"h":240,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":85,"tim":1493177378177,"time":1493177378,"md5":"wqeDZFMEbyWKAZNOJ3J7ew==","fsize":1584335,"resto":122829712,"id":"HULBVi4C","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122836200,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)23:29:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"who \/canbarelyevenvisitbrit\/pol\/sinceYK<wbr>TDleft\/ here?","time":1493177395,"resto":122829712,"id":"0iYuxJad","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122836456,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)23:32:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Pu\u00dfe ruins Brit\/pol <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Pu\u00dfe renames Brit\/pol<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Pu\u00dfe uses picture not in or relating to Britain<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Pu\u00dfe uses proxy to talk to himself<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Pu\u00dfe lies about using proxy<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Pu\u00dfe destroys previous thread with links to look at me I&#039;m Pu\u00dfe thread<\/span><br>Please give one instance where Pu\u00dfe has added anything of substance to any thread.

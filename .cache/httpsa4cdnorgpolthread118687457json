Some people in the United States do not deserve the right to be citizens.<br>15th: Letting niggers vote has led only to degeneracy.<br>16th: Allows Congress to steal your money.<br>17th: Again, limits the idea of a state&#039;s sovereignty having representation.<br>18th: Literally got repealed.<br>19th: Letting women vote has again, led to degeneracy.<br>20th: Lame-duck sessions, need I say more?<br>21th: Literally had to repeal a fuck-up.<br>22nd: Do you have a good president? Well, too bad, you don&#039;t get him when you need him the next term.<br>23rd: Political establishment cronies get their votes recognized, putting candidates like HRC in the equation. Bad.<br>24th: Nah, you don&#039;t have to pay taxes to vote. Don&#039;t worry about that. Non-citizens and non-taxpayers should have the right to influence elections. Oh wait, that&#039;s retarded.<br>25th: Literally just a clarification amendment. This tradition was already in place and did not need a constitutional amendment.<br>26th: 18 is too young to vote. I don&#039;t want some retarded kids screaming &quot;SOCIALISM&quot; deciding my future.<br>27th: So if our congressmen end up being tyrannical bastards, we can&#039;t do anything about pulling them out of office via paygrade.<br><br>Seriously, who thought it was a good fucking idea to let anyone edit the constitution? It&#039;s led to nothing but degeneracy, embarrassment, chaos, and easier manipulation of the system.","filename":"boredpepe","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":600,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490730546408,"time":1490730546,"md5":"yWQQpemxCHGiahLwK\/2LEQ==","fsize":36078,"resto":0,"id":"oWRkfMBJ","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"is-it-just-me-or-did-the-allowance-of","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":118688109,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)15:54:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;not mentioning 1st and 2nd Amendment<\/span>","time":1490730883,"resto":118687457,"id":"Afbuqllb","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"}]}

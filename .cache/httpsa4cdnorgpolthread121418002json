Main character of the new trilogy being a chick, okay I can accept that its fine. Main character of a spinoff movie also a chick, kinda pushing it but okay. But now the player character for Battlefront 2 being some brown chick, and the new star wars cartoon advertised as completely focusing on the series heroines is just complete proof of it.<br>Not to mention Star Wars Rebels, which actually has two male main characters, is getting its final season already where its practically guaranteed they will die leaving the only male main characters being the old cast and their new diverse ones as the sole male influence in the series.","filename":"star-wars-forces-of-destiny-animated-series-slice-600x200","ext":".png","w":600,"h":200,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":41,"tim":1492380719510,"time":1492380719,"md5":"+bSjvY6TgkP+YG0mPtvp9Q==","fsize":161801,"resto":121418002,"id":"j3Oo5R4A","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121425431,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)18:13:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"Idk why people hate prequels, they are much better than newest girrrrrl power shit","time":1492380801,"resto":121418002,"id":"ukD5FVri","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":121425555,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)18:14:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121419214\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121419214<\/a><br>I agree, my man.

He also shows very little need for fighting in the first movies. He fights Obi-Wan because it is time for Obi-Wan to die. He fights Luke #1 to try to capture him, and fights Luke #2 to try to corrupt him by making him slay Vader (or the Emperor) in anger and thus embrace the dark side. <br><br>He wouldn&#039;t deign to get his hands dirty by killing a bunch of rebels. He also wouldn&#039;t care about making it a theatrical performance.","time":1492380871,"resto":121418002,"id":"rnt2yFyO","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

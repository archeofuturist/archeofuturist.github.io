It all depends on the culture surrounding the kids when they&#039;ll be ready for sex. In western civilization we raise our kids to be kids and shield them from as much reality and responsibility as possible because they might get hurt. This leads to some really immature and stupid adults hence the high age of consent. In places like the middle east or asian cultures where kids are treated more like adults but younger as is more traditional the age is naturally lower.","time":1490291957,"resto":117957475,"id":"jWihU4fj","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117960180,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)13:59:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117959494\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117959494<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;It&#039;s been shown in numerous studies that women are physically capable of birth one year after their first period, and that even children masturbate showing an interest in sexual things.<\/span><br>Having a sex-drive =\/= understanding the ramifications of engaging in sexual acts.

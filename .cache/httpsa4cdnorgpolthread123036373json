BTL landlords have taken advantage of this by getting progressively larger mortgage loans (to buy more property) and using rent intake to keep paying the interest off. The problem is once you start fucking with the numbers even slightly, this house of cards stops becoming profitable, leading to defaults, mass sell-offs etc.","time":1493304298,"resto":123036373,"id":"82dXqpL7","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"}]}

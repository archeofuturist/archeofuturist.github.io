The team was considered no longer combat effective.<br><br>Just like the Germans moved away from the more high power pistols like the C96 and moved to lighter decent models like the P38 and the Luger, the point of war is not to give your boys the best possible gun, it is to give them the most purpose fit gun. And for German infantry in most engagements, the most purpose fit gun was the Kar98k.<br>Also, it had a slightly longer effective firing range than the M1 grand, so I wouldn&#039;t say one is entirely better than the other.","time":1493188512,"resto":122851562,"id":"TnHO9FQv","country":"NZ","country_name":"New Zealand"},{"no":122854382,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)02:36:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122854160\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122854160<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;5.07<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;230 lbs<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;brown hair black eyes<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;USA<\/span><br>Is it a typical burger poster?","filename":"JUST","ext":".jpg","w":540,"h":540,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493188566252,"time":1493188566,"md5":"4EKvvLbI54CijKlrn6ftFw==","fsize":33516,"resto":122851562,"id":"+lewNDLl","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":122854418,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)02:36:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122854248\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122854248<\/a><br>I WON&#039;T CUM ON IT YOU FUCK","filename":"1487049188798","ext":".jpg","w":1200,"h":1600,"tn_w":93,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493188594850,"time":1493188594,"md5":"zREUifIJs+IM7dJt48GlDg==","fsize":371335,"resto":122851562,"id":"CFn6N\/YH","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":122854446,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)02:36:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122853395\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122853395<\/a><br>I guess if you want it for keepsake get the Luger, but if I was ever going to buy a rifle I&#039;d buy one that&#039;ll be useful, as in a modern rifle.<br><br><br>If I was allowed automatic weaponry might look into AUG, NZ army is trying to get rid of them so they might be going cheap here currently.","time":1493188608,"resto":122851562,"id":"TnHO9FQv","country":"NZ","country_name":"New Zealand"},{"no":122854461,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)02:37:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122854382\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122854382<\/a><br>yes","time":1493188623,"resto":122851562,"id":"6h08V23u","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122854496,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)02:37:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122851562\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122851562<\/a><br>Does anybody else use this site, is it biased?<br><br>https:\/\/plato.stanford.edu\/contents<wbr>.html","time":1493188645,"resto":122851562,"id":"fUoyV4EH","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":122854565,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)02:38:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122854160\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122854160<\/a><br><a href=\"#p122854248\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122854248<\/a><br><a href=\"#p122854170\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122854170<\/a><br><br>We&#039;re getting trolled by a \/k\/ meme","filename":"TopHeh","ext":".png","w":672,"h":585,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":108,"tim":1493188698576,"time":1493188698,"md5":"FXUHmdwU2m0eUNITD8q9TA==","fsize":133902,"resto":122851562,"id":"z1u0\/uG3","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122854593,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)02:38:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122854418\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122854418<\/a><br>You&#039;re really, really lucky that the infamous neo-nazi Bradley Christian Lester was in your thread to save it;

An egalitarian favors equality of some sort: People should get the same, or be treated the same, or be treated as equals, in some respect. An alternative view expands on this last-mentioned option: People should be treated as equals, should treat one another as equals, should relate as equals, or enjoy an equality of social status of some sort. Egalitarian doctrines tend to rest on a background idea that all human persons are equal in fundamental worth or moral status. So far as the Western European and Anglo-American philosophical tradition is concerned, one significant source of this thought is the Christian notion that God loves all human souls equally. Egalitarianism is a protean doctrine, because there are several different types of equality, or ways in which people might be treated the same, or might relate as equals, that might be thought desirable. In modern democratic societies, the term \u201cegalitarian\u201d is often used to refer to a position that favors, for any of a wide array of reasons, a greater degree of equality of income and wealth across persons than currently exists.<\/span><br><br>I figured if there was a bias we&#039;d find it on this page.

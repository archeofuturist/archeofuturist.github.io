You are currently the only country that can stage a full amphibian invasion of another country uncontested and you can shut down sea-borne trade which would cripple most countries.<br><br>You partially rely on NATO and other allies for both military know-how and power projection to supply your semi-raubwirtschaft (i.e. your economy is somewhat depending on stealing from other countries).<br><br>Conventional troops are well equipped, with top tier tech available, but not necessarily issued. War doctrine and experience frame is based on fighting enemies that cannot effectively retaliate against you and are often hopelessly outmatched.<br><br>The incestrous and corrupt connection between the military top brass and the private military industrial complex have caused massive damage in doctrines, equipment and training. You often misspent funds and a lot of decisions are based on commercial profit, not combat efficiency. Since you don&#039;t fight enemies your own strength, all these weaknesses are not noticed.<br><br>Effectively, if the US forces would ever fight an enemy somewhat close to their own power, they would suffer massively, as they are completely reliant on having 100% superiority in all areas. The moment one area (like air space) gets contested, your entire setup would risk folding upon itself like a house of cards. However, you would eventually recover and adapt, unless the enemy manages to deal a crippling blow to you first and the massive industrial capacities and manpower would suffocate most enemies or at least force a stand still.<br><br>E.g: The newest generation of german submarines are currently undetectable by any navy in the world.

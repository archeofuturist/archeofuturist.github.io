This is simply Israel-controlled America (via President Trumpstein) trying to reverse the success that Syria and Russia have had in removing the terrorists who have been fighting violently and incessantly for over half a decade now to end Syria&#039;s sovereignty to create Greater Israel. Most of these so-called &#039;moderate Syrian rebels&#039; used to be the so-called &#039;Libyan rebels&#039; (most of whom are not even Libyan, they come from Saudi Arabia and Turkey) who were fighting in Libya before Gaddafi was overthrown and killed. After Gaddafi was overthrown and killed, the so-called &#039;Libyan rebels&#039; moved into Syria, became the so-called &#039;moderate Syrian rebels&#039; (they&#039;ll rip your heart out and eat it, but don&#039;t worry, they&#039;ll do all of that &#039;moderately&#039;) and are now trying to overthrow (and kill) the secular leader of Syria - Assad. This war in Syria is a FRAUD and a FARCE. I am anti-Israel but I am NOT a Muslim. In fact, I am VERY anti-Islam, you don&#039;t need to be a Muslim to realise that Israel has hijacked the politics of the Western World (ESPECIALLY the Jewnited States of America). Assad is not a saint, but he&#039;s still INFINITELY BETTER than the Wahhabi lunatics that want to overthrow Assad to form their own shitty Islamic government in Syria.<br><br><a href=\"#p120618345\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120618345<\/a><br><br>Fuck off, Shlomo.","filename":"jewnitedstates","ext":".jpg","w":425,"h":240,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1491929409591,"time":1491929409,"md5":"qrdHJUS5lG1ydwl43iwnLA==","fsize":27351,"resto":120617832,"id":"EKyJ0+hJ","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":120620141,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)12:50:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"No proof, just like the last time he was framed then it turned out it was the rebels.<br><br>Plus, Assad has 0 reason to do something like, Israel and the neocons on the other hand have a reason.","time":1491929449,"resto":120617832,"id":"ywSRadQ0","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"},{"no":120620198,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)12:51:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120617832\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120617832<\/a><br><br>False flag media story.

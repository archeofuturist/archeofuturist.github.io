United States stands alone.<\/span><br><br>Look at the parallels. Russia is trying to corrupt Europe against one another, and backing candidates there and across the world which oppose NATO and the EU. China is suffering an impending food shortage and is buying farmland in nearby countries like Australia, so much so that Australia had to stop them from acquiring more. Russia has invaded its neighbors and has every intention of continuing to do so. Relations with Mexico are at a low. There&#039;s revolution in South American countries. <br><br>In the movie, they fly in soldiers in planes disguised as commercial airliners. Simultaneously they have spies who sabotage our ability to carry out a nuclear strike, which in our case could possibly be carried out somewhat from hacking. They nuke several major US cities. They invade the west and southern US. In this case, Russia and China both would likely cooperate. <br><br>And you know who is going to make all of this possible? <br><br>Donald Traitor Trump. And it won&#039;t be intentional, it&#039;ll just be because he&#039;s a hopelessly inept manchild who would sell his own daughter if the price was right.<br><br>I&#039;m a true patriot in the Appalachians, so when you Russian fags and Chinese fags come knocking, you better say your prayers and stay out of my mountains.","filename":"L169_CIFRe66b319ba2a4efbed743f38b734a5a9c","ext":".jpg","w":490,"h":275,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1492895400596,"time":1492895400,"md5":"hVjdnGz9C6XIWu1kiCoxBQ==","fsize":165756,"resto":0,"id":"kjYJciWV","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"red-dawn-is-real-life-waiting-to-happen","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

Grew up on a farm in the hills of North Georgia, know a thing or two about living in the woods and I&#039;m hoping that&#039;ll come in handy in gulag country.<br><br>https:\/\/game2winter.ru\/chad-bagwell<wbr><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/xvtwHIpNuFA<br><br>Beyond the hope of winning the game and some of the prize money, I like to see myself as a sort of peace envoy to the Russians; prove that not all Americans are decadent, burger-munching neocon morons. I think I&#039;d be a good candidate as a peace envoy since, well, I&#039;m pretty much the quintessential Trump supporter: rural white working-class Protestant male millennial from the Deep South who&#039;s parents and grandparents were all Reagan Democrats. Fond of Putin, don&#039;t really care about Syria, hoping Russia wipes out the scum who blew up that subway of theirs...<br><br>...what do y&#039;all say? Looking forward to Dukes of Hazzard meets the Gulag Archipelago?

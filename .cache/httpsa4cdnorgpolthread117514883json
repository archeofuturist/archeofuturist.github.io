I only said the reverse certainly isn&#039;t possible. Secondly, most Fennoswedes are descendants of Swedes who settled there just 300 years ago, and they are mixed with the local population. Swedes have ruled Finland for a thousand years. Look at the attached picture. Roughly 1 quarter of all Finns belong to the haplogroup I1, rarely found outside of Scandinavia, and the same proportions of I1 to R1a and R1b groups as Sweden, and these groups have been part of the Swedish gene pool for &gt;3000 years. Clearly, this admixture comes from Sweden. Roughly 40% of Finnish DNA is Swedish, at least on the Y chromosome (so either 40% mixed or 40% rape babies). Now look at the Swedish side. Less than 10% belong to the haplogroup N, which is the most common group in Finland.

In some cases this is very accurate. A lot of Indians are narcissistic and EXTREMELY pretentious.<br><br>I used to have an Indian guy in my friend circle and he was so mentally subnormal and disliked that everyone cut him out of the group. We didn&#039;t even organise it, we all individually despised him and blanked him at once naturally. He thought he was a genius and would actually say so all the time. He was so dumb but he would try to start debates all the time that just made no sense. <br><br>When you see the circular psuedo philosophical nonsense &#039;wisdom&#039; of Indian gurus you can really see how damaging it is to the culture and people.

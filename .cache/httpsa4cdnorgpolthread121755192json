We are still living in the fallout of this mode of thinking, <br>as the people who espoused these ideas when young have grown to adulthood and are <br>now the \u201cestablishment\u201d \u2014 those adults whom they considered to be the enemy during the <br>sixties. This \u201cegalitarianism\u201d was manifested in cultural domains with concepts such as <br>\u201cAnything can be defined as being art and all such works must be considered to have <br>equal validity.\u201d Thus, some random splashes on a canvas were considered an equal <br>achievement to the Sistine Chapel; a mud hut was held up as being equivalent to <br>Versailles. A janitor was dubbed the equivalent to a physicist; a novelist was now the <br>peer of one who scrawled graffiti on a bathroom wall. This principle of <br>\u201cindiscrimination\u201d was applied to all other fields of achievement. Those who opposed <br>this leveling were accused of being \u201cfascists\u201d or \u201cNazis,\u201d without regard for what these <br>terms might have meant in their actual historical origins and practice. After all, it was the <br>mid-sixties, twenty years after the ending of a war that most of these folks weren\u2019t even <br>alive to have experienced. How quickly past orthodoxies are forgotten.&quot; - Peter H Gilmore","filename":"peter-gilmore-sword-lg","ext":".jpg","w":400,"h":551,"tn_w":181,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492555870483,"time":1492555870,"md5":"Fh3fLlYFUCGMV1coQufi\/g==","fsize":34355,"resto":0,"id":"KYp6q\/x8","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"in-the-1960s-the-radical-left-preached-a","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

Talked to my mother about this and the general consensus among Japanese people is that they lost the war and deserve everything they get as the loser. They should not have entered if they were going to lose.<br><br> Theres a ton of ideas floating around as well that the Japanese knew the war was lost years before they actually surrendered. I remember when watching grave of the fireflies there are scenes that show Japanese bourgeoisie admitting loss and the MC was like &quot;whaaat!!&quot; That could be some western influence to stop the Japanese people from ever wanting an army again so they cant lose again. Just an idea, no sources.","time":1493735932,"resto":123770778,"id":"V0QQnhsg","country":"HK","country_name":"Hong Kong"}]}

The Chinese government makes California look like Texas. Furthermore, they risk IP theft virtually at all times. Bootleg products aren&#039;t just iPhones and luxury handbags, but full on cars and other consumer durables as well. Finally, there&#039;s always the risk of nationalization. This isn&#039;t really present in China, but you can be kicked out at a moment&#039;s notice. Think more so the General Motors plant in Venezuela though. On top of all these risks, you have shipping costs that have to get paid. <br><br>However, the cheap labor of these countries typically covers these costs. But if we in the West automated our manufacturing facilities, would we still be able to maintain a competitive edge over the rest of the world in manufacturing? <br><br>For instance, Japan and Germany both have massive manufacturing industries, but they aren&#039;t working for peanuts. They have highly skilled workforces and are the cutting-edge of the technological industry. Yes, Japan does have some benefit from currency manipulation and the same is true of Germany, but currency manipulation isn&#039;t everything, after all, if that were true then Zimbabwe should theoretically be a global powerhouse. So could automation make us a manufacturing leader again?","filename":"automation ","ext":".jpg","w":277,"h":182,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":164,"tim":1493619846781,"time":1493619846,"md5":"rDUeXLhfM+jZE3PYvD1jOA==","fsize":18175,"resto":0,"id":"VMhlCMA4","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"is-automation-the-solution-to-our-manufacturing","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":1,"unique_ips":3},{"no":123587976,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)02:25:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123587854\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123587854<\/a><br><br>It ain&#039;t gonna bring back millions of jobs tho","time":1493619937,"resto":123587854,"id":"nv1mVKMc","country":"AR","country_name":"Argentina"},{"no":123588891,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)02:37:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123587854\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123587854<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;mfw rape factories<\/span>","filename":"Kleo","ext":".png","w":1516,"h":1080,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":89,"tim":1493620666804,"time":1493620666,"md5":"bqjX3fiUT4VP89OzeAYDrw==","fsize":1032203,"resto":123587854,"id":"GRbIrvBa","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"}]}

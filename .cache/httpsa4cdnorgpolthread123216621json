In contrast to pacifism, the non-aggression principle does not preclude violent self-defense.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; BDSM: a variety of often erotic practices or roleplaying involving bondage, discipline, dominance and submission, sadomasochism, and other related interpersonal dynamics.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Self-ownership: the concept of property in one&#039;s own person, expressed as the moral or natural right of a person to have bodily integrity, and be the exclusive controller of her or his own body and life.<\/span><br><br>Given that individuals own their bodies, and all humans act, it follows that individuals may also decide what to do with their bodies. In the context of relationships, individuals may choose to freely associate with one another, negotiating the terms of their engagement. In the case of BDSM, one may willingly consent to anything, so long as it is freely chosen. Thus an individual may consent to activities which would otherwise violate the NAP, as they are freely chosen by the individual. Hitting, spitting, insulting, forced actions, and control of another person&#039;s body are all permissible so long as the top fulfills their part of the contract. Given that consent cannot be retroactively revoked after an event has occurred, it is wise for both the bottom and the top to clearly stipulate their terms and conditions before agreeing to any contract. A common element of such contracts is the idea of a safe word, which is the right of the top or the bottom to cease any activity at any time through the use of a safe word. The emergence of this kind of standard practice is evidence of the free market at work, as those who refuse to abide by this principle are not desirable partners in the BDSM scene, and are rejected.","filename":"Hereslookingatyoukid","ext":".jpg","w":400,"h":300,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1493399303409,"time":1493399303,"md5":"KIc10dYphzKGMXpIukMP7w==","fsize":29938,"resto":123216621,"id":"i1H7hC7u","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123217146,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)13:11:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123216621\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123216621<\/a><br><a href=\"#p123216795\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123216795<\/a><br>Hello, Stefan, I hope you&#039;re doing well.","time":1493399488,"resto":123216621,"id":"8kDpY7UX","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123217286,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)13:12:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123217146\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123217146<\/a><br>spbp","time":1493399560,"resto":123216621,"id":"5IxCuHBM","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123217423,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)13:13:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123217146\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123217146<\/a><br>I wish.","filename":"stefan_molymeme","ext":".jpg","w":300,"h":170,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1493399633483,"time":1493399633,"md5":"aDqecQYxa2ow8Kw7UUgTjw==","fsize":8920,"resto":123216621,"id":"i1H7hC7u","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123218826,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)13:26:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123217146\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123217146<\/a><br>A typical agreement might look something like this:<br>I, ___X___ agree to provide the following services to ____Y____ from (date) to (date) unless terminated.

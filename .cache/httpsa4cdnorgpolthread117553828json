These are all as I understand them, so anyone who can correct me, feel free.<br><br>1) There&#039;s never been a model to accurately predict the rise in global temperatures. Even errors of a degree or two centigrade are enormous when talking about the size of the temperature rise. Additionally, the Climategate Wikileaks and other leakers have shown that the data is regularly scrubbed after the fact to fit the narrative. The models themselves are fairly primative as well as they require huge amounts of processing power for the computational fluid modeling, heat transfer, mass transfer, etc. Grid sizes in the kilometers are not uncommon. <br><br>2. Carbon-based warming occurs on a logarithmic scale. Carbon also makes up a tiny percentage of the greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere (the largest of which I believe is actually water vapor). Predictions of catastrophic warming due to a feedback loop of increased carbon = increased water vapor are, as far as I know, unsubstantiated and have not been accurately predicted. Regarding the logarithmic warming by carbon, that means each additional carbon atom added warms the atmosphere less than the previous one. <br><br>3. On a long enough geological scale (i.e. not just since the 1800&#039;s as the climate graphs always show), we&#039;ve been coming out of an ice age for a while. It&#039;s not a surprise that over time the temperature has risen. Most people don&#039;t doubt that. What they do doubt is how much humans actually impact it.<br><br>4. Increased carbon content in the air can actually be a good thing. It&#039;s plant food, and more plants means more food for us, which we&#039;ll need to stave off global hunger as the population rises. Additionally, times of higher carbon density tend to be the most biodiverse. A quick google search shows that the dinosaurs breathed air with about 5x as much carbon dioxide as now.","filename":"climate change 1","ext":".png","w":3683,"h":1413,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":47,"tim":1490059341208,"time":1490059341,"md5":"SWIyGsvpGIRrDYDddNP84g==","fsize":428868,"resto":117553828,"id":"rGnKFXie","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117566481,"now":"03\/20\/17(Mon)21:29:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117565637\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117565637<\/a><br>(con&#039;t)<br><br>5. The 97% meme is apparently bullshit. What defines a &quot;climate scientist&quot; in the surveys that were done is pretty much anyone who says they are, which logically would be the people most inclined to look favorably on the climate change meme. <br><br>6. Renewables, for all the hype around them, almost always have to be backed up by fossil based generators. When a solar plant or wind plant stops producing, people still expect their power to be on. So to maintain the load demands, we back them up with gas turbines or diesels that, because they are not operating continuously, are less efficient with higher emissions.<br><br>7. The benefits of the cheap, efficient, scaleable, reliable energy that fossil fuels, and only fossil fuels at the moment provide, far outweigh the risks of future climate issues. The quality of life for people is directly related to their country&#039;s use of fossil fuels. People are safer from the environment as more fossil fuels are used because we are better able to control our local climate.","time":1490059741,"resto":117553828,"id":"rGnKFXie","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117568155,"now":"03\/20\/17(Mon)21:43:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117566481\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117566481<\/a><br>nice effort post. thanks","time":1490060588,"resto":117553828,"id":"o44LhYGw","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117568364,"now":"03\/20\/17(Mon)21:44:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"You don&#039;t do research without grant funding, when you write a grant you write what the people with the money want to read.

I think FDR might be the worst of all time due to literally seizing private businesses, internment camps, trying to rig the supreme court, and also did the exact opposite of what he campaigned for (said he would spend less, instead spent everything).<br><br>But for the modern presidents, and considering most people won&#039;t know who FDR even is, I think Trump will be the worst one. People hate Bush, people hate Obama, but now Trump is hated by the left AND by his own core constituents. Some in the media may be sucking up to him now, but the left still despises him. If he does put troops in Syria, it&#039;s all over. <br><br>Even ann coulter doesn&#039;t seem to think he&#039;s gonna build the wall anymore, and neither do I. One of the selling points of Trump was that he had to keep his promises, or he&#039;d just be trashed. He seems to have forgotten that. Left or right, both sides are tired of war, even if the politicians aren&#039;t. <br><br>I&#039;m really starting to hate America. I feel like everyone is just waiting for it to fail, on both sides.

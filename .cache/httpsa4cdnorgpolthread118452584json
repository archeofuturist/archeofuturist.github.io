It was the result of multiple parties seeking different objectives. You can&#039;t take the situation into account without including Germany because Germany was the catalyst. <br><br>The British saw the League of Nations failing as one nation after another fell to what was seen at the time as unwarranted aggression. Italy took Ethiopia, Spain was torn apart by civil war that was supported by the Germans and Italians, Germany took Austria, Germany negotiated away the Sudetenland from the Czech&#039;s and then invaded the rest of the country shortly afterwards. All of these diplomatic failings on the part of the British and French culminated into drawing a final line in the sand at Poland.<br><br>The crazy part about Poland is that before this the Polish government wasn&#039;t all that unsympathetic towards the Germans and the German government had even discussed the idea of allying with the Poles. <br><br>The truth of the matter is that much like the first war, the second world war was the result of failures in diplomacy and communication. That and the rest of Europe was unwilling to accede to what was seen as unwarranted German aggression. <br><br>I know some Naziboos will probably come in here with their poorly sourced infographics but the truth of the matter is that without Germany, and particularly without Hitler and the Nazi party, you don&#039;t have a second world war plain and simple.","time":1490579639,"resto":118452584,"id":"7Ohu2C9\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

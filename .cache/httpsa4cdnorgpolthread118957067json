Blumpf is literally HITLER reincarnated and will shortly begin killing everyone who opposes him, most likely because he has tiny hands and needs to overcompensate due to his MAJOR deficiencies. Did you hear on CNN that cheetos face only won because a team of Russian spies, personally led by Vladimir Putin, let all the air out of the tires of Hillary voters so they literally couldn&#039;t vote in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania. These Russians are pure evil. Like there was a report that someone who worked for Trump had a deal with someone in Russia at some point in the past, so I know that literally means Putin hacked the election and personally changed the outcome. We are literally at war with Russia right now. We need to find out who in the government is sympathetic to or literally working with the Russians right now. We need hearings and investigations to root out all these people, and we need loyalty tests for everyone. Hell there could be MILLIONS of Russian sympathizers or spies in the government right, at least that&#039;s what Buzzfeed told me this morning. Why this small handed orange Hitler wasn&#039;t impeached 5 minutes after he took office is baffling to say the least. I&#039;m LITERALLY shaking right now at the thought of him destroying the planet. It&#039;s hilarious watching him crash and burn, but in all seriousness, we can&#039;t let this monster get the nuclear codes.

More evidence is such as grant would not have fought for the union if he thought the war was about slavery -- Lincoln&#039;s emancipation only outlawed slavery in the south, so grant kept his slaves. Lee didnt own slaves for more than 10 years before the war. When captured confederate soldiers were questioned about their motives, many would reply &quot;You invaded us&quot; less than i believe it was 8% of the white southern population owned slaves, yet a majority of free southern blacks owned slaves... etc. Only a real retard who doesnt know jack about the civil war thinks it&#039;s cause was slavery","time":1493673164,"resto":123672194,"id":"1XLyS\/Jn","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123674110,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)17:14:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123672194\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123672194<\/a><br>only in the halls of congress was it about slavery<br><br>to the Southern fighters it was to repel northern aggression, they didn&#039;t tell their southern slaves the north wanted to free them.<br><br>in the North it was about the South rebelling against the constitution","filename":"pol wendys","ext":".jpg","w":572,"h":1000,"tn_w":71,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493673271901,"time":1493673271,"md5":"oSkt1c\/xrUIJ3+G+CptbRA==","fsize":195587,"resto":123672194,"id":"OUgOWgCR","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

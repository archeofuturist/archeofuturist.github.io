The traitors wanted this false flag to push Trump into war, and Trump knew this. Instead he destroyed an airfield and killed a measly 6 people. Not the reaction the establishment had hoped for... but it was something. The reason it is important that Trump actually conducted a military strike on Syria over this information is because now he has a hot situation where intel can be gathered about who was involved in planning this.

WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU RUNNING FROM? You&#039;ll tell anyone who listens you&#039;re &quot;Syrian&quot;, as if you actually have PRIDE for your shithole. If you do, great! Go fight for it your fucking selves! <br><br>Who are you REALLY running away from? ISIS\/Rebels? Turks? Kurds? Assad? We don&#039;t hear enough from Syrians about what the real issue is and no one can trust the Jew owned media. So tell us Syrians, what the ever loving fuck is sooooo scary, your MEN would rather RUN than fight. You look like pussdicks, begging for food, shelter, clothes and money. <br><br>Allah would shit on you for fleeing like pussdicks, so why are you running?!","filename":"image","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":480,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1493212368432,"time":1493212368,"md5":"FpHIK34c5sVG5LokuhA6lg==","fsize":95501,"resto":0,"id":"B3kzAut1","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"calling-all-syrians-hurry-up-and-get-in-here","country_name":"United States","replies":7,"images":1,"unique_ips":5},{"no":122882398,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)09:17:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122882053\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122882053<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;why are unarmed civilians not fighting a fully-equipped Army and Airforce armed to the teeth with chemical and cluster bombs <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Amerifat education on full display<\/span><br>SHART","filename":"1491285507317","ext":".webm","w":1280,"h":720,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1493212633678,"time":1493212633,"md5":"CeGhQtIeqLZVh8k4cZCi6A==","fsize":1533198,"resto":122882053,"id":"47o0dx0Z","country":"IN","country_name":"India"},{"no":122882449,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)09:17:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122882053\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122882053<\/a><br>They&#039;re running go countries that not only welcome them with open arms, but have government (tax payer funded) free living waiting for them too.

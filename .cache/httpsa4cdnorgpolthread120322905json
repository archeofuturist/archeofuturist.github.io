They don&#039;t bring questions and discussions. They just use physical force or loud noise to make it impossible for anyone else to talk.<br><br>So I&#039;m going to turn the tables on them. On April 22, the leftists will be having a nationwide &quot;March for Science,&quot; which is really a &quot;March against Trump.&quot; I know their plans for my city, and I am going to stop them from having their event.<br><br>I plan to use asymmetric tactics to do this.<br><br>The event will be a march followed by speakers. My plan is to get in the middle of the crowd when the speakers start and begin reading out loud nonstop from a children&#039;s book (Beverly Cleary&#039;s &quot;Beezus and Ramona&quot;). I will read in a somewhat loud voice, but not yelling. My voice itself will not be loud enough to drown out the speakers. But those near me will start shouting at me to get me to stop, and their noise will drown out the speaker. I plan to continue reading until they leave or until I am foricibly removed from the area. It will be a test of my hypothesis that one man can completely shut down an event.<br><br>There are no antifa in my area, so I don&#039;t have to worry about violence.<br><br>I disrupted the Women&#039;s March back in January, but I was not prepared enough, so my disruption was incomplete. This time it will be complete and total, and the event will not take place unless I am physically removed.<br><br>I don&#039;t know if I will try to stream that. Would anyone be interested in watching me stream it?<br><br>I&#039;m just letting you know in case some of you want to do the same thing.<br><br>Freedom of speech for all, or freedom of speech for no one. If they shut us down, we should shut them down.<br><br>Tips:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;If you wear a MAGA hat, use rope to secure it to your belt.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Bring water.

First, the day she died was the same day Assange supposedly vanished. Secondly, her death is somewhat similar to that of Assanges barrister, John Jones QC, who jumped in front of a train within hours of leaving a psychiatric hospital. Mariana Pinto jumped off of a building within 24 hours of leaving a psychiatric hospital as well, and her coroners report states the reason for this is &quot;cannabis withdrawal&quot;.<br><br>The coroner who examined Mariana Pinto was Mary Hassell, who also happened to be the coroner for John Jones QC as well as the Vice President of JPMorgan London, Gabriel Magee, who also fell off a building under suspicious circumstances. All three of these deaths were ruled not to be suspicious by Mary Hassell.<br><br>http:\/\/wallstreetonparade.com\/2016\/<wbr>10\/banker-deaths-and-wikileaks-deat<wbr>hs-have-a-common-thread\/<br><br>It may also be worth noting that the footage of John Jones QC jumping in front of a train was not allowed to be viewed by a jury because it was deemed to be &quot;too disturbing&quot;. <br><br>These threads went on for a long time without gaining much momentum when suddenly someone appeared, posting only once, offering us a &quot;second piece of the puzzle&quot;.

The hint takes us to Black Cube, and Israeli Intelligence Company. Lieutenenat Colonel E.J. could have been the person to plan and set everything in motion the past few years of violence. During Obama&#039;s term he kept BTFO Israel every chance he could. That is when Black Cube was enlisted to hack and leak the information to WL going back to 2010. Afghan, Iraq, and Cablegate were all done by Black Cube under the direction of EJ. Then 2016 election season comes around knowing Hillary would continue Obama&#039;s policies it would eternally BTFO Israel if she won. That is when EJ and Black Cube hacked the DNC to end it. Remember how bad it was for Israel especially when Obama humiliated them in the last month of his presidency. <br><br>All this drama with WL is due to Black Cube being behind the curtain.

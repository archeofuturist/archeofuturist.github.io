First, the day she died was the same day Assange supposedly vanished. Secondly, her death is somewhat similar to that of Assanges barrister, John Jones QC, who jumped in front of a train within hours of leaving a psychiatric hospital. Mariana Pinto jumped off of a building within 24 hours of leaving a psychiatric hospital as well, and her coroners report states the reason for this is &quot;cannabis withdrawal&quot;.<br><br>The coroner who examined Mariana Pinto was Mary Hassell, who also happened to be the coroner for John Jones QC as well as the Vice President of JPMorgan London, Gabriel Magee, who also fell off a building under suspicious circumstances. All three of these deaths were ruled not to be suspicious by Mary Hassell.<br><br>http:\/\/wallstreetonparade.com\/2016\/<wbr>10\/banker-deaths-and-wikileaks-deat<wbr>hs-have-a-common-thread\/<br><br>It may also be worth noting that the footage of John Jones QC jumping in front of a train was not allowed to be viewed by a jury because it was deemed to be &quot;too disturbing&quot;. <br><br>These threads went on for a long time without gaining much momentum when suddenly someone appeared, posting only once, offering us a &quot;second piece of the puzzle&quot;.

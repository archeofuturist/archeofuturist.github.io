I&#039;ve had places say I was a bit over dressed but hired me regardless.","time":1491934172,"resto":120622640,"id":"mxZhrQe1","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120630473,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)14:09:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120625326\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120625326<\/a><br>As someone who used to deal with constant shit at a grocery store for 35 hours a week with only one day off, I feel ya.

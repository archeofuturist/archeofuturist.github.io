Then, a period of class struggle follows in which the capitalist class is liquidated by the working class. When the capitalist class has been completely vanquished, there will be only one class, the working class, and eventually the functions of the state will become indistinguishable from the functions of the society as a whole, and the state as such will &#039;wither away&#039; as Marx said.<\/span><br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/ma<wbr>rx\/works\/1847\/11\/prin-com.htm<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/ma<wbr>rx\/works\/1848\/communist-manifesto\/<br><br>ML uses a philosophy called dialectical materialism, see here:<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/reference\/<wbr>archive\/stalin\/works\/1938\/09.htm<br><br>It is recommended that you read some of the critical works of Marxism-Leninism so you can make an informed assessment of the ideology.<br><br>Resources:<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/ma<wbr>rx\/works\/sw\/<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/le<wbr>nin\/works\/sw\/<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/reference\/<wbr>archive\/stalin\/works\/decades-index.<wbr>htm<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/reference\/<wbr>archive\/mao\/selected-works\/<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/ma<wbr>rx\/works\/1884\/origin-family\/<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/le<wbr>nin\/works\/1914\/mar\/11.htm","filename":"1481244074852","ext":".png","w":1010,"h":1010,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491950972742,"time":1491950972,"md5":"676S1nirnOI5InkeibSxFw==","fsize":177742,"resto":0,"id":"2iCWB7H7","country":"ES","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"pol-communism-general","country_name":"Spain","replies":14,"images":9,"unique_ips":6},{"no":120671786,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)18:51:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"Let&#039;s me be the first to sage this post","time":1491951100,"resto":120671500,"id":"v5dqp+Sq","country":"IT","country_name":"Italy"},{"no":120672031,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)18:53:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120671786\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120671786<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Let&#039;s me be the first to sage this post<\/span><br><br>Thanks for the plants comrade","filename":"3b8ce52301ae77727dc28592a878df5f","ext":".jpg","w":236,"h":274,"tn_w":107,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491951209007,"time":1491951209,"md5":"K9yWJ1uWhC6gSf8kffrhYw==","fsize":17868,"resto":120671500,"id":"2iCWB7H7","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":120672492,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)18:56:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120671500\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120671500<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Won WWII against Nazi Germany<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Couldn&#039;t win the Cold War<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The Cold War was won simply by not collapsing<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;claims to be anti-imperialist, yet the Soviet Union invaded half of Europe<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Nazi concentration camps were based on Soviet gulags<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Claims to be anti-racist, yet Maoist China committed ethno-genocide<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Cambodia committed world&#039;s first auto-genocide<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;China now has the world&#039;s largest economy simply because they flat-out abandoned communism in the 70s<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;commies are the biggest Islamic apologists<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In based China, Muslims are oppressed<\/span>","filename":"welles","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":617,"tn_w":101,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491951411357,"time":1491951411,"md5":"1LMnOIVkDeoAt43wNRfGRg==","fsize":90774,"resto":120671500,"id":"YRrCLpyh","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120672580,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)18:57:24","name":"Anonymous","filename":"17156355_1293033830733502_4223352045968155741_n","ext":".png","w":480,"h":402,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":104,"tim":1491951444874,"time":1491951444,"md5":"af7ugO0i2CGSHRLaIuLy3g==","fsize":174114,"resto":120671500,"id":"2iCWB7H7","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":120673138,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)19:01:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120672580\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120672580<\/a><br><br>Yes, in full automated gay space communism, nobody will ever have to work, ever.

Nobody has a clue what the population of what is now DRCongo was before the foundation of the Congo Free State.<br><br>The atrocities were invented and the crimes of a few nigger mercenaries hired to enforce rubber production quotas, acting against the orders of their white officers, were blown out of proportion by a globalist-controlled Belgian government whose paymasters wanted the Congo for themselves. <br><br>Leopold brought Christianity to the Congo and the Congo into the modern world---or as far as it&#039;s ever likely to be brought while it&#039;s still inhabited mostly by niggers.<br><br>The Congo &quot;genocide&quot; is a figment of globalist imagination. It never happened.<br><br>The Armenian genocide and Jewish Holocaust, meanwhile, were all too real, and are exhaustively documented. Today only Islamist scumbags like Erdogan deny that Turks murdered Armenians in their millions, simply because Armenians were Christians and had nicer things than Turks did (because Turks were Muslims and a Turkish woman only denied her husband sex if she wanted her throat cut). <br><br>Ataturk was not worthy to eat Leopold&#039;s shit.","filename":"Leopold_ii_garter_knight","ext":".jpg","w":695,"h":1041,"tn_w":83,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491181836361,"time":1491181836,"md5":"TskfqNluWezJogo6x6GDbA==","fsize":139331,"resto":119265602,"id":"UrrWKCwQ","country":"CA","m_img":1,"country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119272002,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)21:11:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119269542\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119269542<\/a><br>I wouldn&#039;t say best, but it&#039;s a tried and true formula.","time":1491181862,"resto":119265602,"id":"n\/ciMrzD","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119272041,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)21:11:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119267721\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119267721<\/a><br>That&#039;s why you have a constitutional Monarchy.","time":1491181880,"resto":119265602,"id":"UiO66egj","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119272225,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)21:13:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119269303\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119269303<\/a><br><br>Very well done flyer indeed.","time":1491182000,"resto":119265602,"id":"Vu8YZyhG","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119272255,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)21:13:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119267112\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119267112<\/a><br>Kek<br><br><a href=\"#p119265602\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119265602<\/a><br>It&#039;s because they killed Congolese.

Why?","com":"What are \/pol\/&#039;s views on carrying a switchblade in your pocket?<br><br>I&#039;ve carried a knife since I was five years old. It was a shitty knife, one of those with a 1.75&quot; blade, nail file and bottle opener, but a knife nonetheless. Sure, I cut myself once as a kid, but only after some little snot-nosed bastard who had never been allowed to handle one excitedly grabbed at it and tried to snatch it from me, but I never injured myself or anyone else with it.<br><br>Now I carry an automatic, front-opening Microtech switchblade. (picture very similar, but mine has a bayonet-style blade) I&#039;ve never used it out of aggression or had to defend myself with it, but I use it in a utility fashion at least daily. I keep it hair-splitting sharp. I use a leather strop and polishing compound. You can literally shave your face with it, but it&#039;s not fun.<br><br>What does \/pol\/ think? Do you think these knives are more dangerous than any other knife? Do you believe they&#039;re illegal still for a good reason?","filename":"aaaaa11","ext":".jpg","w":2048,"h":1536,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1492711992497,"time":1492711992,"md5":"X7JFpJmEzYcVT4Z2X\/tR9g==","fsize":760156,"resto":0,"id":"lxYJQSD4","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"should-switchblades-or-knives-be-illegal-to-carry","country_name":"United States","replies":4,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":122022380,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)14:17:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"i carry a fixed blade ka-bar replica in a sheath.<br>not sure about the legality, but i would honestly feel terrified to leave the house without it.<br>only started carrying since gun crime in my area skyrocketed, it has become a reality to be robbed at gunpoint or even shot in AUSTRALIA these days.","time":1492712224,"resto":122021907,"id":"1h97QJ5G","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":122022915,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)14:21:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122022380\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122022380<\/a><br>Wow!

I was watching a stupid cop show where the police was watching the big brother cameras for small infractions, and half of the people arrested made the mistake of momentarily exposing a pocket knife to open a letter or something. I think they can carry a folding, non-locking pocketknife with a 1&quot; blade or less, or something useless like that. Be careful down there. If they&#039;re illegal, the British cops hunted down pocket knives like they were drug runners.","time":1492712789,"resto":122021907,"id":"lxYJQSD4","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

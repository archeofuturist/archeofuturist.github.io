Why?","com":"What are \/pol\/&#039;s views on carrying a switchblade in your pocket?<br><br>I&#039;ve carried a knife since I was five years old. It was a shitty knife, one of those with a 1.75&quot; blade, nail file and bottle opener, but a knife nonetheless. Sure, I cut myself once as a kid, but only after some little snot-nosed bastard who had never been allowed to handle one excitedly grabbed at it and tried to snatch it from me, but I never injured myself or anyone else with it.<br><br>Now I carry an automatic, front-opening Microtech switchblade. (picture very similar, but mine has a bayonet-style blade) I&#039;ve never used it out of aggression or had to defend myself with it, but I use it in a utility fashion at least daily. I keep it hair-splitting sharp. I use a leather strop and polishing compound. You can literally shave your face with it, but it&#039;s not fun.<br><br>What does \/pol\/ think?

Pre-charge characteristics, including arrest offense and criminal history, can explain about 80% of these disparities, but substantial gaps remain across the distribution. On average, blacks receive almost 10% longer sentences than comparable whites arrested for the same crimes. At least half this gap can be explained by initial charging choices, particularly the filing of charges carrying mandatory minimum sentences. Prosecutors are, ceteris paribus, almost twice as likely to file such charges against blacks.<\/span><br><br><a href=\"#p119113187\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119113187<\/a><br>https:\/\/papers.ssrn.com\/sol3\/papers<wbr>.cfm?abstract_id=2144002<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;This paper assesses gender disparities in federal criminal cases. It finds large gender gaps favoring women throughout the sentence length distribution (averaging over 60%), conditional on arrest offense, criminal history, and other pre-charge observables. Female arrestees are also significantly likelier to avoid charges and convictions entirely, and twice as likely to avoid incarceration if convicted. Prior studies have reported much smaller sentence gaps because they have ignored the role of charging, plea-bargaining, and sentencing fact-finding in producing sentences. Most studies control for endogenous severity measures that result from these earlier discretionary processes and use samples that have been winnowed by them. I avoid these problems by using a linked dataset tracing cases from arrest through sentencing. Using decomposition methods, I show that most sentence disparity arises from decisions at the earlier stages, and use the rich data to investigate causal theories for these gender gaps.<\/span>","time":1491002098,"resto":119110037,"id":"nps1C\/b3","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119113334,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)19:15:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119110037\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119110037<\/a><br><br>Did your professor take into account prior convictions and how they affect sentences?<br><br>Did your professor also take into account socioeconomic status and how only being able to afford a public defender vs a full legal team affect sentences?","time":1491002102,"resto":119110037,"id":"VfkdvETs","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119113355,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)19:15:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119110037\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119110037<\/a><br>Does this account for previous offences?

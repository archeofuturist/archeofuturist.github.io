Assad might not be perfect, but he cares for his people and his people support him. I interviewed both a pilot who defected and a tank driver that, I hope, is still alive. The pilot wasn&#039;t a bad guy, but definitely left due to foreign influence. A turkish agent helped him get out. The tank driver was a young dude that sounded like an old man rhetorically. He has christian relatives and friends that he feels will die if the rebels win the war. I was privy to a few photos, not tweeted, sent to me by some anon soldiers. The pics showed a cache of TOW missiles with serial numbers tracing to Saudi stock, delivered through Turkey to the northern units of the FSA. Unfortunately for Syrians, the majority of the FSA, particularly near the border, are nothing but proxies for ISIS. They maintain smaller warbands but survive in the shadow of ISIS by leaving these TOW missile caches for them to find. In return, they are permitted to live and have passage through Daesh territory. The final pill on Syria was from interviewing former pipeline workers that don&#039;t have jobs now. They had a good thing going, but the West won&#039;t let them be. They want to deny the Syrian oil and gas lines to make a monopoly for the Sheiks","time":1492042233,"resto":120815667,"id":"1BLYsn0Q","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120835495,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)20:12:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120834387\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120834387<\/a><br>You are what you accuse others of being.

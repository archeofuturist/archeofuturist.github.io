It had been brewing for awhile but most of us didn&#039;t know. For me personally, the USA election fundamentally changed my life. Now I can&#039;t wait to start a big family and be elected Senator and be a cultural contributor to my society, and so much more! If I had to pinpoint it all to one thing it 10\/10 would be Trump; thank you so much Mr. President. Let&#039;s take a \/thread\/ to remember the good times we had and share stories if you will. I&#039;ll kick it off with this nice old video from 2015.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=hb<wbr>ZoakVU2uo<\/span>","filename":"1475384578135","ext":".jpg","w":1200,"h":800,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1493273528767,"time":1493273528,"md5":"KBbVP8ViFzGZwjLjJvMsqQ==","fsize":93721,"resto":0,"id":"bwC+LEo8","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"n-o-s-t-a-l-g-i-a","country_name":"United States","replies":3,"images":3,"unique_ips":1},{"no":123004881,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)02:26:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"It was fucking crazy when Mexico randomly invited Trump and Hillary over. Of course Hillary didn&#039;t go and of course Trump owned it. That was a fun day, AND watching Trump then continue to another rally. I&#039;m convinced noone will ever have rallies as great as Trump&#039;s. I hope you got to go to one, anons.","filename":"ct-donald-trump-mexico-president-meeting-20160831","ext":".jpg","w":1050,"h":591,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1493274360064,"time":1493274360,"md5":"FvZo\/U2W2fuDGSmS7F3raQ==","fsize":54345,"resto":123003795,"id":"bwC+LEo8","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":123005568,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)02:33:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"I remember watching this happen.

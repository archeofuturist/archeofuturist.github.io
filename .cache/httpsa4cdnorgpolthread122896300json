And in the long run it&#039;s just not fair or feasible for every poor asian and african to come to europe with their friends and family. It&#039;s just not doable. Victims of war are one thing, and supporting them is important. But in Sweden now, the majority of immigrants aren&#039;t victims of war and come here in search of money or work. Which is fair of course, but again- not a solution in the long run.<br><br>I&#039;m looking around a bit but the only real movement against mass immigration and multiculturalism here are SD which are a far right party :\/ And the proper left part in Sweden (v\u00e4nster partiet) are very pro immigration.<br><br>I don&#039;t hate jews, or blacks or gays or any other minority. And I don&#039;t believe in the family values &#039;put women in their&#039; place sort of ideas. <br><br>Is there any sort of movement for left leaning people against immigration?","filename":"images","ext":".png","w":317,"h":159,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493220951092,"time":1493220951,"md5":"FhQInvGh8eUCWvhc5G5fmA==","fsize":1511,"resto":0,"id":"grsSeH4k","country":"SE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"left-leaning-but-against-immigration","country_name":"Sweden","replies":5,"images":1,"unique_ips":5},{"no":122898793,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)11:57:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122896300\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122896300<\/a><br>what you&#039;re saying is you&#039;re a socialist and a nationalist? mh, could there be a moving for that?","time":1493222234,"resto":122896300,"id":"xOdxQDK+","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":122898820,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)11:57:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122896300\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122896300<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I come from a super left leaning family, all of my grandparents but one basically identifying as communists.<\/span><br>KYS","filename":"get the gas","ext":".jpg","w":202,"h":439,"tn_w":57,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493222248721,"time":1493222248,"md5":"Ky8dxQgs1pMA8tyaqnd2zA==","fsize":22113,"resto":122896300,"id":"Bu1SqbU4","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":122899035,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)11:59:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"Nationalist and socialist, huh?<br><br>Hmm...","time":1493222352,"resto":122896300,"id":"z3la+9S6","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":122899052,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)11:59:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122896300\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122896300<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;SD which are a far right party :<\/span><br>According to who?

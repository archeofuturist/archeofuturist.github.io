You act according to what can be universally willed without contradiction because that is the only way to be consistent with the demands of rationality.<br><br>You might think that everyone ought to enjoy classical music and listen to it once a day, but that doesn&#039;t mean that you have to think that other people are acting immorally when they listen to rock music instead.

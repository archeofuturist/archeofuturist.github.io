ALSO WHY NOT FUSION POWER?","com":"Liberals cry so much about the EPA but they are extremely inefficient, overstaffed, and waste untold amounts of money.<br><br>Tax payer funded green energy companies like solyndra (RIP) are just money and power grabs for the elite and their cronies. At the same time, the liberals pass extreme regulations on coal and other fossil fuels which does nothing but stifle competition in the US to give an advantage to these highly inefficient &quot;green&quot; companies.<br><br>Even if the US went 100% carbon free overnight, China and India alone would still be polluting more than enough to keep &quot;climate change&quot; advancing.<br><br>Adjusted for inflation, the U.S. was spending over $1 billion per year on magnetic confinement fusion research by 1977. Now the funding is cut way down, if not eliminated, im not sure of the official numbers.<br> <br>This leads to my question:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Why does the USA not create a Manhattan style project for fusion power? Put billions of dollars in funds towards extremely classified technology that will allow us to have a monopoly on fusion power for the next 50 years? <\/span><br><br>Are we that cucked by Saudi Arabia and bureaucracy?<br><br>Why do liberals cry out for green energy but hardly any of them mention fusion?

He&#039;s getting maybe 40 delegates tops, and that&#039;s being generous, according to what Nate Silver writes on project538.com. After 8 years of Obama, people want someone who&#039;s got a proven record of having consistent conservative values and who hasn&#039;t alienated half of the voter base with his divisive comments and demagogic rhetoric.<br><br>I can&#039;t support Klumpf especially after he&#039;s turned out to be just another neocon Jewish puppet. Trump is fucking finished, he&#039;s not recovering from this. This really was the last straw. All the credible news outlets estimate his approval rates at something like 40% anyway, that&#039;s lower than any other president at this point.<br><br>Do you HONESTLY think that Klumpf can recover after launching the nuclear missile codes at based Assad? I mean, do you even read the \/sg\/ threads? Everyone knows you cannot Mossad the Assad. There even was a Turkish minister who said that he didn&#039;t like Assad in 2011 and he has since then resigned and is no longer the minister. There is clearly a curse associated with people who try to Mossad the Assad.<br><br>Literally all the prominent intellectuals who used to support Klumpf and helped him win the election like Stefan Molyneux and also Jared Taylor have repudiated Klumpf, and no longer want him to have access to the nuclear codes.<br><br>I&#039;m telling you man, Klumpflets are delusional if they think they can keep the nuclear codes. Klumpf will get impeached any second now. It&#039;s just a matter of time.<br><br>Even \/pol\/, which makes up about 95,3% of his supporters, according to Nate Silver has turned on him. He&#039;s not getting the nuclear codes anymore. He&#039;ll have the nuclear codes taken away from him any second now. <br><br>I even heard from sources that there are people on their way to take away the nuclear codes from wummpf as we speak.","time":1491857640,"resto":120489015,"id":"o5\/fhv\/N","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120489345,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)16:54:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"Lets just forget about him.","filename":"234523462346","ext":".png","w":700,"h":700,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491857657329,"time":1491857657,"md5":"debA58qy6XEETrqewZc+RA==","fsize":240469,"resto":120489015,"id":"tHCpe9Cz","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120489493,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)16:55:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120489207\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120489207<\/a><br>Fpbp <br>Sage in all fields","time":1491857716,"resto":120489015,"id":"LHfm+fCA","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120489886,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)16:57:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120489015\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120489015<\/a><br><br>wtf OP I love shareblue.com and communism now!","filename":"image","ext":".jpg","w":400,"h":384,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":120,"tim":1491857879837,"time":1491857879,"md5":"wL1fD0DSJfyHaoRGXkOp1w==","fsize":36519,"resto":120489015,"id":"WvMlIlT5","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

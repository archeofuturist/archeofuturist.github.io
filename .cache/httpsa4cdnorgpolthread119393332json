I&#039;ve never seen it before. I don&#039;t know, probably, somebody discussed it here already. But anyway, I really wanna know guys what&#039;s wrong with your TV? Yeah, TV has always been some source of degradation, but not THAT way. It just horrible how stupid TV can be in one of the most developed countries in the world. <br><br>Colbert is talking to elected president, isn&#039;t he? So Trump is trying to seriously explain what&#039;s going on and this moron keeps making these stupid immature jokes and interrupting him. How is this possible? Man, u are talking to president (or potential president, no matters), do you realize this fact? Where&#039;s the professionalism? Seriosly, what&#039;s going on?<br><br>In Russia we have similar show (Urgant show). There was some episode when Urgant had a conversation with our foreign minister. I don&#039;t even imagine Urgant to be so disrespectful and unprofessional. Yeah, there are some reasons for him to not be it: our state is pretty tough. But I think there are some issues that should be treated more civilisedly.","filename":"48100545.cached","ext":".jpg","w":800,"h":533,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1491259951878,"time":1491259951,"md5":"0+1ghP254qn2XCuBMLEvLQ==","fsize":70685,"resto":0,"id":"qQRuCo3v","country":"RU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"american-tv","country_name":"Russian Federation","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":119393735,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)18:56:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"How&#039;s that metro bombing false flag going, Ivan?","time":1491260167,"resto":119393332,"id":"jg8BQk3I","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

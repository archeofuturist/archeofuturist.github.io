It should be noted he was entirely correct about everything he believed about large-scale social change. This is demonstrable in so far as we are on the cusp of his hoped-for future. <br><br>He designed &quot;cultural Marxism&quot; to undermine the Western culture in anticipation of the new community age. His disciples populated academia and entertainment; and, whereas many other individuals have understood influence, none understood the currency of culture quite like (pic related). It was his vision to cultivate a worker&#039;s subculture which would separate the interests and values of the proletariat from the those of bourgeoisie. This culture would center around a libertine attitude and constant agitation, all toward the end of unsettling the very moorings of &quot;Capitalist&quot; (read, &#039;traditional&#039;) society. The great ship Humanity, thus set on its own way, would soon beg for a Captain wise enough to bring them back into a pacific port. This would be the moment the secret junta appears to welcome us into our amazing new world of centralized control and various scintillating sensations, which are the only thing the de-familied, de-cultured, de-skilled population can think about: how to get new kinds of highs and how to avoid any responsibility.<br><br>His dream has come to pass. Remember. He was correct. He might be the second most important person who lived during the 20th century. Tragically, his vision turns out to be a nightmare and his proselytes tyrants and we are all caught up in it by no choice of our own.<br><br>What should we do, humans? We have been rats in a maze our whole lives, living a failing experiment in transcending humanity whose designers are far too invested to ever give up.

The indifference operates passively, but it operates. It is fate, that which cannot be counted on. It twists programs and ruins the best-conceived plans. It is the raw material that ruins intelligence. That what happens, the evil that weighs upon all, happens because the human mass abdicates to their will; allows laws to be promulgated that only the revolt could nullify, and leaves men that only a mutiny will be able to overthrow to achieve the power. The mass ignores because it is careless and then it seems like it is the product of fate that runs over everything and everyone: the one who consents as well as the one who dissents; the one who knew as well as the one who didn\u2019t know; the active as well as the indifferent.

Remember, Gramsci never thought he would live to see his cultural revolution come to full fruition. He knew that it would take several generations of exposure to subversive cultural programming to finally break the bourgeoisie hegemony. A great way to seed the culture with this subversive cultural programming is by making the programming a part of a gatekeeping proceedure whereby you keep access to certain sorts of jobs and careers behind a payway and then force ideological assent (or more accurately, just generate it out of whole cloth by the telling since the same Gramscians were who turned the public school system completely retarded so everyone coming out would be susceptible to ideological programming in college)<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Pop Culture<\/span><br><br>Music, television, movies...

He is a known Gramscian. In fact, chances are most everybody in your typical college social science department is. But there are casual Gramsci people and there are Gramsci specialists. If there were talented parties interested in treasure hunts, I would put money on the idea that there is a traceable lineage from Gramsci directly to many people in power on the left. You can find this out by tracing citations in doctoral theses and such.

We must catch the backlash before they do. If this board returns to quality, we can use it like it used to be used: it was a weathervane for social trends, and by a proper reading of that weathervane, you could anticipate quite a bit.

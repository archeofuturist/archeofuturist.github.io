The great ship Humanity, thus set on its own way, would soon beg for a Captain wise enough to bring them back into a pacific port. This would be the moment the secret junta appears to welcome us into our amazing new world of centralized control and various scintillating sensations, which are the only thing the de-familied, de-cultured, de-skilled population can think about: how to get new kinds of highs and how to avoid any responsibility.<br><br>His dream has come to pass.

A great way to seed the culture with this subversive cultural programming is by making the programming a part of a gatekeeping proceedure whereby you keep access to certain sorts of jobs and careers behind a payway and then force ideological assent (or more accurately, just generate it out of whole cloth by the telling since the same Gramscians were who turned the public school system completely retarded so everyone coming out would be susceptible to ideological programming in college)<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Pop Culture<\/span><br><br>Music, television, movies...

This is an excellent example of Gramscian strategy at work. Social engineering through regulation (think multigender bathrooms) works well, because Gramsci insists that enacted ideology is ideology no matter whether you understand what you are doing or not. For Gramsci, belief is not import. All that is important is praxis, the movement of bodies through history in space and time. You can regulate people into habits, into conditions of mind, even into opinions. Think about the way that people on social services are naturally incentivized to support the government, even if they have no idea what it is or what it does. This is no accident. The policymakers who create the policies which basically create society know exactly what they are doing, because many of them were educated by people who thought Robert Cox was hot shit in IR circles in the 80s.

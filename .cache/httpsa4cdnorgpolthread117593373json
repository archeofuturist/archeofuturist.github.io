Quantum particles are treated as<br>waveforms due to the randomness of their location and velocity. The<br>void of space is filled with tremendous stars that explode and form<br>bottomless pits of mass. However, Order creates a balance in the<br>Chaos. The universe follows strict laws of physics. Mathematics allow<br>us to predict events.<br> Good and evil do not exist from an objective point of view. Truth<br>comes in the form of Chaos and Order: things that can or cannot be<br>predicted. Other religions tend to focus on the battle between good<br>and evil when in fact NEITHER OF THOSE THINGS EXIST. Good<br>and evil are subjective and don&#039;t even exist in a universe without<br>self-aware beings. Only Chaos and Order.<br> This begs the question: does destiny exist? Does Kek have a plan<br>for all of us? Or does he create and destroy at his whim? Some may<br>think that Kek is controlling everything in our singular universe<br>(Order), but others may believe in a multiverse where any and all<br>possible timelines occur (Chaos).","filename":"a1a","ext":".png","w":600,"h":450,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1490075011173,"time":1490075011,"md5":"FI8gvzeufHrIBOEEdJ+VFQ==","fsize":340036,"resto":117593373,"id":"2lugPJja","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117593549,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)01:44:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Can a society (Kekistan) function on a religion without &quot;right and wrong&quot;?<\/span><br> The answer is YES. Politics has an abundance of Chaos as well as<br>Order. The two go hand in hand! Freedom is inherently Chaotic. The<br>free market is driven by Chaos, as well as the innovative minds of our<br>scholars and artists. By understanding Chaos, we will further<br>understand the struggles of war and disease. ORDER prevents Kekistanis<br>from harming each other, and allows for Balance (Order) in the Chaos.<br>One example of such logic is that Anarcho Capitalism is too much Chaos<br>while Communism is too much Order. The Jew may attempt to bring more<br>Chaos (imbalance) to Kekistan, but we shall maintain Order (stability)<br>to our nation and Kek will unleash his Chaos (wrath) unto the Jew.","time":1490075049,"resto":117593373,"id":"2lugPJja","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117593585,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)01:44:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"Kek rewards those who respect the balance between Order and Chaos.<br><br>Have hope, brothers.

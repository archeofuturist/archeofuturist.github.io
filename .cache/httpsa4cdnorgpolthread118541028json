McVeigh&#039;s house in Golden Valley was increasingly taking on the air of a bunker. In each corner of the house were loaded rifles. In the backyard was what McVeigh described as a bullet berm, a pile of scrap limber fifteen feet long and four feet high, which he&#039;d taken from True Value. The wall of wood would provide a shield if the feds ever started shooting, McVeigh explained.&quot;<\/span><br><br>__________","filename":"mcveigh31","ext":".gif","w":288,"h":200,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":86,"tim":1490650107977,"time":1490650107,"md5":"X1Ow0GuLPUY67bIS7WfmKg==","fsize":35262,"resto":118541028,"id":"70kTjEBj","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118564695,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)17:28:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118563937\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118563937<\/a><br>Yep my city smells like Cherrios, what do you want fellow buff anon","time":1490650118,"resto":118541028,"id":"5m2iXisX","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118564705,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)17:28:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118563937\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118563937<\/a><br>Roch","time":1490650120,"resto":118541028,"id":"tfvHENnj","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118564707,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)17:28:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"https:\/\/en.m.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Inv<wbr>ictus<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Tim&#039;s last words<\/span>","time":1490650121,"resto":118541028,"id":"9u5t9hli","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118564795,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)17:29:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118541028\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118541028<\/a><br>I love these threads","time":1490650161,"resto":118541028,"id":"rc8skSVx","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":118564834,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)17:29:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118564695\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118564695<\/a><br><a href=\"#p118564705\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118564705<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;were everywhere<\/span><br><br>Elmwood village reporting in","time":1490650183,"resto":118541028,"id":"GsN9XfYK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118565044,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)17:31:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118564834\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118564834<\/a><br>Lancaster Village reporting in","time":1490650299,"resto":118541028,"id":"5m2iXisX","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118565065,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)17:31:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118564354\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118564354<\/a><br>lol why&#039;d they have a daycare in a government run gun confiscation and dog killing center?","filename":"1461272843426","ext":".jpg","w":835,"h":776,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":116,"tim":1490650310077,"time":1490650310,"md5":"GGbUsfF\/LrK9pWr8GftENw==","fsize":79867,"resto":118541028,"id":"hDZe98lA","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118565192,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)17:33:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118565065\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118565065<\/a><br>Skip the middleman and just indoctrinate my kids up","time":1490650386,"resto":118541028,"id":"3EVUAWuJ","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":118565211,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)17:33:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118560444\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118560444<\/a><br>based grandfather","time":1490650397,"resto":118541028,"id":"IGuB0izI","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118565474,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)17:35:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"On Tim roaming around seeking order<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;For all the chaos of his life -- his drives down long highways from Michigan to Florida to Arizona and back, his drifting from trailer parks to motels to homes of Army buddies, his job search leading from nowhere to nowhere -- McVeigh exhibited a deep craving for order.In his mind, McVeigh was struggling to order far-flung events and experiences into an all-encompassing &quot;big picture,&quot; as he once called it.&quot;<\/span><br><br>__________<br><br>On Tim&#039;s politeness<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;Jack Gohn, a neighbor in Arizona for part of 1994, said McVeigh was so &quot;quiet, polite and neat and clean&quot; that &quot;if I had a daughter in that age bracket, I would have introduced them.&quot;&quot;<\/span><br><br>__________<br><br>On Tim&#039;s father&#039;s opinion of his son<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;William McVeigh portrayed his son as a bright person who, as a boy, could never quite succeed either in school or at sports.

McVeigh saw himself as a counterpart to Luke Skywalker, the heroic Jedi knight whose successful attack on the Death Star closes the film. As a kid, McVeigh had noticed that the Star Wars movies showed people sitting at consoles - Space-Age clerical workers - inside the Death Star. Those people weren&#039;t storm troopers.

A prisoner was holding a piece of paper to the tiny window of his cell. McVeigh saw that a big letter G was written on the paper. The prisoner removed that piece of paper, and replaced it with another. This one bore the bold letter O. One by one, the prisoner took a letter out of the window and replaced it with another. He was spelling out a message for McVeigh: &quot;G-O-O-D-B-O-M-B&quot;.

Please read carefully and let me know if there are any questions.<br><br>1. Just because foreign media has picked up a story, DOES NOT MEAN THE INFORMATION IS DECLASSIFIED OR NEVER HAD ANY CLASSIFICATION ASSIGNED TO IT. Please use common sense. I see people posting stories from foreign regime run sites (for instance RT), referencing civillian casualties due to NATO activity, NATO troop movements, among other topics. Without verifying from a legitimate source that this information is true and is public domain, you may be in violation of 18 U.S. Code \u00a7 798 - Unauthorized disclosure of classified information by re-posting it. This also applies to Wikileaks, Snowden, and other high profile leaks. If you had a clearance, you would know that there are briefings warning specifically that this information is still classified.<br><br>2. If the information from the foreign-run propaganda website is NOT assigned any classification rendering it illegal to disclose due to being untrue, then reposting it constitutes engaging in informational cyber warfare on behalf of a foreign regime. Posting stories, images, half-truths, hoaxes, and other devices created by foreign regimes to undermine faith in the US Federal Government is not a first amendment issue, you are not speaking your opinion, you are using a public utility to spread propaganda deliberately created as a weapon against the American people. With all the scrutiny currently surrounding Russian meddling in the media and election process, this is not something you want your name linked to. There are so many ways this could be interpreted in the US Code that it is impossible to list them all.","time":1492430332,"resto":121514494,"id":"pLDafF6H","country":"BE","country_name":"Belgium"},{"no":121517502,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)07:59:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121517219\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121517219<\/a><br>(2\/2)<br>In conclusion, if you come across a story on RT (or any other website) alleging some information about US and\/or NATO Military activity overseas and cannot verify it through a legitimate news source, consider that it is either classified information, or false\/fake information created for the purpose of informational cyber warfare.<br><br>Thank you, and again please advise if there are any questions.<br><br>Apologies for the second post, I kept hitting your character limit.","time":1492430371,"resto":121514494,"id":"pLDafF6H","country":"BE","country_name":"Belgium"},{"no":121517560,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)08:00:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121517327\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121517327<\/a><br>Romaniabro is right, they made a social account out of it, so let them suck a cock if they want to.<br><br>In the news:<br>https:\/\/twitter.com\/NovostiDamask\/s<wbr>tatus\/853936378991841281<br>Best Korea shows their support and condemns the traitorous unitedstateians attack!","filename":"whatdidhemeanbythis","ext":".jpg","w":620,"h":387,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":78,"tim":1492430416810,"time":1492430416,"md5":"0X3x8J76Xz5Db8bD5AmALg==","fsize":82833,"resto":121514494,"id":"fTQiVtyR","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":121517570,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)08:00:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121516459\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121516459<\/a>","filename":"nice cartoon","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":436,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":90,"tim":1492430423684,"time":1492430423,"md5":"EO\/BohouRwIYiRV\/FZqHGQ==","fsize":171203,"resto":121514494,"id":"JK9dxJQp","country":"DK","country_name":"Denmark"},{"no":121517582,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)08:00:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121516873\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121516873<\/a><br>Even Bana&#039;s drawing skills are better than this crap.","time":1492430434,"resto":121514494,"id":"K4nNVff5","country":"HR","country_name":"Croatia"},{"no":121517631,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)08:01:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121516391\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121516391<\/a><br>4u","time":1492430467,"resto":121514494,"id":"Ffl8ezOC","country":"HN","country_name":"Honduras"},{"no":121517672,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)08:01:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121517446\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121517446<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121517502\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121517502<\/a><br>Thank you based Belgiumbro!","filename":"grill23","ext":".jpg","w":719,"h":726,"tn_w":123,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492430498033,"time":1492430498,"md5":"RXx5iDIJ8BviMBfiWYbWjA==","fsize":63571,"resto":121514494,"id":"45wL5WWw","country":"RO","country_name":"Romania"},{"no":121517793,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)08:03:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121517327\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121517327<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Minnesota<\/span><br><br>How can one person be based and yet retarded (spergtarded?) at the same time?","filename":"FSA retardation","ext":".gif","w":335,"h":291,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":108,"tim":1492430586385,"time":1492430586,"md5":"gFbs7tGsjH+4pclt2HO4Mg==","fsize":2846488,"resto":121514494,"id":"J5qdPvtR","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":121517829,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)08:03:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121517672\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121517672<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;fake eyebrows<\/span><br>Will they ever learn?","time":1492430609,"resto":121514494,"id":"6xnsrJCw","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":121517886,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)08:04:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121517327\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121517327<\/a><br>&#039;Sota always had a thing for drama<br><br>Its too bad because he contributed a lot","filename":"c578536ac77e847e0c63d6e23c11c5fc","ext":".png","w":525,"h":510,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":121,"tim":1492430654012,"time":1492430654,"md5":"xXhTasd+hH4MY9biPBHF\/A==","fsize":361540,"resto":121514494,"id":"gHZsDOuR","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":121517920,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)08:04:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121517446\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121517446<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121517502\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121517502<\/a><br>Well, that&#039;s retarded.

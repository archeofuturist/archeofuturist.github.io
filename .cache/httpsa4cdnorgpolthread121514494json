Please read carefully and let me know if there are any questions.<br><br>1. Just because foreign media has picked up a story, DOES NOT MEAN THE INFORMATION IS DECLASSIFIED OR NEVER HAD ANY CLASSIFICATION ASSIGNED TO IT. Please use common sense. I see people posting stories from foreign regime run sites (for instance RT), referencing civillian casualties due to NATO activity, NATO troop movements, among other topics. Without verifying from a legitimate source that this information is true and is public domain, you may be in violation of 18 U.S. Code \u00a7 798 - Unauthorized disclosure of classified information by re-posting it. This also applies to Wikileaks, Snowden, and other high profile leaks. If you had a clearance, you would know that there are briefings warning specifically that this information is still classified.<br><br>2. If the information from the foreign-run propaganda website is NOT assigned any classification rendering it illegal to disclose due to being untrue, then reposting it constitutes engaging in informational cyber warfare on behalf of a foreign regime. Posting stories, images, half-truths, hoaxes, and other devices created by foreign regimes to undermine faith in the US Federal Government is not a first amendment issue, you are not speaking your opinion, you are using a public utility to spread propaganda deliberately created as a weapon against the American people. With all the scrutiny currently surrounding Russian meddling in the media and election process, this is not something you want your name linked to. There are so many ways this could be interpreted in the US Code that it is impossible to list them all.","time":1492430332,"resto":121514494,"id":"pLDafF6H","country":"BE","country_name":"Belgium"},{"no":121517502,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)07:59:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121517219\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121517219<\/a><br>(2\/2)<br>In conclusion, if you come across a story on RT (or any other website) alleging some information about US and\/or NATO Military activity overseas and cannot verify it through a legitimate news source, consider that it is either classified information, or false\/fake information created for the purpose of informational cyber warfare.<br><br>Thank you, and again please advise if there are any questions.<br><br>Apologies for the second post, I kept hitting your character limit.","time":1492430371,"resto":121514494,"id":"pLDafF6H","country":"BE","country_name":"Belgium"},{"no":121517560,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)08:00:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121517327\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121517327<\/a><br>Romaniabro is right, they made a social account out of it, so let them suck a cock if they want to.<br><br>In the news:<br>https:\/\/twitter.com\/NovostiDamask\/s<wbr>tatus\/853936378991841281<br>Best Korea shows their support and condemns the traitorous unitedstateians attack!","filename":"whatdidhemeanbythis","ext":".jpg","w":620,"h":387,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":78,"tim":1492430416810,"time":1492430416,"md5":"0X3x8J76Xz5Db8bD5AmALg==","fsize":82833,"resto":121514494,"id":"fTQiVtyR","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":121517570,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)08:00:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121516459\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121516459<\/a>","filename":"nice cartoon","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":436,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":90,"tim":1492430423684,"time":1492430423,"md5":"EO\/BohouRwIYiRV\/FZqHGQ==","fsize":171203,"resto":121514494,"id":"JK9dxJQp","country":"DK","country_name":"Denmark"},{"no":121517582,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)08:00:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121516873\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121516873<\/a><br>Even Bana&#039;s drawing skills are better than this crap.","time":1492430434,"resto":121514494,"id":"K4nNVff5","country":"HR","country_name":"Croatia"},{"no":121517631,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)08:01:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121516391\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121516391<\/a><br>4u","time":1492430467,"resto":121514494,"id":"Ffl8ezOC","country":"HN","country_name":"Honduras"},{"no":121517672,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)08:01:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121517446\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121517446<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121517502\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121517502<\/a><br>Thank you based Belgiumbro!","filename":"grill23","ext":".jpg","w":719,"h":726,"tn_w":123,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492430498033,"time":1492430498,"md5":"RXx5iDIJ8BviMBfiWYbWjA==","fsize":63571,"resto":121514494,"id":"45wL5WWw","country":"RO","country_name":"Romania"},{"no":121517793,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)08:03:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121517327\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121517327<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Minnesota<\/span><br><br>How can one person be based and yet retarded (spergtarded?) at the same time?","filename":"FSA retardation","ext":".gif","w":335,"h":291,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":108,"tim":1492430586385,"time":1492430586,"md5":"gFbs7tGsjH+4pclt2HO4Mg==","fsize":2846488,"resto":121514494,"id":"J5qdPvtR","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":121517829,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)08:03:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121517672\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121517672<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;fake eyebrows<\/span><br>Will they ever learn?","time":1492430609,"resto":121514494,"id":"6xnsrJCw","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":121517886,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)08:04:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121517327\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121517327<\/a><br>&#039;Sota always had a thing for drama<br><br>Its too bad because he contributed a lot","filename":"c578536ac77e847e0c63d6e23c11c5fc","ext":".png","w":525,"h":510,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":121,"tim":1492430654012,"time":1492430654,"md5":"xXhTasd+hH4MY9biPBHF\/A==","fsize":361540,"resto":121514494,"id":"gHZsDOuR","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":121517920,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)08:04:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121517446\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121517446<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121517502\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121517502<\/a><br>Well, that&#039;s retarded.

He was a no-negotiation extremist and rebuffed peace notions in the same manner he refused cooperation and friendship earlier. <br><br>In fact Khomeini proved beyond doubt the he was the one who wanted the war because he&#039;s the only reason it went so long as it did. He refused any peace or negotiation until his military was decisively defeated and he was forced to conditionally surrender and accept peace, which he said was &quot;worse than drinking poison.&quot; The war ended in 1988 on the back of a string of very successful victories by the Iraqi army to ended the Iranian aggression once and for all, but people still believe Saddam to have lost the war not knowing it was a defensive war in the first place against a much more powerful aggressor. Had Saddam not signed the UN treaty giving away the large swaths of land Iraq ended up conquering from Iran this claim wouldn\u2019t be so popular.<br><br>Khomeini gave Iraq more casus belli than almost any country did in the 20th century, and anyone who claims Iraq was the instigator doesn\u2019t know what the fuck they\u2019re talking about.<br><br><a href=\"#p121523405\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121523405<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;jihadiboo<\/span><br>get out","filename":"saddam","ext":".jpg","w":1800,"h":2466,"tn_w":91,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492434456163,"time":1492434456,"md5":"v7GFg98A5\/pGnSWG9PEI8g==","fsize":318880,"resto":121514494,"id":"2WLx8m0z","country":"MA","m_img":1,"country_name":"Morocco"},{"no":121523508,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)09:08:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"You fags gonna blow up any more busses of escaping refugees, or are barrel bombing civilians or gassing on the menu?","time":1492434496,"resto":121514494,"id":"qICfYsBn","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121523708,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)09:10:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121523445\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121523445<\/a><br>fuck Saddam and you","filename":"1461409571823","ext":".gif","w":222,"h":533,"tn_w":52,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492434645861,"time":1492434645,"md5":"xaa498\/sFryj4DykZ+eD+A==","fsize":138451,"resto":121514494,"id":"BgBcFn5z","country":"DK","country_name":"Denmark"},{"no":121523741,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)09:11:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121523508\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121523508<\/a><br>Nah, we not al-Qaeda here.<br>We government.","time":1492434665,"resto":121514494,"id":"fTQiVtyR","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":121523836,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)09:11:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Journalist from @annanewsvk injured by #ISIS drone hit. #DeirEzzor #Syria<\/span><br>https:\/\/twitter.com\/CT_operative\/st<wbr>atus\/853688753633755136<br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Ji0<wbr>-VwTuMkg","filename":"issam+annareporters","ext":".jpg","w":1440,"h":1183,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":102,"tim":1492434719927,"time":1492434719,"md5":"xql9M3ghAtW8hdzklGeBAg==","fsize":370037,"resto":121514494,"id":"Jd\/\/6gdT","country":"AT","m_img":1,"country_name":"Austria"},{"no":121523900,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)09:12:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121523123\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121523123<\/a><br>I&#039;m convinced the autistic cringefests you produce does more harm than good for the things you support tbqh.","filename":"1463795813635","ext":".gif","w":435,"h":244,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":70,"tim":1492434758407,"time":1492434758,"md5":"dvrXlPRRHBCGjw07idU3Rw==","fsize":2769460,"resto":121514494,"id":"FJCFu7WL","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":121523975,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)09:13:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121516272\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121516272<\/a><br>Error: Our system thinks your post is spam.

build, but there were frequent cross-border skirmishes, largely at Iran&#039;s instigation.[15]Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini called on Iraqis to overthrow the Ba&#039;ath government, which was received with considerable anger in Baghdad.[56] On 17 July 1979, despite Khomeini&#039;s call, Saddam gave a speech praising the Iranian Revolution and called for an Iraqi-Iranian friendship based on non-interference in each other&#039;s internal affairs.[56] When Khomeini rejected Saddam&#039;s overture by calling for Islamic revolution[46] in Iraq, Saddam was alarmed.[56] Iran&#039;s new Islamic administration was regarded in Baghdad as an irrational, existential threat to the Ba&#039;ath government, especially because the Ba&#039;ath party, having a secular nature, discriminated and posed a threat to the Shia movement in Iraq, whose clerics were Iran&#039;s allies within Iraq and whom Khomeini saw as oppressed.[56]<\/span>","time":1492436242,"resto":121514494,"id":"2WLx8m0z","country":"MA","country_name":"Morocco"},{"no":121526484,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)09:38:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a

To what extent he can succeed in<br>remaining a symbol for the first phase and at the same time be able to manage the politics of<br>all the other phases, we cannot say he will succeed or fail in this. All these parties agreed<br>unanimously upon overthrowing the Shah and he was brought down. And now the<br>approach of these parties has not been identified yet, but it seems that each party wants something different from what the other parties want in regard to the management of thepolicies. A short while ago, there were statements in this direction. The Shah is finished but there are still signs of a split within the parties. Not between who is with the Shah and who is against him, but among the same big group that worked and agreed upon overthrowing the Shah.","time":1492439162,"resto":121514494,"id":"Ib7NLWsK","country":"JP","country_name":"Japan"},{"no":121531201,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)10:26:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121517327\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121517327<\/a><br>Thank you","filename":"1492204280651","ext":".png","w":400,"h":400,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492439166060,"time":1492439166,"md5":"2tQ8aAFHEOtQAhmuQYOE6Q==","fsize":206636,"resto":121514494,"id":"HG9iCg79","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121531225,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)10:26:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"Pretty cool Mosul videos that RT released covering the whole battle so far<br><br>https:\/\/www.rt.com\/news\/385011-chao<wbr>s-carnage-courage-mosul-vids\/","time":1492439177,"resto":121514494,"id":"Tr28qNHQ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121531299,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)10:27:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121528546\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121528546<\/a><br>It was all in his head.<br>From the moment Xi return to China, Chinese officials keep saying that they do not want any force usage or force demonstration at Korean Peninsula.

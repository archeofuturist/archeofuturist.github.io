The impact is that it will provide more people with assistance but with fewer dollars, especially for the older Americans.<br>Medicaid: The Medicaid expansion is frozen immediately and in two years the states can start to adopt either a block grant for the program or a new formula based on population instead of need. In an attempt to make the bill more conservative, work requirements have been added for most able-bodied recipients who aren&#039;t pregnant or caring for a child under 6.<br>High risk pools: The bill provides $130 billion to states over ten years for high risk insurance pools to cover the most expensive to insure. A new amendment by Rep. Fred Upton of Michigan adds an additional $8 billion to assist people with pre-existing conditions.<br>State waivers: States can obtain waivers so insurers don&#039;t have to offer robust benefits packages that include maternity care and mental health coverage. Waivers can also be obtained to charge sicker people and people with pre-existing conditions more. Those people would most likely then go into the high risk insurance pools.<br>Taxes: It repeals every Obamacare tax including the .9 percent tax on couples making more than $250,000 and a 3.8 percent tax on investment income.<br>Health Savings Accounts: The measure increases the allowable contribution limits of Health Savings Accounts<br>Other: It keeps the Obamacare provision that people under the age of 26 can stay on their parents&#039; insurance.","filename":"DrMarioadv","ext":".png","w":150,"h":287,"tn_w":65,"tn_h":124,"tim":1493923092828,"time":1493923092,"md5":"qmCOj9eUYGJ9ElemKFfSog==","fsize":64172,"resto":124090949,"id":"g4k5\/tAp","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":124091766,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)14:39:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"Chances this passes senate:<br>nil","time":1493923184,"resto":124090949,"id":"Al9RfLAq","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":124092008,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)14:41:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124091766\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124091766<\/a><br>Eh, they only need 51 votes to pass it.

Chicago May Day parade is coming up. Antifa, BLM and other red scum will be in attendance. I might go for the purpose of infiltrating the crowd and document any wrongdoings that we can use for weaponized autism and other ammunition to get these fuckers in trouble. Any Chicago anons feel like going? <br><br>FOR DEFENSE PURPOSES, don&#039;t bring anything other than a 2.5 inch knife and\/or tear gas. Needless to say, don&#039;t bring any gun unless you have an Illinois CCW. Dress like them and act the part but don&#039;t have a big mouth. Bring water and share any weed you have to make them more passive. Also be sure to have medical supplies in you&#039;re backpack. Be careful and exercise extreme caution.","filename":"11102739_1555622431349188_4769754685194034038_n","ext":".jpg","w":200,"h":200,"tn_w":200,"tn_h":200,"tim":1493253406929,"time":1493253406,"md5":"dBAcjQXkGKmzUWlttwH\/GA==","fsize":12455,"resto":0,"id":"BEYNZIV5","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"may-day-chicagogeneral","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

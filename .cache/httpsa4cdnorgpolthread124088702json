If the analytical engine had been built, it would have been the first turing complete machine. Now, Ada Lovelace was smart and educated. She was likely more mathematically proficient than most people on \/pol\/, so the writing of the code was probably not beyond her ability. However, there is no evidence that she ever wrote the code she is supposed to have written. In fact, most evidence seems to suggest she was only offering her input on code\/instruction sets written by someone else. There is also no evidence that the code supposed to have been written by Lovelace was the first. In fact, most scholars consider it unlikely that Babbage didn&#039;t write the first code himself. He was the one who designed the machine after all, and was a far more capable mathematician than Lovelace.","time":1493923409,"resto":124088702,"id":"Xmdc9AjA","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":124092906,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)14:48:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124092287\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124092287<\/a><br>Thanks","time":1493923717,"resto":124088702,"id":"RO\/0cJfI","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124093112,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)14:50:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"Babbage wrote the program and built the machines","time":1493923810,"resto":124088702,"id":"XF+eU5x8","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124093393,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)14:52:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124090883\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124090883<\/a><br>There&#039;s a reason autism correlates with intelligence","time":1493923934,"resto":124088702,"id":"XF+eU5x8","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

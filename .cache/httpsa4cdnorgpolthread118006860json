They were the first to have to deal with immigration and now they are facing the true dangers of rapidly growing immigrant populations, the middle class is somewhat insulated from what goes on below and therefore does not see these issues. They are insulated by living in areas that many immigrants just cant afford to live in.<br><br>The middle class individual may see a immigrant in the school playground and go over and talk to her because she is so intriguing and cultured. Where as in the working class playground at least half of the children are immigrants and there is no mixing , there is more of a stalemate and sides being taken. No one feels comfortable around people of the other groups and communities are destroyed.<br><br>But when these people speak out they are ignored because the people above them do not see their issues , they are insulted from them and they speak down to them as if they are better.<br><br>Hitlers voters were mainly working class. <br>Will their rage save us?<br>Are they are last hope?","filename":"main-qimg-f90b5e8cafa7aee06fb8a99cac2a919e","ext":".png","w":600,"h":401,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":167,"tim":1490313258166,"time":1490313258,"md5":"+QtejK+nruBvuKmcrCqRng==","fsize":329423,"resto":0,"id":"HzkzuzCX","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"will-the-white-working-class-save-us","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":8,"images":3,"unique_ips":7},{"no":118007220,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)19:56:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118006860\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118006860<\/a><br>Forgive the grammatical errors I have been drinking tonight.","time":1490313411,"resto":118006860,"id":"HzkzuzCX","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118007821,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)20:01:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"Love that pic, real men.","filename":"IMG_7114","ext":".png","w":610,"h":341,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":69,"tim":1490313664890,"time":1490313664,"md5":"JCsLPdZTXV4FcT7gmTm+yA==","fsize":191496,"resto":118006860,"id":"pAW\/Pnvx","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118007943,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)20:02:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118006860\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118006860<\/a><br>Roughnecks are so badass.","time":1490313727,"resto":118006860,"id":"J31GKN85","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118008664,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)20:07:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118006860\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118006860<\/a><br>Ironically, if the next microapocalypse happens sooner than later we might still have the demographic leeway to rebuild.","time":1490314029,"resto":118006860,"id":"vMinXMEU","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118008949,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)20:09:30","name":"Shill Finder General","com":"They&#039;re either:<br>- Distracted by club culture, TV, football and other trivial pursuits<br><br>-Convinced that immigration isn&#039;t an issue, and can&#039;t see the transformation from 1950s to now, believing that Muhammadans are few in number (1.2 Billion worldwide) and not an issue.<br><br>- Fuming under the surface but have families, or work is too high priority for them to do anything about it yet<br><br>They&#039;ll be silent and unrepresented unless a vote is given, or a spark ignites and they fear for the safety of their children or friends.<br><br>More matters like the Rotherham child abuse scandal would start a violent chain reaction that could not be stifled.

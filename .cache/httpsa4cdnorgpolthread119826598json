Can anybody tell me? Or is it just pro-Russia shilling? (I like Russia the country and people and would love to have a decent, cautious, diplomatically profitable relationship with Russia. That&#039;s not the point here though.)<br><br>I do find this gas incident highly suspicious, but I don&#039;t see any good guys here. Whether Assad was behind this gassing or not, or whether it even happened or not, plenty of back history paints Assad as a typically brutal, autocratic Arab leader. And ISIS, well, they are obviously a bunch of evil shitheads. Just because Obummer and Shillary helped first organize and arm them doesn&#039;t mean they haven&#039;t blossomed into full monstrousness on their own since then. <br><br>Putin is clearly also a highly unpleasant man, ex-KGB spook that he is and with decades of well-founded rumors about his personal violence and cruel behavior of those around him, not to mention how in true Clinton style, everyone he regards as a threat Mysteriously Dies.<br><br>Again there are no good guys here. I wish we could create safe zones in SA and other Arab countries for all ordinary occupants of Syria and the other troubled areas, get everyone out we can, and then back the fuck off. We don&#039;t need ME oil. We don&#039;t need Shillary&#039;s fucking pet pipeline. I&#039;m sick of war for oil. It destroys those countries, nourishes terrorism worldwide, and damages us and Europe in so many ways.<br><br>Toss McCain onto a land mine, put together those safe zones and help all the ordinary folks we can, and then get the fuck out altogether is what I think we should do.

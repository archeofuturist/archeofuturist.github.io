My grandfather died 6 weeks ago and my grandmother (who has late stage Alzheimer&#039;s) has been living with my parents ever since.<br>It has proven very difficult to take care of her and as a result, they have decided to put her in a nursing home which cost a whopping 2000\u20ac\/month (600\u20ac after financial aid).<br><br>Since my parents are retired (and the fact that my father is an only son and my grandparents never bought a house) and are too proud to ask my brothers and I for money, they&#039;ve decided to sell the house we grew up in and buy something cheaper.<br><br>Now I ask you, why should my parents go down the social ladder when my grandmother has lost almost all of her memories and is behaving like an animal?<br><br>Financial issues aside, is it even ethical to keep her alive? She has forgotten how to chew, how to put clothes on, how to shower, etc... She&#039;s even starting to forget how to speak and just groan or bark when she&#039;s in pain\/discomfort.","filename":"euthanasia","ext":".jpg","w":385,"h":224,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":145,"tim":1493648723147,"time":1493648723,"md5":"6CnKqlTu8SHSIjXSz0WRuw==","fsize":11028,"resto":0,"id":"p9Wa+Eyr","country":"FR","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"why-isnt-euthanasia-more-widespread-my","country_name":"France","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":123626254,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)10:26:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123626134\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123626134<\/a><br>start with urself pierre","time":1493648783,"resto":123626134,"id":"EO0F8RwZ","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"}]}

Only buy fruits and oils from temperate and cold climates (apples, grapes, berries, olive oil (Italian only), vegetable oil (American), etc.) <br><br>Buy pork when possible. Cheaper than beef and just as good, and the culturally whitest meat there is. <br><br>Support our milk industry and buy milk. <br><br>Salmon is a preferred fish because of omega 3s, and the fact that it&#039;s literally always caught by whites. <br><br>Remember to keep these habits in mind when shopping.","filename":"grocery","ext":".jpg","w":2392,"h":1794,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1492122547733,"time":1492122547,"md5":"hRO4eeksyGr6+86bdAxNww==","fsize":864043,"resto":0,"id":"bKod0YCP","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"food-redpill","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

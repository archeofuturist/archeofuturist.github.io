Why is a country that&#039;s $20 trillion in debt, or in any debt at all, responsible for taking in illegal immigrants and refugees? It makes absolutely no sense. Shouldn&#039;t your priority when you&#039;re in that much debt be servicing your debt? The ringmasters of this whole pro-immigrant thing seem to be holders of bonds, since they profit the more that country&#039;s bury themselves in debt, because they can buy more bonds and collect more interest. Most likely the same people who own all the bonds own the media too. And a sure-fire way to accumulate more debt is to import more welfare recipients.","filename":"1469953184778","ext":".jpg","w":1521,"h":1374,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":225,"tim":1491458129344,"time":1491458129,"md5":"ksjUVk+3L3mGPKxmdcqMPA==","fsize":557805,"resto":0,"id":"Jy1kmms7","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"im-pretty-new-here-but-ive-really-been-thinking","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":119712568,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)01:58:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"Because you can sell debt, especially when you&#039;re the House printing the money and holding threat of force over everyone else<br><br>The point isn&#039;t to service debt, it&#039;s to bring in workers to reduce wages while increasing the number of citizens who will work for a slice of the debt, believing it has value","time":1491458321,"resto":119712350,"id":"KVsmKdRM","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

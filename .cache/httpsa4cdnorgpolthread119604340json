When it comes to financial inducators (which are what international investors look at, not unemployment or the amount of sandniggers), we are not doing so bad. If you think investors want to invest in Euros you are deeply wrong. If anything the ECB is doing everythign possible to make investments in Euros less appealing","time":1491406106,"resto":119604340,"id":"8gahR4M1","country":"MC","country_name":"Monaco"},{"no":119616576,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)11:28:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119616128\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119616128<\/a><br>MIDF<br><br>Macaroni internet defense force.<br><br>A bunch of total losers with tiny ties and starcuck latte faggiatos.","time":1491406109,"resto":119604340,"id":"DR8cHvYL","country":"CH","country_name":"Switzerland"},{"no":119616610,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)11:28:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119604340\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119604340<\/a><br><br>fuck off cunt","time":1491406131,"resto":119604340,"id":"wXgiaIff","country":"GR","country_name":"Greece"},{"no":119616650,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)11:29:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119616128\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119616128<\/a><br>Phoneposter here, that explains it.","time":1491406159,"resto":119604340,"id":"cggw1Q1E","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":119616743,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)11:30:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"You&#039;ve got a Chaos Candidate of your own.<br>Now vote for her.","filename":"IMG_0551","ext":".jpg","w":1014,"h":548,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":67,"tim":1491406216923,"time":1491406216,"md5":"q2y8Cq1SRDRHh2RRoBSMeg==","fsize":184239,"resto":119604340,"id":"4MwGntNq","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119617000,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)11:32:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119616101\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119616101<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Who would invest in a currency used by a single, not so powerful anymore country, when you can have a currency used by plenty of other countries.<\/span><br>lolsuk\u044a, I just found several reasons to buy franks, and so can you","filename":"2016-09-07.16.Ten thousand","ext":".jpg","w":800,"h":381,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":59,"tim":1491406378777,"time":1491406378,"md5":"tWuCjCpXyw4KLYW5FhgTKA==","fsize":86311,"resto":119604340,"id":"sdvxJZr9","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":119617467,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)11:37:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119616743\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119616743<\/a><br>but i don&#039;t want chaos, i want France to be France","time":1491406637,"resto":119604340,"id":"FFqoLkZb","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":119617569,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)11:38:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119616574\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119616574<\/a><br>only ECB is investing in euro, that&#039;s ridiculous at this point. Also France needs a currency a little bit weaker than mark to be able to export because we have (had) industries with less productivity and less added value. it&#039;s a positive thing, all countries aren&#039;t equal, they don&#039;t have the same industry, the same techniques and they require different currencies to be competitive. Going back to Franc will be painful in the beginning because we lack a lot of domestic production for everyday use products, so there will be an inflation, franc will go down a bit then when it will be more profitable to product things in France and not elsewhere in the world it will be at equilibrium again. Better than this slow death we are facing with euro were buying power purchase of the low middle class is being annihilated. We can keep euro as a common currency for exchange with other EU countries and as a part of the national reserve.","time":1491406699,"resto":119604340,"id":"pZ6fCp\/Q","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":119617810,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)11:40:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119612081\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119612081<\/a><br>Dig on the French American Foundation and the &quot;young leaders&quot; program. <br>https:\/\/fr.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Frenc<wbr>h-American_Foundation#Programme_.C2<wbr>.AB_Young_Leaders_.C2.BB<br>Washington (ie: the american establishment, not necessarily the White House) picks the most promising young french politicians\/economic leaders, make them benefit from their network to develop &quot;opportunities&quot; in exchange of their loyalty.<br><br>We are not as cucked as the British who are basically a client state that can&#039;t fart without Washington approval but it is pretty close.<br>There are huge suspicion of Merkel being a CIA agent too like numerous members of the CDU and SPD.","filename":"French-American_Foundation_-_France","ext":".png","w":279,"h":66,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":29,"tim":1491406824676,"time":1491406824,"md5":"MVajrCPtDYwJMl8UzTuQkQ==","fsize":5254,"resto":119604340,"id":"H7sijqzL","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":119617935,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)11:41:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119609582\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119609582<\/a><br><a href=\"#p119604496\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119604496<\/a><br>la putain de feuille a raison.","time":1491406892,"resto":119604340,"id":"i6DrN9Vv","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":119618020,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)11:42:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119617467\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119617467<\/a><br><br>Then vote Le Pen, otherwise France will be Algeria.","time":1491406933,"resto":119604340,"id":"h7jS14j4","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119618228,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)11:44:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"Vote Le Pen.

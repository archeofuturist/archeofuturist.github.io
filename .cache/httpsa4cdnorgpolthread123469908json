Like the European Movement or the New European Order. Although as fascism died so did a popular European state. (The EEC wasn&#039;t open about wanting a politically unified Europe so not counting that). Anybody else think that Europe should unified. There&#039;d be lots of benefits from combining the strongest economies. Not really sure which political system would work. Definetely not a federal republic like the USA since look how that shitehole turned out.","filename":"thirgv0","ext":".jpg","w":607,"h":627,"tn_w":242,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493552897473,"time":1493552897,"md5":"7AlZJXP4fZ+ACR6zW4QvAg==","fsize":73793,"resto":0,"id":"BFnRP8j0","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"unified-europe","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":48,"images":6,"unique_ips":17},{"no":123470051,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)07:50:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123469908\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123469908<\/a><br>a unified europe under national socialism would destroy the international satanic bankers and being the world into 10,000 years of peace.","time":1493553020,"resto":123469908,"id":"mlDfRRyI","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123470224,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)07:52:42","name":"Anonymou","com":"<a href=\"#p123470051\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123470051<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;National Socialism<\/span><br><br>Doesn&#039;t work because you need to be in a constant war.","time":1493553162,"resto":123469908,"id":"BFnRP8j0","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123470380,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)07:54:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123470224\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123470224<\/a><br>No you don&#039;t.

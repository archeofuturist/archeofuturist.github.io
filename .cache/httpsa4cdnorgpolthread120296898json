Why? <br>&quot;Because if Earth really wasn&#039;t the center of the universe then why wouldn&#039;t the authorities know about it?&quot; they both claimed. Of course it turned out that Copernicus trusted neither of them instead he did the rational things and trusted HIS OWN experiences over what the mind workers on either side told him was cool and hip. So yes Copernicus was 100% a non-conformist.<br>Now here&#039;s a eye opener for you kids on here: The atheist and the the preacher share the EXACT same reality, only the preacher puts a church on Top while the mental architecture of the atheists mind tells him that he is only chemicals and water, nothing more.<br>Of all people Karl Marx actually pointed out that that church served the same function as state mandated atheism = to organize the spiritual and intellectual for societies purpose. <br><br>So?

Scheler disagrees. He begins with a comparison of Greek love and Christian love. Greek love is described as a movement from lower value to higher value. The weaker love the stronger, the less perfect love the more perfect. The perfect do not love the imperfect because that would diminish their value or corrupt their existence. Greek love is rooted in need and want. This is clearly indicated by the Aristotelian concept of God as the &quot;Unmoved Mover&quot;. The unmoved mover is self-sufficient being completely immersed in its own existence. The highest object of contemplation, and who moves others through the force of attraction because efficient causality would degrade its nature.<\/span><br><br>Part 1\/2","filename":"DEUS PREPARING TO VULT IT UP","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":600,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491760792300,"time":1491760792,"md5":"HdnlfXShzYuedYJuFSDRJg==","fsize":115083,"resto":120296898,"id":"fXe\/K5EY","country":"US","trip":"!!tuOwy1ct2dy","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120311608,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)13:59:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120296898\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120296898<\/a><br>Christians literally worship a jew","filename":"1491118949974","ext":".png","w":327,"h":316,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":120,"tim":1491760799616,"time":1491760799,"md5":"EkMcDMcjwOMWfFlGImLeUw==","fsize":212680,"resto":120296898,"id":"EBv6bcVs","country":"AR","country_name":"Argentina"},{"no":120311658,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)14:00:22","name":"WOLFSHIEM","com":"<a href=\"#p120311592\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120311592<\/a><br><br>Part 2\/2<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In Christian love, there is a reversal in the movement of love. The strong bend to the weak, the healthy help the sick, the noble help the vulgar. This movement is a consequence of the Christian understanding of the nature of God as fullness of being. God&#039;s love is an expression of His superabundance. The motive for love is not charity nor the neediness of the lover, but it is rooted in a deeply felt confidence that through loving I become more personalized and most real to myself. The motive for the world is not need or lack (\u00e0 la Schopenhauer), but a creative urge to express the infinite fullness of being. Poverty and sickness are not values to be celebrated in order to spite those who are rich and healthy, but they simply provide the opportunity for a person to express his love. Rich people are harder to love because they are less in need of your generosity. Fear of death is a sign of a declining, sick, and broken life (Ressent 60). St. Francis&#039; love and care for the lepers would have mortified the Greek mind, but for St. Francis, the threats to well-being are inconsequential because at the core of his being there is the awareness that his existence is firmly rooted in and sustained by the ground of ultimate being. In genuine, Christian love, the lower values that are relative to life are renounced not because they are bad, but simply because they are obstacles to those absolute values which allow a person to enter into a relationship with God. It is through loving like God that we are deified. This is why Scheler sees the Christian saint as a manifestation of strength and nobility and not manifesting ressentiment.<\/span>","filename":"A Communion of Two Good Men","ext":".jpg","w":1600,"h":1509,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":117,"tim":1491760822382,"time":1491760822,"md5":"oeCUjWEoluRarZt3IeDzuQ==","fsize":385354,"resto":120296898,"id":"fXe\/K5EY","country":"US","m_img":1,"trip":"!!tuOwy1ct2dy","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120311659,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)14:00:23","name":"Anonymous","filename":"flags","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":640,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491760823699,"time":1491760823,"md5":"wY4oA\/AF7S94khHXSw50wg==","fsize":34919,"resto":120296898,"id":"rZhDW42U","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120311914,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)14:02:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120301769\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120301769<\/a><br>Different people around the world in the new testament, not only jewish people<br><br>REMEMBER TO SAGE DIVIDE AND CONQUER THREADS.","time":1491760943,"resto":120296898,"id":"GbFnWEuw","country":"CL","country_name":"Chile"},{"no":120311943,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)14:02:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120310783\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120310783<\/a><br>Huge shills for Christianity are those who sit there and say &quot;yes goy christianity is good for you&quot;, ever wondered why alex jones or stefan molyneux shill for christianity?

This is not your fault as us today still struggle to rid ourselves of these politically-motivated lies but you must understand that what you think is the case is just bullshit.","filename":"6e806d5688a8649327f430dc1d7a2f504b639a3fbe5a1bddc882b83ae9a9dfac","ext":".png","w":531,"h":563,"tn_w":117,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491762264921,"time":1491762264,"md5":"3RZdWFC7YoM9f0SHnwZclg==","fsize":48019,"resto":120296898,"id":"fXe\/K5EY","country":"US","trip":"!!tuOwy1ct2dy","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120314866,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)14:26:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120296898\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120296898<\/a><br>Atheist here, didn&#039;t Jews try to kill Jesus so Christians hate (((them)))?

In fact, Jews have spent the last 300 years trying to get white people to denounce Christianity. Christianity was forced upon white people to turn them away from their natural individualism and accept a more unified collective. This hurt Jews because it created an &quot;us vs. them&quot; atmosphere that kept them at the bottom of the social hierarchy in predominantly Christian societies. It&#039;s true that Christianity is Semitic in nature, but it was constantly molded by European people to allow them to continue many of their traditions while still semi-unifying everyone under the term &quot;Christian.&quot; Many movements heavily supported by Jews throughout the last few centuries, especially the last one, were self-admittedly anti-Christian. The breaking point was finally reached in the mid 60s with the counter-culture movement opening white people&#039;s eyes to their true nature of individualism.<br><br>The problem with individualism is that it is accepting of people who share different views than them and is thus weak to collectives (weak and accepting, isn&#039;t that funny). In a group of 1 million individuals out for their own self-interests and refusing to acknowledge group identities, a unified collective of even a mere 1,000 can easily dominate and manipulate the rest due to their teamwork and the majority&#039;s lack of group interests.<br><br>I&#039;m an atheist, by the way, but this is the truth.

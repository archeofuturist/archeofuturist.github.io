Hybrid vigor (heterosis) can occur, but only in the F1 generation. Subsequent generations will be effected with hybrid breakdown from outbreeding depression. <br><br>In the following link, you&#039;ll read that when two populations of boodies were reintroduced, scientists were concerned about outbreeding depression:<br>https:\/\/m.phys.org\/news\/2015-03-iso<wbr>lated-boodies-repopulate-mainland.h<wbr>tml<br><br>In the next link, you&#039;ll read that two subspecies of lions were interbred and it created retarded offspring:<br>http:\/\/newsvote.bbc.co.uk\/mpapps\/pa<wbr>getools\/print\/news.bbc.co.uk\/2\/hi\/s<wbr>outh_asia\/4101049.stm<br><br>More links:<br>http:\/\/pastebin.com\/4qDqptnR<br>https:\/\/majorityrights.com\/weblog\/c<wbr>omments\/the_health_consequences_of_<wbr>race_mixing\/<br>https:\/\/majorityrights.com\/weblog\/c<wbr>omments\/alon_ziv_on_race_mixing\/","filename":"IMG_0691","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":1024,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490712105626,"time":1490712105,"md5":"c9ZHLPPmG1c2ILNWAjjPag==","fsize":248086,"resto":0,"id":"9ch3C2re","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"race-mixing","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

The DR remains the most rapid economy in the region in 2014 and 2015, with a real GDP growth at 7 percent. Recent growth has been driven by construction, manufacturing and tourism. On the demand side, private consumption has recently been strong, as a result of low inflation (under 1% on average in 2015), job creation, as well as high level of remittances. <\/span><br>http:\/\/www.worldbank.org\/en\/country<wbr>\/dominicanrepublic\/overview","time":1491751798,"resto":120287545,"id":"nrwnMAGz","country":"DO","country_name":"Dominican Republic"}]}

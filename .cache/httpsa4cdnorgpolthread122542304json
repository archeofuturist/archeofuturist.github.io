You look at TPP, one of the first executive orders the President signed was getting out of TPP. You look at ethics, that was one of the bullet points. You had every employee of the West Wing signed an ethics pledge that said youre not going to lobby for five years after you leave this place, and youre never going to lobby for a foreign country. Look at Neil Gorsuch, first 100 days a Supreme Court justice is sworn in, first time since 1881. And if you just give me one minute, I wont drone on. But, this idea about major legislation not being passed within the first 100 days, Barack Obama had a prebaked stimulus package that started in October passed in February, it was pre-baked. George Bush didnt get any major legislation until June. Clinton, August 10th. Bush 41, a year and a half later. Reagan, August 13th. Carter, 658 days after he took the office. Nixon, one year. Johnson, 225 days. Here is the deal, the President signed over 28 bills already. Health care may happen next week; it may not. Were hopeful it will. As far as border security, you said the military. We have right now in the CR negotiating one of the biggest increases in military spending in decades. So, he is fulfilling his promises and doing it at breakneck speed.<br><br>(1\/3)","filename":"1483153995121","ext":".jpg","w":650,"h":650,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493011880493,"time":1493011880,"md5":"3Ukzcp7Fym43Zeb9asCUFg==","fsize":44606,"resto":122542304,"id":"FlZaLnKg","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122548361,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)01:31:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122547368\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122547368<\/a><br>Exposed the opportunists and shills","filename":"1463483546572","ext":".png","w":1024,"h":1178,"tn_w":108,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493011880965,"time":1493011880,"md5":"cmrTtWNhfAYr7bvgrjKuSw==","fsize":907565,"resto":122542304,"id":"VVSDhpmi","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":122548369,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)01:31:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122548156\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122548156<\/a><br>do you think he was still alive when they took that picture?","time":1493011885,"resto":122542304,"id":"dmDQSmCQ","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122548383,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)01:31:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122542515\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122542515<\/a><br><a href=\"#p122542519\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122542519<\/a><br><a href=\"#p122542577\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122542577<\/a><br><a href=\"#p122542682\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122542682<\/a><br><a href=\"#p122543569\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122543569<\/a><br><a href=\"#p122543912\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122543912<\/a><br><a href=\"#p122544187\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122544187<\/a><br><br>I hate you <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I hate you<\/span><br>I hate you <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I hate you<\/span><br>I hate you <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I hate you<\/span><br>I hate you <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I hate you<\/span><br>I hate you <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I hate you<\/span>","time":1493011891,"resto":122542304,"id":"gIoqE9wc","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122548406,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)01:31:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"That Bill Nye video is so embarrassing","filename":"5a19ccd541c1b923a746723363fc9333","ext":".jpg","w":2880,"h":4376,"tn_w":82,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493011903095,"time":1493011903,"md5":"ySjdBo61Aq53vr5gYjfovw==","fsize":594901,"resto":122542304,"id":"okNUoGrG","country":"AU","m_img":1,"country_name":"Australia"},{"no":122548412,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)01:31:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122545490\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122545490<\/a><br>Does anyone have the 2nd page to this?

We need to end that and then we have to wrestle what to do about people who have been here a long time. But, I would say that the President is honoring his commitments to the American people, to fix this border and were going to stay at it.

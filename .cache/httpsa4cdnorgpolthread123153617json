I chased him down in my truck until he crashed in some gravel, then got out and grabbed his back wheel as he tried to get away and crushed his nuts on his bike. Then I shoulder checked him off his bike again into a bush and called the cops while pushing him around to keep him from escaping and whipped the shit out of him with the belt when he hit me.

Parents project their own flaws and insecurities on a child and it blows up and comes out in a fit of rage when they cannot seem to control the child. They do not have the proper mentality or lingual ability to verbally hammer some sense into the child. Instead they just slap it and hit it around like clay hoping it to take shape instantly or later on in life. Contrary to boomer belief the only affect of beating a child is to momentarily scar them for life just to get them to &quot;stop doing something&quot;. They don&#039;t understand why or how and they go back to doing it again after they&#039;ve been hit. They do it when you&#039;re not looking, they do it behind your back, whatever it may be that you wish to instill in them through a beating, it is only momentarily stopped due to the simple logic of &quot;oh fuck parents gonna fucking hit me, I&#039;ll just not do it when they&#039;re around because it pisses them off for some reason.&quot; Some may try to remedy it by apologizing for hitting them and explaining why, and while the parent may assume the child is capable of understanding the reason behind a beating out of anger\/wanting them to learn something and then getting an explanation, the child cannot extrapolate so many narratives due to their lack of cognitive development and instead bottle up a jumble of thoughts that equal=getting hit for stuff parents don&#039;t like, this piece of shit hit me for such a dumb reason, or the worst one &quot;I&#039;ll remember this and I will get you back&quot;. Hitting a child stays with them and earns you resentment and a cold shoulder as they get older. Yes there are retards who want to play the best friend card and try to be the friend of the child and never even raise their voice, but these people fail equally as miserably as those who hit their children.

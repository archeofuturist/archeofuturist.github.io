You see this in 40k as chaos brings even worse totalitarian matters.<br><br>If you read the horus heresy, you learn the emperor banned religion bcos faith feeds the chaos gods. The illuminati outlaw all faith that is not gnostic or based in reason. The religion of reason was a brief thing done in the french rev, minerva owl statues, changing the calendar to rational 10 days and removing religious holidays. Freemasons put a statue of giordano bruno actoss from the vatican, an occultist and scientist burned. <br><br>The freemasons love reason, as christiajity is faith based, they think reason, science, and occult secrets will make them gods, gnosticism. In the gnosric view lucifer is the hero for raising humanity above the cruel gods.<br><br>In the horus heresy the Emperor makes a pact with the chaos gods for a lot of their power, but he betrays them, it was a ruse to get more power to kill them. Horus is true to the evil gods who demand slavish obedience. The Emperor turned on the real gods to become a god to free humanity.<br><br>A certain Satanic website out there says satanism had its origins in the far east, in yoga and tibet raising spirit energies.

In the third world yeah it can be the poor and destitute who turn to insurgencies but more for making a buck. It&#039;s almost always the middle or upper class who turn to Jihadism. The one exception is the prison-jihad complex where poorer and more destitute people (like Zarqawi) go to prison and have their violent tendencies augmented by jihadist intellectuals who are almost always the more middle\/upper class. Osama was upper class, Baghdadi was middle class (If not for the Iraq war and the prison Jihad complex he would have ended up some no name Mullah. He was a religious nerd), most of the Bataclan terrorists have been middle class. Boston Bombers were lower middle class.

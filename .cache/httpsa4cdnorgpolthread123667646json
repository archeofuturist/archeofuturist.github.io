Leftpol sees the SJWs and the Alt Right as dividers of the working class and is an enemy.<br><br>A good read here: https:\/\/ratical.org\/ratville\/CAH\/Fo<wbr>rdFandCIA.html<br><br>All of leftists in lefty pol basically have the same goal. No government, and no money. Though all have different ways of achieving it.<br><br>The Tankies and the MLs (Marxist-Leninists) are your stereotypical view of communism. But they aren&#039;t supported virtually. <br><br>You have Ancoms, and other anarchists who view the USSR as state capitalism. This meaning that the state has a political class oppressing the working class. And see only a world revolt can work. <br><br>Then there are Left Communists who are like the reactionaries of the right. Who see that the capitalist culture is too embedded in our society to be overthrown in our current state, and we have to wait for when the world is ready. <br><br>You have the moderate radicals (Like me), who want neither direct anarchy, nor the state being another oppressor. De Leonists Strasserites and guild socialists are under this umbrella. <br><br>The last group is a baby made from Hitler and Stalin called National Bolshevism. <br><br><br>In the end, I don&#039;t see them as a threat considering that they have no power in the west at all. At most, it is the liberals that hold the power.

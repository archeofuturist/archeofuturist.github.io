This meaning that the state has a political class oppressing the working class.

Who see that the capitalist culture is too embedded in our society to be overthrown in our current state, and we have to wait for when the world is ready. <br><br>You have the moderate radicals (Like me), who want neither direct anarchy, nor the state being another oppressor.

That&#039;s the big reason why Marxism as written can&#039;t work - it falls apart if greed or laziness exist, and instantly disintegrates if both exist at the same time, unless the coefficient of selfless Heroes of the Union is just gigantic.

The camps had recreation programs and everything. The only gas they used was to try and keep typhus away but in many cases the typhus won. Mass deaths didn&#039;t occur until the bombing of all the supply lines all the refugees starved because of the allies. They kept records of everyone that died in the camp and it comes out to less than 300K. Hitler didn&#039;t even believe in exterminating everyone he believed in the preservation and protection of everyone and that much like how there are stronger dogs breeds there are stronger human breeds and simply putting different animals in society together isn&#039;t good for the genes.

In order to confirm his right to rule, rather than any of his brothers, he prayed Poseidon send him a snow white bull as a sign. Poseidon sent Minos the bull, with the understanding that it would be sacrificed to the god. Deciding that Poseidon&#039;s bull was too fine a specimen to kill, Minos sent it to his herds and substituted another, inferior bull for sacrifice. Enraged, Poseidon had Aphrodite cause Pasipha\u00eb, wife of Minos, to fall in love with the bull. She subsequently gave birth to the half-man, half-bull, Minotaur. Poseidon passed on his rage to the bull, causing it lay waste the land.&quot;<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;tfw you realize that the Minotaur was the Ancient Greek version of &quot;my wife&#039;s son&quot;<\/span>","filename":"Minotaur","ext":".jpg","w":624,"h":829,"tn_w":188,"tn_h":249,"tim":1493227717572,"time":1493227717,"md5":"jXijs8uvypvkyAIIUjwldA==","fsize":129308,"resto":0,"id":"PkisLiJF","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"minos-was-king-in-crete-in-order-to-confirm-his","country_name":"United States","replies":3,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":122910175,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)13:32:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122909724\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122909724<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;child who grows up without knowing his father becomes a violent fuckhead<\/span><br>Really gets those gears moving","time":1493227945,"resto":122909724,"id":"WfrCjfOa","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122910852,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)13:37:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122910175\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122910175<\/a><br>ikr<br>Do you think its us reading our own understanding into the myth, or did they Greeks already understand that thousands of years ago?","time":1493228273,"resto":122909724,"id":"PkisLiJF","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122912386,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)13:48:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122910852\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122910852<\/a><br>It&#039;s probably no accident.<br>Myths can be parables both literal and metaphorical.

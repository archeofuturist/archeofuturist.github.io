Well no French fries for me I guess , I can&#039;t even eat at a fucking Bueno Taco! Can&#039;t live my life anymore , so I&#039;m here to say I quit. I wanted to relinquish to yourselves my flag and my art , but before l do here is a story and my heart .<br><br>I saw an automobile in Lapland once when I was younger in acting , Now they&#039;re everywhere. The world went and got itself in a big damn hurry. I say to myself lots that I wouldn&#039;t give in but I here, take a piece of my soul .<br><br>You might not know this cause of the gag order but I am being sued by all the people I assaulted, all the &quot;nazis&quot; and I am sorry , doesn&#039;t change how I acted or the amount of money it&#039;s costing me.<br>The parole board got me into this halfway house and a job bagging groceries at the Foodway. It&#039;s hard work. I try to keep up, but my hands hurt most of the time. I don&#039;t think the store manager likes me very much. Since my last movie bombed I&#039;m just trying my best.<br><br>Sometimes after work I go to the park and feed the birds. I keep thinking Jaiden might show up and say hello, but he never does. I hope wherever he is, he&#039;s doing okay and making new friends. <br><br>I have trouble sleeping at night. I wake up scared. Sometimes it takes me a while to remember where I am. <br><br><br>Maybe I should get me a gun and rob the Foodway, so they&#039;d send me home. I could shoot the manager while I was at it, sort of like a bonus. But I guess I&#039;m too old for that sort of nonsense anymore. I don&#039;t like it here. I&#039;m tired of being afraid all the time. I&#039;ve decided not to stay. <br><br><br>I doubt they&#039;ll kick up any fuss. <br><br>You have defeated my guys , I will fade into obscurity <br>Not for an old crook like me.","filename":"IMG_1085","ext":".jpg","w":620,"h":412,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":166,"tim":1493172089942,"time":1493172089,"md5":"GedFxCyfZSzh00NTirTm\/g==","fsize":195038,"resto":0,"id":"GhFIrjxp","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"sick-of-being-raided-by-pol","country_name":"United States","replies":11,"images":0,"unique_ips":10},{"no":122825671,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)22:02:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122825558\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122825558<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;american flag<\/span><br>aren&#039;t you supposed to be in like finland or some shit?","time":1493172142,"resto":122825558,"id":"rik1LjYO","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122825682,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)22:02:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"post proof its you otherwise fuck off","time":1493172146,"resto":122825558,"id":"YBxelXL7","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122825839,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)22:03:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122825558\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122825558<\/a><br>lmao why do you care about that nigger jayden","time":1493172216,"resto":122825558,"id":"JFfPsLH\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122825966,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)22:04:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122825671\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122825671<\/a><br>Truthfully , my dude , I&#039;m being sued to high hell and I&#039;m in New York with my lawyer here , that nazi I shoved at the art museum is suing me .","time":1493172277,"resto":122825558,"id":"GhFIrjxp","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122826338,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)22:07:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122825966\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122825966<\/a><br><br>Spaces between puntuation confirms this is the real deal.","time":1493172443,"resto":122825558,"id":"hP1fSMTN","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122826349,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)22:07:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122825966\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122825966<\/a><br>Hopefully you&#039;re in the blast zone during the Nuke tomorrow. <br><br>Rest easy fool.","time":1493172451,"resto":122825558,"id":"23+XYVz1","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122826589,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)22:09:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122826349\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122826349<\/a><br>After these last 3 months MEEEE TOOOO","time":1493172566,"resto":122825558,"id":"GhFIrjxp","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122826654,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)22:09:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"T.

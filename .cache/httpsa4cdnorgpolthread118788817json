The red pill is antisocial, hateful, and overall just a horrible experience. How can I stop hating immigrants, believe the vast majority of Muslims are moderate, and believe that non-whites are just as capable and good as whites? Becoming so radical is seriously antisocial and makes it difficult to get through life.","filename":"feelsbadman","ext":".png","w":645,"h":773,"tn_w":208,"tn_h":249,"tim":1490796343867,"time":1490796343,"md5":"tblPQqPbBdg5LPt+s+ZGAw==","fsize":47678,"resto":0,"id":"KWbeusuN","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"bpg","country_name":"United States","replies":12,"images":5,"unique_ips":10},{"no":118790433,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)10:23:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118788817\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118788817<\/a><br>You&#039;re here forever","filename":"1490638013586","ext":".jpg","w":890,"h":876,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":123,"tim":1490797437847,"time":1490797437,"md5":"6xwIHcC2WIrfQ2Gu2RiaNg==","fsize":109429,"resto":118788817,"id":"Uzpx9879","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118790920,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)10:29:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"OP, you just have to shift your focus. Stop seeing people as groups and look at people as individuals. Statistics can inform us about group behavior, but it doesnt hold true for individuals.

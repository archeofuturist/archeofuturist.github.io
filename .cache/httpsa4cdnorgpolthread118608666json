Cops had cornered this dude with a shotgun and then simply gave him a rugby tackle when he was trying to reload it. The dude pulled it up and tried to fire at the cops face, remembered he was empty, then tried to swing it at him but got taken down. I don&#039;t know whether to call that tough or lenient, but they leave their guns in the car most of the time","time":1490675140,"resto":118608666,"id":"2iXpl\/2U","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"}]}

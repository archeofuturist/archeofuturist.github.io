So far, I am only about 20 pages in, but I am already deeply annoyed at the author. I am certain, having never read the book, the argument he is getting to is that geographical factors are the source for the different levels of technological advancement and achievement throughout the centuries between Asians, white Europeans, Africans, and everyone else. The first pages of the book start off with him refuting the idea that there is any reason to suppose that whites are inherently smarter than anyone else (I agree with this view, I don\u2019t think that there is a genetic advantage for the white race over any other). He dismisses the idea of white genetic superiority with an understandable level of condescension.<br><br>HOWEVER, immediately after this, he makes the argument that New Guineans (where he spent many years for his research) are on average smarter than white Europeans. He then goes on to make arguments for their intellectual superiority mirroring arguments that would make the staunchest racists proud. He argues that the need for intelligence is greater in the jungle than in the city. That the intelligent have an easier time surviving there, and go on to have children and pass on their genes. Whereas in the city people are rarely murdered, and mainly killed by disease which attacks both the intelligent and unintelligent equally. <br><br>This is the exact same argument he, only a few pages earlier, dismissed as ludicrous when made about white Europeans or Asians. But, somehow, this is perfectly logical when made about black people in New Guinea. <br><br>So, what do you all think? Are there any genetic factors to intelligence? And why do professor DESPISE the mere suggestion that whites possess superior intelligence but bend over backwards to make the claim about blacks?","filename":"1842","ext":".jpg","w":311,"h":475,"tn_w":163,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491549057797,"time":1491549057,"md5":"S3kKTDjPkVxK+mk+F8tBdw==","fsize":28080,"resto":0,"id":"rq7u1bUu","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"hypocritically-applied-logic","country_name":"United States","replies":3,"images":0,"unique_ips":4},{"no":119905228,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)03:12:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"Tl;dr Jared is a filthy kike whose work is widely disregarded, even by other kikes","time":1491549165,"resto":119905026,"id":"iSJQJ51\/","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":119905370,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)03:13:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"He&#039;s an idiot.

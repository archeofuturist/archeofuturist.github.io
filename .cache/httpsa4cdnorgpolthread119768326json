Putin still thinks we&#039;re on the same side.&quot;<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;Syria? Yes sir. Things are going to plan so far. World War III will be right along schedule as you&#039;ve planned it.&quot;<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;The CIA will soon make sure that Ron and Rand are no longer a thorn in your side, sir.&quot;<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;My cover is intact, sir. Nobody knows who I really am. Yes, David Bowie knew my identity, but he and the &#039;proof&#039; he had have both been disposed of.&quot;<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;Oh don&#039;t worry about that, sir. I have a tough skin and it is an honor to lose face for the sake of what you&#039;ve been working towards.&quot;<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;Well sir, when I&#039;m finished people will be begging for open borders.&quot;<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;I wouldn&#039;t worry about \/pol\/, sir. They are useful idiots that have played out their part and I.. ah.. I suspect that soon 4chan and other internet boards with an anonymous posting option on them will soon no longer afford to keep up with the soon to be rising cost of internet bills.&quot;<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;Heh. Tell the future Madam President I said hello.&quot;<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;What should I do about Stein?&quot;<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;Yes, sir. I&#039;ll keep her under surveillance.&quot;<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;Yes. Thank you. Goodbye....

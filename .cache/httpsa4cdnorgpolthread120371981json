This does not mean they will remain fundamental methods of transportation. The issue is what will happen if roads become privatized? Well we have private contractors to build and maintain them, so that issue is solved. So the question arises as to who controls them? Well if they are controlled privately and that party begins to act as a cartel then this will push people to look for alternate methods of transportation. Yes they may even take up walking or riding a horse again at first. At the same time, they will also begin to innovate for other means of transportation as well. This is the beauty of the free market. However, you seem to think that if roads are controlled then all transportation simply ends and the story is over. When people face a monopoly upon their choices they will begin to look for substitutions. What these substitutions are we cannot determine unless we visit \/x\/ so that we may learn the ability to peer into an alternate future.","time":1491790905,"resto":120371981,"id":"zJH2w4C+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120377627,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)22:25:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120373219\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120373219<\/a><br>That would actually be a great way to get niggers off the streets.","time":1491791120,"resto":120371981,"id":"KS4aiiGs","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120377942,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)22:27:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120373203\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120373203<\/a><br>Oh fuck off.

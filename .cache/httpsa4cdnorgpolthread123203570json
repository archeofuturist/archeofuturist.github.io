Until then I can only observe that tons of cultures have similarities and differences on what is morally right or morally wrong. The only thing that actually matters is the morality of the society in which you live because you&#039;ve agreed as a citizen to live by its laws. <br><br>Its not morally wrong to break the laws if you think you&#039;re right as long as you accept the consequences for such actions. People that live as a citizen, break the laws, and then still expect to be treated as a free citizen are shitlords that don&#039;t actually have any sense of justice.","time":1493401908,"resto":123203570,"id":"+4LNEnZ2","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123221866,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)13:53:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123221637\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123221637<\/a>","filename":"1493149354620","ext":".jpg","w":800,"h":540,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":84,"tim":1493402031884,"time":1493402031,"md5":"JfC0TlsR+OuZsI2DLA20UA==","fsize":114765,"resto":123203570,"id":"hcUDLOO5","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123222014,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)13:55:15","name":"Anonymous","filename":"1487821034772","ext":".jpg","w":543,"h":474,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":109,"tim":1493402115307,"time":1493402115,"md5":"srleeIa+o5KGoyBrHBXtNQ==","fsize":31929,"resto":123203570,"id":"NBvCbqJl","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123222105,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)13:56:04","name":"Anonymous","filename":"1487818651247","ext":".jpg","w":501,"h":400,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":99,"tim":1493402164547,"time":1493402164,"md5":"hlQ19jTPLTCW2VPYthJ1FA==","fsize":64266,"resto":123203570,"id":"NBvCbqJl","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123222125,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)13:56:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123221866\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123221866<\/a><br>There&#039;s a big difference between &quot;morality is objective so you shouldn&#039;t judge&quot; and &quot;Morality is objective but I think my morality is right and I&#039;m going to prove them wrong because people that fuck children are subhuman degenerates&quot;.","time":1493402179,"resto":123203570,"id":"+4LNEnZ2","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123222237,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)13:57:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123216080\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123216080<\/a><br>What site is that?<br><br><a href=\"#p123219175\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123219175<\/a><br>And this? <br><br>I need more tests to take","time":1493402240,"resto":123203570,"id":"1bW8TXMF","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123222423,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)13:59:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123219175\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123219175<\/a><br><br>link?","time":1493402343,"resto":123203570,"id":"G1EuM3Bt","country":"IT","country_name":"Italy"},{"no":123222438,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)13:59:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123222125\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123222125<\/a><br>This makes no sense nigger jew.<br><br> Objective morality is judgement of behavior.

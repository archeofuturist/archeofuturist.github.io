Depends on your definition of nigger though. I don&#039;t consider talented blacks niggers. Keith Richards idolized a lot of black musicians like Muddy Waters, Chuck Berry etc. And they were definitely not niggers. Our great white rock bands simply wouldn&#039;t exist without those guys. Rolling stones, Beatles, Zeppelin. All of them had black musician role models. <br><br>Have a look at the progression of technology with regards to the quality of music. Fairly sure Jim Morrison said back in the 60&#039;s electronic music would overtake traditional music and hes spot on. I grew up with Daft Punk as a teenager and still like that shit because of nostalgia. But i also grew up with Zeppelin and Sabbath LP&#039;s played on a crappy 80&#039;s HiFi. Anyone with a computer can make so called music now days, every riff imaginable has been done to death, and been copied a million times. The days of growing up with nothing except a radio and a guitar are gone, so innovation has gone out the window with it. The majority of today&#039;s 18yo&#039;s have never seen a band play live that has four guys on their instruments. Bass guitar drums vocals. There is still great music being made today by young people but it isn&#039;t pushed by multi billionaire corporations. They get to see the musical genius of Skrillex. <br><br>Turn off your computer, go see a local band live. And pick up a guitar. Been playing for 15 years, nothing comes close to the joy of being able to nail a solo you like after a lot of practice.","time":1492692868,"resto":121989495,"id":"oWY0HRAP","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"}]}

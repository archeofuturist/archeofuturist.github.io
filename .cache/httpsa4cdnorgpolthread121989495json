Keith Richards idolized a lot of black musicians like Muddy Waters, Chuck Berry etc. And they were definitely not niggers. Our great white rock bands simply wouldn&#039;t exist without those guys. Rolling stones, Beatles, Zeppelin. All of them had black musician role models. <br><br>Have a look at the progression of technology with regards to the quality of music. Fairly sure Jim Morrison said back in the 60&#039;s electronic music would overtake traditional music and hes spot on. I grew up with Daft Punk as a teenager and still like that shit because of nostalgia. But i also grew up with Zeppelin and Sabbath LP&#039;s played on a crappy 80&#039;s HiFi. Anyone with a computer can make so called music now days, every riff imaginable has been done to death, and been copied a million times. The days of growing up with nothing except a radio and a guitar are gone, so innovation has gone out the window with it. The majority of today&#039;s 18yo&#039;s have never seen a band play live that has four guys on their instruments. Bass guitar drums vocals. There is still great music being made today by young people but it isn&#039;t pushed by multi billionaire corporations. They get to see the musical genius of Skrillex. <br><br>Turn off your computer, go see a local band live. And pick up a guitar.

What Led Zeppelin, The Beatles, Skrillex, Diplo and The Rolling Stones all have in common is that their music disappears when all the people who were around for it die. The songs just make less sense when they aren&#039;t framed by douchey antics.<br><br>You can hate jazz for being nigger music or whatever all you want, but &quot;classical&quot; or &quot;art&quot; music hasn&#039;t produced a master orchestrator to the level of George Russell, Gil Evans or Maria Schneider or even Thad Jones probably since Stravinsky (who was vehemently against Bolshevism and supported the Royal Family).

Most musicians can write good tunes, but it takes a producer to polish the tunes and make it really sound good. Only a select few musicians are good at both. The indie scene has contributed to the death of music greatly because actual musicians were lied to, thinking that they would be able to produce anything they want and have it sound great. And also, with the music industry being so indoctrinated by the left (as with all other good things in life), the musicians thought that they were fighting the &quot;big mean corporate machine&quot; but publishing on their own garage labels. <br><br>But again, most musicians simply dont have that producer&#039;s touch.

I&#039;m sure there are still white musicians out there making great music, but they don&#039;t get promoted. But we simply don&#039;t hear them, and I&#039;m not so seriously into music that I&#039;m going to bother spending time trying to find them. I usually just turn on the rock FM radio station while driving to work, and call it a day. But nothing new has really come about in rock music, and it&#039;s the same songs I&#039;ve been listening to since my childhood. The same music from the 60s-90s that my father listened to as well. The white man&#039;s music has grown stale, and I&#039;m sure there&#039;s good stuff out there, but we don&#039;t hear it. And when I say &quot;there must be good music out there that&#039;s just unknown and unpromoted&quot; I&#039;m not talking about that hipster nu-male Neutral Milk Hotel indie shit, either. <br><br>A related problem is that music has essentially been focus tested and distilled and distilled further and further until it&#039;s just become a scientific formula that&#039;s specifically designed to catch on with as many people as possible. It&#039;s what&#039;s given rise to modern pop music, which all sounds the same. And there aren&#039;t even really any distinct genres anymore, because they&#039;ve all just been distilled into one amorphous blob of nothingness. There used to be rock music. Now it&#039;s been converted into pop. There used to be country music. Now it&#039;s been converted into pop. There used to be rap and other black music. That&#039;s just been converted into pop as well (say what you will about nigger music, at least it used to be its own damn thing). It&#039;s all just the exact same shit now. There&#039;s no difference. There are no distinct genres anymore.

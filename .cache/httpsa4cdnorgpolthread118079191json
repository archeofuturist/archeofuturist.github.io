Ryan&#039;s bill is terrible too, but Trump endorsed it because at least it was something. So at the end of the day, the bill fails, Trump gets to play the &quot;well we tried&quot; card, the base grumbles a little, Trump&#039;s reputation takes a small hit, Ryan looks like a complete failure, and everyone gets more time to figure out how to *actually* fix this mess. Probably the best available outcome all things considered.","time":1490364074,"resto":118079191,"id":"V\/8WvVNu","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118083082,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)10:01:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118079696\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118079696<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Jeb will become speaker.<\/span><br>The house of representatives generally doesn&#039;t choose speakers who aren&#039;t members of the house.","time":1490364083,"resto":118079191,"id":"GjyaqtCm","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118083086,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)10:01:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118082907\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118082907<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;our campsites<\/span><br><br>Hahahahaha!!!

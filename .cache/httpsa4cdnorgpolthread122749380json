Some discussions may be about the United States, but this thread is meant as an extension of \/ptg\/ to discuss and support similar movements across the rest of the world. This thread may also serve to discuss the fight between nationalists and antifa, who are globalist puppets.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Who are the globalists?<\/span><br>Anyone that wants to see decreased national sovereignty and see the elites rule instead of the people. It can be the EU, it can be the deep state, it can be communists that believe in internationalism, or it can be (((them))).

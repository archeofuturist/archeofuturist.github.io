She was sent down to the principal&#039;s office for telling her teacher\/class, that, &quot;WWII isn&#039;t what the books tell them it is&quot;. <br><br>Upon her teachers further questioning, she basically tells them all that WWII was a fake war to create an excuse to make Israel &quot;for the Jews&quot; so we could &quot;use Israel and the Jews make shady oil deals and dump lots of money into budgets for wars over it&quot;. <br><br>Now, I&#039;m clearly paraphrasing, as to save time, but her principal was verbatim quoting her, for the better part of a half hour phone call, based on what her teacher relayed to the office. <br><br>As if it couldn&#039;t get any better, the final straw that got her sent to the office was when she, &quot;so matter-of-factly claimed&quot; (as her teacher said) that, &quot;Japs thank us for nuking them, now&quot;, as she then calls out an Asian boy in her class (who she&#039;s actually been friends with since kindergarten) looking for him to back her up,. She said, &quot;tell them. Tell them you Japs don&#039;t hate us for the nukes&quot;. He apparently replied that he &quot;wouldn&#039;t know&quot; because he&#039;s &quot;Chinese&quot;. <br><br>I mean, can&#039;t blame her for trying, right? Can ANYONE actually tell the fucking difference?<br><br>So now, I&#039;ll be in her office w\/ her principal, the 6th grade guidance counselor and her teacher, at 8:30 on Monday morning. How do I spin this to save her ass w\/ the school, save myself from not looking completely blue pilled myself (because we ALL know she&#039;s RIGHT) AND possibly red pill the admin, in the process? It&#039;s a lofty goal, but someone&#039;s gotta do it...","filename":"image","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":720,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1493498614574,"time":1493498614,"md5":"wtIoA+GNkJ9MAWPvvf5bMQ==","fsize":115823,"resto":0,"id":"WgtDaBpi","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"put-your-parenting-hats-on-pol-its-us-vs-my","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

It&#039;s disgusting how every election since Nixon has depended on the whims of these nationwrecking shills. Still, he did what he had to do, which was basically kiss their asses harder than HRC and the rest of the GOP establishment.<br><br>On the plus side, he did create a divide among them by forcing a choice between their new self-professed goy #1 ally and their old establishment cronies. But it seems that they are slowly consolidating and asserting their own agendas again. The question now is what he will do next to distract or neutralize them, if ever. \/Ourguy Bannon is getting sidelined by (((Kushner))), who is near untouchable as both Trump&#039;s #2 man and family. The only effective strategy I see is to somehow work some social engineering through Ivanka. She seems to respond to &quot;won&#039;t somebody think of the children!?!?&quot; type propaganda. Maybe bombard her media relations contact with stories of Israel&#039;s atrocities against Palestinian children to the point where she starts heckling Kushner to take a few steps back from the AIPAC agenda. Now I&#039;m not some mudslime sympathizer but what we need is to create divisions between the globalists behind the scenes and this is as good a shot as any","time":1493181277,"resto":122840795,"id":"mgw5mR2P","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]}

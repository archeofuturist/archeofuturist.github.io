They have campaigns and stuff for taking in tens of thousands of refugees to completely displace their native population. Note also that Iceland is literally a country of cucks. When Iceland was occupied by the allies in WW2, over 50% of all women of breeding age fraternized with the occupying forces (Brits and American soldiers). This resulted in a large number of children being born during the war and the years after being documented as the sons of Brits and Americans, and a far greater number being the result of affairs that married Icelandic women had with invader soldiers. Many of the ancient paternal family lines that had been in the country for 1200 years ago died out because of this when Icelandic women chose to have mongrel children instead of Icelandic ones.","time":1491640306,"resto":120103565,"id":"Qppq9gfk","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"}]}

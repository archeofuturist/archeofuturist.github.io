Since they took the title belt of best jihadist from the broken and scattered Al queda, there has not been any noticeable upswing in terrorism on US soil. We have had attacks, but no more than when Al queda was the only global jihadi group of note. What ISIS gives us is a specific region where jihadis can travel to wage holy war far from our shores. The fact that they have seized land, gives them the hope that they can actually achieve success in this life, not just in their false paradise. The people they are fighting are not friends of the US either, so the best we can hope for is a protracted, contained, bloody conflict that will continue to attract muslims to come die on behalf of Isis or there enemies.","time":1493787795,"resto":123869051,"id":"+1MafGin","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123875441,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)01:14:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123874392\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123874392<\/a><br>https:\/\/en.m.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Oil<wbr>_production_and_smuggling_in_ISIL<br><br>You can search more articles from a variety of sources that say the same thing.

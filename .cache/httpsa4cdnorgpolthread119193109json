Our goal as server administrators, is to encourage and facilitate a functional political simulation, where players are free to collaborate in factions and align themselves along ideological lines. This is not so much a PvP factions server, as much as it is a political simulation server. However, PvP and faction warfare will be certainly prevalent. <br><br>IP: the.paradigmfactions.com<br><br>We\u2019ve chosen Minecraft for a server like this, specifically because the game is extremely versatile and easily accessible for a lot of people, (considering many people own minecraft). We have a lot of options here, so I hope it&#039;s easy for all of you to excuse the negative connotations surrounding the game. <br><br>We&#039;ve refined Paradigm Factions with a lot of plugins, which hopefully serve to make the base game more entertaining. For example, we have included a range of selectable ideologies, have limited PvP enchantments to a max of (III) to discourage grinding, a greentext plugin, and a dynamic market based off calculated supply and demand. <br><br>Rules:<br>[1] No raiding, killing, griefing or declaring war on other official factions without valid political reason(s).<br>[2] No cheating, or using hacks. This includes exploits.<br>[3] Role-play according to your political ideology.<br>[4] Be honest with admins.<br>[5] Annoying use of the chat will not be tolerated.<br>[6] Excessive destruction of the world\/player built structures, will result in minor punishments.<br>(there are no rules against griefing, but be reasonable.)<br><br>If one thing you&#039;re worried about is how pay2win this server is, I can assure you 100% that this server is a non-profit, and not a single donation perk will involve serious in game items of any sort of bullshit advantage. Donations will be purely cosmetic. Furthermore, dontations will only go towards funding the server. Every cent.","filename":"Paradigm","ext":".png","w":1122,"h":660,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":147,"tim":1491134879108,"time":1491134879,"md5":"JIL3hterD\/DlHg1RFj1Sug==","fsize":579059,"resto":0,"id":"YhJJCkl9","country":"CA","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"autism-blox-political-roleplay-paradigm","country_name":"Canada","replies":14,"images":2,"unique_ips":5},{"no":119193214,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)08:09:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119193109\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119193109<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;no declaring war <\/span><br><br> Dropped","time":1491134976,"resto":119193109,"id":"MGdg+0E9","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119193352,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)08:11:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119193214\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119193214<\/a><br>read it more closely dimwit.","time":1491135090,"resto":119193109,"id":"YhJJCkl9","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119193650,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)08:15:47","name":"Anonymous","filename":"2017-04-02_08.13.37","ext":".png","w":1360,"h":705,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":64,"tim":1491135347864,"time":1491135347,"md5":"w7c9rFKIM1jee5mI2TthVQ==","fsize":589487,"resto":119193109,"id":"YhJJCkl9","country":"CA","m_img":1,"country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119193809,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)08:18:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;yfw AnCap is the only winning ideology as all others are too busy squabbling inside their own faction<\/span>","time":1491135486,"resto":119193109,"id":"nZw1xvgr","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119193927,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)08:19:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119193809\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119193809<\/a><br>You&#039;d be surprised at how well commies get along in this game.","filename":"2017-04-02_08.17.51","ext":".png","w":1360,"h":705,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":64,"tim":1491135590422,"time":1491135590,"md5":"96Ak51\/QofjfmCFICY3WYg==","fsize":731816,"resto":119193109,"id":"YhJJCkl9","country":"CA","m_img":1,"country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119193945,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)08:20:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"what the fuck is Spigot 1.8.8?","time":1491135606,"resto":119193109,"id":"CCTs4ANn","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119193975,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)08:20:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119193945\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119193945<\/a><br>Correct.","time":1491135632,"resto":119193109,"id":"YhJJCkl9","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119194035,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)08:21:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119193975\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119193975<\/a><br>yeah im asking what it is and where do i get it.<br>i cant join w\/o it leaf","time":1491135675,"resto":119193109,"id":"CCTs4ANn","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119194173,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)08:23:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119194035\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119194035<\/a><br>You just need to downgrade to 1.8.8, no need to install anything, bong.","time":1491135797,"resto":119193109,"id":"YhJJCkl9","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119194340,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)08:25:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119194173\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119194173<\/a><br>euch, dont generalise me with those english barbarians south of my border","time":1491135949,"resto":119193109,"id":"CCTs4ANn","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119194484,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)08:27:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119194340\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119194340<\/a><br>well, at least they wear pants.","time":1491136079,"resto":119193109,"id":"YhJJCkl9","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119195382,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)08:41:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"bump","time":1491136878,"resto":119193109,"id":"YhJJCkl9","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119197177,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)09:06:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119193109\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119193109<\/a><br>this server shithot desu<br>\/pol\/land mk.2 without the autism","time":1491138372,"resto":119193109,"id":"CCTs4ANn","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119197721,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)09:13:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119193109\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119193109<\/a><br>Bumping, this seems fun","time":1491138805,"resto":119193109,"id":"0+Yv8Ie+","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"}]}

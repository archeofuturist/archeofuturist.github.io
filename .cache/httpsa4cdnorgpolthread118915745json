However she became upset and said I was being sexist, assume she would want to learn to cook. She insisted I get her the new iPad Pro instead, so she could learn how to code. They started a Black Girls Code club (http:\/\/www.blackgirlscode.com) at her school and she just joined (even though she&#039;s only half black). I really think she should learn to cook though, since my wife isn&#039;t teaching her (she can barely cook herself).<br><br>What do you think? Which should I get her? Also, how do I appease my wife? She&#039;s still quite upset, and when she gets like this, she tends to withhold sex, so I&#039;d like to get this solved ASAP!","filename":"B001DI4VN0-1-lg[1]","ext":".jpg","w":900,"h":553,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":153,"tim":1490876588482,"time":1490876588,"md5":"q8rcJKsnj1aPUtOhrxS8fQ==","fsize":50788,"resto":0,"id":"2Lx7aQz1","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"is-it-sexist-to-assume-girls-want-to-learn-how-to","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":4,"images":0,"unique_ips":5},{"no":118915813,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)08:24:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"Subtle.","time":1490876647,"resto":118915745,"id":"8s4z39rU","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":118915824,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)08:24:21","name":"Sage","com":"<a href=\"#p118915745\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118915745<\/a><br><br>Sage goes in all fields, boys.","time":1490876661,"resto":118915745,"id":"BPNVME+6","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118916007,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)08:27:11","name":"SAGE","com":"SAGE YOU FUCKING COMMIE FAGGOT","time":1490876831,"resto":118915745,"id":"wNH\/4EWw","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118916523,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)08:35:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118915745\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118915745<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;her 10 year old daughter<\/span><br><br>Gotchya..

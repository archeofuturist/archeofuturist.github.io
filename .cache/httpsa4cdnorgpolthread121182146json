They had them up for auction on the deepweb for a million bitcoins (~575 million USD). No one paid so they dumped some of the tools last weekend after Trump attacked Syria. The tools all exploited old vulnerabilities, as far back as 2003. They also released a message implying that they&#039;re ex-deep state and they&#039;re pissed Trump is becoming a globalist.","filename":"kek","ext":".jpg","w":2046,"h":1688,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":206,"tim":1492239139859,"time":1492239139,"md5":"NKewQjrFldJGdj0JOLzSbg==","fsize":634965,"resto":0,"id":"PhNLSPb5","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":1,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"shadow-brokers-dump-holy-shit","country_name":"United States","replies":303,"images":67,"unique_ips":140,"tail_size":50},{"no":121182191,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)02:52:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121182146\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121182146<\/a><br>FAST FORWARD TO TODAY<br><br>Today&#039;s dump: https:\/\/github.com\/x0rz\/EQGRP_Lost_<wbr>in_Translation<br><br>Today&#039;s message: https:\/\/steemit.com\/shadowbrokers\/@<wbr>theshadowbrokers\/lost-in-translatio<wbr>n<br><br>The Shadow Group released another dump, this time with some fucking juicy ass shit. Last week was old vulnerabilities, this week they dumped EIGHT NEW ZERO-DAY VULNS IN WINDOWS. That means anyone can download the tools and own any Windows machine connected to the Internet right now. Why isn&#039;t \/pol\/ and \/baph\/ all over this shit? We could be hacking the ADL right now. Also, it was revealed that the NSA hacked into the SWIFT network and set up backdoors to monitor financial translations. The NSA knew about the theft of their tools 96 days ago, yet the vulns released today proves the NSA failed to tell Microsoft about the vulns and possible leaks, oops! Their message contained the word Kek and the password to the encrypted files was REEEEEEEEE, so I think it&#039;s obvious the Shadow Brokers are one of us.

He&#039;s primed to fuck over the Deepstate.<br><br>https:\/\/twitter.com\/AP\/status\/85208<wbr>4955219996672<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;BREAKING: AP investigation finds about 2,000 allegations of sexual misconduct, exploitation against UN peacekeepers and personnel.<\/span><br>From 2 days ago.<br><br>Deepstate is worried the pedo network will be exposed. They&#039;re panicking. Just as it became apparent that The Day of the Sun wasn&#039;t going to bear any fruit, the &quot;Shadow Brokers&quot; aka CIA\/Deepstate subsidiary leaked zero-day exploits for windows. Using these tools, people can remotely gain access to computers and manipulate files inside. This will give the plausible deniability that the elite and Deepstate need - &quot;Oh, these 800TB of child porn featuring my own children and my dick? I was obviously framed by hackers using these new zero-day exploits&quot;.<br><br>Deepstate keeps trying to manipulate Trump. Trump sidesteps. Deepstate panics and tries again. Trump sidesteps. Now the Deepstate is trying to give padding to their upcoming fall. It&#039;s still on. It&#039;s still happening.","filename":"5Sk8lWhN_lgVDVxvnSNPulST7c06i8jk5nJzbHk_iYE","ext":".jpg","w":783,"h":768,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":122,"tim":1492246789294,"time":1492246789,"md5":"VdfXSs9+H+Zk5TuS+le1yw==","fsize":196411,"resto":121182146,"id":"rnRzUAqK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121190550,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)04:59:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121190305\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121190305<\/a><br>To be fair there&#039;s no proof of what you say and any number of people can prove that there was covert exfiltration of data from their machines.<br><br>Also we know about management engines, every computer made in the last decade or so has a hardware backdoor.<br><br>My point is, once these tools are out there it&#039;s retarded for the NSA or CIA or whoever to persecute people for obtaining them.

In addition, China lacks globally positioned bases for forward deployment. China&#039;s rank structure concentrates small unit C&amp;C within the officer corps and has an underdeveloped NCO corps due to conscription turnover; compared to the US which has doctrinal tradition of empowering NCO&#039;s, building experience through retention by virtue of an All-Volunteer Force.

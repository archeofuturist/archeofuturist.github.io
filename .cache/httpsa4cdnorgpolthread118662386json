We huddled together in the central part of the basement, shaking with fear, while some peeked through the low basement windows to see what was happening on the Soviet-controlled street. We felt paralyzed by the sight of these husky Mongolians, looking wild and frightening. At the ruin across the street from us the first Soviet orders were posted, including a curfew. Suddenly there was a shattering noise outside. Horrified, we watched the Soviets demolish the corner grocery store and throw its contents, shelving and furniture out into the street. Urgently needed bags of flour, sugar and rice were split open and spilled their contents on the bare pavement, while Soviet soldiers stood guard with their rifles so that no one would dare to pick up any of the urgently needed food. This was just unbelievable. At night, a few desperate people tried to salvage some of the spilled food from the gutter. Hunger now became a major concern because our ration cards were worthless with no hope of any supplies.&quot; -1945, witness","time":1490717139,"resto":118662386,"id":"ua4ieTD0","country":"BA","country_name":"Bosnia and Herzegovina"},{"no":118663024,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)12:06:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118662386\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118662386<\/a><br>How many German women do you guys think he raped?","time":1490717169,"resto":118662386,"id":"Nqk95Yoy","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118663066,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)12:06:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118662386\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118662386<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;germans were beaten by this<\/span>","filename":"The liberators","ext":".jpg","w":2907,"h":1840,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":79,"tim":1490717191564,"time":1490717191,"md5":"JsfF8YQ2lJH\/ma3pv5PbhQ==","fsize":1908297,"resto":118662386,"id":"khmf+huX","country":"RU","m_img":1,"country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":118663335,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)12:09:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118662386\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118662386<\/a><br>So, what is so strange or unusual about that?","time":1490717359,"resto":118662386,"id":"ceTXmWo3","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":118663489,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)12:10:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118663024\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118663024<\/a><br>every single one got RICED","time":1490717436,"resto":118662386,"id":"lTBjlTIe","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118663505,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)12:10:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118662386\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118662386<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;beaten<\/span><br>More like collapsed under the weight of their dead bodies.","time":1490717449,"resto":118662386,"id":"2p\/CRWRV","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":118663629,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)12:11:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;russians were beaten by this<\/span>","filename":"Simo_hayha5[1]","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":274,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":68,"tim":1490717501547,"time":1490717501,"md5":"MIwISEOYas25KYO3ppzcvQ==","fsize":27588,"resto":118662386,"id":"bwN+bMRE","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":118663703,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)12:12:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"Ruskies love their asian brothers, they are 35% mongolian after all.","filename":"brothers","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":476,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":99,"tim":1490717545746,"time":1490717545,"md5":"xc+I6+JZ9G\/XExTTHXr7iw==","fsize":32947,"resto":118662386,"id":"ua4ieTD0","country":"BA","country_name":"Bosnia and Herzegovina"},{"no":118663902,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)12:14:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118663703\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118663703<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Lenin was 1\/4 Mongol<\/span>","time":1490717654,"resto":118662386,"id":"fPo3XPs+","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":118663906,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)12:14:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118663629\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118663629<\/a><br><br>He is looking on me so scary.","time":1490717654,"resto":118662386,"id":"hYQEcanT","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"}]}

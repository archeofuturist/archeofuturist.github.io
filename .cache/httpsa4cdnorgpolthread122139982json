This general is for the discussion of Marxism-Leninism, the ideology of revolutionary socialism and communism.<br><br>Communism is the next stage of humanity following the capitalist stage.<br><br>What exactly is communism according to Marxist-Leninists:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Communism is a stage of society in which the productive infrastructure is socially owned, and goods are produced not in order to sell for profit, but in order to meet a social need.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Communism in it&#039;s full form is a stateless, classless society that follows the maxim &quot;From each according to their ability, to each according to their need.&quot;<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;To achieve such a society Marxism-Leninism teaches us that we must replace the capitalist state, which is controlled by the capitalist class, by a socialist state, which is controlled by the working class. Then, a period of class struggle follows in which the capitalist class is liquidated by the working class. When the capitalist class has been completely vanquished, there will be only one class, the working class, and eventually the functions of the state will become indistinguishable from the functions of the society as a whole, and the state as such will &#039;wither away&#039;

i learned communists make excellent compost.<br><br>I was driving home after a long day at the office and at a busy intersection, a bunch of coons, chinks and pasty fat kids were blocking the road with communist propaganda signs and an arm-link fence. this was the 4th time in 3 months. it was time to do something about it.<br><br>I got out, walked to the back of my car, and tore my license plate straight off. I then got back in, put on my driving shades, and hit the gas. the shrieks of terror and the thumping of their now-dead bodies colliding with my vehicle were the stuff of nightmares. apparently the sight of so many of their members being killed in the line of duty scared off the rest of those filthy stalinists, because before i knew it, anyone whose head was not splattered against the bumper of my car was now running for the hills, screaming all the way.<br><br>I had no idea if anyone had called the police in the ensuing panic yet, so i rightfully decided to book it. as i was running to the back of my car to try and reaffix the license plate in case any potential cops on the way home took notice, i thought to myself, &quot;i can&#039;t walk away from something this big without some kind of souvenir.&quot; At first i thought id take one of their signs, but that would be too big to hide. Then i saw it: a severed hand, torn straight from the arm of some red cunt. At this point, i decided i&#039;d do something interesting with it. You see, i had a small chili plant i kept on my windowsill that i felt hadn&#039;t received any type of nutrition for a long time, and seeing how worthless communists inherently are, i decided it was time that one of them was given a purpose in life. I wrapped the hand in some tissues, and when i got home, i lifted the pepper with all the dirt out of the pot and placed the hand at the bottom. to this day, those are the damn best tasting peppers ive ever had.","filename":"enough","ext":".gif","w":350,"h":233,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1492785350203,"time":1492785350,"md5":"zX86fnbohvWvNAp9ONlcag==","fsize":356572,"resto":122139982,"id":"YGNDTJaH","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122141901,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)10:37:35","name":"Anonymous","filename":"027352a947f33f69b19df5f1df1b4a2a38d5d64ce2dc14837062aa94d7f52baa","ext":".png","w":686,"h":915,"tn_w":93,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492785455556,"time":1492785455,"md5":"4LQIaeBud+hRIwTzJjMTWw==","fsize":706112,"resto":122139982,"id":"1HyL\/rpQ","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":122142514,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)10:43:15","name":"Anonymous","filename":"1483331868179","ext":".png","w":900,"h":2648,"tn_w":42,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492785795647,"time":1492785795,"md5":"hDL4eH00GoXQaIm\/rA\/7Lg==","fsize":3955516,"resto":122139982,"id":"1HyL\/rpQ","country":"ES","m_img":1,"country_name":"Spain"},{"no":122142872,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)10:46:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122139982\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122139982<\/a><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=BN7<wbr>FpwAa-Ls","time":1492785965,"resto":122139982,"id":"xpEmybwF","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":122143387,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)10:50:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122140444\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122140444<\/a><br>jagdtiger because i have a small dick","time":1492786224,"resto":122139982,"id":"AClxNsVk","country":"RO","country_name":"Romania"},{"no":122144349,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)10:59:13","name":"Anonymous","filename":"1483659952212","ext":".jpg","w":737,"h":802,"tn_w":114,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492786753354,"time":1492786753,"md5":"sLJj07NHy3\/K8k9FMiEfUA==","fsize":81570,"resto":122139982,"id":"1HyL\/rpQ","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":122144823,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)11:03:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"Communism and socialism are cancer.

We would be mistaken to claim that the antiquated speculative nature of Fashwave betrays the aesthetic as a thing only predicated on nostalgia. While it might be considered a collage of sorts, stitched together from pieces of 80s and 90s pop-culture; VHS tapes, video game soundtracks, neo-noir landscapes, neon, lasers, synthesizers, streaking brake lights and 8-bit arpeggios\u2014Fashwave only operates modally to subvert the mainstream progressive agenda by way of nostalgic cues to the otherwise uninterested.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The real strength and fascination of the aesthetic lies in its ability to draw a parallel between anachronistic futurisms; that is to say, what ideals were once held for tomorrow and have since fallen either out of favor, out of fashion, or out of plausibility\u2014and icons of western art now so unpopular in the mainstream circles of acceptable media. Hovercrafts, jetpacks, Bond gadgets, terminator technology, apocalyptic analogues\u2014dreams made into memories.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;By carefully conflating these two ideas we might touch on the birth of a new mannerism: anachronism becomes the mode by which the canon of western thought and artistic enterprise suddenly and altogether vaults over the rhetorical barriers set in place by post-modernism and manned tirelessly by the drones of academia, to re-establishes itself as a countercultural force.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;So it was that Piranesi\u2019s Veduta di Roma series painted an image of Rome so fantastical that Goethe himself\u2014a fan of Piranesi\u2019s work\u2014exclaimed his consuming disappointment upon first visiting the city, for it was less impressive than Piranesi\u2019s drawings had led him to dream.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Let us continue dreaming.<\/span>","filename":"1490753730488","ext":".jpg","w":1920,"h":1200,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":156,"tim":1490886271272,"time":1490886271,"md5":"X9KIm3DYFVmLCDjfPQdRSA==","fsize":1087646,"resto":0,"id":"k74RA75X","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"fashwave-general-call-to-action-edition","country_name":"United States","replies":7,"images":4,"unique_ips":3},{"no":118928819,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)11:05:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"INCLUDED CONTENT IS CERTIFIED SAUCY<br>KEEP SEATBELT FASTENED AT ALL TIMES.<br><br>ARTIST - CONTENT<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;SOUNDCLOUD<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;YT LINK<\/span><br><br>COSMODEUS (Releasing fashy tracks on a monthly basis)<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;https:\/\/soundcloud.com\/cosmodeus<\/span><br>NEWEST TRACK POSTED INSPIRED BY BERKELEY STICKMAN<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;https:\/\/soundcloud.com\/cosmodeus\/a<wbr>wake-in-an-event-horizon-am-i<\/span><br><br>AIRGLOW - MEMORY BANK<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=E4<wbr>eCs4twfco [Embed]<\/span><br><br>ALEX DAVIDSON - MAINFRAME<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=2c<wbr>OrdPutSOU [Embed]<\/span><br><br>DROID BISHOP - BEYOND THE BLUE<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=KV<wbr>uZ-a9kjKc&amp;t=551s [Embed] <\/span><br><br>DROID BISHOP - THE IRRELEVANCE OF SPACE AND TIME<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=sJ<wbr>o0SdUecZQ [Embed] <\/span><br><br>DROID BISHOP - ELECTRIC LOVE<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=zh<wbr>Cb8Z4OQqc [Embed]<\/span><br><br>DUETTE - BORDERLINE<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=dU<wbr>drFq0LaGw&amp;list=PLtulLfjaXBN0aPrAQa6<wbr>1pbfXdqqO7EcBD [Embed] <\/span><br><br>FM-84 - ATLAS<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=rS<wbr>GnNMnvM6M [Embed] <\/span><br><br>KAVINSKY - OUTRUN<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=9g<wbr>nqavgWWqU&amp;list=PLJJbgs-F6xmsVDo6pyG<wbr>0Dk_wESACG1S94 [Embed] <\/span><br><br>LOST YEARS - BLACK WAVES<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Gi<wbr>9tJ8QoBus [Embed] <\/span><br><br>OGRE - 194<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=rw<wbr>nml285CaM&amp;list=PL_h60bzfy9KV8ibbGWe<wbr>7xBP8asL5wLHEy [Embed] <\/span><br><br>OGRE - 195<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=jE<wbr>CMuzD9BzQ [Embed]<\/span>","filename":"1484154669087","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":663,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":80,"tim":1490886344292,"time":1490886344,"md5":"qvFRY2s62GkzBTy4CdkwMA==","fsize":254250,"resto":118928714,"id":"k74RA75X","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118928857,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)11:06:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"PilotPriest - WWDKF<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;No Link, don&#039;t want to go straight to the artist&#039;s bandcamp.

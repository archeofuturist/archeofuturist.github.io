Nation = population, not state. A nationalist would gladly and fervently overturn the state and replace it with a new one if he thought that was what was best for his people. Most nationalism is racial nationalism. So a white racial nationalist might help destroy the US government\/state if he thought that was what white people needed to happen.","time":1492985624,"resto":122491906,"id":"0ZdIMPeD","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

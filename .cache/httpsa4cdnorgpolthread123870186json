For the last year and half \/pol\/ has been dominating the media, and recently we have been able to control entire poltiical narratives (O.K., #firecolbert). Im worried that ideas like national socialism and white nationalism will creep there way into the mainstream with the new shifting overton window.<br><br>I think is pretty obvious that we are living in the most turbulent time since the 60s with widespread political violence and the normalizing of extremist politics both left and right. <br><br>Im worried that some the ideas that are popular on here will start to seep into the mainstream, things like race realism, white nationalism, as well the all important JQ.<br><br>We can mostly agree that all three of these positions have merit, but are the normies ready for it? Are the normies ready to fight and die in a race war or a nationalist v. communist civil war?<br><br>Essentially im worried that the normies are getting redpilled &quot;too fast&quot;, and it won&#039;t end well.<br><br><br>What is the end goal? Are we truly trying to destory crash this system with no survivors?","filename":"FsDrg0BoZ3ZnJTZbVTKF6JdEovJ-zSva1A3mmYdc9_4","ext":".png","w":811,"h":767,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":236,"tim":1493785103497,"time":1493785103,"md5":"4UcRqSORpA\/eHVt1oDjyeA==","fsize":423232,"resto":0,"id":"5WQ7E\/Sw","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"guys-im-starting-to-get-worried-for-the-last-year","country_name":"United States","replies":16,"images":4,"unique_ips":14},{"no":123870286,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)00:19:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123870186\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123870186<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;#firecolbert<\/span><br><br>So youve been here for an hour","time":1493785174,"resto":123870186,"id":"xmCrAAcv","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123870295,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)00:19:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123870186\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123870186<\/a><br>Daily Dose:<br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/detM0cKxWro<br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/oBSvUlkB61s","filename":"56137377_p0","ext":".png","w":636,"h":900,"tn_w":88,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493785178982,"time":1493785178,"md5":"bkWVmEY8I3ElNzLUI815dg==","fsize":239193,"resto":123870186,"id":"TnaFU\/xk","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123870437,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)00:21:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"Don&#039;t worry the left can&#039;t fight, it will end up being a total disaster for them.

All I can say is I&#039;ve never gone hungry and have led a fairly easy life, nowhere is perfect though and there&#039;s always plenty to worry and complain about. Sure we have an abundance of natural resources, significant military might and economic power which are both deterrent against other powers, and our Constitution provides many freedoms because out founders were idealists but our current government however doesn&#039;t those ideals as dearly. It often seems as if they&#039;re doing their best to subvert those rights, the vast tracks of land set aside for conservationism and public use are being chipped away at to setve coorprate interests polluting the water and the land in the process, corruption is commonplace though perhaps more subtle than elsewhere where the ruling class isn&#039;t so handicapped by laws meant to prevent such things, our public infustructure is crumbling, public services are pretty lacking in comparison to many other places, and even things like being able to retire one day no longer seems a certainty.","time":1490600927,"resto":118480648,"id":"iUDs3bdy","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118487886,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)03:50:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118480924\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118480924<\/a><br>You lost your championship belt on 1776, bong.","time":1490601029,"resto":118480648,"id":"JOfNyu+7","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118487966,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)03:51:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118486694\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118486694<\/a><br>If all anglos answered the call we&#039;d be living on a peaceful white only planet.","time":1490601109,"resto":118480648,"id":"TaoRTLc8","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118488030,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)03:52:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118487593\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118487593<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;agrees we invaded multiple countries entirely for jewish wealth gains<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;demands proof other similar operations arent legitimate US populace interests<\/span>","time":1490601175,"resto":118480648,"id":"pi74CsN+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118488099,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)03:54:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118487966\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118487966<\/a><br>getting kind of blackpilled on anglos<br><br>they seem to be the eternal attack dog of the jew, so glad im germanic in heritage so i dont have to hang myself in shame","time":1490601250,"resto":118480648,"id":"pi74CsN+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118488201,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)03:55:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118487886\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118487886<\/a><br><br>1776 is what spawned the empire.","time":1490601358,"resto":118480648,"id":"zKaIGTv9","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118488288,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)03:57:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118487769\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118487769<\/a><br>yeah but as it is not something trump is about to do, they will continue to develop themselves independently and I bet in Two decades India and China beat the fuck off america","time":1490601451,"resto":118480648,"id":"rwM9+JJ2","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":118488556,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)04:01:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118480648\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118480648<\/a><br>America is great<br>but in recent times and really ever since nam we&#039;ve gone downhill.<br>we got defeated and we have been shaking are heads about it since then <br>and the leftys have been laughing at us <br>the domino did start to fall <br><br>but.<br>WE have the most potential to come out of this dark time.<br>We have the power to do it and most decent Americans are just looking for the signal to strike back.<br><br>Trump is the first action of this built up anger Americans have at the world.<br>We are tried of being called fat, lazy and controlled. <br>Soon the day will come where the world respects America again <br>Soon the day will come <br>You are not Wrong jap bro <br>You are a great ally in this culture war we have before us <br>I pray a big war dose not come.<br>But are enemy should pray more.","filename":"JapanUSAgreatally","ext":".jpg","w":800,"h":537,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1490601717848,"time":1490601717,"md5":"7VX5x7WGB+G9v4a5NU21PA==","fsize":81739,"resto":118480648,"id":"3faF4y1E","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

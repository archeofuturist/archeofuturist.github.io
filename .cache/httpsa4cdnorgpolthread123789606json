You might remember last week about how BAMN, America\u2019s worst organizers of left wing violence, are connected to NAMBLA. Today we broke another story, about how BAMN schoolteachers groom children and organize them for political purposes. http:\/\/dailycaller.com\/2017\/04\/28\/d<wbr>ocuments-tie-berkeley-riot-organize<wbr>rs-to-pro-pedophilia-group-nambla\/ http:\/\/dailycaller.com\/2017\/05\/02\/s<wbr>chool-district-berkeley-riot-organi<wbr>zers-tried-to-brainwash-students-in<wbr>to-left-wing-activism-video\/ Berkeley mayor Jesse Arreguin, who told the police to stand down, associates with BAMN. BAMN organizer Yvette Felarca is the harpy who was on Tucker bragging about assaulting Trump supporters in Berkeley. <br><br>BAMN organizes rallies to attack Trump supporters and patriots. It&#039;s time to attack back. <br><br>We know that BAMN uses illegal immigrants as political organizers. This is where you come in, \/pol\/. We want to find these illegal immigrants and report them to ICE. We need help identifying their current locations so that we can deport them. We suspect that BAMN runs a safe house near Berkeley and a safe house near Detroit.<br><br>cont&#039;d.","filename":"Yvette_Felarca","ext":".jpg","w":584,"h":415,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":177,"tim":1493745111304,"time":1493745111,"md5":"868HpF56aCxdiLxI0N+lPw==","fsize":81792,"resto":0,"id":"QY0nK2Zo","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"pol-antifaleaks-needs-your-help-finding-some","trip":"!!TYQoaqfDdAi","country_name":"United States","replies":5,"images":4,"unique_ips":3},{"no":123789743,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)13:13:00","name":"Antifaleaks","com":"<a href=\"#p123789606\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123789606<\/a><br>Jose Alverenga was arrested in 2015 for protesting at the University of Michigan: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=EIt<wbr>m6EkjDxc Jose was deported, even though he proudly calls himself illegal.

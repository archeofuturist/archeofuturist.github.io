How?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;However, Colbert admitted, \u201cI sir, am no John Dickerson\u201d \u2014quick aside: Don\u2019t you just HATE when people use the word \u201csir\u201d as a means to levy a condescending attack?\u2014 before he unleashed a string of insults, including \u201cMr. President, I love your presidency, I call it \u2018Disgrace The Nation,\u2019\u201d and \u201cYou\u2019re the \u2018presi-dunce\u2019 but you\u2019re turning into a real \u2018prick-tator.\u201d (Fast forward to roughly the 10:25 mark of this video.)<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;But then he went about as brutal as we\u2019ve ever really seen Colbert get, continuing, \u201cSir, you attract more skinheads than free Rogaine. You have more people marching against you than cancer. You talk like a sign-language gorilla that got hit in the head.\u201d<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;And then Colbert finished it off with the most scathing line of them all: \u201cIn fact, the only thing your mouth is good for is being Vladimir Putin\u2019s cock holster,\u201d which elicited gasps from the studio audience.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Lobbing jokes at the President of the United States, be they Democrat or Republican, is a time-honored late night monologue tradition. Partisan critiquing of the President\u2019s policies is a relatively new facet of late night monologues (at least those on broadcast TV), but one that has undeniably led to increased ratings and relevance for hosts like Stephen Colbert, Seth Meyers, and others. However, using a derogatory, homophobic slur like\u201ccock holster\u201dto denigrate the rightfully elected leader of our nation seems like a step way, way too far. In a misguided attempt to defend his friend and fellow Tiffany Network employee, Colbert\u2019s blustery bravado regressed from pointed punnery into nasty schoolyard bullying, embarrassing himself, his staff, his network and everyone that watches his show<\/span><br><br>http:\/\/decider.com\/2017\/05\/02\/steph<wbr>en-colbert-donald-trump-cock-holste<wbr>r\/<br><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/HaHwlSTqA7s","filename":"1492635824368","ext":".jpg","w":515,"h":482,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":233,"tim":1493753617241,"time":1493753617,"md5":"KsgcaONOtr1jfD+x54k75A==","fsize":79258,"resto":0,"id":"MVrrzcyZ","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"holy-shit-stephen-colbert-has-lost-it-with-his","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":1,"unique_ips":1},{"no":123807995,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)15:35:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"Why the fuck is this hack so popular with millenials?","filename":"1493293448408","ext":".jpg","w":320,"h":240,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1493753708891,"time":1493753708,"md5":"xjF8hh5DSNxhI4Kk6DvZPA==","fsize":27568,"resto":123807814,"id":"MVrrzcyZ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

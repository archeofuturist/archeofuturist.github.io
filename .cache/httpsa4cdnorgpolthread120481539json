Now they can have a unit of 8 or so per 200 miles. 1-2 to watch cameras and a few in rapid response units to deal with people using ladders, trying to dig tunnels under and a few miles away from the wall, still need tons more at the border checkpoints, some can join coast guard for the increased retards trying to get in by boat. This is barely anything because they still can get drugs\/illegals at checkpoints.","time":1491854489,"resto":120481539,"id":"V8zL1lng","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120483579,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)16:11:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120481539\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120481539<\/a><br>Would actually need more so the wall was actually patrolled and maintained","time":1491855098,"resto":120481539,"id":"rAFTKnjy","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

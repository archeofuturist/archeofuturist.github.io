Obviously it is the fault of the people walking on the bridge that muslims can&#039;t into civilization and it is of course not the fault of more or less radical imams who can imprint a hatred for the west into the minds of the young, especially muslims born in the west who&#039;s parents never took the effort to integrate into their host societies and because of poor choices now live in poverty and have a bad life.

It was of course possible to utter heresies of a very crude kind, a species of <br>blasphemy. It would have been possible, for example, to say BIG BROTHER IS UNGOOD. But this statement, which to an orthodox ear merely conveyed a self-evident absurdity, could not have been sustained by reasoned argument, because the necessary words were not available. Ideas inimical to Ingsoc could only be entertained in a vague wordless form, and could only be named in very broad terms which lumped together and condemned whole groups of heresies without defining them in doing so. One could, in fact, only use Newspeak for unorthodox purposes by <br> llegitimately translating some of the words back into Oldspeak. For example, ALL MANS ARE EQUAL was a possible Newspeak <br>sentence, but only in the same sense in which ALL MEN ARE REDHAIRED is a possible Oldspeak sentence. It did not contain a grammatical error, but it expressed a palpa- <br>ble untruth \u2014 i.e. that all men are of equal size, weight, or strength. The concept of political equality no longer existed, and this secondary meaning had accordingly been purged out of the word EQUAL. In 1984, when Oldspeak was still the normal means of communication, the danger theoretically existed that in using Newspeak words one might remember their original meanings. In practice it was not difficult for any person well grounded in DOUBLETHINK to avoid doing this, but within a couple of generations even <br>the possibility of such a lapse would have vaished. A person growing up with Newspeak as his sole language would no more know that EQUAL had once had the secondary meaning of &#039;politically equal&#039;, or that FREE had once <br>meant &#039;intellectually free&#039;, than for instance, a person who had never heard of chess would be aware of the secondary meanings attaching to QUEEN and ROOK.","filename":"1471407599321","ext":".jpg","w":1000,"h":1258,"tn_w":99,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491796363608,"time":1491796363,"md5":"+Ucxc9LgVxY3gcLSzm2LSw==","fsize":342363,"resto":120385555,"id":"j9\/g3vL7","country":"CL","m_img":1,"country_name":"Chile"},{"no":120388345,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)23:53:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120385555\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120385555<\/a><br>This is an attack on the west.<br><br>We NEED to genocide these animals.

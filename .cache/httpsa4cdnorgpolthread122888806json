The problem is that they want to base that accusation on two chemicals they found.

Never heard of that, the most common stabilizer is tributlyamine). Now i&#039;m no CW expert but if mahmoud and his friends decided to cook up sarin in their basement they&#039;d use the easiest synthesis route (meaning there would be DIMP in their end product) and they&#039;d have to stabilize it as well if they wanted it to have a reasonable shelf live.<br><br>If you take a look at the UN report about the 2013 incidents (http:\/\/undocs.org\/A\/67\/997, page 30-37) you can see that they tested and found a shitload of other stuff, and not just its presence but also its concentrations\/the relations to other chemicals that were present. That was necessary to match some of the sarin that was used back then to be of the same stock (Khan al Assal and East ghouta), they WEREN&#039;T able to match this to be from the syrian stocks, even with the way better and more reliable (because the samples were taken by competent personal and quickly processed) data they had back then.","time":1493218237,"resto":122888806,"id":"hnm\/cqyL","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":122891308,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)10:51:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122889910\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122889910<\/a><br>Thats Houthi Slogan Bro..<br>Houthis are Zaydi Shia sect, similar to Sunni but they are more Strict and Less Tolerant than Sunni, they considered Jews as Unclean and it&#039;s okay to Gas the Jews according to them. <br>I Prefer Abu Saleh GPC rule Yemen than Houthis, yet Abu Saleh and GPC are Houthi Allies now, I guess Houthi didn&#039;t have a Plan to Rule Yemen.","time":1493218307,"resto":122888806,"id":"PPfzne6w","country":"ID","country_name":"Indonesia"},{"no":122891427,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)10:52:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122888888\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122888888<\/a>","filename":"f9b","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":421,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":105,"tim":1493218368720,"time":1493218368,"md5":"CeoOn3DV4ycS3BV0lpkkFQ==","fsize":271049,"resto":122888806,"id":"z+dRGrUn","country":"DK","country_name":"Denmark"},{"no":122891463,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)10:53:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122891187\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122891187<\/a><br>Also the presence of DIMP means that the bong and the bellingcat shill that were so convinced that the russian narrative was impossible because it must have been binary sarin precursors can go fuck themself, this proofes that wherever it came from, it was ordinary sarin with a shitty stabilizer.

If some deus ex machina mortality solution was available I&#039;d take it without second thought, that stuff in literature and movies about immortal beings getting too tired of life is just fiction which purpose is to make you feel peace with your mortality. And then of course there&#039;s also the problem of entropy in Universe, but given there&#039;s no immortality asspull solution yet it&#039;s none of our problem.<br>Oh boy, here I go on another of my ramblings again.

Believe me, it&#039;s not like I argue for the sake of being a contrarian, I really want to believe. My dad is a true believer to the bones, he says that when he was a little kid, we was out in the countryside with his grandma one summer night and something awoke him in the middle of the night. He saw shining coming from the window, and when he looked out he saw a cross in the sky that emanated gentle, moonlike light. When I asked him why he didn&#039;t wake up his grandma he said he was sure it would happen the next night, too, so he decided to wait until morning. Needless to say it didn&#039;t. I don&#039;t know, I really want to believe him but I am afraid he might&#039;ve had some problems in the head. I mean, he also claims some alien-like shit like patrolling with his squad one night when he was in military, seeing some beam of light in the woods, rushing there with his mates only to find a clear field with no light in sight and a strong smell of ozone.

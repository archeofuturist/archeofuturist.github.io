The main problem with the Conservatives is that people will fall victim and be persuaded by even lightest of faux hard words on things like immigration or UKIP. Theresa May said she would try to limit non-EU immigration while she was home secretary for example, but she utterly failed to do that, despite it being in her grasp. People actually, for some reason, completely unbased on actual real world actions believe that someone who campaigned for our membership of the EU and someone who has a track record of letting in massive amounts of immigrants will delivery on getting a good deal from the EU and reduce immigration. It is beyond ridiculous.<br><br>People who voted for independence voted first and foremost for sovereignty, but in a few years our citizens able to be dragged before a foreign court because of the european arrest warrant and we will still have immigration in the hundreds of thousands. Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but the Conservatives will not bring about the result that people wanted, and what is worse, is that now UKIP might be gone there wont be a force to push them to the right, and with Labour in the absolute state that they are in, the Tories will be able to institute their Blairite policies for perhaps another decade.","filename":"Theresa_Blair","ext":".png","w":631,"h":568,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":112,"tim":1490450991132,"time":1490450991,"md5":"V0p3Sce6wSLERd6EIWeRgw==","fsize":543051,"resto":118226634,"id":"H2gTdjU5","country":"GB","trip":"!!sD6h8LgcbfU","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118227612,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)10:09:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118227509\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118227509<\/a><br>wanker, just vote tories and stop being a fucking child about it. <br>It&#039;s time to grow up","time":1490450999,"resto":118226634,"id":"XWlPK95g","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118227668,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)10:10:37","name":"EgonSpengler","com":"<a href=\"#p118226933\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118226933<\/a><br><br>I think thats going to happen desu.","time":1490451037,"resto":118226634,"id":"ov3h8WAI","country":"GB","trip":"!lVhJLXYcPw","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118227688,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)10:10:55","name":"Rightly So","com":"<a href=\"#p118227414\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118227414<\/a><br>In the traditional, defunct political spectrum that goes from left to right, UKIP are to the right of the Conservatives.","time":1490451055,"resto":118226634,"id":"H2gTdjU5","country":"GB","trip":"!!sD6h8LgcbfU","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118227710,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)10:11:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118227306\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118227306<\/a><br>Now would be a good time to drop a few bombs desu.","time":1490451065,"resto":118226634,"id":"D+oFvI6h","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118227716,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)10:11:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"Feels weird not having a party.

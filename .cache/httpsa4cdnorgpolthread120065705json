His album cover is a painting of everyone who&#039;s inspired him, one of which is Angela Davis.<br><br>Angela Davis is an ex black panther and a hardcore communist and black nationalist. In the album cover, her fist is raised with that Communist power \/ black power sign. <br><br>I don&#039;t know what to make of this. I&#039;m a far right libertarian, I fucking hate commies. <br><br>Is Logic a communist? Is he some BLM supporter or some bullshit? Side note: he&#039;s white but African-American (don&#039;t cringe too hard \/pol\/, but he&#039;s mixed, black dad and white mom)<br><br>At the same time, he supports treating everyone equal, working hard for success, education, money -- he seems very capitalist. <br><br>I love his music but I don&#039;t know how I feel about him supporting black nationalism and COMMUNISM, mother fucking ideology that killed more people than Nazism.<br><br>What do I do \/pol\/? What do you guys think?<br><br>Pic related, he tweeted out that Pepe and it&#039;s supposed to be him (is he low key red pilled?)","filename":"logicpepe","ext":".jpg","w":1242,"h":1221,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":245,"tim":1491616164589,"time":1491616164,"md5":"YjL+lk71VJ87Q2H\/OwVVjA==","fsize":128320,"resto":0,"id":"dJlhUqZv","country":"CA","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"pol-im-having-a-crisis","country_name":"Canada","replies":8,"images":2,"unique_ips":8},{"no":120065888,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)21:50:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120065705\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120065705<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;A fucking leaf<\/span>","time":1491616240,"resto":120065705,"id":"jV9zQbN7","country":"CR","country_name":"Costa Rica"},{"no":120066205,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)21:52:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120065888\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120065888<\/a><br>fpbp","time":1491616366,"resto":120065705,"id":"37BqCjZJ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120066206,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)21:52:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120065705\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120065705<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Angela Davis is an ex black panther and a hardcore communist and black nationalist<\/span><br><br>Kill yourself for listening to such leftist cuck, leaf.","filename":"1467138760776","ext":".jpg","w":364,"h":457,"tn_w":99,"tn_h":124,"tim":1491616366963,"time":1491616366,"md5":"xASDl7AxDubTGGIjU4mJQQ==","fsize":121982,"resto":120065705,"id":"UG310JJf","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":120066225,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)21:52:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120065705\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120065705<\/a><br>Just wait for the album to come out and maybe he&#039;ll talk about his view points or what not","time":1491616377,"resto":120065705,"id":"whbuFkXm","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120066410,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)21:54:13","name":"trump supporter that opposes syria attacks","com":"<a href=\"#p120066206\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120066206<\/a><br>he hates taxes so i question if he&#039;s actually a leftist","time":1491616453,"resto":120065705,"id":"dJlhUqZv","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120066560,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)21:55:10","name":"Anonymous","filename":"IMG_4827","ext":".jpg","w":495,"h":559,"tn_w":110,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491616510726,"time":1491616510,"md5":"ZsivLEcQhSg20ASsVeFDEA==","fsize":91269,"resto":120065705,"id":"MfUqUdFN","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120066653,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)21:55:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120065705\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120065705<\/a><br>Logic is corny as fuck <br> <br>Listen to better music","time":1491616540,"resto":120065705,"id":"6VlPSQbl","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120067251,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)21:59:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120065705\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120065705<\/a><br>If you&#039;re a Trump supporter, say something bad about Muslims.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;saged to be safe<\/span>","time":1491616754,"resto":120065705,"id":"tsr9xC5j","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]}

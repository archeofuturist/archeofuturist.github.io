It generally attracts good people and the economics are not too far right or left. Nationalits go on and on about culture but liberals are the ones that produce the art, music, media, comedy, and social movements that define our history. Most people on the right are socially isolated, degenerate rural retards with poor education and this attracts the scum of the earth.<br><br>Help me here \/pol\/","filename":"1492203037864m","ext":".jpg","w":687,"h":1024,"tn_w":167,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492485639518,"time":1492485639,"md5":"x68PFw8kjMDPmAAkM2eSiw==","fsize":144731,"resto":0,"id":"emnBX0wy","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"is-liberalism-the-most-balanced-ideology-it","country_name":"Canada","replies":7,"images":3,"unique_ips":8},{"no":121630923,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)23:28:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121630016\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121630016<\/a><br>Who is this woman?

That appeals to me because it reduces the amount of power partisan groups have over people to only what the people decide. Imagine being a Bolshie just after the revolution.

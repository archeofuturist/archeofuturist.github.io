You yell at him to stop and he starts spazzing out even more, and starts flailing around like a crazy person and hits one of the other kids in the face, and so you dash over to stop him and discipline him and he sees you running at him and gets spooked and runs away and smashes his stupid kid face into a telephone pole or some shit and needs reconstructive surgery.<br><br>Obviously the kid is an autistic little piece of shit and he shouldn&#039;t have been doing any of those things, but whose fault was it, ultimately?<br><br>Yours, motherfucker. You were the authority, you were (or at least should have been) in control of the situation, it never should have gotten that bad to begin with. The kid was just acting according to his nature, shitty though it was. You had multiple chances to de-escalate the situation in a safe way and you failed.<br><br>No, it&#039;s not a perfect analogy, because the customer here was an adult, but if you&#039;ve ever had a job dealing with the public you&#039;ll know full well that doesn&#039;t mean that much. A certain % of customers are gonna chimp out, and despite my use of that verb, the ones who do can come from all races and walks of life.

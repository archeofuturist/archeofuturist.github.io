Each group wants to hear a different message and we must target them individually. Melenchon voters need to be convinced that this is an establishment vs anti-establishment vote, and that if Marine Le Pen is elected it will ruin the right and pave the way for Melenchon to take over (Bullshit, I know). This group is our main target. Fillon voters need to be reminded that Le Pen is euroskeptic, and that she will deal with the EU. Fillon voters need to be told that thier country is in danger and how France needs to be saved. Non-voters need to be memed into voting against the guy who is Hollande MK2, &#039;dated&#039; his 40 year old teacher at 15 and in in the pocket of the big banks.

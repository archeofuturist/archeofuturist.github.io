He responded to my shit post and attached a bunch of reading materials and I spent a few hours reading through it all.<br><br>I finally understand why Trump supporters are fighting to get things changed... you guys and girls are fighting because we can&#039;t afford the same bullshit over and over again and even though I might not really feel %100 confident in Trump because I just feel he&#039;s not totally honest about everything, it&#039;s more of the goals and actionable path that this administration is taking away from the same old song and dance, it&#039;s the overall message to the world and not necessarily just Trump... I just want to say that I&#039;m sorry for the shit posts and the nonsense (even though you wouldn&#039;t know me or care to know me anyway). <br><br>This anon told me he was a US army officer but I didn&#039;t get a chance to say thanks because after an Australian anon and he turned the thread into a redpill thread, it was deleted (odd). You know, even though Reddit is annoying %99 of the time and heavily influenced on the liberal side, I apologized to the mods of The Donald and they muted me (since I was already banned. I was kind of hoping I could contribute some because it&#039;s the message that&#039;s important, not necessarily the person. In any case, thanks again kind stranger(s) and I appreciate being given a crash course into the red pilled way of things. In the spirit of change, let&#039;s make this fucking planet (not just America), great again!","filename":"IMG_5035","ext":".png","w":310,"h":326,"tn_w":237,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490664481245,"time":1490664481,"md5":"4FQLSt1zI7x6yw4x7CJ4GA==","fsize":35071,"resto":0,"id":"zRfOtX94","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"ive-been-red-pilled","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

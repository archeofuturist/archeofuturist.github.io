You must be successful, reliable, hardworking, and, above all, happy. Do people in your life trust and respect you? What does your family think of you? Are you capable of raising children? Racial politics doesn\u2019t have to be the only factor of your life. And if you can&#039;t achieve these things in your real life, then you are not ready to be a political activist, either anonymously or in reality. Because if you can&#039;t make anything of your own, individual life, then how can you think you&#039;ll be able to make a real difference for the race, for the lives of many?<br><br>Always remember: we live in first world countries and have opportunity that most people born on this planet don&#039;t. Take care of yourself. Work your ass off, every day, to build a good life for you, and for your family. Spend your time wisely, and keep your real life priorities in order. Nothing on the internet should ever take away from your real life. Your time on Earth is short and precious. Start planning on making the most of it.","time":1491721571,"resto":120253165,"id":"\/g8SrtfY","country":"US","country_name":"United

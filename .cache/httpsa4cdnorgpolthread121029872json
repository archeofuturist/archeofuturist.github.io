Why did he makes such obviously bad strategic decisions contrary to what was advised by professional strategists? Did he not hold his volk to the highest regard? Furthermore why did he allow Goebbels to antagonize the jews knowing that they held great influence in the states and that many held congressional seats? Or how he threw an entire nation under a bus as he sailed away in a submarine to live his life in South America (not speculation it&#039;s within reason considering some of the evidence and the mysterious circumstances of his death)<br><br>Final question: Why do you preach open mindedness and shut your eyes when it&#039;s inconvenient? <br><br>Hitler was a card and the world got played. Holocaust didn&#039;t happen as much as it did happen because there&#039;s enough good evidence to make either argument. Do I believe people died in camps? yes. Do I believe they were being exterminated with gas like insects? No it&#039;s pure evil.","filename":"67684684683672","ext":".jpg","w":416,"h":234,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1492152233941,"time":1492152233,"md5":"oajHgLkRvV84P3NeuLvv\/A==","fsize":36977,"resto":0,"id":"XQTe6RJU","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"if-hitler-was-so-based-how-come-his-entire","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

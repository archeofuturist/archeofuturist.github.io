First, this would DRASTICALLY cut down on the number of documented rapes (good for sweden).<br>2. This would help assimilate immigrants into our culture because they are no longer sexually tensed and less prone to spontaneous sex.<br><br>What do you guys think?","filename":"Greatest-American-Hero","ext":".jpg","w":675,"h":380,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1490741894440,"time":1490741894,"md5":"JpxLq5\/Nt9AlA5sUeVAJOg==","fsize":52694,"resto":0,"id":"4Tof+UiW","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-final-solution-for-rapefugees","country_name":"Canada","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

Blue-Pilled Hippy Propaganda","com":"Conservatives use this book for arguments against MUH SOCIALISM. What they don&#039;t realize is the book was written by a Democratic Socialist aka a Socialist. The book criticizes the party for being fascist, not left-wing. INGSOC is basically if the Nazis had more control because they still use money, trading, capitalism, and as they say the proles are allowed to believe in God.<br><br>However what really ticked me off was the relationship with Julia. Winston said he was &quot;overjoyed&quot; to know that Julia slept with over 100 men and enjoyed it all. He said he loved the fact that she had sex with tons of men who were also part of the outerparty. This is clearly a pro-sexual revolution book and is liberal in essence.","filename":"orwell","ext":".jpg","w":590,"h":320,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":135,"tim":1491941085660,"time":1491941085,"md5":"ksJp\/ZYHe0xxeu9rQKvtkg==","fsize":32460,"resto":0,"id":"D+KmcFTD","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"just-read-1984-bluepilled-hippy-propaganda","country_name":"Canada","replies":162,"images":14,"unique_ips":67,"tail_size":50},{"no":120648260,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)16:08:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120647725\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120647725<\/a><br>Orson Welles was fucking afraid of a Nanny state. he hated Stalin for not intervening in the Spanish civil war.<br><br>How can anybody with a functioning mind read 1984 AND Animal Farm and not think of gommunism.<br><br>HG Wells hated commies<br><br>kys","time":1491941294,"resto":120647725,"id":"Z246traq","country":"AT","country_name":"Austria"},{"no":120648384,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)16:09:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120648260\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120648260<\/a><br>Please tell me you have cancer.

Having witnessed firsthand the horrific lengths to which totalitarian governments in Spain and Russia would go in order to sustain and increase their power, Orwell designed 1984 to sound the alarm in Western nations still unsure about how to approach the rise of communism. In 1949, the Cold War had not yet escalated, many American intellectuals supported communism, and the state of diplomacy between democratic and communist nations was highly ambiguous. In the American press, the Soviet Union was often portrayed as a great moral experiment.

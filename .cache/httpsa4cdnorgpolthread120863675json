The impeccable patriotic credentials of Kim Il Sung aren&#039;t questioned even by the meager amount of so-called defectors.<br><br>Meager, because in a nation of 25 million we have less than 30,000 &quot;defectors&quot; who crossed into imperialist territory. If even those 30,000 hardcore traitors who actually took the leap into enemy territory cannot bring themselves to criticize Kim Il Sung, then what do you think the loyalist population is like? They are militant and sincere in their deification of their leaders. Which to me is not a difficult concept to understand, I think the reason why westerners find it so &quot;bizarre&quot; or difficult to accept the genuine racial patriotism motivating the Koreans is that they conceive of DPR Korea as a Marxist-Leninist state, which, officially, it hasn&#039;t been since the 1970s, and in pratical ideological terms, it has never been Marxist-Leninist.<br><br>This superficial mischaracterization as a Marxist-Leninist state, which results from the Soviet aesthetics, brings to mind an &quot;Enlightenment ideology&quot; that is secular, materialist and obsessed with the complexities of economic theory.That&#039;s not at all what&#039;s motivating Korea, it&#039;s more a &quot;king, God and and country&quot; pre-modern sort of mentality. It&#039;s a very spiritual blood-nationalism with glorifies the Korean race, Korean history, Korean language, Korean culture and Korean soil.

The Messiah, Jesus, the son of Mary, was but a messenger of God and His word which He directed to Mary and a soul [created at a command] from Him. So believe in God and His messengers. And do not say, &quot;Three&quot;; desist - it is better for you. Indeed, God is but one God. Exalted is He above having a son. To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. And sufficient is God as Disposer of affairs.","filename":"Allah_the_One_and_Only","ext":".png","w":1280,"h":1280,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491170298467,"time":1491170298,"md5":"kSOPjZkIZ7OvvGHN6fv9Rg==","fsize":465706,"resto":119251069,"id":"sktg4AKQ","country":"FR","country_name":"France"}]}

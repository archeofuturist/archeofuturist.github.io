The synagogue has been similarly vandalized at least two other times since December.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Lt. Dennis Rosenbaum of Northeast Detectives said the boy was charged only in the most recent incident, which was captured on surveillance video Sunday night. The boy was arrested Monday, Rosenbaum said, and charged as a juvenile with institutional vandalism, criminal mischief, and possession of an instrument of crime.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;No one was injured in the incident. Rosenbaum said that it appeared the motive was simply &quot;kids being mischievous&quot; and that the boy was remorseful. The boy was with a friend at the time, but Rosenbaum said police had not yet determined whether he would also be charged.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The synagogue has been at the site since 1925 and has been described as the oldest synagogue in the Northeast.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The wave of vandalism there started before the toppling of headstones at Mount Carmel Cemetery, a Jewish burial ground in Wissinoming. Rosenbaum said police did not believe the 13-year-old was involved in that incident.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Addressing the vandals in a commentary piece last month, the rabbi of Temple Menorah Keneseth Chai, Robyn Frisch, wrote that while the repeated rock-throwing had shaken the congregation, it had also brought members closer together.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;My congregation isn&#039;t going to move out; we&#039;re going to move on,&quot; she wrote. &quot;We&#039;re here to stay, and because of your stone-throwing, we&#039;re more connected \u2014to each other and to others in our neighborhood and beyond \u2014 and we&#039;re stronger than ever.&quot;<\/span><br><br>http:\/\/www.philly.com\/philly\/news\/2<wbr>0170330_Boy_charged_as_synagogue_va<wbr>ndal.html","filename":"rockboysynagogue","ext":".png","w":891,"h":828,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":232,"tim":1490891798653,"time":1490891798,"md5":"\/bXU1sHChqqkyf89QpIeAQ==","fsize":910951,"resto":0,"id":"SaYanPSm","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"they-will-not-be-intimidated","country_name":"United States","replies":5,"images":0,"unique_ips":4},{"no":118938532,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)12:42:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"What a non-story.","time":1490892162,"resto":118937875,"id":"BW\/hDPbu","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118938715,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)12:44:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118938532\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118938532<\/a><br>NO!

The closer North Korea gets to developing ICBMs and nuclear weapons and other scary things, the more South Korea, Taiwan, and Japan, and Australia can be made to feel they need missile defense systems and military buildup. This suits the US quite well.<br><br>Guess who just accelerated their purchase of the THAAD system despite China imposing a trade blockade? South Korea! It&#039;s a fantastically expensive system, and all those dollars just poured back into the US. It&#039;s not super useful for South Korea in any conflict with North Korea (it&#039;s better to use it against long range missiles, PATRIOT batteries take care of short range stuff) but it&#039;s going to be very useful for pushing China back in the next twenty years.<br><br>After the sale and delivery of these systems, there&#039;s no longer much use in keeping North Korea around.

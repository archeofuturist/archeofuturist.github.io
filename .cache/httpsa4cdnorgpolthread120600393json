He obviously isn&#039;t focused on bombing Syrian towns and such. I personal did not like his decision to bomb the airfield but it was 1 Fucking airfield and he hasn&#039;t done shit since then. <br><br>Not to mention NK is going Fucking full autist and now that they have nukes they are threatening everyone. Its so bad even China is sick of their shit.<br><br>Why not see what Trump does rather freaking the Fuck out. <br><br>I&#039;m not saying you can&#039;t criticize him but jesuswe have no idea what he is doing with NK or Syria. <br><br>Speculation says he cut a deal with China for them to help us remove Kim and deal with NK. Also the Syria attack was a show of force to crush the MSM narrative of him and Russia collusion. <br><br>I think pol needs to calm the Fuck down and wait and see what happens before passing judgement. I will stop supporting Trump if he startz a war in Syria but he also is taking advice from his top generals like Mattis.

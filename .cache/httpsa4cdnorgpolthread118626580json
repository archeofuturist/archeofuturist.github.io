That said, the mechanics are just piled on for days. It&#039;s really a great game. It controls similar to a lot of Roguelikes except that it&#039;s a highly-detailed city-building simulation with incredibly specific details on items, anatomy, combat, physics, architecture, etc. The amount of control you have over the smallest things is really liberating and there are more than enough different options and outcomes to keep you interested.<br><br>One of my biggest problems with the game in recent years is the lack of traditional invasions and over-saturation of werebeasts.

One person believes he may eat anything, while the weak person eats only vegetables. Let not the one who eats despise the one who abstains, and let not the one who abstains pass judgment on the one who eats, for God has welcomed him. Who are you to pass judgment on the servant of another? It is before his own master that he stands or falls. And he will be upheld, for the Lord is able to make him stand. One person esteems one day as better than another, while another esteems all days alike. Each one should be fully convinced in his own mind. The one who observes the day, observes it in honor of the Lord. The one who eats, eats in honor of the Lord, since he gives thanks to God, while the one who abstains, abstains in honor of the Lord and gives thanks to God. For none of us lives to himself, and none of us dies to himself. For if we live, we live to the Lord, and if we die, we die to the Lord. So then, whether we live or whether we die, we are the Lord\u2019s. For to this end Christ died and lived again, that he might be Lord both of the dead and of the living&quot; (Romans 14:1-12 ESV).<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;what did he mean by this<\/span>","filename":"1","ext":".png","w":680,"h":510,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1492194982103,"time":1492194982,"md5":"01rbTD6YpVf7FufdWUe60g==","fsize":1540833,"resto":121072278,"id":"HMOu2d1o","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121094951,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)14:37:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121072539\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121072539<\/a><br>Well time to fap","time":1492195073,"resto":121072278,"id":"cOOSFOc3","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121094955,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)14:37:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121094667\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121094667<\/a><br>It&#039;s not an either\/or proposition. <br>In fact if the pope asks you to follow him at the expense of following Jesus, he&#039;s essentially outing himself as an imposter","time":1492195076,"resto":121072278,"id":"kDWS5M+U","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121095286,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)14:40:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"ive done all 4 of those today. oops","time":1492195259,"resto":121072278,"id":"uPdhgfbg","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121095402,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)14:41:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121094767\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121094767<\/a><br>well someone just got btfo<br>i guess it proves that majority of christcucks don&#039;t even read their own holy book","filename":"1477098305506","ext":".jpg","w":653,"h":477,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":91,"tim":1492195314038,"time":1492195314,"md5":"skhr+xdXIStBNhkZVexPTA==","fsize":195352,"resto":121072278,"id":"qx+A\/buh","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121095590,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)14:43:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121072862\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121072862<\/a><br>I&#039;m going to sacrifice you to Baal","time":1492195412,"resto":121072278,"id":"cOOSFOc3","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121095811,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)14:45:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"I certainly won&#039;t work or buy\/sell but not eating these delicious cheeseburgers in my freezer and not jerking off to hentai is gonna be a real challenge.","time":1492195527,"resto":121072278,"id":"NGPZt9y1","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121095928,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)14:46:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121072278\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121072278<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;eat meat<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;work<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;buy or sell<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;sex or masturbate<\/span><br>why the fuck not?","filename":"what the fuck is this shit2","ext":".jpg","w":613,"h":588,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":119,"tim":1492195585172,"time":1492195585,"md5":"ERdFezLKl7riDQ7ziKq5kw==","fsize":23392,"resto":121072278,"id":"fnCwmsgB","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121096106,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)14:48:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"i worked","time":1492195685,"resto":121072278,"id":"4pnKmHBv","country":"AT","country_name":"Austria"},{"no":121096217,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)14:48:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121095590\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121095590<\/a>","filename":"tfw your to edgy","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":315,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":65,"tim":1492195736232,"time":1492195736,"md5":"eLEGtFDrZLZKywo1OouLEQ==","fsize":36571,"resto":121072278,"id":"fnCwmsgB","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121096486,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)14:51:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121095811\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121095811<\/a><br>Delicious cheeseburgers.... in freezer?

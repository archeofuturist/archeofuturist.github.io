Outsiders take note, we are a pride and stubborn people, and don&#039;t conform willingly. We stick to our culture, yet recognize and respect others&#039;. We will probably not always converse in the universal language of the almighty mongolian goat herding forum (English), but we&#039;re probably willing to translate nearly anything (Dutch) for you. <br><br>---<br><br>Since we are now past the TK2017 elections, focus will shift more towards a broader--albeit still Dutch--focus. As long as these threads keep filling up (or when new Dutch happenings arise) \/polder\/ will exist and flourish.<br><br>Remember: \/polder\/ is a board of peace, brotherhood and justice.

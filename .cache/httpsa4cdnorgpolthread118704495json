The things of value I learned around that time were on the holohoax, the role of Jews, how terrible war is, the 1%, and on how shitty the republicans and democrats are. I had no comprehension of how dangerous zealotry can be or the importance of hiding your power level. Main shift from 2013-2015 was becoming more mature, less edgy, and more understanding of other viewpoints.<br>Current viewpoint: I despise white nationalists, racists, and fake NatSocs just as much as I hate SJWs<br><br>As I grew older I became more mature and stopped believing that the state should be enforcing morality, became more lenient towards social liberalism (but also better at arguing why it is bad), became more capitalist for various reasons, and spent a lot of time around libertarians so I ended up in my 2015 spot. I liked Bernie Sanders and Jim Webb around 2014, Bernie mainly for his opposition to the establishment and to lobbying, but as I researched more I learned he was controlled opposition and DemSoc will never work. Then Trump came around and I finally had hope, I adjusted my beliefs so that I could defend him strategically which pulled me to the dead center. <br>Current viewpoint: Trumpfags need to let go and stop defending his every move, conservatism is lame<br><br>After Trump was out of the way my vision became more clear and I could focus on other things, that was where I really started studying. Mostly philosophy, theology, and various fascism\/natsoc\/esotericism. The big realization there was that the government forcing people to do things is generally stupid, and instead the people should force people to do things through bullying and mob justice. An armed, intelligent, and healthy Aryan populace that is not afraid to lynch criminals and corrupt politicians is the key to healthy society.

First came here as a confident liberal (identified myself as &quot;libertarian-left&quot;). After a while on this site (I believed in the &quot;\/pol\/ is satire&quot; meme then) my left wing views began to erode with the logic and good arguments underneath the memes and shitposts and I became a moderate conservative. <br><br>Eventually, I became a populist for a while and experimented with fascism with a week (convinced it was the best system of course), but quickly I was attracted to libertarianism (at first just socially, but after research economically too). At some point I became infatuated with the free market and became more traditional-minded and right wing. The left wing, sound-good buzzwords and their unimportant non-issues began to repel me from liberalism and embrace right wing ideology.<br><br>After learning about how great privatization is and how central banking cartels like the Federal Reserve have forced billions of dollars of debt onto us, I got very far into libertarianism and at one point reached anarcho-capitalism and tried for two or three weeks straight to debunk it while believing it will work because of my lack of ability to debunk it (I got into ancapism at the same time as a friend who I was just making fun of ancaps with the day before I made him one). Eventually we found significant flaws with it and left it behind, but that was a big ideological jump.<br><br>Now I&#039;d say I&#039;m a libertarian traditionalist. I still view the State as a mafia-like entity, but I see it as an important institution for handling things like justice, healthcare, some important regulations and more. National identity, strong borders and traditional decency are important, but I&#039;m fine with multiculturalism as long as there is assimilation. I&#039;m not a follower of an ideology.

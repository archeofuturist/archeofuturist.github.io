Gang members aside, Chinese people are less likely to resort to violence than Americans are when they&#039;re crossed. Most people think of homicide as predatory or gratuitous violence, but the majority of homicide is because someone crossed someone else and they feel their honor has been slighted. One of the major disadvantages of having an honorable culture is that men feel the need to then defend that honor. This is why the South consistently has higher homicide rates than the rest of America, for every racial demographic. People in the South are far more likely to take justice into their own hands and say that if someone has wronged them that they would rather settle it themselves than involve the law. Chinese people feel no such sentiment and generally would rather be left alone than escalate a dispute. You&#039;re far more likely to get into a fistfight with an American for insulting him than you are with a Chinese guy, but be warned that in China, there&#039;s also no culture of 1v1 gentlemanly combat. If you get into a fight with a Chinese guy, expect him to call all of his brothers and male cousins who will show up on mopeds with blunt weapons.","time":1490740922,"resto":118699534,"id":"X12ox3RT","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]}

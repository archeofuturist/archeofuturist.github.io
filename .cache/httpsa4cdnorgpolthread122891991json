Islamic mindset makes you think that your cult friends are your unquestionable allies and this creates a bond between the individual worshippers.<br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=6Ds<wbr>G9yQrdD4<br><br> They form communities in foreign countries and push their agenda. The bond is stronger than a political one because every one of us here branch out on our political views when talking about specific aspects. The book of Quran is unquestionable therefore the absolute truth. This totally destroys the diversion within the cult.<br> From my observations, I have come to the conclusion today&#039;s &quot;moderate&quot; muslims are people that care half or less for their religion. The so called &quot;extremists&quot; are the true followers of the religion. They all have something to speak of. Go ask moderate muslims detailed questions, most of them cannot answer you in full knowledge. I have distant-family members who are deep in this shit and they keep preaching for it, try to convert people around them.<br> To defend yourself from the bullshit you have to hiss at them and show power. Because in their world kindness, mercy and acting civilized are the signs of weakness and stupidity and deserve to take advantage of.<br> As for the solutions for this, I have no direct answer. Let&#039;s say that west started deporting muslims. What if those groups form a massive group in their middle eastern world? Would the extreme left movement take a halt after that? Discuss your opinion on this matter.","filename":"keks_cenkdead","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":560,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":218,"tim":1493218660424,"time":1493218660,"md5":"xBWqWCKCAmSnxoKjI20Isw==","fsize":35236,"resto":0,"id":"T4qxDvCe","country":"TR","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"how-to-stop-islamic-brainwash","country_name":"Turkey","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

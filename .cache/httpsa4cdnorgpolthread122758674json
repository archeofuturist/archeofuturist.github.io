It&#039;s such a weird attraction. First off, i&#039;m no fashion guy, but it seems like if you&#039;re going to wear a fedora you have to wear nice clothes with the rest of your outfit. You&#039;re supposed to be clean shaven, nice haircut, not a graphic t-shirt, and no camo shorts. Secondly, it seems like the fedora-culture is a weird attempt for (mostly males) to grasp back at a time where masculinity was its most productive and visually appealing. They try to bring back the traditional ideals of that male but add their modern ideals while subtracting ones they feel are bad. They like the chivalry of the men but don&#039;t like the strong patriarchal nature of the man. Maybe it&#039;s a secret desire to have that patriarchal nature but they&#039;re rejecting it because it&#039;s deemed socially unacceptable in modern times? Maybe they reject it because they know they can&#039;t be that patriarchal figure?

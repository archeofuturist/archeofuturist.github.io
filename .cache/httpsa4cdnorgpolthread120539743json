Allah tells Muhammad to invoke Abraham in response to the attempts by the Jews and Christians of Arabia to convert him to their religion: \u201cAnd they say: Be Jews or Christians, then ye will be rightly guided. Say (unto them, O Muhammad): Nay, but (we follow) the religion of Abraham, the upright, and he was not of the idolaters\u201d (2:135). Allah directs Muhammad to underscore the unity of the messages of all the prophets: \u201cSay ye: \u2018We believe in Allah, and the revelation given to us, and to Abraham, Isma\u2019il, Isaac, Jacob, and the Tribes, and that given to Moses and Jesus, and that given to (all) prophets from their Lord: We make no difference between one and another of them: And we bow to Allah (in Islam)\u2019\u201d (2:136). Muhammad is directed to warn the people that those who turn away from \u201cthe religion of Abraham . . . debase their souls with folly\u201d (2:130).&quot;","time":1491881303,"resto":120539743,"id":"nrxp5y40","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120545564,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)23:28:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120544172\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120544172<\/a><br>he&#039;s including diaspora jews","time":1491881322,"resto":120539743,"id":"h3o1CW9u","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120545594,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)23:29:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120539743\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120539743<\/a><br>yeah they can fucking try to take lebanon.

The British often pay more for worse services than their continental counterparts in large part because of infrastructure\/utilities privatization. This isn&#039;t to say that all things are better public, of course not, only certain industries requiring massive public infrastructure investment. Things like the computer or game industries should be nearly or entirely private.<br><br>https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/politic<wbr>s\/2014\/aug\/22\/sale-of-century-priva<wbr>tisation-scam","time":1493482564,"resto":123345135,"id":"Sk7uBhh4","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123348458,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)12:18:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123346160\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123346160<\/a><br>Maybe you have to take things on a case by case basis and not use a blanket rule to judge all markets.","time":1493482696,"resto":123345135,"id":"Y4SOYp1q","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123348621,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)12:19:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123348222\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123348222<\/a><br>I should note, I&#039;m not the best one to talk to about this, a British poster would probably have a better idea, I&#039;ve only looked into the matter slightly and haven&#039;t lived it.

Put everything in some sort of trust. Have a family trust where only your family has asset to it. So you dont need to get a pre-nup - you will split the assets from everything you both accumulate together. Which is alot better then taking everything else from you. Lots of ways to protect your assets before you get married. <br><br>I did that with some of my assets and thank god i did because that bitch would have fucked me over. <br><br>I am now married to a strong independent right leaning woman who is very simple.

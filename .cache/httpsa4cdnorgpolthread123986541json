Based off what you&#039;ve said and what I know you&#039;ll probably get fucked in court and lost millions. Ask yourself if you&#039;re really prepared to waste over a decade and all of the effort you&#039;ve put into your business, just so you can have a very low chance of coming out of the divorce proceedings with your finances mostly intact. Divorces are expensive as fuck and even if you do get alimony from her those legal fees are going to hurt and the potential reward just isn&#039;t worth the risk and likelihood of you losing all of your shit. You should at least entertain the idea of liquidating your assets and leaving the country. I&#039;d start doing some research on extradition laws of countries that your interested in going to. Also keep in mind how protected you&#039;ll be. If you default on your 900K debt at the very least your credit will be destroyed and that 3 million that your soon to be ex wife stands to gain is certainly worth spending the money to legally pursue. So do your research, just don&#039;t talk to a fucking lawyer because planning to break the law isn&#039;t covered by confidentiality laws at least where I live. I imagine that would be pretty risky to do in Mexico as well. If you do decide to bug out, then you could easily support yourself for the rest of your life and live very comfortably without ever having to work again. Let&#039;s say that you manage to liquidate 2 million dollars of assets. If you just take that and throw it in an index fund or another low risk investment vehicle then you could reasonably expect to to make at least 5% a year on average after accounting for various fees and inflation. That&#039;s 100k a year and if you put at least a portion of that depending on how much you make back into your investments then you&#039;ll not only be","time":1493874220,"resto":123986541,"id":"jA95wtAB","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124021883,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)01:04:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124017596\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124017596<\/a><br><br>no, rich parents","time":1493874241,"resto":123986541,"id":"bDL2H1Nk","country":"MX","country_name":"Mexico"},{"no":124021913,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)01:04:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123986541\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123986541<\/a><br>at the end of this you will still be richer than me. took me two years to get out of a shitty apartment back into a house after my divorce.

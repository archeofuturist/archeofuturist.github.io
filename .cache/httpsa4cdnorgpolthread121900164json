The Cardinal Sin of Satanism. It\u2019s too bad that stupidity isn\u2019t painful. Ignorance is one thing, but our society thrives increasingly on stupidity. It depends on people going along with whatever they are told. The media promotes a cultivated stupidity as a posture that is not only acceptable but laudable. Satanists must learn to see through the tricks and cannot afford to be stupid.<br><br>Pretentiousness<br>Empty posturing can be most irritating and isn\u2019t applying the cardinal rules of Lesser Magic. On equal footing with stupidity for what keeps the money in circulation these days. Everyone\u2019s made to feel like a big shot, whether they can come up with the goods or not.<br><br>Solipsism<br>Can be very dangerous for Satanists. Projecting your reactions, responses and sensibilities onto someone who is probably far less attuned than you are. It is the mistake of expecting people to give you the same consideration, courtesy and respect that you naturally give them. They won\u2019t. Instead, Satanists must strive to apply the dictum of \u201cDo unto others as they do unto you.\u201d It\u2019s work for most of us and requires constant vigilance lest you slip into a comfortable illusion of everyone being like you. As has been said, certain utopias would be ideal in a nation of philosophers, but unfortunately (or perhaps fortunately, from a Machiavellian standpoint) we are far from that point.<br><br>Self-deceit<br>It\u2019s in the \u201cNine Satanic Statements\u201d but deserves to be repeated here. Another cardinal sin. We must not pay homage to any of the sacred cows presented to us, including the roles we are expected to play ourselves. The only time self-deceit should be entered into is when it\u2019s fun, and with awareness. But then, it\u2019s not self-deceit!","time":1492640220,"resto":121900164,"id":"uY6OuirZ","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121906207,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)18:17:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"satanism - the only thing worse than christianism","time":1492640262,"resto":121900164,"id":"HDE\/L\/pt","country":"IT","country_name":"Italy"},{"no":121906302,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)18:18:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121906128\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121906128<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121904655\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121904655<\/a><br>Nine Satanic Sins (1\/3)<br><br>Herd Conformity<br>That\u2019s obvious from a Satanic stance. It\u2019s all right to conform to a person\u2019s wishes, if it ultimately benefits you. But only fools follow along with the herd, letting an impersonal entity dictate to you. The key is to choose a master wisely instead of being enslaved by the whims of the many.<br><br>Lack of Perspective<br>Again, this one can lead to a lot of pain for a Satanist. You must never lose sight of who and what you are, and what a threat you can be, by your very existence. We are making history right now, every day. Always keep the wider historical and social picture in mind. That is an important key to both Lesser and Greater Magic. See the patterns and fit things together as you want the pieces to fall into place. Do not be swayed by herd constraints\u2014know that you are working on another level entirely from the rest of the world.<br><br>Forgetfulness of Past Orthodoxies<br>Be aware that this is one of the keys to brainwashing people into accepting something new and different, when in reality it\u2019s something that was once widely accepted but is now presented in a new package. We are expected to rave about the genius of the creator and forget the original. This makes for a disposable society.","time":1492640301,"resto":121900164,"id":"uY6OuirZ","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121906318,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)18:18:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121900164\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121900164<\/a><br>why don&#039;t you get a job?","time":1492640308,"resto":121900164,"id":"QDYgIhXx","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":121906397,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)18:19:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121904655\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121904655<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121906302\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121906302<\/a><br>Nine Satanic Sins (3\/3)<br><br>Counterproductive Pride<br>That first word is important.

When it stops working for you, when you\u2019ve painted yourself into a corner and the only way out is to say, I\u2019m sorry, I made a mistake, I wish we could compromise somehow, then do it.<br><br>Lack of Aesthetics<br>This is the physical application of the Balance Factor. Aesthetics is important in Lesser Magic and should be cultivated. It is obvious that no one can collect any money off classical standards of beauty and form most of the time so they are discouraged in a consumer society, but an eye for beauty, for balance, is an essential Satanic tool and must be applied for greatest magical effectiveness. It\u2019s not what\u2019s supposed to be pleasing\u2014it\u2019s what is. Aesthetics is a personal thing, reflective of one\u2019s own nature, but there are universally pleasing and harmonious configurations that should not be denied.","time":1492640341,"resto":121900164,"id":"uY6OuirZ","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121906654,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)18:20:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121905894\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121905894<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;furry<\/span><br><br>Still, that pretty much makes sense for the most part.

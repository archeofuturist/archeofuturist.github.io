So i was chatting with this Chinese girl on plenty of fish and i was never really informed of China&#039;s current situation with the great firewall and the internet police and i asked her if China was still killing people for the same reasons since Mao was in power. I asked her if people were still killed for their opinions etc. At that point it still showed her online but after 20 minutes she hadnt responded so i went and did something else. I came back 8 hours later and all trace of Dandanwu and any trace of our communication was nonexistent.. It didnt even show an empty user message as it does when a user deletes their own profile. That profile had to have been deleted by plenty of fish. If she was blocking me the profile would still show on goolge.. It does but it has been removed. So what happened? Did China do this? What will happen to the girl? Will there be punishment even if that person didnt respond to my message?<br><br>Maybe someone that knows can answer.. Her username is DandanWu and she has a picture of her smelling a flower if anyone wants to check.. I feel kind of guilty after reading about China&#039;s situation.<br><br>Pic not related","filename":"1490644292865","ext":".jpg","w":1100,"h":790,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":179,"tim":1490754374093,"time":1490754374,"md5":"L9ycXfOPP9fjlWmOUhzpLw==","fsize":68668,"resto":0,"id":"zx6EOn1p","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"what-happened-to-dandanwu-so-i-was-chatting-with","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":1},{"no":118735195,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)22:33:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"bump","time":1490754826,"resto":118734426,"id":"zx6EOn1p","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

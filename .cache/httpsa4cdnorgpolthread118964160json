Chinese history has always been like this. The Chinese people are an eternal slave race that has never once in their history experienced freedom of thought. Look up the Manchu conquest of Ming. The Chinese practically allowed their country to be conquered by a &quot;barbarian&quot; race that they outnumbered by 1000:1. The Chinese basically allowed their new Manchu masters to trample all over their culture and to shave their heads. The Chinese lived as slaves in their own country for 300 years. The Chinese are STILL slaves in their own country. China still has no freedom of thought!","filename":"hqdefault","ext":".jpg","w":480,"h":360,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1490905869015,"time":1490905869,"md5":"i7uHwDATX2c5++q8mzurkw==","fsize":18343,"resto":0,"id":"04UXmYL0","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"india-will-win-in-the-end","country_name":"United States","replies":9,"images":1,"unique_ips":6},{"no":118964180,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)16:31:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"That absence of freedom of thought is EXACTLY what made Chinese empires powerful in the past, and it is EXACTLY what makes China powerful right now.

The feminist illusion has always been factional, due to the nature of the &quot;&quot;&quot;philosophy&quot;&quot;&quot;. <br><br>It&#039;s a safer bet that she&#039;ll be depicted like some kind of superhuman without those specific feminist pretensions. They&#039;ll aim for a more stronk and Snyder tier approach in the action, because they want it to feel empowering and noble and shit of that nature. They want to depict what the modern woman thinks she is deep down in the most idealistic capacity, if it just weren&#039;t for those damn men reducing them (its that feminist angle). I don&#039;t watch this stuff, but I&#039;ve seen breads about superheros and it seems that Marvel has a sort of monopoly on the libshit snark angle, and depicting women like how you describe. It&#039;s all insane and stale and I look forward to this genre dying. But they aren&#039;t going to take it in that direction imo.","time":1493775741,"resto":123851765,"id":"Q0cTO7mh","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123853188,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)21:44:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123852907\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123852907<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Snyder tier<\/span><br><br>By this I meant, the implication of 100% noble intentions merely because its a protagonist.

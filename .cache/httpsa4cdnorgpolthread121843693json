UKIP is now run by an anti-white Paki shitskin and a Bible-burning Orthodox kike.

Can UKIP reinvent itself? Could they campaign to leave any other major international organisations? Are there any issues they could rally around that other parties aren&#039;t?","filename":"1442681480703-13","ext":".jpg","w":1152,"h":2048,"tn_w":140,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492608418217,"time":1492608418,"md5":"5y8jRK+onWog9nNUyCLi1g==","fsize":203243,"resto":0,"id":"DmphBeeE","country":"NL","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"british-elections-thread","country_name":"Netherlands","replies":3,"images":0,"unique_ips":4},{"no":121844740,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)09:38:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"Farage was ukip.

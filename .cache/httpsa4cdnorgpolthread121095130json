We are applying modern values of what is good and evil to God. This shows a great deal of hubris. To think that we know better than our creator what is good and what is evil. We must remember Proverbs 16:18. It is not our place to assign good and evil. <br>Not sure if I&#039;ve done a good job explaining my views here but I hope this helps.","time":1492211809,"resto":121095130,"id":"zT6Jd7l2","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121130601,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)19:18:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121095130\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121095130<\/a><br>Hey guys, just wanted to ask something<br>My parents were both raised Catholic but got me baptised anglican.

I think the most accurate and fruitful definition of me which man can frame -- at least in his present state of evolution -- is that I am the very process of enlightenment. Those who wish to think of the devil (although I wish they wouldn&#039;t!) might analogously define him as the unfortunate length of time the process takes. In this sense, the devil is necessary; the process simply does take an enormous length of time, and there is absolutely nothing I can do about it. But, I assure you, once the process is more correctly understood, the painful length of time will no longer be regarded as an essential limitation or an evil. It will be seen to be the very essence of the process itself. I know this is not completely consoling to you who are now in the finite sea of suffering, but the amazing thing is that once you grasp this fundamental attitude, your very finite suffering will begin to diminish -- ultimately to the vanishing point.<\/span>","filename":"sock","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":700,"tn_w":107,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492212069866,"time":1492212069,"md5":"8J5Mv9IXvwEk6H\/AfLf\/gw==","fsize":238130,"resto":121095130,"id":"qCI+tc0D","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121131317,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)19:23:43","name":"WOLFSHIEM","com":"<a href=\"#p121130421\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121130421<\/a><br>That is a hard topic, particularly with how varied suffering can be. Allow me to speak in detail about it though:<br><br>Classically, Christianity rejects the notion of &quot;evil&quot; having existence. In this view good is defined as the fulfillment of the natural goals of things in nature (for example a heart is for pumping blood and so the pumping of blood is the good of the heart, etc). This is the mainstream view of the good until the modern era but its still upheld by the church. Evil, then, would not be a kind of material or substance but rather a lacking of the good or something that works against the good of things.<br><br>Now to the problem of evil, there are two major Catholic views on it:<br><br>1. Necessary evils. By the nature of reality some evils must be allowed to occur to enable good. A basic example of this would be the possibility of sin to allow free will to occur and love as we are made to do. Further, the very limited nature of reality adds to this as well.<br><br>2. Redemptive suffering. God draws all things to his will. What suffering we cannot escape are not given to us as tests but as opportunities for growth in virtue (God&#039;s will for us). They may propel us to act virtuous more, they may be unbearable and break our hearts so they may be opened up, they may be punishment, they may be even a way to strengthen us. The guiding tool to see this suffering and overcome it is precisely what the church promotes so much in the Christian life: Faith. To have faith in these situations is what it means to &quot;live by faith&quot;.<br><br>An explanation of Catholic&#039;s understanding of prayer is next:","filename":"Jesus laying down the law","ext":".jpg","w":532,"h":559,"tn_w":118,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492212223051,"time":1492212223,"md5":"+YnorGj0li0WHXtf+BPpwg==","fsize":46079,"resto":121095130,"id":"EraKi\/+q","country":"US","trip":"!!tuOwy1ct2dy","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121131367,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)19:24:08","name":"WOLFSHIEM","com":"<a href=\"#p121131317\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121131317<\/a><br>To elaborate on the nature of prayer as well:<br><br>There are absolutely tons of forms of Christian prayer, to the point it is best defined as an application of the mind and heart towards union with God, whether this be petition, song, meditation, thanksgiving, contemplation, intercession (prayer on behalf of another), asking someone in Heaven to pray for you, or done with any formality or length. The desire for God in the prayer does not need be explicit either. The point of it is greater communion with God and through that we come to meet the mark to receive what God had planned for us or others. Prayer is largely a &quot;meeting the mark&quot; process and method for individual growth.<br><br>Through petition we give respect to God to give and through it our relationship is grown.

My thoughts are that the evil that controls aspects of our government are going to be selfish as fuck. Selfish, greedy, and out for themselves - as we know. I think that they would also want to avoid any catastrophic global disaster\/conflict (nuke etc) in order to continue their endeavors into physical pleasures. Just as we want to simply live happily without devolving into world conflict, so to would they, but their reason for wanting to persist on Earth is to fuck children. Or whatever the flavor of evil may be. <br><br>Regardless of how much technology progresses, we seem to adapt well to it. There will always be a place to carve out our own section of the world. There will always be that guy that decides to program his own messenger app with encryption because the Snowden revelations freaked him out. There will always be someone who makes videos about these corrupt gapefags and end up becoming popular, exposing the truth to millions. <br><br>Evil seeks itself out of necessity. They are the minority, and their survival is based off of secretive maneuvers among a somewhat small group of people. <br><br>Good does not by default seek itself out, which leaves us at a disadvantage in the first few turns of the game. We are unsuspecting, idealistic, optimistic. But when we finally understand the breadth of the evil that has its hands in our lives, the good is just as efficient at seeking eachother out as Evil, except that here&#039;s the thing: Good doesn&#039;t seek itself out out of necessity like Evil does.

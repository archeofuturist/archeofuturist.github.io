Corporate profits are aligned with stock market valuations, the 2000 tech bubble was a REAL bubble, and to a lesser extent 2008, but right now there is NO bubble in the stock market, in fact one might even say it&#039;s undervalued. If Trump succeeds with his corporate tax cuts the market will have MUCH more room to grow, and if not it will grow anyways as international capital parks in the US stock market seeking safety from the stagnant Japanese and European economies, volatile emerging markets, and the paper tiger known as China.","filename":"1475626175779","ext":".png","w":631,"h":382,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":151,"tim":1493176320983,"time":1493176320,"md5":"PNCII8qe1Gw2wp6pbu59AA==","fsize":15911,"resto":0,"id":"gEXZisAQ","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"dude-fucking-stock-market-bubble-economic","country_name":"Canada","replies":6,"images":1,"unique_ips":7},{"no":122834611,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)23:16:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"Mate, it&#039;s not about whether the tax cuts will boost profits to further boost the market it&#039;s that the current market is extremely overvalued compared to the undelrying economic situation, only inflated by cheap credit that we were supposed to deleverage from over the last 8 or 9 years of &quot;recovery&quot;. <br><br>Nothing Trump can tweak will stop the house of cards with it&#039;s rotten base from tumbling down.","time":1493176569,"resto":122834164,"id":"I0kWyfy0","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":122835013,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)23:19:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122834164\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122834164<\/a><br>Mr Sholomo look at the advertising bubble, the housing bubble and the existence of privately owned federal reserves economic collapse don&#039;t happen they are engineered","time":1493176773,"resto":122834164,"id":"tBDsYOpq","country":"IN","country_name":"India"},{"no":122835353,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)23:22:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122834164\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122834164<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;muh graph <\/span><br>why can&#039;t they afford to fix the bridges and roads?","filename":"Oetzi_01","ext":".jpg","w":512,"h":341,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1493176944540,"time":1493176944,"md5":"c4W57SMupXlGx6dsp\/GGDA==","fsize":37175,"resto":122834164,"id":"ZbDImRwJ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122836315,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)23:31:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122834164\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122834164<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;please invest more money goyim<\/span><br><br>So when you guys think this bad boy is gonna pop?

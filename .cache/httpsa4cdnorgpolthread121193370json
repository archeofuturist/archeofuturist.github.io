Because of the Prussian failure to defeat Napoleon, Germany took a long hard look at its institutions\u2014primarily its school system. This introspection led to the conclusion that Prussian pride and power could only be restored by restructuring that system.<br><br>A strategy was devised in which the Prussian government would set up a forced government educational system which would turn out well disciplined students who would follow orders without questioning authority. To accomplish this feat, the goal of educating children became a national priority permeated with strategies adapted to turn out a national work force rather then an educated citizenry. Every step in the education process was calculated to offer authority figures the least amount of trouble and consequently train a well disciplined albeit docile citizen.<br><br>Of course the government\u2019s attitude towards ordinary citizens did not carry over to the aristocratic upper classes, about 200 families, that owned most of the property and controlled the purse strings in Prussia\u2014and who were intent on keeping it that way. These families did not want their children attending school with the lower classes and in the course of things the new educational protocol gave the upper classes choice in deciding the kind of schools their children would attend, a choice it did not offer to the average German.<br><br>Mandatory kindergarten was necessary because it served to break the influence of the mother over the child thus making the child more responsive to government influence.","time":1492260376,"resto":121193370,"id":"xkKb4XG4","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121206747,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)08:46:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121206694\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121206694<\/a><br>Another development added to the growing furor and revolution in American education. In the early 1800\u2019s, what is commonly known as the Ph.D. did not exist in the United States. Then a well connected American named Edward Everett went to Germany to take courses and returned to this country as the first American to receive a Ph.D. degree. Eventually, 10,000 of America\u2019s wealthiest families would send their sons to obtain the Ph.D. in Prussian universities. Ultimately, this development would affect the educational and intellectual make up of the entire education system from kindergarten through college. These German trained Ph.D.\u2019s took over the educational establishment in the United States and anchored themselves in positions of political and economic power and influence. The substance of the course work in Prussian universities in tandem with the educational philosophy tended to be socialist and collectivist in nature. Consequently, the knowledge and mind set of the Prussian system were passed on to several generations of American intellectuals.<br><br>Implementation of the Prussian System Implementation of the Prussian system was to become the goal of Edward Everett, America\u2019s first Ph.D. As Governor of Massachusetts, Everett had to deal with the problem of the influx of poor Irish Catholics into his state. In 1852, with the support of Horace Mann, another strong advocate of the Prussian model, Everett made the decision to adopt the Prussian system of education in Massachusetts. Unfortunately for the children and poor Irish Catholics of Massachusetts and elsewhere, the system produced a willing, cheap labor force with minimal reading and numbers skills. The Everetts of the world understood that people who could read and understand are dangerous because they are intellectually equipped to find out things for themselves, thus becoming a threat to already established power elites.","time":1492260411,"resto":121193370,"id":"xkKb4XG4","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121206774,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)08:47:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121203749\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121203749<\/a><br>what a fucking legend","time":1492260438,"resto":121193370,"id":"iONlwyrk","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":121206775,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)08:47:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121206747\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121206747<\/a><br>Shortly after Everett and Mann collaborated to adopt the Prussian system, the Governor of New York set up the same method in 12 different New York schools on a trial basis.

In a &quot;blitzkreig&quot; action with no debate, public hearing, or citizen involvement, government forced schooling was on its way in America.<br><br>The Results of the Prussian System<br><br>The history of American education since the acceptance of the Prussian system is checkered with failure and elitism.

We can track the five different stages that American education has gone through: 1750-1852\u2014The idea of government controlled schools was conceived; 1852-1900\u2014It was politically debated in state legislatures; 1900-1920\u2014We had government controlled industrialized factory modeled schooling; 1920-1960\u2014Schools changed from being academically focused to becoming socialized; and 1960 to the Present\u2014Schools became psychological experimental labs.","time":1492260437,"resto":121193370,"id":"xkKb4XG4","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121206809,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)08:47:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121206775\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121206775<\/a><br>In the year 1941 the Defense Department was preparing for World War II.

Their ability to do so is why when the right isn&#039;t in power we can stop them (again, a feature, not a bug). The travel ban will eventually make it to the supreme court and the lower court ruling will be shot down. Sadly the sanctuary city funding will probably be upheld because stipulations on funds cannot be added after the fact. The only reason you&#039;re seeing them flip you off is because they control nearly all the media so every time Trump stubs his toe you get 20 articles and 6 hours of cable news talking about Trump&#039;s latest failure to coordinate his foot placement.<br><br>Think of it like a game of baseball. Republicans are at bat right now (on the offense). The Democrats can strike them out or get them out on base, but they can&#039;t actually score any points until they&#039;re at bat again (2 years at a minimum, realistically 6-8 years).

I despise when the news media plays up the event and neglects to share the faces and names of the scum involved in shit like this. I also note that it seems that if a white person is involved in a similar incident, their name and face, dead or not, minor or not, is immediately everywhere. I can find the fat coalburner&#039;s name and face, but no pictures or names for her dead accomplices. My take? Niggers. &quot;Oh, don&#039;t upset the black folks! Investigate the homeowner&#039;s son and don&#039;t name the home invaders, because you know they dindu nuffin!&quot;<br><br>Show me the niggers, please. I want to write a nice letter of congratulations to their nigger failparents. Stop talking about the AR-15, the castle doctrine and self defense in the same breath you mention &#039;police investigation&#039;. Tell us who they were and put their damn pictures up. Fucking cops, in Oklahoma no goddamn less, act as if there&#039;s something to know other than they were armed, wearing masks, gloves and black clothing, and got shot in someone else&#039;s house, but they have to investigate the incident like the person shooting may have somehow been at fault. No. Fuck off. Link related, full story.

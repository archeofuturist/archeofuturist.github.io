It&#039;s a bunch of hacking scripts. Some designed to work together. Some are examples\/templates to be modified with some explanations. Lots of stuff for specific exploits. Some generic helpers and stuff for post-exploitation management. A lot of it seems old though. It&#039;s all to be used by hand and probably needs a lot of fiddling. Must be very hard to use for anyone other than those who wrote them. The NSA must have kits that are much easier to use and more automated by now.","time":1491714687,"resto":120237596,"id":"t97Q0oCw","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]}

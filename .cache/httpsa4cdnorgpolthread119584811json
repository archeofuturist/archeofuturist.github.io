Australians themselves are just annoying and obnoxious people. This is compounded by their annoying accent and the annoying way in which they speak. It is further compounded by the fact that they think that Australia is greatest country on Earth and will relentlessly create opportunities to tell you so. This is especially irritating because after spending about one day in Australia you will know that this is not true at all. Australians think that even the most innocuous of conversations is an argument and will stop at nothing to &quot;win&quot;. Australians do not speak with people, they speak AT people. They will simply stare at you with a stupid look on their face while they wait for their turn to speak if they haven&#039;t already interrupted you. Imagine speaking to someone and literally every single thing that comes out of their mouth is an IRL shitpost. <br><br>7. Australian women are sluts. Not in a good way, in a disgusting way. They are a trashy mix between chavy British sluts with fake bolted on tits and way too much makeup and ditsy California valley girl bimbos. Invariably, they have had at least one STD in their lifetime and suck an average of probably about 12 different dicks a week.<br><br>8. It smells like stale french fries. I do not the reason for this. Some mornings when you go outside there is just this disgusting, pervasive smell of stale french fries in the air.<br><br>9. They are all terrible drivers and\/or think they are drift racers.<br><br>10. The cops are faggots. They will manufacture reasons for why they pulled you over or stopped you on the sidewalk and will give out sky high fines for basically anything.They all act like they have something to prove. They will ask you a bunch of irrelevant questions and when you attempt to answer these questions they will puff out their chests and threaten to arrest you for &quot;antagonizing the public&quot;. They are like those people who get in your face and continuously say &quot;HMM? HMM? HMM?&quot; after they have asked you a question.","time":1491384270,"resto":119584811,"id":"uL0+oPj4","country":"NZ","country_name":"New Zealand"},{"no":119588417,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)05:25:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"11.

You&#039;re in the complete wrong there with that statement. Your body needs more nutrients in the morning (or rather when you wake up) than anytime in the day. Stats show that most healthy individuals from different countries eat a larger breakfast, medium lunch, and small dinner. <br><br>If anything for the US, it would be the change of what a normal breakfast is today. A large percentage have started to eat cereals for breakfast, because it is the &quot;fast n easy&quot; thing to do before starting the day. This means you are giving your body a fuck ton of sugar each morning. A bowl today of cereal can range upwards to 10-18g+ of sugar, and a cup of milk at 2% is ~12g. Being american you know that size is doubled, if not tripled for a &quot;meal&quot;, meaning avg american on a cereal breakfast is getting 42g+ of sugar. <br><br>AHA says it&#039;s capping out a healthy diet for men at 37.5g per day, and 25g for women.

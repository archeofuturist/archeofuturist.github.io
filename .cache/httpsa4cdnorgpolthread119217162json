There are about a million Iranians and Iranian-descendants here in USA, many (most) in California. So I can&#039;t speak for everyone else and I have no connection or allegiance to Iran as a nation state (especially since my family and many other good people suffered tremendously after the 1979 islamic revolution). Anyway, I totally support your Kurdish state idea, although I worry that Turkey and Iran will go full retard. Isn&#039;t there lots of oil wealth on that Kurdish land?<br><br>Also can you explain something about your understanding of Israel and Zionism&#039;s relationship with the Kurdish people and the historical non-existence of Kurdistan. I remember a quote from an early founder of Israel and it said something along the lines of &quot;we can never allow the Kurdish people to get their own state.&quot; Considering how Israel tries to run the show in that whole area... perhaps things have changed in the past 70 years or so?<br><br>Obviously I know that it was the Sykes-Picot Agreement between England and France that gave the modern nation state borders for this reason, and they were designed to cut thru large ethnic groups. So one could say Sykes and Picot and everything they represented was behind undermining the Kurds too, but I think Sykes-Picot was probably fairly Jewish controlled. You see a lot of talk about Israel before the holocaust and stuff, so they&#039;ve been working on this for at least a 100 years.<br><br>Why does the Jew fear the Kurd?","time":1491151992,"resto":119217162,"id":"2vzgLkfw","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119218128,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)12:54:23","name":"Sage","com":"<a href=\"#p119217668\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119217668<\/a><br>so do you, selahtin","time":1491152063,"resto":119217162,"id":"1WlZZAeJ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119218266,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)12:55:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119218015\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119218015<\/a><br>hmmm from my understanding, the current political climate in America and Israel actually support a Kurdish state, as it directly opposes Israel&#039;s enemies. <br><br>I&#039;ve been to Israel many times for work.

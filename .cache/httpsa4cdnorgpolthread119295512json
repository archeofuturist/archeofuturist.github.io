Moderates thought the gender BLM shit was retarded but were shunned for it. MSM pushes it too. They had to turn to the Internet to find alternative view points (which were mainstream just a few years ago), this leads to them being redpilled. Plus the economy continued to stagnate for most and Obama didn&#039;t push any big &quot;change&quot; besides the Obamacare debacle. People become disillusioned with the left\/democrats in general and vote for an alternative. People start caring less and less about the left&#039;s go-to insults. This happened to enough people (mostly White Americans who see the writing on the wall) to the point where these views are becoming mainstream again.","time":1491199957,"resto":119295512,"id":"y4IFPV+b","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

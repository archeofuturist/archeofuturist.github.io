The fact of the matter is that consciousness is essentially the result of neuronal connection and computation. A substance is called &quot;addictive&quot; if it has structural, chemical properties that can affect dopaminergic neurons in the brain that are wired to control centers in your brain. With time under the presence of these substances, the neurons will prune certain synapses and reform others within the frontal cortex. The frontal cortex controls judgement - weighs outcome of decisions. The &quot;Addiction of Disease&quot; model only recognizes that the brain is in a state that it was not encoded to develop into due the intake of a substance. It then looks at methods to reverse that state. It is widely accepted that the brain itself is capable of using consciousness to alter neuronal connections and is why first line treatment is always psychological other than to treat withdrawal symptoms.","time":1491146197,"resto":119201030,"id":"cQiVihAQ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119209076,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)11:17:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119201030\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119201030<\/a><br>Pick up a hobby or something you generally enjoy, anything that will distract you (but not from work\/school).

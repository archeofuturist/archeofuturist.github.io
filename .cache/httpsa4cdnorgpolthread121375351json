Somehow we decided 30 years was a good period for study. And it would just so happen that the most current technology we use for this was put into operation some 30 years ago. Using that data, we could note that it is true, global temperatures *have* risen by some .3 degrees in the last 30 years, *on average*.<br><br>The fatal flaw in this method stems from how recently it was introduced. When one looks at the data recorded with our previous most accurate temperature measurement devices (weather balloons), you can notice that in the last 30 years there is a very strong correlation with the weather balloon data and the satellite data we use now. With the knowledge that weather balloons haven&#039;t improved in accuracy to a noticeable degree since its inception, it is safe to say that the modern satellite data would match the data gathered with weather balloons quite similarly.<br><br>Now, with this in mind, looking at past climate data recorded with weather balloons, you&#039;ll notice that from somewhere around the late 50s? the climate has remained somewhat stagnant, apart from this recent incline in temperature over the last 30 years. However, pre-50s you&#039;ll notice that the global temperature was far, far higher than it is today by a degree or some such amount-<br><br>cont.","time":1492360477,"resto":121375351,"id":"Nb33ktfX","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":121380029,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)12:50:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121377895\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121377895<\/a><br>than it ever was before the industrial revolution.

Hypothosis: These are the first items to be &#039;lost&#039; by the events of climate change as they are in the hot zones. Notes: Most people who came looking were not too disturbed. One individual thought he saw fish sauce at the back shelf but it was actually soy sauce I had placed there - I believe this demonstrates the &#039;folly&#039; of seeing technological fixes as a way to prevent the issues with climate change. Overall, I was not too concerned on day 1 and even had hope<br><br>Day 2: Plastered fake &#039;possibly radioactive&#039; stickers on produce from Indian subcontinent and removed some items from Bangladesh Hypothosis: India and Pakistan will have a nuclear skirmish due to climate change therefore irradiating food Notes: Many people seemed confused and did not purchase the products. Had to cut experiment short because a man spoke to a staff member then pointed at me. Overall I believe that this proves people cannot understand the way climate change harms the food supply.<br><br>Day 3: Entered supermarket late at night and poured ants into the carrots. Hypothosis: This represents pests becoming widespread due to the warming climate in the north Notes: Nobody took the carrots and seemed disgusted. Clearly proves people will not eat pested crops and may resort to cannibalistic behaviour within 3 days of the collapse.<br><br>This is a small experiment but I think is telling.","time":1492361477,"resto":121375351,"id":"vNti9Pt2","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121380453,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)12:53:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"The late and the great Bob Cater gives a great explanation about this if you&#039;re interested- and he&#039;s aussie too<br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=DRC<wbr>ISn1KfKQ","time":1492361609,"resto":121375351,"id":"Nb33ktfX","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":121380997,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)12:57:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;MUH CLIMATE<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;MUH ENERGY<\/span><br>None of it will matter when the sun gets bigger and engulfs our solar system.

I need you to stare hard at the image.<br>It is YOU and YOU are the last remaining Reds. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Our history tells of the Great Wood where we the Albion Reds thrived. Generation after generation built their drays here, and all was well. Our Grandfathers speak of such times as the Days of Wonder.These were the days before the Great War. <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The first Gray appeared at Springtime, and was welcomed with idle curiosity. <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;By late Springtime their number was twelve, and they had isolated themselves in Copse Hill. Their numbers grew. <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;By Midsummer they had taken the Oaks of Bracken Pass. <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;When next year&#039;s frost had cleared, one thousand bucks entered the Great Wood and every tree South of the Great Ferns had been taken by a Grey. The killings began about a week later. <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The first body we found was a Red Patroller named Thicklebrush. His scratched and bitten body was hidden under damp beech leaves. Several days later two more bodies, a buck and a doe, were found, but this time there was no effort made to conceal the bodies. By the dawn of the next morning six more bodies were discovered, three of which were headless. <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;As their numbers surged the Greys, growing in confidence, spilled out from Bracken Pass and took over every tree. Reds either fled or were killed. <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;By Octoberon the Great Wood had fallen completely to the Grey. The advantage of time was always with the Grey. The advantage of number was always with the Grey&#039;s litter. <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;They killed us, outbred us, and took both acorn and drey. Those that survived left the woods for solitary oaks in country estates. There they found comfort, but it was short lived. <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Greys swarmed from the Great Wood in all directions: barely a Red survived. <\/span><br>And yet here today we stand<br>My beloved Albion. <br>What few remain are gathered. We are Red and we are magnificent. We are outnumbered, but I say to you be ready and be strong. Today is the day we take our Great Wood back.

JAY WAS BORN IN 1988 IN VIRGINIA, WHICH IS SIGNIFICANT AS IT WAS THE SAME YEAR BUSH SENIOR WON THE AMERICAN PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. BUT VIRGINIA HAS ALWAYS CONSIDERED ITSELF AS POSSESSING A CERTAIN BON TON OF SORTS. A DYSPHORIC STATE, TORN BETWEEN THE NORTH AND THE SOUTH IN THAT CIVIL WAR, TORN BETWEEN THE OLD WORLD AND THE NEW. A RECRUDESCENCE OF ENLIGHTENMENT TRIUMPHALISM BUT ALWAYS AN ARISTOCRATIC GLEAM IN THE EYE.....

THE BARBARIC HAS BECOME HYPOSTATIZED IN MODERNITY TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT IS HAS BECOME ITS OWN NEGATION. MY VIEW IS THAT BARBARISM DOES NOT STAND APART FROM CIVILISATION, BUT THAT IT IS A NECESSARY ASPECT OF IT.

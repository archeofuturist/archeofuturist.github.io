Be prepared to defend yourselves and others IF FORCED, bring defensive implements IF YOU MUST, but do NOT under ANY circumstances bring weapons.<br>3) Do NOT come dressed like Neo-Nazi stomcunts or tacticool fags. Bring safety\/sporting gear if you have it, but don&#039;t look like you came dressed for a riot.<br>4) Do NOT act like a sperg and call random people niggers or kikes, it&#039;s terrible for our image and may get you suspended if you go to school here.<br>5) Do NOT cause damage to the campus or the downtown area.<br><br>1) DO wear Auburn colors to the rally - dark blue and orange<br>2) DO act civil and composed - there must be a stark contrast between you and the Antifa hooligans<br>3) DO take lots of pics and vids so you can report any Antifa to police\/university.<br>4) DO talk to press about the importance of defending speech, ESPECIALLY unpopular speech, on college campuses.<br>5) DO stay after the rally to help clean up damage caused by Antifa. Bring trashbags for litter, medkits to help with bystander injuries.<br><br>And most importantly, if you are a student or faculty member at Auburn, please stay safe tomorrow.<br><br>War Eagle!","filename":"1492480782159","ext":".gif","w":200,"h":178,"tn_w":200,"tn_h":178,"tim":1492492730032,"time":1492492730,"md5":"DYlk8nDGzegJp15S4JYYNQ==","fsize":11530,"resto":0,"id":"C4wPcPFM","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"richard-spencer-in-auburn-general-defend-your","country_name":"United States","replies":10,"images":5,"unique_ips":7},{"no":121643351,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)01:20:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"Soundtrack for this thread: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=gSJ<wbr>x7STd6j4","filename":"Hogwarts_suits_of_armour_and_statues","ext":".jpg","w":1920,"h":816,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":53,"tim":1492492847345,"time":1492492847,"md5":"\/gy0MwnAJkcOIk78WhZ7WQ==","fsize":223569,"resto":121643156,"id":"C4wPcPFM","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":121643574,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)01:22:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"For those who can&#039;t make it, Auburn has 24\/7 live webcams of campus here: http:\/\/www.auburn.edu\/webcams\/<br><br>Get some popcorn!","time":1492492978,"resto":121643156,"id":"C4wPcPFM","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121643605,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)01:23:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"I was actually really excited to just go see Spencer&#039;s speech, but now we&#039;re about to go to war.<br><br>How did it all come to this?","filename":"1492367783633","ext":".jpg","w":648,"h":562,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":108,"tim":1492492997544,"time":1492492997,"md5":"Q\/6mkXBniQAVjFtzSt1lEQ==","fsize":56549,"resto":121643156,"id":"JHAOTxsG","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121643639,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)01:23:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"The south will rise again (and stomp on commie necks)","filename":"1476674429181","ext":".jpg","w":1920,"h":1080,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1492493020337,"time":1492493020,"md5":"RCksJetwH7BIG5OcBXNOcw==","fsize":175326,"resto":121643156,"id":"30V6ZvV4","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":121643722,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)01:24:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"This is gonna be... a riot","time":1492493066,"resto":121643156,"id":"rJFIHQT8","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121643787,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)01:25:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"Richard Spencer&#039;s video where he discusses what happened at Auburn: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=9vu<wbr>heZSOqlY","filename":"Bo6zeT61","ext":".jpg","w":400,"h":400,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492493106761,"time":1492493106,"md5":"sfKhMjlOtWJK001ZGhYQBQ==","fsize":24875,"resto":121643156,"id":"C4wPcPFM","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121643892,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)01:26:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121643156\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121643156<\/a>","filename":"l-352684","ext":".jpg","w":605,"h":358,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":73,"tim":1492493169833,"time":1492493169,"md5":"k9oRsGG9gqlA1vQsCnvfzw==","fsize":35124,"resto":121643156,"id":"pKTL2gb6","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":121643967,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)01:26:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"i have this weird feeling that somebody is going to get shot desu :^)","time":1492493208,"resto":121643156,"id":"LVdO0sSc","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121644164,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)01:28:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"Reminder, cops are going to target this even hard.

A third of Sioux Falls students are students of color, and it&#039;s well-established from decades of research that students benefit from having teachers of the same race or ethnicity, who can serve as mentors, advocates and role models.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;But it&#039;s not just students of color who benefit from having diverse teachers.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;An August 2015 essay in The Atlantic outlined the case for why white students need more teachers of color.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;Anecdotal and empirical evidence suggests that teachers of color can help disrupt what are often one-sided portrayals of the world and offer invaluable insight to students from different backgrounds,&quot; Melinda Anderson wrote.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Culturally diverse teachers give students access to broader perspectives on the world. A 2014 study concluded white teenagers receive &quot;contradictory and incomplete&quot; messages on race from their parents, and that schools play an important role in bridging those gaps.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;And students of all races appreciate having diversity at the front of their classroom. An October 2016 study published in Education Researcher shows that students view teachers of color favorably (and, in some cases, more favorably than white teachers).<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Sioux Falls schools are looking to increase diversity by encouraging high school students of color to consider a career in teaching, though the Grow Your Own program is not limited to students of color. The goal is to be inclusive, Superintendent Brian Maher said.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;Our big goal is to evolve as a school district demographically as our community evolves,&quot; he said.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;And that&#039;s not just for the benefit of students of color. It&#039;s for all students.<\/span>","filename":"Sioux Falls schools are aggressively seeking teachers of color.

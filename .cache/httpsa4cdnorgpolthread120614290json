Most economy is agriculture, with light production in most parts (brewing, clothes-making, construction, etc).<br><br>Maybe, then, we can locate heavy industry (weapons, vehicles, etc.) in large cities, which exist as (ideally) non-culturally distinct commercial zones with no political power. As in everyone commutes there except for a select few officers and managers who can maintain distance from the urban lifestyle that has destroyed the West.<br><br>The basic building block of this society will of course be the empowered individual man who owns land, and above him, his family. Women and men will work together when the women do not have children to raise and teach.<br><br>Any central government should also exist outside of a city. I&#039;m thinking of Kamakura, the home of Japan&#039;s first shogunate. It was a rural area, and home to Japan&#039;s strongest, who ran the country. The opposite of D.C. and New York, where our country&#039;s weakest and most compromised live and manipulate the rest of the nation.<br><br>Anyway, I&#039;m rambling. Where do cities fit into your ideal society? Can we have redpilled cities of 1 million plus?<br><br>Also, post more pics of maidens in fields.","filename":"wheatgirlhorse","ext":".jpg","w":800,"h":556,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":173,"tim":1491926467811,"time":1491926467,"md5":"Rh2QEumRpW5mg9+AlOhHQw==","fsize":213069,"resto":0,"id":"QmCmx7bp","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"a-place-for-cities","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":1,"unique_ips":2},{"no":120615461,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)12:11:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"Cities are polluted sinkholes of degeneracy.

Nothing came out of them that was damning enough to put anyone in prison. Nothing came out of them that was damning enough to get anyone fired. Nothing came out of them that didn&#039;t require major hyping or total memes like pizzagate. They can&#039;t even charge her with a crime for the private server part. So basically, nothing. <br><br>If Russia hadn&#039;t hacked American servers, then this would have never been a scandal. And without the server scandal looming over her head, and the waves of shitposts from the paid Russian shill botnet which was documented by the government, then she would have won. Period. Point blank. <br><br>I mean, without a scandal, you don&#039;t honestly think that Hillary Clinton could have lost to a man who was stupid enough to talk about a muslim ban or say &quot;grab her by the pussy&quot; in a place where there are microphones present.<br><br>So every time you try to say Russia didn&#039;t influence the election, you&#039;re just wrong. Point blank. Obviously they did. Obviously Trump is president because of them. He couldn&#039;t have won on his own. Literally impossible. <br><br>Conservatives are retarded but not THAT retarded.","filename":"1490839104608","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":640,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490886376425,"time":1490886376,"md5":"p3D7oA22NjWkCH\/ylgM+FA==","fsize":62705,"resto":0,"id":"fuO2vqOF","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"so-we-all-agree-that-hillarys-emails-were-a-huge","country_name":"United States","replies":17,"images":5,"unique_ips":10},{"no":118928949,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)11:07:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118928873\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118928873<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;1 post by this ID<\/span>","time":1490886429,"resto":118928873,"id":"ro5bJN1P","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118929013,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)11:07:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118928949\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118928949<\/a><br>This bot seems to be broken","time":1490886466,"resto":118928873,"id":"fuO2vqOF","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118929125,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)11:09:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118929013\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118929013<\/a><br>Not an argument","time":1490886545,"resto":118928873,"id":"ro5bJN1P","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118929232,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)11:10:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118929125\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118929125<\/a><br>And you didn&#039;t provide one.<br><br>Someone ban this broken bot please.","time":1490886612,"resto":118928873,"id":"fuO2vqOF","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118929387,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)11:11:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118929232\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118929232<\/a><br>Not an argument","time":1490886698,"resto":118928873,"id":"ro5bJN1P","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118929621,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)11:13:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118929387\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118929387<\/a>","filename":"shillbots","ext":".png","w":954,"h":1770,"tn_w":67,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490886822957,"time":1490886822,"md5":"FHHmABDIupi40xy9FccRPg==","fsize":181039,"resto":118928873,"id":"fuO2vqOF","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118929839,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)11:15:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118928873\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118928873<\/a><br><br>conservatives really are that retarded, they still pretend to believe tax cuts create jobs<br><br>by &#039;hacking the election&#039; they dont realize hacking the news cycle is the same thing as hacking the election, Putin knows you dont have to actually hack votes, just the voters<br><br>its the cheapest form of warfare there is.","filename":"trump palmer report","ext":".jpg","w":975,"h":900,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":115,"tim":1490886950512,"time":1490886950,"md5":"y8JBRU3sk1FJ\/XvMxP0xCQ==","fsize":224761,"resto":118928873,"id":"4wQK9H7s","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118929902,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)11:16:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118928873\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118928873<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Nothing came out of them that was damning enough to put anyone in prison.<\/span><br><br>She lost the election tho so there&#039;s that :)","time":1490886985,"resto":118928873,"id":"hyYYI7UW","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118929918,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)11:16:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118929621\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118929621<\/a><br>This is sad you&#039;re not even good at this.

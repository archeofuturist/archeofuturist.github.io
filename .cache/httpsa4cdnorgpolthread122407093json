I have no idea what the numbers mean but I do know that a code black is very, very bad. There&#039;s a range of color codes used, with white being everything going well and black being a shit hitting the fan type of thing. I know this because my office was right across from the office of another guy who I didn&#039;t know very well, but I won&#039;t give out names. He handled some kind of planning, coordination, or something along those lines. He left his door open a lot and I overheard the color codes being used. Black was used when discussing things like terrorist attacks or movement of large amounts of weapons or extremely dangerous materials. Because I was working with very sensitive information I had to apply for confidential security clearance. <br><br><a href=\"#p122414509\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122414509<\/a><br><a href=\"#p122415987\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122415987<\/a><br><a href=\"#p122416430\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122416430<\/a><br>Nuclear weapons do exist.

I live near a 711 and theres always fat people, nogs and spics using their EBT cards to buy overpriced snacks and pop. 10 percent of of snap benefits was spent on sweet drinks in 2011 (pop, sweet tea, energy drinks etc). The same people who think this is ok also think we need to make healthcare free. Billions of dollars spent on sugar drinks every year isnt making them healthy, and thats not even mentioning the amount money spent on salty snacks, frozen foods and prepared desserts. Only 40 percent of Snap food benefits gets spent on necessary nutritional food (meat, milk, eggs, bread, fruit, vegetables etc) This is a big problem. The Govt is just pumping poor people full of shitty food because they wont regulate it. How do we stop it?","filename":"DVDGrab","ext":".png","w":978,"h":487,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":124,"tim":1493344743698,"time":1493344743,"md5":"54MSynd2UWKoX4XUsDUDig==","fsize":59375,"resto":0,"id":"\/PSjmJj1","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"lets-talk-about-snap-food-benefits","country_name":"United States","replies":3,"images":0,"unique_ips":4},{"no":123127832,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)22:00:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"Just cut it all and starve them lmao","time":1493344824,"resto":123127652,"id":"E3SQw1i+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123128220,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)22:03:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"You probably eat like shit haha.<br><br>I was on this with my family for 3 months, we froze meat and bread with very little snack foods.","time":1493345000,"resto":123127652,"id":"UK5hjG58","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123128302,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)22:04:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123127652\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123127652<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;How do we stop it?<\/span><br>By doing literally anything other than making virtue signalling threads on \/pol\/ to circlejerk over.","time":1493345043,"resto":123127652,"id":"5b\/m22Xq","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

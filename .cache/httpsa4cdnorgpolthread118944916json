Would it be possible for Trump to make an offer to help eliminate partial college debt to anyone willing to help build the wall? We all know looming college debt is one of the major factors keeping 20 and 30-somethings from buying a house, settling down, raising a family, and securing their futures. Freeing up debt to willing workers will kickstart our lost generation. Imagine the liberals who&#039;d swallow their pride and work to eliminate their debt, learning valuable labor skills in the process, leading to instilling a better work ethic, humility, and possible redpills. After the wall is built, you&#039;d have tons of extra people with basic labor\/construction skills to help with future industry and infrastructure projects. I imagine this would gain bi-partisan support and turn a very controversial project into a highly praised one.","filename":"11432552-bricklayer-laying-bricks-to-make-a-wall-Stock-Photo-bricklayer-builders","ext":".jpg","w":1300,"h":878,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":168,"tim":1490895852681,"time":1490895852,"md5":"1RDo2zVhs7GvFHttVUyusg==","fsize":195558,"resto":0,"id":"r+Co\/Jpu","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"trump-forgives-college-debt-if-you-help-build-the","country_name":"United States","replies":5,"images":0,"unique_ips":4},{"no":118945028,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)13:45:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118944916\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118944916<\/a><br>Nah, forgive it if they fight in World War 3 against the Globalists.","time":1490895904,"resto":118944916,"id":"qXn5bzVZ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118945685,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)13:51:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118944916\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118944916<\/a><br>Just adding in, someone made a shitty facebook normie meme about this and I saw it get shared by a few liberal Mexians and their fiends.

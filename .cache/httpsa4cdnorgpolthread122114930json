So you need accuracy rates of 99.99% which is incredibly difficult. There are all sorts of tells, demographic and behavioral, but it takes something really special to identify innocents and terrorists nearly flawlessly.","time":1492764605,"resto":122114930,"id":"fOidgCvB","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122115552,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)04:50:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122114930\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122114930<\/a><br>Why don&#039;t we just hack the mainframe of our isps to download the raw data of the terrorists&#039; locations??","filename":"1477953230833","ext":".png","w":424,"h":318,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1492764648107,"time":1492764648,"md5":"Bj\/O9xR4aH8qrKw4HOQE\/g==","fsize":182018,"resto":122114930,"id":"ttSbZZfg","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122116332,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)05:02:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"Global Terrorism Database<br>http:\/\/www.start.umd.edu\/gtd\/contac<wbr>t\/","time":1492765367,"resto":122114930,"id":"vS+Wlsts","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122116521,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)05:05:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"45 Years of terrorism. global terrorism database.","filename":"IMG_9916","ext":".png","w":4894,"h":2189,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":55,"tim":1492765537782,"time":1492765537,"md5":"Rly8wq3mPwl5rQB9cO+sjA==","fsize":3032432,"resto":122114930,"id":"vS+Wlsts","country":"CA","m_img":1,"country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122116819,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)05:09:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122114930\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122114930<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;implying the powers that be don&#039;t already know about every attack before they happen<\/span><br>Swing and a miss.","time":1492765798,"resto":122114930,"id":"ffkadrIQ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122117722,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)05:24:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122116521\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122116521<\/a><br><a href=\"#p122116332\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122116332<\/a><br><br>TIME TO WRITE THE PERFECT AI USING MY SUPERCOMPUTER","filename":"iVHfwLc","ext":".gif","w":356,"h":200,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1492766689262,"time":1492766689,"md5":"6+2qC\/EnNt+EUrXjimDr4A==","fsize":3896640,"resto":122114930,"id":"hN6zO6hs","country":"NZ","country_name":"New Zealand"}]}

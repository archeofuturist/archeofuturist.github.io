It really decreases your motivation and focus which decreases your productivity. I don&#039;t need to go too far into those as its been said to death. My main argument for legalization though of getting rid of a black market and reducing pretty crime while removing the &quot;I&#039;m not supposed to do this so I will&quot; mentality so less youth get wrapped up in it.<br>In the US, I think it should be up to the states whether to do it or not, it should not be a federal issue. How this all turns out is very hard to predict though when the entire world&#039;s economy is held up by drug money. Without the drug money there would be an instant collapse. I don&#039;t feel like a global economic collapse is a good argument for keeping it and other drugs illegal though because I think a collapse would be a net positive.","time":1492661679,"resto":121948574,"id":"81GqC0ub","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121950780,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)00:18:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121949686\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121949686<\/a><br>it would probably increase the tobacco industry actually. current smokers will keep smoking tobacco and weed smokers buy a lot of cigarillos and shit to make blunts","time":1492661886,"resto":121948574,"id":"hLrWjeU2","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121951396,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)00:24:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"ISRAEL","filename":"1413551454947","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":548,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":114,"tim":1492662257411,"time":1492662257,"md5":"wWv\/um5SZQ4Eq6PgO+XH6Q==","fsize":197247,"resto":121948574,"id":"Ti1CEvGt","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121951551,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)00:25:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121948574\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121948574<\/a><br>yeah, he&#039;s busy tomorrow locking in his investment to weed growing and distribution companies","time":1492662340,"resto":121948574,"id":"8GEsN823","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

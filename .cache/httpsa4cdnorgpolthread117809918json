Fully automatic machine guns are illegal, as well as sawed-off shotguns or rifles. Those are firearms that once had a long barrel, but have had the barrel shortened for ease of use. The difference between a fully automatic machine gun and a semi-automatic machine gun is that a fully automatic machine gun can fire multiple shots with one pull of the trigger. With a semi-automatic gun, the trigger must be pulled for every shot.<\/span>","time":1490216980,"resto":117809918,"id":"O7jEqQqf","country":"SK","country_name":"Slovakia"},{"no":117826582,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)17:09:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117826345\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117826345<\/a><br>i used to work on a horse farm<br><br>i know they&#039;re crazy beasts of muscle<br><br>but i&#039;m honestly surprised it&#039;s that high, i was thinking 10 a year","time":1490216986,"resto":117809918,"id":"DI\/tsnIs","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117826680,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)17:10:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117826345\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117826345<\/a><br>Ban all wasps.<br><br>Bees are cool though.","filename":"1443923754564","ext":".png","w":1574,"h":1160,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":92,"tim":1490217022009,"time":1490217022,"md5":"xfTe5sO8\/VUWMTHX6uPddQ==","fsize":217518,"resto":117809918,"id":"jc8iS2uH","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117826824,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)17:11:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117826563\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117826563<\/a><br>Where the fuck are you getting your information?

Scarborough is currently on the warpath against Trump\u2019s campaign CEO Steve Bannon, with day-to-day rants portraying the White House chief strategist as incompetent or mentally unstable.<br><br>From American Greatness:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Before the election Scarborough repeatedly warned Republicans to cut and run from their nominee. In August, he gravely warned that for Republicans the election is \u201cabout saving the Senate, it\u2019s about not getting wiped out in the House, it\u2019s about not getting wiped out in the state legislatures and governorships. We have a lot to lose.\u201d<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Instead, Republicans won big in 2016 with Donald Trump. Not only did Donald Trump beat down the Democrats\u2019 vaunted Blue Wall of states from Wisconsin to North Carolina and win the White House, Republicans also retained control of both Houses of Congress and expanded their already impressive dominance at the state level\u2014leaving wise men like Joe Scarborough with egg on their faces.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;But he stills wants us to take him seriously when he says that Steve Bannon is stupid and can\u2019t implement the putting together of a ham sandwich. Yet Scarborough\u2019s only claim to authority is that he had a brief stint as a Congressman and now has a show on MSNBC. That show is, presumably, built around his alleged insights or practical wisdom. That is, at best, a tautology.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;It may have escaped the notice of folks who appear regularly on Morning Joe, but Bannon and Co. won. What\u2019s more they tapped into an innate political sensibility that bridges the Right-Left political settlement that has ruled for the past 30 years and, in so doing, they threaten the established political order.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;But in Joe Scarborough\u2019s world Bannon, who got the election right, is \u201cstupid.\u201d<\/span>","filename":"1468230701450","ext":".jpg","w":503,"h":640,"tn_w":98,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492084530433,"time":1492084530,"md5":"MqQrac5YujbJdNPodGW9QA==","fsize":251711,"resto":120900326,"id":"CEyPt9Jy","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120901511,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)07:55:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120901431\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120901431<\/a><br>fuck off shill","time":1492084532,"resto":120900326,"id":"XjBvGE3B","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120901522,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)07:55:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120901427\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120901427<\/a><br>Bannon is still there.","time":1492084540,"resto":120900326,"id":"T6WwE7AI","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120901529,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)07:55:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120901005\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120901005<\/a><br>WTF I love the deep state now","time":1492084546,"resto":120900326,"id":"J3yYsPyV","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120901530,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)07:55:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120901488\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120901488<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Pout face on<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Fingertips connected<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;H- Hi Mr Abe, welcome to A-<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What is his face<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;employ last measure defences<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;thigh over leg<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;hand over my bursting boner<\/span>","filename":"meeting","ext":".jpg","w":650,"h":380,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":73,"tim":1492084546850,"time":1492084546,"md5":"QqmByDBouEQwfydlm0leLQ==","fsize":39520,"resto":120900326,"id":"eNU0lYgc","country":"JE","country_name":"Jersey"},{"no":120901538,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)07:55:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120901307\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120901307<\/a><br>The dollar too strong instead of auditing the fed and nationalizing money.

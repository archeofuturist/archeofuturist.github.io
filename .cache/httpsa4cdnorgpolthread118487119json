Think of it like this: A democratically elected leader of a country only has responsibility over that country for the duration of time they rule it. Anything that comes after (whether a result of their policies or not) will be blamed on the current politician in power. So, in effect, they merely have to provide the illusion of prosperity, safety, national unity, etc., etc. for a few years. They also don&#039;t have a stake in the country&#039;s future other than to continue their own rule\/fill their own personal coffers with wealth.<br>Monarchs, on the other hand, have all of the responsibility for the entire future of the country. They must keep their lands healthy and prosperous for their progeny. Any negative result of a policy\/rule put forth by the monarch will not fall upon the shoulders of some random, unrelated person, but unto themselves or their children. For these reasons, they must do what is best for their country.<br><br>Keep in mind that what is best for somebody is not always what they want. In addition, what somebody needs is not merely what they need for survival. Your wants literally always leave you wanting.","time":1490601608,"resto":118487119,"id":"Hk53t+Lc","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118488594,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)04:02:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118487119\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118487119<\/a><br>Only if the royal family is for a republic kingdom.","filename":"1445698087531","ext":".jpg","w":225,"h":350,"tn_w":80,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490601751111,"time":1490601751,"md5":"Tr9XhX0645kJZYlXxGlCfg==","fsize":35998,"resto":118487119,"id":"16rtzasw","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118488831,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)04:06:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"My country got fucked in the ass and all structures went to shit when nobility gained freedom to legally not respect anything king says and every noble was able to represent the businesses of any side he got his power and money from.

It was given to the USA upon her death, was never used and the USA gave it back to her estate in the late 1970&#039;s. President Trump first offered $15 million for the estate in 1980, he continued to make offers for less and less until he purchased the estate for $5 million in 1985. The President is now using Mar a lago as the original owner intended. Additionally, it is probably more secure and not bugged like the White House and Camp David.","time":1491778215,"resto":120337899,"id":"vpxMhlIt","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120351195,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)18:50:37","name":"Anonymous","filename":"Capture","ext":".png","w":676,"h":364,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":67,"tim":1491778237750,"time":1491778237,"md5":"3BRuuI\/29yi3MG+WSEwnPQ==","fsize":179930,"resto":120337899,"id":"tfXD5UJn","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120351213,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)18:50:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120350863\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120350863<\/a><br>get ready for four more years of cognitive dissonance, the wild ride is only just starting","filename":"1485197466863","ext":".jpg","w":373,"h":332,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":111,"tim":1491778244831,"time":1491778244,"md5":"016Wfof9ipO+JLOtNaVgbg==","fsize":46567,"resto":120337899,"id":"Tg707pER","country":"UY","country_name":"Uruguay"},{"no":120351215,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)18:50:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120350917\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120350917<\/a><br>Go back where?","time":1491778245,"resto":120337899,"id":"eCyhAWvb","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120351222,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)18:50:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"Any proof?","time":1491778248,"resto":120337899,"id":"mux7jZKB","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120351274,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)18:51:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120347682\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120347682<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;tax payers are white<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;guy with hand out is brown<\/span><br>checks out","time":1491778272,"resto":120337899,"id":"O\/UD\/Qv+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120351370,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)18:51:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120342072\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120342072<\/a><br>the fact that there&#039;s so much time downtime in a golf game is what makes it suited to diplomacy","time":1491778309,"resto":120337899,"id":"wHMG3KqZ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120351397,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)18:52:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"We should be paying for it.

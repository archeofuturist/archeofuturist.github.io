But that&#039;s wouldn&#039;t work long-term, right? It worked for Hitler only because rich Americans and Britons supported him financially, as I understand it. How can he be enlightened to the fact that Capitalism is a normal form of society?","filename":"kotleba","ext":".jpg","w":800,"h":450,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1490098944866,"time":1490098944,"md5":"s1k5l00f5aRSQuCFaLJJzA==","fsize":62069,"resto":0,"id":"bWe8QqxX","country":"SK","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"serious-can-national-socialist-be-steered-more","country_name":"Slovakia","replies":3,"images":1,"unique_ips":2},{"no":117620315,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)08:34:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117619366\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117619366<\/a><br>Hi Slovak-bro! It&#039;s in my belief, as a right-leaning libertarian, that NatSoc begins setting up a government and people for Fascism. But Fascism isn&#039;t a sustainable form of government long-term. In a post-Fascist society, the ruling government must scale back and begin to let free market influence decision, or else you&#039;d be in a perpetual state of war and wasting resources. Post-Fascism will awaken and enlighten those who remain, thus more of a less-regulated Libertarian type government would work better due to the heightened nature of man. Essentially, sometimes you have to go all 1488 before you try a less regulated form of govt that heavily relies on the nature of man.","filename":"no3qwx1soC1tqzfi6o1_500","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":497,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":124,"tim":1490099666037,"time":1490099666,"md5":"7euGAL3svIymGywPzY77Gg==","fsize":66873,"resto":117619366,"id":"b5hjKSlq","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117620560,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)08:37:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117619366\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117619366<\/a><br>Also, my great-grandma is from Slovakia, from a little Eastern farm town called Zalobin.

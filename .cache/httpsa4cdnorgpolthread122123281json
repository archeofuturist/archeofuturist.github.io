She will then offer up, in answer, a combination of fact, opinion and debate that will be as inspiring as it is important. <br><br>Zoe Williams brings together here all the arguments that occupy the current political landscape and shows us that on all levels, it\u2019s lunacy to be anything other than left-wing unless you\u2019re actually already an oligarch. She offers us the debate in a truly entertaining way - she\u2019s pacey, conversational and funny. This is a road map for a better future that will be a major part of the debate in the run up to the election next May.","filename":"51uF9PhWRPL[1]","ext":".jpg","w":310,"h":500,"tn_w":77,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492772960205,"time":1492772960,"md5":"9vQ9LmHdoUx70HeSHzakFQ==","fsize":53067,"resto":122123281,"id":"qhYD9ugE","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122124452,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)07:09:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"friendly reminder these women should all unironically be in the kitchen right now.","time":1492772968,"resto":122123281,"id":"Ox4TE3Ow","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122124466,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)07:09:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"In May We Trust","filename":"E6514142-CB3F-4CF2-9EED-9EBBB7560F12-4721-0000031BCA2B6292","ext":".jpg","w":400,"h":415,"tn_w":120,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492772981565,"time":1492772981,"md5":"htX9tq0XHCIW4aZsrl7XlQ==","fsize":62169,"resto":122123281,"id":"YnTNSMFp","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122124482,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)07:09:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"Friendly reminder to filter foreskin australian","time":1492772992,"resto":122123281,"id":"100TO17B","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122124485,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)07:09:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122124384\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122124384<\/a><br>quality Aussie post<br><br>classic","time":1492772994,"resto":122123281,"id":"QwM+6qB1","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122124495,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)07:10:02","name":"\u56de","com":"<a href=\"#p122124384\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122124384<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;He&#039;s back<\/span>","filename":"1485250826818","ext":".jpg","w":570,"h":819,"tn_w":86,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492773002604,"time":1492773002,"md5":"9WyFCB5e2Z1VgQoghkzjtg==","fsize":84973,"resto":122123281,"id":"OVAjhLz+","country":"GB","trip":"!!FJ60XUrqjrt","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122124497,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)07:10:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122124418\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122124418<\/a><br><br>Why circumcised?","time":1492773004,"resto":122123281,"id":"dNvv2tU9","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":122124506,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)07:10:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"Jeeeeesus just look at Zoe Williams body language whilst she&#039;s getting scolded, literally shaking and fidgeting like a dog with their tail between their legs<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;rejecting pluralism is FASCIST<\/span>","filename":"1489499183975","ext":".jpg","w":466,"h":466,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":124,"tim":1492773011184,"time":1492773011,"md5":"6AfN9HpR6A1B9SjqeVI8zA==","fsize":65477,"resto":122123281,"id":"uGrwE\/9C","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122124513,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)07:10:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122124420\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122124420<\/a><br>She even claimed Le Pen was trying to centalise power in the presidency, when she has said nothing of the sort.","time":1492773014,"resto":122123281,"id":"AVqE2JYG","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122124520,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)07:10:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"so Zoe Williams literally just said that she wants to end free speech for anyone she labels a fascist<br><br>that&#039;s pretty fascist of her","time":1492773019,"resto":122123281,"id":"qhYD9ugE","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122124527,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)07:10:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122124262\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122124262<\/a><br>vote conservatibe if you cant vote ukip<br>vote conservative if you not in a concervative zone<br>vote ukip if you are in a conservative zone<br>vote ukip if you are in a ukip zone<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;NW bristol is concervative<\/span>","filename":"BREXIT win pol plan stage 1","ext":".png","w":1025,"h":881,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":107,"tim":1492773025230,"time":1492773025,"md5":"yjRmSXOTChCbqLUKc0bJMg==","fsize":388127,"resto":122123281,"id":"1DvkpgRU","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122124552,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)07:10:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122124035\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122124035<\/a><br>I-I want headpats from all Anglo-senpais. . .

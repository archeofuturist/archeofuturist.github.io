A communist system would thus free individuals from alienation in the sense of having one&#039;s life structured around survival (making a wage or salary in a capitalist system), which Marx referred to as a transition from the &quot;realm of necessity&quot; to the &quot;realm of freedom.&quot; As a result, a communist society is envisioned as being composed of an intellectually-inclined population with both the time and resources to pursue its creative hobbies and genuine interests, and to contribute to creative social wealth in this manner. Karl Marx considered &quot;true richness&quot; to be the amount of time one has at his or her disposal to pursue one&#039;s creative passions. Marx&#039;s notion of communism is in this way radically individualistic.","filename":"7f9777c7aa921c0d165505ffaed788b9df7f798715b9d66637af0f3cc2bd1928","ext":".jpg","w":700,"h":933,"tn_w":93,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491487024629,"time":1491487024,"md5":"cAPHLuA35v6eT85c3T8vaw==","fsize":292634,"resto":119738375,"id":"cBjglqJv","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":119744925,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)09:59:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119739441\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119739441<\/a><br>No shit, stupid","time":1491487140,"resto":119738375,"id":"BPZLAiKp","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119744966,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)09:59:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119742930\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119742930<\/a><br>It was easier to screenshot, MY FUCKIN BAD","time":1491487176,"resto":119738375,"id":"eptbxWFX","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

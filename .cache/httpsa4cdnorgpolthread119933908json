To be honest I like it, especially the niche subreddits.<br>What I really fucking hate though are the users. Fuck them all they&#039;re so fucking smug and self satisfied. There&#039;s just something about the way they comment that really infuriates me. Would that every redditor had one face so that I could punch it repeatedly, forever.<br>For example, let us assume that an anon from 4chan and a user from reddit were to reply &quot;you are such a faggot&quot; to a truly abhorrent post. One deserving to be called a &quot;faggot&quot;. We&#039;ve all been there. How do you suppose the userbase of both websites would respond to your witty remark? Here&#039;s what 4chan would do:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;nah you&#039;re a faggot<\/span><br>And then they&#039;d move on. Here&#039;s how reddit would reply<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;REEEEEEEEE omg you can&#039;t call people rude names what&#039;s your problem are you some sort of violent racist psychopath <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;cue the user getting ten trillion down arrows, b&amp; from the subreddit, b&amp; from reddit, and then IP b&amp; for good measure<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;and then everyone starts riding each other&#039;s dicks over what a good job they did by eliminating any possible discussion or critical thought through the use of their piece of shit voting system<\/span><br>They punish dissent by making it invisible. Not just dissent even, just colourful language in general because apparently they can&#039;t handle being called a few rude words. <br>Seriously tho fuck reddit I hate it.","filename":"plebbit","ext":".png","w":310,"h":310,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":249,"tim":1491565491404,"time":1491565491,"md5":"yPHQIMAsxfcrNdwUmN\/rTA==","fsize":25349,"resto":0,"id":"t2n16H8W","country":"AU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"i-wanna-vent-some-steam-not-specifically-over","country_name":"Australia","replies":8,"images":2,"unique_ips":8},{"no":119934041,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)07:46:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119933908\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119933908<\/a><br>\/pol\/ is not your blog","time":1491565567,"resto":119933908,"id":"kZGXkQ1Y","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119934235,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)07:47:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119933908\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119933908<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;THIS USER WAS BANNED FOR THIS POST<\/span>","time":1491565670,"resto":119933908,"id":"8eb6ZeIZ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119934247,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)07:47:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119933908\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119933908<\/a><br>Stay on reddit you fucking faggot you clearly belong there","time":1491565675,"resto":119933908,"id":"dijCl7TV","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119934426,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)07:49:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119934041\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119934041<\/a><br><a href=\"#p119934235\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119934235<\/a><br><a href=\"#p119934247\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119934247<\/a><br>I thought you guys were my friends","filename":"sad guts","ext":".jpg","w":208,"h":251,"tn_w":103,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491565770270,"time":1491565770,"md5":"dhtT+yixJVVNDQUGMcq3+Q==","fsize":12591,"resto":119933908,"id":"t2n16H8W","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":119934531,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)07:50:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"fuck reddit","time":1491565828,"resto":119933908,"id":"rK6AzpWz","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119936052,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)08:03:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;piece of shit voting system<\/span><br>this, many of subreddits is 100% circlejerk","filename":"14773047852050","ext":".jpg","w":1536,"h":864,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1491566612480,"time":1491566612,"md5":"bkcBqIAJzusRk617GQLidQ==","fsize":357761,"resto":119933908,"id":"mCV+6uyq","country":"RU","m_img":1,"country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":119936378,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)08:06:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119934426\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119934426<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Welcome to \/pol\/ - Politically Incorrect<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;This board is for the discussion of news, world events, political issues, and other related topics.<\/span>","time":1491566782,"resto":119933908,"id":"63WvEFH5","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119937135,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)08:13:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119934426\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119934426<\/a><br>nah you&#039;re just a faggot","time":1491567195,"resto":119933908,"id":"Zy0u4sB7","country":"IT","country_name":"Italy"}]}

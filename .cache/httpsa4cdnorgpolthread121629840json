Why bother typing these things out when I know you&#039;re just going to do your best to plug your ears and pretend they either don&#039;t matter or didn&#039;t happen?<br><br>You ask what he did not stick to. Two of the things I outlined were so blatant that only a fucking retard, like you, could ignore them. He said he would self-fund his campaign. He did not. No amount of excuses or downplaying it is going to change that he lied about it. He received funding from other people, including corporations. Fact. You cannot dodge this.<br><br>No amount of excuses will change that he utterly reversed his position on H1B. He IS ON CAMERA, DURING AN INTERNATIONALLY TELEVISED LIVE DEBATE watched by millions...admitting that he CHANGED HIS POSITION, from his own fucking mouth, and you are still denying it.<br><br>I don&#039;t know what else to even say to you.

As a San Francisco Bay Area resident, my family was a waning minority in the face of an influx of inferior races. Many of my issues in school had to do with some coon or spic or island nigger excluding me by my skin color, calling me horrible names, rejecting me in their games...as I grew older, I fell into a deep depression because I could make no friends in high school. Not that I wanted some subhuman trash for friends, but they consistently pretended I did not exist, and the more radicalised of them asserted that I had the original sin of whiteness. <br><br>Then they began to profile me as a burgeoning school shooter. They actively got in my life and in my face and coddled me to make sure I wasn&#039;t going to bring a gun to school. But I was so tired with all of those niggers that I never felt an urge. <br><br>I&#039;m finally glad to get out of this god forsaken town. I want nothing to do with diversity. Thankfully our family has a mostly white, upper-class neighborhood in mind, in the Valley. And guess what? Their schools are doing excellent, their community is clean, English is the lingua franca, and little to no gang violence. What a paradise! I hope we move there.","filename":"muslim-garb","ext":".jpg","w":545,"h":359,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":164,"tim":1491457695754,"time":1491457695,"md5":"KhApr0u9PXtXpjg6SW5sIg==","fsize":32560,"resto":0,"id":"yzeJwZnw","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"a-chance-to-flee-cultural-marxism","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":119712496,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)01:57:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119711745\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119711745<\/a><br>\/pol\/ is not your personal blog<br><br>Good luck though","time":1491458262,"resto":119711745,"id":"7Rv0bczB","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"}]}

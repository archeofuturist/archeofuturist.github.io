Not only will the US dollar be worthless by the time I reach retirement age...But property tax rates will be sky high. Health care will be even more expensive. And the retirement age will be pushed until 80 or something so about 75% of us will never even reach retirement age. And last most of us don&#039;t even have a home paid off, it&#039;s fucking retarded to save money for retirement when most old people still aren&#039;t even done paying a mortgage.","time":1492220279,"resto":121147085,"id":"0XCI8gF6","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

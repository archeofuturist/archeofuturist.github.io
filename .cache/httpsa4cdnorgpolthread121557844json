Midazolam has been used in a number of high-profile botched executions, including instances where inmates did not appear to be fully sedated when they received the painful second and third drugs in the cocktail. The suit argued there was an unacceptably high risk they would suffer during the executions.<br><br>The judge determined that their concerns were sufficient to halt the executions for the time being, to allow the issue to be considered by the courts.<br><br>Hutchinson and state Attorney General Leslie Rutledge have been pushing to carry out the executions anyway. But they are on a tight schedule: Executions were scheduled to begin Monday night, and if the legal proceedings take more than two weeks, the midazolam supply will have expired before any of the executions can take place.<br><br>The state has appealed both rulings and asked the higher courts to work quickly to review the decisions. The inmates on death row, meanwhile, have asked the courts to take the time and avoid a &quot;rushed analysis.&quot;<br><br>Arkansas&#039; attorney general also asked the state Supreme Court to reconsider the stay it granted one inmate, over questions about his mental health; the court rejected that request, keeping that stay in place, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports.<br><br>If the rulings are overturned by Monday night, the state will be prepared to execute at least one inmate, according to local TV station KATV.<br><br>&quot;Davis&#039; exact schedule for the day is confidential but as part of the death protocol, he will be meeting with counsel and a spiritual adviser,&quot; KATV reports. &quot;Authorities say a last meal has also been arranged.&quot;<br><br>Arkansas hasn&#039;t executed anybody for more than a decade, partly because of a series of legal challenges to the state&#039;s death penalty laws.","filename":"midazolam","ext":".jpg","w":800,"h":800,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492452800677,"time":1492452800,"md5":"IPCjs48mHKOTIgjXZHd4ZA==","fsize":87322,"resto":0,"id":"HZH37mzq","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"arkansas-still-planning-executions-despite-court","country_name":"United States","replies":24,"images":3,"unique_ips":14},{"no":121557935,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)14:14:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121557844\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121557844<\/a><br>Does \/pol\/ support the death penalty?","time":1492452843,"resto":121557844,"id":"HZH37mzq","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121558965,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)14:22:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121557844\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121557844<\/a><br>bump","time":1492453322,"resto":121557844,"id":"FBHUvPe+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121559064,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)14:22:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121557844\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121557844<\/a><br>It&#039;s damn near impossible for someone to OD on benzo&#039;s alone.

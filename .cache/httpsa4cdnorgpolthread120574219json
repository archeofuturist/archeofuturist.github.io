Is Mark Cuckerberg really needed 877,771x more than the average American? Is Facebook really needed 877,771x more than goods and services provided by the average American? No, because there is simply no such thing as heirarchy of need. Parts are either needed or they aren&#039;t - the machine either works or it doesn&#039;t. Get rid of janitors, and the whole system breaks down. Get rid of faggots who make needless social media websites, and the world would be a better place.<br><br>In a free-market system, what really decides who makes what, and why is it fair?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;inb4 you&#039;re just whining<\/span><br>not an explanation<br><br>A better system would be if what people get paid were in direct proportion to how many years they went to school, and enforced by law or some such, regardless of what the job is. Like, if you didn&#039;t go to college, you make (n+y+1)x amount. n = number of years of college attended. So generally, if you went for 1 year, you make 2x, if 2 years 3x, 3 years 4x, 4 years 5x etc. (n+y+1)x = profits\/(number of employees+sum of all n+y)performance\/z+(z-performance)\/z<wbr>*profits\/(number of employees+sum of all n+y). y = number of times you started the company up to 1.<br><br>The existence of the obscenely rich necessitates the existence of the poor. This would eliminate most of the wealth going to people who don&#039;t produce anything valuable all because consumers are stupid.<br><br>Capitalism is flawed because it has no mechanism to counteract the stupidity of consumers, and thus literally creates poverty. Why should janitors have shitty lives? Poverty is only necessary because the system allows few people to manipulate stupid people into giving them their money. Look at websites, for example. The only reason most websites make money (including Facebook) is because there still exists people stupid enough not to use an ad blocker.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;inb4 muh communism! autistic screeching<\/span><br>This would more accurately be a better capitalism.","filename":"9QsEqZD[1]","ext":".jpg","w":960,"h":720,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1491899608581,"time":1491899608,"md5":"DZZj1Tc1runqvwvS3Y7c3w==","fsize":68308,"resto":0,"id":"jKHvYNd7","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"what-decides-that-doctors-and-lawyers-make-the","country_name":"United States","replies":7,"images":2,"unique_ips":8},{"no":120574673,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)04:39:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120574219\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120574219<\/a><br>the simplest non-answer i can give you is that all the technology and infrastructure that makes modern medicine possible is extremely expensive and finding candidates that are capable of being rigorously trained to use the equipment and techniques is in itself a rigorous and time-consuming effort. this is not to mention the actual training itself, which takes a decade or so and utilizes all of these resources.<br>i know that didn&#039;t really answer your question, but ya fuckin&#039; read it anyhow didn&#039;t ya?","time":1491899999,"resto":120574219,"id":"AjE6P4C5","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120575058,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)04:44:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120574219\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120574219<\/a><br>Law is a saturated as fuck field and attorneys don&#039;t even make that much, but their work is hard as fuck.

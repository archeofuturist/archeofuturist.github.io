The moab does not have a one mile kill zone radius, it&#039;s 150 meters. If it was a mile it would make it comparable to little boy! <br><br>Let me explain.<br>Moab has a yield of 11 tons.<br>Little boy had a yield of 15,000 tons.<br>That&#039;s 15 kilotons compared to .011 kilotons. <br><br>Little boy had a blast radius of .8 of a mile, anything within that most likely died, few exceptions. <br>Moab has a blast radius of 150 meters, anything within that most likely dies.<br>And yes, they were both air blasts. <br><br>And I&#039;ll throw this in there for you all to ponder. We have bombs in the megatons, a megaton is 1 million tons.","filename":"MoabExplosion","ext":".png","w":400,"h":300,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1492141011741,"time":1492141011,"md5":"FwJrewsKv4OSMT0HIhuiGw==","fsize":170940,"resto":0,"id":"B\/KNkXpm","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"im-going-to-make-a-thread-about-this-because-i","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

The moab does not have a one mile kill zone radius, it&#039;s 150 meters. If it was a mile it would make it comparable to little boy! <br><br>Let me explain.<br>Moab has a yield of 11 tons.<br>Little boy had a yield of 15,000 tons.<br>That&#039;s 15 kilotons compared to .011 kilotons. <br><br>Little boy had a blast radius of .8 of a mile, anything within that most likely died, few exceptions. <br>Moab has a blast radius of 150 meters, anything within that most likely dies.<br>And yes, they were both air blasts. <br><br>And I&#039;ll throw this in there for you all to ponder.

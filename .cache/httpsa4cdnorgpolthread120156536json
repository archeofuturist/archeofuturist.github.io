Trump isn&#039;t trying to placate claims he&#039;s a Russian agent. We all know who runs the media. They will run with these claims to blackmail him. What do they really want? One thing. Greater Israel. And greater Israel can&#039;t happen until it&#039;s running from the Nile to the Euphrates.<br><br>This won&#039;t be the last strike Trump does on Syria, but the next one might cost him a few ships from what I hear. The one after that will cost him jets and potentially a base. The one after that will cost him Israel, and that will be the beginning of Armageddon.<br><br>Trump will not carry out further attacks for a while, but will support terrorists more than even Obama did. He will also support Kurdish terrorists because Israel needs a second state beyond the Euphrates that is allied with it. These Kurdish terrorists will be killing Christians in Syria and Iraq but Trump and the media will remain silent.<br><br>All of this is going to accelerate to a crescendo until 2020, the final year of Trump&#039;s first term and around the election when Trump will carry out the final attacks. This is because he will fall for the threats of taking away his second term.<br><br>I didn&#039;t think Trump would sell out like this, but he&#039;s under incredible pressure, with threats against his family. You have 3 years and 6 month to prepare for the worst, even there I&#039;m potentially being too generous.<br><br>Screenshot this post for later.","filename":"C85_aw3VYAENAVB","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":576,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1491672474510,"time":1491672474,"md5":"L6q1C4ZEn8l7Ptt0q4A1jg==","fsize":87298,"resto":0,"id":"VyniC9ND","country":"AU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"trump-is-carrying-out-a-34-year-old-israeli-plan","country_name":"Australia","replies":44,"images":8,"unique_ips":35},{"no":120156644,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)13:28:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"Tump is a mossad agent","time":1491672524,"resto":120156536,"id":"\/KTsgu4u","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":120156833,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)13:30:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120156644\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120156644<\/a><br>Mossad hacked Clinton.

Silver actually made fun of the idea of unskewing polls while not actually addressing what the criticism was regarding the skewing (oversampling groups seemingly strategically). So he had a huge amount of faith in what those various polls were saying and just didn&#039;t change from it until the end came. <br><br>His problem was that he didn&#039;t keep his prediction from earlier and instead adjusted it to show Trump higher at the end. Others kept their predictions low and kept their reputations, like the guy that ate a bug on CNN.

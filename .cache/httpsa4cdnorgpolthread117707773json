VERHALEN EN SPROOKJES in 1949? It was published 2 years after the famous diary. Designed and illustrated by Kees Kelfkens. A collection of simple stories and fairy-tales for Dutch children, written by Anne Frank at the age of 14, while in hiding. Primo Levi suggested that Anne Frank is frequently identified as a single representative of the millions of people who suffered and died as she did because &quot;One single Anne Frank moves us more than the countless others who suffered just as she did but whose faces have remained in the shadows. Perhaps it is better that way; if we were capable of taking in all the suffering of all those people, we would not be able to live.&quot;<br><br>Otto Frank, Anne\u2019s father spent the remainder of his life after publication of the Diary as custodian of his daughter&#039;s legacy, saying, &quot;It&#039;s a strange role. In the normal family relationship, it is the child of the famous parent who has the honor and the burden of continuing the task. In my case the role is reversed.&quot;","filename":"KH-2-12","ext":".jpg","w":493,"h":656,"tn_w":187,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490150215516,"time":1490150215,"md5":"yumKZW4aHD93l8EiG+qUEg==","fsize":148214,"resto":0,"id":"m080sstB","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"anne-frank-wrote-another-book","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":117709515,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)22:51:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117707773\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117707773<\/a><br>Kek, I wonder why we haven&#039;t heard of this?

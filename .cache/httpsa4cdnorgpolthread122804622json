The 4 letters represent your dominant attitude, CONSCIOUS cognitive functions and what you extrovert. Function categories are Perception (iNtuition and Sensation) and Judging (Thinking and Feeling). Each of these is either extroverted or introverted, but work in pairs. For each extraverted trait you have an introverted one. Using my keklord Rh- ENTP self as an example:<br>NT - iNtuition and Thinking dominate my personality<br>E - my dominant trait is whichever one (N or T) is extroverted<br>P - I extrovert my Perception function N. <br>N is my DOMINANT trait, noted as Ne. I must introvert my AUXILIARY trait, noted as Ti. So the bulk of my personality is described by my Ne - Ti pairing. <br><br>For introverts, don&#039;t be tripped up by P and J - they say what you extrovert, but whichever main trait you introvert is your dominant one. <br><br>When you plebs think you&#039;re changing types you&#039;re exercising your TERTIARY trait - the polar opposite of your auxiliary trait, Ne - Fe for me in my case. Properly using your tertiary trait takes discipline, like working a muscle, since it&#039;s the same attitude as your dominant trait. Your last conscious trait is your INFERIOR one. It&#039;s the polar opposite of your dominant trait, Si for me. Unless you&#039;re retarded, you can&#039;t exert your dominant and inferior traits at the same time. You have little control over your inferior trait, it&#039;s like having a 3 year old take over your body. It comes out when you&#039;re VERY stressed. So next time you&#039;re panicking hard, think of it. Si - Ti usually shows when I panic. When any type reverts to their Inferior trait they are &#039;in the grip&#039; - different symptoms per type, anxiety for ENTP. Getting stuck using your tertiary more than your auxiliary is called being in a dom-tert loop - looks like mania for ENTP since we&#039;ll be 100% extroverted too long.","filename":"PTypesExplainedForPlebs","ext":".png","w":602,"h":418,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":173,"tim":1493162133453,"time":1493162133,"md5":"2cH0urlAtzZOyKMdTXmDHA==","fsize":153710,"resto":0,"id":"vsfyN0Z9","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"personality-redpill","country_name":"United States","replies":50,"images":1,"unique_ips":23},{"no":122805575,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)19:23:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"Op has a point.","time":1493162597,"resto":122804622,"id":"C6YMR3UL","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122806023,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)19:26:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"what","time":1493162803,"resto":122804622,"id":"3n4W0Msw","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":122806234,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)19:28:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122804622\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122804622<\/a><br>INTJ here: Ni Te Fi Se","time":1493162904,"resto":122804622,"id":"sN1Pg6x9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122806452,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)19:30:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"What is Si?","time":1493163007,"resto":122804622,"id":"4U5qsdnZ","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":122806491,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)19:30:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122806023\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122806023<\/a><br>German.

A lot of the social situations it goes over involve ones I either have never been in or can&#039;t remember being in. I think I frantically am anxious over my behaviour in social settings but then cannot remember it afterwards. I can&#039;t remember or tell at all whether I&#039;m a planner or if I am impulsive. I believe plans are more important and better but noting my own behaviour I find my laziness and lack of knowledge take over.<br><br>My life is on a good course right now and I see no major issues in the future, but I still very much hate myself and believe everything -will- eventually fall apart. As you said, I am doomed to fail in life.","time":1493171424,"resto":122804622,"id":"hr1DFzsF","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122824191,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)21:50:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122822206\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122822206<\/a><br>If you learn to leverage your Ne more and turn y our brain off then no.

I am not a big advocate of drugs... but I know when I take opiates or benzos, e.g. percocets and xanax my Ti shuts off. This may work for you? I don&#039;t suggest alcohol for ENTP or INTP. Maybe talk with a doc about going on valium (like extended release xanax) or some kind of anti-anxiety (SSRI type) if you haven&#039;t tried it yet.","time":1493171432,"resto":122804622,"id":"vsfyN0Z9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122824437,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)21:52:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"INTP 4chan master here reporting.<br><br>You never change personality, not only that but you&#039;re almost always in your 1st function and takes effort to even get to the 2nd one.","time":1493171541,"resto":122804622,"id":"FpuPteBc","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122824585,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)21:53:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122804622\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122804622<\/a><br>okay im an ENTP too.<br><br>What&#039;s the inferior exactly mean?<br><br> si comes out when I&#039;m stressed in what form?<br><br>fe is my tertiary which I should learn to control better?

You&#039;re not allowed to leave. How would an outside observer describe your interactions? Would they say you engage others with questions or curiosity or would they say you share &#039;facts&#039;. By telling them how it is I mean do you often state things matter-of-factually? Inquisitiveness and curiosity are mainly an Ne trait. Someone in this situation that tries to connect with others by saying things like how terrible a dance is, how amazing a concert is or how retarded a speaker is would be more INTJ.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I remember doing that when I was much younger but nowadays I shut down and apologize even if I don&#039;t need to, then withdraw and look for &quot;a way out&quot; in the form of leaving the area to withdrawing from agreements or jobs to suicide.<\/span><br>Sounds like you may be stuck in &#039;the grip.&#039; Each type goes through different things in the grip. INTP and ENTPs don&#039;t tend to think about suicide as that&#039;s more of an Ni-Se swap. Your inferior Se knows the attention &#039;suicide&#039; gets. Sounds like you went through something pretty traumatic at a younger age that you tried to cope with. You haven&#039;t fully rebounded, else you wouldn&#039;t do any of the things you said as an INTJ or INTP. However, an INTJ &#039;in the grip&#039; would. When you slip into the grip, you are going from Ni dominant to Se dominant. You&#039;re letting a 3 year old take hold of the wheel and steer you. You are trying to see the eyes through an Se dominant person, who understands the world through actions and the concreteness of things. However, your brain is meant to find meaning so it&#039;s terrible at Se things. I&#039;m rambling about it. <br><br>tldr - you seem INTJ but getting stuck in the grip. You need to gain some confidence and stop giving a fuck about others and let your body do its thing.

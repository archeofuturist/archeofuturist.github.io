about Preu\u00dfe, you little bitch? I\u2019ll have you know he graduated top of his class in the Universit\u00e4t Flensburg, and he&#039;s been involved in numerous secret raids on Schlesien, and has over 300 confirmed kills. He is trained in Clausewitzian warfare and is the Obersturmf\u00fchrer of the entire Schleswig-Holstein armed forces. You are nothing to him but just another Inselaffe. He will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Sceptred Isle, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to Preu\u00dfe over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak he is contacting his secret network of spies across the Reich and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for der Angriff, Schweinhund. Der Angriff that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You\u2019re fucking dead, kid. He can be anywhere, anytime, and he can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that\u2019s just with his Flammenwerfer. Not only is he extensively trained in Auftragstaktik, but he has access to the entire arsenal of the Deutsches Heer, and he will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little \u201cpatriotic\u201d comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn\u2019t, you didn\u2019t, and now you\u2019re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. He will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it.

Thre are videos of them assaulting people, testimonies of former members giving accounts to illegal activities the group took part in.<br><br>How the fuck none of anons organized yet full-scale spread of information about this? Sure, Felarca got some shit when admitting to and supporting use of violence on TV interview but the whole group is still pretty fine. Mayor of Berkeley is a supporter if not a member of the group, too. I&#039;d assume that US anons would tear apart that shit with more gusto than HWNDU, especially since it&#039;s not even delusional virtue-signalling against the president, but outright lawless propagation of violence, ironically supposedly fighting against nazi but in reality employing nazi attitude against common folks.<br><br>Holy shit, you really should start doing something against those groups of yours - commie-feminists, BLM, BAMN all seem to be doing opposite of what good values they claim to stand for. Why are there no lawsuits and constant calls for authorities to look into Berkeley&#039;s mayor actions as well as actions of those groups?","filename":"maxresdefault[1]","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":720,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1493549368491,"time":1493549368,"md5":"pjtU+fkJtvIV4VN65pvsDA==","fsize":133981,"resto":0,"id":"OWprQfBR","country":"PL","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"bamn-burgerlanders-please-explain","country_name":"Poland","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

Mortal man views even his physical environment from the mind level, from the perspective of its psychological registry. It is not, therefore, strange that man should place a highly unified interpretation upon the universe and then seek to identify this energy unity of his science with the spirit unity of his religious experience. Mind is unity; mortal consciousness lives on the mind level and perceives the universal realities through the eyes of the mind endowment. The mind perspective will not yield the existential unity of the source of reality, the First Source and Center, but it can and sometime will portray to man the experiential synthesis of energy, mind, and spirit in and as the Supreme Being. But mind can never succeed in this unification of the diversity of reality unless such mind is firmly aware of material things, intellectual meanings, and spiritual values; only in the harmony of the triunity of functional reality is there unity, and only in unity is there the personality satisfaction of the realization of cosmic constancy and consistency.","time":1490415131,"resto":118180228,"id":"zMT3NNXO","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118183767,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)00:12:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118180228\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118180228<\/a>","filename":"1486952578982","ext":".jpg","w":400,"h":261,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":81,"tim":1490415142617,"time":1490415142,"md5":"6FC7BLWxzMFtR+y1TRMpWw==","fsize":51884,"resto":118180228,"id":"KCqvGYe3","country":"MX","country_name":"Mexico"},{"no":118183821,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)00:12:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118182733\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118182733<\/a><br>I dont think theres anything out there I believe we were put on this planet to make the best of our lives and then die and be remembered.

Mortal man views even his physical environment from the mind level, from the perspective of its psychological registry. It is not, therefore, strange that man should place a highly unified interpretation upon the universe and then seek to identify this energy unity of his science with the spirit unity of his religious experience. Mind is unity; mortal consciousness lives on the mind level and perceives the universal realities through the eyes of the mind endowment. The mind perspective will not yield the existential unity of the source of reality, the First Source and Center, but it can and sometime will portray to man the experiential synthesis of energy, mind, and spirit in and as the Supreme Being. But mind can never succeed in this unification of the diversity of reality unless such mind is firmly aware of material things, intellectual meanings, and spiritual values; only in the harmony of the triunity of functional reality is there unity, and only in unity is there the personality satisfaction of the realization of cosmic constancy and consistency.","time":1490415131,"resto":118180228,"id":"zMT3NNXO","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118183767,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)00:12:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118180228\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118180228<\/a>","filename":"1486952578982","ext":".jpg","w":400,"h":261,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":81,"tim":1490415142617,"time":1490415142,"md5":"6FC7BLWxzMFtR+y1TRMpWw==","fsize":51884,"resto":118180228,"id":"KCqvGYe3","country":"MX","country_name":"Mexico"},{"no":118183821,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)00:12:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118182733\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118182733<\/a><br>I dont think theres anything out there I believe we were put on this planet to make the best of our lives and then die and be remembered.

The big bang was not the beginning of the universe, at least not as far as we can figure. When physicists say time &quot;began&quot; at the big bang, all they&#039;re saying is that their current theories (general relativity) could not describe time before that. I know that kind of has the fingerprints of divine intervention, but to a real scientist all it implies is an incomplete theory. <br><br>The popular conception of the big bang is VERY wrong, or at least, VERY biased towards a certain point of view that is not at all certain. They say things like space and time were &quot;created&quot; by the BB, but that&#039;s at best very misleading and at worst an attempt to connect science to current popular conceptions of God.<br><br>They use grandiose ways of describing things, like saying that space is constantly being &quot;created&quot; by the BB&#039;s shock wave, and I can kinda, sorta see why they say that, but all it really means is that for materials moving away from your local reference point at a certain speed, those materials are permanently out of your reach. They&#039;re moving away at the maximum possible speed from you, so you can never catch them. The practical upshot of this is that for those objects, time cannot pass in any local reference frame you can ever reach, so outside of that distance, space &quot;doesn&#039;t exist,&quot; because it&#039;s not really possible for anything to ever happen there-- you see, at the speed of light, all time stops, at least relative to your current reference frame. That&#039;s why they think space is &quot;created,&quot; but within those reference points beyond your event horizon, things progress normally and YOU are the thing stuck in suspended animation. I know this sounds weird, but it&#039;s a weird subject. It all works out because these two reference points are permanently out of reach to each other-- basically, in our universe, you can trade distance for time.<br><br>Sorry if I didn&#039;t explain this very well, I&#039;m really sleepy and it&#039;s past my bed time.","time":1490418069,"resto":118180228,"id":"qJ2IF42e","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118188409,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)01:01:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118188205\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118188205<\/a><br>Did god also determine what kind of god should form to create himself after he created himself?<br><br>Begging the question fallacy.","time":1490418108,"resto":118180228,"id":"3D\/sAIVW","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118188472,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)01:02:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118187298\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118187298<\/a><br>the universe is talking to you all the time. omens, messages, intuition. 21-27 is the normal development of this ability.

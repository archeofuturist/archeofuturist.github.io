I agree with it . But here is what modern Arab philosophers tell us:<br><br>European enlightenment was a reaction to an internal struggle within Europe. A struggle between the church and the state, and the church and science. That&#039;s why the products of enlightenment fit well with European culture. It is its natural progeny.<br><br>On the other hand, since modernity knocked the doors of the middle east with Napoleon&#039;s campaign on Egypt 1789, the middle east &quot; fake&quot; enlightenment was a response to the western challenge. Our struggle that directed the Arab thought in the past 200 years was an external struggle, an obsession of proving ourselves to the west. The result was<br><br>Model 1- Arabian liberals trying to mimic the west<br>Model 2- Arabian Islamist&#039;s reacting to 1 by trying to go back to the roots, that is mimic the early Islam days of the prophet Pbuh and Sahaba<br><br>The problem with the modern Arabian thought is that in both cases it&#039;s about mimicry, while real enlightenment is about genuine ideas, about critical thinking. As Kant defined enlightenment, It is about the mind escaping &quot;self-incurred tutelage&quot;. A mind that mimics hasn&#039;t escaped that . That&#039;s the tragedy of the Arabs and Muslims in the past 200 years. Model 1 is not perfectly applicable &#039;cause it&#039;s the result of a different culture. Model 2 is inapplicable cause it&#039;s a model from 14 centuries ago.","filename":"mz","ext":".jpg","w":1536,"h":1008,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":164,"tim":1490265492055,"time":1490265492,"md5":"igUtzbBUF0Pa46zc1tE0\/w==","fsize":125193,"resto":0,"id":"P0JvQtLI","country":"GB","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-problem-with-islam","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":5,"images":1,"unique_ips":6},{"no":117919991,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)07:16:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117917304\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117917304<\/a><br>tl:dr<br>Nuke Islam","time":1490267766,"resto":117917304,"id":"nG9LvxUW","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":117920327,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)07:21:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117917304\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117917304<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;model 1 and 2<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;the issue with islam is them not being enlightened<\/span><br><br>There is no issue with Islam on their own standing, you bong.

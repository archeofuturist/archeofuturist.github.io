I actually like communism, but must admit it&#039;s contrary to human nature and pure communism in practice can&#039;t work. Human nature needs capitalism to some degree as an outlet for it&#039;s greed and predatory impulses. However, the occasional Stalin type leader isn&#039;t all bad. He dragged Russia out of the medieval mud and into the Industrial Age in a span of 5 years where it would&#039;ve taken others 50.

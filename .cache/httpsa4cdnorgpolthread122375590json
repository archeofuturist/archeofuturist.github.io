Sure, gradual changes make sense for, say teeth, in which harder cells become successively harder, and thus more effective, or slow become more precise points. But for complex systems, like eyes, or flight mechanism, chemical camouflage, or even reproductive organs, gradual mutations seem to be pointless in the short term, generation to generation struggle, and thus would not be chosen to pass on. Survival of the fittest works astoundingly well for shape of animals, but is far less convincing for their systems.","time":1492923949,"resto":122375590,"id":"RcfDwGUF","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122383186,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)01:06:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122382941\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122382941<\/a><br>1.

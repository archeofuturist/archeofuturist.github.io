The EU was originally good in theory as a trading union, I honestly wouldn&#039;t have minded staying in even if it cost us more because Europe should be stronk. Instead Merkel and the rest of the fucking commies started to lust for arab and nigger dicks and invited half the world to enjoy the feast with none of them contributing, only taking us for every penny they can get. Unfortunately as we&#039;re no finding out, the EU was never going to be a trade union to foster goodwill between European countries; it was a totalitarian, authoritian communistic nightmare in the rising with the intent to exterminate and replace the natives of Europe with shitskin serfs.","time":1490790812,"resto":118776045,"id":"QqTHtJlX","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118781143,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)08:33:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"Who else enjoying some aesthetic<br>B R E X I T W A V E <br>right now?<br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=QHL<wbr>taMD7EHM","filename":"Nigel-Farage","ext":".jpg","w":564,"h":372,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":82,"tim":1490790835845,"time":1490790835,"md5":"63Xd+sGnyDNbIH9DtMysSQ==","fsize":28136,"resto":118776045,"id":"veQqU9Cj","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118781159,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)08:34:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118776285\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118776285<\/a><br>please pay your nato debnts to TRUMP","time":1490790847,"resto":118776045,"id":"nrpzi5Te","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118781190,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)08:34:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118777008\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118777008<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;pay debts<\/span><br><br>You owe us 300billion, Hans","filename":"1490656814516","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":1024,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490790870754,"time":1490790870,"md5":"JtY7hZIZ4al1kRkb\/KsUNw==","fsize":298400,"resto":118776045,"id":"kodsWi1K","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118781289,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)08:35:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118777915\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118777915<\/a><br><br>inflation has gone into the triple digits and people still don&#039;t wake up ( Hello Venezuela )","time":1490790938,"resto":118776045,"id":"sh\/rc7D6","country":"CL","country_name":"Chile"},{"no":118781295,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)08:35:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118776635\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118776635<\/a><br>F","time":1490790941,"resto":118776045,"id":"nGXuTZoP","country":"CH","country_name":"Switzerland"},{"no":118781319,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)08:35:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"Post yfw the EU is nothing more than a currency manipulation racket for German bankers.","filename":"texan_nationalism_on_the_rise?","ext":".jpg","w":850,"h":709,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":104,"tim":1490790954888,"time":1490790954,"md5":"XKmxtAjXk8+6CuRj46HhTQ==","fsize":48691,"resto":118776045,"id":"nrpzi5Te","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118781320,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)08:35:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118778546\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118778546<\/a><br>lol no","time":1490790955,"resto":118776045,"id":"RpK58fJZ","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118781336,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)08:36:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"I&#039;m an EU national who has lived here for 12 years now.

Why are we told its ok and normal to be gay when that simply isn&#039;t true...because its a DISORDER? Why are gays rallying for &#039;gay rights&#039; which only serves to further normalize their DISORDER? If gays really cared about homosexuality beyond serving a liberal Jewish agenda, they&#039;d be rallying for funding and research into finding a genetic cure. But they don&#039;t. And that&#039;s why they will all hang on the Day of the Rope.","filename":"gay stats","ext":".jpg","w":3099,"h":1854,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":149,"tim":1491344667304,"time":1491344667,"md5":"mZ9VVXYLT93i7zz340mlhg==","fsize":802200,"resto":0,"id":"yAa7k977","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"lets-talk-about-homosexuality","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":1,"unique_ips":2},{"no":119527180,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)18:33:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"Join the OFFICIAL \/polgb\/ Discord:<br><br>https:\/\/discord.gg\/u67FU","filename":"polgb12","ext":".png","w":297,"h":276,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":116,"tim":1491345208371,"time":1491345208,"md5":"V1QoIq3jZ7fH8QSXPRv+Cg==","fsize":89886,"resto":119526049,"id":"isaSkdE9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

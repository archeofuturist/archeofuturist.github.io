One can learn that he is a seventh-generation descendant of dynasty founder Mayer Amschel, and that as the great-grandson of &quot;the Benefactor&quot; he controls the Caesarea Edmond Benjamin de Rothschild Foundation. The foundation, through the management of the Caesarea community, provides financial support for education in Israel and has land and cash holdings worth more than NIS 700 million. Googling also reveals that the baron controls private banks in France and Switzerland, owns a number of the world&#039;s most famous palaces and wineries and is very fond of sports, particularly sailing. He rarely gives interviews; there are a handful of articles about him in the French press but none in the English-language media and certainly not in the Israeli media.<br><br>We were on the way to interview Baron Benjamin de Rothschild, the last scion of the dynasty&#039;s French branch, who is considered the world&#039;s richest Rothschild today.<br><br>http:\/\/www.haaretz.com\/israel-news\/<wbr>family-values-1.323094","time":1491420892,"resto":119644726,"id":"e9\/eCunA","country":"CH","country_name":"Switzerland"},{"no":119645140,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)15:35:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"why is rich people so ugly?","time":1491420923,"resto":119644726,"id":"9zR47K2z","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":119645377,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)15:37:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119644880\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119644880<\/a><br><a href=\"#p119644843\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119644843<\/a><br><a href=\"#p119644790\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119644790<\/a><br><a href=\"#p119644726\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119644726<\/a><br><br><br>Where&#039;s the gas when you need it...","time":1491421042,"resto":119644726,"id":"ms7Vq2Bj","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":119645706,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)15:40:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"I wonder what that place smelled like","time":1491421214,"resto":119644726,"id":"HUCyugm0","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119646137,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)15:43:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119645140\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119645140<\/a><br>(((they))) inbred","filename":"1489165553637","ext":".jpg","w":736,"h":607,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":103,"tim":1491421436297,"time":1491421436,"md5":"gWgYc2ItfgiPXSmgAAeVJg==","fsize":103571,"resto":119644726,"id":"VMMYXNYm","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":119646190,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)15:44:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119645140\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119645140<\/a><br>Generations of kike sibling interbreeding.","time":1491421460,"resto":119644726,"id":"9qjs2e9u","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119646263,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)15:44:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;no frito chili bar<\/span><br><br>plebs","filename":"worlds_largest_fritos_chili_pie","ext":".jpg","w":700,"h":467,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1491421499619,"time":1491421499,"md5":"XhTjufQGxhVwnZhfWlBi\/A==","fsize":94245,"resto":119644726,"id":"7pt2mcRa","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

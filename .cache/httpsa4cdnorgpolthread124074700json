Its no coincidence the same Satanists who rape and eat children, run your government, and don&#039;t want you to explore antheogenic compounds. You&#039;re right, its degenerate, but if you give an institution of authority the ability to dictate whether or not you can put something into your body, you&#039;ll be full on 1984 in about a hundred years.

They were at least at intelligent as modern humans but lived in much smaller societies. They first left Africa ~250,000 y.a. and interbred with later homo sapiens who left Africa ~75,000 y.a. <br><br>All populations contain some Neandertal admixture EXCEPT for Sub-Saharan Africans. They contain no Neanderthal DNA and more &quot;archaic hominid&quot; aka homo heidelbergensis or homo erectus, our 2 basal ancestors. <br><br>To further confuse the situation, Australian Aboriginals are so distantly related to all living humans (and least related to Sub-Saharan Africans) that they are all but considered a separate species. Also, there is an extinct group of hominid species called homo denisovan that only interbred with Melanesian (Oceanic Islander) peoples. <br><br>So modern humans are actually 4 distinct sub-species of the genus homo: <br><br>1. Homo sapiens sapiens (modern Sub-Saharan African) <br>2. Homo sapiens eurasia (modern Eurasians. 3-4% Neanderthal admixture) <br>3. Modern Melanesian (3-5% Denisovan admixture)<br>4. Australian Aboriginals. <br><br>This information is clear as day in the modern (post Neanderthal gene sequencing c.a. 2010) literature but has not made it to the public because of the implications.","filename":"humanevohistory","ext":".png","w":567,"h":417,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":183,"tim":1490232654074,"time":1490232654,"md5":"QdZCBcYM1CEJzfYkpl9+sA==","fsize":29435,"resto":0,"id":"FQEwZvgE","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-4-subspecies-of-homo-sapiens","country_name":"United States","replies":7,"images":1,"unique_ips":3},{"no":117866820,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)21:44:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117865001\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117865001<\/a><br><br>Good luck convincing neo-liberal academia of this one","filename":"1414902575816","ext":".png","w":882,"h":797,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":112,"tim":1490233483600,"time":1490233483,"md5":"LWlajW0ME1tRxyxzu30CXw==","fsize":131913,"resto":117865001,"id":"tos\/5IDJ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117867326,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)21:48:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"If I&#039;m not mistaken, Abos are actually a subgroup of mongoloids that split off fairly early, so Mongoloids are a separate subspecies from Europeans.","time":1490233703,"resto":117865001,"id":"ZFYgItci","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117867350,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)21:48:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117866820\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117866820<\/a><br> This is the *unspoken* accepted view in anthropology.

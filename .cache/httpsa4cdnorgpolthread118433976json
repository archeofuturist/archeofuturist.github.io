Capital is a critique of Classical capitalism with some Hegelian Dialectical Historical Materialism thrown in, while Capitalism in its Classical and the Neoclassical form (which was in a way a critique of Marx&#039;s critique of Classical economics, the capitalists needed to reject classical economics because Marx had used it to critique capitalism) implicitly assumes that happiness is measured in utils, and is confined to the material. It is only in the vague new world of behavioral economics that we are starting to view man as he is, as opposed to homo economicus. <br><br>There are no economic outcomes that can be justified by economics itself. The judgement of economic outcomes must always be the conclusion of some external moral axioms, whether they be political or spiritual. The political must proceed the economic. Marxian and Capitalist ideologies believe that their systems are superior because they make people wealthier. In these two systems, political action is always in the service of the economic outcomes, for example: elimination of tariffs to make markets freer, or wage and price controls. It&#039;s a question of whether that prior ideology uses economics to serve a non materialistic end or a material one.<br><br><a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/118419781#p118434169\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118434169<\/a><br>In these systems everything is reducible to matter. Once you go below matter there is infinite emptiness, they have reached the lowest metaphysical point. Heidegger and Guenon argued this also and their views on it are more articulate than mine, but they argued that the West must go through this age of nihilism and materialism before people can once again face their own being.

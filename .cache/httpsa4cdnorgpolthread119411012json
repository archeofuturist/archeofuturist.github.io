In the US legal system, a law is required to make something illegal.<br>2. Without an underlying statute to bring charges against an individual or company, their actions are not illegal.<br>3. If something is not forbidden by law, it is necessarily permitted by law under the US legal system. Therefore, if something is not illegal, it is legal.<br>4. No law existed directly regulating which data an ISP may collect or sell to private companies.<br>5. ISPs own all data transmitted over their network.<br>6. The only laws which apply to ISPs are general laws on collecting and selling data, such as not releasing classified information. These are the same laws which apply to any handling classified information or other information which is illegal to share.<br>7. Your internet browsing habits are not classified and has never been illegal to share.<br>8. Google, Facebook, and your ISP may all collect and share your browsing habits because no law exists saying they may not.<br>9. The FCC sought to make it illegal for ISPs to sell certain data transmitted over their network.<br>10. Congress overrode the desires of the FCC, striking down the regulation they sought to enact.<br>11.

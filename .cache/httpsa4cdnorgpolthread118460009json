It does seem like something that has been blown out of proportion, but it is very real. <br>I&#039;ll just share my experience and what I think about gays. I got raped by my stepdads friend when I was 6 and did some gay shit with my step brother when I was 7. The first few times he forced me with violence and threats, the last few times I did it willingly (mostly due to fear of violence). The time with the old guy (he was in the Navy, go figure) I remember everything leading up to it. He rubbed my back, then my belly, then I either fell asleep or completely blocked it out. I&#039;ve tried so hard to remember what happened and can&#039;t. The only reason I even know it happened was all the weird apologies and presents he bought me and the fact that my step bros say it happened to them, too. I remember everything that happened with my step bro. I feel like the stuff with my bro was more like innocent adolescent exploration, and the other time was the real life changing, fuck me up mentally situation. I have never done anything with a man besides those 2. I did let girls put stuff up my ass, in a few relationships. Large things, almost coke can sized things. I have realized how disgusting that is and the only reason I allowed it or got any joy out of it was due to that terrible expeience with the old Navy fag. I don&#039;t think being gay is biological at all, it is learned. <br>Sorry for the essay.","filename":"tmp_30506-14900920293711324456627","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":640,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490586178718,"time":1490586178,"md5":"DX66o5b0lbf42Gkhwu3Yxw==","fsize":56583,"resto":118460009,"id":"kqTNSfhc","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118466477,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)23:43:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118461625\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118461625<\/a><br>Definitely seems like there&#039;s reasonable correlation.

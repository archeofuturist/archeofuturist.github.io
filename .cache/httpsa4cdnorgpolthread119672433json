I have been pretty happy with him so far, but if he goes to war, hes just another shill for Israel, like Obama and Bush. Im hoping that he won&#039;t, but its possible he will. <br><br>Maybe Keks message was this:<br>Kek is the god of chaos and &quot;raiser up of the light&quot; right? Kek brought in a new era, a new age. Trump was destined to win this election, but maybe his purpose was a little different that we originally thought. He brought in a new era in American politics, he showed us we can win an election. But he is not going to solve all the problems in this country. After Trump, we need to keep working, and find someone better than Trump, that will truly end the globalist bullshit. Trump is just the begining. <br><br>And before I am called a (((shill))), realize that I am just worried that Trump might shill out for the globalists and (((foreign interests))), sending good American men to die for them, while destroying another middle eastern country that was fairly stable before our (((politicians))) fucked it all up by arming the FSA. This is the kind of shit that if he does, it will tear apart his core supporters.","filename":"IMG_2742","ext":".jpg","w":980,"h":457,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":116,"tim":1491434605367,"time":1491434605,"md5":"XadkeKy3XLy+iuzJRqmb\/g==","fsize":211567,"resto":0,"id":"IJ0yWV7Q","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"i-am-very-worried-about-trump-guys","country_name":"United States","replies":45,"images":8,"unique_ips":29},{"no":119672525,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)19:24:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"Tl:dr","time":1491434658,"resto":119672433,"id":"t\/2mrBZx","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119672613,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)19:25:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119672433\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119672433<\/a><br>Syria comes after North Korea buddy.","time":1491434709,"resto":119672433,"id":"xFqAC5j7","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119672664,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)19:25:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"Maybe we should have realized when he kept shilling for Israel.

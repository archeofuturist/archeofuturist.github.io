A glacial melt reservoir just as spectacular as Yosemite. But it was flooded when a dam was built to harvest electricity for Roosavelt&#039;s make-work infrastructure program. A unique, irreplaceable natural environment ruined forever.","filename":"tide pool","ext":".jpg","w":800,"h":574,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":179,"tim":1492145339794,"time":1492145339,"md5":"NaB\/0A43gGkKku6VRKfIMg==","fsize":314514,"resto":0,"id":"jbALrTzx","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"why-do-right-wingers-seem-to-hate","country_name":"United States","replies":12,"images":3,"unique_ips":11},{"no":121020239,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)00:51:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"Right-wing pro-environmentalist here.<br>Fuck those righties who do not want to protect our surroundings.","time":1492145490,"resto":121019975,"id":"ksjvZomQ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121020298,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)00:51:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121019975\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121019975<\/a><br>Awww boo hoo the earth is sad suck my dick faggot I&#039;m gonna dig holes and not fill them in just to spite you","time":1492145519,"resto":121019975,"id":"QalMdTkp","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121020352,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)00:52:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121019975\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121019975<\/a><br>I am pro conservation in regards to natural areas, man can work in harmony with nature.","filename":"foragreenfuture","ext":".jpg","w":644,"h":435,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":84,"tim":1492145547020,"time":1492145547,"md5":"gSjK6aGnhx5B1oqoSTPfmw==","fsize":28022,"resto":121019975,"id":"U\/5WqvKh","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121020360,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)00:52:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121019975\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121019975<\/a><br>Right\/Left is honestly kind of stupid and artificially confines just normally viewing things.

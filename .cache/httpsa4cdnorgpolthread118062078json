Unlike many fine and noble users of this site I don&#039;t actually believe that rabid, unchecked whorishness is the natural state of women without men standing over them threatening violence. I think that the debasement of our culture is responsible for this. And if it could be pushed one way it can be pushed another. <br><br>Speaking purely hypothetically, we&#039;d need to seize the government to make this happen though. No more &#039;music&#039; videos which are just excuses to display shaking asses and pounding noise, make divorces difficult as fuck and unfavourable towards women (unfair but they simply initiate most divorce, likely because it currently favours them so much). No more kids learning about pozzing and condom use when they&#039;re 8 years old. No fucking tv&#039;s or ipads in their faces all day. We&#039;re going full blown Rousseau\/Illich here. We&#039;re going to have to rewire the human brain from birth up. Current generations can&#039;t be saved.<br><br>So in other words if you didn&#039;t realize, I think the cause is absolutely 110% fucked and could only be fixed by a god among men.<br><br><a href=\"#p118072163\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118072163<\/a><br>I don&#039;t think you understand the point at all. Throwing out the terms &#039;marriage&#039; and &#039;divorce&#039; won&#039;t solve anything. I&#039;m concerned with the purely practical impacts of the cheapening of marriage. High divorce rates annihilate social capital and stunt the upbringing of our youth.

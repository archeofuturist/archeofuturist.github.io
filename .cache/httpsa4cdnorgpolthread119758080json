All my friends who are German or have German parents have told me that when the subject of History was taught in their classes that they were taught the horrors of the holocaust and stuff and how it was their fault. While I believe that such a horror should never be forgotten, is it right of the German Government to make the children feel ashamed for something their Grandparents\/Great Grandparents did?<br><br>Like, if that&#039;s the case why don&#039;t the Americans do the same thing about the Trail of Tears, Slavery, Segregation, and basically everything else? So I have a question for yall today.<br><br>Should the German Government do what the Americans do - acknowledge the mistakes of the past, but not dwell on it?<br>Like, understand that times were different and people did things that we today find atrocious? <br><br>And before anyone says anything about the Holocaust, ignore that for a moment because according to my mother, a native born German, they were also taught about the other acts committed by the German Government during WW2, so you can leave that at the door.","filename":"Flag_of_Germany.svg","ext":".png","w":1280,"h":768,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":150,"tim":1491495409144,"time":1491495409,"md5":"qEQYLlEYYxCPiW9DJV6sog==","fsize":4078,"resto":0,"id":"0DQJ5mti","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"should-germany-halt-its-guiltbased-history","country_name":"United States","replies":21,"images":1,"unique_ips":13},{"no":119759674,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)12:30:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119758080\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119758080<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Should Germany halt it&#039;s Guilt-Based History?<\/span><br>No. Germany has a pathological since Reformation a pathological culture and they are rightly, for the time being, ashamed of it.

fight against the government.[33] As of December 2016 the village near the dam, Al-Thawrah, is occupied by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. In 2013, four of the dam&#039;s eight turbines were operational and the original staff continued to manage the dam. Workers at the dam still received pay from the Syrian Government and fighting in the area temporarily ceased if repairs were needed.[34] January of 2017 saw a raid against ISIS by combined SDF and US special forces between the dam and nearby Al-Thawrah.[35] The dam was taken by the SDF with assistance from US forces in March 2017.

The former accuse national-anarchists of being white nationalists who promote ethnic and racial separatism, while the latter argue they want the militant chic of calling themselves &quot;anarchists&quot; without the historical and philosophical baggage that accompanies such a claim","time":1493877288,"resto":124025942,"id":"Di7Fitpf","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124027077,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)01:55:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124025942\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124025942<\/a><br>Natsoc still sounds better","time":1493877343,"resto":124025942,"id":"Di7Fitpf","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

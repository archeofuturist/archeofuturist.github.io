I have been a visitor in Germany for over 50 years and, during the 1960&#039;s I had several opportunities to speak with both former military and high political leaders from the National Socialist period. In most of my interviews I asked the same question which you have put forth and here is what I usually received for an answer;<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;First, Fascism is based on a core belief of anti-liberalism and anti-communism and is very nationalist. Sounds like National Socialism-- right? The main difference is that the NS movement goes a step further and blames these philosophy&#039;s and all the other ills of the world on the Jews. Fascism is basically not anti-jewish and as a matter of fact had many Jewish members, including the grand Rabbi of Rome! Additionally, while they believe in the ideal of superior leaders rising to the top of government, Fascism is not racist.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Second; in the area of economics Fascism is based on more of a traditional form of socialism whereas National Socialism rejects traditional socialism as being just another Jewish swindle. The main difference is that Fascism is more rooted in an economic form of government while the NS movement is based on race and the folk community. While there clearly were socialist elements in the Third Reich these are actually closer to what we today have in America, with things like old age pensions and public health care. I have been repeatedly told that National Socialism uses any economic element that will benefit the people of their nation and is neither a left wing nor a right wing movement.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Anyway, I hope that all of this is as clear as mud!!<\/span><br><br><br>https:\/\/www.stormfront.org\/forum\/t8<wbr>83982\/<br><br>Right from Stormfront and some guy who talked to actual High Ranking German Nazi Officials.<br><br>All you wanker wiener boys, don&#039;t know shit.","filename":"article-2604389-0B569A9D00000578-273_306x459","ext":".jpg","w":306,"h":459,"tn_w":83,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492188494199,"time":1492188494,"md5":"MbHmyKjSBsHA3oJtXhdAGg==","fsize":33328,"resto":121069281,"id":"FVE+4WM8","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121082125,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)12:49:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121081605\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121081605<\/a><br>This.

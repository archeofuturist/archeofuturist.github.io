Everybody else is pissy little princesses who think they deserve everything.<br><br>You do favors for \/r\/the_donald, they don&#039;t even say fucking &quot;thanks&quot;. And still they feel like you should continue doing things for them. It&#039;s like you&#039;ve never been around people before, though I guess I shouldn&#039;t be surprised.

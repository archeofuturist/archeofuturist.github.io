They are all trending too high.<br><br>* In the late 1990&#039;s the modelers themselves stated that if they missed their predictions for more then a decade that would falsify AGW theory.<br><br>* There is no data to suggest a +H2O feedback either now or in Earth&#039;s past.<br><br>* If there is no +H2O feedback then we literally have nothing to worry about.<br><br>* The average climate change believer knows none of this.

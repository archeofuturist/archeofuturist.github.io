As they wait they&#039;re building alliances with tribal leaders and building an army with a unified command and ideology. <br>I can&#039;t find much info on them as most attention is placed on ISIS but, I believe they&#039;re building their forces for a potential attack against the Iraqi government. <br>Their main figurehead is an old Saddam era general, al-Douri but, most of their leader are post-saddam military officers who have become experts in paramilitary warfare from a decade of constant warfare. I even heard that they&#039;re trying to recruit amongst all walks of life portraying themselves as secular and anti-sectarian by trying to gain kurdish and Shia allies. <br>Information is hard to come by with most of my info coming from Wikipedia. <br><br>What do you think \/pol\/? <br>Are the Ba&#039;athist a spend force or do they have the potential of becoming major players once ISIS teters out?","filename":"images (2)","ext":".jpg","w":184,"h":274,"tn_w":167,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491699633675,"time":1491699633,"md5":"em4svDkHuPExhrD3TXOITA==","fsize":8131,"resto":0,"id":"o7d2EqiK","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"baathist-resurgence","country_name":"United States","replies":9,"images":1,"unique_ips":4},{"no":120212508,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)21:03:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"Are Bathists still secular Arab nationalists?

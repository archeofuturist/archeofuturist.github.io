My grandfather was one of the chief military figures in developing the neutron bomb in the 50s and early 60s. He went to graduate school for nuclear physics, and they put him on as the military officer in charge of the project (I think we was either a Lt. Colonel or a full Colonel at the time, strangely enough as an armored officer). His team basically brought Cohen&#039;s theories to life as the first generation of high radiation\/low yield thermonuclear devices. Basically, neutron bombs are useful because we can&#039;t just drop a hydrogen bomb on all of our problems. Sometimes you want to go nuclear to show your serious without going top shelf with a 10 megaton device. The neutron bomb solves this by lacking the tamper (usually made of non-reactive U-238) the regular hydrogen bomb does (obviously with other alterations I don&#039;t know about because I&#039;m not a nuclear physics\/don&#039;t have Q clearance with the DOE or TS\/SCI with the DoD). The tamper reflects neutrons back into the reaction of a thermonuclear device causing the reaction to complete more, which means more energy -&gt; a bigger explosion. Without a tamper, the reaction doesn&#039;t reach completion before being blown apart by the energy created, so radioactive isotopes are blown all over the fucking place. Basically, a neutron bomb is kind of like if a dirty bomb fucked a hydrogen bomb and they had a baby.","time":1491632951,"resto":120078458,"id":"HwkKr4+h","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120099307,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)02:34:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120098849\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120098849<\/a><br>interesting. so basically neutron bombs have a smaller explosion and release more radiation?","time":1491633249,"resto":120078458,"id":"SywoAkPs","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120099805,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)02:39:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120098849\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120098849<\/a><br>nice pasta","time":1491633575,"resto":120078458,"id":"U5hFAhp\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120099939,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)02:41:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120078458\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120078458<\/a><br>Cameraman would be dead if that was a Neutron bomb.","time":1491633679,"resto":120078458,"id":"y6faWYdv","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120099950,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)02:41:24","name":"Nathan Bedford Forrest","com":"<a href=\"#p120078458\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120078458<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;no blinding white flash<\/span><br><br>fake and gay<br><br>Also, camera should&#039;ve shorted out from the EMP that close.","filename":"nuke pwnage","ext":".jpg","w":680,"h":497,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":91,"tim":1491633684081,"time":1491633684,"md5":"OICyaCruKHit8GvxDwwjEQ==","fsize":61752,"resto":120078458,"id":"maVjt+I4","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120100132,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)02:43:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120099307\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120099307<\/a><br>Basically.

Similar concept to &quot;dial-a-yield&quot; wherein a nuclear weapon can have multiple yield options depending on how a dial is set prior to them being put inside a missile. Sometimes you want a tactical nuclear strike, not a turn your country into a smoldering pile of rubble strike. One of the more useful things nukes can do (aside from the psychological impacts on the enemy) is knock down anything running on electricity as the radiation released from a nuke is an EMP. However, compared to a pure fission device (think what we dropped on Japan) of equal yield, a neutron bomb will release way more radiation and that neutron radiation ha a much higher average energy level (14 MeV as opposed to 2 MeV of a fission device - yeah I got this from wikipedia, I know a fair amount, but not everything). We have never officially used a neutron bomb, though we could have as it wouldn&#039;t be as easily verifiable as a tampered thermonuclear device. <br><br>Israel does have a boner for neutron bombs, though. It is very very likely that Israel tested one of these bombs in 1984 (though not confirmed).","time":1491633896,"resto":120078458,"id":"HwkKr4+h","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120100330,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)02:45:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120099805\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120099805<\/a><br>Not pasta, google it, friendo.","time":1491633921,"resto":120078458,"id":"HwkKr4+h","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120100535,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)02:47:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120100279\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120100279<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;is knock down anything running on electricity<\/span><br><br>Electronics will not be affected if they are shielded.

That&#039;s only one purpose, the other (well, third) is to theoretically kill the people without killing the infrastructure.

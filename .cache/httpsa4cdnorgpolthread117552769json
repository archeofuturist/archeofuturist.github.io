I&#039;d say women are respected less than men in general, but they aren&#039;t helping anything by being brats about it. If a woman wants respect she has to earn it, that&#039;s just the way it is. <br><br>Other countries are legit fucked though, like saudi women not allowed to go outside with a man present and getting stoned for premarital kissing. That&#039;s where the real problem is, where its a question of human rights as opposed to women&#039;s rights.","time":1490054849,"resto":117552769,"id":"zRkz7Xbk","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

However, they kept getting more and more confrontational and more and more demands started popping up. From who I was allowed to have over to all sorts of extremely bizarre demands. It&#039;s almost like once they get their way unequivocally &quot;they&quot; need to re-establish some kind of friction because their identity is based on smacking their mental disorder of your head and always having it be at the forefront of any interaction.<br>Certainly there are &quot;chill&quot; trannies\/intersex\/trans people who are just as cool as anyone and not trying to be an annoying piece of human-refuse...but they are so few and far between that it almost isn&#039;t worth mentioning.<br>&quot;No community takes on the characteristics of their exceptions.&quot;<br>The reason why *normal* people seem ambivalent, standoffish, uncaring is because we REALLY don&#039;t give a shit.<br>Like people have stated. a .5% (TOPS) population doesn&#039;t get to dictate the entirety of linguistics.

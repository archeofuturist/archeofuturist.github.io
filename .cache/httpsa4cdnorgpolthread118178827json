Classification of Matter<br><br>42:3.1 (471.8) Matter in all universes, excepting in the central universe, is identical. Matter in its physical properties depends on the revolutionary rates of its component members, the number and size of the revolving members, their distance from the nuclear body or the space content of matter, as well as on the presence of certain forces as yet undiscovered on Urantia.<br><br>42:3.2 (471.9) In the varied suns, planets, and space bodies there are ten grand divisions of matter:<br><br>42:3.3 (472.1) 1. Ultimatonic matter \u2014 the prime physical units of material existence, the energy particles which go to make up electrons.<br><br>42:3.4 (472.2) 2. Subelectronic matter \u2014 the explosive and repellent stage of the solar supergases.<br><br>42:3.5 (472.3) 3. Electronic matter \u2014 the electrical stage of material differentiation \u2014 electrons, protons, and various other units entering into the varied constitution of the electronic groups.<br><br>42:3.6 (472.4) 4. Subatomic matter \u2014 matter existing extensively in the interior of the hot suns.<br><br>42:3.7 (472.5) 5.

Ionized matter \u2014 individual atoms stripped of their outer (chemically active) electrons by electrical, thermal, or X-ray activities and by solvents.<br><br>42:3.9 (472.7) 7.

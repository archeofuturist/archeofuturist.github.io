In the criminal complaint, the FBI complainant also categorized the procedure performed by the Michigan doctor as a \u201ccriminal sexual activity.\u201d Reportedly, the DOJ charged Dr. Jumana Nagarwala accordingly.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The affidavit stated supportive evidence that Jumana Nagarwala should be charged with \u201ctransportation with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity\u201d in addition to a charge of \u201cfemale genital mutilation.\u201d According to the FBI agent\u2019s statement, when Nagarwala removed part of the prepuce from young girls\u2019 genitalia, it constituted an illegal sexual act, because one purpose of FGM is to \u201ccurb the sexuality of girls and women.\u201d<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;On one victim, with a coded identity of MN-V-2, the doctor allegedly made a small incision on the victim\u2019s clitoral hood and a small tear to her labia minora. The parents of this victim told Minnesota authorities that they took their daughter to see Dr. Nagarwala for a \u201ccleansing\u201d of extra skin. Another victim, known as MN-V-1, was found to have an altered labia minora and an abnormal-looking clitoral hood. MN-V-1 said that MN-V-1 and MN-V-2 had to go to the doctor because their \u201ctummies hurt\u201d and that the procedure would \u201cget the germs out.\u201d Nagarwala will probably claim that the FGM surgery was not performed to curb the girls\u2019 sexuality, but rather to keep the area cleaner and prevent urinary tract infections.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Sound familiar?<\/span><br><br>cont&#039;d","filename":"3222","ext":".png","w":480,"h":696,"tn_w":172,"tn_h":249,"tim":1492424218298,"time":1492424218,"md5":"FeYTnvt1eq66G4\/yrEMc\/w==","fsize":510835,"resto":0,"id":"hE0JUKCs","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"fbi-complaint-doj-charges-against-fgm-doctor-will","country_name":"United States","replies":4,"images":2,"unique_ips":1},{"no":121509435,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)06:17:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;The agent\u2019s complaint further muddied waters that have already been increasingly muddy. Across the United States, human rights advocates sometimes called \u201cintactivists\u201d have consistently declared that it is unfair that the United States protects girls from genital mutilation, but does not protect boys from circumcision. Generally, the argument has been that female genital mutilation is much crueler than male circumcision, because of the amount of tissue that is removed from girls during procedures completed to abuse girls. Now, we read an FBI agent\u2019s complaint stating that the procedures done to two female victims constitute illegal sexual acts on the part of the doctor, even though the procedures may or may not have been done to prevent urinary tract infections, given the victims\u2019 statements.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Then, Assistant Attorney General Kenneth A. Blanco of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division said that \u201cDr. Nagarwala is alleged to have performed horrifying acts of brutality on the most vulnerable victims,\u201d even though the amount of tissue removed from the victims\u2019 genitals, from the FBI agent\u2019s complaint, was not the entire prepuce as is usually the case with male circumcision.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Dr. Jumana Nagarwala, of Northville, Michigan, allegedly performed these genital mutilation procedures out of a medical office in Livonia, according to KFOR News. Dr. Nagarwala worked in emergency medicine at the Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit. Henry Ford Hospital has placed her on administrative leave and condemned the procedures the doctor allegedly performed.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u201cThe alleged criminal activity did not occur at any Henry Ford facility,\u201d David Olejarz, a spokesman for the Henry Ford Health System, said in an email to the New York Times. \u201cWe would never support or condone anything related to this practice.\u201d<\/span><br><br>cont&#039;d","filename":"8877","ext":".png","w":479,"h":483,"tn_w":123,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492424274813,"time":1492424274,"md5":"oSr7rkbAp1WFIARHghcaVQ==","fsize":290416,"resto":121509371,"id":"hE0JUKCs","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121509632,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)06:20:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Men who wish that their genitals had been left intact are pretty sick of the continual lack of validation by the American medical community, according to an online discussion on the Practical Ethics forum at University of Oxford:<\/span><br><br>\u201cIndeed, Western societies don\u2019t seem to think that \u2018health benefits\u2019 are particularly relevant to the question of whether we should be cutting off parts of the external genitalia of healthy girls. Without the girl\u2019s consent, or a medical diagnosis, it\u2019s seen as impermissible no matter what. By contrast, a small and insistent group of (mostly American) scientists have taken it upon themselves to promote infant male circumcision, by conducting study after well-funded study to determine just what kinds of \u2018health benefits\u2019 might follow from cutting off parts of the penis. Why is there a double standard here?\u201d<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Dr. Jumana Nagarwala might spend her life in prison for performing genital mutilation procedures on girls. She has essentially been accused of criminal sexual activity. If convicted, this case will also lay the foundation for the end of the legal, routine circumcision of infant males. The Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution has a clause guaranteeing all people equal protection of the law. See, Dr. Nagarwala\u2019s case is the very first case using the FGM statute in federal court, according to ABC News.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;If Dr. Nagarwala is convicted, her case will set a precedent that, thanks to gender equality rights, could bring the practice of male circumcision in the United States to a furious, sweeping halt.<\/span><br><br>http:\/\/www.inquisitr.com\/opinion\/41<wbr>44446\/fbi-complaint-doj-charges-aga<wbr>inst-michigan-fgm-doctor-will-end-r<wbr>outine-infant-circumcision-of-males<wbr>\/","filename":"Thornhill protest","ext":".jpg","w":768,"h":526,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":85,"tim":1492424436545,"time":1492424436,"md5":"0Vf4e4aiiZmmg8inXwGL\/Q==","fsize":213572,"resto":121509371,"id":"hE0JUKCs","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121510177,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)06:28:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"bump","time":1492424882,"resto":121509371,"id":"hE0JUKCs","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121511215,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)06:41:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"Going to try bumping again.<br><br>Usually threads about circumcision really take off on \/pol\/.

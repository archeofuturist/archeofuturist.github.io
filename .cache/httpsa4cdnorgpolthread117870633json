Being atheists themselves, they raised me fairly unbiased in terms religion. I grew up in canada, and was surrounded by white friend from kindergarten. Never was a big fan of turkish culture, I grew up like them. Its been 5 years since I got my phd, and i would like to believe i am a functional member of the society. I contributed a lot to canada, and I would not want to that shithole of a country ever again.","filename":"853c69a442b48cfc2cbf7de8210e04b7","ext":".jpg","w":236,"h":185,"tn_w":236,"tn_h":185,"tim":1490235218920,"time":1490235218,"md5":"8F5B5wXMbfuTJajLbFnv4w==","fsize":9880,"resto":0,"id":"4MZVa+QF","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"want-me-to-go","country_name":"Canada","replies":24,"images":1,"unique_ips":17},{"no":117870854,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)22:15:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"is no shrill btw, say yes or no and i will take it as face value","time":1490235311,"resto":117870633,"id":"4MZVa+QF","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":117870930,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)22:15:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"Yes or no to what?","time":1490235339,"resto":117870633,"id":"5r8rV9WE","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117871058,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)22:16:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117870633\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117870633<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Yes goyim, I am most definitely a turk, you should be more accepting of us in your countries<\/span>","filename":"87","ext":".jpg","w":1440,"h":1080,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1490235392529,"time":1490235392,"md5":"Fb2mzCfOooKNwjj1nxLCJg==","fsize":27763,"resto":117870633,"id":"GIDwwW0\/","country":"CA","m_img":1,"country_name":"Canada"},{"no":117871225,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)22:17:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;I contributed a lot to canada<\/span><br>Why don&#039;t you capitalize the name of the country you supposedly appreciate?","time":1490235470,"resto":117870633,"id":"7G7UVgqt","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117871232,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)22:17:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"yes or no to the question whether I should go or not","time":1490235472,"resto":117870633,"id":"4MZVa+QF","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":117871356,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)22:18:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117871225\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117871225<\/a><br>i dont really about spelling here on 4chan, like most people","time":1490235531,"resto":117870633,"id":"4MZVa+QF","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":117871381,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)22:19:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117870633\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117870633<\/a><br>Yeah, fuck off, we are full.","time":1490235543,"resto":117870633,"id":"AqbPsRqJ","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":117871383,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)22:19:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117870633\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117870633<\/a><br>well, once as shitskin...","time":1490235545,"resto":117870633,"id":"Q2gUpK88","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":117871391,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)22:19:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117871232\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117871232<\/a><br><br>how white are you?","time":1490235549,"resto":117870633,"id":"fwQklV1G","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117871627,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)22:20:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"Who cares, don&#039;t listen to the losers on this board. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;my family escaped from turkey long ago due to the government&#039;s over islamic policies and occasional coups.<\/span><br>Good, most of &quot;your&quot; people are just here to leech off of our system","time":1490235658,"resto":117870633,"id":"CaQiSuhh","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":117871657,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)22:21:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117871391\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117871391<\/a><br>skin barely distinguishible from white, but slightly east asian yellow, brown eyes, normal white nose, pink nips","time":1490235671,"resto":117870633,"id":"4MZVa+QF","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":117871792,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)22:22:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117871232\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117871232<\/a><br>Not only should you leave, you should also kill yourself, and not come to the US.<br><a href=\"#p117871356\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117871356<\/a><br>Do you care about anything but yourself, you atheist scoundrel?

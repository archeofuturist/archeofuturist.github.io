Of course not, they make it from capital gains and investment income.<br><br>Of course liberals instituted a remarkable policy known as &quot;social security&quot;. Imagine some guy came up to you and told you he had a remarkable investment. If you gave him 1 dollar today, he&#039;d give you 1 dollar in 50 years. Clearly, this is a horrible deal so you&#039;d tell that guy to go fuck himself. Now imagine if that guy brandished a gun and told you it wasn&#039;t a choice, you have to make this investment. Well, this very scenario is social security in a nutshell.<br><br>Now of course liberals will get angry reading that, &quot;social security is not an investment&quot; they will loudly proclaim. They will state the true purpose of social security is a &quot;safety net&quot; for the downtrodden. However, a &quot;safety net&quot; is not quite what social security is for most people. Now I&#039;m not even talking about disability or unemployment insurance. I&#039;m talking about the social security we all know. Where you pay FICA tax your whole life and then get a pittance once you turn 65. This is completely independent of any &quot;safety net&quot;. In fact, I&#039;d say it&#039;s the exact opposite, it&#039;s an anchor stifling economic mobility for both the working and middle classes.","filename":"social_security_scam","ext":".png","w":2202,"h":3520,"tn_w":156,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492592887398,"time":1492592887,"md5":"LEEJLeFrGL41o8b+NQzPEA==","fsize":1091137,"resto":0,"id":"2PjerBE1","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"why-do-liberals-hate-poor-people","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":121824155,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)05:08:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"The fundamental question I have to ask is, what happens when you die? As the law currently stands if you die at 64, all those social security taxes you pay go poof and no one inherits your benefits. Consider an alternative scenario, where a person was mandated to invest in the stock market (such as S&amp;P500). They would have $500,000 to their name. Now what happens if they die? Their progeny get that $500,000. This can be spent on anything, including further investments. Look at image attached, observe what happens if that $500,000 is put into a high dividend yield ETF. Simply living off the dividends by the age of 80 that $500,000 grows to $3,300,000. What happens when they die now? Their progeny inherits over 3 million dollars.<br><br>Social security is the most regressive policy in the history of America, yet liberals will never admit this nor will leftists. This is because they don&#039;t want the poor to know how much money they&#039;ve been denied all this time. They rather point at the rich as if the rich are the ones who created this abhorrent policy.","time":1492592898,"resto":121824139,"id":"2PjerBE1","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121827213,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)05:51:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"Bumping for quality thread","time":1492595507,"resto":121824139,"id":"DfARo0cm","country":"CY","country_name":"Cyprus"}]}

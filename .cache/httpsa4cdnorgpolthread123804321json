His strength came in the form of furious supporters who thought their votes might finally mean something. I voted for the first time, but once he got into office, there was a different feeling. Obamacare lite was obnoxious, then he attacked the freedom caucus, which was basically his core supporters, then proceeded to suck paul ryan&#039;s dick about how wonderful he was, and then as soon as i heard about the strike on Syria, i said he wouldn&#039;t get reelected. <br><br>Trump worked because he was going to do what republicans promised, but never followed through with. I seriously think he&#039;ll be remembered as one of the worst, if not the worst, presidents we&#039;ve ever had. Not because he actually is (he&#039;s just being a standard cuckservative fag), but because of the weariness of the country. He exposed so much corruption, red pilled so many people, and then showed them how blue pilled he and kushner are. Most of the election, he had some sort of strategy. Now it&#039;s like he&#039;s just flailing around. He was clearly trying to oust bannon, and only pulled back once breitbart shit all over him for it. <br><br>He made the same mistake every republican does.

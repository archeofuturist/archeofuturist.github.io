Yet the three biggest components of this process are unreliable. The hypothesis is a blatant assumption. The thesis is a conclusion reached by committing countless consequential fallacies. Peer review is subject to human error and the bandwagoning phenomenon. <br><br>With all of these discrepancies in the scientific process, how can it be considered viable?<br><br>Scientists argue that science works based on &quot;evidence.&quot; This evidence is, in and of itself, cherrypicked to suit the thesis. Scientists and those supporting them laud science for its apparent ability to predict and simplify phenomena into models. Yet, this very simplification is evidence for science&#039;s uncredibility. <br><br>The universe seems so simple when explained by science, as it did when explained by faith before it. This simplicity is irrational. Indeed, the more complex science becomes, the more orderly and human the universe seems to be, hinting at the fact that science simply echoes the human paradigm back at us. <br><br>How, then, is science more than another faith?","filename":"51LPdav3AYL._SX330_BO1,204,203,200_","ext":".jpg","w":332,"h":499,"tn_w":166,"tn_h":249,"tim":1493064261417,"time":1493064261,"md5":"RDZk2STrdbp8F39gnnHDUg==","fsize":39707,"resto":0,"id":"tvT1c7c\/","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"science-is-bullshit","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":122630937,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)16:11:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"Science is the reason we have antibiotics and modern medicine.

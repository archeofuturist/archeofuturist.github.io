They should be there in time for the 15th on Kimmy-go-Crazy day<br><br>2.This air travel distance is equal to 1,629 miles. The air travel (bird fly) shortest distance between South Korea and Philippines is 2,621 km= 1,629 miles. If you travel with an airplane (which has average speed of 560 miles) from South Korea to Philippines, It takes 2.91 hours to arrive.<br><br>Instead of the gas turbines or diesel-electric systems used for propulsion on many modern warships, the carriers use two A4W pressurized water reactors which drive four propeller shafts and can produce a maximum speed of over 30 knots (56 km\/h) and maximum power of around 260,000 shp (190 MW).<br><br>with 3 days at 24 hours a day they&#039;d have to be pulling 22.625 KPH (knots, not km) to make it there in said 3 days, as the bird flies. North Korea is further than South Korea, obviously, plus there&#039;s time involved in where the ships were. The Philippines are a long vertical island chain. It would take longer for them to shove off from port, an entire day is scheduled for suck a maneuver by the books to get an air craft carrier out of dock into open sea. If they were off the southern horn of the Philippines they&#039;d also be much further away and have further to steam.<br><br>3.

We tracked the plane and Syria doesn&#039;t deny it was their plane. They claim that there were chemical weapons at the target, but that explanation doesn&#039;t make sense because it was clearly an air burst. It&#039;s unlikely that Assad ordered this, because it would be fucking stupid, but it WAS syrian air craft. Either due to miscommunication, a mixup in the loading bay, insubordination, or treason. Whoever was responsible was likely left at al-Shayrat to get blown up by the missiles.<br><br>But additionally, as has been stated numerous times, this does not represent a change on the position of the white house towards assad.

I&#039;ll probably never need to pay for an abortion because I&#039;m careful. I never needed one in the previous 42 years because I&#039;m careful. I don&#039;t care which freedom is being discussed, we don&#039;t need more loss of any freedom. Abortion is on the table today, so there are a ton of fags here with their fascist views about forcing everyone to adhere to their religious beliefs. Fuck your religious beliefs or love of little unformed babies. If you don&#039;t like it, don&#039;t do it. I&#039;ve never argued against people&#039;s rights to not get abortions and be happy about it, but if even one person is forced to have a child they never wanted because somebody else&#039;s sky fairy says no, and they convinced others to make it a crime, that is unjust. Do whichever one you want, but keep your ideology to yourself. Abortion should be legal. It literally hurts no one who will even realize they are alive. They don&#039;t. Neither did you until you were like five. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;inb4 personal experiences, &quot;I knew&quot; or &quot;nuh-uh.&quot; I don&#039;t care what you think you knew when you were a fetus; you didn&#039;t know shit.<\/span><br><br>You&#039;re putting words in my mouth.","time":1493675946,"resto":123651073,"id":"hr356YJg","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123679795,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)17:59:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123678922\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123678922<\/a><br>Sounds like the abortionists need to catch up.","time":1493675991,"resto":123651073,"id":"hr356YJg","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123680696,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)18:07:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123679703\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123679703<\/a><br>Autocorrect got me on the last sentence.

What&#039;s not being talked about is what&#039;s causing the population of poor people to be increased in non-sustainable environments where only a small group of people can be self-sustained at one time.<br>There is something in the works, because in the long run this is going to cost countries billions of dollars to keep up, and the cost will continue unless the problem is addressed.<br><br>There are those at the top (controllers, like Rothschilds) who tell their puppets below (politicians\/media\/etc, like Merkel) what they want to happen and the spin that they need to have.<br>Now I believe there is an agenda, and that within the agenda there are smaller items (push porn, destroy the meaning of gender, push fake equality), and some items are more specific and talked about less. In this instance, population control of one of the fastest growing continental populations of the world, Africa. Also the poorest. <br>I believe that the EU, UN, and US politicians (through TPP) were planning on doing many things, but one item on their agenda was them trying to crashing the world economy in order to control the population of Africa. It can be inferred because even the ideologies of the United Nations is eugenics in the name of making progress (see Julian Huxley&#039;s writing in UNESCO, page 12 reference h ttp:\/\/unesdoc.unesco.org\/images\/000<wbr>6\/000681\/068197eo.pdf).<br><br>If you look at the population of Africa overtime, it has only recently begun to increase, before, it was assumed that it was stable. Not going up nor down, now the damn charts look like somebody has been providing Viagra over there. Is there a problem with this? &quot;Shouldn&#039;t we treat them humanly?&quot;","filename":"1490391594537","ext":".jpg","w":599,"h":389,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":162,"tim":1491198816247,"time":1491198816,"md5":"bNUqeaTayM8TFTOoA3S1Zw==","fsize":41374,"resto":0,"id":"geeSFjyb","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"warning-to-africa-population-will-decline","country_name":"United States","replies":6,"images":4,"unique_ips":3},{"no":119297432,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)01:54:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"Yes. And yes.<br><br>To address the first, problem is that these trends of are *dangerously* propped up because of one variable. Humanitarian intervention. At the turn of the 1900s, western civilization began importing their technology, which *naturally* increased birth rates. Just like in any other instance in history.<br><br>But people saw that they were still living in terrible circumstances. And that they would have children there lived terribly because there was no structure\/civilization (as we know it, libs will tell you mud huts are civilization all day with their degree in sex and Ph.D. in Oral Sex). So the west helped them.<br><br>This is the problem. Once people began giving aid to African countries, that&#039;s when the increase in population trends went from natural and self-sustaining, to *artificial* or you could say subsidized. See page 7 in this study, and you&#039;ll clearly see that around the 1950s, there is a huge increase in population. Soon after the UN was established (h ttp:\/\/mortenjerven.com\/wp-content\/u<wbr>ploads\/2013\/04\/AfricanPopulation.Me<wbr>thods.pdf)<br><br>Now just like how in the US, you subsidize poorer people to have kids, you have more poor kids. It&#039;s the same thing in many places in Africa. People would have kids in Africa, mainly because they don&#039;t practice unprotected sex and didn&#039;t care, but now with all the free gibbs me&#039;s that foreign countries are giving to Africa, the population feels like they are entitled to keep getting free stuff from foregin countries, which creates a lot of apathy for trying to improve their countries or be heavily supportive or invested in their governments (which is possibly one of the many reasons for there a high rate of conflict in Africa).","filename":"1490402398492","ext":".jpg","w":1315,"h":1820,"tn_w":90,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491198880601,"time":1491198880,"md5":"4Al8tIML26J3jEgT8a7nww==","fsize":2971926,"resto":119297331,"id":"geeSFjyb","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":119297487,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)01:55:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;mfw global superbug wipes out the human race<\/span>","filename":"1398952776020","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":338,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1491198922782,"time":1491198922,"md5":"nyf6\/wB5ORiSfWykeH4r+Q==","fsize":56075,"resto":119297331,"id":"LbGIdjUh","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119297516,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)01:55:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"Now the second point, what about treating them humanly anon?

Then after they killed off enough they would&#039;ve rallied the world together to try and save the people of Africa.<br>They needed pretty much every rich country to be in a treaty where we were all tied together, you can compare it to the housing crisis around ten years ago. We would&#039;ve all collapse around the same time, leaving Africa to implode on itself once the aid was cut and their artificial population self-regulated to where it was stable.<br><br>But I disagree with their methodologies, it&#039;s like what a passive agressive dick would do if they screwed up, and instead of trying to fix the problem in a way that helps both people they screwed, they decide to through one person under the bus even though it is the passive agressive person&#039;s fault the other was in that situation. Such a pussy move.<br>I think they should just tell the African governments that aid and funding will not be increased anymore unless it is used to further the education (benefits of protected sex, and self-sufficient famring tecniques, etc) of the African people, so they don&#039;t need to leach off of society to just barely scrape by. What are your thoughts on this? There&#039;s no way they&#039;re going to be able to continue to sustain the ever growing poor population of Africa. Either through viruses or economic reasons, they&#039;re going to try dropping those poor people without really caring.","filename":"1489043145212","ext":".png","w":688,"h":578,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":105,"tim":1491199025198,"time":1491199025,"md5":"2EkAabnRDD9p2wStWAEcsg==","fsize":32427,"resto":119297331,"id":"geeSFjyb","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119297706,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)01:57:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119297331\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119297331<\/a><br>Africa is fairly cut off from the world economy.

Sanders is running on an unabashedly socialist platform: he is promising nationalized healthcare and the most massive tax raises in the history of the United States. He&#039;s not talking about taxing the &quot;rich&quot;; in fact, I highly doubt he is anything but the best of friends with the rich, just like the original Bolsheviks were. The benign coverage he is receiving in the globalist owned media is a proof of that.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Rather, his tax plan revolves around utterly destroying W2 wages. He is completely blatant about it, to the point of bragging. If you make 100k, Sanders is going to increase the federal taxes you pay by 50%. If you make 200k, you will give more than 50c of every additional dollar you make to the federal government under his plan. ********* In other words, Sanders&#039; tax plan is a government enforced caste system: either you are already rich today, or you will never make anything of yourself because the government is going to take any money you try to earn above what is &quot;proper&quot; for you to have. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;This is not a prediction or a hypothesis. This is where we are right now. The year 2016 has shown us that the United States is already a walking corpse. The globalists have picked off the choicest morsels over the last few decades, and now the socialist hyenas are about to pounce and tear apart the rotting remains. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Another thing this shows us is that a very high percentage of young people, those under 30, have been completely indoctrinated by leftist, liberal philosophy and ideology in today&#039;s colleges. They are ignorant of how economies work and operate and have no basic understanding of economic principles. What Sanders advocates would lead to a major economic collapse of the entire United States economy.<\/span>","time":1492650014,"resto":121923219,"id":"\/PAFc+Jg","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121927139,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)21:01:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121923219\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121923219<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;that mug<\/span><br><br>He&#039;s looking more and more like lucky Larry Silverstein.

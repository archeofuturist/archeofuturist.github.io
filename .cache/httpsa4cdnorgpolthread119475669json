I surf this godforsaken\/&#039;enlightening&#039; board every day and have decided that now is the time to get married. It&#039;s a big, big step, and I think I&#039;ve found the right girl. Mostly importantly, I think marriage is a huge part of my western values, and I want to do everything in my power to preserve and protect this tradition of sanctity. I need your advice, however.<br><br>1. I&#039;m spending \u00a33000 on a ring that retails at \u00a35000, I&#039;ve managed to get in contact with a wholesaler through a work colleague (the CFO) and so I&#039;ve saved a shit tonne of cash.<br><br>2. Her father is a well off banker, has a \u00a32,000,000 pound house in Surrey and she is his only daughter. I have to impress him.<br><br>3. I&#039;m only on \u00a325,000 a year.<br><br>Is this a stupid idea? I can afford it, but I&#039;m going to be pretty broke for 2 months.<br><br>On a plus side, I&#039;ve told loads of women at work about my plans (I&#039;m taking her to Rome in 2 weeks) and they&#039;re impressed. Upon thought, I believe that an engagement ring shows two things: my dick works and i have a bit of cash, however not as much as the cost of the ring may suggest.

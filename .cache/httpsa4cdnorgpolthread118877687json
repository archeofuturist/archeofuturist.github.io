This they don&#039;t understand and it will be the greatest shock for them, of course.<br><br>The demoralization process in the United States is basically completed already for the last 25 years. Actually, it&#039;s over fulfilled because demoralization now reaches such areas where not even Comrade Andropov and all his experts would even dream of such tremendous success. Most of it is done by Americans to Americans thanks to lack of moral standards. As I mentioned before, exposure to true information does not matter anymore. A person who was demoralized is unable to assess true information. The facts tell nothing to him, even if I shower him with information, with authentic proof, with documents and pictures. ...he will refuse to believe it.... That&#039;s the tragedy of the situation of demoralization.","filename":"1483281115253","ext":".jpg","w":400,"h":400,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490880744654,"time":1490880744,"md5":"fQycNk6Xtg7JH98HOpwY1A==","fsize":93600,"resto":118877687,"id":"q01Y9d\/0","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":118921173,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)09:39:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"I thought for some time they would lay off the PC programming because it is creating white nationalists at a furious pace.

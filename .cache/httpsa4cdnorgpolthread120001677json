Teal car owners would say that they don&#039;t have to pay the tax, and many people with darker cars would argue that their car is more black and blue so the law doesn&#039;t apply to them. In order to do something like this the government would instead have to say all blue cars from which the light is between 450\u2013495 nm have to pay 5% more tax. The term blue is meaningless and the statement would just as valid if they didn&#039;t use the term &#039;blue&#039; at all but only stated exactly what wavelengths they were concerned about.<br>Likewise using racial terms is pointless in non casual contexts since their definitions are arbitrary and instead more precise definitions should be used (eg over x percent of melanin).","time":1491592771,"resto":120001677,"id":"ftMlTEnZ","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120006692,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)15:20:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120001677\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120001677<\/a>","filename":"soon","ext":".jpg","w":191,"h":245,"tn_w":97,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491592842546,"time":1491592842,"md5":"xoyiHGYuBu++0HLmOmY1cw==","fsize":16570,"resto":120001677,"id":"82AatadO","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":120007058,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)15:23:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120006520\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120006520<\/a><br>Everything is a social construct so nothing matters.<br><br>Sure thing ahmed.<br><br>If race isn&#039;t real why are liberals obsessed with it?","time":1491592981,"resto":120001677,"id":"IF3TJIDC","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120007094,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)15:23:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"All communist must die, and one day, we will kill you too.","time":1491592991,"resto":120001677,"id":"AQC6Kj+6","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":120007146,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)15:23:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120006094\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120006094<\/a><br>Correct.

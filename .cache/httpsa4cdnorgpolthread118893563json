No, of course you&#039;re not, because you&#039;re stupid enough to believe that Trump and Bush are from the same cadre of Republicans, when in reality, Trump ended the Bush dynasty. The &quot;20 intelligence agencies&quot; is a fucking joke as well, considering that the US created like 5 immediately after 9\/11, but I figured you were too far on the spectrum to get it.

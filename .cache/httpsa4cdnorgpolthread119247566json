It is a growing problem and has been for a long time. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I am convinced that the growing impoverishment of symbols has meaning. It is a development that has an inner consistency. Everything that we thought about, and that has therefore been deprived of a meaningful connection with our developing consciousness, has got lost. If we now try to cover our nakedness with the gorgeous trappings of the East, as the theosophists do, we would be playing our own history false. A man does not sing down to beggary only to pose afterwards as an Indian potentate. It seems to me that it would be far better stoutly to avow our spiritual poverty, our symbollesness, instead of feigning a legacy to which we are not the legitimate heirs at all. We are, surely, the rightful heirs of Christian symbolism, but somehow we have squandered this heritage. We have let the house our fathers built fall into decay, and now we try to break into Oriental palaces that our fathers never knew. Anyone who has lost the historical symbols and cannot be satisfied with substitutes is certainly in a very difficult position today: before him there ways the void, and he turns away from it in horror.

If a man was violent toward his wife, she could divorce him and take the kids, but she had to prove this violence. No-fault divorce removed this burden of proof condition, but kept the divorce-rape. So, a more subtle step would be to reintroduce this burden of proof. A woman, in order to receive any kind of compensation from her husband, would need to prove that he was violent.

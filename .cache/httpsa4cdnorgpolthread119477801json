ADHD medication prevents dopamine reuptake by blocking the dopamine transporter. This causes more dopamine to be available to neurotransmitters for usage. This takes the ADHD individual&#039;s low dopamine levels and elevates them to a normal\/healthy level (if they dose is right, of course).<br><br>A person with low dopamine will have many issues with focus and critical thinking. This is because dopamine is a critical reward chemical that promotes particular kinds of behavior, such as focusing and accomplishing tasks. With a reduced amount of dopamine, such activities become less rewarding, and thus the individual is less inclined to do those activities. This phenomenon leads to all other aspects of ADHD that are observed, such as hyper focus on particular things. Hyper focus is due to the individual finding some stimuli that is great enough for them to produce enough dopamine to remain interested. Because of the lack of dopamine released by most other stimuli, the stimuli that actually produces more dopamine is greatly pursued by the individual in order to continue getting the reward the stimuli offers. That&#039;s why people with ADHD latch on to particular things so strongly.<br><br>The effects of ADHD are very negative to the individual, as they greatly stunt the individuals ability to pursue rational thought. ADHD in children prevents the development of the necessary neuropathways for critical thinking and focus, and once brain development slows, developing those pathways becomes a very difficult task. That is why medicating children with ADHD is important and shouldn&#039;t be looked down on. Otherwise, those children will forever be stunted in regards to their rational abilities, compared to what they would have been capable of had they been medicated. <br><br>The benefits of ADHD medication can&#039;t be overstated. They are miracle drugs for those with ADHD. However, doctors greatly overprescribe them.","time":1491319799,"resto":119477801,"id":"Pho7M8LI","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119480228,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)11:31:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119479826\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119479826<\/a><br>example: i found some code library wich i taught was amazing and i barely slept for a week being busy with that all day long and actually being very productive. <br><br>other example: spend 3 hours observing a birdsnest outside my window for no goddamn reason","time":1491319869,"resto":119477801,"id":"dozWtXT7","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":119480255,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)11:31:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119478097\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119478097<\/a><br>Only have minor OCD when I&#039;m on my meds, Adderall. haven&#039;t taken it in a few years.

Thousands of people are diagnosed with ADHD simply because doctors and parents are too lazy to discipline their children. These children don&#039;t have the structural differences that make ADHD medication necessary, therefore medicating them is pointless and dangerous. When a person who doesn&#039;t have ADHD is medicated for ADHD, they receive far too much dopamine. This leads to numerous behavioral issues that manifest later in life, such as anger and depression issues. Likewise, because their dopamine transmitters are working in overdrive thanks to the excess amount of dopamine, they are experiencing oxidative stress that places a major burden on their neurotransmitters. This can lead to permanent damage if not protected against by antioxidants such as magnesium. Children without ADHD that are medicated for ADHD are highly susceptible to brain damage. Thankfully, young minds are best able to repair brain damage.

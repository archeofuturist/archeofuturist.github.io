Then, a period of class struggle follows in which the capitalist class is liquidated by the working class. When the capitalist class has been completely vanquished, there will be only one class, the working class, and eventually the functions of the state will become indistinguishable from the functions of the society as a whole, and the state as such will &#039;wither away&#039; as Marx said.<\/span><br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/ma<wbr>rx\/works\/1847\/11\/prin-com.htm<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/ma<wbr>rx\/works\/1848\/communist-manifesto\/<br><br>ML uses a philosophy called dialectical materialism, see here:<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/reference\/<wbr>archive\/stalin\/works\/1938\/09.htm<br><br>It is recommended that you read some of the critical works of Marxism-Leninism so you can make an informed assessment of the ideology.<br><br>Resources:<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/ma<wbr>rx\/works\/sw\/<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/le<wbr>nin\/works\/sw\/<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/reference\/<wbr>archive\/stalin\/works\/decades-index.<wbr>htm<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/reference\/<wbr>archive\/mao\/selected-works\/<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/ma<wbr>rx\/works\/1884\/origin-family\/<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/le<wbr>nin\/works\/1914\/mar\/11.htm","filename":"1481244074852","ext":".png","w":1010,"h":1010,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492047773888,"time":1492047773,"md5":"676S1nirnOI5InkeibSxFw==","fsize":177742,"resto":0,"id":"MZ2hNFkz","country":"ES","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"pol-communism-general","country_name":"Spain","replies":14,"images":4,"unique_ips":8},{"no":120849551,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)21:58:03","name":"Anonymous","filename":"1491098820635","ext":".jpg","w":720,"h":493,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":85,"tim":1492048683758,"time":1492048683,"md5":"wwpe6a3KqJOO3XFBeqZ\/GA==","fsize":131995,"resto":120847486,"id":"MZ2hNFkz","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":120849736,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)21:59:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120847486\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120847486<\/a><br>What is the difference between AnCap and communism?","time":1492048755,"resto":120847486,"id":"CjrBGdYJ","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":120850273,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)22:03:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120849736\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120849736<\/a><br><br>Communism is classless and moneyless,on the other hand it is also stateless like ancap.

In this respect communism is differentiated from socialism, which, out of economic necessity, restricts access to articles of consumption and services based on one&#039;s contribution.<br><br>In further contrast to previous economic systems, communism would be characterized by the holding of natural resources and the means of production in common as opposed to them being privately owned (as in the case of capitalism) or owned by public or cooperative organizations that similarly restricts their access (as in the case of socialism). In this sense, communism involves the &quot;negation of property&quot; insofar as there would be little economic rationale for exclusive control over production assets in an environment of material abundance.<br><br>The fully developed communist economic system is postulated to develop from a preceding socialist system. Marx held the view that socialism\u2014a system based on social ownership of the means of production\u2014would enable progress toward the development of fully developed communism by further advancing productive technology. Under socialism, with its increasing levels of automation, an increasing proportion of goods would be distributed freely.","time":1492049928,"resto":120847486,"id":"MZ2hNFkz","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":120852296,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)22:19:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120852168\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120852168<\/a><br>So if a little white bunny eats a lettuce, we got a big pile of lettuce?","time":1492049993,"resto":120847486,"id":"CjrBGdYJ","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":120852516,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)22:21:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120851683\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120851683<\/a><br>\u043de \u0434o\u0432o\u0434","filename":"IMG_006","ext":".png","w":1926,"h":3138,"tn_w":76,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492050106187,"time":1492050106,"md5":"IizVOdA36WmRTKuliyh4Gw==","fsize":299025,"resto":120847486,"id":"BTwJGvHZ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120852521,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)22:21:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120852168\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120852168<\/a><br>Wasn&#039;t that supposed to happen over 100 years ago?

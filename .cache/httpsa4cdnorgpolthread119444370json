That difference will lead to feeling of superiority is, however, another matter entirely. Right now, both you and I understand ourselves to be different from one another, and yet I trust you do not see yourself as being superior to me, and I can tell you I do not see myself as being superior to you. (You must be one of those unfortunate not so Muslim person living in the KSA.)<br><br>To try to abolish hierarchies by trying to abolish difference is, I believe, one of the primary characteristic of the current left, who believes that Hierarchies = Oppression and that Differences inevitably lead to hierarchies and modes of exclusion. One the other hand, I believe that the characteristic of all right leaning movement is their unproblematic relationship with some version or another of the concept of self affirmation.<br><br>Even the libertarian is characterized as a person who recognizes the value of the affirmation of the Self conceived of in and individualistic manner. The individual has an identity and a legitimate right to exclude others from his property and the product of his labor. If hierarchies arises as a result of this affirmation, the libertarian does not have a problem with it. For him, income inequalities are fine as long as they arose according to an individualistic process of free exchange. But the leftist HATES these inequalities, these hierarchies, and cares nothing for the way in which they were created. To him, they are manifestation of modes of oppression.","time":1491314326,"resto":119444370,"id":"Gjw8jk3L","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]}

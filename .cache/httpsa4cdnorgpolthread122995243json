What I notice is that the left was played by 4 people out in the open and the right was played by 2 ppl out in the open, <br><br>The left: you were played by, Soros, Podesta, Obama and Clinton. My reason is the hype they caused amongst their constituents and the moves made to create an illegitimate president out of Trump, as corrupt as they are, he won due to the electoral colleges such were put in place by the left. <br><br>The right: Unfortunately Trump is being a magician and magicians love the art of distraction, your country and mine are both run by the Fed. Reserve. If Trump wasn&#039;t a puppet he would seek reform instead of utilising an archaic system of power. What&#039;s to come will be more inhumane than before.

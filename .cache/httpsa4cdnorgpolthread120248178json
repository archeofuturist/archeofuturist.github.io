He then took the Christology from Arian Christianity, took it to its obvious logical conclusion (hence why it was determined to be heretical at the Council of Nicaea) that there could be other prophets after Christ if Christ was not of a divine nature (which, it should be worth saying, contradicts everything about Christ&#039;s life). Mohammed then said that HE was the real prophet and ripped the backstory of Christianity (this is where muslims invented the idea of &quot;Abrahamic religions,&quot; to give themselves more legitimacy), along with adding in some cultural practices of 7th century Arabia (4 wives? why not 3 or 5? Answer: common practice in Arabia at the time, no divine or moral reasoning behind it) and making exceptions for himself so that he could enjoy the benefits of his conquests (Mohammed himself did not limit the number of wives he was allowed to take, and took at least 11). <br><br>Mohammed then created a political system in which one could only gain upward social mobility (or avoid complete poverty) by converting to his invented religion. Thus, instead of giving old societies life like Christianity had done (through its bottom-up conversions), it sucked the vitality out of the peoples of the caliphates, to the point that all inventions or innovations that came out of the peoples of the caliphates were from the recently-conquered peoples who had still not islamised. This rot eventually consumed the life of the arab peoples, and since then they&#039;ve been under a succession of Turkish and Christian conquerors, starting with the Seljuks. Today, they&#039;re nothing more than the vassals of the Americans and the Israelis.<br><br>Muslims are totally ineffectual and are a long-defeated people, and they only grow in numbers in the West because of our own moral decadence.","filename":"145951795110","ext":".jpg","w":1600,"h":943,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":73,"tim":1491720463603,"time":1491720463,"md5":"g6Iq16eD7OOeOIGSctLt6A==","fsize":234518,"resto":120248178,"id":"LoATWayG","country":"CA","m_img":1,"country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120251657,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)02:47:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120248178\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120248178<\/a><br>I dont give a fuck about the terminology in your goatfucker&#039;s desert stories: pedo edition.

This includes the September 11 attacks which killed 2,996 people, the Madrid train bombings which killed 191, the Norwegian massacre which killed 77 and the London bombings which killed 56. However, it is important to compare these significant events with the more persistent and severe impacts of terrorism occurring in the rest of the world. <br>Attacks in Western countries accounted for a small percentage incidents, representing 4.4 per cent of terrorist incidents and 2.6 per cent of deaths over the last 15 years. The four large attacks listed above make up 91 per cent of deaths from terrorism in the West during this period.&quot;<br><br>Now with the November 2015 Paris attacks killing 130 and the 2016 Nice attack resulting in the death of 86 people and the Orlando shooting which killed 49 all of which were perpetrated by Isis or a lone wolf inspired by them. Adding these to the equation will definitely increase that 91%. The staggering fact is 6\/7 of the most deadliest terrorist attacks in the west involved radical Islamic extremists.","time":1491724807,"resto":120248178,"id":"WsUIhSNn","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120257167,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)04:00:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120256860\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120256860<\/a><br><br><a href=\"#p120256882\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120256882<\/a><br><br>Wouldn&#039;t it just be easier to admit you were talking out your ass about 600,000 being killed?<br><br>All you need to know about the Islamophobic crackpot Bill Warner:<br><br>mohsenaelguindy wordpress com\/2015\/07\/07\/bill-warner-a-notori<wbr>ous-islamophobe-hate-monger-lying-a<wbr>bout-islam\/","time":1491724833,"resto":120248178,"id":"YqKyugxn","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":120257168,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)04:00:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120256718\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120256718<\/a><br>how do you go through life worshiping a guy that sucked dicks and fucked men?<br><br>Maybe if he was a good person, but this sandnigger went aroung looting and raping and killing anything he could get his pig hands on","time":1491724833,"resto":120248178,"id":"cWvbiKER","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120257224,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)04:01:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120248540\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120248540<\/a><br>That&#039;s Wahhabism.

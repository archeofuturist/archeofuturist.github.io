There was some Greek neo-nazis who travelled out to Syria and formed a brigade around 2013 but I don&#039;t know what came of them or if they still exist any more. They fought well at al-Qusayr though and earned a lot of praise at the time.<br><br>There&#039;s Russian volunteer mercenaries fighting out there but I&#039;m surprised there&#039;s been no effort to form a proper international volunteer regiment to promote fighting globalism and Islamic extremism on the actual frontline against it. There&#039;s plenty of potential recruits among anti-globalists, anti-Zionists and ethno-nationalists all over Europe and the West that are sympathetic to Assad and his historic friendship with the latter, it just needs some effort on organising and co-ordinating such a group.","time":1491910321,"resto":120583826,"id":"VHuOiXAB","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120586836,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)07:32:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120586743\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120586743<\/a>","filename":"14c","ext":".jpg","w":207,"h":253,"tn_w":102,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491910322613,"time":1491910322,"md5":"FpoPwkA4ATmqHVKSn9wBUA==","fsize":17304,"resto":120583826,"id":"1Fnyoz1u","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":120586878,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)07:32:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120584745\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120584745<\/a><br>Time works against G7<br><br>-other countries make capital investments to increase productivity<br>-native population in developed countries continues to age, jews do not let the youth to breathe<br>-debts in g7 increase, other countries buy gold.<br><br>So warmongers instead of dealing with cause of problem try to ruin another countries.

Our two children were born here but my wife and I have decided we no longer want to raise our boys in the city (for obvious reasons). We have bought a nice comfy little starter home back in the small town I grew up and met my wife in. The only problem is we can&#039;t agree on which school to send our oldest to. He goes to kindergarten in Sept. <br><br>The town itself is majority white, I can think of maybe of handful of asains and few black kids from when I was living there and it hasn&#039;t changed all that much. Anyways my wife wants to put our son into a christian school. The classes are small and it has a really great record within the community for high achieving. There are no entrance fees for people living in the intimidate area, which we are. I&#039;m just not sure I want my kids to learn based on religion. It seems.....muslim tier.<br><br>The other option is public school. The christian school only goes to grade 9 so they&#039;ll have to go to public high school anyways. <br><br>Any input would be appreciated.","filename":"children-playing-on-grass_1098-504","ext":".jpg","w":626,"h":417,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1490368808837,"time":1490368808,"md5":"pWjJav17r+QURU0i7tyJdg==","fsize":96195,"resto":0,"id":"FOXSOOKn","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"ok-pol-parents","country_name":"Canada","replies":9,"images":1,"unique_ips":6},{"no":118090962,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)11:24:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"bump","time":1490369052,"resto":118090558,"id":"FOXSOOKn","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118091065,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)11:25:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"If it is only for Kindergarten surely you can cope with it for a short while?

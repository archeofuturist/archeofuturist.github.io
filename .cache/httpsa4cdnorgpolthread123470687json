It&#039;s 2007 in the Algave, and you&#039;re Gon\u00e7alo Amaral, the ageing Chief of Police in some tiny little municipality in southern Portugal. Portim\u00e3o has a population of 55k, you&#039;ve probably have to deal with a major case about once a decade. And suddenly this huge, international criminal investigation lands in your lap. Great if you&#039;re ambitious, but if you&#039;re sitting out the final years of your career in some little tourist resort rather than pushing for a promotion to somewhere like Lisbon, it&#039;s safe to say you&#039;re not ambitious. Or competent.<br><br>So you have this case which you are totally unequipped to handle, and you&#039;re under an intense amount of pressure to find a solution. You tried to pin it on a random British-Portuguese man, but that fell through. People are starting to ask awkward questions about how you&#039;ve handled the investigation. What do you do?<br><br>You blame the closest people to hand. The parents. That way, it&#039;s not your fault that you didn&#039;t find the kidnapper because there never was a kidnapper.<br><br>The first newspaper to suggest that the McCann&#039;s were suspects was the Portuguese publication &#039;Sol&#039;. They had the mobile numbers of several of the witnesses, so it was clear they were being fed information from inside the enquiry. So then the question is, who working on the investigation had a motive to slur the parents of the disappeared girl and create suspicion around them?<br><br>Given that at this point Gon\u00e7alo Amaral has literally started blaming MI5 for covering up the disappearance, I don&#039;t think it&#039;s hard to see how the McCann&#039;s ended up as suspects. Or, for that matter, why the investigation into Madeline&#039;s disappearance wasn&#039;t a success.","time":1493561299,"resto":123470687,"id":"CbpAaawj","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123481289,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)10:14:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123480763\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123480763<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;t.

Neither border nor marine police were given descriptions of Madeleine for many hours, and officers did not make house-to-house searches.[72][73] According to Kate, roadblocks were first put in place at 10 the next morning.[58] Police did not request motorway surveillance pictures of vehicles leaving Praia da Luz that night, or of the road between Lagos and Vila Real de Santo Ant\u00f3nio on the Spanish border. Euroscut, the company that monitors the road, said they were not approached for information.[74] It took Interpol five days to issue a global missing-person alert<\/span><br>Not everyone in the resort at the time was interviewed; holidaymakers later contacted the British police to say no one had spoken to them.[73] The crime scene was not secured. Police took samples from Madeleine&#039;s bedroom, which were sent to three forensic labs in Portugal. It was reported on 1 June 2007 that DNA from one &quot;stranger&quot; had been found. But around 20 people had entered apartment 5A before it was closed off, according to Chief Inspector Oleg\u00e1rio de Sousa of the Pol\u00edcia Judici\u00e1ria.[75][46] According to Madeleine&#039;s mother, an officer placed tape across the doorway of the children&#039;s bedroom, but left at 3 am without securing the apartment.[67] The Pol\u00edcia Judici\u00e1ria case file, released in 2008, showed that 5A lay empty for a month after the disappearance, then was let out to tourists before being sealed off in August 2007 for more forensic tests.<br><br>The police involved in such a butchered investigation should&#039;ve been fired.","time":1493572402,"resto":123470687,"id":"zjG4Tl94","country":"BO","country_name":"Bolivia"},{"no":123499188,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)13:14:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123498693\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123498693<\/a><br>There is only two sources for that claim and they&#039;re blogs.

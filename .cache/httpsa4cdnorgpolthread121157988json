Even Rome had rebellions and defeat in the farthest reaches of it&#039;s empire, despite being overpowered compared to everyone around them in military strength. People didn&#039;t want to pay taxes for the gluttony of the foreign emperor. It was the foreign German &quot;barbarians&quot; that they failed to conquer (due to the inspiring loyalty of Arminius) that ended up ransacking them as they fell apart. Peoples are different physically, mentally and spiritually, create different cultures, and have different strengths and weaknesses that can&#039;t be universally met without reduction of the accommodation of another people. In the United States, we fight black poverty (caused largely by their measurably lower intelligence, combined with their less measurable temperament and culture) with welfare programs, but the majority of the tax dollars come from whites who are much less likely to use said programs. This is an example of how power must be taken from one group in a multi-ethnic society to accommodate the deficiencies of another group.","filename":"1492187505253","ext":".jpg","w":545,"h":397,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":91,"tim":1492225587865,"time":1492225587,"md5":"E2AlMr+LvmmO4qCylu0jFg==","fsize":257918,"resto":121157988,"id":"VX7Db6Ux","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121159703,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)23:06:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121157988\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121157988<\/a><br><br>Go back to r\/The_zionald.","filename":"1491415021914","ext":".png","w":1330,"h":946,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":88,"tim":1492225601224,"time":1492225601,"md5":"aq\/abJZ5iLzGX\/g7NZbkCw==","fsize":464004,"resto":121157988,"id":"\/cnS6e3x","country":"MX","country_name":"Mexico"},{"no":121159769,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)23:07:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121159027\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121159027<\/a><br>Too easily submersible.

It isn&#039;t today, and there&#039;s no reason to believe it would in the future.<br><br>I would argue that civic nationalism has been the GOP platform since Goldwater. Don&#039;t worry about race, just worry about ideas. How is civic nationalism any different from mainstream conservatism or Reaganism? Basically who cares if the country fills up with Muslims, Mexicans, and Congolese as long as I get to make fun of SJWs or whatever.<br><br>But even then, who really wants to live in that society? Robert Putnam, a liberal professor from Harvard even determined that diversity leads to low trust in society, lowered trust in institutions and even lowered civic participation. People withdraw and no longer participate in public life like they used to. If you don&#039;t believe me, look up his book &quot;Bowling Alone&quot;. <br><br>Culture is largely tied to race. If all the white Americans dropped dead tomorrow and were replaced with Mexicans or Somalis, American culture would change drastically. So if that is the case, why would civic nationalism be any different?<br><br>The only way you would have civic nationalism for any long period of time is by force, kind of like the Afrikaner cultural dominance of South Africa as long as they held the institutions. But if you have &quot;subversives&quot;, then you can lose the culture in an instant. And America is full of these subversives, and it&#039;s not only Jews. You are just setting yourself up for a period of peace followed by another 1960s subversion.","time":1492227316,"resto":121157988,"id":"tJcG7ZQc","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121163350,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)23:35:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"Nothing.

This development, however, shouldn\u2019t distract us from the fact that no prominent politician seems able to set out an attractive and comprehensive plan for helping France reassume its place in the West, which it has been losing since its defeat by Prussia in the War of 1870.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Thus, Le Pen zeroed in on France\u2019s undeniable problem with Islam and terrorism. She also stressed her hostility to the highly unpopular EU. As a consequence (so say the exit polls), something like two-thirds of those voting for Le Pen did so because they enthusiastically support her views on these subjects. By contrast, Macron is simultaneously promising slightly more economic freedom and enhanced state-delivered welfare and employment security. He seeks to blur the contradiction by calling himself \u201cpost-ideological\u201d\u2014perhaps a way of saying that he has no core convictions. <\/span><br><br><a href=\"#p122775369\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122775369<\/a><br>what went wrong?","time":1493149300,"resto":122774746,"id":"mHVtWiyr","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":122776093,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)15:43:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122775854\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122775854<\/a><br>how is van der cuck doing as president?","time":1493149405,"resto":122774746,"id":"mHVtWiyr","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":122776577,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)15:47:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"Voting marine is well hearted but retarded<br>She wont deport mudslims living here and making 10+ children, 5 years later we&#039;ll get socialism again and her economical program is anyway already retarded<br>No amount of democracy could cure this country, we need a full force dictator or a civil war, hence I&#039;ll stay home on the 7th, the quicker it happens the better hopes we have","time":1493149635,"resto":122774746,"id":"lqtTs27r","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":122776654,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)15:47:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122776093\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122776093<\/a><br>The same as the previous ones we had, so he&#039;s not doing anything","time":1493149677,"resto":122774746,"id":"sdyCTBW\/","country":"AT","country_name":"Austria"},{"no":122776905,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)15:50:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122776577\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122776577<\/a><br>She wouldn&#039;t even get to implement her economic program if (as likely) her party fails to win enough seats to get a PM with enough support from the Assembly.<br><br>She&#039;d just change foreign and defense policy and be another check on the power of the EU and uncontrolled immigration.<br><br>Macron might not implement any of his political program either, but won&#039;t help block any globalist mumbojumbo<br><br><a href=\"#p122776654\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122776654<\/a><br>what about the next elections?

One is dissatisfaction with the establishment political parties. This year marks the first time since the beginning of the Fifth Republic that a Gaullist candidate did not reach the second round. Perhaps even more significant is the collapse of the Socialist Party, the electorally successful center-left and left alliance painstakingly assembled by the late Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand. The Socialists fielded Beno\u00eet Hamon, one of the most inept mainstream candidates in a very long time. The party that won the presidency just five years ago received barely 6 percent of the vote.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;A second development worth noting: By my calculation, almost 50 percent of French voters supported parties, of the right or left, that are committed to hard or soft Euroskepticism. It\u2019s unlikely that a majority of French voters will choose \u201cFrexit\u201d in the near future. They know just how much France\u2019s stagnant and overregulated economy is propped up by its closeness to the more dynamic Germany. But Macron\u2019s Europhilia shouldn\u2019t blind us to the reality that one-half of the Paris-Berlin axis, which has been core to the European integration project (even more so in the wake of Brexit), is increasingly unenthusiastic about the European Union. In other words, whatever one thinks of supranational projects, views of European integration now constitute yet another deep fissure in the already fractured French body politic, which once was a driving force for integration.<\/span><br><br><a href=\"#p122779578\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122779578<\/a><br>I mean she has a chance, but it&#039;s very unlikely.","time":1493151296,"resto":122774746,"id":"mHVtWiyr","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"}]}

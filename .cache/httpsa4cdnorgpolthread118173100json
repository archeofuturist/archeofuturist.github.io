During this time, it is argued that 30000 people dissapeared (supposedly most of them were killed), mostly for political reasons (They were in most cases communists).<br><br>Just going to say that:<br><br>1) 30000 people is a false number. The real number is around 8000-9000 people.<br><br>2) In most cases, they DESERVED IT. At least 95% of those people were either communist &quot;partisans&quot; or communist supporters. Fuck Communism, all of them deserved execution.<br><br>This country is fucked beyond salvation thanks to the commies. They are still in charge in the country, and influence the mind of most people (muhhh military is bad, muhhh welfare is bad, muhhh don&#039;t oppress the workers).<br><br>The military goverment was bad because it was:<br><br>1) A puppet of the USA.<br>2) A corrupt goverment.<br>3) A disaster for the economy.<br><br>Other than that, their only mistake was not to kill more commies.","filename":"dictadura-militar-2-pablo-lasansky","ext":".jpg","w":340,"h":340,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490409076108,"time":1490409076,"md5":"P0WEuw5JigQIkOvlcjaK1w==","fsize":24214,"resto":0,"id":"dA0kOCBV","country":"AR","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"argentina-red-pill","country_name":"Argentina","replies":7,"images":0,"unique_ips":5},{"no":118173228,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)22:32:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"I meant to say &quot;muhh welfare is good&quot;.

Missouri fought on both sides of the war. <br><br>Some groups are calling for this monument&#039;s removal, similar to actions taken in Louisiana recently. <br><br>I believe we should remember the past, not whitewash it. Others seem to believe the existence of this memorial is too offensive and taints the wonderful park in which it resides. It is on Confederate Drive; there is also a Union Drive on the other side of the park.","filename":"20170429_172020_HDR~2","ext":".jpg","w":2946,"h":3928,"tn_w":187,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493516409975,"time":1493516409,"md5":"D9K97ZPVXsfp4MU1+gGKjQ==","fsize":1927939,"resto":0,"id":"P6TRSx\/H","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"what-do-you-think-about-the-removaldestruction-of","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":2,"unique_ips":1},{"no":123417600,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)21:40:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"This is the offending text.","filename":"20170429_171841_HDR~2","ext":".jpg","w":2372,"h":3163,"tn_w":93,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493516457020,"time":1493516457,"md5":"reMPG3b+RcX6BBCYYgGbrA==","fsize":1015386,"resto":123417504,"id":"P6TRSx\/H","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":123417662,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)21:41:28","name":"Anonymous","filename":"20170429_171943_HDR~2","ext":".jpg","w":3299,"h":2474,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":93,"tim":1493516488086,"time":1493516488,"md5":"a0XdNAFx3OL\/DywBho4l+g==","fsize":2270720,"resto":123417504,"id":"P6TRSx\/H","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"}]}

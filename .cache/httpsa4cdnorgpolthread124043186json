I expect there are other reasons, like immigrant communities holding on to old customs. But, regardless of how men act or what men do, it is the woman who defines and creates the family unit, and it is her responsibility to avoid dangerous situations for her offspring. If a more violent man can protect offspring better than a less violent man, his genes are spread instead. His sons will start fights in schools, and they will be quick to &quot;defend the honour&quot; of any lonely women, who might see such traits as beneficial. What&#039;s an occasional bashing really worth if it means a whole lifetime of your children being safe from outsiders? It&#039;s worth everything.<br><br>I am not condoning this idea, unlike the people who enter into these kinds of violent relationships every day. Unfortunately I&#039;m one of those *terrible people* that blames both parties - the one who harms and the one who sticks around.<br><br>What&#039;s your opinion?","filename":"9fc21b8311a9901d2db4e140c334e325","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":315,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":131,"tim":1493890669928,"time":1493890669,"md5":"8RGYP3LNgPfvkIFWpZD2CQ==","fsize":29567,"resto":0,"id":"hQIAwTjG","country":"AU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"spousal-abuse","country_name":"Australia","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

The movement has run it&#039;s course and now those clinging to it for dear life do so because it&#039;s ultimately all they have left. <br><br>Without feminism these women would have to be themselves, and they hate themselves, but feminism? Well the media sure loves that.","time":1493213886,"resto":122883241,"id":"1aqagH2Q","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122884447,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)09:41:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"I think it has a lot to do with people not understanding that someone could make up a rape story. <br><br>Most of us wouldn&#039;t make up such a story, so we have a bias that anyone who would accuse someone else of it wouldn&#039;t be lying. Hence we are more likely to believe someone when they tell us they&#039;ve been raped. <br><br>Another side is that without actual evidence it&#039;s incredibly hard to prove. Short of being caught in the act by an uninvolved party, it&#039;s basically her word against his. If the &quot;victim&quot; can tell a convincing tale, and the &quot;suspect&quot; can&#039;t otherwise prove it false without an airtight alibi, most people side with the victim based solely on emotion and the social pressure of not wanting to be &quot;that guy&quot; who doesn&#039;t believe someone JUST IN CASE IT MIGHT BE TRUE. <br><br>there&#039;s probably other factors but they also have to do with society, and wanting to be compassionate.

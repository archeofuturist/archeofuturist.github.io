I believe Jews may have been forced into ghettos or some labor camps, but that this was not nearly as bad as it was portrayed. There may have been one or two camps that were almost as brutal as we are told, but this was the exception. A few of (((them))) may have died from starvation (primarily) or execution (much less common), but as far as actual mass death camps and genocide, I believe that was a campaign to garner sympathy and give (((them))) a scapegoat for the next century or so for any wrong doings. I believe actual numbers for Jews in WW2 were in the low hundred of thousands (around the number of gypsies that died), and could mostly be accounted for with just the natural deaths of all the other European civilians in WW2 due to combat.","filename":"2448098-700x","ext":".jpg","w":700,"h":500,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":178,"tim":1491174888277,"time":1491174888,"md5":"xZ\/\/dHt26hGXv9ND83d50Q==","fsize":41881,"resto":0,"id":"flPIUzGD","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"blue-pill-me-or-red-pill-me","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

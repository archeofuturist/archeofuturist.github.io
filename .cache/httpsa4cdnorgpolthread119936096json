Atheism is in decline worldwide, with the number of atheists falling from 4.5% of the world&#039;s population in 1970 to 2.0% in 2010 and projected to drop to 1.8% by 2020, <br><br>Real surveys and statistics say atheism is on the decline worldwide. Sorry atheists but atheism is not on the rise nor is it winning. It&#039;s still the minority and a declining one at that. <br><br>The Pew Research Center&#039;s statistics show that atheism is expected to continue to decline all the way into 2050 with a continued growth of religion. Other research also shows a huge surge in growth for Christianity in China which is currently the world&#039;s most &quot;atheist&quot; nation because of the atheist communist government suppressing religion, the research suggests that China will soon become the world&#039;s most Christian nation within 15 years. <br><br>This is simply history repeating itself: Christianity prospered in Rome back in the ancient era when it was suppressed and it still grew in the militant atheist soviet Russia when it was suppressed there only a century ago with the majority of Russians today now also identifying as Christian. Just goes to show that atheist suppression of religion still doesn&#039;t stop religion.<br><br>Sources for the legion of whiny \/Redditor\/ fedoras that will no doubt show up it this thread:<br><br>http:\/\/www.pewforum.org\/2015\/04\/02\/<wbr>religious-projections-2010-2050\/<br>http:\/\/www.pewforum.org\/2012\/12\/18\/<wbr>global-religious-landscape-unaffili<wbr>ated\/<br>http:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/news\/wor<wbr>ldnews\/asia\/china\/10776023\/China-on<wbr>-course-to-become-worlds-most-Chris<wbr>tian-nation-within-15-years.html<br>http:\/\/masterrussian.com\/russia\/fac<wbr>ts.htm","filename":"1490142549767","ext":".jpg","w":608,"h":755,"tn_w":201,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491566635829,"time":1491566635,"md5":"gbLQR\/M\/TdWWLU+dYjIA+Q==","fsize":123410,"resto":0,"id":"J0t6yUoi","country":"PL","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"atheism-is-the-fastest-shrinking-religion-in-the","country_name":"Poland","replies":20,"images":1,"unique_ips":16},{"no":119936309,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)08:05:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119936096\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119936096<\/a><br>This picture is photoshopped, they were evangelicals kek","time":1491566744,"resto":119936096,"id":"Ib1oC8Gp","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119936360,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)08:06:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119936096\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119936096<\/a><br>Oh look this thread again.<br><br>kill yourself","time":1491566769,"resto":119936096,"id":"zK3LBJCL","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":119936413,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)08:06:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119936309\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119936309<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;falling for cheap shops<\/span><br>That&#039;s the original, pic circulating on \/pol\/ is the fake one.","time":1491566801,"resto":119936096,"id":"J0t6yUoi","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":119936561,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)08:08:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119936096\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119936096<\/a><br>Atheism isn&#039;t a religion","time":1491566884,"resto":119936096,"id":"vDNUisBt","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119936906,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)08:11:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"My wife is pregnant and i did know that i had a choice of color.","time":1491567082,"resto":119936096,"id":"l5ieJOKl","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119937096,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)08:12:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119936096\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119936096<\/a><br>You realize this is because muslims and buddhists are growing exponentially, correct?","time":1491567173,"resto":119936096,"id":"bbHMg1Su","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119937101,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)08:12:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119936906\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119936906<\/a><br>WHen you are an atheist you don&#039;t get to decide.","time":1491567179,"resto":119936096,"id":"J0t6yUoi","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":119937130,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)08:13:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119937096\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119937096<\/a><br>I mean Hindus","time":1491567192,"resto":119936096,"id":"bbHMg1Su","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119937419,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)08:15:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119936096\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119936096<\/a><br>Who cares? im atheist never used that word before i just don&#039;t believe there is a god.

Their Tactic is called &quot;Black Block&quot; which comes from the stupid &quot;V for Vendetta&quot; Movie. They all dress in black and wear masks so the designated attackers have the &quot;Zebra effect&quot; when they retreat into the rear of their lines. <br><br><br>3. They are given a color designation:<br><br>RED are the ones willing to attack and destroy. YELLOW are the ones that play &quot;Red rover&quot; and block police or pursuers from chasing down the REDs after they strike.<br><br>The BLUEs are the ones tasked to block media and cameras from recording the actions. These little POS think that they&#039;re living &quot;V for Vendetta&quot;. <br><br>!!!!TAKE OUT THE RED\/BLACK FLAG BEARER!!!!!<br>CAPTURE THOSE FLAGS!!!<br><br><br>Grab the flag with one hand, tug it into your chest, with a small razor in the other hand, give it a slash and get out of there. Wear your helmet because you for sure will be getting attacked from behind. They will lose their center of gravity. <br>OR The plain clothes and obvious fattys n chicks are the BLUEs, and if you look just behind them you&#039;ll see the REDs all blacked-out. They try to stay in a tight formation the call &quot;Black bloc&quot;. Lob smoke into their center that will blind their cohesion, then have our Spartans do a Breaveheart charge on their flank or wedge the center. That should cause another route. They try to bolster their lines with &quot;fortified banners&quot;. <br><br><br>&quot;For God and Country!!&quot;","filename":"13248906_999164520202395_876195819_n","ext":".jpg","w":762,"h":399,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":130,"tim":1492820309414,"time":1492820309,"md5":"qLvR2wO8MuwxtMwYZv1EgA==","fsize":31103,"resto":0,"id":"6Y3H7XGl","country":"DE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"antifa-tactics","country_name":"Germany","replies":16,"images":5,"unique_ips":11},{"no":122209045,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)20:27:35","name":"Anonymous","filename":"tmp_9941-1492790846326864741417","ext":".jpg","w":388,"h":443,"tn_w":109,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492820855715,"time":1492820855,"md5":"ml3fqhUj6RoeftUh4rGtbg==","fsize":154192,"resto":122207955,"id":"fCVXxZJs","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122209185,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)20:29:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122207955\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122207955<\/a><br>Bump<br><br>Execute Antifa on sight!","time":1492820942,"resto":122207955,"id":"1d+RRGos","country":"CH","country_name":"Switzerland"},{"no":122209209,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)20:29:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"webm related is a good strategy in dealing with them. isolate, and stomp.<br><br>this is from Berkeley saturday.","filename":"goodnightleftside","ext":".webm","w":1280,"h":720,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1492820954814,"time":1492820954,"md5":"JsWWrdMetwzNfcTUXzd5iQ==","fsize":1937028,"resto":122207955,"id":"az+0HW66","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122209435,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)20:31:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122209209\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122209209<\/a><br>Thats why I posted it.

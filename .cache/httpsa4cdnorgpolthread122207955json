Their Tactic is called &quot;Black Block&quot; which comes from the stupid &quot;V for Vendetta&quot; Movie. They all dress in black and wear masks so the designated attackers have the &quot;Zebra effect&quot; when they retreat into the rear of their lines. <br><br><br>3. They are given a color designation:<br><br>RED are the ones willing to attack and destroy. YELLOW are the ones that play &quot;Red rover&quot; and block police or pursuers from chasing down the REDs after they strike.<br><br>The BLUEs are the ones tasked to block media and cameras from recording the actions. These little POS think that they&#039;re living &quot;V for Vendetta&quot;. <br><br>!!!!TAKE OUT THE RED\/BLACK FLAG BEARER!!!!!<br>CAPTURE THOSE FLAGS!!!<br><br><br>Grab the flag with one hand, tug it into your chest, with a small razor in the other hand, give it a slash and get out of there. Wear your helmet because you for sure will be getting attacked from behind. They will lose their center of gravity. <br>OR The plain clothes and obvious fattys n chicks are the BLUEs, and if you look just behind them you&#039;ll see the REDs all blacked-out. They try to stay in a tight formation the call &quot;Black bloc&quot;. Lob smoke into their center that will blind their cohesion, then have our Spartans do a Breaveheart charge on their flank or wedge the center. That should cause another route.

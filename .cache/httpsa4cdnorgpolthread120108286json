Since he has followed all of the rituals and covenants with the Lord and has essentially done everything that could conceivably be done - he is going to get into Heaven. (&gt;inb4 you can&#039;t know His plan. Stop being autists, this is pure speculation and requires Mr. X to get into Heaven so we can have a dialogue.) <br><br>Mr. X lives a long life, his wife dies before him, and he has only one surving family member - a child who is now in their later years. <br><br>Mr. X goes to Heaven, but back on Earth his child decides that he wants Mr. X&#039;s remains to be vitrified via cryonics. And so it is done. <br><br>60 years pass, all the while Mr. X has been in Heaven. However in the time that has passed, Man has gotten good enough with technology to reverse the process of vitrification and Mr. X is revived back on Earth. <br><br>What happens to Mr. X in Heaven?","filename":"IMG_0510","ext":".jpg","w":2008,"h":1376,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":171,"tim":1491640427210,"time":1491640427,"md5":"q94hOU3vcNJH2hn\/h3Ctsg==","fsize":633936,"resto":0,"id":"VWd6ogQi","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"this-is-a-question-for-all-good-christians-on-pol","country_name":"United States","replies":5,"images":0,"unique_ips":5},{"no":120108502,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)04:37:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120108286\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120108286<\/a><br>Goes back into his body obviously","time":1491640661,"resto":120108286,"id":"wi75GrhW","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120108720,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)04:40:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120108286\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120108286<\/a><br>his body might technically be made alive, but it won&#039;t be ensouled unless God wills it<br><br>u can think of a parallel scenario if the scientists manage to make perfect clones of Mr. X - would there then be many Xs? who would be the real one?<br>Answer: God decides","time":1491640859,"resto":120108286,"id":"RmPqDSzc","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":120108809,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)04:42:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120108502\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120108502<\/a><br><br>Why?

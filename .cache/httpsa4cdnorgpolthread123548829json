The problem is that the amount of data they are taking up is not big enough to accurately predict those massive areas they don&#039;t do collections for. It would be very easy to just hand pick locations of a relatively higher short term temp increase, and the extrapolation would be skewed to show high temperatures. When the people conducting the study know their own work could dictate policy, they have a motivation to get policy makers to act in a very serious way so they cooked up an exaggerated temperature study, hence the reason they didn&#039;t want to turn over the details","time":1493614637,"resto":123548829,"id":"UuvjslGR","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123583209,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)01:25:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123561466\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123561466<\/a><br>Looks like an electoral map of the states Trump won versus outright versus some that were previous blue two election cycles.","filename":"2016en","ext":".png","w":1050,"h":670,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":79,"tim":1493616327097,"time":1493616327,"md5":"a6PTonTc2nlGFtdjdVtGdw==","fsize":85571,"resto":123548829,"id":"O7ofZyj\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

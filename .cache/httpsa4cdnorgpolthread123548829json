For the past week I&#039;ve been obsessing over finding raw data on climate change and its really starting to fuck with me:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;meta data for climate change models is usually only sourced to a handful of actual studies<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;that data doesn&#039;t account for certain thermodynamic changes<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;climatic models can prove trends but not predict future trends because of too many out liners<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;take one sample and its variance is already outside a range of statistical certainty. Calling into question its reliability.<\/span><br><br>To make matters worse. All these Climate scientists only reference each other. Many of them don&#039;t focus on cross discipline to engage variables that they couldn&#039;t explain in the first place. So when they go crazy over a spike in ice core data what they are really saying is that they found an out liner that they can&#039;t explain.<br><br>THEREFORE IT MUST BE CLIMATE CHANGE CAUSED BY HUMANS BECAUSE WE CAN&#039;T FIND THE ANSWER ANYWHERE ELSE<br><br>WTH I thought science was about proving a hypothesis not regression to a mean opinion!!<br><br>Will dump studies if ppl ask.

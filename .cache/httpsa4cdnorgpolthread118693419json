At the height of the British Empire, all people belonging to the Empire were legally &quot;British Subjects&quot; so that no distinction was made between Australians, Englishmen, Indians, etc. Obviously this had to end when globalization allowed the easy movement of large numbers of people. The govt needed to distinguish between British people and &quot;British&quot; people. The fact this distinction exists shows that there is another prior identity on these isles, which we call &quot;Englishness&quot;. Englishness existed long before the idea of &quot;Britain&quot;, in fact many were opposed to the idea of Britain. When James I unified England and Scotland and inscribed on the coinage Ezekiel 37:22 &quot;one king shall be king to them all: and they shall be no more two nations&quot; many English people were outraged, and did not want to belong to this new &quot;British&quot; identity. Just read George Chapman&#039;s Eastward Hoe written in 1605. <br><br>The English are ENGLISH culturally and &quot;British&quot; politically.<br><a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/118682511#p118692776\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118692776<\/a><br>relevant to the above: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=VGH<wbr>KkPtmXRU","time":1490733704,"resto":118693419,"id":"GxwtI2Xn","country":"GB","trip":"!!RTdZyZlKJyM","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118693527,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)16:41:44","name":"Anonymous","filename":"16194914_1224385107652892_4262668525371221760_n","ext":".jpg","w":480,"h":469,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":122,"tim":1490733704983,"time":1490733704,"md5":"NTpzxy\/nWmO8U+2d0+ZZ1A==","fsize":42003,"resto":118693419,"id":"0SwfU1TJ","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118693568,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)16:42:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"Her Majesty","filename":"hmqe2","ext":".jpg","w":320,"h":400,"tn_w":100,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490733721458,"time":1490733721,"md5":"mWKY5IuQ3wlJNnu6CxGNFg==","fsize":15992,"resto":118693419,"id":"u9e6honE","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118693571,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)16:42:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"Have you read any of Hitchens&#039; books?<br>I really enjoyed &quot;The Cameron Delusion&quot; and &quot;The Abolition of Britain&quot;.","time":1490733722,"resto":118693419,"id":"Q3wPrb+k","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118693626,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)16:42:32","name":"Hull\/fag\/","com":"Flashback to the past","filename":"13517608_1171418286212716_2225806321034326294_o","ext":".jpg","w":1920,"h":1080,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1490733752153,"time":1490733752,"md5":"7+t4COJIrgq4I98y71x5zw==","fsize":290797,"resto":118693419,"id":"0SwfU1TJ","country":"GB","m_img":1,"country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118693706,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)16:43:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"Fuck Europe","filename":"1473921085402","ext":".jpg","w":480,"h":360,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1490733790799,"time":1490733790,"md5":"ABw8nu4kIYfm0ne3Xqs+tw==","fsize":12865,"resto":118693419,"id":"jB61BTea","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118693769,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)16:43:41","name":"Hull\/fag\/","filename":"16708286_10155806301682166_8222711734828404528_n","ext":".jpg","w":250,"h":209,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":104,"tim":1490733821422,"time":1490733821,"md5":"tMUa0cwgifa7MV+jlUPCUg==","fsize":8772,"resto":118693419,"id":"0SwfU1TJ","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118693777,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)16:43:43","name":"LordNelson","com":"Thread theme: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=KkC<wbr>hiylPMM8","filename":"p041gkcb","ext":".jpg","w":1200,"h":675,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1490733823008,"time":1490733823,"md5":"JS5J5kUWZIwVsnQs7AbcPw==","fsize":81934,"resto":118693419,"id":"GxwtI2Xn","country":"GB","m_img":1,"trip":"!!RTdZyZlKJyM","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118693809,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)16:44:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"B I G D A V E<br><br>Do you miss him yet?","filename":"David_Cameron_official","ext":".jpg","w":1440,"h":1920,"tn_w":93,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490733840920,"time":1490733840,"md5":"I4XZcwWl+Szrtne4Dwy3sQ==","fsize":1200320,"resto":118693419,"id":"YnHM39mM","country":"GB","m_img":1,"country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118693835,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)16:44:10","name":"Anonymous","filename":"1455974023003","ext":".png","w":1000,"h":667,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1490733850383,"time":1490733850,"md5":"ua02b1kRQzfm+m2p2ItIYQ==","fsize":1079293,"resto":118693419,"id":"2Und64mQ","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118693881,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)16:44:32","name":"Hull\/fag\/","com":"<a href=\"#p118693777\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118693777<\/a><br>I prefer this: <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ST<wbr>353mDWL3Q<\/span>","time":1490733872,"resto":118693419,"id":"0SwfU1TJ","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118693915,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)16:44:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Z7q<wbr>qTxFuSdc<br><br>Speakers Corner is no longer a free speech zone.","time":1490733888,"resto":118693419,"id":"okUU1T0W","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118693946,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)16:45:07","name":"Repatriation or Bust","com":"<a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/118682511#p118691725\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118691725<\/a><br>My opinion is that you must either be of the view that Britishness as a category must be tied to race, therefore only white Britons are British, or if you believe that one can be black or Pakistani and British you must therefore be fine with the idea of white Britons becoming an ethnic minority.<br><br>Any position in between these two polar opposites are logically unsound.

The English have never started from legal axioms and proceeded to the individual case, the individual cases infer the principles of law, this is our system of common law.

Thank Enonce Powell. Despite his later anti-immigration views, whilst he was Health minister in the early 1960s he encouraged a large number of Commonwealth immigrants into the understaffed National Health Service. Prior to this, many non-white immigrants were often obliged to take the jobs that no one else wanted (e.g. street cleansing, night-shift assembly production lines), often paid considerably less than their white counterparts. Powell was vehemently opposed by the Trade Union movement (who feared that immigrants were being used by capitalists to keep wages low by artificially increasing competition for jobs), but there is no doubt that in easing non-white immigrants into what was considered a prestigious form of career, he boosted the confidence of the immigrant population and helped lay the foundations of a future immigrant-descended permanent Afro-Caribbean and Asian middle class in Britain","filename":"IMG_2789","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":743,"tn_w":100,"tn_h":124,"tim":1490734655666,"time":1490734655,"md5":"Nk7jYrSOFYjKzNm8Lz7kYQ==","fsize":276016,"resto":118693419,"id":"jYrew7jm","country":"IL","country_name":"Israel"},{"no":118695471,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)16:57:36","name":"Hull\/fag\/","com":"1\/2","filename":"Pastor-Francis-Bashir-leader-of-the-Royal-Disciple-Church-in-Pakistan-277827","ext":".jpg","w":590,"h":404,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":85,"tim":1490734656678,"time":1490734656,"md5":"agTexwt+iSW+W2JNBUnANg==","fsize":32919,"resto":118693419,"id":"0SwfU1TJ","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118695502,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)16:57:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118695010\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118695010<\/a><br>weed everyday for around 6-7 years (quit recently, clean for a month, hitchens would be proud)<br>cocaine<br>MDMA","time":1490734678,"resto":118693419,"id":"x4FCrPUV","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118695504,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)16:57:59","name":"Hull\/fag\/","com":"2\/2","filename":"Royal-Disciple-Church-goers-with-Ukip-posters-571342","ext":".jpg","w":590,"h":350,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":74,"tim":1490734679089,"time":1490734679,"md5":"9YhS\/FcX4bLdfG6FHXlTfg==","fsize":50502,"resto":118693419,"id":"0SwfU1TJ","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118695517,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)16:58:04","name":"Repatriation or Bust","com":"<a href=\"#p118695163\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118695163<\/a><br>I don&#039;t understand how this is possible.","time":1490734684,"resto":118693419,"id":"5xRsfhKd","country":"GB","trip":"!!39btdVNBQ4M","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118695527,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)16:58:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118695283\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118695283<\/a><br>People confused his comments about policing resources with being sympathetic towards paedophiles, and they&#039;re upset that he wants to draw attention to mild-altering drug use by criminals, when \/pol\/ wants to just rant about muslims","time":1490734691,"resto":118693419,"id":"jB61BTea","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118695529,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)16:58:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118695123\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118695123<\/a>","filename":"KarlMong","ext":".jpg","w":913,"h":681,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1490734692239,"time":1490734692,"md5":"+EEXEO5jz23EKqfdscp4Lw==","fsize":116198,"resto":118693419,"id":"pPtH3azi","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118695538,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)16:58:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"Communists talk about not bringing up identity politics but their mantra is the workers must seize the means of production.

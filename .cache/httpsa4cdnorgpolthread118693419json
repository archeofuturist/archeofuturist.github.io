At the height of the British Empire, all people belonging to the Empire were legally &quot;British Subjects&quot; so that no distinction was made between Australians, Englishmen, Indians, etc. Obviously this had to end when globalization allowed the easy movement of large numbers of people. The govt needed to distinguish between British people and &quot;British&quot; people. The fact this distinction exists shows that there is another prior identity on these isles, which we call &quot;Englishness&quot;. Englishness existed long before the idea of &quot;Britain&quot;, in fact many were opposed to the idea of Britain. When James I unified England and Scotland and inscribed on the coinage Ezekiel 37:22 &quot;one king shall be king to them all: and they shall be no more two nations&quot; many English people were outraged, and did not want to belong to this new &quot;British&quot; identity. Just read George Chapman&#039;s Eastward Hoe written in 1605. <br><br>The English are ENGLISH culturally and &quot;British&quot; politically.<br><a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/118682511#p118692776\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118692776<\/a><br>relevant to the above: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=VGH<wbr>KkPtmXRU","time":1490733704,"resto":118693419,"id":"GxwtI2Xn","country":"GB","trip":"!!RTdZyZlKJyM","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118693527,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)16:41:44","name":"Anonymous","filename":"16194914_1224385107652892_4262668525371221760_n","ext":".jpg","w":480,"h":469,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":122,"tim":1490733704983,"time":1490733704,"md5":"NTpzxy\/nWmO8U+2d0+ZZ1A==","fsize":42003,"resto":118693419,"id":"0SwfU1TJ","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118693568,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)16:42:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"Her Majesty","filename":"hmqe2","ext":".jpg","w":320,"h":400,"tn_w":100,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490733721458,"time":1490733721,"md5":"mWKY5IuQ3wlJNnu6CxGNFg==","fsize":15992,"resto":118693419,"id":"u9e6honE","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118693571,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)16:42:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"Have you read any of Hitchens&#039; books?<br>I really enjoyed &quot;The Cameron Delusion&quot; and &quot;The Abolition of Britain&quot;.","time":1490733722,"resto":118693419,"id":"Q3wPrb+k","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118693626,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)16:42:32","name":"Hull\/fag\/","com":"Flashback to the past","filename":"13517608_1171418286212716_2225806321034326294_o","ext":".jpg","w":1920,"h":1080,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1490733752153,"time":1490733752,"md5":"7+t4COJIrgq4I98y71x5zw==","fsize":290797,"resto":118693419,"id":"0SwfU1TJ","country":"GB","m_img":1,"country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118693706,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)16:43:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"Fuck Europe","filename":"1473921085402","ext":".jpg","w":480,"h":360,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1490733790799,"time":1490733790,"md5":"ABw8nu4kIYfm0ne3Xqs+tw==","fsize":12865,"resto":118693419,"id":"jB61BTea","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118693769,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)16:43:41","name":"Hull\/fag\/","filename":"16708286_10155806301682166_8222711734828404528_n","ext":".jpg","w":250,"h":209,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":104,"tim":1490733821422,"time":1490733821,"md5":"tMUa0cwgifa7MV+jlUPCUg==","fsize":8772,"resto":118693419,"id":"0SwfU1TJ","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118693777,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)16:43:43","name":"LordNelson","com":"Thread theme: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=KkC<wbr>hiylPMM8","filename":"p041gkcb","ext":".jpg","w":1200,"h":675,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1490733823008,"time":1490733823,"md5":"JS5J5kUWZIwVsnQs7AbcPw==","fsize":81934,"resto":118693419,"id":"GxwtI2Xn","country":"GB","m_img":1,"trip":"!!RTdZyZlKJyM","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118693809,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)16:44:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"B I G D A V E<br><br>Do you miss him yet?","filename":"David_Cameron_official","ext":".jpg","w":1440,"h":1920,"tn_w":93,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490733840920,"time":1490733840,"md5":"I4XZcwWl+Szrtne4Dwy3sQ==","fsize":1200320,"resto":118693419,"id":"YnHM39mM","country":"GB","m_img":1,"country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118693835,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)16:44:10","name":"Anonymous","filename":"1455974023003","ext":".png","w":1000,"h":667,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1490733850383,"time":1490733850,"md5":"ua02b1kRQzfm+m2p2ItIYQ==","fsize":1079293,"resto":118693419,"id":"2Und64mQ","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118693881,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)16:44:32","name":"Hull\/fag\/","com":"<a href=\"#p118693777\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118693777<\/a><br>I prefer this: <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ST<wbr>353mDWL3Q<\/span>","time":1490733872,"resto":118693419,"id":"0SwfU1TJ","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118693915,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)16:44:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Z7q<wbr>qTxFuSdc<br><br>Speakers Corner is no longer a free speech zone.","time":1490733888,"resto":118693419,"id":"okUU1T0W","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"}]}

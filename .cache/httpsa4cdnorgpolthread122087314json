Your &quot;God Emperor&quot; wants to shut down the last hope for humanity that isn&#039;t wrapped in lies and corruption.<br><br>Think about how much you owe to these guys. They&#039;re literally risking their lives to inform you. They are fucking heroes exposing the truth about things like ISIS, Vault 7, and Clinton.<br><br>Why aren&#039;t you guys causing an uproar about this? I thought that was your guys&#039; deal, the truth. Isn&#039;t 4chan all about anonymity? The government (Under both Obama and Trump) want to take that away. They want to inform Big Brother about each and every little thing you are doing. The only thing between us and this dystopian future is Wikileaks, and you, the very people who Wikileaks is trying to save, are actively supporting their biggest enemy.<br><br>You&#039;re hypocrits if you aren&#039;t doing all you can to keep Wikileaks alive.","filename":"IMG_2409","ext":".png","w":360,"h":240,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1492744226893,"time":1492744226,"md5":"TNXiukje+JfwnBxeJACA9g==","fsize":17227,"resto":0,"id":"oYgauVaA","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"its-about-time-we-talked-about-these-guys-your","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

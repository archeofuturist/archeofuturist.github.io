In a family, merits and success have little sway over age. I also found the gender roles to be odd. It is common for the wife to manage the funds of the family, giving the husband an allowance. Often they spend much of the money on &quot;showing face&quot; and save none for retirement. Believing their, often single child, will provide for them in old age. Spousal loyalty is also non-existent, men have mistresses, and woman will often &quot;separate&quot; for a bit to date then go back.","filename":"th","ext":".jpg","w":300,"h":269,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":112,"tim":1491657466098,"time":1491657466,"md5":"huhWVlGHzSIx9YeNTjZLSw==","fsize":7529,"resto":120128148,"id":"WXStQcJs","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":120130204,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)09:17:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120129991\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120129991<\/a><br>Yes","time":1491657475,"resto":120128148,"id":"hSP9aRJb","country":"TR","country_name":"Turkey"},{"no":120130247,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)09:18:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120128148\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120128148<\/a><br>I haven&#039;t met many if any so i do not know more about the chinese than i see in movies.<br><br>I think china is on its way up from a poor 3rd world country to a first class state but they need to implement democracy before joining the top elite.","time":1491657500,"resto":120128148,"id":"Oz\/4bwGF","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":120130296,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)09:18:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"whoa that shitty wok owner... why, he wouldn&#039;t even harm a fry.","time":1491657527,"resto":120128148,"id":"Ct8zjIaR","country":"TR","country_name":"Turkey"},{"no":120130313,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)09:18:59","name":"xX420BLAZEDYOLOGODXx","com":"<a href=\"#p120129772\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120129772<\/a><br>oh god how will a fat well fed 6ft2 aussie ever win a fight with a malnourished 5ft2 chinese farmer<br><br>we are doomed","filename":"heSAIDheDOESNTdoSTEROIDS","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":720,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1491657539831,"time":1491657539,"md5":"DifYjjPeIC2SOPq18E2ieA==","fsize":78530,"resto":120128148,"id":"9TLEvIgU","country":"AU","m_img":1,"country_name":"Australia"},{"no":120130317,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)09:19:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120128148\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120128148<\/a><br>If they could get rid of the commies and &quot;traditional medicine&quot; assholes they would rock.","time":1491657543,"resto":120128148,"id":"rxNePRrD","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120130375,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)09:19:34","name":"xX420BLAZEDYOLOGODXx","com":"<a href=\"#p120130193\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120130193<\/a><br>am i just retarded or do all chinese girls look the same","filename":"fastnig","ext":".png","w":249,"h":238,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":119,"tim":1491657574410,"time":1491657574,"md5":"+xCq7WdixpuNNdyoCmMxLg==","fsize":55902,"resto":120128148,"id":"9TLEvIgU","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":120130377,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)09:19:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120130247\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120130247<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;democracy working efficiently for 2 billion people<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;<\/span>","time":1491657575,"resto":120128148,"id":"qefqHjDg","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120130398,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)09:19:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"Your history is amazing.","time":1491657593,"resto":120128148,"id":"jTyl9\/Dk","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120130418,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)09:20:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120128148\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120128148<\/a><br>your language sounds like shit (but then again so do most asian languages)<br>you boil dogs alive and then eat them<br><br>bruce lee was cool though","time":1491657602,"resto":120128148,"id":"229yFXFx","country":"GR","country_name":"Greece"},{"no":120130442,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)09:20:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120129530\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120129530<\/a><br>Lul believing this as an excuse for putting out shit movies.

Here is your chance to craft legislation.<br><br>The H-1B is a non-immigrant visa in the United States under the Immigration and Nationality Act, section 101(a)(17)(H). It allows U.S. employers to temporarily employ foreign workers in specialty occupations.<br><br>As H-1B visas should only used for specialized skillsets that are rare and near unaquireable in the United States, the overall work force for a tech company like Google should not exceed a certain percentage of H-1B applicants. For example, filling more than 30% of employee positions suggests that the positions are not specialty-based, therefore do not qualify for H-1B status. In the event that a tech company legitimately needs more specialized help, it can subcontract out to a contractor that too would be limited in how many employee positions can be filled with H-1B employees.<br><br>By doing this, the H-1B visa cap can be completely eliminated and based strictly on not exceeding a certain percentage of American employees working at a company. As the company grows, the amount of employee positions increase, allowing more H-1B slots to be available. Likwise, a small tech company just starting up can compete with already established large tech companies for H-1B visas. In essence, if the U.S. economy doesn&#039;t grow or actually shrinks, less H-1B slots are available.<br><br>What percentage of foreign specialized employees should not exceed the total workforce at a tech company? <br><br>Does \/pol\/ think it should be 0%? 1%? 10%? 30%? Justify your percentage.","filename":"37799848","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":503,"tn_w":248,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493943702634,"time":1493943702,"md5":"rPEjil9RVExeL1PBemXPQA==","fsize":42014,"resto":0,"id":"Hw7c6N74","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"pol-crafting-h1b-legislation","country_name":"United States","replies":3,"images":0,"unique_ips":4},{"no":124136650,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)20:24:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"No one with a salary below $250k should be eligible for h1b","time":1493943888,"resto":124136294,"id":"VsKfNbTn","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124136941,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)20:27:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"It&#039;s not something that should be based on any arbitrary numbers.

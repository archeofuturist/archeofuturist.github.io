We knew for a while the secret to combat aging was to turn telomerase back on. Telomerase protects the ends of a chromosome from being degraded. This is also how cancer works - it turns telomerase back on but only in select cells which quickly spread and invade other parts of the body. Some cells go bad - trauma, radiation, wear n tear, etc - and need to be destroyed. When they aren&#039;t destroyed - that&#039;s how neoplasia and cancer arises. You can&#039;t have one without the other. We already tried this in animals and they get massive amounts of cancer over time. Current medicine can only do so much. Forget about the bullshit you here on the news. We do develop new cancer drugs every year but they only target very, very specific forms of cancer. It&#039;ll be hundreds of years before we can stop all cancer and by then we&#039;ll already be dead.","time":1491003809,"resto":119102485,"id":"R494WQHn","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119116264,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)19:43:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119102485\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119102485<\/a><br>this will NEVER EVER see the light of day<br><br>teh only persons having acccess to this are the ULTRA rich<br><br>do you think they wanna see all you assholes live forever?<br><br>MAYBE if the fucking civilized world stopped worrying about birthrates and let them decline. more people would have access to this<br><br>BUT NOPE, liberals gotta fuck that up to and bring shit skins into predominatly white cultures to UP the birth rate<br><br>So guess what.

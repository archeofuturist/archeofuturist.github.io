A lot of people are losing their minds and calling him a sellout while not understanding that Alex is legally liable for the things he says unlike faggots commenting on youtube videos. It should be obvious to people that the apology was made under duress and was a neccessary strategic move for infowars. <br><br>People are getting caught up in purity tests instead of focusing on victory over the globalists. Trump has never mentioned pizzagate of elite pedophile networks, does that make him a sellout? Of course not, he isn&#039;t in a position where he can say things like that and I think everyone understands,so why can&#039;t these same people understand the position that Alex is in?<br><br>Every attempt to divide the right needs to be resisted regardless of how you feel about the individual being attacked. The only thing that matters in this battle is victory. Nothing else is meaningful, and everything needs to be viewed through the prism of achieving victory. How can we get people to understand that purity spiraling isn&#039;t productive and that the focus needs to be on winning?","filename":"1490332233492","ext":".gif","w":230,"h":230,"tn_w":230,"tn_h":230,"tim":1490406516525,"time":1490406516,"md5":"asax9dyE5c2c8bw\/w1+f\/g==","fsize":1180553,"resto":0,"id":"H+\/hCfxi","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"is-this-pizzagate-thing-the-globalists-attempt-to","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":118168957,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)21:57:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"Trump: &quot;Jeff Sessions will take care of politicians that were bribed with &quot;something else&quot; other than campaign contributions, I wouldn&#039;t want to be them.&quot; <br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/Riph4NCx_U0?t=3h42<wbr>m13s<br><br>Gowdy, Goodlatte, Jackson Lee Introduce Bill to Help Child Pornography Trafficking Victims<br>https:\/\/gowdy.house.gov\/media-cente<wbr>r\/press-releases\/gowdy-goodlatte-ja<wbr>ckson-lee-introduce-bill-help-child<wbr>-pornography<br><br>Ivanka Trump Pushes White House Agenda to Human Trafficking<br>http:\/\/www.breitbart.com\/big-govern<wbr>ment\/2017\/02\/24\/ivanka-trump-pushes<wbr>-white-house-agenda-human-trafficki<wbr>ng\/","time":1490407036,"resto":118167850,"id":"oGTQ6ltz","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118169207,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)21:58:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118168957\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118168957<\/a><br>These are all good examples of pursuing victory behind the scenes.

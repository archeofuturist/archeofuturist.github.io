And religion doesn&#039;t change because it&#039;s not about changing and expanding physical knowledge, but it is, by definition codified, unchanging beliefs. But no one cares about that. They just want to meme about how old religion is (although they always just try to shit on Christianity). It&#039;s so silly. <br><br>But the reaction to this, is Christians so afraid of &quot;contradicting science&quot; that they don&#039;t really believe in God at all.

It&#039;s (for protestants anyway) 66 different books written over the course of ~1500 years. The reason for believing the Christian narrative for me, comes from Jesus&#039; resurrection, of which was reported by &quot;secular&quot; and &quot;religious&quot; people, and whose post-mortem appearances were recorded across very very large spaces. That&#039;s why I believe Jesus was who He claimed to be. Secondly, the Christian narrative as it seems to me, to describe my heart, the human heart, and the human condition in exactly the way it is, and that there IS truth to the way it describes the world. Maybe not the nature of quarks or neutrinos or such. But in the most abstract realm. <br>Thirdly, it is what I would call a subjective truth, a term I borrow from Soren Kierkegaard. Meaning, that while it is indeed true, it requires full delving into, a &quot;leap of faith&quot; to understand\/experience as true. And I&#039;ve experienced it as true. I&#039;ve experienced the presence and breath of God, I&#039;ve prayed enough and waited on God enough to hear Him. Which might sound all magical and crazy... But it&#039;s a truth to me. A subjective truth.","filename":"1489268384325","ext":".png","w":365,"h":450,"tn_w":101,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491766792633,"time":1491766792,"md5":"R\/L\/grtSEmm1gtNWxnCjyg==","fsize":308965,"resto":120317604,"id":"YoHCSNCG","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120324853,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)15:40:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120324107\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120324107<\/a><br>whatever you say dude","filename":"christianity1","ext":".jpg","w":1784,"h":1024,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":71,"tim":1491766849393,"time":1491766849,"md5":"E3dbGvloSG+M2L9UAHSkVQ==","fsize":439826,"resto":120317604,"id":"KA0hbQZ3","country":"FR","m_img":1,"country_name":"France"},{"no":120325103,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)15:42:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120324728\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120324728<\/a><br>No they didn&#039;t.

You are fighting a losing battle. People may individually hold spiritual beliefs, but organized religion is on the way out, even in the Islamic world, although it may not seem like it. Religion served its purpose, its time to move on. Also when you desperately cling to religion you become incapable of justifying anti-degeneracy views. You can no longer use &quot;god&quot; as an argument for why fags shouldnt be celebrated. You are holding us back and inadvertently promoting degeneracy because if &quot;god&quot; is your only explanation for your values then you no longer hold sway over the godless masses.

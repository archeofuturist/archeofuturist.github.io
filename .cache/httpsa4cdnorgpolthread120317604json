And religion doesn&#039;t change because it&#039;s not about changing and expanding physical knowledge, but it is, by definition codified, unchanging beliefs. But no one cares about that. They just want to meme about how old religion is (although they always just try to shit on Christianity). It&#039;s so silly. <br><br>But the reaction to this, is Christians so afraid of &quot;contradicting science&quot; that they don&#039;t really believe in God at all.

That&#039;s why I believe Jesus was who He claimed to be. Secondly, the Christian narrative as it seems to me, to describe my heart, the human heart, and the human condition in exactly the way it is, and that there IS truth to the way it describes the world. Maybe not the nature of quarks or neutrinos or such. But in the most abstract realm. <br>Thirdly, it is what I would call a subjective truth, a term I borrow from Soren Kierkegaard.

I&#039;ve experienced the presence and breath of God, I&#039;ve prayed enough and waited on God enough to hear Him. Which might sound all magical and crazy... But it&#039;s a truth to me.

Every great undertaking, the space program, every large and great infrastructure program, all of science, is only possible because of a massive collective effort. Collectivism will be necessary for the goals and undertakings we have to face as humans in the future? Why are people so opposed to collectivism when it is the foundation of our human society?","filename":"NuremburgRally","ext":".jpg","w":631,"h":300,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":118,"tim":1493168904424,"time":1493168904,"md5":"VuAeoTx\/0eXWViDZaXT8+A==","fsize":145315,"resto":0,"id":"MlXFVXPd","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"whats-wrong-with-collectivism","country_name":"United States","replies":3,"images":0,"unique_ips":4},{"no":122819377,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)21:12:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122818809\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122818809<\/a><br>As long as it&#039;s nationalistic and for the people&#039;s interests, it would be fine.

Not that it isn&#039;t possible with collectivism...<br><br>I am a Genetic Engineer and the way I see the world is that we should advance. Humans should keep on &quot;evolving&quot; so that the strongest of men can conquer the world and then the stars. People can still be happy if they contribute to their country. Men were happy when they invented something, when they built something, when they accomplished anything, really. People can accomplish things for their countrymen so they can live better. <br><br>People in the modern world do not care about eachother, it is all about themselves. If people found happiness in contribution to society, then humans would develop faster. They boycott against foods that harm them. They refuse to watch things that weaken them. People as a whole think that getting drunk and watching a drama TV show is boring, and find things such as mathematics\/science\/health\/politics<wbr>\/art to be -real- enjoyable things.<br><br><a href=\"#p122819943\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122819943<\/a><br>Also this.

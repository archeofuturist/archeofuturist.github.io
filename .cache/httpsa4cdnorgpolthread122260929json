You would be forced to believe 2+2 is 5 if they demand it. How is this not humiliating to you? <br><br>You seem to understand how power corrupts and how corruption is inevitable, so why do you want to make it even harder to fight it? <br><br>Democracy, including separation of power\/checks and balances is simply the least bad system. It&#039;s far from ideal, but shit you would replace it with would be even worse. <br><br>Keep in mind you idolize Nazi Germany simply because you know little about it, and it lasted shortly. They basically had 6 years before war erupted, and in the next 6 years they collapsed. Inherent flaws of such system didn&#039;t really express themselves so obviously, because of lack of time. <br><br>If Nazi Germany somehow endured, it wouldn&#039;t be too different from Soviet Union. It would perhaps be better in some ways, but ANY system like that is inherently inefficient and corrupt.","filename":"history_radio_prague_answers_propaganda_speech_sf_still_624x352-1516b243b5a51c9c9c6-1516B5CA85A22255FE5","ext":".jpg","w":624,"h":352,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":141,"tim":1492855529940,"time":1492855529,"md5":"FXaNfKqY4Vj12LzJHir1Zw==","fsize":59567,"resto":0,"id":"XaVYJ49V","country":"ME","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"be-polfag","country_name":"Montenegro","replies":11,"images":1,"unique_ips":6},{"no":122261022,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)06:06:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122260929\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122260929<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Totalitarian<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;natsoc germany<\/span><br>Pick one","time":1492855608,"resto":122260929,"id":"Gh0cClpp","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122261132,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)06:08:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122261022\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122261022<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;natsoc germany<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;not totalitarian<\/span><br>Why are Americans this stupid?

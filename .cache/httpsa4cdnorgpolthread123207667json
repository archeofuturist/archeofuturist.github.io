As soon as a child is capable of grasping that they own their body, logically, no one should be able to tell them what to do with it so long as it does not violate the NAP. And who gets to decide when a child has truly understood that they own their body? Arguably, it is as soon as a child has learned to say &#039;NO&#039;, because that indicates that they are able to act and assert their will. And this usually happens around what, two or three years old? According to this logic, if a child says that they consent to sex, no one can stop them without an appeal to some arbitrary standard, or else reject the NAP or the principle of self-ownership.","time":1493395056,"resto":123207667,"id":"ZvRZocT5","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123208933,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)11:57:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123208585\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123208585<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;stop this retarded meme<\/span><br><br>Maybe it doesn&#039;t happen often, but hormonal treatment for children does happen.

They do give GNRH inhibitors like triptorelin or histerelin, which only delays the onset of secondary sex characteristics. These are the exact same medicines given to children with early onset puberty. Which is debatable, and it&#039;s a grey area, but it&#039;s not an irreversible procedure like surgery and cross sex hormones. Especially surgery is never done on minors. Also the child cannot consent, every single case needs the parent&#039;s consent and approval for the procedure to be started. The children themselves cannot decide on their own accord whether or not to start a therapy with blockers, or hormones, unless they&#039;re 18.","time":1493395881,"resto":123207667,"id":"DUSChBKy","country":"IT","country_name":"Italy"},{"no":123210598,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)12:12:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123208690\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123208690<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;how is it not child abuse to let your kid take hormones and puberty blockers<\/span><br><br>I really don&#039;t know.

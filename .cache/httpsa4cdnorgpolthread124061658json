The &quot;poor dilapidated russia&quot; meme is a bit of an outdated thing, or rather it depends heavily on geography. Whilst it was true for all of russia in the 90s today western russia is pretty much the same as eastern EU plus free healthcare, education and opportunity to be a literal bond villian if you go into politics. <br><br>Those who really want to go to US\/EU want it either because of ideology, or because they want to try and join high ranks of a megacorp. Moving for the sake of quality of life is simple naivite, because very few can actually afford to move and hold a decent job. It&#039;s an ongoing topic of propaganda in russian duma and media to show how crap the lifes of skilled russians are after such a move. Propaganda being what it is it fails to cover occasional success story, but generally, if what you care about is good life you are better of staying in russia and simply moving to a bigger city. Just don&#039;t move to Moscow. It has all the same issues as moving to US\/EU minus the novelty. <br><a href=\"#p124061962\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124061962<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The 2-3% living near all the western border<\/span><br>Most of Russia&#039;s population (&gt;50%) live in geographic europe.

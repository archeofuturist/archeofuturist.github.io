Anything else is optional but this is the most basic thing that they wear. Also, if you have sunglasses wear them to hide your identity. <br> To Disperse the crowd I recommend some type of non lethal firework with a big presence. This one here would be a good start https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=9b6<wbr>TwG0KR_A&amp;ab_channel=GrantThompson-%<wbr>22TheKingofRandom%22. However, I recommend making multiple smaller bombs instead of one large one like in the video here. A bomb half of the size of the one in the video would be a good starting point. Start with one with a 30 second fuse and make ones 5 seconds shorter each time (30,25,20,15,10 no shorter than 10 seconds). When using, light the 30 second one and drop it when no one is looking.Move away from the bomb and 5 seconds later light the next shortest one. Continue until you use the 10 second one.This is best if used in conjunction with other people to cause the most confusion. At that point you should get out.

Everyone still plowed the land, worked in a shop, there was plenty of work for even simple people and higher IQ didn&#039;t benefit you in your village.<br><br>However these days more and more jobs require you to have skills operating a computer or other device, some sort of book keeping, constant training as technologies change.<br>Even just selling sandwiches requires you to work several machines in the preparation, work the computer to input each sale, do math to calculate money to take and how to return the chance, improvise when you haven&#039;t the different coins available or some of the materials, and stuff like that.<br><br>The American Army sets its draft at 80 IQ. An institution that wants every single possible person it can get says lower than that is simply not fit for being shot at abroad. <br>This is the bare minimum for functioning and being useful. And in any competitive market job, its more like 90 IQ.<br><br>Regardless of any eugenics or training, the regression to the mean and simple chance will produce such lower IQ people. They can&#039;t work. They will be unemployed. As the IQ requirement for jobs rises since they become more complex, and the simple ones get automated, more and more people will be unable to secure an income.<br><br>What do you propose we do with all those people that are simply unfit to be useful, as a machine can do their job better, cheaper?<br>Keep it politics, suggest policies, not sci-fi.","filename":"bots","ext":".png","w":580,"h":210,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":90,"tim":1493197328744,"time":1493197328,"md5":"otu67fHo5Jke36Oz7N\/DSg==","fsize":12628,"resto":0,"id":"vScE0nwo","country":"BG","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"iq-requirements-for-a-successful-life-in-the-12st","country_name":"Bulgaria","replies":8,"images":0,"unique_ips":8},{"no":122864093,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)05:06:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"kill people below 100 IQ who are not humble","time":1493197562,"resto":122863868,"id":"ZKA4r1an","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":122864298,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)05:09:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122864093\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122864093<\/a><br>Regression towards the mean will ensure that your eugenics program doesn&#039;t produce reliable results.<br>Randomness of heritability will ensure you still get stupid people.<br><br>If you take the highest IQ man and the highest IQ woman, and they have a child, it is extremely unlikely the child will have comparable IQ to them.","time":1493197756,"resto":122863868,"id":"vScE0nwo","country":"BG","country_name":"Bulgaria"},{"no":122864727,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)05:16:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122863868\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122863868<\/a><br>Realistically?

There is still conscription ( yeah, I looked it up). I&#039;ve met a lot of Israeli people during my travels. A lot of angry young guys trying to &#039;deflate&#039; from their army service. &#039;It drains your soul&#039; one told me. And why is there hebrew writing on all the hostels I visit. Is it like a &#039;heads up&#039; for your family? The clich\u00e9 still holds true. They are stingy as fuck.

Any country which jails people simply because someone is offended or feels uncomfortable has established that criticism of certain topics are to be suppressed at gunpoint, and is not truly a free country. Proponents of hate speech laws will sometimes point to people being threatened on account of their race, but why should we only extend protection from the broader behavior of coercion to this one particular manifestation? Make coercion and incitement illegal under all circumstances, and leave the nebulous and easily exploitable &quot;hate&quot; laws out of it.","filename":"us-constitution","ext":".jpg","w":1920,"h":1200,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":156,"tim":1493949031251,"time":1493949031,"md5":"GKwFFICuI9f9IsctI1MyUA==","fsize":1025759,"resto":0,"id":"eYROoY5h","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"first-ammendment-for-european-nations","country_name":"United States","replies":4,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":124148933,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)22:06:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124147060\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124147060<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Incitement, coercion, and slander<\/span><br>keep dreaming bro, those are bulshit criterias<br><br>Here we have a law that will impresion you for incitment to hate.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Trump is a fag<\/span><br>That can put you behind bars","time":1493949997,"resto":124147060,"id":"MEHFxWTI","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":124149298,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)22:09:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124147060\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124147060<\/a><br>2nd amendment &gt; 1st amendment","time":1493950199,"resto":124147060,"id":"cuIgjYWn","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124149545,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)22:11:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124148933\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124148933<\/a><br><br>What&#039;s bullshit about them?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;incitement to hate<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;hate<\/span><br><br>That&#039;s the sort of &quot;nuance&quot; that I was talking about. Free speech is only a nuanced topic in the eyes of totalitarians who don&#039;t want free speech for their political opposition.

The right to not hear things which offend you is mutually exclusive with free speech.","time":1493950311,"resto":124147060,"id":"eYROoY5h","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124149654,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)22:12:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124149298\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124149298<\/a><br><br>Both are equally necessary for protecting the peace and guarding against totalitarianism.","time":1493950375,"resto":124147060,"id":"eYROoY5h","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

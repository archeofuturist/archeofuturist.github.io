He should have expected shit to go down like it did, expecting to catch a taxi out of there was naive. The antifas ripped him out of the one taxi that would allow him in. They chased him through the city for a good half hour\/hour, one guy on a bike following him and blowing a vuvuzela to alert the other antifas to his location.

A way to bipass this mechanism is to pretend you&#039;re friendly.<br><br>I do this by starting out agreeing with the narrative being pushed and then I take it to the logical extreme. This has an effect no matter what. Either the group says wait no that&#039;s too far (in which case I say &quot;wtf? why?&quot; and they are forced to argue against their own logic which doesn&#039;t activate any defense mechanisms (this can also be used on yourself to test the validity of your worldview)).<br><br>Otherwise, the group agrees and ends up looking even more retarded to the centrists thereby filling our ranks. Their increased extremism isn&#039;t an issue though because you can repeat this process and keep pushing their arguments to their logical limits.<br><br>The issues though are that you must be well-versed in their ideology and you must also know where to draw the line so as not to look fake.<br><br>Anyway, I know this isn&#039;t the only way and I&#039;d like to learn some more tactics from people who actually have experience changing minds.","filename":"trump-hands-320x320","ext":".jpg","w":320,"h":320,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492802240647,"time":1492802240,"md5":"ZV+w\/a8\/HuEFmUx95NOFIQ==","fsize":28887,"resto":0,"id":"hXgcKrT0","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"itt-we-discuss-psychological-subversion-tactics","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

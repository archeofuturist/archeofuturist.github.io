It&#039;s how comfortable you are with manipulating hypothetical concepts according to abstract logic. There is a genetic component, that much is obvious from twin studies, but twin studies also show that there is a very large non-genetic component. <br><br>It reminds me of the work of a Soviet neuropsychologist named A.R. Luria who, among other shit, studied the effect of Soviet literacy programs on illiterate Uzbek peasants. He interviews a bunch of these Uzbeks and asks them logic and pattern recognition problems and their thinking is so concrete and functional, as opposed to abstract, it&#039;s downright fascinating. Of course, Uzbekistan now has a high literacy rate and most people there think in a manner typical to literate urban people around the world (I visited in 2015), which I think does show that being trained and exposed to problems that require abstract thought can increase IQ. I don&#039;t think the genetics necessarily changed significantly.

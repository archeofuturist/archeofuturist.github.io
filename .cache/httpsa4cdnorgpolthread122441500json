Think about what you would teach a child who needed to be guided by his father. A picture will begin to emerge, first of the necessary things and then of the more advanced things needed to round yourself out. You must become strong in mind, body and spirit. In doing so never fall into the trap of putting on a show for anyone else. Your goal should be to become confident in your own abilities to such a degree that you feel you have nothing to prove to anyone. The people that show off at the gym aren&#039;t the ones you should seek to emulate. Their show only displays their own insecurities. It&#039;s a display of confidence to other men that betrays their self doubt. To the perceptive it reeks of, &quot;Am I doing it right? I&#039;m unsure of myself but afraid to show it so I must add a layer of bluster.&quot; That&#039;s for niggers, not men. If you do it right you&#039;ll be strong and stoic, able to handle any situation calmly. People will gravitate to your leadership naturally. Ultimately, you need to understand that this is something that only you can do. Even if you had a father you are the one responsible for what you become.

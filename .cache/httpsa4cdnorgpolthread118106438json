You should not care about anyone else&#039;s healthcare (aside from your family\/friends or anyone you choose to care about). You should not care about anyone else&#039;s well being. The entire structure of our society is based on a false premise, that we are meant to care for people we don&#039;t naturally care about.<br><br>If we had to actually, physically, hand over our money\/resources to random strangers, virtually no one would do it. It&#039;s easy to talk about helping others when it&#039;s done with the ghostly hand of government. But in truth, nobody cares about doing it and nobody wants to do it. There&#039;s no reason why we should be having a national conversation about healthcare, or education, or any of that bullshit. People are much better off when relying more on a stable family unit, or social\/village structure than government.<br><br>The entire structure of the government is incorrect, and thus almost all of the discussions in government now are useless.","filename":"535c6781be1af187637ed6f2bc8bc4c1","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":500,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490377769565,"time":1490377769,"md5":"nEBqt+vQV37PrKTuQ9dtag==","fsize":56060,"resto":0,"id":"DvVmutoY","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-entire-way-we-think-about-society-is-wrong","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":118106932,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)13:53:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118106438\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118106438<\/a><br>The world was good (white).<br>Then you learned the evils of the state.

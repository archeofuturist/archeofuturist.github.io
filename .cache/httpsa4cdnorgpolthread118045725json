(who&#039;s actually a CIA operative??), apparently concocted Internet traffic logs in order to falsely incriminate Donald Trump by making it appear that a Russian bank and a server registered to an independent marketing company (Cendyn) retained by Trump, were improperly communicating. Tea Leaves shopped his his\/her story to several well-known media outlets, most of which, after their own investigations, refused to bite. However, Franklin Foer, a notorious political writer with a lengthy history working for democratically-biased publications such as the Huffington Post and The New Republic, fell for it and wrote a hit piece entitled &quot;Was A Trump Server (1\/2)<\/span>","time":1490334530,"resto":118045725,"id":"w2Y0c4MB","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118048620,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)01:49:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118048220\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118048220<\/a><br>We Redditors just decided to come join you 4chaners because you guys seemed so smart with the whole Shia LeBTFO thing.<br><br>You guys should hear this thing that this based JEW said to me...","time":1490334541,"resto":118045725,"id":"HFfxgYOF","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118048633,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)01:49:09","name":"Autismo Squadron Leader [+1]","com":"<a href=\"#p118048602\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118048602<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Communicating With Russia?&quot; which was published by Slate on Oct. 31, 2016.

And it&#039;s important to note that the Trump server NEVER communicated with the Russian bank (i.e., there were NO DNS lookups initiated by the Trump server regarding the Russian bank&#039;s server); it was the Russian bank&#039;s server that had repeatedly pinged the Trump server, there was NO back-and-forth communication between the two computers. In layman&#039;s terms, the situation was simply that the Russian bank&#039;s server had &quot;looked up&quot; the Trump server&#039;s contact information (just like you might open a phone book and look up Trump&#039;s telephone number), but never made a call. And, in fact, the Trump server wasn&#039;t even actually his! It was the property of a marketing company (Cendyn) Trump hired in connection with his hotel business&#039; sales efforts to, among other things, send out emails world wide to promote the hotels. The Russian bank&#039;s &quot;pings&quot; in response to receipt of such emails is something that is ROUTINELY done by servers to protect themselves against spam, etc. The ONLY THING NEFARIOUS about the whole situation was Tea Leaves&#039; use of his\/her doctored logs to make it APPEAR that inappropriate activity had occurred as he\/she apparently conned Foer, who clearly is NOT Internet-savvy, into believing as he fell for Tea Leaves&#039; scheme.<\/span>","time":1490334549,"resto":118045725,"id":"w2Y0c4MB","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118048747,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)01:50:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"I can&#039;t tell whether this is \/ourguy\/.

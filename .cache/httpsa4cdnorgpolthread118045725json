(who&#039;s actually a CIA operative??), apparently concocted Internet traffic logs in order to falsely incriminate Donald Trump by making it appear that a Russian bank and a server registered to an independent marketing company (Cendyn) retained by Trump, were improperly communicating. Tea Leaves shopped his his\/her story to several well-known media outlets, most of which, after their own investigations, refused to bite. However, Franklin Foer, a notorious political writer with a lengthy history working for democratically-biased publications such as the Huffington Post and The New Republic, fell for it and wrote a hit piece entitled &quot;Was A Trump Server (1\/2)<\/span>","time":1490334530,"resto":118045725,"id":"w2Y0c4MB","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118048620,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)01:49:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118048220\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118048220<\/a><br>We Redditors just decided to come join you 4chaners because you guys seemed so smart with the whole Shia LeBTFO thing.<br><br>You guys should hear this thing that this based JEW said to me...","time":1490334541,"resto":118045725,"id":"HFfxgYOF","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118048633,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)01:49:09","name":"Autismo Squadron Leader [+1]","com":"<a href=\"#p118048602\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118048602<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Communicating With Russia?&quot; which was published by Slate on Oct. 31, 2016.

And it&#039;s important to note that the Trump server NEVER communicated with the Russian bank (i.e., there were NO DNS lookups initiated by the Trump server regarding the Russian bank&#039;s server); it was the Russian bank&#039;s server that had repeatedly pinged the Trump server, there was NO back-and-forth communication between the two computers. In layman&#039;s terms, the situation was simply that the Russian bank&#039;s server had &quot;looked up&quot; the Trump server&#039;s contact information (just like you might open a phone book and look up Trump&#039;s telephone number), but never made a call. And, in fact, the Trump server wasn&#039;t even actually his! It was the property of a marketing company (Cendyn) Trump hired in connection with his hotel business&#039; sales efforts to, among other things, send out emails world wide to promote the hotels. The Russian bank&#039;s &quot;pings&quot; in response to receipt of such emails is something that is ROUTINELY done by servers to protect themselves against spam, etc. The ONLY THING NEFARIOUS about the whole situation was Tea Leaves&#039; use of his\/her doctored logs to make it APPEAR that inappropriate activity had occurred as he\/she apparently conned Foer, who clearly is NOT Internet-savvy, into believing as he fell for Tea Leaves&#039; scheme.<\/span>","time":1490334549,"resto":118045725,"id":"w2Y0c4MB","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118048747,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)01:50:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"I can&#039;t tell whether this is \/ourguy\/.

Now, the kicker is that (a) Fannie and Freddie are not the government companies, they are private companies and (b) they control $6T book of mortgages. So the size and the scope of a fraud is huge. In law suits, Obama exerted presidential privilege covering his communication of his admin discussing the expropriation. That my friend is a criminal case against Obama for fraud. Nobody gave a shit. This? This is minor. There is paper trail, there is forensic accounting, the whole nine yards.

I\u2019m a graduate student in the School of Informatics at Indiana University. I study a variety of things, most recently biological modeling. I\u2019ve looked at some epidemic models, gene regulatory models, and Markov models for gene detection. I\u2019ve also done research into capabilities of covert channels and the use of communication theory to aide in the development of security interfaces.<br><br>What: A blog about my accomplishments and research interests. I\u2019ve done some interesting things, at least in my own mind. Some people I talk to find them interesting, too. I\u2019ve been working with a great group of people on a project called Network Workbench. I\u2019ve been able to present some of my work as part of the larger project at McGill University. I also have a couple of papers upcoming. From my earlier studies, I have a technical report about the wonders of covert channels and I\u2019ve spoken at a few conferences about that work as well.<br><br>Where: The Internet and wherever you, the reader, are. I\u2019m currently working at Network Workbench at Indiana University, Bloomington. I\u2019ve been in Bloomington for a couple of years now; it is a wonderful place to live.<br><br>When: Only occasionally, I\u2019m busy pursuing my research interests. I also have several hobbies. I enjoy investigating artificial life, reading, and when time permits, exercise, typically either swimming, tennis, or martial arts, though these days it is mostly walking. I also try to do some traveling. I spent nearly four years in Japan studying and traveling.<br><br>Why: To share information, contribute to a body of knowledge, and create a professional presence.<br><br>How: Through the wonders of technology.&quot;<br><br>Kinda reminds me of, &quot;Who is Vault 7? What is Vault 7? Why is Vault 7?&quot;. <br><br>Hmmm.","time":1490338732,"resto":118045725,"id":"34B\/4M1C","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118054367,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)02:59:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"Q U I C K<br><br>R U N D O W N","time":1490338752,"resto":118045725,"id":"0FJgntlw","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":118054378,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)02:59:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"Bump","time":1490338761,"resto":118045725,"id":"7NK7B+uv","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118054504,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)03:01:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118054378\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118054378<\/a><br>bump","time":1490338860,"resto":118045725,"id":"ZmkeNrWT","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118054572,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)03:01:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118052976\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118052976<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;not knowing that pasta<\/span><br>Gas the normies when?","time":1490338914,"resto":118045725,"id":"I3x+EsGy","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118054591,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)03:02:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118048912\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118048912<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;i was literally talking to one the other day at the gym<\/span><br>why are you such a fucking traitor? probably a fucking communist like bernie sanders","time":1490338931,"resto":118045725,"id":"decQN\/Te","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118054624,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)03:02:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"I have no idea what&#039;s going on<br><br>Someone pretending to be Trump and the (((globalists))) used fake Trump posting to start the whole muh russia shit?","filename":"1458708127364","ext":".png","w":576,"h":507,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":110,"tim":1490338956228,"time":1490338956,"md5":"GWTyXJEN5TlgxbGBB6+A5A==","fsize":196104,"resto":118045725,"id":"K0iLBI59","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118054630,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)03:02:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"What?

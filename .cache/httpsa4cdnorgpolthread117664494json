We wrote down our opinion on it and then the teacher said we have to argue for the exact OPPOSITE of our real opinions because he&#039;s a douchebag like that. I tried to do this on \/b\/ but they posted a bunch of really sad disgusting pictures of animal tests and animals suffering in labs gifs that literally made me cry.

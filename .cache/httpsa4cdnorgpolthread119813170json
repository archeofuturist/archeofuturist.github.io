The hindu priests, which were essentially scholars of all manners of science which could have been done without very specific equipments (math, psychology, sociology etc) designed a sort of permaculture that went in cycles. They designed the information to be conveyed in a &#039;mystical way&#039; so that only future similarly bright minds can find and use its true meaning in guiding others.<br><br>Eveery claim they make, every belief is a metaphor, and lots of claims are based on simple statistics.

They are explanations of how societies cycle through religiousness, and are based on statictics of how people cycled through their temples and in what numbers. They also theorized that this number wuld be steadily decreasing due to genetics and the nature of their study (the best students are celibate, ergo the &quot;smart one&quot; gene slowly recedes in the general society).<br><br>The reason why hinduism is so fucked right now is because of this recessive nature that they caused through making celibacy important. it also caused the downfall of society which was literally geneticly cleansed of smart people.","filename":"1486381084372","ext":".png","w":738,"h":588,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":199,"tim":1491520634589,"time":1491520634,"md5":"GUW4QYQ+Q\/XtICSay\/IIZA==","fsize":176878,"resto":0,"id":"Bq2EdX\/X","country":"PL","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"hinduism-redpill","country_name":"Poland","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

The very definition of free speech in US society is determined by where one stands in relation to those who run this country. Not only is the concept of freedom of speech certain to be manipulated by those who have no intention of defending your free speech, it is an argument based on false assumptions. If Anne Coulter, Milo Y, or some other fascist wannabe wants to exercise their free speech, let them stand out in the middle of Berkeley\u2019s Sproul Plaza or some other public space like the rest of us and make their speech. Then, and only then, is it genuinely free.<\/span>","filename":"1457811341678","ext":".jpg","w":790,"h":820,"tn_w":240,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493507730714,"time":1493507730,"md5":"3hm6r\/3Fm+IS6VXjF5vRSA==","fsize":90014,"resto":0,"id":"kcGNfmGJ","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"why-does-the-left-hate-the-first-amendment-so","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

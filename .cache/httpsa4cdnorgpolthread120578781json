In those cases, as long as the amount was legal for personal possession in Colorado \u2014 one ounce of dried flower, for example \u2014 the local police simply asked the flier to dispose of it, either by throwing it in the trash or taking it home. All 29 complied, and no tickets were issued.<br><br>In 2016, the airport did not keep a record of those stopped with the substance. \u201cThe bottom line is, it\u2019s not an issue,\u201d Mr. Montgomery said.<br><br>Or perhaps they just pack it and travel with it in a way that is subtle enough not to draw attention to it, said Lisa Smith of Seattle. She often travels through airports with marijuana and says many of her friends do as well.<br><br>Local airport authorities handle the situation differently in different states. In Florida, where medical marijuana is legal but recreational use is not, few are stopped for possession in the airport, but they do face penalties. Eleven of the approximately 2.8 million passengers who were screened by T.S.A. at Jacksonville International Airport in 2016 were detained for possession of marijuana, said Michael D. Stewart, the airport\u2019s director of external affairs. All were arrested or given a notice to appear in court, he said.<br><br>T.S.A. agents with dogs that are sniffing people in line by security checkpoints are looking for explosives, not marijuana. Dogs assisting Customs and Border Protection agents, however, are searching for illicit drugs along with other illegal substances, but only among passengers arriving in the United States on international flights.","filename":"Screen Shot 2017-04-11 at 5.38.57 AM","ext":".png","w":1786,"h":1380,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":193,"tim":1491903626707,"time":1491903626,"md5":"PYY6Kn+PUisBbCZo2Wu\/Tw==","fsize":2988170,"resto":0,"id":"VF3MfGm6","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"should-medical-marijuana-patients-be-allowed-to","country_name":"United States","replies":14,"images":0,"unique_ips":11},{"no":120578968,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)05:43:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120578781\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120578781<\/a><br>because you live in a poorly disguised theocracy with outdated drug policy","time":1491903784,"resto":120578781,"id":"9\/ZtBoIP","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120579119,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)05:45:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"I guess it&#039;s somewhat fucked if you cross state lines as different states might classify it differently.

You say Islam is bad for women, but even at present day Christian countries are sexist and prejudiced against women and deny them their right to abortion, not mentioning people of different sexuality. Many Christian countries haven&#039;t legalised same sex marriage, and many Christians openly mock gay people.<br>Muslims were discovering and inventing during the middle ages, while Christians were fucking each other on battlefields.<br>Christianity didn&#039;t spread in Europe peacefully, it spread with brute force. Look at UK for example, it wasn&#039;t a Christian country, until Christians went there and started destroying every monument of original religion.<br>btw. Every religion came from the same source, God, because the river splits into more it doesn&#039;t mean we should hate each other.<br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=kq4<wbr>BFIoPCLI [Embed]<br><br>Maybe you should be more tolerant to your human brethren, maybe then you wouldn&#039;t feel so much hate towards them?","filename":"1638482284","ext":".jpg","w":609,"h":343,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1492276298116,"time":1492276298,"md5":"e45kp7cRQo1oxKkldrMfBw==","fsize":43229,"resto":0,"id":"L1KhThUd","country":"PL","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"religion-of-peace","country_name":"Poland","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":121233831,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)13:27:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121231987\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121231987<\/a><br>The word &quot;Christianity&quot; sounds better than &quot;Islam&quot;.","time":1492277254,"resto":121231987,"id":"gAj8BnbD","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]}

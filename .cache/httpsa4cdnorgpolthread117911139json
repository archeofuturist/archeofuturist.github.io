The way to remove terrorism is to stop being feeling the need to cause it. Big governments fail at this all the time. Maggie fucked up in Ireland by creating a barrier and putting fighters in an ordinary prison. We fuck up at the moment because we continue to fight in the middle east and support the Israelis. What do you expect people to do if they are treated so badly. You would do the same.<br>How to stop it is to become more insular. US fot the US and England for the English. Who give a shit if they are Black or Muslim as long as they are English. Just look at the BBC propaganda machine today. It is full of shit absolutely zero news purely 100% speculation and sound bites.<br>Fuck that cop. He new that standing outside parliament for a job was not the most safe way of earning a wage.

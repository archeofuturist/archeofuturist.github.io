Religion is seen in a negative light and massively misinterpreted as something to be taken as a document of history or an absolute truth rather than a philosophical reference book of fables. Traditional religion is regularly mocked by the media figures that they take on as role models.<br><br>As a secular thinker myself, I agree that secularism is generally good or society. At least I used to think so, but then realised that the average person doesn&#039;t have the capacity for independent thought, much less secular thought based solely on reasoning. We are under the false impression that the feeble peasant is a figure of the past, however, we must realise that only the verbal class distinction has disappeared, not the people which it describes, regardless of better education and more wealth.<br> <br>As a people, we are not ready for total secularism, the public still needs a coherent narrative on which they can base their thoughts and behaviours.<br><br>Add to this the fact that traditional religion requires a lot of work from the prospective follower. There are texts and stories, characters, concepts, to remember. It is very difficult to teach the entire religion in a five minute YouTube video, the preferred format for spiritual growth for Millenials.<br><br>Traditional religion requires too much work, so-called spirituality is abstract, loose and simple for a feeble mind to understand. Spirituality also has no strictly sense of morality, more a loose suggestion. This allows for the degeneracy in behaviour and thought that we are all brainwashed to relish and worship.","filename":"1492460288406","ext":".png","w":1024,"h":1544,"tn_w":82,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493807424709,"time":1493807424,"md5":"76D+6QwkZNeACFGU5SY9jw==","fsize":3512793,"resto":123897823,"id":"6QrRAJxu","country":"GB","m_img":1,"country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123898554,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)06:30:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123897823\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123897823<\/a><br><br>Spirituality seems more open, less strict, easier to &quot;follow&quot;, I come from Ukraine, lots of people there specially older people were pretty hardcore about religion, while in some ways it is very good, because I feel that it makes people more soulful and know right and wrong, on the other side it can be tiring to hear lots of superstitious bullshit.

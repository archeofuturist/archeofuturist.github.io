After the destruction of the British Empire in WW2, we promptly became part of the United Nations and NATO. We have been pro every global initiative ever since. We opened our country to non-British immigration in the 70s. If you have the merits, you can come live here. Otherwise, fuck off. Refugees are used to score political points, but they are numerically insignificant. <br><br>Canada is the quintessentially globalist nation. We were created for and by globalism. We have an anti-populist, internationalist, hyper-federalist system of government that limits democracy and basically makes the Prime Minister a dictator if they have a majority government. We have always been pro-free trade, pro-low tax, and pro-open ports. We&#039;ve also always been monarchist elitists with an ingrained disdain for plebs. <br><br>Our country is magnificent and it&#039;s one of the top 10 freest countries. You wish you were born here, but you weren&#039;t. God bless globalism, god save the Queen, and god bless Canada. <br><br>p.s.

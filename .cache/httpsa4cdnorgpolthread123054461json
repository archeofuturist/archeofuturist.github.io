A police-operated drone with a camera swoops in to assess the situation and determines he is armed and dangerous.<br><br>The man is coaxed to surrender by a SWAT team, but his posturing suggests he is about to shoot. As a final resort, the drone \u2014 toting a firearm \u2014 hits the suspect. He is neutralized.<br><br>The way some lawmakers in Connecticut see it, weaponized drones represent a future for policing \u2014 and could be a necessary option in moments when lives are at stake. That&#039;s why a bill making its way through the state legislature would be the first in the nation to explicitly allow police to add lethal weapons to drones.<br><br>The bill, H.B. 7260, moved overwhelmingly out of the Judiciary Committee last month and must pass the state&#039;s House and Senate before the session ends in early June. It&#039;s unclear whether this incarnation will go as far as the governor&#039;s desk, lawmakers say, after previous legislation on the topic failed to gain traction in recent years. Civil liberties groups are urging caution on the measure, citing concerns over privacy and when force would be used.<br><br>Regardless, the growing prominence of drone technology means ground rules need to be in place sooner rather than later for whether they can be weaponized and to what extent, said state Sen. John Kissel, a Republican co-chair of the Judiciary Committee who supports weaponizing drones. Lawmakers are continuing to discuss the bill.","filename":"drones","ext":".jpg","w":768,"h":768,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493310931232,"time":1493310931,"md5":"skjd0amQT2fktzdcZDvEtg==","fsize":52332,"resto":0,"id":"Cecoj4M1","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"do-weaponized-police-drones-violate-the-nap","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":123055706,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)12:46:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123054461\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123054461<\/a><br>bump","time":1493311589,"resto":123054461,"id":"TaNbot5H","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

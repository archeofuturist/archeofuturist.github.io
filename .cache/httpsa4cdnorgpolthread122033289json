Living in a small community is what people are made for. We are not yet psychologicly ready for a global enviroment. Small communities ensure feelings of inclusion and purpose, as scarcity of people means everyone has something to do to keep it running. In such small communities, capitalism is simply impossible and impractical. Hiring people, or private ownership of things makes no sense because there may be just 3 or four hammers for the entire commune, its easier to just share most property, maybe aside from homes, but this again - since its a small community its going to b close knit, most will know eachother like family there, so objections will pass. The national or otherwise unified part is simply to keep the community from dividing, from having trouble to cooperate. Its easier to work with people you feel a natural connection to, be it through your ethnic identity, culture, or maybe even just ideology (ideally all three or atleast two depending on your ideology). It also must almost neccesarily be a direct democracy, as the commune wouldnt be big enough to elect officials, and most likely unified enough (if all checkboxes on the unity are covered) to differ in opinon enough for officials to exist. Ofcourse, you could vary this by making a council of more elder members who &quot;have more experience&quot; or have a monarchy of sorts, but i think such a community would be too small for a monarchy or any authoritarian system.<br><br>Its not even a unrealistic ideology. Such a commune can be established RIGHT NOW. The commune would simply have to have a net produce of some type of good to pay the local tax, and provide resources it cannot produce by itself.","filename":"images (6)","ext":".jpg","w":253,"h":199,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":196,"tim":1492717820120,"time":1492717820,"md5":"F5iqgcib6HNIWy6XOnxDXw==","fsize":10057,"resto":0,"id":"s+54q0mO","country":"PL","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-ascendencepilled-ideology","country_name":"Poland","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

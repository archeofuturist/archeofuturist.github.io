I didn&#039;t want to ruin anything I had and told her that I was a liberal.<br><br>It was depressing, she called them undatable, unintilectual lardasses, I just stood there while she told me that I would likely die alone because of what I believed.<br>She brought up some crap statistics such as &#039;90% of liberals are scientists you know, you don&#039;t want to be caught like an idiot if they were to think you were a conservative&#039;<br><br><br>The question is, how do you cope with life?

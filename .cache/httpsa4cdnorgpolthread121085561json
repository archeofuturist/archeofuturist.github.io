But even then, what does Trump see as a prize in Syria if he backs the sunni-backed jihadi rebels?","filename":"1485270504996","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":563,"tn_w":222,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492190339654,"time":1492190339,"md5":"doWD1lDgSdAVP5WtIfyuuA==","fsize":77903,"resto":0,"id":"FesSwuRC","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"what-is-so-important-about-the-syrian-civil-war","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":121086842,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)13:30:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121085561\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121085561<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Not realizing Jews hate assad and Trump has like 50 jews on his team.<\/span><br><br>It&#039;s fucking obvious why we have been supporting &quot;moderate&quot; rebels.","time":1492191002,"resto":121085561,"id":"n0F\/m3Bs","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

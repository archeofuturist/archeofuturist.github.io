The people here are passionate about maintaining it. And after being here I can say from my own perspective that the niggers here are smarter than niggers in America. I have yet to see anyone with a victim mentality. Anywho any added meme magic from fellow anons would be much appreciated.","filename":"image","ext":".jpg","w":480,"h":680,"tn_w":176,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493496016211,"time":1493496016,"md5":"oMqmpGqYzumbvPDMbwj35Q==","fsize":62699,"resto":0,"id":"UpH0Wjr+","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"bahamas-election","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":1,"unique_ips":3},{"no":123374704,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)16:08:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123373731\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123373731<\/a><br><br>I love artillery.

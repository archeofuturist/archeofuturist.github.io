According to Gleb Pavlovsky, a former Kremlin advisor, Medvedev\u2019s strategic stance has dramatically weakened. He is unlikely to keep his prime minister post after Putin\u2019s re-election in March 2018. This will put an end to his long-term political ambitions.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;According to The Moscow Times\u2019 sources, Vladimir Putin will most likely announce his presidential bid next fall. Few doubt that he will begin his fourth and, supposedly, final presidential term with a new government.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;Former finance minister Alexei Kudrin, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin and the president\u2019s representative in the Far East, Yuri Trutnev, all have better chances,\u201d says Minchenko.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The choice will be less about name than reputation. Putin will have to pick someone from one of two categories, says Pavlovsky: either a prime minister \u201cfor the elite,\u201d or a prime minister \u201cfor the nation.\u201d In the Russian context, these are fundamentally opposite political directions. The former would mean relying on a liberal-minded politician close to economic circles, but with little popularity among the masses. The latter would be a well-known \u201csilovik,\u201d a representative of the military or national security establishment.<\/span><br><br>This means Navalny actually won.

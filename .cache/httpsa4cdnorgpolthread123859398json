Just a couple of girls on the side. Men did not share their wives\/gf&#039;s. Men did not seek out sex that included another man for 3sums. The fantasy was 1 man\/2 females\/no relatives.<br>What happened to men since then?<br>Why didnt this change happen to women?<br>Where are the threads from women seeking out a female to pleasure their husbands while they watch? Where are the female cucks? Where are the females confessing they want wincest with their brothers? Where are the threads from females bragging about the BBC they just nailed? Where are the threads from FTM trap lovers? Where are the FTM Traps bragging about how they fooled a girl last night? That she never realized the truth?<br> It seems these major social changes have happened to men but not women.<br>Why? What are men doing that women are not? What exposures are taking place that women have not been affected by? Or have they been affected in different ways? Like how? Give examples. Then explain why these examples are so rare online. Like, yes they are doing it irl but why is there so little of it being expressed online?<br>What happened? Theories please. Tell me, what happened to men?","filename":"mcjuggernuggets-psycho-family","ext":".png","w":670,"h":377,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1493779069776,"time":1493779069,"md5":"PqNtlg2C8vYUXmC9NhMGmA==","fsize":340837,"resto":0,"id":"dqBvS+KV","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"social-engineering","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

racism doesn&#039;t exist.<br>When i was growing up I was given 100 fold the advantages the white children in my housing commission received, pre-school was payed for by the government, my school fee&#039;s were all payed for by the government, my dental and healthcare government, when i started to fall behind at school the government payed for a private tutor and even when I got a red dot atar I had no trouble getting into university, which the government payed for.<br>The reason most black kids fall behind is the fact they&#039;ve got useless no good junkie parents, like mine, and I managed to overcome it because of all the social welfare support I received.<br>At uni all my teachers went easy on me, almost like they were afraid of failing a half-cast, I likely should have failed, i wasn&#039;t doing nearly as well as other white students who did fail.<br>I&#039;ve received job offers simply for being aboriginal over other more qualified applicants.<br>At my second job out of uni I was always sent liaise at conferences simply because they wanted to show off their token aboriginal, and i fucking no this because I&#039;m not even close to the best worker, which isn&#039;t surprising because I&#039;m under qualified and only received the position because of my color to begin with.<br>We are given every fucking opportunity,the only thing we have to over come are our parents, and our own fucking community that attempts to keep us down at their level, it&#039;s some kind of sick cultural tall poppy syndrome, all while they blame the white man, who attempted to feed, clothe and educate us as best they could, even at the detriment of their own people.<br><br>Most of the white kids I grew up with are in jail at this point, because it was never racism holding any of us down, it was a culture of addiction and abuse and not 1 of them received the help i did to break free from it.","time":1493472167,"resto":123332465,"id":"2+bqaNB4","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":123333027,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)09:28:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"I&#039;m not ashamed of

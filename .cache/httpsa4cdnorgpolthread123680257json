Since values are established contextually, every man must judge for himself, in the context of his own knowledge, goals, and interests. Since values are determined by the nature of reality, it is reality that serves as men\u2019s ultimate arbiter: if a man\u2019s judgment is right, the rewards are his; if it is wrong, he is his only victim.","time":1493679627,"resto":123680257,"id":"IK3L7aQ\/","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123687511,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)19:00:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123687077\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123687077<\/a><br>I remember something about the water quality in Roscommon being fucked and one of the TDs here had organised to get money from the Govt. to invest in it but Ming caught wind of it before it went public and brought a load of shite quality water into the D\u00e1il to &quot;make his point&quot;.<br><br>The solution was already underway and he just wanted to have his face printed on it so that people remembered him shouting in the D\u00e1il and then the money magically appearing.<br><a href=\"#p123687292\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123687292<\/a><br>(((free economy)))","time":1493679634,"resto":123680257,"id":"Ze042coI","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"},{"no":123687610,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)19:01:27","name":"Rahman Neudels","com":"<a href=\"#p123685995\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123685995<\/a><br>Wrong.","time":1493679687,"resto":123680257,"id":"f2KGIQlE","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"},{"no":123687634,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)19:01:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"Now observe that a free market does not level men down to some common denominator\u2014that the intellectual criteria of the majority do not rule a free market or a free society\u2014and that the exceptional men, the innovators, the intellectual giants, are not held down by the majority.

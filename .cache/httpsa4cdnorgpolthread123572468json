I was at both the rallies in Berkeley and found the rally surprisingly empty without them. Chasing them out of the park was one of the best days I&#039;ve ever had, seeing them absent last Thursday made me miss the chaos of April 15. In many ways, Antifa helped unify the right. Normies swelled our ranks to help fight back after the Milo incident in February, and March 4 led to the rise of helmet-wearing followers of Based Stickman. At the most recent rally, more than half of the participants were wearing helmets or other protective gear, with some in full camouflage and riot gear. Without Antifa as an enemy, we may grow weaker and begin turning on each other. I can only hope that they return this summer, and we push back twice as hard.","filename":"1280px-black_bloc","ext":".jpg","w":1000,"h":750,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1493609661636,"time":1493609661,"md5":"6\/zcc6AtfmQfkTAULlvI2Q==","fsize":237811,"resto":0,"id":"hggmvv8s","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"is-antifa-over-in-america-can-we-expect-a-summer","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":1,"unique_ips":2},{"no":123573174,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)23:41:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"ANTIFA is controlled opposition and so is the Alt-Right.<br><br>OP is a CIAnigger.<br>They want you Trumpniggers to become violent, just like ANTIFA. <br><br>You&#039;re better and smarter than this.<br>Don&#039;t forget the real enemy is the Jew.","filename":"antifa altright controlled op","ext":".jpg","w":960,"h":451,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":58,"tim":1493610071844,"time":1493610071,"md5":"eNBDSbWctawGU1HZC4h79A==","fsize":86371,"resto":123572468,"id":"y3O1Exa1","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

I&#039;m at the point where I still eat meat, but realise it is a selfish choice. As it stands right now, there is no rational reason for eating meat. Vegan diets are better for long term health. If the enviroment angle is how you wanna play it, vegan diets are more globally sustainable. Then there is the ethical side as well. I think the only cases where it is warranted to eat meat and it is not selfish is when you&#039;ve either hunted the animal yourself, or if it was raised as livestock on a small scale farm (i.e you raised it or your neighbour raised it etc). Also if you do not have the means to obtain nutritional profile from eating a vegan diet in your area (don&#039;t have access to a large food\/supplement store). Feel free to prove me wrong I am open ears. Also some other things, pls no appeal to nature arguments (I used to think this was the zinger against veganism but muh evoloution is a terrible argument). And no eating meat makes you a man meme. How the fuck is eating something that was raised by another man in a sterile enviroment manly? If you hunted a great beast and you feast on it, yeah thats manly, but a farmed manly is ultimate cuckery.","filename":"AAEAAQAAAAAAAASQAAAAJGE0N2NhYjZjLWEzZTItNDFjNS05ODg4LWFmZTBlMzQyMmU1ZA","ext":".jpg","w":698,"h":400,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":143,"tim":1490925701635,"time":1490925701,"md5":"ViJk2hvmPQW+qPlEgRGdDg==","fsize":56164,"resto":0,"id":"D4pXUvVp","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"veganism","country_name":"Canada","replies":14,"images":1,"unique_ips":12},{"no":119003786,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)22:03:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"Meat is delicious and it has nutrients that make you strong","time":1490925817,"resto":119003574,"id":"Gnc1Q2xV","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119004081,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)22:06:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119003574\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119003574<\/a><br>If your going for the whole &quot; I want to be vegan because it is healthier, and I could use that in my life.

I think meat=nutrients is a meme, and really spouted by people who do not want to make the effort to look at all the alternatives. If you live in a developed country and have the access and financial means to a super market, there are many alternatives to supplement nutrients you can obtain from eating meat (protein et al). I think before, the appeal to nature argument would be a legitimate argument against veganism. After all, our body cannot naturally produce Vitamin K2, and it is not found in plants. However, if you live in a developed nation, you have access to supplements for this vitamin.","time":1490927243,"resto":119003574,"id":"D4pXUvVp","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]}

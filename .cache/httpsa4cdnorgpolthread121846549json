Ye we know islam is religion of piece and fucking fine because everyone is free to believe whatever he wants right, dear liberal cuck sven?<br><br>Why do u even consider religion as a single entity and then again, why do u in your tiny mind consider christianity as a single entity?<br>-Protestantism, Catholicism and Eastern Orthodox are quite different not only in theory but in the way they manifest in reality. For example Bulgarians has been under Ottoman rule for a hundreds of years, the church is what preserved the language and it is what united people against the Turkish Islam roaches. Wasnt it for the church we all would be turkish babies now, prolly with serbia and macedonia as well.<br>Judging religion for crimes commited by priests is like judging science for crimes made by people who use weapons(+ nuclear ones)<br>But what annoys me the most ( ye i am taking the bait) is that most often people who criticise religion( christianity is general) are people, ateists who have a more religious attitude towards science that a religious person to god.<br>Those people relate to science as if it is a god, they dont question, they say science said so, they dont question based researched, and in the end what happens is a leftie ideology spread in every sphere of the real world, be it media, academy or politics. So yeah good job blaming christianity? Does it force u to do anything? There even isnt almost any religious study in europe. not to say that even if there was it can be considered as studying mytho-history.","time":1492619833,"resto":121846549,"id":"8Q63cIkS","country":"BG","country_name":"Bulgaria"},{"no":121863475,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)12:40:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121862933\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121862933<\/a><br>Allah Akbar :^)","time":1492620050,"resto":121846549,"id":"zli9sxfZ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

You can&#039;t be redpilled without having someone offer you the pill first, y&#039;know? <br>What you gotta realize though is that the first redpills the site was dropping were actually in favor of liberalism and not conservatism. I mean sure the grand majority of the site was still predominately calling each other niggers and fags with every other post, but even then the site was generally much more blue than red. I mean shit, jew jokes were common back then but legitimate antisemitism was nowhere near the levels of today.<br> <br>What a lot of people fail to realize is that this site, and the majority of oldfags in my experience, are counter-culture before anything else. The entire time Bush was in office this site was more-or-less against Republicans since they were the ones that were telling them what they can and couldn&#039;t do. It was the Christian moralfags parading around trying to censor everything for the sake of whatever bullshit they came up with that week.<br><br>Once Obama and the Democrats returned to power and they became the ones policing morality (and the censorship that comes with it), the tone of site started to shift against them and towards conservatism. It was a slow going, but it snowballed faster and faster as liberal policy got more and more controlling and restrictive in the eyes of the site&#039;s userbase and it became less and less popular to be a conservative irl. It wasn&#039;t really until SJWs started to appear and attempt to police and &quot;correct&quot; everything that they found &quot;problematic&quot; that most anons really went hard conservative to fight them.<br><br>I think in the end most anons just want to be left alone with other anons without any outside influence affecting them. I think the only reason most of 4chan hasn&#039;t turned on Trump is because he&#039;s still generally unpopular in the MSM. As soon as he consolidates power and SJWs die off I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if this site shifts towards blue again.","filename":"1489788931348","ext":".png","w":240,"h":350,"tn_w":85,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493314384617,"time":1493314384,"md5":"6\/5sZtlcMpzz5yDulWKlWA==","fsize":95098,"resto":123054947,"id":"O3LgLfQV","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123061193,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)13:33:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123059912\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123059912<\/a>","filename":"42be4aef-36a8-a182-1851172","ext":".jpg","w":400,"h":365,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":114,"tim":1493314430471,"time":1493314430,"md5":"OnKL3\/D5S4C5l1BuRc2MXQ==","fsize":19986,"resto":123054947,"id":"Ca9dFJee","country":"CL","country_name":"Chile"},{"no":123061341,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)13:34:59","name":"OP","com":"<a href=\"#p123054947\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123054947<\/a><br>MOSHI MOSHI JESUS DESU","time":1493314499,"resto":123054947,"id":"E3QdDyMM","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":123061729,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)13:37:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123054947\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123054947<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;4chan<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Try and figure out who&#039;s been here the longest <\/span><br><br>Honestly, just neck yourself nigger.","time":1493314676,"resto":123054947,"id":"1+FdNala","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123061821,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)13:38:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123054947\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123054947<\/a><br>I miss having a pirate flag, but I like being able to identify non-Americans I guess.","filename":"Gerald drops wisdom","ext":".jpg","w":620,"h":427,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":86,"tim":1493314728416,"time":1493314728,"md5":"MRbQoZ65xT5uaxSLGZXO\/w==","fsize":78451,"resto":123054947,"id":"C+DsiFQR","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123061980,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)13:40:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"ROFLMAO considering \/2012 to be oldfags.. jesus christ.<br><br>back in my day \/2008, we&#039;d be considered newfags.","time":1493314809,"resto":123054947,"id":"jl8sain6","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123062097,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)13:41:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123061087\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123061087<\/a><br>I am looking forward to the atmosphere that surrounds republican rule once again.

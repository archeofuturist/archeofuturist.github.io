This is very unlikely. First of all, Congress has repeatedly enacted Homeland Security appropriations bills that instructed the president to \u201cprioritize the identification and removal of aliens convicted of a crime by the severity of that crime.\u201d Second, while it is possible that Trump could ignore this, he has stated that he will indeed continue to prioritize criminals (one Trump advisor has suggested that immigrants arrested for, but not yet convicted of, serious offenses would also be prioritized). Third, Trump\u2019s vague promise to \u201cwork something out\u201d implies at least some unwillingness to go out of his way to deport Dreamers. Fourth, Trump\u2019s unrealistic vow to deport 2 million criminals makes it unlikely he will waste precious resources on low priority, non-criminal cases. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;At the other extreme, the Trump administration could continue the current priorities for removal and allow current recipients of DACA to use their EADs until they expire, while not accepting new applications or renewals.

What is love exactly? It&#039;s great when you&#039;re feeling giddy about your new relationship, but the #1 breaker of relationships is<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I&#039;M NOT IN LOVE ANYMORE<\/span><br>This is the key to what I&#039;m getting at. <br><br>With divorce being legal the only things keeping couples together are: being stuck by circumstance, and the free will of love. Love is described as all these tremendously great feelings towards your partner, and we hear all the time in media that if you don&#039;t love somebody then you should break up with them.<br><br>How many &quot;relationships&quot; have you of the normie stock had so far? 3? 5? 10?

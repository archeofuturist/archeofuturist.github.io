Then a new text wrote itself in there:<br><br>&quot;Wenn jemand die Sorgen der Bev\u00f6lkerung ernst nimmt, dann unsere Regierung. Schenken wir ihr unsere Treue, unser Vertrauen!&quot;<br><br>In english: <br><br>&quot;If anyone takes the worries of our populus seriously, it&#039;s our government. Let&#039;s give them our loyalty, our trust!&quot;<br><br>Has anyone else experienced this shit?

I swear this was not the case not long ago. Has something changed? Because I swear it was Trump supporters telling non-Trump supporters to go back to Riddit not long ago, but now it seems the narrative has flip flopped. Is this a revamped shilling tactic and people are falling for it? I&#039;m confused. I haven&#039;t been called r\/The_Donald until just recently over my opinions, even when I was critical of Trump&#039;s decision to strike Syria. I want to believe there is no Shareblue invasion just like the rest of you guys, but I&#039;m convinced something&#039;s up. Help me connect the dots. I don&#039;t know who&#039;s Jewing who anymore.","filename":"hmm","ext":".jpg","w":590,"h":578,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":244,"tim":1491610220910,"time":1491610220,"md5":"L\/ZWxu+Oai8Ou+4jhp5Ixg==","fsize":30201,"resto":0,"id":"koyCjOJ3","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"why-has-there-been-so-many-accusations-at","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

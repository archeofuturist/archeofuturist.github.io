Jack Dunn, of Porth in Rhondda Cynon Taf, Wales, was sent to Royal Glamorgan Hospital on April 7 by GPs at a surgery near his home after they diagnosed a suspected appendicitis.<br><br>But even though the teenager was unable to walk due to the excruciating pain, he was sent home from A&amp;E that day. It has been claimed that he was not given any medication or any tests were run. His family put him to bed and periodically checked on him but when his father, Kieron, went to see him at 11pm that evening, he found his son had died.<br><br>Lisa Dobbs, a family friend, said Jacks death had been &#039;devastating&#039; for everyone. She added: &#039;Jack was in so much pain he couldn&#039;t even walk across the road to the doctor&#039;s surgery. His mum had to drive him there and they sent him straight to hospital. &#039;When they got home she put him in her bed because all parents know that sleep is the best thing when children are ill. &#039;They kept checking on him, but when his dad went up to check about 11pm, he had passed away.&#039;<br><br>Now friends have set up a JustGiving fundraising page to help Kieron, Jack&#039;s mother Claire, sister Taylor, 23, brother Callum, 19, and younger brother Jamie, 10. A total of \u00a3524 has been raised so far.","filename":"Royal_Glamorgan_Hospital","ext":".jpg","w":633,"h":315,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":124,"tim":1492432900915,"time":1492432900,"md5":"BTLXfthh8Ifc08YFca4nTw==","fsize":38483,"resto":0,"id":"yZEOZxLh","country":"AU","bumplimit":1,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"kid-got-sick-went-to-uks-nhs-hospital-kicked-back","country_name":"Australia","replies":337,"images":54,"unique_ips":177,"tail_size":50},{"no":121521265,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)08:44:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"Sucks dude.

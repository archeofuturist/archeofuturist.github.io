Those members who don&#039;t pay should be sanctioned and forced to pay, or removed from the alliance.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; B-B-BUT WHAT ABOUT RUSSIA!<\/span><br><br>Let&#039;s say the roles were switched and Russia was the leader of the West and Russia was the leader of NATO. Do you honestly think Russia would leave the largest, most powerful alliance in human history just because a handful of cucks won&#039;t pay 2%? No. Russia would be doing exactly what we are doing.<br><br>Do you think Russia would fucking give a shit about having better relations with us if our positions were switched? No. They wouldn&#039;t give a fuck and they would squeeze out balls till we comply. That&#039;s what we are doing to them, but don&#039;t act like they wouldn&#039;t do it to us.","filename":"NATO","ext":".gif","w":573,"h":573,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492391343781,"time":1492391343,"md5":"dTMF255plXUL6ggLVULuEQ==","fsize":14592,"resto":0,"id":"TRNmilBl","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"trump-nato-the-united-states-russia","country_name":"United States","replies":3,"images":3,"unique_ips":2},{"no":121454086,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)21:11:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121453766\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121453766<\/a>","filename":"1492118151556","ext":".jpg","w":867,"h":1024,"tn_w":105,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492391478124,"time":1492391478,"md5":"+nhfLjvzyjVKPy\/UKx4aTQ==","fsize":114193,"resto":121453766,"id":"hh4Tm6jf","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121455180,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)21:18:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121454086\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121454086<\/a><br><br>Nigger","filename":"077c2945fe3ee2073f478046aaaef576","ext":".jpg","w":480,"h":354,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":92,"tim":1492391908262,"time":1492391908,"md5":"IFM1TqX60PudaA7G9seYLQ==","fsize":42132,"resto":121453766,"id":"TRNmilBl","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121455975,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)21:24:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121455180\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121455180<\/a>","filename":"1492242066426","ext":".png","w":700,"h":700,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492392265513,"time":1492392265,"md5":"debA58qy6XEETrqewZc+RA==","fsize":240469,"resto":121453766,"id":"hh4Tm6jf","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

We still really don&#039;t know how it&#039;s gonna be adapted in here. We just know we have like 1 year left to buy rifles and magazine before the ban. What I will do is within the next 12 months I have to buy 10 magazines and at least 1 assault rifle to be banned. So when the ban pass I&#039;ll have2 choices : hide the guns ( not so hard to do ) or I can pray they will leave the gun to me be giving a special authorization for guys like me who had a gun before the ban.","time":1491773013,"resto":120328816,"id":"T9o8ldCu","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":120339284,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)17:23:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120338595\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120338595<\/a><br>I&#039;d best him with one eye , one arm and one leg .....","time":1491773020,"resto":120328816,"id":"PzhsTn10","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120339296,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)17:23:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120330030\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120330030<\/a><br>you&#039;re not white","time":1491773027,"resto":120328816,"id":"gzc3cU+7","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120339412,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)17:24:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120339271\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120339271<\/a><br><br>Or you can make miss LePen president and keep your guns + show the EU the finger.","time":1491773078,"resto":120328816,"id":"Vthv2lSw","country":"AT","country_name":"Austria"},{"no":120339456,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)17:24:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120339190\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120339190<\/a><br>Do you prefer ass ?","time":1491773094,"resto":120328816,"id":"PzhsTn10","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120339566,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)17:25:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120339200\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120339200<\/a><br>Just debunking that Amicans are somehow upstanding against their government.

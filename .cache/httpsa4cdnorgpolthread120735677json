They have always been used to adorn the female body in order to arouse the opposite sex and to intimidate those of the same sex and make them jealous. Dont look at those adornments any differently from fake blonde hair and fire red lipstick. They are the same thing. They are used to accentuate the female body and make it &quot;pop&quot;. It works really damn well, too.","time":1491988634,"resto":120735677,"id":"8Csw818B","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120736460,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)05:23:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"Oh, and chokers.

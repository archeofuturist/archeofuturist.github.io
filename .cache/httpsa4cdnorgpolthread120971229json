The punishments for these crimes are seen as divinely ordained and cannot be changed by humans. These include 100 lashes or stoning to death as punishment for adultery; 80 lashes for false accusation of adultery; amputation of limbs for theft; 40 or 80 lashes for drinking alcohol; imprisonment, amputation or death (by crucifixion in serious cases) for highway robbery; and the death penalty for apostasy from Islam. Methods of execution for apostasy can include decapitation, crucifixion, burning, strangling, drowning, impaling, and flaying. Apostates are denied a decent burial after their deaths, and the Muslims who participate in killing them are promised an eternal reward in paradise.<\/span>","time":1492122296,"resto":120971229,"id":"L\/1w6zPs","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120973908,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)18:27:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"I wonder if we&#039;ll ever know what happened to her.","time":1492122459,"resto":120971229,"id":"CtWOmYUK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120976155,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)18:45:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120973528\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120973528<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Judge Salaam wrote a landmark decision defending the rights of non-biological parents in same-sex partnerships to seek custody or visitation<\/span>","time":1492123500,"resto":120971229,"id":"T7IEaoC4","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120977682,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)18:56:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"Oooh Nooo<br><br>That sucks.","time":1492124189,"resto":120971229,"id":"7UKnCt\/H","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":120977903,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)18:58:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120971229\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120971229<\/a><br>uh, guys... why did trump do it","time":1492124301,"resto":120971229,"id":"fSqVgNiP","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

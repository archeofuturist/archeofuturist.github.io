South Island is like 90% white, whilst the North Island is like 70% and declining. Heaps of gooks, niggers and arabs have been pouring in through the airports. White NZers are leaving due to ever increasing housing prices\/high food prices with shit wages. It&#039;s election year this year, however the local equivalent nationalist party, whilst likely to become more powerful, is still not big enough to govern on its own. Australia is generally more conservative and better if you like to live in cities.","time":1493119955,"resto":122723784,"id":"m1VEaJZW","country":"NZ","country_name":"New Zealand"},{"no":122724462,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)07:33:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122723784\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122723784<\/a><br>a fucking medikit?","time":1493120005,"resto":122723784,"id":"WLXt8SmH","country":"HR","country_name":"Croatia"},{"no":122724508,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)07:33:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122723901\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122723901<\/a><br>nah it&#039;s pretty chill here anon","time":1493120039,"resto":122723784,"id":"d\/hHondu","country":"CH","country_name":"Switzerland"},{"no":122724510,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)07:34:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122723784\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122723784<\/a><br>-st","time":1493120041,"resto":122723784,"id":"fg64tDGP","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":122724666,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)07:36:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122723901\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122723901<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Switzerland<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;not the best country<\/span><br>flightless bird please.","time":1493120165,"resto":122723784,"id":"Auc4Fceo","country":"CH","country_name":"Switzerland"},{"no":122725193,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)07:43:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122724666\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122724666<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Digits from Hell.<\/span><br>CHecked.","time":1493120593,"resto":122723784,"id":"APHSUozZ","country":"CH","country_name":"Switzerland"},{"no":122725198,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)07:43:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122723784\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122723784<\/a><br><br>What did the Swiss mean by this?","filename":"composite-toblerone-v3","ext":".jpg","w":750,"h":500,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1493120598256,"time":1493120598,"md5":"LIGd6PPO9C0GbEH\/VVWBzg==","fsize":81379,"resto":122723784,"id":"im9\/+reF","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122725374,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)07:45:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122725198\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122725198<\/a><br>It means they saved 40 grams of chocolate and charge you the same price.","time":1493120754,"resto":122723784,"id":"iprPdHDp","country":"SG","country_name":"Singapore"},{"no":122725397,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)07:46:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122725198\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122725198<\/a><br>Less chocolate for the same price.<br><br>Enjoy the delicious gaps.","time":1493120773,"resto":122723784,"id":"9Y1n55G9","country":"SA","country_name":"Saudi Arabia"},{"no":122725438,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)07:46:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122725198\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122725198<\/a><br><br>BLACKED.","time":1493120795,"resto":122723784,"id":"L8FGFOiA","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122725577,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)07:48:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"Eh?","filename":"tmp_24231-14929162662021202670333","ext":".jpg","w":581,"h":400,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":86,"tim":1493120894251,"time":1493120894,"md5":"SEO2MAnCiWNOYh5X\/VRm8g==","fsize":100187,"resto":122723784,"id":"qIOqKPW9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122725612,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)07:48:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122725198\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122725198<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;implying toblerone is swiss<\/span>","time":1493120919,"resto":122723784,"id":"Auc4Fceo","country":"CH","country_name":"Switzerland"},{"no":122725748,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)07:50:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122725198\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122725198<\/a><br>Truly mountain jews.","time":1493121032,"resto":122723784,"id":"ps7bef7C","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":122726231,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)07:56:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122725198\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122725198<\/a><br>in swizerland it&#039;s still the same.

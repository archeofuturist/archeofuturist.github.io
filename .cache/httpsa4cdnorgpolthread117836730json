I have ublock, noscript and request policy running so they didn&#039;t get any ad revenue.<br><br>_____<br>You will never be able to enjoy the fun\u2014and easy\u2014question \u201cWhat\u2019s the answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything?\u201d again. Not once you\u2019ve seen Senator Ted Cruz start off the confirmation hearing of Trump\u2019s Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch, with it.<br><br>It\u2019s partly so that Cruz can trot out a pop culture reference in a way that has become de rigueur for politicians trying to show how \u201cwith it\u201d they are. Some pull it off. Others... do not.<br><br>Here\u2019s the difference: Congressman David Cicilline made a Stranger Things reference as part of a speech, using pop culture to illustrate a point. It was absolutely cheesy, but it served a purpose as a metaphor, and was made in his own words.<br><br>Meanwhile, Cruz brought up Hitchhikers as a softball non-question for a Supreme Court nominee. It\u2019s not just sucking up, it\u2019s a signal that nothing substantive is going to come from either party in this hearing, that \u201cHey, we\u2019re all such good friends we\u2019re just going to make jokes together.\u201d The obviously pre-determined reference also allowed Gorsuch tell a \u201cfunny\u201d story about how he likes to ask that question when he swears new lawyers into the bar.<br><br>Cruz is using a pop culture reference to make Gorsuch likable as a person, instead of investigating his character and abilities as a judge.<br><br>I would also like everyone to enjoy the irony of these two men quoting Douglas Adams, who was a) an atheist b) an environmental activist. I\u2019m sure that his words being read out and explained by Ted Cruz is exactly what he would have wanted.","time":1490221008,"resto":117836730,"id":"bxgw9ToZ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117838945,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)18:28:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117837156\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117837156<\/a><br>This is literally &quot;STOP LIKING WHAT I LIKE REEEEEEEEEE&quot;","time":1490221728,"resto":117836730,"id":"gnGp6OcG","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117839099,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)18:29:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Butthurt: The Article<\/span><br><br>People are awful.","time":1490221787,"resto":117836730,"id":"\/gFOI3qI","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

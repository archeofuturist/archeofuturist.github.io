I still have all of my family alive and doing well. I&#039;ve had multiple relationships, none of them worked out because I have no clue how deal with women, relationships aren&#039;t for me. I haven&#039;t been looking for a woman for years and I don&#039;t want to. I&#039;ve never actually been happy in my life but I seriously have not had a very bad life at all. I&#039;m not sure how I could improve myself more. I keep working and making money and trying to better myself, but nothing makes me happy, and seeing the world as it is and noticing all these things and focusing on them has not helped.

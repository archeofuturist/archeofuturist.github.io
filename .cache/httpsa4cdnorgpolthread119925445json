First, there are already UN observers in Syria looking for shit just like this to happen since at least 2014 when there was a gas attack that turned out to be staged. Second, the USA days prior said we will not be involved in Syria and Assad made key military victories. Third, in 2014 the UN observed the destruction of Syrian chemical weapon supplies (although possible not all were destroyed, but again not strategically advantageous for Assad to use them).<br><br>I think most likely what happened is Al-Qaeda (those white helmet guys are Al-Qaeda civil defense force) staged the attack (happened before) or Assad bombed the area and hit a weapons depot which released gas stored by Al-Qaeda so they used the opportunity to claim a gas attack. This is very probable because Saudi Arabia and Libya have supplied chemical weapons to Syrian factions, and chemical weapons like Sarin can and have been manufactured by crude terrorist home cooks. A bomb from a jet could hit a depot and trigger a chemical release, which would then be blamed on Assad.<br><br>It is possible for agencies like the CIA to determine if the Sarin gas used was lab quality (which means government source) or made in a shack (rebels\/terrorist). However this was never discussed or disclosed.","time":1491562974,"resto":119925445,"id":"3xabpWOz","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119930072,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)07:06:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119929643\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119929643<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;civilians<\/span><br><br>The guys in the white helmets helping the &quot;civilians&quot; are Al-Qaeda.

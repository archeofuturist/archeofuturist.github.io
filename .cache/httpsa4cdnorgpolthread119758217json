It benefits the Saudis, Turks, Qataris, Jordanians, and Israelis for us to go to war and overthrow their political enemy Assad.<br> <br>A strong departure from your campaigning, and a large reason for me to switch support to you from Rand Paul is your excellent argument that whatever our allegiances, we must stand for America first. It is wrong to condemn Assad for a chemical attack that is UNVERIFIED and especially when we know the globalists have used FALSE FLAG chemical attacks to blame Assad in the past. The reason America voted you in is to divert us from a path to war with Russia over Syria, as the globalists intended with Hillary&#039;s presidency. The American public is waking up to this globalist game of replacing dictators, thanks to your efforts during the campaign. Why now would you go back on your analysis and carry out the scheme we voted you in to stop?","filename":"7aCs65V","ext":".png","w":830,"h":546,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":82,"tim":1491495561815,"time":1491495561,"md5":"V+xsM2BnNQ92iZZO9wUUbw==","fsize":277068,"resto":119758217,"id":"BScWsAtS","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119758413,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)12:19:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;PART 2<\/span><br>These two events happening closely indicate that decisions are being made which work against the American people, and feeding into what Bannon has advised this entire time. Your greatest pool of supporters from young people comes from your internet fanbase, who are feeling betrayed by your distancing of Steve Bannon and inching closer to conflict in Russia over Obama&#039;s failed globalist war schemes in Syria. The video on facebook getting spread virally to millions showing kids dying is sick, but anyone using propaganda of dead kids is trying to use emotions to pass an agenda. Let&#039;s investigate the attacks first, and reveal who the Sarin gas came from. I urge you not to let emotions rule our nation.<br> <br>This report is a detailed analysis that concludes the 2013 Damascus suburb attack could not have come from Assad forces based on projectile and air resistance calculations:<br>http:\/\/www.voltairenet.org\/IMG\/pdf\/<wbr>possible-implications-of-bad-intell<wbr>igence.pdf<br> <br>I urge you to contemplate my letter and place trust in Steve Bannon.

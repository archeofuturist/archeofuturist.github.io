The few times it doesn&#039;t work out, the airlines treat you like a king. You usually get a seat on the first flight flown by any airline, not just the one who bumped you, at the same or higher level class. The Asian doctor would have been going home an hour or two later, period, with some added compensation.<br><br>But, he decided that he was more important than anyone else and knew more about what was going on than the airline. He assumed that he wouldn&#039;t get home (there are at least seven daily flights between Chicago and Louisville, his destination). He assumed that he had a right to stay on the plane after the stewardesses told him to get off. He assumed that people would think he was important because he was a doctor, when in fact every hospital has a ton of doctors on call. He assumed many things that were wrong, arrogant, and stupid.<br><br>Had there been a weather delay, he&#039;d be much worse off, because that would ground all planes for a time. Getting bumped just means having to take a slightly later flight, maybe on another airline, maybe in a better class, and definitely getting some compensation. <br><br>This guy was a dick. I hope he got some humility beaten into him.

I hate to admit it but it is seeming like he doesn&#039;t actually know what he is doing anymore and been bamboozled by GOPe. His move is SO SIMPLE, to denounce Ryan and the GOP for being incompetent, and that the elctorate wanted his policies, not theirs. Bannon knows exactly what to do, maybe its Bannon who was the brains behind Trump&#039;s political success? <br>Backing Ryan after this? Why? Seriously why?

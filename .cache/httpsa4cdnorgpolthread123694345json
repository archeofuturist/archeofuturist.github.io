To reproduce so they can live on. To evolve so they can live.<br><br>Gay people can&#039;t reproduce. Whether they choose to, or because they were born gay like most of them say they are (so they admit to being sick.)<br><br>Humans main goal is to reproduce. That&#039;s why the males are stronger, so they would hunt and gather food. The females would stay pregnant. If one male died in a tribe, it would not matter because one man can have unlimited children as possible. But one woman, can only have one child at a time. So you can see after this, that women are prized more over men simply because one man can easily replace another, but another woman is always needed to keep reproducing.","filename":"IMG_8879","ext":".jpg","w":400,"h":281,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":175,"tim":1493683071139,"time":1493683071,"md5":"u+tvU2o9o2t\/LMr6DHlW5Q==","fsize":31365,"resto":0,"id":"Iu7Lp7oN","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"i-used-to-laugh-at-alex-jones-when-he-said-gay","country_name":"United States","replies":41,"images":10,"unique_ips":21},{"no":123694892,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)20:02:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123694345\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123694345<\/a><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/6Ka5LtmlG5Y?t=8m44<wbr>s<br><br>&quot;Traitors to humanity&quot; -GLR (highly suggest watching clip in full but started near end when homos are brought up)","filename":"b24701cd2ac88619a6af3841b689a20d83e13f60197e0a1dc36e91a893d2b649_1(1)","ext":".jpg","w":798,"h":585,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":91,"tim":1493683371345,"time":1493683371,"md5":"BUCOkhaZeeNmzcY2cW8AOw==","fsize":230087,"resto":123694345,"id":"\/HHjWlL6","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123694999,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)20:03:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"faggotry is a mental illness that spreads through child molestation.","time":1493683424,"resto":123694345,"id":"PBzkWCko","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123695085,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)20:04:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"Maybe it&#039;s just people wanting to be in a relationship with each other?

I&#039;ve read a lot of arguments saying any child born here is granted citizenship and just as many saying if their parents are not natural born citizens they are not granted citizenship. Personally, I think the later makes more sense. Just because your parents waddle over here 8 and half months before you&#039;re about to be born does not make you a citizen and I think the founders felt the same way. I feel like all Americans are being cucked with birthright citizenship of foreign parents. Mexicans have some of the ugliest babies I&#039;ve ever seen pic related.","filename":"IMG_4186","ext":".jpg","w":380,"h":254,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":167,"tim":1493444720002,"time":1493444720,"md5":"di4PV55IP38sfzaGEwI1mQ==","fsize":40702,"resto":0,"id":"WasF0Fk7","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"anchor-babies","country_name":"United States","replies":5,"images":2,"unique_ips":5},{"no":123302069,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)01:49:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"Even if an immigrant get citizenship it should be revoked if they go on welfare, their kid goes on welfare, or if their kid is convicted of a misdemeanor.","time":1493444988,"resto":123301684,"id":"hSWoH+IB","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123302166,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)01:50:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123302069\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123302069<\/a><br>But what about the ones who run over here specifically to have kids.

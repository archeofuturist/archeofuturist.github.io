It could be both, but I know for certain you have to pick at least one.","time":1490809351,"resto":118804603,"id":"UjJdy37s","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118810324,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)13:42:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118807475\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118807475<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;conveniently drops the &quot;we should build more bridges instead of walls&quot; cliche during the elections<\/span><br>Fuck off.","time":1490809362,"resto":118804603,"id":"RyiW7iXf","country":"HR","country_name":"Croatia"},{"no":118810332,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)13:42:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118804865\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118804865<\/a><br>yeah...because liberals haircuts are so much better","filename":"Sjw+hair_df9c4d_5843518","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":640,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490809367761,"time":1490809367,"md5":"H33TV0pZdDe3r90bJAbeDw==","fsize":52842,"resto":118804603,"id":"MNK8lC2W","country":"NZ","country_name":"New Zealand"},{"no":118810447,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)13:43:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"Because religion can be used to opress peapole , like in my country country the king claims to have religious authority nd therefore is sacred , concervative partys also use religion in order to gain a false validity (Excuse my english), for example in my country the ruling party has a moderatly religious background and that makes peapole wanna vote for them just cause there good muslims, and the liberals in my countrty who actually use logic and analysis and povide real solutions dont ever go to power .

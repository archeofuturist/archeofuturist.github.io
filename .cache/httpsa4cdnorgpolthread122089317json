If blacks get sickle cell, and a white decides to downgrade their children&#039;s evolutionary status with interracial breeding, then there will be consequences. <br><br>The child will have a higher susceptibility rate for diseases\/disorders from both parents ethnic origins. Genetics are a dice roll no matter how you look at it. <br><br>I honestly think voluntary eugenics is the best way. Once all hereditary diseases for all people are eliminated in their respective in-groups, we can take a look at advancing the species with selective race-mixing - unless evolution tosses some obvious counter-arguments along the way. <br><br>Herd Immunity is best immunity; hands down. Whites don&#039;t need sickle because they don&#039;t live in areas where they needed to evolve an immunity malaria. If they are in those areas, it&#039;s their fault for being stupid and living in shit climates. <br><br>Good fences make good neighbors, and maintaining restraint in transplanting yourself\/family to foreign places is actually a healthy thing to do.

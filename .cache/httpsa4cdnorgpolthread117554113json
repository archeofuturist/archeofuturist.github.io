Sex is not very gratifying for the average non-deviant woman. To women, sex is mostly just a gift she gives to a man. Women are attracted to men the same way men are attracted to men: socially, not sexually. There are actually studies that show women find other women to be better looking than men. The orgasms some women can experience is really just a male orgasm. The clitoris is just a vestigial penis. The vulva is not related to the vagina at all. The actual vagina itself is nothing more than a birth canal. Embryos start off as &quot;sexually undifferentiated&quot;, meaning it has the parts necessary become male and female. The internal female parts degrade if a y chromosome is present to activate maleness, and the internal male parts degrade if maleness is simply never activated. The vulva is the embryo&#039;s penis\/phallus template. Men have useless nipples they will never use for similar reasons. The female orgasm is sort of like a pleasurable &quot;trick&quot; some women can get themselves to do.

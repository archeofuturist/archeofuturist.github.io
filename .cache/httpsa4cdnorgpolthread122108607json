Atheism is in decline worldwide, with the number of atheists falling from 4.5% of the world&#039;s population in 1970 to 2.0% in 2010 and projected to drop to 1.8% by 2020, <br><br>Real surveys and statistics say atheism is on the decline worldwide. Sorry atheists but atheism is not on the rise nor is it winning. It&#039;s still the minority and a declining one at that. <br><br>The Pew Research Center&#039;s statistics show that atheism is expected to continue to decline all the way into 2050 with a continued growth of religion. Other research also shows a huge surge in growth for Christianity in China which is currently the world&#039;s most &quot;atheist&quot; nation because of the atheist communist government suppressing religion, the research suggests that China will soon become the world&#039;s most Christian nation within 15 years. <br><br>This is simply history repeating itself: Christianity prospered in Rome back in the ancient era when it was suppressed and it still grew in the militant atheist soviet Russia when it was suppressed there only a century ago with the majority of Russians today now also identifying as Christian. Just goes to show that atheist suppression of religion still doesn&#039;t stop religion.<br><br>Sources for the legion of whiny \/Redditor\/ fedoras that will no doubt show up it this thread:<br><br>http:\/\/www.pewforum.org\/2015\/04\/02\/<wbr>religious-projections-2010-2050\/<br>http:\/\/www.pewforum.org\/2012\/12\/18\/<wbr>global-religious-landscape-unaffili<wbr>ated\/<br>http:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/news\/wor<wbr>ldnews\/asia\/china\/10776023\/China-on<wbr>-course-to-become-worlds-most-Chris<wbr>tian-nation-within-15-years.html<br>http:\/\/masterrussian.com\/russia\/fac<wbr>ts.htm","filename":"E03D48E5-8C5F-4349-BC2D-CDB7F5D3B7F8","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":819,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":199,"tim":1492757623333,"time":1492757623,"md5":"kCgMrJA19o2yCW7FiQWNug==","fsize":142136,"resto":0,"id":"9TSd5qvL","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"atheism-is-the-fastest-shrinking-religion-in-the","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":5,"images":0,"unique_ips":5},{"no":122108824,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)02:56:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Atheism<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Religion<\/span><br><br>That invalidates all that wall of text","time":1492757776,"resto":122108607,"id":"PDSy\/IPc","country":"BA","country_name":"Bosnia and Herzegovina"},{"no":122109152,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)03:00:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122108824\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122108824<\/a><br><br>Bet you wouldn&#039;t go into atheist church and say that, it&#039;s all these fedoras have. <br><br>http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/magazine-<wbr>21319945<br><br>Also,<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;atheist church<\/span><br><br>Imagine the smell...","time":1492758040,"resto":122108607,"id":"9TSd5qvL","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122109317,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)03:02:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Christians<\/span><br>People who worship a sand nigger jew?<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Tipsfedora.exe<\/span>","time":1492758159,"resto":122108607,"id":"+wSTtj6R","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122110655,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)03:22:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"So much text so little proof of God&#039;s existence<br>Saged","time":1492759369,"resto":122108607,"id":"agzPboPD","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122110703,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)03:23:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122109317\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122109317<\/a><br><br>During His lifetime, no persons were described as &quot;Jews&quot; anywhere.

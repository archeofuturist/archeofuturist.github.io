Bhagat Singh Thind, 261 U.S. 204 (1923), was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States unanimously decided that Bhagat Singh Thind, an Indian Sikh man who identified himself as a &quot;high caste Hindu, of full Indian blood,&quot; was racially ineligible for naturalized citizenship in the United States. In 1919, Thind filed a petition for naturalization under the Naturalization Act of 1906 which allowed only &quot;free white persons&quot; and &quot;aliens of African nativity and persons of African descent&quot; to become United States citizens by naturalization.<br>After his petition was granted, Government attorneys initiated a proceeding to cancel Thind\u2019s naturalization and a trial followed in which the Government presented evidence of Thind\u2019s political activities as a founding member of the Ghadr Party, a violent Indian independence movement headquartered in San Francisco.[1] Thind did not challenge the constitutionality of the racial restrictions. Instead, he attempted to have &quot;high-caste Hindus&quot; classified as &quot;free white persons&quot; within the meaning of the naturalization act based on the fact that both northern Indians and most Europeans are Indo-European peoples.<br>The court rejected this argument, holding that while Hindi-speaking high-caste Indians were indeed akin to white European peoples, they had intermarried too freely with the non-white pre-Indo-European populace of India, hence their present skin color. Because of the uncertainty this caused for scientific classification, the court decided to use a &quot;common sense&quot; definition of Caucasian that did not allow for the scientific arguments Thind made and did not classify Indians as white.<br><br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Unite<wbr>d_States_v._Bhagat_Singh_Thind<br><br>Only reason that shiskin got citizenship later was cause he was a WWI vet and we passed law that gave citizenship to any WWI vet regardless of race, it had a slippery slope effect as you can see under Aftermath.","time":1491507895,"resto":119777405,"id":"iPDAPGii","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119784057,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)15:46:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119783650\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119783650<\/a><br><br>Are you eluding to cyclic civilisations and the concept of yugs in the Vedas? i","time":1491508003,"resto":119777405,"id":"fKpySlkK","country":"IN","country_name":"India"},{"no":119784097,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)15:47:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119777405\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119777405<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\/our religion\/<\/span><br><br>get out Jew","time":1491508021,"resto":119777405,"id":"Z75963bF","country":"MW","country_name":"Malawi"},{"no":119784349,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)15:48:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119777405\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119777405<\/a><br>No, we already praise lord kek,<br>But I guess we could become Nazis, not a bad idea at all","time":1491508134,"resto":119777405,"id":"A1KnSODI","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119784398,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)15:49:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119783650\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119783650<\/a><br>Thats very interesting and somewhat dark.

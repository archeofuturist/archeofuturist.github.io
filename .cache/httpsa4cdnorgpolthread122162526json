During this journey, especially at the beginning, I would completely fuck up and do\/say some weird shit which would make people think I was a creepy freak. My normie\/alpha friends would just shit on my life to the point of me literally sweating from being targeted and being the focus of all the attention and ire of the only Alphas who ever tolerated me.

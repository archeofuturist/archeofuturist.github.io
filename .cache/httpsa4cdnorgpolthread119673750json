Like I said though, if I could do it again I would go with the airforce reserves (aka easy street) not active duty Army if I could redo it all.","time":1491437001,"resto":119673750,"id":"kmJTLN3b","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119676654,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)20:03:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119673750\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119673750<\/a><br>Only Dual degrees in STEM\/ECON and a CS degree. and you must graduate in the top 10% of your class. so for a few it is yea","time":1491437005,"resto":119673750,"id":"slxzwjL\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119676820,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)20:04:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119676640\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119676640<\/a><br>Kids fresh from high school don&#039;t know what they want to do.

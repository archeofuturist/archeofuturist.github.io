Through careful analysis, the internet has exposed a perhaps, not-so wonderful aspect of DC Comics\u2019 newest incarnation of the classic, girl-power superheroine: She has no armpit hair.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;While the moment lasts all of a millisecond \u2014 not to mention the reason we can see her armpits is because she\u2019s throwing a truck over her head like a ragdoll \u2014 it\u2019s a millisecond that has set off a heated debate.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In the continual race for onscreen domination, it seemed that with the release of Wonder Woman, DC Comics had finally pulled ahead of Marvel Studios, which has yet to produce a superhero film with a female protagonist. But, as Refinery 29 pointed out in a scathing review of the new trailer, the lack of body hair on the female warrior makes us wonder if feminism was swept aside in favor of achieving the ideal female aesthetic. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to believe that Wonder Woman, who has been on an island filled with strong women her entire life, is worried about waxing and then bleaching her pits,\u201d Refinery29 explained, \u201cThat is a time-consuming process and she\u2019s a little too busy training \u201810 times harder\u2019 with the Amazons so that she can, you know, save the world.\u201d<\/span><br><br>Was feminism always this retarded?","filename":"drumpf btfo","ext":".png","w":559,"h":509,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":227,"tim":1490516567794,"time":1490516567,"md5":"4kCsswqKZdp8i+oWziqu+Q==","fsize":286479,"resto":0,"id":"LpdgADdR","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"feminists-complain-about-wonder-womans-lack-of","country_name":"Canada","replies":236,"images":55,"unique_ips":109,"tail_size":50},{"no":118338492,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)04:24:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"Feminism was never logical.","filename":"1434243212667","ext":".png","w":1870,"h":292,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":19,"tim":1490516655935,"time":1490516655,"md5":"2VbyhaXGZHMeLydUGIDbPw==","fsize":75528,"resto":118338366,"id":"GB+v8jCy","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118338599,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)04:25:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118338492\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118338492<\/a><br>Science is all about disregarding feelings.","time":1490516751,"resto":118338366,"id":"MtLoGV8z","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118338671,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)04:26:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118338366\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118338366<\/a><br>I refuse to believe this shit","time":1490516809,"resto":118338366,"id":"fvNICJnw","country":"MX","country_name":"Mexico"},{"no":118338725,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)04:27:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"Feminism is cancer<br><br>They&#039;d have Wonder Woman as a 500lb Ham beast planetoid that looks like FUCKING chewbacca","time":1490516849,"resto":118338366,"id":"FxjKEpoz","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118338764,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)04:28:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"What about her bramble forest mass of pubes?","time":1490516886,"resto":118338366,"id":"BnxoJsMM","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118338858,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)04:29:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118338366\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118338366<\/a><br>Feminism is LITERALLY women hating other women for being prettier\/more successful.<br>This is LITERALLY all that it is.

Nearly every Wensday and Sunday I attended 2 hour masses. Granted at the time it was mostly because my school forced me to. However now I feel that regular Christianity just isn&#039;t enough. I find that by the time the youth reaches their teens they&#039;re either one whores or two cucks.<br><br>On one hand I want to maintain the beliefs of my family. On the other I want my offspring to lead a life that I can consider morally sound. <br><br>Although I&#039;m not leaving this decision entirely up to you guys I at least want to hear what you guys have to say. Whether it&#039;s from shit posting to genuine responses. If anyone has a experience with both please let me know.","filename":"IMG_1450","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":768,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1491287100322,"time":1491287100,"md5":"\/CDbbGRFFxmyAlN\/eVdhxA==","fsize":759445,"resto":0,"id":"aC8rMK+b","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"orthodox-christianity","country_name":"United States","replies":21,"images":1,"unique_ips":11},{"no":119440521,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)02:26:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"NO GODS NO MASTERS","time":1491287184,"resto":119440434,"id":"fKohoy0n","country":"RS","country_name":"Serbia"},{"no":119440548,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)02:26:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119440434\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119440434<\/a><br>Orthodoxy is infested with idols and has a false gospel.

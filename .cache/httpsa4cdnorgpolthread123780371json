If you give your kid a concussion it can lead to permanent issues with migraines-brother has them, but manages them with ginger pills- at a minimum and at worse could cause lasting brain damage. Should we wait until that does happen to do something? Continually exposing your kid to risk of serious harm is not alright. <br>That is just the physical stuff too. Imagine being a kid and having your dad, someone that you are told loves you and cares for you, throw you into a book case. He then justifies it with &quot;it&#039;s just a prank, bro&quot;. There is a certain level of cognitive dissonance that needs is formed by that. <br>The dad also says that these are all planned in advance. So he is pre-meditating and saying &quot;Yep. It&#039;s okay to throw my kid into a bookshelf for views on youtube for money&quot;.

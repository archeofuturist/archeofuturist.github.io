Im not overly nervous or anything as im confident enough in what i believe in and I hold enough knowledge on the current crisis Europa is facing to be able to speak on it.<br><br>Is there any advice and recommendations anyone would like to provide?","filename":"WGEAGLESYMBOLINVERTED","ext":".png","w":5934,"h":5282,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":222,"tim":1492995303756,"time":1492995303,"md5":"Cb2GRnFRquOZseHuBlbIoQ==","fsize":935416,"resto":0,"id":"TFa6BzGf","country":"NZ","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"doco-interview","country_name":"New Zealand","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":122519068,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)21:02:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122518331\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122518331<\/a><br>Talk less.

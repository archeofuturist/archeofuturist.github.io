Spook Shenanigans in the IC.","com":"With the direct\/indirect help of the Deep State, the CIA has grown in such power in the IC that it doesn&#039;t just want to be part of the IC, it wants to be the IC. Which is why it oversteps bounds in operations\/operating locations(FBI &amp; others have issues with them domestically &amp; others Internationally), tries to sabotage other agencies(such as the NSA) that are doing a better job then them, while making there own variants of the tech they have &amp; continues to be a perfect chess piece for Globalist interests.<br><br>The CIA has done so much shit, even it doesn&#039;t know how much shit it has done. But what the CIA is (in)famous for is toppling governments &amp; taking out Leaders. Which is why the Deep State is setting the CIA up to be blamed if anything lethal happens to Trump. <br><br>The reason why the IC agencies are so splintered with factions(Scattering all those splinters with wind would create tons of issues due to cells forming &amp; being painful to step on) &amp; don&#039;t like working with eachother is because of the Deep State playing them off eachother.(CIA does things that the other IC agencies then have to clean up or fight, Agency Arms Races &amp; Agency Wars due to agencies gaining more power\/tech then others, etc). The Deep State has no problems with messing with the IC by doing &quot;Divide &amp; Conquer&quot; &amp; also they have access to all the tech the IC has.(So its not just the CIA who can leave &quot;hacker&quot; finger prints, crash things &amp; have a &quot;how many dicks can we see a day&quot; competition with the NSA). <br><br>You really got to give the Deep State credit for the fact that they were able to create &quot;perfect conditions&quot; to make the CIA rise in power to later be set up, cause the IC to have so many internal problems they are not a threat to them, but instead be tools for them &amp; have the IC\/CIA be more concerned about Wikileaks then the Deep State that wants to take over the IC and overthrow Trump &amp; the Globalists who want to do a Coup\/Civil War(Arab Spring\/Ukraine style) in the US.","filename":"Pyramidz","ext":".jpg","w":1000,"h":667,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1490052802225,"time":1490052802,"md5":"VJfTrDSEn1je8f7y\/rdkig==","fsize":162883,"resto":0,"id":"uq+t\/hmX","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"knowledge-bomb-spook-shenanigans-in-the-ic","trip":"!!9O2tecpDHQ6","country_name":"United States","replies":193,"images":24,"unique_ips":69,"tail_size":50},{"no":117550794,"now":"03\/20\/17(Mon)19:33:34","name":"Anonymous5","com":"Remember This:<br><br>[The CIA is being set up\/crossed by the Deep State which is being set up\/crossed by the Globalists.]<br><br>Also consider how groups such as O&#039;s Shadow Gov &amp; the 7th Floor are also involved in this mess.<br><br><br>Meanwhile in the International IC:<br><br>1) The EU IC is being infiltrated by more Islamists than the US IC(Which has Muslim Brotherhood infiltration that REALLY should be cleaned out).<br><br>2) The Russian IC is wondering how they are going to get blamed for something again.<br><br>3) China&#039;s IC is stealing secrets &amp; Bootlegging other countries Tech.<br><br>4) Israel&#039;s IC is trying to stop arms shipments(Which the CIA &amp; NATO was giving to the &quot;Moderate Rebels&quot; in Syria &amp; Libya) getting to Hamas. <br><br><br>Also something to add to the &quot;Operation Mockingbird&quot; KB, OM is also used in things like TV Talk Shows(such as The View), Web Shows &amp; Radio. <br><br>The IC for all its problems, should draw the line(Make it a WW1 trench filled with enough landlines to create a new fault line) when it comes to Pedo&#039;s.

But it was the Grand Mufti, a Muslim, who manipulated Hitler&#039;s agenda into something that was never going to be. Hitler wanted a Jewish state, but it was the Muslims that told him not to. It was the Muslims that told Hitler it would be better to kill them than to relocate them.

You have people that start their career as civil servants in their twenties. They will work their way up the hierarchy for decades and will only stop because they reach retirement age. They are the ones who really run the country. Theoretically, they are supposed to follow directions by the elected government. Except... the country around them changes and they might decide that the newly voted in politicians are idiots and should best be ignored. Over time, with politicians coming and going, they might decide that the best thing to do is to not really follow directions.<br><br>This whole setup for how a modern state should work was already around before there was democracy. Like, if you&#039;d look at Prussia, that already was pretty modern and bureaucracy worked like you&#039;d expect in a modern state. At that time, there was a king that was ruling for decades, and when that king went into retirement his son was taking over. The state was not supposed to be able to change according to the will of the population. This &quot;deep state&quot; stuff was not a problem, instead was a feature of this whole civil servant hierarchy setup.

He would bring up typical anti-white nat arguments like &quot;IQ is all that matters&quot;, to which David countered with evidence showing that irrespective of IQ, diversity causes conflict. Singapore was suggested as an exception to this, but David pointed out that Singapore is only functional\/successful because immigrants are typically smarter than the native population, and Singapore is a pretty authoritarian society which is unlike the individualist, free society that a libertarian like Kraut or Sargon prattle on about. David also cited several papers indicating that there are genetic differences which help explain differences between races in overall cognitive ability, personality traits, and even their dispositions to collectivism vs individualism.<br><br>And something I liked about this debate was that the race realist (David) was not constantly on the defensive. Instead of looking weak and solely answering questions asked of him, he challenged Kraut to justify his position that after hundreds of years of failure, his ideology will somehow convince non-whites to get along with whites. The null-hypothesis is that the races cannot integrate and David gave plenty of evidence for this. <br><br>Here is a pastebin that David used as a reference:<br>https:\/\/pastebin.com\/mn1TRVPY<br>I suspect it was co-authored by Ryan Faulk (who calls in at the end of the debate to make a point and ask a question - he&#039;s the owner of thealternativehypothesis website).","time":1491136554,"resto":119193675,"id":"UWMU9yCS","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119195367,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)08:41:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119195007\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119195007<\/a><br><br>Oh god I&#039;m reading the comments in the video, it&#039;s a massacre of cucky ((((((((((((CIVIC NATIONALISTS)))))))))))))))) aka rebranded leftists from the 1990s.","time":1491136868,"resto":119193675,"id":"kU77Cu9a","country":"MX","country_name":"Mexico"},{"no":119195638,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)08:45:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;one of those &quot;anti-SJW yet anti-racist, libertarian&quot; types that make a living pretending to be edgy, like Sargon.<\/span><br><br>seriously fuck this faggot LARPing as a philosopher and all the other alt-lite talentless unoriginal e-celebs who capitalize on our memes and pick the lowest hanging ess-jay-dubbleyew fruit.","time":1491137106,"resto":119193675,"id":"wLO4McAe","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119195900,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)08:49:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119193675\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119193675<\/a><br>Kraut is not as regressive as most people are, he does a regular stream with Naked Ape called &quot;The Western Front&quot;.

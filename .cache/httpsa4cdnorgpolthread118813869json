As bad as your gov is atm, your corporations are absolute shit tier and will bleed you for every shekel. Remember the Verison furore? I honestly think your internet companies will seek to throttle\/restrict\/ban sites like 4chenz, infowars and drudge before your fed gov would. Trump should know better, seeing how he rightfully rails against the biased media corporations. So why does he want to give them even more power (to defeat his reelection campaign and censor everyone else).

He&#039;s been on the receiving end of spying, real leaks (grab em by the pussy), and fake leaks in an attempt to embarrass him (pissing hookers). Why doesn&#039;t he see that this internet history law opens everyone (including him) up to this stuff legally? Why isn&#039;t he connecting the dots?

I guess what happened is that the Swedish government takes it&#039;s image incredibly seriously, so when they realized that a multicultural Sweden would never work, they gave up. immigrants were literally moving back to where they came from, then telling the other Muslims that Sweden&#039;s utopian society is nothing but self-made propaganda. Sweden is also seen as a failure by most people in the west. it&#039;s litrally become the rape capital of the western world. I think I would react the same if I were the Swedish government, to be honest. no matter how liberal I was. do you think Sweden will recover, or is it all lost forever?","filename":"sweden-islamic-refugees-009-01-800x416","ext":".jpg","w":800,"h":416,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":130,"tim":1492503983036,"time":1492503983,"md5":"WLke0ejoh69gYcPqP4rYBw==","fsize":53787,"resto":0,"id":"e0WpfP3O","country":"NO","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"swedens-future","country_name":"Norway","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

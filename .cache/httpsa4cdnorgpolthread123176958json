It&#039;s not a secret. ISIS and other apocalyptic cult branches of Islam believe in a final holy war between the forces of Islam and the infidel. In a prophecy attributed to Muhammad, the Prophet predicts the Day of Judgment will come after the Muslims defeat &quot;Rome&quot; at al-`Amaq or Dabiq, two places close to the Syrian border with Turkey. Another prophecy holds that Rome\u2019s allies will number 80. The Muslims will then proceed to conquer Istanbul (Constantinople in the prophecy).<br><br>You know why all these terror attacks happen before elections? Because jihadists WANT far-right governments in power so that the West declares a full blown total war with ISIS. They believe that if a true war happens, they will win because Allah is with them. This may sound insane but it&#039;s the twisted logic of their self-defeating cult of death.","time":1493375053,"resto":123176958,"id":"uWBllmAS","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123178947,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)06:30:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"Unless the attack is directly linked to one of the parties\/candidates I don&#039;t think any single attack has an effect on someone&#039;s vote.

I would put it a different way, they have financiers and donors. And I think a lot of those donors are actually people who either believe in their cause (Saudi princelets) or people who have something in common with them, or who want to use them to make money or whatever. But I think that the commanders and leaders of ISIS really do believe in the whole apocalyptic cult thing, or at the very least think they can benefit from spreading such an ideology and gathering men under their banner.<br><br><a href=\"#p123179894\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123179894<\/a><br>kek<br>The thing is, it&#039;s a prophetic cult, and the &quot;prophecy&quot; is so vague that it can be applied to anything.

There isn&#039;t really any &quot;winning&quot; here except defanging the jihadists and preventing them from having any serious influence. Of course everyone wants to do that, but everyone has a different opinion on how to do it.","time":1493376427,"resto":123176958,"id":"uWBllmAS","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123182723,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)07:17:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123178451\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123178451<\/a><br>We really just need to nuke the Middle East I think.","time":1493378234,"resto":123176958,"id":"27WwfBp+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

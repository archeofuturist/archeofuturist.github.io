It&#039;s not a secret. ISIS and other apocalyptic cult branches of Islam believe in a final holy war between the forces of Islam and the infidel. In a prophecy attributed to Muhammad, the Prophet predicts the Day of Judgment will come after the Muslims defeat &quot;Rome&quot; at al-`Amaq or Dabiq, two places close to the Syrian border with Turkey. Another prophecy holds that Rome\u2019s allies will number 80. The Muslims will then proceed to conquer Istanbul (Constantinople in the prophecy).<br><br>You know why all these terror attacks happen before elections? Because jihadists WANT far-right governments in power so that the West declares a full blown total war with ISIS. They believe that if a true war happens, they will win because Allah is with them. This may sound insane but it&#039;s the twisted logic of their self-defeating cult of death.","time":1493375053,"resto":123176958,"id":"uWBllmAS","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

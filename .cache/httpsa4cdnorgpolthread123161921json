But it was even more of a present to Sanders, who was able to build his insurgent campaign while the full scrutiny of the national media was diverted elsewhere. Moreover, Trump\u2019s daily denunciations of international trade deals and American foreign policy echoed Sanders\u2019s message. The American electorate was angry with the political class. The recovery from the recession had been quicker for Wall Street and big corporations than for ordinary citizens. They both railed against a Washington establishment that seemed to reward political and financial insiders no matter which party was in power. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Trump took advantage of the increasing power of the Tea Party by appealing to the mistrust of government ingrained in lower-income, less-educated voters. He ran on nostalgia, adopting a campaign slogan\u2014\u201cMake America Great Again\u201d\u2014ripped off from Ronald Reagan, and traced the decline of the country to the mid-1960s. Though he didn\u2019t mention the Johnson era\u2019s Civil Rights Act, Voting Rights Act, or public subsidies for housing and health care, Trump\u2019s dog whistle was just the right pitch to attract the support of white supremacists and nearly all-white crowds of thousands at his campaign rallies.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;A similar dynamic was taking hold among liberals, who no longer found the \u201csocialist\u201d label affixed to Sanders to be so off-putting. In early August, he drew a reported 27,500 supporters to a rally in Los Angeles, where the comedian Sarah Silverman elicited cheers with her observation that \u201cBernie always seems to be on the right side of history.\u201d For both sides, Hillary was the perfect symbol of everything wrong with America. At times, Trump and Sanders would act as the right and left speakers on a stereo blaring a chorus on repeat: Hillary\u2019s a corrupt insider who has helped rig the political and economic systems in favor of the powerful.<\/span>","filename":"1493362266913","ext":".jpg","w":556,"h":426,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":95,"tim":1493363636098,"time":1493363636,"md5":"xEyF1J7GzwSH9AVP+7p2HA==","fsize":103999,"resto":123161921,"id":"WyMjsZMo","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123163745,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)03:14:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"I should go to Wendy&#039;s","filename":"TshNCZP","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":500,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493363657902,"time":1493363657,"md5":"Xtp+\/73SG880ROBEiG2rHw==","fsize":90410,"resto":123161921,"id":"Oh9VebuO","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123163765,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)03:14:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123163532\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123163532<\/a><br>Why has this happened?

At times, under the stress of an unrelenting feeding frenzy of reporters, Republican lawmakers, and federal investigators, Hillary and her advisers would lose faith in one another\u2019s judgment and competence.

That was killing her politically. When she was asked at a press conference in August whether she\u2019d wiped her server clean of the e-mails she hadn\u2019t turned over to State in 2014, she turned flippant. \u201cWhat, like with a cloth or something?\u201d she asked, miming housework with her hand before ending the session with reporters. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Even as she joked publicly about the imbroglio, Hillary was boiling over inside. She didn\u2019t think she\u2019d done anything wrong. In her mind, there was no legal prohibition against her exclusive use of a private server\u2014even though it ran starkly counter to the spirit of regulations designed to preserve government officials\u2019 correspondence. She was being treated like a common criminal\u2014or, worse, a traitor to the nation she\u2019d faithfully served as first lady, senator, and secretary of state. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Her antagonists were the same set who had come after her time and again during her husband\u2019s presidency: Republicans in Congress, big-money conservatives at the heart of what she had once called a \u201cvast right-wing conspiracy,\u201d and a complicit, if sometimes unwitting, media. She wasn\u2019t contrite; she was indignant.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Of course, Hillary should have been angry with herself. She\u2019d taken actions that could have prevented her records from becoming public during a presidential run, and the maneuver had backfired badly. But Hillary instead turned her fury on her consultants and campaign aides, blaming them for a failure to focus the media on her platform. In her ear the whole time, spurring her on to cast blame on others and never admit to anything, was her husband. Neither Clinton could accept the simple fact that Hillary had hamstrung her own campaign and dealt the most serious blow to her own presidential aspirations.<\/span>","filename":"18473897532825","ext":".jpg","w":510,"h":351,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":86,"tim":1493364959362,"time":1493364959,"md5":"6NDJxBydXQ+vSipdUDHCYQ==","fsize":19469,"resto":123161921,"id":"WyMjsZMo","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123165501,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)03:36:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123165223\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123165223<\/a><br>I was just givin you the old raspberry sauce m8. don&#039;t take my shitty jokes to seriously.

A lot of that came from Republicans, but it had a psychic effect on Democrats who had looked at her as the party\u2019s likely nominee. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Over the course of the summer, the confidence of party insiders had been replaced by a degree of paranoia that nearly matched Hillary\u2019s own outsize phobia. She was convinced that leaks of information had helped doom her 2008 campaign. In reality, the leaking and disloyalty were symptoms, not the cause, of the dysfunction in her first run for the White House. As long as she was seen as the prohibitive favorite to win the primary and the election, Democrats would fear being branded traitors or leakers. But if she wasn\u2019t going to be in a position to reward or punish them, they had no reason to worry about whether they were rated as ones or sevens on her loyalty scale. After the 2008 campaign, two of her aides, Kris Balderston and Adrienne Elrod, had toiled to assign loyalty scores to members of Congress, ranging from one for the most loyal to seven for those who had committed the most egregious acts of treachery. Bill Clinton had campaigned against some of the sevens in subsequent primary elections, helping to knock them out of office. The fear of retribution was not lost on the remaining sevens, some of whom rushed to endorse Hillary early in the 2016 cycle. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;This time, nothing was coming easy: her campaign was under fire every minute of every day.

But it was even more of a present to Sanders, who was able to build his insurgent campaign while the full scrutiny of the national media was diverted elsewhere. Moreover, Trump\u2019s daily denunciations of international trade deals and American foreign policy echoed Sanders\u2019s message. The American electorate was angry with the political class. The recovery from the recession had been quicker for Wall Street and big corporations than for ordinary citizens. They both railed against a Washington establishment that seemed to reward political and financial insiders no matter which party was in power. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Trump took advantage of the increasing power of the Tea Party by appealing to the mistrust of government ingrained in lower-income, less-educated voters. He ran on nostalgia, adopting a campaign slogan\u2014\u201cMake America Great Again\u201d\u2014ripped off from Ronald Reagan, and traced the decline of the country to the mid-1960s. Though he didn\u2019t mention the Johnson era\u2019s Civil Rights Act, Voting Rights Act, or public subsidies for housing and health care, Trump\u2019s dog whistle was just the right pitch to attract the support of white supremacists and nearly all-white crowds of thousands at his campaign rallies.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;A similar dynamic was taking hold among liberals, who no longer found the \u201csocialist\u201d label affixed to Sanders to be so off-putting. In early August, he drew a reported 27,500 supporters to a rally in Los Angeles, where the comedian Sarah Silverman elicited cheers with her observation that \u201cBernie always seems to be on the right side of history.\u201d For both sides, Hillary was the perfect symbol of everything wrong with America. At times, Trump and Sanders would act as the right and left speakers on a stereo blaring a chorus on repeat: Hillary\u2019s a corrupt insider who has helped rig the political and economic systems in favor of the powerful.<\/span>","filename":"1493362266913","ext":".jpg","w":556,"h":426,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":95,"tim":1493363636098,"time":1493363636,"md5":"xEyF1J7GzwSH9AVP+7p2HA==","fsize":103999,"resto":123161921,"id":"WyMjsZMo","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123163745,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)03:14:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"I should go to Wendy&#039;s","filename":"TshNCZP","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":500,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493363657902,"time":1493363657,"md5":"Xtp+\/73SG880ROBEiG2rHw==","fsize":90410,"resto":123161921,"id":"Oh9VebuO","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123163765,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)03:14:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123163532\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123163532<\/a><br>Why has this happened?

At times, under the stress of an unrelenting feeding frenzy of reporters, Republican lawmakers, and federal investigators, Hillary and her advisers would lose faith in one another\u2019s judgment and competence.

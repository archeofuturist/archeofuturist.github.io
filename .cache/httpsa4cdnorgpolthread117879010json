The water-to-cement ratio is the most important, as too little water will make the concrete mix difficult to work with, while too much will weaken the final product. This ratio is calculated with the following equation:<br><br>In this calculation, r is the ratio, qH2O is the quantity of water in US gallons, and Wc is the weight of cement in pounds. A ratio of at least 0.25 is required for concrete to harden, while values of 0.35 to 0.4 are typical for most applications.<br><br>Aggregate is also important, as it makes up more than 60% of a concrete mix \u2014 and up to 80% in some cases. Larger rocks require less concrete, which means less water is needed, and a stronger final product can be made. Aggregate is also less expensive than cement, so a higher percentage can lower the cost. Generally speaking, a good aggregate has a combination of rocks of many different sizes, with a specific average and maximum size; these stones must be clean and durable, and should not contain clay or other minerals that can absorb water.","time":1490244900,"resto":117879010,"id":"EasWSAPu","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117889923,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)00:55:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117883626\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117883626<\/a><br>ban building codes<br>fucking bastards telling people they cant produce cool things","time":1490244938,"resto":117879010,"id":"EasWSAPu","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117889939,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)00:55:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117889821\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117889821<\/a><br>Actually you might be right.","time":1490244951,"resto":117879010,"id":"nYZMMtTy","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":117889986,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)00:56:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117883647\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117883647<\/a><br>tons of ways to insulate<br>polyurithane with silvered papaer <br>etc etc etc<br>this is noo problem for capitalism","time":1490244981,"resto":117879010,"id":"EasWSAPu","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117890027,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)00:56:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117883923\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117883923<\/a><br>capitalism<br>fire all those goons<br>erase laws n regs","time":1490245004,"resto":117879010,"id":"EasWSAPu","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117890031,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)00:56:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117879010\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117879010<\/a><br>A lot of the problem is the cost of permits and having to pay for subsidized housing for niggers of you are a homeowner.

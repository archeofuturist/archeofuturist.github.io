Every time you hear &quot;dead putin critic&quot; remember that you are talking about a capitalist country, and the fact that there is any number of rich people who can hire someone to kill you. Given that &quot;Putin critics&quot; tend to piss off a lot of those, It&#039;s no surprise that some of them end up dead. Sometimes the investigation is dropped to avoid an insight between oligarchs and government, true, but such is not unique to us. We just get more coverage because anglosphere MSM get good ratings and investments out of portraying putin as a supervillian.","time":1493472003,"resto":123331956,"id":"TwCvi86O","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":123332612,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)09:22:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123332444\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123332444<\/a><br>are assassinations there easy or cheap or why kill em? they just spout out bs not lot of people will take seriously?<br><br>or what","time":1493472161,"resto":123331956,"id":"v3NIvcJa","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":123332681,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)09:23:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123332444\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123332444<\/a><br><a href=\"#p123332612\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123332612<\/a><br>or are oligarchs and other shady business men that have to deal with Putin&#039;s people to be able to do stuff just criminals?","time":1493472210,"resto":123331956,"id":"v3NIvcJa","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":123333077,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)09:29:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123332612\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123332612<\/a><br><a href=\"#p123332681\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123332681<\/a><br><br>Assasinations are cheap and easy everywhere where there is high level of common crime.

Atheism is in decline worldwide, with the number of atheists falling from 4.5% of the world&#039;s population in 1970 to 2.0% in 2010 and projected to drop to 1.8% by 2020, <br><br>Real surveys and statistics say atheism is on the decline worldwide. Sorry atheists but atheism is not on the rise nor is it winning. It&#039;s still the minority and a declining one at that. <br><br>The Pew Research Center&#039;s statistics show that atheism is expected to continue to decline all the way into 2050 with a continued growth of religion. Other research also shows a huge surge in growth for Christianity in China which is currently the world&#039;s most &quot;atheist&quot; nation because of the atheist communist government suppressing religion, the research suggests that China will soon become the world&#039;s most Christian nation within 15 years. <br><br>This is simply history repeating itself: Christianity prospered in Rome back in the ancient era when it was suppressed and it still grew in the militant atheist soviet Russia when it was suppressed there only a century ago with the majority of Russians today now also identifying as Christian. Just goes to show that atheist suppression of religion still doesn&#039;t stop religion.<br><br>Sources for the legion of whiny \/Redditor\/ fedoras that will no doubt show up it this thread:<br><br>http:\/\/www.pewforum.org\/2015\/04\/02\/<wbr>religious-projections-2010-2050\/<br>http:\/\/www.pewforum.org\/2012\/12\/18\/<wbr>global-religious-landscape-unaffili<wbr>ated\/<br>http:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/news\/wor<wbr>ldnews\/asia\/china\/10776023\/China-on<wbr>-course-to-become-worlds-most-Chris<wbr>tian-nation-within-15-years.html<br>http:\/\/masterrussian.com\/russia\/fac<wbr>ts.htm","filename":"1490142549767","ext":".jpg","w":608,"h":755,"tn_w":201,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491600066395,"time":1491600066,"md5":"gbLQR\/M\/TdWWLU+dYjIA+Q==","fsize":123410,"resto":0,"id":"ekX\/zODt","country":"PL","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"atheism-is-the-fastest-shrinking-religion-in-the","country_name":"Poland","replies":5,"images":4,"unique_ips":5},{"no":120026368,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)17:23:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120026012\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120026012<\/a>","filename":"1491503065249","ext":".png","w":1200,"h":650,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":67,"tim":1491600202622,"time":1491600202,"md5":"+oDg2STBz6otR0bL92X6bg==","fsize":329918,"resto":120026012,"id":"VSs04aWc","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120026394,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)17:23:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120026012\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120026012<\/a><br>quit it shill, nobody is going to give any money to you and your faggot kike-on-a-stick church.<br><br>reminder that pic related is literally OP","filename":"06Bevnn","ext":".png","w":687,"h":88,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":16,"tim":1491600211919,"time":1491600211,"md5":"4pWzQNhagyz7Df\/5gUmrpg==","fsize":14030,"resto":120026012,"id":"PUgbWlXz","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120026766,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)17:25:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120026368\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120026368<\/a><br>There is zero (0) evidence that a being in the sky that plays our lives like an RTS","filename":"12373240_766811230117432_6883641842194900631_n","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":480,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1491600353315,"time":1491600353,"md5":"wqATbv9yW9ta\/vJZXjgjgA==","fsize":60973,"resto":120026012,"id":"b\/y83\/wx","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120026819,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)17:26:08","name":"Anonymous","filename":"file_2","ext":".png","w":1324,"h":545,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":51,"tim":1491600368790,"time":1491600368,"md5":"LdIC0ykaK4vbqD1BmPBOnA==","fsize":47977,"resto":120026012,"id":"b\/y83\/wx","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120027297,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)17:28:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/news<wbr>\/acts-of-faith\/wp\/2016\/04\/21\/my-wif<wbr>e-and-i-are-white-evangelicals-here<wbr>s-why-we-chose-to-give-birth-to-bla<wbr>ck-triplets\/<br>OP is a colossal faggot as usual","time":1491600539,"resto":120026012,"id":"Q\/vop0DM","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

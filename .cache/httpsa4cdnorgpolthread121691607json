Cabins are cozy but its a lot of maintenance keeping it from leaking and rotting. It is wise to have 10-15 good acres in a remote area though. A solid investment, you will be able to retire early because you wont be spending as much. With a good cistern, well or spring you will never want for water. Solar power is economical and turn key now ways but hydro power is more reliable. Don&#039;t bother with wind. It costs to much to get it to work with batteries and solar right and tend to suffer mechanical problems. Wood gas is also a good intermittent source. A nice huge gen set running on wood gas is awesome for large power tools and motors.","time":1492527149,"resto":121691607,"id":"pQhiMYbB","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121692607,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)10:54:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121691607\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121691607<\/a><br>Is it really living off the grid when you have a bush pilot friend periodically bringing you supplies and food?","time":1492527256,"resto":121691607,"id":"2vxuE4IH","country":"BE","country_name":"Belgium"},{"no":121692828,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)10:56:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121691607\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121691607<\/a><br>This is actually called the dick pill<br><br>T.

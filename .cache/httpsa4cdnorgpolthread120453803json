I am NOT saying I support him or I think he would be a great president.<br><br>Lets face it. There&#039;s a good chance Trump is going to self-implode or succumb to the Deep State sabotage, leaving him vulnerable to lose populist support. He only won the election because the Democratic party was a dumpster fire and nominated the worst candidate in modern American history.<br><br>Cuomo is the perfect hybrid of Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton in many ways and can unite the Democratic party. Today, he just announced free public college tuition for middle class families in New York. Has done progressive minimum wage jumps and paid family leave. His father (New York governor, lots of political connections) was once a favorite to win the Democratic nomination, but declined to run and just passed away in 2015. I think Andrew will be feeling particularly sentimental about this fact and also it makes for a great campaign story. Additionally, he has connections in the MSM, with his brother working for CNN allowing him to gain favorable coverage.<br><br>WASP Hillary + Jew Bernie = Greaseball Cuomo<br><br>After the roller coaster ride of Trump, I think Americans will want some stability and pick Cuomo. He&#039;s liberal enough to appease the bernie wing and establishment enough to get party support. He talks and looks tough and alpha enough to win over conservative voters.<br><br>After Clinton&#039;s disaster, she will either be shoved to the side once her failing poll numbers start coming out, or end up running for NYC mayor. Bernie is too old and had his time. Liz Warren too shrill. Tulsi Gabbard, too inexperienced, would get ripped by establishment IMO.","filename":"1024x1024","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":698,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":170,"tim":1491840956046,"time":1491840956,"md5":"1aaFFkL2npwtJmA3NbhpQQ==","fsize":40663,"resto":0,"id":"darZWs2i","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"so-tell-me-where-im-wrong-here","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":120454209,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)12:19:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"His personality is shit and he has corruption scandals coming out of his ears.

It wants you to believe that these are your \u201clegitimate concerns.\u201d But as the craven svengalis of triumphant neoconservatism and the gurning spivs they stand behind try to scrawl their own ugly slogans over the pages of recent history, remember that it could have been otherwise. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Remember this, because people will try to erase it from the story. Brexit is happening because the people of Britain have been through eight years of savage and senseless austerity. If you take away all of the things that make community life possible\u2014not just the libraries but the youth centers, the after-school clubs, the parks and citizens advice centers\u2014if you do all that and then fix it so people can hardly even afford to leave the house, presuming they have energy out of their exhausting jobs, then communities

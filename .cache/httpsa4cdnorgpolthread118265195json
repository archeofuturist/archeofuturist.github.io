Oh, that&#039;s right. His first term isn&#039;t even over yet. In fact, it&#039;s only the first 100 days. Does not having the lead in the first 100 dyas count as a loss? Is that what you&#039;re saying? Because if you&#039;re saying that I can assure you that you&#039;re wrong. Why would you make this topic when the game is still on? Trump is still President right now and he has been the best President in the GOP for how many weeks now? He&#039;s playing one of the worst teams in the Congress who just happen to have a lead because they&#039;re feeding off the energy of defeating Ryan&#039;s bill. But you know what? They still fucking suck. Trump is one of the best fucking dealmakers in the USA, he went 13-3 last year and would of won the AHCA vote if Ryan didn&#039;t choke. Maybe you should shut the fuck up before you make retarded topics like this. You know why? Because you&#039;re going to be embarrassed when Trump wins and someone bumps this topic. Oh look at that, the Freedom Caucus just stepped out of bounds short of the 1st committee hearing when they needed to get one, just like the AHCA vote did. Are you a fucking drunk? Are you retarded? Are you autistic? You are a fucking idiot and you should never make a topic on this board again and I&#039;m fucking serious. I almost have a feeling you&#039;re the only guy making all these anti-Trump topics because you&#039;re an autist who doesn&#039;t like the team because they&#039;re good. Fuck you, be good at something in YOUR life and then maybe try to troll these fucking teams on the board, like I give a fuck. It&#039;s so easy to spot out your threads now, you&#039;re a retard. Always doing stupid shit like this. Why don&#039;t you try to be a good poster? Just for once? For once in your fucking life try not to make a topic like this. That&#039;s just you, you&#039;re always right at getting it wrong. Fuck you. You are nothing.","time":1490472350,"resto":118265195,"id":"MxKN0rUh","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118265304,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)16:05:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"KILL ALL

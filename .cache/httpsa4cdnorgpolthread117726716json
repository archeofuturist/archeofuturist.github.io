It hates me and I hate it back. Donation is not an option cuz she wanna keep this fucking cat. I tried several times to have a good relationship with the cat. Bought food, toys, agreed with the whole idea of sleeping in my bed and all I ever received back was scratches and bites. Help me to kill this cat, \/b\/. But I can&#039;t leave clues. No blood, no Poison, nothing that the fucking Vet can charge me. I was thinking about spin the cat in the laundry machine, but idk.

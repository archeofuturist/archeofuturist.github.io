It&#039;s a willing userbase. The trouble with \/tv\/ is that the bar for entry is extremely low, since everyone watches movies and tv, but only a fraction of a fraction of people care enough about the subjects to learn anything of substance about them. Hacks like Red Letter Media and the hipster blogger horde that control Rotten Tomatoes are to blame. Our culture has become hopelessly debased and it&#039;s the democratization of opinion that did it. Here I go combining \/tv\/ and \/pol\/ without meaning to. Armond White covered it quite well in an interview. Nobody troubles themselves to learn anymore because there&#039;s no immediately recognizeable incentive to.

How are the arts in your country? In Australia our government stopped funding decent projects 20 years ago, we make about 3 good movies a decade and we have no living writers worth talking about, and the ones we&#039;ve had in our whole history can be counted on your fingers and are barely even footnotes in the history of global literature.<br><br><a href=\"#p118063406\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118063406<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Bloom<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;controlled op<\/span><br>I don&#039;t think so. I sincerely believe that if it weren&#039;t for him there&#039;d be NO OP. He&#039;s it. Once he dies the resenters win, kids read Harry Potter in school and Shakespeare is an obscure historical footnote by 2100. He&#039;s still alive and I don&#039;t believe him to be an anti-semite hunter of any kind. He appears to have no beef with &#039;The Merchant of Venice&#039; and also I think he&#039;s just plain too autistic on the topic of literature to ever think a subjective thought on writing. Watch the interview. His mind is made of the words of dead men and he bleeds ink.","time":1490347774,"resto":118062556,"id":"LFiQAq3R","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"}]}

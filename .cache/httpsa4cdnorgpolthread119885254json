Yet for all his lack of political training and experience it was the life experience he gained in Europe that caused him to lead his country to a economic and social revolution by trying to bring Western success to Syria. Internationally he tried to avoid getting caught up in middle eastern politics by reaching out to foreign countries for peace and trade. Times were good and by all rights Syria was flourishing under the rule of this outsider, yet it did last as the same Islamist that had been hounding his family and country for years had returned. Emboldened by the collapse of order in the middle east, empowered by the spread of extremism, and armed by foreign governments, these jihaddis took to the streets and spread chaos. Western media and government&#039;s dog piled on him when the police shot back at goons with AKs, and they accused him of using poison gas on his people, a charge he would later be cleared of little to the knowledge of the general public. In the early days of the conflict he tried desperately to show the west that he wasn&#039;t some kind of monster but it didn&#039;t matter because he was caught up in a much larger political game.

Assuming the full destruction of the airbase (i.e. everything is gone and it cant be used) then we could see an attempt from the jihaddis to push forward and connect with the Homs pocket, or at the very least funnel personnel, arms, and supplies more freely into it. This could also mean that the Syrian government will have to dig in for a time and be more cautious until they can recover from the loss of air craft and personnel, which could lead to less important targets in the grand scheme of things being ignored (e.g. stopping banditry or some small village from being wiped off the map).","time":1491543460,"resto":119885254,"id":"x00JFCo4","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119892331,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)01:37:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119891416\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119891416<\/a><br>Redditors need to leave.

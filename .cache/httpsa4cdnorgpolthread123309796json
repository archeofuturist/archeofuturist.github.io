The shows have become full of bitchy little &quot;fuck you&quot;, attitude loaded - shit for brains shows where Mom and Dad are portrayed as idiots who just want to get in the way of kids havin&#039; fun, dont&#039;cha know. I post this - still feeling a bit shocked. I mean, Disney? Fucking DISNEY? But our little girl became addicted to the Disney Hanna Montana type shows, they&#039;re really compelling, especially to little girls. And we noted her sass factor went thru the roof when she started watching this tripe. WTF? Again - I&#039;m still flabbergasted. So, we did a test and (LIED) and told her the Disney wasn&#039;t available on DirecTV for a bit. Well smack my ass an call me Sally, but removing the Disney &quot;parents are idiots&quot; tripe from her entertainment menu worked. Worked freaking amazingly well. So, we thought maybe we&#039;re mistaking correlation with causation, so I told my wife I&#039;d enable Disney and not tell her when. Ok, not double blind but for home &quot;science&quot; better than just bending over to Walt and his minoins....<br>In 4 or 5 days after re-enabling Disney channel my wife took me aside and said &quot;fucking hell honey, PLEASE tell me you turned Disney back on!&quot;. Yes - I had turned Disney back on.. She was actually relieved.<br>So to this date forward, Disney is 100% blocked out on our DirecTV boxes. Mind you folks I&#039;m not a prude, oh fucking hell no. Our kids go to South Beach every year with Mom and Pop, we&#039;re actually quite liberal with life, freedom, and entertainment content. But this Disney shit???

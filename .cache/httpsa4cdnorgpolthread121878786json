They are the ones who engineer the criminal underworld for the most efficient possible &quot;harvests&quot;.<br><br>This is how the racket works: The cops use an army of &quot;informants&quot; who are legally allowed to commit crimes for &quot;surveillance&quot;. These are the top-tier criminals who push most of the drugs and launder most of the money. They make sure kickbacks get sent to the cops and recruit\/train\/employ kids off the street to join the criminal enterprise. As long as the informant is &quot;gathering intelligence&quot; the cops will leave that gang alone, sometimes for years at a time while they destroy the neighborhood. This causes the normies to demand more funding for the cops, as well as securing the greatest amount of black market kickbacks. <br><br>As soon as the informants start to lose influence in the gang (the underlings will get cocky and uppity after a while), or the gang is around too long and the normies start wondering why the cops never arrest them, the cops harvest the gang. They raid everyone, take all the drugs and money (which they get to spend), throw the gangsters into slave-labor prisons, look like heroes, and make room for the next group of criminals-in-training. Their informant narc (almost always the gang leader) get a comfy retirement in witness protection on the taxpayers dime. <br><br>This is why we need militia law-enforcement and need to move away from the prison system and back to traditional punishments.","time":1492630435,"resto":121878786,"id":"43VdBNjd","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121884275,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)15:34:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121882849\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121882849<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121883466\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121883466<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121883495\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121883495<\/a><br>Fuck off, degenerates.","time":1492630472,"resto":121878786,"id":"GxcfZxpY","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121884385,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)15:35:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121878786\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121878786<\/a><br>I dont trust anyone further than I can throw them, and I&#039;m not very strong<br><br>I always show respect when I have to deal with the police and of my encounter I have 1 ticket and 5 warnings","time":1492630527,"resto":121878786,"id":"dlUAmjNi","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121884400,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)15:35:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121878786\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121878786<\/a><br>Police is risking their lives to niggers so you can live safe, show some respect to them so they feel good about their job","time":1492630538,"resto":121878786,"id":"DsHUTua\/","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":121884432,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)15:35:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"Never had a bad encounter with the police and as such I don&#039;t hate them simply for having a badge.

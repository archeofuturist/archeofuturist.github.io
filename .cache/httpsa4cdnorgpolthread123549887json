This extends out to corporations, which should not be allowed to dictate what individuals do on any level other than inside the workplace. Despite this individualism, there&#039;s something to be said for countries that have more collectivist tendencies, such as Japan. Japan has very low adult crime rates, but this comes at the cost of high juvenile crime rates because society is so stifling to those who don&#039;t fit within its confines well. A system which encourages a healthy amount of collectivism while not infringing on any one individual&#039;s own interests is as good as it gets.","time":1493599731,"resto":123549887,"id":"dxYaz1Jn","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123553566,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)20:50:30","name":"GTFO","com":"SCHOOLIEPROJECT FAG GET THE FUCK OFF MY BOARD REEEEEEE","time":1493599830,"resto":123549887,"id":"s2DgYBC0","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123554754,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)21:00:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123550632\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123550632<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Do you love your country?<\/span><br>94% of Japanese answered Yes","time":1493600431,"resto":123549887,"id":"3KBv+nj2","country":"JP","country_name":"Japan"},{"no":123554944,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)21:02:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123550777\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123550777<\/a><br>Kek knows.

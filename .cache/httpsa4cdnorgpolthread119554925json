This was his burgeoning interest in actually running for office because they weren&#039;t doing what he saw as reasonable and common sense. He started going around talking about the ills of society most notably in a his Oprah interview outside of the ads he already did:<br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=SEP<wbr>s17_AkTI<br><br>This led to his joining the reform party after Perot ran in 1992 and 1996, foiling Bush Senior and republicans from getting the white house for their lack of focus on conservative small government principles, especially in the area of economics.<br><br>He was informed by Perot that it was impossible with the current system to win as a third party candidate so sought the republican nomination.<br><br>After meeting with head republican strategists, he learned that the process was locked for Bush II. He then wanted to use the reform party as his foray into politics on the ballot in a 2000 run but the reform party fell apart before the election.<br><br>After the 2000 election there was no point for him to consider a run again until 2008, as he could not run as a Republican. Yet again the process locked him out in favor of establishment candidate McCain but he also did not wish to run in 2008 due to the unpopularity of the Republican party of the time.","filename":"1491288196831","ext":".jpg","w":590,"h":756,"tn_w":97,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491360625720,"time":1491360625,"md5":"5AHJ4e\/Kqv9DXhj1l9f\/8w==","fsize":51777,"resto":119554925,"id":"FFdkF5Dq","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119556374,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)22:50:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119555550\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119555550<\/a><br>Incidentally and Accidentally. notthing illegal to worry about. your privacy is safe ;)","time":1491360625,"resto":119554925,"id":"lXv5Jk4U","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119556397,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)22:50:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"I GOT THE NASTY IN MY TAXI","filename":"1483208231526","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":640,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491360639001,"time":1491360639,"md5":"3+4F4ISclfCOdDsjTJYv+Q==","fsize":13695,"resto":119554925,"id":"n08nQhbq","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119556415,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)22:50:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119556252\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119556252<\/a><br>Even the nog on bottom left had enough of this shit","time":1491360647,"resto":119554925,"id":"sPlBY+vk","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119556429,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)22:50:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119556373\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119556373<\/a><br>He was able to get votes at a lower cost in primaries than any republican candidate in history.<br><br>His combination of very smart hires like Manafort (who won the primaries for every republican he served) and a lean crew using social media to largely propel the message was drastically more cost effective than any other campaign.<br><br>Just like his mentor Perot in the past, Trump was able to self-fund his campaign, largely, due to his enormous wealth, and did not have to serve interests or do events that he did not deem to gain him the votes he needed.<br><br>He went on to win the presidency at the lowest relative campaign cost in modern American political history.

and right about this Russia nonsense. I&#039;ve pointed it out, but I don&#039;t get the sense it sinks in.<br><br>The common perception is that the left is jabbering a phoney Russian connection because (it is reported) that &#039;the Russians&#039; hacked the DNC, leaked unflattering emails and that changed the election, and thats being generous. And so the left is using coincidences to get even with both Trump and Russia. The narrative has taken numerous sub-plots anytime they can find a Russian remotely associated with someone associated with Trump. More recently, it has been suggested that Obama directed the spying on Trump.<br><br>I really do not believe this is the whole story. Rather than re-state my case, I&#039;d rather use some dialectics to see if \/pol\/ can connect the same dots I have.<br><br>1. Who (globally) stands to lose the most if relations between Russia and the US were normalized?<br>2. Where in the world is the biggest stronghold for leftist, globalist aims characteristic of tearing down Western, white nations, where ultra-liberalism and anti-white\/Christian have become the norm?<br>3. Who has demonstrated the most antagonism and suffered the most humilation from Russia in recent power\/land grabs and failed subversion?<br>4. Would it not follow that such an ultra-leftist, globalist entity would seek to influence and collude with the leftist party of the US?<br>5. If you were trying to terrify Trump politically from even thinking of being publically seen building diplomacy and alliance with Russia for fear of an endless media shitstorm, how would you do it?<br>6. If you needed to outsource intelligence-gathering on Trump and his intentions towards Russia because Trump is not in your region, and you need the government where he resides to do it, who would you solicit to do it?<br><br>I hope this broadens your perception of the scale of our adversaries beyond just American leftists.","filename":"dau (5)","ext":".jpg","w":496,"h":362,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":91,"tim":1491361380678,"time":1491361380,"md5":"kDcm+uk0qSqv6InftceMeQ==","fsize":30563,"resto":119554925,"id":"9rFsHD1l","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119557883,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)23:03:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119557623\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119557623<\/a><br>And they&#039;ll defend it.","time":1491361404,"resto":119554925,"id":"RyJhySz5","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119557885,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)23:03:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"what are these morons talking about","filename":"RUSSIA RUSSIA RUSSIA","ext":".jpg","w":885,"h":496,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1491361405851,"time":1491361405,"md5":"FsF8Mck0TEL2mAoyxiVjoQ==","fsize":273163,"resto":119554925,"id":"xYaYHJUH","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119557886,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)23:03:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119556905\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119556905<\/a><br>At least you can hear them.

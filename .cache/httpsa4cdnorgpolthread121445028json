Trump wasn&#039;t elected to be a good leader, he was elected because he wasn&#039;t hillary. He wasn&#039;t attached to a movement that has spent the last 20-30 years telling white people that they are inherently racist and privileged or telling men that they are no longer relevant and whenever they have an opinion to share in regards to the future of the country, they are automatically wrong because they are men. <br><br>The last presidential election was about the excluded majority trying to burn that shithole to the ground in protest, and it&#039;s worked amazingly well thus far.

Consider the hypothetical case of a man who can have anything he wants just by wishing for it. Such a man has power, but he will develop serious psychological problems. At first he will have a lot of fun, but by and by he will become acutely bored and demoralized. Eventually he may become clinically depressed. History shows that leisured aristocracies tend to become decadent. This is not true of fighting aristocracies that have to struggle to maintain their power. But leisured, secure aristocracies that have no need to exert themselves usually become bored, hedonistic and demoralized, even though they have power. This shows that power is not enough. One must have goals toward which to exercise one\u2019s power.<br><br>35. Everyone has goals; if nothing else, to obtain the physical necessities of life: food, water and whatever clothing and shelter are made necessary by the climate. But the leisured aristocrat obtains these things without effort. Hence his boredom and demoralization.<br><br>36. Nonattainment of important goals results in death if the goals are physical necessities, and in frustration if nonattainment of the goals is compatible with survival. Consistent failure to attain goals throughout life results in defeatism, low self-esteem or depression.<br><br>37, Thus, in order to avoid serious psychological problems, a human being needs goals whose attainment requires effort, and he must have a reasonable rate of success in attaining his goals.","filename":"ted-kaczynski","ext":".jpg","w":272,"h":218,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":100,"tim":1493424302792,"time":1493424302,"md5":"ynpbg6o3vNejihXYGxumzg==","fsize":18719,"resto":123265651,"id":"XdQqFNXC","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123267478,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)20:05:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123265651\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123265651<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;$80,000<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;wealthy<\/span><br>top kek<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;t. shitposter worth $700k<\/span>","filename":"111111111111","ext":".png","w":471,"h":563,"tn_w":104,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493424305245,"time":1493424305,"md5":"LjBM07A5PmEv1nomfjtKew==","fsize":508418,"resto":123265651,"id":"s7omRQp3","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":123267579,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)20:06:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123265651\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123265651<\/a><br>$80k in Los Angeles?

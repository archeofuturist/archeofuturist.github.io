Our perspective and purpose as the human race shifts depending on where we are in history. God, as eternal and outside of time, is fixed in His truth and purpose. Why the difference then? Simple, Christ. The entire purpose of the old testament, and the jewish people as well, is to prepare the way for Christ, and to sustain the culture He needs to be brought into to. This is the single most important issue for the human race, no dispute. That God appears merciless in His persuit of this end is evidence not of His own cruelty, but rather of Christ, and His merciful sacrifice&#039;s importance. The jews and their law needed to be preserved to allow for this. Their preserverence, in fact, is necessary for the Incarnation, Crucifixion, and subsequent endowment of Divine Mercy.<br><br>The second is the fact that God in the New Testament is merciful of course, but not devoid of Justice or wrath.

It&#039;s originally a Jewish sect. Later adopted and perverted European traditions and beliefs and incorporated them so the Europeans could adopt to the new religion easier. At first Christianity was a very strong factor in European society because of the warrior mentality of the people and the everlasting wars against the Turks and the wars that Europeans fought against each other. Christianity destroyed the spiritual essence and original European beliefs and replacing them with a code of laws which originated from a semitic tribe which developed and evolved differently and under different circumstances then the free Europeans. The Bible and it&#039;s 10 commandments as well as the whole concept hasn&#039;t made Europeans spiritually stronger or richer or more enlightened. It actually made us spiritually impotent, and unable to follow our basic instincts and not living to our full potential. <br>Jewish influence in Christianity has never been greater then it is today. All the Churches in the USA for example are zionist. The protestant churches of Europe, especially in Germany, England and Scandinavia are more like zionist\/Soros payed NGO&#039;s then religious institutions. The Vatican itself with the Pope is a nest of Jewish agenda, especially since the 1960&#039;s. The orthodox church had always strong ties to the old testament-jewish traditions.<br>Christianity is basically a religious, jewish based ideology, just as communism is jewish political ideology. Both communism and christianity have strong characteristics of judaism itself. Internationalism, a borderless world, no regard for religious, cultural, ethnic, racial or other borders. Bolshevism was anti christian not because it was a religion that stood in the way of communists, but rather because the orthodox christianity in Russia was a state controled institution and very Russian-based.","time":1492636395,"resto":121880559,"id":"bsw9Ywno","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":121898366,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)17:21:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121897031\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121897031<\/a><br><br>sure. keep thinking that you can earn in any way or contribute to your way to heaven. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Isaiah 45:9 What sorrow awaits those who argue with their Creator.

I say to my workbro &quot;some things never really change tough&quot; he just responds with, &quot;let&#039;s just wait and listen&quot;. His rant starts out pretty similar, but as it goes one it takes quite a different direction, eventually it goes into far right territory and beyond to literally Hitler-tier talking points, nobody argues against it or even reacts, his whole rant ends with him screaming, in front of +30 or so people and in earshot of the boss, ...AND THAT&#039;S WHY WE NEED A NEW HITLER and what was even more disturbing was what happened then, normally nobody would react to his rants or some would argue against him for a bit, but now you could hear &quot;YES&quot; or &quot;THAT&#039;S RIGHT&quot; from the audience.

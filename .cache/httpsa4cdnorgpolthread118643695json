The reality is that the Middle East is a fucked up region filled with degenerate scum who come in all shapes and sizes, and countries like Saudi Arabia and Israel are no fucking exception. They murder, rape, behead, and destroy anything that could be seen as civilization because that&#039;s what the Middle East is good at. Beyond that, if you REALLY wanna get into the Syrian Refugee Crisis, I can tell you from looking just at the photographs, let alone first hand experience with those fuckers, that the majority of those so-called &quot;refugees&quot; are just pussy ass Syrian men who don&#039;t wanna fight for their country. They&#039;re weak and stupid. The mainstream media, both left and right, portrays the refugee crisis as being made up of primarily women and children, but the truth is that is bullshit! They&#039;re mostly young men between the ages of 18 and 30; AKA the age that&#039;s perfect for fighting for your god damn country! Look at the photos you see over in Europe in the tent cities they have set up for these cucks. No one would need to take in refugees if they would simply FIGHT FOR THEIR OWN GOD DAMN LAND!","filename":"al assad undefeated","ext":".jpg","w":480,"h":359,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1490706897168,"time":1490706897,"md5":"UCDfjMotCq43PQi+Yc0dQA==","fsize":15968,"resto":118643695,"id":"2yvNQzwn","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118647356,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)09:15:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118646131\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118646131<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;military aged male &quot;&quot;&quot;refugee&quot;&quot;&quot;<\/span><br>Ftfy","time":1490706941,"resto":118643695,"id":"mg1sbJ+A","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118647415,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)09:16:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118643695\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118643695<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;we<\/span><br>We literally dindu nuffin","time":1490706989,"resto":118643695,"id":"YshVBXbF","country":"CH","country_name":"Switzerland"},{"no":118647451,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)09:16:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118643695\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118643695<\/a><br>Similar to<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Maybe if you stopped criticizing Islam we wouldn&#039;t have so many Allahu Akbars<\/span><br>?","filename":"allahuakbar","ext":".jpg","w":599,"h":422,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":88,"tim":1490707014537,"time":1490707014,"md5":"Fin6D2gGvExWzSX0HwqSjg==","fsize":40238,"resto":118643695,"id":"vMaS82pN","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":118647471,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)09:17:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118643695\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118643695<\/a><br>Gov bombs 3rd world countries, invites 3rd world refugees that they created into the west, naturally that doesn&#039;t end well, gov can then increase the police state.","time":1490707024,"resto":118643695,"id":"ZR0OlT+i","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118647511,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)09:17:36","name":"ANonymous?","com":"<a href=\"#p118643695\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118643695<\/a><br>You deserve the mess you are in because you allowed the jews to fool you into bombnig the middle-east. <br>The jews did the 7\/7 london bombings, the jews did 9\/11. <br>But then the jews point to the muslims and announce to you dumb goy, &quot;The muslims did it, go get them!

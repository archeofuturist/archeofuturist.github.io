Most current lines in the sand were drawn haphazardly by the British and French, and do not observe tribal lines. Tribal loyalties supersede national loyalties in the Middle East. They view themselves first in terms of their tribe, and then their secular group (like Sunni for example), and lastly, as a nation.

First, American business interests abroad are threatened by a popular or democratically elected leader. The people support their leader because he intends to conduct land reform, strengthen unions, redistribute wealth, nationalize foreign-owned industry, and regulate business to protect workers, consumers and the environment. So, on behalf of American business, and often with their help, the CIA mobilizes the opposition. First it identifies right-wing groups within the country (usually the military), and offers them a deal: &quot;We&#039;ll put you in power if you maintain a favorable business climate for us.&quot; The Agency then hires, trains and works with them to overthrow the existing government (usually a democracy). It uses every trick in the book: propaganda, stuffed ballot boxes, purchased elections, extortion, blackmail, sexual intrigue, false stories about opponents in the local media, infiltration and disruption of opposing political parties, kidnapping, beating, torture, intimidation, economic sabotage, death squads and even assassination. These efforts culminate in a military coup, which installs a right-wing dictator. The CIA trains the dictator\u2019s security apparatus to crack down on the traditional enemies of big business, using interrogation, torture and murder. The victims are said to be &quot;communists,&quot; but almost always they are just peasants, liberals, moderates, labor union leaders, political opponents and advocates of free speech and democracy.

But most coups do not involve a real communist threat. &quot;Communism&quot; is anything that goes against business interests, regardless of what the actual political and social structures are. Unlucky nations are targeted for a wide variety of reasons: not only threats to American business interests abroad, but also liberal or even moderate social reforms, political instability, the unwillingness of a leader to carry out Washington\u2019s dictates, and declarations of neutrality in the Cold War. Indeed, nothing has infuriated CIA Directors quite like a nation\u2019s desire to stay out of the Cold War.<br><br>The ironic thing about all this intervention is that it frequently fails to achieve American objectives. Often the newly installed dictator grows comfortable with the security apparatus the CIA has built for him. He becomes an expert at running a police state. And because the dictator knows he cannot be overthrown, he becomes independent and defiant of Washington&#039;s will. The CIA then finds it cannot overthrow him, because the police and military are under the dictator&#039;s control, afraid to cooperate with American spies for fear of torture and execution. The only two options for the U.S at this point are impotence or war. Examples of this &quot;boomerang effect&quot; include the Shah of Iran, General Noriega and Saddam Hussein. The boomerang effect also explains why the CIA has proven highly successful at overthrowing democracies, but a wretched failure at overthrowing dictatorships.","time":1491549487,"resto":119903252,"id":"aB\/3rM1f","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119905921,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)03:18:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119905497\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119905497<\/a><br>c.f Ukraine","time":1491549510,"resto":119903252,"id":"LhqAoM5I","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":119906217,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)03:20:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119905879\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119905879<\/a><br>This pattern played out in many countries:<br><br>Greece: 1947 - President Truman requests military aid to Greece to support right-wing forces fighting communist rebels.

The chaos left by the Ottoman Empire&#039;s collapse was just as bad as anything the British or French could have done. And in truth, I honestly believe that the intention was to help restore a sense of order by creating nation states. The colonial mindset was one of paternal benevolence. The powers of Europe wanted to gain, of course, in a capitalist sense of the word, but they also wanted to build. There was a sense that by bring law and order to the heathens, and by placing them within a Nation State, they could mature into something resembling a society. The mindset said that tribalism was the result of chaos, and that order would bring about hegemony. And practically, it was impossible to deal economically with hundreds of tribes, so that order was needed in the 20th century.","time":1491549788,"resto":119903252,"id":"ZsA440vI","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119906490,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)03:23:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"We help out Dictators so long as their interests align with our own more often than not.

Whereas right-wing forces previously used torture only as a last resort, Mitrione convinces them to use it as a routine, widespread practice. The torture techniques he teaches to the death squads rival the Nazis\u2019. He eventually becomes so feared that revolutionaries will kidnap and murder him a year later.<br><br>Cambodia: 1970 - The CIA overthrows Prince Sahounek, who is highly popular among Cambodians for keeping them out of the Vietnam War. He is replaced by CIA puppet Lon Nol, who immediately throws Cambodian troops into battle. This unpopular move strengthens once minor opposition parties like the Khmer Rouge, which achieves power in 1975 and massacres millions of its own people.<br><br>Bolivia: 1971 - After half a decade of CIA-inspired political turmoil, a CIA-backed military coup overthrows the leftist President Juan Torres.

Contrary to Kissinger\u2019s assertions, Angola is a country of little strategic importance and not seriously threatened by communism. The CIA backs the brutal leader of UNITAS, Jonas Savimbi. This polarizes Angolan politics and drives his opponents into the arms of Cuba and the Soviet Union for survival. Congress will cut off funds in 1976, but the CIA runs the war off the books until 1984, when funding is legalized again. This entirely pointless war kills over 300,000 Angolans.<br><br>1979:<br>Iran \u2014 The CIA fails to predict the fall of the Shah of Iran, a longtime CIA puppet, and the rise of Muslim fundamentalists who are furious at the CIA\u2019s backing of SAVAK, the Shah\u2019s bloodthirsty secret police. In revenge, the Muslims take 52 Americans hostage in the U.S. embassy in Tehran.<br><br>Afghanistan \u2014 The Soviets invade Afghanistan. The CIA immediately begins supplying arms to any faction willing to fight the occupying Soviets. Such indiscriminate arming means that when the Soviets leave Afghanistan, civil war will erupt. Also, fanatical Muslim extremists now possess state-of-the-art weaponry. One of these is Sheik Abdel Rahman, who will become involved in the World Trade Center bombing in New York.<br><br>El Salvador \u2014 An idealistic group of young military officers, repulsed by the massacre of the poor, overthrows the right-wing government.

Carter refuses. Shortly afterwards, right-wing leader Roberto D\u2019Aubuisson has Romero shot through the heart while saying Mass. The country soon dissolves into civil war, with the peasants in the hills fighting against the military government. The CIA and U.S. Armed Forces supply the government with overwhelming military and intelligence superiority. CIA-trained death squads roam the countryside, committing atrocities like that of El Mazote in 1982, where they massacre between 700 and 1000 men, women and children. By 1992, some 63,000 Salvadorans will be killed.<br><br>Iran\/Contra Begins: 1981 - The CIA begins selling arms to Iran at high prices, using the profits to arm the Contras fighting the Sandinista government in Nicaragua. President Reagan vows that the Sandinistas will be &quot;pressured&quot; until &quot;they say \u2018uncle.\u2019&quot; The CIA\u2019s Freedom Fighter\u2019s Manual disbursed to the Contras includes instruction on economic sabotage, propaganda, extortion, bribery, blackmail, interrogation, torture, murder and political assassination.<br><br>Honduras: 1983 - The CIA gives Honduran military officers the Human Resource Exploitation Training Manual \u2013 1983, which teaches how to torture people.

By the late 80s, Noriega\u2019s growing independence and intransigence have angered Washington\u2026 so out he goes.<br><br>Haiti: 1990 - Competing against 10 comparatively wealthy candidates, leftist priest Jean-Bertrand Aristide captures 68 percent of the vote. After only eight months in power, however, the CIA-backed military deposes him. More military dictators brutalize the country, as thousands of Haitian refugees escape the turmoil in barely seaworthy boats. As popular opinion calls for Aristide\u2019s return, the CIA begins a disinformation campaign painting the courageous priest as mentally unstable.<br><br>The Gulf War: 1991 - The U.S. liberates Kuwait from Iraq. But Iraq\u2019s dictator, Saddam Hussein, is another creature of the CIA. With U.S. encouragement, Hussein invaded Iran in 1980. During this costly eight-year war, the CIA built up Hussein\u2019s forces with sophisticated arms, intelligence, training and financial backing. This cemented Hussein\u2019s power at home, allowing him to crush the many internal rebellions that erupted from time to time, sometimes with poison gas. It also gave him all the military might he needed to conduct further adventurism \u2014 in Kuwait, for example.<br><br>Haiti: 1993 - The chaos in Haiti grows so bad that President Clinton has no choice but to remove the Haitian military dictator, Raoul Cedras, on threat of U.S. invasion. The U.S. occupiers do not arrest Haiti\u2019s military leaders for crimes against humanity, but instead ensure their safety and rich retirements.

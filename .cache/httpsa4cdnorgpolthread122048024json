Last one was a major selling point for Trump. <br><br>They are both populists, just different kinds of populists.<br><br>Just like Trump, Bernie would have had major problems in getting his policy trough congress and senate. As result if Bernie would be president he would have to deal with a lot of voter disillusion as he wouldn&#039;t be able to push his shit trough political system. Kinda like Trump as we speak.","time":1492728532,"resto":122048024,"id":"KbdYjwQV","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":122057800,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)18:49:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122057561\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122057561<\/a><br><br>Too bland and too old.","time":1492728583,"resto":122048024,"id":"KbdYjwQV","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":122057852,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)18:50:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122048024\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122048024<\/a><br>Man, remember when Hillary&#039;s corruption was so strong she turned off Dem voters so much they wouldn&#039;t even vote for her against the fucking Donald?<br><br>She is truly a peerless cunt","time":1492728606,"resto":122048024,"id":"HHqKE4u1","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122059088,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)18:59:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"I&#039;m 100% confident Bernie would&#039;ve won. I hate the guy, I hate his policies, I hate his redditor supporters, but I was rooting for Hillary to win the primaries because I knew for certain that Trump could beat Hillary but not Bernie. Bernie is just too mild-mannered and dirt-free. At worst, he&#039;s a idealistic bum. The reasons not to vote for him were too complicated and wordy to turn people away from him. Trump won because Hillary is a rotten, oligarchal, dynastic, establishment globalist witch, and Trump&#039;s bluster still barely beat her. 77,744 combined voters in the flipped rust belt states handed Trump the election. If he didn&#039;t take them, he would&#039;ve lost. It would&#039;ve been incredibly easy for Bernie to take them with a campaign trail smarter than Hillary&#039;s. She pushed them right into Trump&#039;s arms by completely ignoring them their very troubling time.","time":1492729191,"resto":122048024,"id":"KEbPcyX2","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

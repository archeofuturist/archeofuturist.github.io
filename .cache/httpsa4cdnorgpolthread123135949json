The CIA is the whip of (((American))) imperialism, this is how the Bush cabal gripped power for four decades, possibly longer.

They run the Washington Post for chrissakes, read &#039;Family of Secrets&#039; by Russ Baker. <br><br>American imperialism means the CIA + Mossad run the world, with Rothschild-backed British Intel. Look at Warner Bros, or Paramount, the CIA has agents all over Hollywood. And they&#039;re selling to China. We get ZERO from imperialism. We get more 4chan forums. Nationalists and anti-kikes could speak out in the 50s.

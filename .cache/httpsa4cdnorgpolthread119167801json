This is a fact that many can attest to. Not the pursuit of money, sex, travel or freedom can give you the same level of existential satisfaction as raising a house of kids.<br><br>Don&#039;t listen to people who say that marriage is a trap and doomed to always fail. They exaggerate statistics and spread falsehoods. Don&#039;&#039;t listen to people who say it is not financially feasable. As long as you don&#039;t live in a city, raising a family on a single income is possible. Don&#039;t listen to people who try to convince you that it is better to sleep around, save up money, and achieve complete &quot;independance&quot;. They are leading you down a path of loneliness and unfullfillment.<br><br>I see it important to make threads like these because so many young men and women these days are exposed to the media, which is just so aggressively anti-marriage and anti-family. Tv shows and movies rarely depict happy families. It&#039;s all about single people leading the &quot;good life&quot;, or depictions of broken families and failing marriages. Tabloids and online news articles run nothing but stories about failing celebrity marriages and sensational stories about divorce, cheating and alimony. Online pornography paints monogamy as boring and casual sex as exciting.<br><br>Don&#039;t let it get to you. Even though finding a partner might be a bit more difficult these days, don&#039;t give up. You don&#039;t have to join the rest of the young people your age in the pursuit of hedonism. Be different from them. Reject it and find peace in family life.","filename":"3573562452","ext":".jpg","w":848,"h":516,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":152,"tim":1491042900064,"time":1491042900,"md5":"3MkiBOSKWeaL72UQ8ICbcA==","fsize":238646,"resto":0,"id":"0y8TTg37","country":"AU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"get-married","country_name":"Australia","replies":18,"images":2,"unique_ips":13},{"no":119168074,"now":"04\/01\/17(Sat)06:39:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"Yeah man, I know.

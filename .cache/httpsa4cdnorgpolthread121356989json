The United States also informed the world that Alan Shepard would make a space journey in the spacecraft Freedom 7 on 5 May, 1961.<br><br>The Soviet Union was forced to do something to save face. For this reason a Soviet cosmonaut, Vladimir Ilyushin, was sent up into space on 7 April, 1961. The Americans intercepted several radio communications between him and the space centre in the Soviet Union. Ilyushin&#039;s landing failed and he was seriously injured. He could not be shown to the public. It was claimed that he had been injured in a car accident. He was sent to China to receive better medical treatment.<br><br>The Soviet Union did not have a spare capsule at that time and in Moscow it was decided to orchestrate a huge bluff, a cosmic lie.<br><br>Radio Moscow claimed that a Soviet cosmonaut, Yuri Gagarin, had been sent up into space on the morning of 12 April, 1961 with the space-rocket Mostok. According to the official announcement, he had already landed and was in fine health. The whole world believed this except for the Western intelligence services. They had not managed to register any radio communication between Gagarin and the space centre.<br><br>This hoax was sloppily orchestrated. Polish newspapers announced already on the morning of 12 April that a Soviet cosmonaut had been in space. Newspapers in other countries did not report Gagarin&#039;s flight until 13 April.","filename":"GagarinRussia[1]","ext":".jpg","w":473,"h":461,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":243,"tim":1492348472855,"time":1492348472,"md5":"WsqH4Fu4B7MP+s1IB8p5Dw==","fsize":51053,"resto":0,"id":"QDgS4ilO","country":"RU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"until-1961-the-united-states-had-managed-to-send","country_name":"Russian Federation","replies":10,"images":3,"unique_ips":8},{"no":121357170,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)09:16:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"So why didn&#039;t the US call them out on the hoax?","time":1492348594,"resto":121356989,"id":"cEwOTJge","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121357379,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)09:19:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"nice try nasa shill","time":1492348741,"resto":121356989,"id":"eMnPBmtz","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121357392,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)09:19:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121357170\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121357170<\/a><br>No proof","time":1492348750,"resto":121356989,"id":"56Pg2Q\/H","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":121357528,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)09:20:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121357170\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121357170<\/a><br>Just the same reason US didn&#039;t respond to Georgia attack.<br>D E M O C R A T <br>E<br>M<br>O<br>C<br>R<br>A<br>T","filename":"FlightReturn[1]","ext":".jpg","w":673,"h":423,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":78,"tim":1492348846890,"time":1492348846,"md5":"C5avhCP+b1qfF0DzKqDTvw==","fsize":72142,"resto":121356989,"id":"QDgS4ilO","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":121358427,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)09:31:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"Gonna need some proofs there mate","filename":"1b7","ext":".png","w":599,"h":491,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":102,"tim":1492349486897,"time":1492349486,"md5":"W4JAb7Z1QyU4GcR5Ba5gCA==","fsize":117938,"resto":121356989,"id":"qTJlS97b","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121358899,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)09:37:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121356989\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121356989<\/a><br>Soviets also started the moon landing hoax","time":1492349836,"resto":121356989,"id":"nP0YnX\/b","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121359097,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)09:39:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121356989\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121356989<\/a><br>Looks like Kremlin&#039;s ban against foreign agents isn&#039;t working so well.","time":1492349977,"resto":121356989,"id":"z2mFartE","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":121360308,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)09:52:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121359097\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121359097<\/a><br>Kremlin itself doesn&#039;t work so well.<br><br>The reason is obviouse: just a bunch of corrupt crooks.","filename":"vedmid","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":596,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":124,"tim":1492350771337,"time":1492350771,"md5":"sc\/q4+j4EurGIt4eqy5bng==","fsize":70740,"resto":121356989,"id":"QDgS4ilO","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":121360437,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)09:54:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121356989\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121356989<\/a><br>The Russians actually killed two people before they got Yuri into orbit.","time":1492350852,"resto":121356989,"id":"iq20AJNy","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":121363038,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)10:24:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121360437\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121360437<\/a><br>And numerous dogs","time":1492352641,"resto":121356989,"id":"QDgS4ilO","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"}]}

The remaining 66% should be splitted into 1000 packages of coins and each package should be sold at a spot price of 5900usd. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;With the Wyoming example this would be as follows:<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Price: US$5,900,000<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Parcel Size:10710,41 Hectares<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Square meters: 107,104,100<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Initial coins: 107,104,100<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Reserved for investors (to be released later): 35,344,353<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Reserved for initial settlers: 71,759,747<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Every settler pays 5900 for 71,759 coins<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Now there are rules (yet to be created) to be a settler. So even if you have coins, it is not a guarantee that you are going to be able to actualy settle. But let&#039;s assume you have the coins and you are eligible to apply to be a settler. Then you move to the ranch, and you can claim a piece of land giving to the company-town hall the amount of coins that matches with the square meters you have claimed. These coins are then destroyed by sending them to a bogus coin address so actually records the transaction. Coins are never extracted from this address and for this matter, there is no private key (This can be done). <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;So, if investors cannot use coins to actually settle (because they are not elegible to apply) what can they do with these coins? Well they can build plants or shopping malls, or stuff that will help our economy while giving them profit.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Also, with because this is a crypto currency we can take leverage from bitcoin exchanges, asking them to add our cryptocurrency. Because our crypto will be the first that it&#039;s attached to a land, i believe we can get MILLIONS in weeks.<\/span>","filename":"1490035905352","ext":".jpg","w":641,"h":530,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":103,"tim":1490143841676,"time":1490143841,"md5":"RZh9\/4LOgj11cX0pFP+ZGQ==","fsize":42834,"resto":117693162,"id":"U1h5mKp0","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":117696654,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)20:56:04","name":"pakistanis are faggots","com":"<a href=\"#p117694973\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117694973<\/a> Yeah sounds nice for a Harold Covington movie, not for the movement that believes in the stars. <br><br>Europe tier?

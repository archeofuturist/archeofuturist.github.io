Here is an illustration of the way in which the oversocialized leftist shows his real attachment to the conventional attitudes of our society while pretending to be in rebellion aginst it. Many leftists push for affirmative action, for moving black people into high-prestige jobs, for improved education in black schools and more money for such schools; the way of life of the black \u201cunderclass\u201d they regard as a social disgrace. They want to integrate the black man into the system, make him a business executive, a lawyer, a scientist just like upper-middle-class White people. The leftists will reply that the last thing they want is to make the black man into a copy of the white man; instead, they want to preserve African American culture. But in what does this preservation of African American cultura consist? It can hardly consist in anything more than eating black-style food, listening to black-style music, wearing black-style clothing and going to a black-style church or mosque. In other words, it can express itself only in superficial matters. In all ESSENTIAL respects most leftists of the oversocialized type want to make the black man conform to white, middle-class ideals. They want to make him study technical subjects, become an executive or a scientist, spend his life climbing the status ladder to prove that black people are as good as white. They want to make black fathers \u201cresponsible,\u201d they want black gangs to become nonviolent, etc. But these are exactly the values of the industrial- technological system. The system couldn\u2019t care less what kind of music a man listens to, what kind of clothes he wears or what religion he believes in as long as he studies in school, holds a respectable job, climbs the status ladder, is a \u201cresponsible\u201d parent, is nonviolent and so forth. In effect, however much he may deny it, the oversocialized leftist wants to integrate the black man into the system and make him adopt its values.","filename":"1486501570339","ext":".gif","w":225,"h":534,"tn_w":105,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490923424988,"time":1490923424,"md5":"trpsg+7ePVQttLr0lLd2zg==","fsize":52416,"resto":0,"id":"2g\/ooO\/Z","country":"ES","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"thread-i-httpsboards4chanorgpolthread118995036","country_name":"Spain","replies":12,"images":12,"unique_ips":1},{"no":118999450,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)21:25:04","name":"Don&#039;t mind me, just dumping","com":"<a href=\"#p118999289\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118999289<\/a><br><br>30. We certainly do not claim that leftists, even of the oversocialized type, NEVER rebel against the fundamental values of our society. Clearly they sometimes do. Some oversocialized leftists have gone so far as to rebel against one of modern society\u2019s most important principles by engaging in physical violence. By their own account, violence is for them a form of \u201cliberation.\u201d In other words, by committing violence they break through the psychological restraints that have been trained into them. Because they are oversocialized these restraints have been more confining for them than for others; hence their need to break free of them. But they usually justify their rebellion in terms of mainstream values. If they engage in violence they claim to be fighting against racism or the like.<br><br>31. We realize that many objections could be raised to the foregoing thumbnail sketch of leftist psychology. The real situation is complex, and anything like a complete description of it would take several volumes even if the necessary data were available. We claim only to have indicated very roughly the two most important tendencies in the psychology of modern leftism.<br><br>32. The problems of the leftist are indicative of the problems of our society as a whole. Low self-esteem, depressive tendencies and defeatism are not restricted to the left. Though they are especially noticeable in the left, they are widespread in our society. And today\u2019s society tries to socialize us to a greater extent than any previous society. We are even told by experts how to eat, how to exercise, how to make love, how to raise our kids and so forth.","filename":"1486501633165","ext":".gif","w":225,"h":534,"tn_w":52,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490923504896,"time":1490923504,"md5":"JMLUfoCsqKA\/+F6TpPBMMw==","fsize":73705,"resto":118999289,"id":"2g\/ooO\/Z","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":118999741,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)21:27:36","name":"Don&#039;t mind me, just dumping","com":"<a href=\"#p118999450\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118999450<\/a><br><br>THE POWER PROCESS<br><br>33. Human beings have a need (probably based in biology) for something that we will call the power process. This is closely related to the need for power (which is widely recognized) but is not quite the same thing. The power process has four elements. The three most clearcut of these we call goal, effort and attainment of goal. (Everyone needs to have goals whose attainment requires effort, and needs to succeed in attaining at least some of his goals.) The fourth element is more difficult to define and may not be necessary for everyone. We call it autonomy and will discuss it later (paragraphs 42-44).<br><br>34. Consider the hypothetical case of a man who can have anything he wants just by wishing for it. Such a man has power, but he will develop serious psychological problems. At first he will have a lot of fun, but by and by he will become acutely bored and demoralized. Eventually he may become clinically depressed. History shows that leisured aristocracies tend to become decadent. This is not true of fighting aristocracies that have to struggle to maintain their power. But leisured, secure aristocracies that have no need to exert themselves usually become bored, hedonistic and demoralized, even though they have power. This shows that power is not enough. One must have goals toward which to exercise one\u2019s power.","filename":"1486501696330","ext":".gif","w":225,"h":540,"tn_w":52,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490923656208,"time":1490923656,"md5":"UgUDhAcybtl1XyqGE4JKOQ==","fsize":125671,"resto":118999289,"id":"2g\/ooO\/Z","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":118999800,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)21:28:13","name":"Don&#039;t mind me, just dumping","com":"<a href=\"#p118999741\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118999741<\/a><br><br>35. Everyone has goals; if nothing else, to obtain the physical necessities of life: food, water and whatever clothing and shelter are made necessary by the climate. But the leisured aristocrat obtains these things without effort. Hence his boredom and demoralization.<br><br>36. Nonattainment of important goals results in death if the goals are physical necessities, and in frustration if non-attainment of the goals is compatible with survival. Consistent failure to attain goals throughout life results in defeatism, low self-esteem or depression.<br><br>37. Thus, in order to avoid serious psychological problems, a human being needs goals whose attainment requires effort, and he must have a reasonable rate of success in attaining his goals.","filename":"1486501758575","ext":".gif","w":222,"h":533,"tn_w":52,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490923693971,"time":1490923693,"md5":"cP4KA4yTqSWqVUlys9vy6w==","fsize":29115,"resto":118999289,"id":"2g\/ooO\/Z","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":119000101,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)21:30:41","name":"Don&#039;t mind me, just dumping","com":"<a href=\"#p118999800\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118999800<\/a><br><br>38. But not every leisured aristocrat becomes bored and demoralized. For example, the emperor Hirohito, instead of sinking into decadent hedonism, devoted himself to marine biology, a field in which he became distinguished. When people do not have to exert themselves to satisfy their physical needs they often set up artificial goals for themselves. In many cases they then pursue these goals with the same energy and emotional involvement that they otherwise would have put into the search for physical necessities. Thus the aristocrats of the Roman Empire had their literary pretensions; many European aristocrats a few centuries ago invested tremendous time and energy in hunting, though they certainly didn\u2019t need the meat; other aristocracies have competed for status through elaborate displays of wealth; and a few aristocrats, like Hirohito, have turned to science.","filename":"1486501820869","ext":".gif","w":225,"h":534,"tn_w":52,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490923841960,"time":1490923841,"md5":"bYGLIoqb9zgz3fhFMYDmvA==","fsize":54633,"resto":118999289,"id":"2g\/ooO\/Z","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":119000207,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)21:31:29","name":"Don&#039;t mind me, just dumping","com":"<a href=\"#p119000101\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119000101<\/a><br><br>39. We use the term \u201csurrogate activity\u201d to designate an activity that is directed toward an artificial goal that people set up for themselves merely in order to have some goal to work toward, or let us say, merely for the qake of the \u201cfulfillment\u201d that they get from pursuing the goal. Here is a rule of thumb for the identification of surrogate activities. Given a person who devotes much time and energy to the pursuit of goal X, ask yourself this: If he had to devote most of his time and energy to satisfying his biological needs, and if that effort required him to use his physical and mental faculties in a varied and interesting way, would he feel seriously deprived because he did not attain goal X? If the answer is no, then the person\u2019s pursuit of goal X is a surrogate activity. Hirohito\u2019s studies in marine biology clearly constituted a surrogate activity, since it is pretty certain that if Hirohito had had to spend his time working at interesting non-scientific tasks in order to obtain the necessities of life, he would not have felt deprived because he didn\u2019t know all about the anatomy and life-cycles of marine animals. On the other hand the pursuit of sex and love (for example) is not a surrogate activity, because most people, even if their existence were otherwise satisfactory, would feel deprived if they passed their lives without ever having a relationship with a member of the opposite sex. (But pursuit of an excessive amount of sex, more than one really needs, can be a surrogate activity.)","filename":"1486501984550","ext":".gif","w":224,"h":533,"tn_w":52,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490923889689,"time":1490923889,"md5":"wZjgbAIl2eFmy+DJAz0vTA==","fsize":174708,"resto":118999289,"id":"2g\/ooO\/Z","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":119000477,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)21:33:45","name":"Don&#039;t mind me, just dumping","com":"<a href=\"#p119000207\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119000207<\/a><br><br>40. In modern industrial society only minimal effort is necessary to satisfy one\u2019s physical needs. It is enough to go through a training program to acquire some petty technical skill, then come to work on time and exert the very modest effort needed to hold a job. The only requirements are a moderate amount of intelligence and, most of all, simple OBEDIENCE. If one has those, society takes care of one from cradle to grave. (Yes, there is an underclass that cannot take the physical necessities for granted, but we are speaking here of mainstream society.) Thus it is not surprising that modern society is full of surrogate activities. These include scientific work, athletic achievement, humanitarian work, artistic and literary creation, climbing the corporate ladder, acquisition of money and material goods far beyond the point at which they cease to give any additional physical satisfaction, and social activism when it addresses issues that are not important for the activist personally, as in the case of white activists who work for the rights of nonwhite minorities. These are not always PURE surrogate activities, since for many people they may be motivated in part by needs other than the need to have some goal to pursue. Scientific work may be motivated in part by a drive for prestige, artistic creation by a need to express feelings, militant social activism by hostility. But for most people who pursue them, these activities are in large part surrogate activities. For example, the majority of scientists will probably agree that the \u201cfulfillment\u201d they get from their work is more important than the money and prestige they earn.","filename":"1486600237864","ext":".gif","w":222,"h":533,"tn_w":52,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490924025876,"time":1490924025,"md5":"f9P1vOxSG0vpxz7wMhtkIg==","fsize":134256,"resto":118999289,"id":"2g\/ooO\/Z","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":119000736,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)21:35:53","name":"Don&#039;t mind me, just dumping","com":"<a href=\"#p119000477\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119000477<\/a><br><br>41. For many if not most people, surrogate activities are less satisfying than the pursuit of real goals (that is, goals that people would want to attain even if their need for the power process were already fulfilled). One indication of this is the fact that, in many or most cases, people who are deeply involved in surrogate activities are never satisfied, never at rest. Thus the money-maker constantly strives for more and more wealth. The scientist no sooner solves one problem than he moves on to the next. The long-distance runner drives himself to run always farther and faster. Many people who pursue surrogate activities will say that they get far more fulfillment from these activities than they do from the \u201cmundane\u201d business of satisfying their biological needs, but that is because in our society the effort needed to satisfy the biological needs has been reduced to triviality. More importantly, in our society people do not satisfy their biological needs AUTONOMOUSLY but by functioning as parts of an immense social machine. In contrast, people generally have a great deal of autonomy in pursuing their surrogate activities.","filename":"1421129018073","ext":".png","w":755,"h":801,"tn_w":117,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490924153048,"time":1490924153,"md5":"vIJ9qT5LYacuYZWJCqGqAA==","fsize":72161,"resto":118999289,"id":"2g\/ooO\/Z","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":119000967,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)21:37:42","name":"Don&#039;t mind me, just dumping","com":"<a href=\"#p119000736\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119000736<\/a><br><br>AUTONOMY<br>42. Autonomy as a part of the power process may not be necessary for every individual. But most people need a greater or lesser degree of autonomy in working toward their goals. Their efforts must be undertaken on their own initiative and must be under their own direction and control. Yet most people do not have to exert this initiative, direction and control as single individuals. It is usually enough to act as a member of a SMALL group. Thus if half a dozen people discuss a goal among themselves and make a successful joint effort to attain that goal, their need for the power process will be served. But if they work under rigid orders handed down from above that leave them no room for autonomous decision and initiative, then their need for the power process will not be served. The same is true when decisions are made on a collective basis if the group making the collective decisi\u00f3n is so large that the role of each individual is insignificant. [5]<br><br>43. It is true that some individuals seem to have Little need for autonomy. Either their drive for power is weak or they satisfy it by identifying themselves with some powerful organization to which they belong. And then there are unthinking, animal types who seem to be satisfied with a purely physical sense of power (the good combat soldier, who gets his sense of power by developing fighting skills that he is quite content to use in blind obedience to his superiors).","filename":"1428330556580","ext":".png","w":600,"h":600,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490924262178,"time":1490924262,"md5":"5wCaxg49AVk2OW8U84pdIA==","fsize":80947,"resto":118999289,"id":"2g\/ooO\/Z","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":119001082,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)21:38:52","name":"Don&#039;t mind me, just dumping","com":"<a href=\"#p119000967\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119000967<\/a><br><br>44.

When one does not have adequate opportunity to go through the power process the consequences are (depending on the individual and on the way the power process is disrupted) boredom, demoralization, low self-esteem, inferiority feelings, defeatism, depression, anxiety, guilt, frustration, hostility, spouse or child abuse, insatiable hedonism, abnormal sexual behavior, sleep disorders, eating disorders. etc. [6]","filename":"1428883753017","ext":".jpg","w":800,"h":820,"tn_w":121,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490924332106,"time":1490924332,"md5":"hHBXo2ohpMSX5I3mVZIivg==","fsize":181679,"resto":118999289,"id":"2g\/ooO\/Z","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":119001392,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)21:41:42","name":"Don&#039;t mind me, just dumping","com":"<a href=\"#p119001082\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119001082<\/a><br><br>SOURCES OF SOCIAL PROBLEMS<br><br>45. Any of the foregoing symptoms can occur in any society, but in modern industrial society they are present on a massive scale. We aren\u2019t the first to mention that the world today seems to be going crazy. This sort of thing is not normal for human societies. There is good reason to believe that primitive man suffered from less stress and frustration and was better satisfied with his way of life than modern man is. It is true that not all was sweetness and light in primitive societies. Abuse of women was common among the Australian aborigines, transexuality was fairly common among some of the American Indian tribes. But it does appear that GENERALLY SPEAKING the kinds of problems that we have listed in the preceding paragraph were far less common among primitive peoples than they are in modern society.<br><br>46. We attribute the social and psychological problems of modern society to the fact that that society requires people to live under conditions radically different from those under which the human race evolved and to behave in ways that conflict with the patterns of behavior that the human race developed while living under the earlier conditions. It is clear from what we have already written that we consider lack of opportunity to properly experience the power process as the most important of the abnormal conditions to which modern society subjects people. But it is not the only one. Before dealing with disruption of the power process as a source of social problems we will discuss some of the other sources.<br><br>47. Among the abnormal conditions present in modern industrial society are excessive density of population, isolation of man from nature, excessive rapidity of social change and the breakdown of natural small-scale communities such as the extended family, the village or the tribe.","filename":"1429021872182","ext":".png","w":624,"h":434,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":86,"tim":1490924502662,"time":1490924502,"md5":"U5TlqQSElrbJl225CYNoPQ==","fsize":104975,"resto":118999289,"id":"2g\/ooO\/Z","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":119001652,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)21:44:10","name":"Don&#039;t mind me, just dumping","com":"<a href=\"#p119001392\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119001392<\/a><br><br>48. It is well known that crowding increases stress and aggression. The degree of crowding that exists today and the isolation ofman fromnature are consequences of technological progress. All pre-industrial societies were predominantly rural. The Industrial Revolution vastly increased the size of cities and the proportion of the population that lives in them, and modern agricultural technology has made it possible for the Earth to support a far denser population than it ever did before. (Also, technology exacerbates the effects of crowding because it puts increased disruptive powers in people\u2019s hands. For example, a variety of noise-making devices: power mowers, radios, motorcycles, etc. If the use of these devices is unrestricted, people who want peace and quiet are frustrated by the noise. If their use is restricted, people who use the devices are frustrated by the regulations. But if these machines had never been invented there would have been no conflict and no frustration generated by them.)<br><br>49. For primitive societies the natural world (which usually changes only slowly) provided a stable framework and therefore a sense of security. In the modern world it is human society that dominates nature rather than the other way around, and modern society changes very rapidly owing to technological change. Thus there is no stable framework.<br><br>50. The conservatives are fools: They whine about the decay of traditional values, yet they enthusiastically support technological progress and economic growth. Apparently it never occurs to them that you can\u2019t make rapid, drastic changes in the technology and the economy of a society without causing rapid changes in all other aspects of the society as well, and that such rapid changes inevitably break down traditional values.","filename":"1429112221792","ext":".jpg","w":338,"h":273,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":100,"tim":1490924650992,"time":1490924650,"md5":"4QMBlSVh8l3bavGpR9W3SQ==","fsize":22687,"resto":118999289,"id":"2g\/ooO\/Z","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":119001761,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)21:45:08","name":"Don&#039;t mind me, just dumping","com":"<a href=\"#p119001652\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119001652<\/a><br><br>51. The breakdown of traditional values to some extent implies the breakdown of the bonds that hold together traditional small-scale social groups. The disintegration of small-scale social groups is also promoted by the fact that modern conditions often require or tempt individuals to move to new locations, separating themselves from their communities. Beyond that, a technological society HAS TO weaken family ties and local communities if it is to function efficiently. In modern society an individual\u2019s loyalty must be first to the system and only secondarily to a smallscale community, because if the internal loyalties of small-scale communities were stronger than loyalty to the system, such communities would pursue their own advantage at the expense of the system.<br><br>52. Suppose that a public official or a corporation executive appoints his cousin, his friend or his co-religionist to a position rather than appointing the person best qualified for the job. He has permitted personal loyalty to supersede his loyalty to the system, and that is \u201cnepotism\u201d or \u201cdiscrimination,\u201d both of which are terrible sins in modern society. Would-be industrial societies that have done a poor job of subordinating personal or local loyalties to loyalty to the system are usually very inefficient. (Look at Latin America.) Thus an advanced industrial society can tolerate only those small-scale communities that are emasculated, tamed and made into tools of the system. [7]<br><br>53. Crowding, rapid change and the breakdown of communities have been widely recognized as sources of social problems. But we do not believe tbey are enough to account for the extent of the problems that are seen today.","filename":"1430438926248","ext":".png","w":624,"h":434,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":86,"tim":1490924708687,"time":1490924708,"md5":"OFDAdG1nlHV\/QgRg3XVAEQ==","fsize":83637,"resto":118999289,"id":"2g\/ooO\/Z","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"}]}

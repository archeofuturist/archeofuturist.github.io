We know that Jesus existed, and, assuming the existence of God, that he quite possibly was the Son of God. <br><br>Whether you want to argue that everything in the Bible is fact is a different matter, as like all human stories, it&#039;s subject to embellishment and mistranslation. There are books of the bible that aren&#039;t actually in the bible, per Church authorities. You&#039;d need to ask a biblical scholar to know more, but the bible certainly isn&#039;t fiction. At worst, it&#039;s full of embellished and excluded stories.<br><br>As for Christianity being used for control, that&#039;s nothing unique. All knowledge is power and power is inevitably used for control; the smart taking advantage of the stupid. <br><br>Politicization of religion isn&#039;t something that&#039;s confined to religion.

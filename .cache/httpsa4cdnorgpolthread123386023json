Well, going by Google street view Argentina seems beautiful. Proper Buenos Aires is absolutely breathtaking, the outskirt are ok and even comfy with those kind of grass. Cordoba and Mendoza are cool too. Rosario which yesterday some one said was an absolute shithole seems ok, the worst part being fisherton which is way better than the outskirt of the balkans and there were smiling workers.

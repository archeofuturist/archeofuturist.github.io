I brought up statistics and everything, where he just brought up an ancedotal example of a guy he met outside of his college and how when he got benefits he got himself out of it. Why the fuck are some people more dispossitioned to ancedotal evidence more than others, and, why specifically those that identify with the left?","filename":"maxresdefault","ext":".jpg","w":1701,"h":1129,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":165,"tim":1491771966854,"time":1491771966,"md5":"xEN6iXgvK0QCON2xyGme\/g==","fsize":269140,"resto":0,"id":"7q7pIC9J","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"alright-pol-i-got-into-a-long-drawn-out-debate","country_name":"United States","replies":12,"images":1,"unique_ips":6},{"no":120337117,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)17:08:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"Individualism. as long as it works for the anecdotal 1% of the people it&#039;s a good system, that&#039;s why leftists are NWO shills.","time":1491772082,"resto":120336826,"id":"RNOcdi6o","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120337393,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)17:09:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120336826\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120336826<\/a><br>Honestly just tell him to read books.

The natural way to rely heavily on emotion (even if they don&#039;t know it) and anecdotal evidence and storytelling. <br><br>The political left actually exploits this to great degree, and I&#039;m convinced they do it on purpose. The left&#039;s main ideas all have to do with things that make people feel good and don&#039;t require tough decisions. It always has to do with &quot;compassion&quot; and letting government &quot;solve problems&quot;. Forget about the problems with too much compassion, forget about all those nasty details that go into the government &quot;solving&quot; things, let alone the unintended consequences. Just feel good about yourself and vote for progressive policies! You&#039;re saving the world!<br><br>The funniest part is that they also somehow brainwash everyone into thinking that they are more logical, more cerebral, more scientific, more evidence-based. Reality has a leftwing bias, duh!<br><br>Being conservative and traditional is accepting harsh truths, such as the fact that some problems are fucking hard to ever solve and might always be with us. Another one is that trying to do good sometimes makes things worse. The effects are what matter, not your intentions. Yet another truth is that some things that have worked for thousands of years shouldn&#039;t be fucked with just because we think we are so clever that we can change it for the better where our ancestors failed.","time":1491774573,"resto":120336826,"id":"\/aONv\/GB","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120343905,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)17:56:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120342965\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120342965<\/a><br><br>Another thing that really irks the fuck out of me is how idealistic every single leftist I&#039;ve ever met has been.

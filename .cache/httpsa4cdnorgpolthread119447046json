Arranged, sure. But arranged marriage doesn&#039;t equate to a forced marriage, it just means the families are married rather than two individuals. We should rebuild the old custom of arranged marriages where the parents consult their children on finding a mate and the families invest in each other rather than individuals investing in each other. We can build stronger communities this way. Pre-marital sex should also be a no-no. Purity should be an ideal so the youth remains uncorrupted and those who are old know they are investing in a future that is worth living for. This wouldn&#039;t create a perfect society, at least I don&#039;t think so. But it would vastly improve society by making marriage sacred for not only individuals but an entire family. Unity and integrity is paramount for a strong and healthy society, monogamous arranged heterosexual marriage with a Germanic understanding of marriage and purity is the formula for a functional society which could in theory overcome any obstacle.","time":1491294752,"resto":119447046,"id":"GP\/AddZu","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119448887,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)04:32:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119447046\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119447046<\/a><br><br>realistically 21-25 would be an ideal age for the woman being a well balanced person who is emotionally developed yet still isn&#039;t too old for 5-6 children at the least.<br><br>I agree that the earlier the better, but sadly today&#039;s society has been pushing the age of maturity further and further into the 20s and 30s, to the point where there was that poll that concluded that most millenials don&#039;t feel like they&#039;re adults until they&#039;re 30.<br><br>A woman at 16-21 is simply way too immature nowadays for a healthy relationship.","time":1491294766,"resto":119447046,"id":"ZHoFuo6s","country":"IL","country_name":"Israel"},{"no":119448927,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)04:33:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119447046\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119447046<\/a><br>17","time":1491294808,"resto":119447046,"id":"Dbnj0vnZ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119448956,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)04:33:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119447046\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119447046<\/a><br>Whenever she feels ready to marry.","time":1491294837,"resto":119447046,"id":"hSXqgHas","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119448984,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)04:34:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119448448\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119448448<\/a><br><a href=\"#p119448356\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119448356<\/a><br><a href=\"#p119448306\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119448306<\/a><br>Found you guys a new necklace!","filename":"IMG_5031","ext":".jpg","w":800,"h":430,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":67,"tim":1491294875302,"time":1491294875,"md5":"Wv+vFTYMvKOrSGIThLkXxw==","fsize":61095,"resto":119447046,"id":"GP\/AddZu","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119449002,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)04:34:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119448306\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119448306<\/a><br>Yep you should be with her as a young girl and mould her to be your perfect wife.","time":1491294889,"resto":119447046,"id":"3aHQYhHd","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":119449004,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)04:34:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119447046\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119447046<\/a><br>Most women are ready to be mothers when they are 18.

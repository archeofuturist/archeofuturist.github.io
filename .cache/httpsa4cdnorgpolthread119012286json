But at this point that is all he has done so we will have to wait and see. Unfortunately the establishment, republicans and democrats are bent on making Trump a failure to serve as an example that people should trust the main stream media. And also to prevent him from making term limits. Imagen how much more credability the news will get back if Trump&#039;s presidency fails. Then the population can be more easily controlled again.","filename":"I want you for the alt-right","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":637,"tn_w":98,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490931727371,"time":1490931727,"md5":"b\/oRt1iV+JTgN0Oe84uVeA==","fsize":91196,"resto":119012286,"id":"TzctM4Zm","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119016888,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)00:00:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119012286\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119012286<\/a><br>is her hair band made of anal beads?","time":1490932850,"resto":119012286,"id":"ZGdr54uR","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

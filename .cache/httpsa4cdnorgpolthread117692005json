They flew on his jet to join him at his private estate on the Caribbean island of Little Saint James. They even joked about his taste in younger women.<br><br>President Trump called Epstein a \u201cterrific guy\u201d back in 2002, saying that \u201che\u2019s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side.\u201d<br><br>Now, Trump is on the witness list in a Florida court battle over how federal prosecutors handled allegations that Epstein, 64, sexually abused more than 40 minor girls, most of them between the ages of 13 and 17. The lawsuit questions why Trump\u2019s nominee for labor secretary, former Miami U.S. attorney Alexander Acosta, whose confirmation hearing is scheduled to begin Wednesday, cut a non-prosecution deal with Epstein a decade ago rather than pursuing a federal indictment that Acosta\u2019s staff had advocated.","filename":"lolli","ext":".jpg","w":528,"h":700,"tn_w":188,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490141633045,"time":1490141633,"md5":"JJUA8zSWRRNO97\/BtrijOQ==","fsize":102594,"resto":0,"id":"mRPaC+ot","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"trumps-labor-nominee-cut-sweetheart-deal-as","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

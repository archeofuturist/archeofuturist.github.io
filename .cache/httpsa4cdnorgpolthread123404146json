Georgism corrects this flaw by not only recognizing common resources like land, minerals, water, fish stocks as such, but adds that by managing these resources with user fees, you can get rid of all other taxation and remove impediments to economic development. So under Georgism, regular folk are mostly taxed in proportion to the value of any land they may possess. The vast majority of people would pay a lot less than they currently pay in income, payroll and consumption taxes, but absentee landlords would pay a lot more, and the mortgage business of banks would be an order of magnitude smaller, because land taxes cancel the benefits of homeownership as an investment. The system also discourages the inefficient use of land, controlling sprawl and inefficient farming practices. Housing and transportation costs would be greatly reduced, thus allowing for a greater equality of opportunity. A Universal basic income (UBI) could provide for those unable to work.","filename":"Poll tax, LVT, Income tax","ext":".png","w":409,"h":331,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":101,"tim":1493513339293,"time":1493513339,"md5":"vMTrYQ0YxJLGNAWpOt3grg==","fsize":36979,"resto":123404146,"id":"\/2lNNyNs","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123411415,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)20:51:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123404146\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123404146<\/a><br>Never heard of Henry George before but I just looked him up and he seems to echo many of my own thoughts.","time":1493513493,"resto":123404146,"id":"v7Hu6Ajf","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123411441,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)20:51:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123404146\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123404146<\/a><br><br>Compare the parts of Capitalism and Georgism.

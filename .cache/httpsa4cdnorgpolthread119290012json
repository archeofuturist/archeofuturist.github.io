I&#039;m pretty right-wing, race-realist, voted for Trump etc, but I&#039;m getting tired of always being called uneducated, un-scientific and a shallow thinker. The left always talks about how they are on the side of reason and science and logic - it&#039;s obviously not true, but it&#039;s amazing how convincing and superior they sound when they say it. They release all these reports about how uneducated, dumb and manipulated we always are. I&#039;m just so tired of feeling dumb all the time.","filename":"443","ext":".jpg","w":480,"h":360,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1491193494129,"time":1491193494,"md5":"cijkvA+kv10+3a1DXtFMYw==","fsize":15088,"resto":0,"id":"652Ke6CY","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"is-demoralization-a-leftist-specialty-because-i","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":1,"unique_ips":2},{"no":119290188,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)00:26:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"yeah they are so superior and smart that the democrat party is the weakest it has been since 1920 and is on the verge of dying because they cater to delusional sjw faggots and illegals","filename":"7H67H6c","ext":".jpg","w":552,"h":479,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":108,"tim":1491193609649,"time":1491193609,"md5":"lhOnyMjIYD8XVfixarzZrQ==","fsize":30581,"resto":119290012,"id":"A6sCVnfF","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

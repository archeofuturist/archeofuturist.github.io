You must be successful, reliable, hardworking, and, above all, happy. Do people in your life trust and respect you? What does your family think of you? Racial politics doesn\u2019t have to be the only factor of that. If you can\u2019t achieve these things in your real life, then you are not ready to be a political activist, either anonymously or in reality.<br><br>Always remember: we live in first world countries and have opportunity that most people born on this planet don\u2019t. So work your ass off, every day, to build a good life for yourself. Because if you can\u2019t make anything of your own, individual life, then how can you think you\u2019ll be able to make a difference for the race, for the lives of many? Spend your time wisely, and keep your real life priorities in order. Nothing on the internet should ever take away from your real life. Your time on Earth is short and precious. Start planning on making the most of it.","filename":"1488454732736","ext":".png","w":617,"h":315,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":127,"tim":1491477562359,"time":1491477562,"md5":"Wo3WsS6veLy\/rolCUiasqA==","fsize":391064,"resto":0,"id":"qj+mhir0","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-most-important-thing-you-can-do-for-the-white","country_name":"United States","replies":5,"images":1,"unique_ips":5},{"no":119732586,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)07:21:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119732389\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119732389<\/a><br>once that top comes off, those titties go full pancake","time":1491477718,"resto":119732389,"id":"RxeuQyh0","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119733324,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)07:31:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;tfw 26 and wanting to settle down with a nice qt white wife<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;all women my age just want to get drunk and have one night stands<\/span>","time":1491478313,"resto":119732389,"id":"hhjglw3V","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119733739,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)07:37:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119732586\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119732586<\/a><br>Who?","time":1491478660,"resto":119732389,"id":"j0rkkd+a","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119734084,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)07:42:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119733324\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119733324<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;buying into this narrative<\/span><br><br>Typically it is women who struggle to find someone who&#039;s willing to settle down and have kids.

To me this is a clear proof of God. We were created as free creatures able to chose our own destiny, but the knowledge of good and evil is inside us. We know that to be kind and loving should be strived for without needing to learn this. This is what Christ showed us through his life and deeds.","filename":"12312536","ext":".png","w":1563,"h":2400,"tn_w":162,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492361963189,"time":1492361963,"md5":"wa7KT\/kL\/vG9gGd0Pbf+MA==","fsize":41312,"resto":0,"id":"C1H70qnl","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"human-beings-know-whats-good-or-evil-across-all","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":3,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":121383624,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)13:15:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121381290\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121381290<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;human beings know what&#039;s good or evil across all cultures<\/span><br>This is wildly inaccurate. Many cultures have sacrificed humans. Many others have traditions or customs that are amoral in another, like genital mutilation or arranged marriages for the purpose of personal profit. It&#039;s a really inconvenient fact for the simple-minded, but morality is always relative. Some things &quot;feel&quot; instinctual, but remember always that anecdotal evidence is rarely anything but arbitrary input that only complicates the actual results. This thread is not even remotely critically thought-out.","time":1492362946,"resto":121381290,"id":"v3ZGxmRM","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121384072,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)13:19:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121383624\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121383624<\/a><br>These people are well aware that they are committing an evil. <br><br>Human sacrifice is a great horror, and even the cultures which practiced it were well aware of it.

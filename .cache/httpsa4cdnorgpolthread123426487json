The sick? The unfortunate? The crippled?<br><br>We have massive leeway in terms of what we can afford to let live without it really affecting our lifestyle.

You can&#039;t afford another one so you just die of exposure, wasting a perfectly good doctor? And don&#039;t say insurance, because insurance is the core concept of socialism.

The only reason the public sector gets such a bad rep is because the private sector launches media campaigns against it, often via bribed politicians, so they soften up public opinion before they privatize shit for profit.

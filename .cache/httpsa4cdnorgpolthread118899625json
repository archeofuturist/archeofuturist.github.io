More often than not, the people going to (or graduated from) &quot;amis&quot; are associated with lower IQ, alcoholism, and dirty hands. They are the people who work their butt off in dirty jobs to be able to buy their &quot;friday bottle&quot; (&quot;perjantai-pullo&quot; - those finnish guys will certainly know what that means). Friday-bottle is a 0.5-liter bottle of some type of grain spirit (vodka, or &#039;koskenkorva&#039;). These are in 35-40% range, and one such bottle is roughly equivalent to 9 regular beers (or 7 IPAs). After this amount is consumed by each, a group of &quot;amis&quot; students might go to a bar to continue (likely starting a brawl) or gather to a parking lot, a market place etc. to 1) talk about cars, 2) beat up someone (especially someone from a different town\/country), or 3) look for 14-18yo girls who are too young to get into bars, but are still drunk and looking for attention. These events may be repeated the next night (Saturday). Sunday is for recovering from a bad hangover. And, after another week of working\/stydying, a new friday comes with a new bottle, and the whole show starts again.

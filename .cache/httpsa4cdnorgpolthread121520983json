BLOC PARTY &amp; COOKOUT <br>The &quot;Alt-Right&quot; is coming back to Berkeley... But we will gladly escort them back out! Let&#039;s come together to enjoy music, food, speakers, and each other&#039;s company while we drown out the embarrassing attempts of racists and nationalists to display their hate-fueled support for Trump. <br><br>Let&#039;s fill MLK park with our resilient bodies before these bigots can even show their faces, prevent their rally, and send the message that we aren&#039;t down with the hate \u2014 all while enjoying dope beats and delicious BBQ. <br><br>WHAT TO BRING:<br>YOUR CREW - Do not come alone! It is crucial to bring your friends so that you can have each other&#039;s backs if something were to go down. Even though our goal is to shut down the pro-Trump rally before it can even happen, there is a pattern of fascists and Trump supporters coming armed to rallies and attacking anti-racists, especially targetting Black, Trans and Gender Non-Conforming people.* <br><br>A MASK - Masking up or otherwise concealing your identity helps protect you from the alt-right and the state. There is a risk of the alt-right doxxing individuals for the purposes of online harassment campaigns which can lead to off-line consequences. You also want to assure the state does not identify you so they cannot target you for repression later on. Consider bringing an extra mask in case someone else might need one! <br><br>*In the last year, emboldened by Trump&#039;s hate campaign, we have seen an intense rise in white supremacist activity and targetted attacks. From burning Black churches to vandalizing Mosques, there is no limit to how low these bigots will stoop. And we have seen the horrors they commit when confronted in the streets. From the shooting of a GDC member in Seattle at a Milo Yiannopoulos protest to the 7 people (almost all of whom were Black or Trans) stabbed by neo-nazis on June 26th, 2016 at the state&#039;s capital \u2014 Trump supporters and the far-right aren&#039;t hesitant to commit heinous acts of violence..","time":1492433387,"resto":121520983,"id":"4mxUspis","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"}]}

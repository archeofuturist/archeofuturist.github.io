We don&#039;t want to get involved in Syria, and not only that, but it is almost certain that Assad had nothing to do with this strike. We have had 5 gas attacks in the past in Syria, with 4 of them being proven to be done by the rebels or other terrorist organizations and one where it is uncertain who launched it, even though globalist liberals and neocons would claim that this one instance was Assad. Further more, why would Assad even do this in the first place? If you hold no biased opinions and only look at this from an objective stand point, you will see that this is the most idiotic strategy to ever employ. It would turn all the citizens of Syeria against him, the threat of war from outside forces if he does this is way to high, and he was winning the war against the rebels. Now either this is globalist propaganda in order to finally get in there and have a regime change in order to make Syria a failed state like so many others before, or Assad is the most idiotic military strategist in history. Take your pick.","filename":"IMG_1138","ext":".jpg","w":750,"h":674,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":224,"tim":1491574078814,"time":1491574078,"md5":"P5VnNs7U9ajgWS25DrD7Iw==","fsize":95314,"resto":0,"id":"eamjUXvc","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"syrian-missiles","country_name":"United States","replies":5,"images":0,"unique_ips":6},{"no":119952958,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)10:08:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119952804\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119952804<\/a><br><br>FUCK TRUMP! I supported Trump through the meme wars and even lost all of my irl friends. He is bowing down to the establishment doing the complete opposite of everything he said. I shouldn&#039;t be shocked but I feel like my God Emperor has turned on me and I can&#039;t control myself. I&#039;m literally shaking just thinking about everything I sacrificed for him just to be let down. I don&#039;t even know what to tell my 3 year old son who still proudly wears his Maga hat.","time":1491574132,"resto":119952804,"id":"kQc6sz8t","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119954184,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)10:15:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119952804\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119952804<\/a><br>I think Trump is compromised and Israel has him by the balls.

And it&#039;s unlikely Assad even did the chemical attacks. But even if he did who fuckng cares. To say depleted uranium is ok but gas isn&#039;t? GTFO with that bullshit. The only reason we&#039;re Involved is Israel, again.

They fucking hate Assad, saw their window closing and committed a false flag. If this is true, Trump played along either unwittingly, knowing it was the Jews but still wanting situation 1, or he&#039;s a Zionist plant.<br><br>What happens next narrows down these options. If we go into Syria and get out Assad and it&#039;s Iraq 2.0 then congrats we all just memed a kike operative into the white house. Or Trump&#039;s just a retard.

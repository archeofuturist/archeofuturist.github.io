Your whole fucking nation is based on lies &quot;we fought for muh freedom against the British&quot; no you fought because rich people got pissed off at a tea tax. &quot;We are the most based conservative nation in the world&#039; no you fucking aren&#039;t the North of the USA is just like Leafland there are no fucking differences in social attitudes. &quot;We are white and everyone else is gonna be brown&quot; lol the majority of American children are already brown you retards you got just as many years as any other western nation before you are brown. The only reason you guys are even slightly patriotic is because from day one you were brainwashed with heroic lies saying America is the best. No you fucking aren&#039;t you have less history then Canada ffs at least we joined wars when they started. From 1800-1941 nothing fucking happened in America you had a civil war and that&#039;s about it. All you did was bicker about who&#039;s better Protestants or Catholics. Ffs you couldn&#039;t even win a war against a couple chinks in the jungle. So much for the superiority of th American soldier.","filename":"image","ext":".jpg","w":519,"h":324,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":156,"tim":1492847468314,"time":1492847468,"md5":"0GRKxn0Esyk5dOoS8o+xQA==","fsize":68716,"resto":0,"id":"1xttJLym","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"im-gonna-take-a-shot-at-america-rip-me","country_name":"Canada","replies":14,"images":5,"unique_ips":6},{"no":122252516,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)03:53:23","name":"Anonymous","filename":"Canada","ext":".png","w":488,"h":490,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492847603900,"time":1492847603,"md5":"aedHXWiUdb1k6TBJ731L4Q==","fsize":640114,"resto":122252385,"id":"E72LM1SI","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122252550,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)03:53:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"Yea","time":1492847639,"resto":122252385,"id":"p1r5+UcJ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122252567,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)03:54:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122252385\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122252385<\/a><br>They weren&#039;t angry about a tea tax, they were angry about not being directly represented in parliament.<br>Still overreacted though.","time":1492847654,"resto":122252385,"id":"rOZxTLqz","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122252605,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)03:55:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122252385\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122252385<\/a><br>tl;dr<br><br>LEAVES WILL BE RAKED!!!!","filename":"url","ext":".jpg","w":274,"h":184,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1492847705810,"time":1492847705,"md5":"oc23S6NBIjQURELsbsjtWA==","fsize":3516,"resto":122252385,"id":"IB14AZAr","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122252693,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)03:56:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122252385\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122252385<\/a><br>Fuck off, leaf.","time":1492847790,"resto":122252385,"id":"lUOM3BBk","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122252754,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)03:57:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122252567\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122252567<\/a><br>You&#039;re partially right.

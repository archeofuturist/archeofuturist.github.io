Ultimately many things can be blamed for Germany&#039;s defeat and unlike WW2 their defeat was far from inevitable.

By 1918 German forces were making up the backbone of Central Powers forces in the Balkans, Italy, and the western front, in addition to occupying eastern Europe, this stretched their forces extremely thin, which combined with the casualties from the failed Spring Offensives which cost them many of their best soldiers left them incredibly vulnerable to the entente offensives in 1918.<br><br>Another major issue was the British naval blockade which essentially starved Germany, this was a major factor in mass discontent that led to the eventual collapse of the second Reich. To counter this Germany attempted to wage submarine warfare against the entente which not only failed to starve them out, but angered many neutral countries including ultimately the United States. Had Theodore Roosevelt hypothetically won in 1912 the US likely would have joined the war by 1915 as submarine warfare led to hundreds of American civilians dying.","time":1490152919,"resto":117706288,"id":"W+luL8DC","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117713058,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)23:23:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"Trenches &amp; gas, like everyone else.","time":1490152990,"resto":117706288,"id":"qIx8m2jq","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117713071,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)23:23:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117710640\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117710640<\/a><br>They were being starved out by the Allied fleets though, which continued 6 months after they had surrendered.

The effects were twofold. One, the Germans couldn&#039;t afford massive prolonged offensives or they risked bleeding out their storm trooper units leaving their military effectively unable to launch offensives until they could replenish their number. Second, the fact that units had to be specially trained meant they couldn&#039;t carry out sudden offensives as easily as the entente. I would argue that the deal blow of WW1 was illustrated at Cambrai, which although of no tactical importance illustrated the British ability to launch an offensive anywhere without the massive preparation that had previously been required. This forced Germany on the defensive for the most part as they couldn&#039;t risk an offensive when the French and British could suddenly launch an offensive anywhere on the line. The fall of Russia alleviated that issue but by then the spring offensives were required since Germany didn&#039;t have the capabilities to wage a prolonged war now that the United States entered the war.","time":1490153406,"resto":117706288,"id":"W+luL8DC","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117713831,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)23:30:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117707624\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117707624<\/a><br><br>Our governments are trillions in debt and overrun with degenerates and shitskins.

Throughout 1914-1916 the German army was terrified of overextending their forces. Even then the primary reason the Russian Empire finally collapsed was because the Tsar refused to reform. Without hindsight going all in against Russia was practically suicide. The reason France was targeted was because they could be theoretically defeated in a short amount of time. Even with poor management by the Tsar by the time of the February revolution the Germans still didn&#039;t hold any lands in Russia proper and only drove them just out of modern Poland and Lithuania. <br><br>While going all out against Russia is probably the best idea, without hindsight it would be impossible to know that.","time":1490153740,"resto":117706288,"id":"W+luL8DC","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117714498,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)23:37:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117706288\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117706288<\/a><br><br>trying to invade russia during the winter might have been the issue","time":1490153834,"resto":117706288,"id":"8i3f2oAH","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":117714573,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)23:37:50","name":"Anonymous","filename":"a05fa13aeaad92864c0853887cd1128de1e212cb_1_600x804","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":804,"tn_w":93,"tn_h":124,"tim":1490153870260,"time":1490153870,"md5":"n9gfp3rZtWWipQmKXSNbuQ==","fsize":258272,"resto":117706288,"id":"Ql5KAcOw","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117714623,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)23:38:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117713831\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117713831<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Our governments are trillions in debt<\/span><br>To whom?","time":1490153889,"resto":117706288,"id":"Pg5pcgyU","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117714643,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)23:38:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"Germans lost because of supplies.

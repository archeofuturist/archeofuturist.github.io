Ultimately many things can be blamed for Germany&#039;s defeat and unlike WW2 their defeat was far from inevitable. However perhaps the biggest issue was that Germany essentially attempted to solo most of the world due to allying with a third rate military power, going to war to defend that third rate power, and dragging more third rate powers into the war. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Austria-Hungary was driven out of Serbia and actually lost ground to tiny Serbia until Bulgaria joined the war and the Spanish flu crippled Serbia<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Bulgaria were the losers of the second Balkan war just a year before WW1 started<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The Ottoman Empire were the losers of the Italo-Turkish and First Balkan Wars just a couple of years ago back to back<\/span><br>What Germany should have done in 1914 is thrown Austria-Hungary under the bus. The end result of their weak allies was greater and greater German requirements to ensure that their allies didn&#039;t completely collapse. By 1918 German forces were making up the backbone of Central Powers forces in the Balkans, Italy, and the western front, in addition to occupying eastern Europe, this stretched their forces extremely thin, which combined with the casualties from the failed Spring Offensives which cost them many of their best soldiers left them incredibly vulnerable to the entente offensives in 1918.<br><br>Another major issue was the British naval blockade which essentially starved Germany, this was a major factor in mass discontent that led to the eventual collapse of the second Reich. To counter this Germany attempted to wage submarine warfare against the entente which not only failed to starve them out, but angered many neutral countries including ultimately the United States. Had Theodore Roosevelt hypothetically won in 1912 the US likely would have joined the war by 1915 as submarine warfare led to hundreds of American civilians dying.","time":1490152919,"resto":117706288,"id":"W+luL8DC","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117713058,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)23:23:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"Trenches &amp; gas, like everyone else.","time":1490152990,"resto":117706288,"id":"qIx8m2jq","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117713071,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)23:23:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117710640\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117710640<\/a><br>They were being starved out by the Allied fleets though, which continued 6 months after they had surrendered.

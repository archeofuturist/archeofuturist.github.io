The benefits of islam are few, in fact all i can think of is having women cover their hair, which i must point out any religious woman already does when she is in the house of the Lord. I just don&#039;t see the benefit of having a mostly muslim black america. Though having a mostly &#039;anything&#039; other than the atheist hedonism the majority currently embrace would be an improvement.

I just want to stress that no religion will tame a western woman in a western world that is now matriarchal in nature. you can start to see these same transformative demographics in white america as well as divorce, single parenthood, and degeneracy takes hold.

Isn&#039;t that what Christian blacks already do and isn&#039;t that exactly what segregation laws were for 1864-1960? In my opinion this was the biggest squandered opportunity given to black america. And now it&#039;s gaining more attention now that blacks rediscovered that buying black, supporting black communities, and living a moral lifestyle is important. <br><br>I think there is a deeper underlying problem here, pic related.

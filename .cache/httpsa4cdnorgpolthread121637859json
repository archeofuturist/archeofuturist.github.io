The benefits of islam are few, in fact all i can think of is having women cover their hair, which i must point out any religious woman already does when she is in the house of the Lord. I just don&#039;t see the benefit of having a mostly muslim black america. Though having a mostly &#039;anything&#039; other than the atheist hedonism the majority currently embrace would be an improvement. They simply were manipulated by the jews in the music industry, hollywood etc.","filename":"5841156498754","ext":".jpg","w":578,"h":600,"tn_w":120,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492493053295,"time":1492493053,"md5":"jA8P+yD4QExbbKia4irfdA==","fsize":79525,"resto":121637859,"id":"NDssSSbF","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121644257,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)01:29:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121643700\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121643700<\/a><br>It was their abrahamic religious affiliation prior to being sold off to the colonial Americans.

I just want to stress that no religion will tame a western woman in a western world that is now matriarchal in nature. you can start to see these same transformative demographics in white america as well as divorce, single parenthood, and degeneracy takes hold. Black america is just 20-30 years ahead of white america.

I believe that if men re-embrace religion and refuse to associate with any woman who is not devoutly religious, they will fall in line.

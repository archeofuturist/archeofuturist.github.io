The benefits of islam are few, in fact all i can think of is having women cover their hair, which i must point out any religious woman already does when she is in the house of the Lord. I just don&#039;t see the benefit of having a mostly muslim black america. Though having a mostly &#039;anything&#039; other than the atheist hedonism the majority currently embrace would be an improvement. They simply were manipulated by the jews in the music industry, hollywood etc.","filename":"5841156498754","ext":".jpg","w":578,"h":600,"tn_w":120,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492493053295,"time":1492493053,"md5":"jA8P+yD4QExbbKia4irfdA==","fsize":79525,"resto":121637859,"id":"NDssSSbF","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121644257,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)01:29:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121643700\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121643700<\/a><br>It was their abrahamic religious affiliation prior to being sold off to the colonial Americans.

This general is for the discussion of Cuckoldry, the ideology of revolutionary open relationships and sexual desire.<br><br>Cuckoldry is the next stage of relationship following the monogamy.<br><br>What exactly is cuckoldry according to cucks:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Cuckoldry is a stage of relationship in which the reproductive means of the wife are bull-owned, and husband gets to bed not in order to have sex with her but to prep the bull.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Cuckoldry in it&#039;s full form is a pleasurably degrading, bull-worshipping relationship that follows the maxim &quot;From each according to their ability, to each according to their need.&quot;<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;To achieve such a relationship cuckoldry teaches us that we must replace the standrad marrige, which is controlled by the husband and a wife, by a cucked relationship, which is controlled by the bull. Then, a period of prepping follows in which the bull is pleasured by the cuck. When the bull class has been prepped, there will be time for wife to get mounted by the bull, and eventually the functions of the husband will become indistinguishable from the functions of a porn shot fluffer, and his genitalia will &#039;wither away&#039; as Marx said.<\/span><br><br>I don&#039;t have any websites but i&#039;m pretty sure OP can help me with that.","filename":"1490568985404","ext":".png","w":1010,"h":1010,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492456039537,"time":1492456039,"md5":"l8vZtt4WUtUw+3\/dqcoJeg==","fsize":212480,"resto":121546226,"id":"45P2vhVQ","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":121565300,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)15:07:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121564454\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121564454<\/a><br>This.<br><br>The real problem is post-modernism, that tries to monopoly the left and socialism with &quot;cultural&quot; marxism, which is opposed to marxism basics to 200%.","time":1492456059,"resto":121546226,"id":"Jq1oTQhp","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":121565340,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)15:07:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"communism = public ownership of the means of production. literally just this and nothing more.<br><br>the level of \/pol\/ delusions about what communism actually is is beyond my understanding<br>this is the result of western propaganda or what?","time":1492456079,"resto":121546226,"id":"uhxDDjdY","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":121565353,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)15:08:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"hElLO c0mRaDeS!!!~~ tHiS g3nErAl iS 4 tHe DiScU55 of MaRxIsM-lEnInIsM, ThE iDeOl0gY oFFFFF ReVoLuTioNaRy SoCiAlIsM aNd CoMuNiSm~~~ (LoVe!!!!)<br><br>C0MMUNI5M~~~ iS THE NEXT BIG THING iN lIkE 4eVa!~~~~<br>WhAt eXcLy i5 CoMuNiSm:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;CoMuNiSm HoPiN h3 wILL n0tIcE u~~~<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;CoMuNiSm iS bEiN iNsEpArAtAbLe FrOm u FRIENDS!!!~~~~~<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;To MaKe CoMuNiSm U nEeD 2 sEiZe MeMes (LOL SO RANDOM XDDDDD) oF pRoDuCtIoN fRoM tOsE FAKE BOURGEIZE SLUTS (i hate them so much! )<\/span><br>https:\/\/www.livejournal.com\/archive<wbr>\/marx\/works\/1847\/11\/prin-com.htm<br>https:\/\/www.livejournal.com\/archive<wbr>\/marx\/works\/1848\/communist-manifest<wbr>o\/","filename":"1490896750207","ext":".gif","w":400,"h":400,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492456085943,"time":1492456085,"md5":"HWBi2i3h+wSahpUt7HVasA==","fsize":314328,"resto":121546226,"id":"45P2vhVQ","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":121565475,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)15:08:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"yo KANGZ an KWEENZ.

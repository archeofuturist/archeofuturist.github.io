If I decline to bake a cake for someone because they are gay, it depends on what state they are in. 22 states have LGBT protections for public accommodations in some form and courts have given conflicting rulings. I think the law would be used to try to discriminate against gay people and adds nothing that isn&#039;t already present. If a church somehow WERE forced to perform a gay marriage then I would expect a court decision to resolve that with no law needed.

Just you&#039;re regular night hockey game on had some food couple beers i was feeling good. Then he starts asking me questions 1st topic he asked me about what happened to Alex Jones, initially i thought he was going to tell me about a news story but it was about his divorce. I don&#039;t care about another mans divorce so i was disappointed that convo went nowhere. Next he asks me about Bill O&#039;Riley I don&#039;t like or follow Bill but I took the position that I didn&#039;t know if he was guilty or not because lack of evidence \/ girls do lie. This angered him he was 110% sure of his guilt and started to raise his voice like he expected me to change my opinion. That&#039;s not how I work. Then he accused me of being alt-right and having there mentality. Started doing the whole you&#039;re an angry basement dweller called me Misogynist and a xenophobe. I was stunned he knew me for years I couldn&#039;t believe that he thought that i was all this stuff. I lived with him 3 or 4 years and that whole time I never went on 4chin I only came back for the election. Now he is projecting all this stuff on me https:\/\/en.wiki pedia.org\/wiki\/Psychological_projec<wbr>tion. If this is true he is in a very dark place. I am concerned this election cycle was too much for them. What can we do to break the ugly psychological effects of having a sure win taken away from them? They are defeated and broken and on edge like I have never seen before.","filename":"obeyFinal","ext":".jpg","w":2230,"h":1743,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":195,"tim":1493639975784,"time":1493639975,"md5":"6HmwDWfNGCT7q6zCkuAhMw==","fsize":101390,"resto":0,"id":"LtI288xd","country":"CA","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"how-can-we-help-our-reddit-friends-feeling-of","country_name":"Canada","replies":5,"images":0,"unique_ips":4},{"no":123612172,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)08:01:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;How can we help our reddit friends feeling of inferiority?<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;a fat steaming mess of tl;dr<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;leaf<\/span><br><br>I&#039;m a fan of kill yourself and die in a fire.","time":1493640060,"resto":123612050,"id":"RHFmFhyW","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123612404,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)08:03:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123612172\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123612172<\/a><br>Canadians lack the body fat of Amerifats We don&#039;t burn with the same intensity.","time":1493640198,"resto":123612050,"id":"LtI288xd","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123613038,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)08:09:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123612050\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123612050<\/a><br>it&#039;s too late for them, they are drones that can only project the mindless rhetoric shoved down their throats from corporate influence and SJW culture that controls their platform.

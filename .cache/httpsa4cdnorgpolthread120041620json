TRUMPS STILL PLAYING CHESS","com":"After the gas attack false flag by the globalists in Syria he knew he would be crucified by the media for not doing anything so he knew he had to do something to make it seem as if he&#039;s protecting the children and standing up to a dictator.<br><br>I believe trump decided to do a slap on the wrist type airstrike with minimal damage and casualties in order to make it so they can no longer claim hes a russian agent and they cant claim he did nothing while children died while at the same time not going into a war.<br><br>He knows they&#039;ll keep doing more false flags to get him to do more military strikes. He played into their hand this one time on purpose.<br><br>Like how they did a gas attack again right after he launched the missles BUT Trump didn&#039;t attack them after the 2nd attack because he never planned on going to war with Syria. It was all for show to destroy the russian agent narrative, furthering the destruction of the media&#039;s crediiblity, and to also send a message to the world that he isn&#039;t afraid to use the military if he has to.<br><br>I think trump is going to now come in and try to make a deal with russia and syria to de-escalate the regions conflicts and say we need to end the slaughter.<br><br>That way, we don&#039;t go to war, the region will be back to how it was, and the media cant say shit about him<br><br>If he continues to attack Syria he&#039;s compromised. If this was the only strike then it&#039;s nothing to worry about.<br><br>They are going to keep doing false flags in Syria and using the mainstream media to pressure him into more military strikes and they will criticize him harshly for not attacking. But this ties into his attacking of the military bases with the planes that were supposedly used. He did that on purpose so if they keep doing false flags he can say well Assad couldn&#039;t have done it this time because we took all his chemical weapons away and destroyed his planes, therefore it must be ISIS.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;cont<\/span>","filename":"mount trumpmore","ext":".jpg","w":360,"h":337,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":234,"tim":1491606133685,"time":1491606133,"md5":"\/ffHjoBc2KNQLhp\/TeH0IA==","fsize":32740,"resto":0,"id":"EtcFhkjU","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"ok-guys-calm-down-i-figured-this-out-trumps-still","country_name":"United States","replies":8,"images":1,"unique_ips":4},{"no":120041698,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)19:02:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"I see this escalating with domestic false flags here at home, blamed on either assad or russia and then the mainstream media pressure will REALLY be on trump to take military action. <br><br>Now, if you look at the recent news of Trump putting nukes in South Korea, this is all part of the plan. Kim is scared shitless now because of what trump did in syria to prove he&#039;s not playing games and this is a direct threat to NK to keep them in check. Trump will not attack NK pre-emptivley but he will have nukes aimed right at them for as long as he&#039;s in office so they won&#039;t even think of trying anything because if they do they&#039;ll be just a note in the history books.<br><br>Also, the recent meeting with the Chinese president ties into this. Trump made some sort of deal with China to prevent China from interfering with Trump moving nukes to South Korea since China is NK ally.<br><br>Now, we will have peace with Syria and Russia and NK will be under control.<br><br>Reserve your judgement for now.

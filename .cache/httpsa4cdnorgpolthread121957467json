I&#039;m bored and wanted to see if \/pol\/ would be willing to test my grasp on these topics. So AMA regarding conspiracy theories, supernatural, or other related topics.

Larry Silverstein, who owned the WTC at the time, also very conveniently made 455,000,000 off of a insurance deal he made prior to the attack. Plus I think there was particular airline (not sure of the name) that had a lot of its stock sold before the attack too by someone unknown.","time":1492666819,"resto":121957467,"id":"NE1vj53O","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121959163,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)01:42:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"What&#039;s the deal with the Bermuda Triangle?","time":1492666936,"resto":121957467,"id":"7mZ9ZlAd","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121959263,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)01:43:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"Did dinosaurs exist?","time":1492666997,"resto":121957467,"id":"z5LQuChs","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

Larry Silverstein, who owned the WTC at the time, also very conveniently made 455,000,000 off of a insurance deal he made prior to the attack. Plus I think there was particular airline (not sure of the name) that had a lot of its stock sold before the attack too by someone unknown.","time":1492666819,"resto":121957467,"id":"NE1vj53O","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121959163,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)01:42:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"What&#039;s the deal with the Bermuda Triangle?","time":1492666936,"resto":121957467,"id":"7mZ9ZlAd","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121959263,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)01:43:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"Did dinosaurs exist?","time":1492666997,"resto":121957467,"id":"z5LQuChs","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121960136,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)01:52:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"You aren&#039;t a real conspiracy theorist until you&#039;ve been redpilled on (((windmills))) and why the government is giving subsidies like candy to put them up everywhere","time":1492667555,"resto":121957467,"id":"1ACK9URF","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121960182,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)01:53:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121959163\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121959163<\/a><br>I&#039;ve heard a lot of crazy theories on the Bermuda Triangle. One was that there was some kind of astral gate at the bottom of the ocean there and that people were getting teleported to other worlds. Another was that there was some pyramid-like structure at the bottom from the ruins of Atlantis causing electromagnetic interference or something like that. I remember one that even said that massive typhoons were rising from the ocean and swallowing up the planes. The problem with it all is that the theories are wildly different and don&#039;t make enough sense to really be all that justifiable. Plus if you consider the amount of disappearances in other regions of the ocean, they&#039;re aren&#039;t necessarily more common in the Bermuda triangle then they are anywhere else. Not entirely certain on this subject, but that&#039;s my input.","time":1492667589,"resto":121957467,"id":"NE1vj53O","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121960457,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)01:56:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121960136\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121960136<\/a><br>brb going to take a piss while OP googles cuz he&#039;s a LARPer","time":1492667767,"resto":121957467,"id":"1ACK9URF","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121960834,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)02:00:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121957467\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121957467<\/a><br>antarctica\/ufo\/nazi connection<br><br>Credit\/Usury as a form of control of nations<br><br>pizzagate","time":1492668008,"resto":121957467,"id":"yDgzuhR9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

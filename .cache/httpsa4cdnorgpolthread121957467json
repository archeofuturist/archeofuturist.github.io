Like I believe that humans have &quot;energy&#039;, but I don&#039;t know to what extent or what exactly that means for us. The thing about spirit science is that it can&#039;t back up a lot of its claims with anything tangible. I feel like jews were really form outer space that they wouldn&#039;t be able to interbreed with anyone. It seems very unlikely that aliens would be that genetically identical to us.","time":1492678915,"resto":121957467,"id":"NE1vj53O","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121973988,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)05:04:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121973454\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121973454<\/a><br>I truly don&#039;t think aliens have much at all to do with us, if you looked down at earth and saw a bunch of SJW&#039;s walking around you&#039;d probably wouldn&#039;t want anywhere near this place.

Especially trauma based mind control. American politicians probably saw this as fucked up but still very useful. You also have the mentality that if you don&#039;t use it, then your enemies will. So with operation Paper Clip the took in a lot of these Nazi scientists and put their research into work for the CIA program MKultra. Monarch is a project of MKultra that deals with breaking someone down mentally and rebuilding them into a different person. Trauma based mind control was the emphasis in this circumstance. The idea behind it was that you could make spies who didn&#039;t even know that they were spies. From what I gathered though, that part didn&#039;t really work, but it probably did help them learn better techniques for less extreme forms of propaganda.","time":1492679888,"resto":121957467,"id":"NE1vj53O","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121977671,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)05:55:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"What alien\/ufo sightings are real.<br><br>Are ghosts real?<br><br>Why was weed criminalized everywhere","time":1492682137,"resto":121957467,"id":"s7B\/qWrE","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":121978173,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)06:01:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121957467\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121957467<\/a><br>What belief system do the Freemasons subscribe to and what do they do?","time":1492682518,"resto":121957467,"id":"\/UeBNmgQ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

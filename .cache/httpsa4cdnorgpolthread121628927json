The final red pill is that we&#039;re the bad guys. Hear me out on this one. Everyone knows the demographic shifts are against us, the IQ in some European countries has already dropped &quot;due to biological reasons&quot;, and it isn&#039;t hard to look at the new borns in the US to see that even without mass migration (which is still happening), in one generation the US is going to be a very different place. There&#039;s no way to reverse this change at this point. Trump&#039;s victory was, indeed, the death throes of a people losing power in their own country. It doesn&#039;t matter if Trump deports 100% of illegal immigrants, there are more minority children than majority being born right now. And these, for the most part, aren&#039;t high IQ asians. What&#039;s more is there won&#039;t be any happening that ignites a race war, or some other delusion 90% of \/pol\/ believes in. All that will happen is the decaying of our morals and economy, ever so slowly, just as its been happening since the early 60s. People&#039;s hours will increase, wages decrease, cost of living go up, vacation less, retire later... sound familiar? No memes are going to change anything. America&#039;s culture people and culture and being displaced, and without its people so goes its greatness.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;inb4 defeatist \/ shill<\/span><br>Neither of those things are arguments against my point. Why won&#039;t \/pol\/ take the final red pill and realize that we&#039;re the bad guys, because we&#039;re going to lose, and history is always written by the victor.","filename":"Doutzen-Kroes-Most-Beautiful-Dutch-Woman-364x205","ext":".jpg","w":364,"h":205,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1492485043143,"time":1492485043,"md5":"2+6p72COEcmyHNcomrRfLg==","fsize":13708,"resto":0,"id":"GZ2a35j5","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-final-red-pill","country_name":"United States","replies":5,"images":0,"unique_ips":6},{"no":121629081,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)23:12:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121628927\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121628927<\/a><br>We need to buy an island somewhere and just make a colony of just white people","time":1492485135,"resto":121628927,"id":"dSlmv8NU","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121629191,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)23:13:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121628927\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121628927<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;bad guys<\/span><br><br>what are you?

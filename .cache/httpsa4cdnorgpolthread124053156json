They in advertisement working as an ad buyer for a company they dont care about, or theyve gone to dozens and dozens of marches and protests but despite that they still feel bad. They are profoundly unhappy. They are depressed. They suspect it has something to do with marriage and kids because when they meet their friends who are married with children they feel a combination of sorrow longing and jealousy. But they have spent so many years on the &quot;right&quot; path they feel like they cant waste that time. So they convince themselves it is still the right way to live and they try to convince other girls and young women of the same.

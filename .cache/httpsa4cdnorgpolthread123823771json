They&#039;d die off otherwise.<br>This isn&#039;t necessarily a bad thing though, and I think we can avoid a complete spiral into degenerative chaos like what befell the roman empire at its end.<br>Traps certainly cheapen the human experience and drag down the bar. It&#039;s unnatural and often seems to require normalization of, and excuses made for mental illness. <br>Men who fail at the most basic tenet of being a man, ie being a man, do nothing for the advancement of humanity.<br>HOWEVER, as objects of study and commodification, they have proven uses. <br>They make excellent case studies for doctors in various fields of medical study, driving revenue in those fields. Gender reassignment surgery is very complex and expensive, making it lucrative. Same with plastics and other cosmetic procedures.It&#039;s disgusting but the research can be useful.<br>Degenerates chose to undergo such things but as long as their money is going to medical sciences, it&#039;s positive.<br>More revenue in medicine = better society.<br><br>As fetish objects and novelty\/fantasy caricatures they&#039;re fine because again, revenue. People will always have screwy sexual fetishes so if it makes for good industry so be it.<br><br>The problem arises from the social and political aspects. Society bending over backwards to be &quot;inclusive&quot; of degeneracy is a problem. Normalizing this behavior while demonizing normal, healthy successful behaviors is dangerous and has already infected almost all aspects of western culture.<br>We have to turn this around. The source is political leftism and its mission to destroy the success of western cultural superiority. <br>If we can cripple that beyond repair we can flourish, regardless of any traps among us.","filename":"88c5ebf444a812b0934bd9f684ffb198","ext":".jpg","w":604,"h":604,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493761276235,"time":1493761276,"md5":"B5s5JkOYEONxFB5WXp3B+Q==","fsize":53899,"resto":0,"id":"CWvnl6Wu","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"thread-on-how-pol-views-the-transgender-question","country_name":"United States","replies":4,"images":1,"unique_ips":5},{"no":123823880,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)17:42:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"Is bailey jay completely bald now?","time":1493761330,"resto":123823771,"id":"mNrSlMF3","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":123823998,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)17:43:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123823771\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123823771<\/a><br>barebacking traps is not gay","filename":"shoah","ext":".jpg","w":1200,"h":850,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":88,"tim":1493761387937,"time":1493761387,"md5":"411MxO69royX+nu+SdMnKQ==","fsize":189094,"resto":123823771,"id":"7Chc1BOx","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":123824054,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)17:43:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123823771\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123823771<\/a><br>Ugly trannys should be hung.

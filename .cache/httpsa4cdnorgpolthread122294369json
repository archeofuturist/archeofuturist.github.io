Look at planned parenthood for example. It benefits far less than half the population, so why should the whole population pay for it? Furthermore, if it does benefit you, or you do want it&#039;s services to continue, you are free to organize a fund to keep it alive. Sucking money from people who don&#039;t want to pay for things to benefit you is not a right.<br>Tldr; People believe money will fall from the sky, (millionaires and billionaires), to pay for things when in reality they will pay out the ass for it because our government can&#039;t do anything efficiently.","time":1492879481,"resto":122294369,"id":"rTyrWoBk","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122296901,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)12:45:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122294369\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122294369<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Coronado<\/span><br>Same thing","time":1492879528,"resto":122294369,"id":"YoyYcIdV","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122296929,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)12:45:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122294369\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122294369<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I&#039;m on vacation in Mexico<\/span><br>you&#039;re gonna wind up chopped to pieces in an oil drum.","time":1492879543,"resto":122294369,"id":"XgMFoc\/r","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122297549,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)12:51:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122296803\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122296803<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;dude government services should be a la carte lmao<\/span><br>You are ten times cringier than any Bernout.","time":1492879891,"resto":122294369,"id":"uPeFzQ+7","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122297839,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)12:54:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122296901\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122296901<\/a><br><br>nice, what part? <br><br><a href=\"#p122296929\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122296929<\/a><br><br>I&#039;m actually in a hotel were according to the manager no mexican has ever stayed in (not because they don&#039;t allow them though)","time":1492880047,"resto":122294369,"id":"JypAWXJV","country":"MX","country_name":"Mexico"},{"no":122298065,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)12:56:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122296803\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122296803<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;roads in wyoming benefit far less than half the population so why should we build them<\/span>","time":1492880180,"resto":122294369,"id":"kh8zQlQo","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122298068,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)12:56:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122294369\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122294369<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Coronado <\/span><br>Go Islanders","time":1492880183,"resto":122294369,"id":"OLb2UT1\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122298199,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)12:57:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122298068\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122298068<\/a><br><br>Fuck Coronado...

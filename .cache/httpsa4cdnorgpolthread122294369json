Look at planned parenthood for example. It benefits far less than half the population, so why should the whole population pay for it? Furthermore, if it does benefit you, or you do want it&#039;s services to continue, you are free to organize a fund to keep it alive. Sucking money from people who don&#039;t want to pay for things to benefit you is not a right.<br>Tldr; People believe money will fall from the sky, (millionaires and billionaires), to pay for things when in reality they will pay out the ass for it because our government can&#039;t do anything efficiently.","time":1492879481,"resto":122294369,"id":"rTyrWoBk","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

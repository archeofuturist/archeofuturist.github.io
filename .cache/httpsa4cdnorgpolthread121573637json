class=\"quote\">&gt;The counter-narrative offered by the Russians and Syrians, however, has been minimized, mocked and ignored by both the American media and the Trump administration. So, too, has the very illogic of the premise being put forward to answer the question of why President Assad would risk everything by using chemical weapons against a target of zero military value, at a time when the strategic balance of power had shifted strongly in his favor. Likewise, why would Russia, which had invested considerable political capital in the disarmament of Syria\u2019s chemical weapons capability after 2013, stand by idly while the Syrian air force carried out such an attack, especially when their was such a heavy Russian military presence at the base in question at the time of the attack?<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Such analysis seems beyond the scope and comprehension of the American fourth estate. Instead, media outlets like CNN embrace at face value anything they are told by official American sources, including a particularly preposterous insinuation that Russia actually colluded in the chemical weapons attack; the aforementioned presence of Russian officers at Al Shayrat air base has been cited as evidence that Russia had to have known about Syria\u2019s chemical warfare capability, and yet did nothing to prevent the attack.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;To sustain this illogic, the American public and decision-makers make use of a sophisticated propaganda campaign involving video images and narratives provided by forces opposed to the regime of Bashar al-Assad, including organizations like the \u201cWhite Helmets,\u201d the Syrian-American Medical Society, the Aleppo Media Center, which have a history of providing slanted information designed to promote an anti-Assad message (Donald Trump has all but acknowledged that these images played a major role in his decision to reevaluate his opinion of Bashar al-Assad and order the cruise missile attack on Al Shayrat airbase.)<\/span><br><br>Huffpo already covered this quite well.","filename":"1492114227498","ext":".gif","w":500,"h":370,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":92,"tim":1492460537548,"time":1492460537,"md5":"hfzxWLo7qXmEdeQciMpJtw==","fsize":1974322,"resto":121573637,"id":"wa3RDRPu","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121575818,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)16:22:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121575466\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121575466<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121574699\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121574699<\/a><br>I love this thread.<br><br>Also, (((MIT))) (((Professor))).","time":1492460551,"resto":121573637,"id":"BXm1qJAR","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121575867,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)16:22:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121574699\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121574699<\/a><br>Elite post","filename":"1491935640877","ext":".gif","w":530,"h":291,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":68,"tim":1492460574343,"time":1492460574,"md5":"+vj5cP5xO7VjiJr7daVABQ==","fsize":1597450,"resto":121573637,"id":"4hT\/cug+","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121575876,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)16:22:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"QUICK RUNDOWN REQUEST<br><br>State all the evidence FOR and AGAINST Assad being responsible for the chemical attack.","time":1492460576,"resto":121573637,"id":"B8Hngcyf","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121575931,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)16:23:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121573637\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121573637<\/a><br>STOP HACKING US PROFESSORS RUUUSSIAAAAAA!","time":1492460604,"resto":121573637,"id":"mzrq\/8yd","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":121576053,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)16:24:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121573637\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121573637<\/a><br>MIT and Caltech are the only university I trust, fuck.","time":1492460648,"resto":121573637,"id":"tZfUBJ+9","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":121576073,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)16:24:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121573637\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121573637<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;degree in physics<\/span><br><br>Cool, that&#039;s totally relevant to the field he&#039;s shoving himself into and commenting on","time":1492460663,"resto":121573637,"id":"EkvIWSTE","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121576220,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)16:25:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121573637\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121573637<\/a><br>Trump would never lie to us, you shill.","time":1492460716,"resto":121573637,"id":"3XFOxpyw","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121576621,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)16:27:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121575867\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121575867<\/a><br>What the hell happened there?","time":1492460879,"resto":121573637,"id":"T\/BJ0p7M","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121576744,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)16:28:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121575118\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121575118<\/a><br>no scheming, never","filename":"jew_basic","ext":".jpg","w":220,"h":220,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492460936055,"time":1492460936,"md5":"lQj+uKhhZS6j+lzrGVUJ\/A==","fsize":19421,"resto":121573637,"id":"Lp6GBNq7","country":"EE","country_name":"Estonia"},{"no":121577615,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)16:34:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121573637\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121573637<\/a><br>The other place has a full dump of the pdf.","filename":"929a21f08dbf22bdd53a296e8374c4e997e8cc3f50def8abd7ea855ec83ba244","ext":".png","w":1275,"h":1650,"tn_w":96,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492461290613,"time":1492461290,"md5":"jh6yj49PDHIvzINdrkRqTQ==","fsize":1562185,"resto":121573637,"id":"5l1pcMwv","country":"IE","m_img":1,"country_name":"Ireland"},{"no":121577758,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)16:35:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;All these Trumptards ready to suck al-qaeda dick if it makes their meme man look good<\/span><br>This is some Hillary level shit you are all pulling here.

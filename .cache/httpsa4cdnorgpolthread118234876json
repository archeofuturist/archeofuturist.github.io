She would have been one of few women but she is not named in historical members lists.[6] She bought arms and ammunition at her own expense and brought them secretly to Spetses in her ships, to fight &quot;for the sake of my nation.&quot; Construction of the ship Agamemnon was finished in 1820. She bribed Turkish officials to ignore the ship&#039;s size and it was later one of the largest warships in the hands of Greek rebels. She also organized her own armed troops, composed of men from Spetses. She used most of her fortune to provide food and ammunition for the sailors and soldiers under her command.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;On 13 March 1821 Bouboulina raised on the mast of Agamemnon her own Greek flag, based on the flag of the Comnenus dynasty of Byzantine emperors. The people of Spetses revolted on 3 April and later joined forces with ships from other Greek islands. Bouboulina sailed with eight ships to Nafplion and began a naval blockade. Later she took part in the naval blockade and capture of Monemvasia and Pylos.[citation needed] Her son Yiannis Yiannouzas died in May 1821, in battle at Argos against superior numbers of Ottoman troops.<\/span>","filename":"images-e1458847637905","ext":".jpg","w":394,"h":454,"tn_w":108,"tn_h":124,"tim":1490460964827,"time":1490460964,"md5":"C8T2ARO09H7H0q+IEtaKpA==","fsize":26323,"resto":118234876,"id":"Kuzq90Oa","country":"CY","country_name":"Cyprus"},{"no":118244030,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)12:56:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118243621\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118243621<\/a><br>Cutest boy I&#039;ve ever seen then.

There are stinkers in every generation, Gen Xers and Baby Boomers just so happen to have more and that&#039;s what make them shitty generations. Pretty much everything Millennials are blamed for is a product of Baby Boomers and Gen Xers. Stuff like not allowing children to fail, everyone gets trophies, etc. all originate with Baby Boomers when they tried to be the opposite of the Greatest Generation. Generation Z will work the same way: they will be the opposite of the last three generations (Millennials, Gen Xers, and Baby Boomers) because the downsides are becoming very obvious.","time":1492326650,"resto":121330912,"id":"TvWh4d1C","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121332131,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)03:12:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121330912\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121330912<\/a><br>&quot;Generation Z&quot; is literally half nigger they aren&#039;t saving anything","time":1492326730,"resto":121330912,"id":"ndGs2i20","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121332142,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)03:12:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"Non-LGBT Gen Zers are based, the problem is, the LGBT faggots are increasing as a proportion with each successive year","filename":"LGBT Millenial Vote","ext":".png","w":626,"h":616,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":123,"tim":1492326722013,"time":1492326722,"md5":"IXByngAjZb9Wg4DJsb7Sdw==","fsize":30464,"resto":121330912,"id":"NWasR4bn","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121332184,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)03:12:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121330912\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121330912<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;tfw know I will retire with a based generation taking care of me at the old folk&#039;s home<\/span>","time":1492326779,"resto":121330912,"id":"+96zW7fK","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]}

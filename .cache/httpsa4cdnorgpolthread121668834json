Semi-Pelagianism said this: yes, there was a fall; yes, there is such a thing as original sin; yes, the constituent nature of humanity has been changed by this state of corruption and all parts of our humanity have been significantly weakened by the fall, so much so that without the assistance of divine grace nobody can possibly be redeemed, so that grace is not only helpful but it\u2019s absolutely necessary for salvation. While we are so fallen that we can\u2019t be saved without grace, we are not so fallen that we don\u2019t have the ability to accept or reject the grace when it\u2019s offered to us. The will is weakened but is not enslaved. There remains in the core of our being an island of righteousness that remains untouched by the fall. It\u2019s out of that little island of righteousness, that little parcel of goodness that is still intact in the soul or in the will that is the determinative difference between heaven and hell. It\u2019s that little island that must be exercised when God does his thousand steps of reaching out to us, but in the final analysis it\u2019s that one step that we take that determines whether we go to heaven or hell \u2014 whether we exercise that little righteousness that is in the core of our being or whether we don\u2019t.

In the near future humans may have the opportunity to colonize other planets and therefore survive &quot;mundane&quot; extinction events localized to Earth. Now, I&#039;ve talked to Americans who say Christians should never be astronauts, because they might miss the rapture if they&#039;re outside Earth&#039;s atmosphere, but I&#039;m sure everyone here realizes that&#039;s bullshit and the whole rapture concept makes no sense anyway. But it got me thinking.<br><br>Let&#039;s suppose humans in the future have difficulty making other planets hospitable to terrestrial life, and in the long run find it more practical to build habitats in space. These structures would require diligent maintenance by their own residents, and over the course of generations, a tradition would build up around this and have a powerful influence on people&#039;s culture. In a vacuum (heh) this would naturally develop into its own kind of religion.<br><br>My question is this: Do you think Christianity could comfortably incorporate such traditions and adapt itself in the long run to life in space, or is it naturally in competition with traditions that make other demands? If the latter, do you believe it&#039;s better for the human species to just blow itself up here on Earth and avoid any possibility of Christianity dying out and being replaced?

What is the source and status of faith? Is it the God-given means whereby the God-given justification is received? Or is it a condition of justification which is left to us to fulfill? Is your faith a work? Is it the one work that God leaves for you to do? I had a discussion with some folks in Grand Rapids, Michigan, recently.

I did the right thing and my friend didn\u2019t.\u201d He knew where I was going with that question.<br><br>And he said, \u201cOh, no, no, no.\u201d<br><br>I said, \u201cTell me why. Is it because you are smarter than your friend?\u201d<br><br>And he said, \u201cNo.\u201d<br><br>But he would not agree that the final, decisive issue was the grace of God. He wouldn\u2019t come to that. And after we discussed this for fifteen minutes, he said, \u201cOK! I\u2019ll say it. I\u2019m a Christian because I did the right thing, I made the right response, and my friend didn\u2019t.\u201d<br><br>What was this person trusting in for his salvation?

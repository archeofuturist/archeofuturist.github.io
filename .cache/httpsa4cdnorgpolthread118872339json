By 1922, Jews accounted for 21.5 percent of freshmen, up from 7 percent in 1900 and vastly more than at Yale or Princeton. In the Ivy League, only Columbia and the University of Pennsylvania had a greater proportion of Jews.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Harvard\u2019s president, A. Lawrence Lowell, warned that the \u201cJewish invasion\u201d would \u201cruin the college.\u201d He wanted a cap: 15 percent. When faculty members balked, he stacked the admissions process to achieve the same result. Bolstered by the nativism of the time, which led to sharp immigration restrictions, Harvard\u2019s admissions committee began using the euphemistic criteria of \u201ccharacter and fitness\u201d to limit Jewish enrollment. As the sociologist Jerome Karabel has documented, these practices worked for the next three decades to suppress the number of Jewish students.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;A similar injustice is at work today, against Asian-Americans. To get into the top schools, they need SAT scores that are about 140 points higher than those of their white peers. In 2008, over half of all applicants to Harvard with exceptionally high SAT scores were Asian, yet they made up only 17 percent of the entering class (now 20 percent). Asians are the fastest-growing racial group in America, but their proportion of Harvard undergraduates has been flat for two decades.<\/span>","time":1490845169,"resto":118872339,"id":"i7uOFyuz","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118877327,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)23:40:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"I cared so much about where I went to college when I was younger.

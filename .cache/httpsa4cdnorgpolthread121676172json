The Texas Rangers took over the investigation earlier this month to ensure impartiality since many of the victims, perpetrators and members of law enforcement know each other intimately, reported the San Antonio Express-News.<br><br>The State Attorney General\u2019s office will prosecute the cases.<br><br>\u201cHazing is done in high schools and colleges all over the country,\u201d Ritchey told the Express-News. \u201cBut not to this point.\u201d<br><br>And the public controversy \u2014 and division \u2014 surrounding the investigation only escalated this week when three 18-year-old senior basketball players were arrested and charged with second-degree felony sexual assault for allegedly sodomizing a 15-year-old with a flashlight at a home in February near La Vernia, reported local news outlets.<br><br>The arrests, which raised the total to 13, came just one day after the parents of one alleged victim filed a federal civil rights lawsuit against the La Vernia Independent School District and officials for enabling a \u201cpersistent \u2018rape culture\u2019\u201d within the football program.","filename":"LaVernia","ext":".jpg","w":960,"h":540,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1492516696561,"time":1492516696,"md5":"YhhyL6fQD9KXMWGmX9hRQQ==","fsize":129707,"resto":0,"id":"KTPZdmGb","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"13-football-teens-arrested-for-sodomy-and-rape-in","country_name":"United States","replies":6,"images":2,"unique_ips":6},{"no":121676348,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)08:00:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"Ok at what point does giving the freshmen shit for being freshmen cross over into &quot;hehehe put this in his butt &quot;","time":1492516818,"resto":121676172,"id":"mOmIPFy7","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121676889,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)08:05:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121676172\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121676172<\/a><br>bump","time":1492517155,"resto":121676172,"id":"BrxVgrxH","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121677008,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)08:07:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121676172\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121676172<\/a><br>(((Football teens)))","filename":"IMG_1894","ext":".jpg","w":700,"h":633,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":113,"tim":1492517228464,"time":1492517228,"md5":"vShdWDos+p0z7G\/N+cl+Xw==","fsize":112537,"resto":121676172,"id":"JIUXk5LL","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121677068,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)08:07:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121677008\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121677008<\/a><br>From looking up the school it looks like at least some arrested were Hispanic teens, but none are Black.","time":1492517264,"resto":121676172,"id":"KTPZdmGb","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121677249,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)08:09:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121676172\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121676172<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;three 18-year-old senior basketball players<\/span><br>so...niggers?<br><br>but seriously how does this shit get to the gay insertion point? who&#039;s the guy that first makes that suggestion? <br>Where is the jump from duct taping a guy to the goal post to homo-sodomy?","filename":"1449174195988","ext":".jpg","w":400,"h":509,"tn_w":98,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492517394136,"time":1492517394,"md5":"z4xnggx11oFbqZUqSgRYdw==","fsize":45072,"resto":121676172,"id":"Hl8pAQu7","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121677643,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)08:14:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121677068\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121677068<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;but none are Black.<\/span><br><br>No wonder \/pol\/ is ignoring this thread.

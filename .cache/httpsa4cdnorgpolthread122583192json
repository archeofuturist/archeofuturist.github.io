As I was reading this, I was thinking that Germany needs a happening, a very big one, almost like 9\/11-tier big. Unless there won&#039;t be a big happening, nothing will change. <br><br>Why? Because a big happening will put more strain on the overwhelmed safety nets, poor social cohesion and strained police forces and bring about some chaos in the city areas, creating a situation that could be capitalized by some right-wing forces to take action. Maybe kill a bunch of minorities, maybe a bunch commies, maybe even straight up revolution, but they could freely be able to make something happen once government stops breathing down their necks for even the tiniest moment.","time":1493043648,"resto":122583192,"id":"6WgeDX48","country":"EE","country_name":"Estonia"},{"no":122590687,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)10:22:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122583192\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122583192<\/a><br>so it&#039;s like R\u00f6hm?","filename":"R\u00f6hm","ext":".jpg","w":567,"h":800,"tn_w":88,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493043753236,"time":1493043753,"md5":"uhaOktEq2sFDV74VN3SbHQ==","fsize":130068,"resto":122583192,"id":"F8ZIjj6a","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":122590821,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)10:24:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122584099\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122584099<\/a><br>I guess the government hasn&#039;t been paying antifa enough.","time":1493043849,"resto":122583192,"id":"03bt\/pGj","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"},{"no":122591384,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)10:30:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122587985\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122587985<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;But those parties had time to grow<\/span><br>You think you guys don&#039;t?<br>In October the Turkish Visa deal is to be certified. <br>The EU has three choices:<br>1.

Combat goes on in region Voronej, near Don, in the south, and at the gates of the Northern Caucasus. The German invaders penetrate toward Stalingrad, to Volga and want at any cost to trap Kuban and the Northern Caucasus, with their oil and grain. The enemy already has captured Vorochilovgrad, Starobelsk, Rossosh, Kupyansk, Valuyki, Novochercassk, Rostov on Don, half Voronej. Part of the troops of the Southern front, following the panic-mongers, have left Rostov and Novochercassk without severe resistance and without orders from Moscow, covering their banners with shame.The population of our country, who love and respect the Red Army, start to be discouraged in her, and lose faith in the Red Army, and many curse the Red Army for leaving our people under the yoke of the German oppressors, and itself running east....<\/span>","filename":"image","ext":".jpg","w":1200,"h":875,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":182,"tim":1493339249038,"time":1493339249,"md5":"rNrtWsUTOM+YE\/9f9\/a+gQ==","fsize":130403,"resto":0,"id":"zDW1eC5r","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"is-order-no-227-the-bestwritten-war-document-or","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":1},{"no":123116577,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)20:27:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123116551\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123116551<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;.....Some stupid people at the front calm themselves with talk that we can retreat further to the east, as we have a lot of territory, a lot of ground, a lot of population and that there will always be much bread for us. They want to justify the infamous behavior at the front. But such talk is falsehood, helpful only to our enemies.Each commander, Red Army soldier and political commissar should understand that our means are not limitless. The territory of the Soviet state is not a desert, but people - workers, peasants, intelligentsia, our fathers, mothers, wives, brothers, children. The territory of the USSR which the enemy has captured and aims to capture is bread and other products for the army, metal and fuel for industry, factories, plants supplying the army with arms and ammunition, railroads. After the loss of Ukraine, Belarus, Baltic republics, Donetzk, and other areas we have much less territory, much less people, bread, metal, plants and factories. We have lost more than 70 million people, more than 800 million pounds of bread annually and more than 10 million tons of metal annually. Now we do not have predominance over the Germans in human reserves, in reserves of bread. To retreat further - means to waste ourselves and to waste at the same time our Motherland.Therefore it is necessary to eliminate talk that we have the capability endlessly to retreat, that we have a lot of territory, that our country is great and rich, that there is a large population, and that bread always will be abundant. Such talk is false and parasitic, it weakens us and benefits the enemy, if we do not stop retreating we will be without bread, without fuel, without metal, without raw material, without factories and plants, without railroads.,<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;This leads to the conclusion, it is time to finish retreating. Not one step back! Such should now be our main slogan.&quot;<\/span>","time":1493339266,"resto":123116551,"id":"zDW1eC5r","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

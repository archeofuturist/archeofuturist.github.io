It worsen if she gives birth to children. <br>(2): money: she will use her money and you money and complain why you don&#039;t make more. Personal experience here with a girlfriend I dumped. Thank god I didn&#039;t marry her.<br>(3) space: woman tend to see man activities as bad for the family, like playing games, go out to drink a beer with friends, play soccer, etc. They expect you to serve them. Moreover, you usually have to deal with shit like the roof, garbage, garage etc. So a big nope here.<br>(4) Divorce: they can divorce for any reason and get away with your money and family pretty easily. If you betray her, you get to pay alimony; if she betrays you, you get to pay alimony. If you have kids, then your problems got even worse. She can pretend some sex harassment, rape, violence and get away with it. Woman tend to get child custody in 90% of the cases and they can put them against you pretty easily.

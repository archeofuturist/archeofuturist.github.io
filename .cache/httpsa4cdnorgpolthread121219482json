They have to memorize thousands of symbols that have one meaning, and as a result written language suffers because many Chinese characters have more than one meaning so the only way to know what is being said in a written statement is to know the context. Furthermore, Chinese, Koreans, and Japanese people commonly don&#039;t develop a sufficient level of literacy to read a newspaper until secondary school because of how appallingly inefficient their languages are.","filename":"chinese hieroglyphs","ext":".png","w":1280,"h":889,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":173,"tim":1492269335753,"time":1492269335,"md5":"dQ8ixhCHTJr\/ucFIF4GHUw==","fsize":85258,"resto":0,"id":"q\/LXcFVk","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"why-do-chinese-people-write-in-hieroglyphs","country_name":"Canada","replies":18,"images":0,"unique_ips":17},{"no":121219542,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)11:16:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121219482\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121219482<\/a><br>Why are you talking shit about your native language?","time":1492269370,"resto":121219482,"id":"pOXk6N+5","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121219585,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)11:16:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121219542\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121219542<\/a><br>FPBP","time":1492269397,"resto":121219482,"id":"uuLyInRm","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121219619,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)11:16:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121219542\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121219542<\/a><br>Kek","time":1492269418,"resto":121219482,"id":"c9adUyge","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121219674,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)11:17:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"Tbh as an English speaker I think we only have so much room to complain about something as simple as moonrunes.<br><br>If you can&#039;t learn them you&#039;re a brainlet.","time":1492269456,"resto":121219482,"id":"jINHi5bf","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121219694,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)11:17:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121219482\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121219482<\/a><br>We don&#039;t need this thread again","time":1492269469,"resto":121219482,"id":"nKSxbMeR","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121219695,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)11:17:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121219482\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121219482<\/a><br>Korean and Japanese have pseudo-alphabets,it&#039;s really just Chinese that&#039;s retarded<br><br>t.chink","time":1492269470,"resto":121219482,"id":"E3o01jAf","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121220945,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)11:30:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121219482\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121219482<\/a><br>After the WWII, americans thought japanese writing system wasn&#039;t democratic.

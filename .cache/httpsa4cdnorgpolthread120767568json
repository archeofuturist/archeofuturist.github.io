I know the japs and koreans like to do lots of weird science experiments all the time, have they discovered anything? The most I&#039;ve heard is from google searches, and most terrifyingly, one of my own friends in a church group I&#039;m with. He said that in his time in the medical profession he talked to a man who was once legally declared dead for a full 15 minutes - He said he felt his conciousness slowly fading away as he drifted into an infinite darkness, and feeling nothing but the most crippling and terrifying loneliness he had ever felt, so much so he would have preferred to have seen an actual Hell.<br><br>So, is there anything on life after death?","filename":"life-after-death-what-happens-spirit-leaving-body","ext":".jpg","w":1400,"h":735,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":131,"tim":1492010910970,"time":1492010910,"md5":"cS7A3LvyMnrw7MeuwzZhcA==","fsize":255330,"resto":0,"id":"pOH1Hx3O","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"life-after-death","country_name":"United States","replies":19,"images":2,"unique_ips":15},{"no":120768087,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)11:33:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;He said he felt his conciousness slowly fading away as he drifted into an infinite darkness, and feeling nothing but the most crippling and terrifying loneliness he had ever felt, so much so he would have preferred to have seen an actual Hell<\/span><br><br>This is just normie\u00b4s point of view.

Maybe not.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;and arrogant to think that everyone all over the world thruout all of time are wrong.<\/span><br>Now this is definitely incorrect. Throughout the history of mankind, there have been many various religions and beliefs. The Greeks had their pantheon, as did the Romans, the Egyptians, the Norse, and the Japanese. The Indians had Hinduism and their gods, and the varying Native Tribes of America each had their own separate beliefs, though all based around a common core (similar to the Amharic faiths).<br><br>However, very few of these are practiced today. Many were stamped out completely and the few that weren&#039;t aren&#039;t practiced on the scale of modern Christianity or Islam. They have been so thoroughly destroyed that they are now considered only myth. From Zeus to Amaterasu, these beings that once had temples carved in their names, now exist only as tales for our amusement.<br><br>From this, we can disprove your point about it being arrogant to believe everyone around the world throughout all of time was wrong. After all, if people in the past were wrong about their beliefs, and many of them were, then it would be logical to assume Christianity is the same. In fact, one could argue it&#039;s arrogant to assume Christianity is the one true religion Since it doesn&#039;t appear all that special compared to the myths and tales of Old.","time":1492012114,"resto":120767568,"id":"+iMRwOSQ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120770122,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)11:52:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120768134\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120768134<\/a><br>You can no more prove that than a religious person can prove their claims.","time":1492012369,"resto":120767568,"id":"JgS\/ezWp","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120770160,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)11:53:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"We go closer to death when we sleep at night, just sort of dipping your toe into what the afterlife is.<br><br>If our brain frequency is high, consciousness is very concentrated into the brain, when it gets lower, it becomes more detached from the brain.<br><br>This is why people can have out of body experiences when they get into deep meditation or in some stages of sleep.<br><br>N,N-Dimethyltryptamine is used in the brain as an analog tuner and when we die, enough is released to completely disconnect consciousness from the brain.<br><br>So really, when people have a DMT breakthrough experience, they are actually just experiencing death.","time":1492012393,"resto":120767568,"id":"EOySkwBC","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120770238,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)11:53:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120770122\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120770122<\/a><br>I&#039;m pretty sure organ donation is a well known fact.","time":1492012433,"resto":120767568,"id":"+iMRwOSQ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120770243,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)11:53:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120768256\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120768256<\/a><br>Anecdotes are not evidence.","time":1492012435,"resto":120767568,"id":"JgS\/ezWp","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120770374,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)11:55:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120767568\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120767568<\/a><br>There&#039;s a reasonably compelling case to be made that Jesus was resurrected, just check out William Lane Craig on the resurrection<br><br>if that&#039;s true, there must be some sort of afterlife","time":1492012507,"resto":120767568,"id":"LEn3VQoM","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":120771252,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)12:03:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120768313\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120768313<\/a><br>What about 4-5","time":1492012980,"resto":120767568,"id":"jFMvdsyH","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120771744,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)12:07:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120768477\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120768477<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;haha lots of people can&#039;t all be wrong at the same time lol <\/span><br>kys so you can go hang out with god","time":1492013249,"resto":120767568,"id":"J2D9NmE1","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120772429,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)12:13:13","name":"Sage","com":"<a href=\"\/x\/\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;&gt;\/x\/<\/a>","time":1492013593,"resto":120767568,"id":"3h0yghyI","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120772475,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)12:13:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"Ask the yogis or somebody else who claims to be enlightened.

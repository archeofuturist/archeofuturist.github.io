I do not believe this as I have no proof. This is just purely for speculation and discussion. <br><br>In recent times there have been a whole slew of treaties making Antarctica a no go area. These are all done under the guise of environmental protection, but the fact that the superpowers are mainly pushing this, we know they are putting a lock down on Antarctica for other reasons. Oil, weapons? We can only speculate.<br><br>At the same time, this Flat Earth psy-op shows up which claims that Antarctica does not exist as such. I think the two concepts are too closely linked in time and topic to not be unrelated.<br><br>The Piri Reis map clearly shows an accurate topography of Antarctica WITHOUT ICE. This is still one of the greatest anomalies in world history which has still not been fully explained away.<br><br>What if the superpowers discovered an entire ancient civilisation (s) beneath the Antarctic ice sheet which would destroy all their historical, human and evolutionary timelines? That the discoveries down there being so monumental that to let them out to the public would undermine all confidence in sciences and especially climate studies and geological accepted paradigms?<br><br>What better way to hide this than create a counter culture of buffoons who think the earth is flat and Antarctica does not exist... Then feed them the &#039;proof&#039; with all the treaties so instead of an alternative movement wanting to know what is down there, they get their morons to claim the earth is flat and Antarctica - along with the Piri Reis map - is all fake","time":1490718385,"resto":118664036,"id":"qphmoCut","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"},{"no":118665333,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)12:27:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"74\u00b010\u201930.48\u2033S 164\u00b055\u201945.45\u2033E","time":1490718462,"resto":118664036,"id":"y6tV6CXA","country":"CL","country_name":"Chile"},{"no":118665418,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)12:28:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118665199\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118665199<\/a><br>Atlast a truly see","time":1490718503,"resto":118664036,"id":"PX4xJNws","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118665543,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)12:29:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118665199\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118665199<\/a><br>I don&#039;t think the Piri Reis map shows Antarctica.

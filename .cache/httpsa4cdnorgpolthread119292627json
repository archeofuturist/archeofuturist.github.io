Would you just expect them to sit idle and accept the situation? That is exactly what happened to the Germans and they&#039;re just expected to deal with it and move on. <br><br>This whole idea of borders now being nonnegotiable is ridiculous. Borders changed almost constantly in Europe for thousands of years but just because Germany happened to be on the losing side of the last significant European war they&#039;re supposed to accept the cards they&#039;ve been dealt with now and forever?<br><br>Personally I don&#039;t think it would be outrageous at all if Germany one day demanded the Eastern half of their country back. Germany doesn&#039;t simply lose its causa belli just because the Americans\/Russians forced their politicians to bend over after the war. And 70 years is not a lot of time in historical standards.","filename":"koenigsberg_then_and_now","ext":".jpg","w":630,"h":506,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":200,"tim":1491195374609,"time":1491195374,"md5":"TCwJgKI3706B9Zw5N3\/gsA==","fsize":89879,"resto":0,"id":"\/gUwINkK","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"germany-has-every-right-to-demand-prussia","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":119292944,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)00:59:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119292627\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119292627<\/a><br>We never give up.

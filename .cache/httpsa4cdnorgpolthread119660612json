Why?<br><br>Remember the Spartans, and their practice of throwing &#039;undesirables&#039; off of cliffs. I, for one, consider our civilization to be a degenerated revenant of Greece and Rome...but I digress. <br><br>Should we kill the deformed at birth? What about the severely handicapped, like the mental retards, who are only a drain on our society? Should they be aborted before birth? <br><br>Should we euthanize the mentally ill?

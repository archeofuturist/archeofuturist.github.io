The primitive poo men of the period beleived that by eating the poo of other animals they would have double poo, a stronger, denser form of poo. In actual fact the high poo diet of the poo men caused severe bodily failures, such as forcing minerals to be flushed out of their body. The poo did indeed become fortified, but it was because it contained so much calcium from their skeletons and iron from their blood. The emaciated and severely mentally ill poo men became unable to feel pain or disgust and would consume alarming amounts of poo and poo way too much. They had half the life expectancy of their manland counterparts, and would shrink back to the size of children before they had fully reached maturity, and due to their perseverance the fortified pooey chalk ridge would remain around 1000 years longer that it would have naturally. Diving teams have found remains of the poo ridge at the bottom of the channel, several miles long, made entirely out of fortified semi metallic fortified poo man poo, and great monolithic statues depicting the poos of many different animals of which the poo was eaten by the poo men, such as badgers, poo eagles, jellyfish, horses, cows, wolves, seagulls, cats and spiders. One of the poo statues, depicting a spider poo, is 200 feet tall and weights several tousand tons.<\/span>","time":1490909517,"resto":118967349,"id":"1jZPl9qK","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118971810,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)17:32:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118971194\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118971194<\/a><br><a href=\"#p118971327\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118971327<\/a><br><br>No yachts or pizza involved, just stupid things you do when your 19 or 20 and in a foreign land with the lads.","time":1490909523,"resto":118967349,"id":"VTkIgQSs","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118971811,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)17:32:03","name":"WN","com":"<a href=\"#p118970800\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118970800<\/a><br>That&#039;s alright lad.","time":1490909523,"resto":118967349,"id":"sg01Gil6","country":"GB","trip":"!!XKy4PC1RH+2","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118971824,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)17:32:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118970285\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118970285<\/a><br>Thanks for that.","time":1490909532,"resto":118967349,"id":"Fmj98aFh","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118971843,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)17:32:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118971327\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118971327<\/a><br>No!<br>God damn newfag. <br><br>The famous Racist Leicester Thai Orgy","time":1490909541,"resto":118967349,"id":"C5QsHnL5","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118971890,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)17:32:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"Alright you neet dyel faggots let this fit sand woman teach you how to lift.

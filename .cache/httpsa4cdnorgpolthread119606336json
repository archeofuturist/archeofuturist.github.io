I guess they&#039;re just as dull witted as the rest of us, having to rely on idea crutches take straight from the dullest franchises in the history of movie franchises. Seriously each episode following the boy wizard and his pals from Hogwarts Academy as they fight assorted villains has been indistinguishable from the others. Aside from the gloomy imagery, the series\u2019 only consistency has been its lack of excitement and ineffective use of special effects, all to make magic unmagical, to make action seem inert.<br><br>Perhaps the die was cast when Rowling vetoed the idea of Spielberg directing the series; she made sure the series would never be mistaken for a work of art that meant anything to anybody, just ridiculously profitable cross-promotion for her books. The Harry Potter series might be anti-Christian (or not), but it\u2019s certainly the anti-James Bond series in its refusal of wonder, beauty and excitement. No one wants to face that fact. Now, thankfully, they no longer have to.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;a-at least the books were good though<\/span><br>&quot;No!&quot;<br>The writing is dreadful; the book was terrible. As I read, I noticed that every time a character went for a walk, the author wrote instead that the character &quot;stretched his legs.&quot;<br><br>I began marking on the back of an envelope every time that phrase was repeated. I stopped only after I had marked the envelope several dozen times. I was incredulous. Rowling&#039;s mind is so governed by cliches and dead metaphors that she has no other style of writing. Later I read a lavish, loving review of Harry Potter by the same Stephen King. He wrote something to the effect of, &quot;If these kids are reading Harry Potter at 11 or 12, then when they get older they will go on to read Stephen King.&quot; And he was quite right. He was not being ironic. When you read &quot;Harry Potter&quot; you are, in fact, trained to read Stephen King.","filename":"potter","ext":".jpg","w":1596,"h":2850,"tn_w":70,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491401249446,"time":1491401249,"md5":"18UHPhXvkYHfAyNAG6C\/Dw==","fsize":1236233,"resto":119606336,"id":"aFuD5WjZ","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":119609410,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)10:07:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119606419\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119606419<\/a><br>OY VEY!","filename":"oy vey","ext":".png","w":335,"h":457,"tn_w":91,"tn_h":124,"tim":1491401272789,"time":1491401272,"md5":"13EbB1xXYHnNBQ+g7XQ9TQ==","fsize":293639,"resto":119606336,"id":"EMwCFUE2","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":119609530,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)10:09:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119609374\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119609374<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Shit-tier<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Lord of the rings<\/span><br>Get out of this board shitskin.","time":1491401355,"resto":119606336,"id":"FDxg3lhT","country":"IT","country_name":"Italy"},{"no":119609531,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)10:09:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119606419\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119606419<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;nothing but Jews and Niggers and one chink<\/span>","time":1491401355,"resto":119606336,"id":"8cWvGXq6","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":119609581,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)10:09:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119606671\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119606671<\/a><br>That&#039;s how Marxism works.

Our economy is going to need way more qualified tradesmen, particularly when it comes to maintaining and repairing our crumbling infrastructure.","time":1491404847,"resto":119606336,"id":"++cmODHG","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119614745,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)11:07:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119612379\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119612379<\/a><br>Seems like everyday we get an email about diversity and there are posters all around about shit like rape culture or women working in the age of trump.

And if you ignore the SJW attachment to the series as it is written, it comes off as an indictment of modern politics. The wizard government is an incompetent authoritarian government that denies anything is actually wrong and actively persecutes anyone who says otherwise. Voldemort, who get held up as a Hitler analog is more like an outside invader that wants to take over while the incompetent government denies there&#039;s even a problem. One bit that stands out is when a state appointed teacher who is supposed to be teaching defensive magic tells the students they don&#039;t need to learn defensive magic, because there&#039;s no threat. And if there were, the government would protect them. (Why do you need a gun, goy? the police will protect you.) Dumbledore&#039;s army wasn&#039;t formed to fight the government. It was formed to fight the outside threat the government refused to admit even existed. I&#039;m not saying the books are entirely red pilled, but it takes some serious mental gymnastics to see them as promoting leftist ideology. As for Rowling herself, we&#039;ll, she likes money, and the SJWs have all but hijacked nerd culture.

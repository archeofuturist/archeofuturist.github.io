Asian mothers know they can \u201csell\u201d their Eurasian babies\u2019 faces, but we have significantly less value in the west, but in the Orient we are considered \u201cnovel\u201d and unique looking.<br><br>This is typical of WMAW narcissist helicopter parents, who use their half-Asian \u201csuperior\u201d babies as a means to pad their egos, by forcing us into acting roles or TV roles when we\u2019re young. You need to understand Asian culture to get why\u2026. Asian culture is extremely status-bent.

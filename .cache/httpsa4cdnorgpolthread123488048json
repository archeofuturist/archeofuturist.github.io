So your saying that every rich white man is racist and trying to make sure that black men are poor for? Look at how stupid that sounds. Considering that you speak like capitalism is the devil you probably are a marxist of some sort so I will ask you this. When the grades for students are <a href=\"#p123488238\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123488238<\/a> do you expect them to share the same income level? Also there is the fact that Asians make more median income than Whites do so that must mean capitalism is really racist or something. It&#039;s not like a culture that encourages you to fuck the system and that studies are less important for you. This is obviously a generalization, but I think it&#039;s hard to disagree that these elements are present.<br><br>https:\/\/www.statista.com\/statistics<wbr>\/233324\/median-household-income-in-<wbr>the-united-states-by-race-or-ethnic<wbr>-group\/","time":1493576967,"resto":123488048,"id":"hGaUejNz","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123507344,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)14:30:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123488048\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123488048<\/a>","filename":"Screen Shot 2017-04-24 at 1.25.18 PM","ext":".png","w":687,"h":260,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":47,"tim":1493577044161,"time":1493577044,"md5":"65WZ3hEujpHY2SkLJPB1dg==","fsize":41376,"resto":123488048,"id":"XApHqfIf","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123507415,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)14:31:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123507344\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123507344<\/a><br>Asian BTFO all the other races","filename":"1493527142451","ext":".png","w":1150,"h":1800,"tn_w":79,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493577079623,"time":1493577079,"md5":"uX4qTqG\/cyJv\/EXe9o75+w==","fsize":1269913,"resto":123488048,"id":"XApHqfIf","country":"CA","m_img":1,"country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123507560,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)14:32:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123488048\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123488048<\/a><br>wow white peopel are raycis!!!!!!!","filename":"rmmt","ext":".png","w":1425,"h":793,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":69,"tim":1493577159136,"time":1493577159,"md5":"I4n0KeVm7sMcJUMecMfnjQ==","fsize":298768,"resto":123488048,"id":"JM\/aM5aM","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123509334,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)14:48:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123506790\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123506790<\/a><br>this statement is based entirely in your feelings and based nothing on fact.

That being said, about 33,000 people die a year in America from guns. About 66% of that 33,000 is suicide, so that doesn&#039;t really count. So 66% of 33,000 is roughly 21,000, so subtract 33,000 from 21,000 and you get 10,000. Over 8,000 of that 10,000 deaths by gun are inner city black gang members who, most of the time, obtained the gun illegally. So that leaves conservatively 2,000 - 4,000 legitimate &quot;legal gun&quot; deaths in America per year. So 3,000 people die legitimately BECAUSE of LEGAL gun ownership a year in America - in a country where over 270 million people own guns, 2,000-4,000 is even a grain of sand compared to that.<br><br>http:\/\/everytownresearch.org\/gun-vi<wbr>olence-by-the-numbers\/<br><br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Gun_v<wbr>iolence_in_the_United_States","time":1490232635,"resto":117855721,"id":"tUDWNIcj","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117865763,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)21:36:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"Based 1 post by this ID strikes again!","time":1490232999,"resto":117855721,"id":"AuNTXxFw","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117865818,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)21:37:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117864558\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117864558<\/a><br>meh - I&#039;m okay with the statement without your qualifier.","time":1490233026,"resto":117855721,"id":"zKkWk249","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117865939,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)21:38:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117855721\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117855721<\/a><br>No matter how many times you hear it, it will always be 100% true: Guns don&#039;t kill people.

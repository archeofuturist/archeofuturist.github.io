Fortunately it didn&#039;t cost me anything extra to see it.<br>Movie came out slow. First half hour felt like it was trying to justify it&#039;s existence as a Star Wars movie. Characters suck. Harrison Ford only good actor in the movie, looked like he needed a nap the whole time. Token black and token female leads at least didn&#039;t feel like they were presented as tokens.

Women are so programmed to buy shit and to socialize that they&#039;re losing sight of what&#039;s important; namely raising and educating children properly. Common core has risen very much from the notion that education is about socialization. About passing tests and not about understanding subject matter.<br>Women (white women) are wrecking the social construct. They&#039;re the ones to blame. They&#039;re the collateral range. I see more and more of them literally over socializing their kids with there peers and their mothers to the point that once the weekend rolls around the new 9-5 grind starts.

Need your help. <br><br>I made a thread on there about a 10 days ago that gave an error &quot;failed post&quot; or something to that effect. It happened twice, then I checked the catalog just in case and I seen it had created 2 threads. One had a few replies in it, so in the other one I posted &quot;please delete, duplicate thread due to forum error&quot; and a few hours later I got slapped with a 1-week ban for &quot;spamming the board&quot;.<br><br>After the ban ended a few days ago, I have successfully replied a few times since then, and just now I get this ban message with the same &#039;reason&#039; and with a permanent ban attached to the original ban. It was added a few days after and I got re-banned for the that original thread, again! Bullshit. No fucking explanation for this shit. <br><br>One of your mods are compromised. See the catalog threre. There&#039;s a thread titled &quot;We&#039;re smaller than \/v\/&quot; The first sentence says &quot;We are losing 400-500 unique IDs&quot;. <br><br>There is a rat. If anyone from your chan sees this, link them this topic in that thread, please. I need it to get seen there. <br><br>Also, pls bump for our other brothers.","filename":"Corruption","ext":".png","w":875,"h":822,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":234,"tim":1493790136751,"time":1493790136,"md5":"KGtQLDUh6AOr\/3mpGZjzLA==","fsize":46324,"resto":0,"id":"PktJidr+","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"8-pol-is-compromised-alet-alet","country_name":"United States","replies":7,"images":1,"unique_ips":7},{"no":123878430,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)01:46:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123878079\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123878079<\/a><br><br>Noone give a fuck about 8, you mong","time":1493790376,"resto":123878079,"id":"kdgQzMi5","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123878502,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)01:47:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"hehe poopies","time":1493790424,"resto":123878079,"id":"seGIQ0SP","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123878529,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)01:47:22","name":"Shadilay","com":"<a href=\"#p123878430\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123878430<\/a><br>8 is the brains behind 4, retard.","time":1493790442,"resto":123878079,"id":"PktJidr+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123878555,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)01:47:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"This place is compromised too, you sperg.","filename":"rmyt","ext":".png","w":1360,"h":1103,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":101,"tim":1493790459694,"time":1493790459,"md5":"G\/w6DNHbSg7Wvq4a\/i4RDA==","fsize":284177,"resto":123878079,"id":"Jb5a46dM","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123878685,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)01:49:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123878529\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123878529<\/a><br>Only fucking spergs like you believe that. 4chan has always acted on its own, I don&#039;t see how that&#039;s a hard concept for you faggots to understand.","time":1493790546,"resto":123878079,"id":"ikF6IDjV","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123878988,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)01:52:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123878529\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123878529<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;8 is the brains behind 4<\/span><br>Diminishingly so. 8pol used to be more than just natsocs.

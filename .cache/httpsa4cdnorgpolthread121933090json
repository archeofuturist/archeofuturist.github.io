Its just a cul de sac with like 15 houses, but the house across the street had someone jump their fence and try to open a window before someone seeing them, the neighbor on the other side of me had a full on break in and another house got robbed as well.<br><br>I am a veteran, I own a few guns and I live in Texas. I want some nigger or spic to try and break into my house, I would love the opportunity to blast some shitskins legally. Any way to bait them to try my house that isn&#039;t obvious? I doubt its legal to shoot at them if they are on someone elses property.","filename":"27a47-fallingdown_070pyxurz","ext":".jpg","w":1600,"h":1197,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1492652858439,"time":1492652858,"md5":"NjkUQKxZfC3K9lmHbY+oMA==","fsize":167029,"resto":0,"id":"m7hBd5fp","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"my-neighbor-told-me-that-there-has-been-multiple","country_name":"United States","replies":25,"images":0,"unique_ips":19},{"no":121933263,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)21:49:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121933090\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121933090<\/a><br>sit and wait","time":1492652946,"resto":121933090,"id":"liuRtJGM","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121933312,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)21:49:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121933090\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121933090<\/a><br>Surely posting this thread won&#039;t get you put in jail forever when they investigate the shooting.","time":1492652962,"resto":121933090,"id":"Q7cHLu4H","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121933509,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)21:50:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121933312\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121933312<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Let&#039;s check the 4chan politically incorrect board, surely there will be a vague post on there regarding someone legally shooting a burglar we can trace back to them and put them in prison for life!<\/span>","time":1492653047,"resto":121933090,"id":"t7+qmord","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121933554,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)21:51:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121933312\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121933312<\/a><br>They don&#039;t investigate a black man getting shot for breaking into a white man&#039;s house.","time":1492653066,"resto":121933090,"id":"pKaXSTL3","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121933689,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)21:52:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121933090\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121933090<\/a><br>Sounds like a heroin junkie looking for meds to steal.","time":1492653125,"resto":121933090,"id":"SvGvQmqk","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121934049,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)21:54:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121933689\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121933689<\/a><br>So you&#039;re saying I should leave some hint I work for a pharmaceutical company on my front lawn?

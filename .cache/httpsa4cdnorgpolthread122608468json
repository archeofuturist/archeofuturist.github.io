Bill is a well-known propagandist and currently the foremost advocate for the destruction of Western society and the dehumanization of your children. He knows what he is saying is wrong, remember, as leader of &quot;The Planetary Society&quot;, we can be sure he has looked at all the data. The truth about Bill is that he believes the sacrifice of millions of Western children is worth it because of whatever convoluted plan his backers and sources have told him will pan out down the road.<br><br>But he believes, this instant, that your children should be caught in the crossfire and destroyed for the greater good.<br><br>So what do we know about Bill and his people? His circle? His backers? And what can be done? The time has come, this type of propaganda must be rejected by the public and quite visibly.","filename":"1483932500054","ext":".png","w":259,"h":400,"tn_w":161,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493053567758,"time":1493053567,"md5":"kNL\/\/0ZHZyi8PIfYpVw7Fw==","fsize":205670,"resto":0,"id":"h+ur2Rkm","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-burial-of-bill-nye","country_name":"Canada","replies":18,"images":5,"unique_ips":13},{"no":122608659,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)13:07:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122608468\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122608468<\/a><br>If I remember he had a few controversies in the 90s.","time":1493053654,"resto":122608468,"id":"RJtulPlc","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122608867,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)13:09:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122608659\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122608659<\/a><br>At the very least, he needs to be Schumered.<br>Which is to say, openly rejected and mocked, his brand destroyed and his currency revoked.","filename":"1488347657586","ext":".jpg","w":682,"h":1024,"tn_w":83,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493053773182,"time":1493053773,"md5":"tlPGJRB+7IBZIXeqRG0pww==","fsize":76640,"resto":122608468,"id":"h+ur2Rkm","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122609533,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)13:15:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"This is going to blow up in his face big time.

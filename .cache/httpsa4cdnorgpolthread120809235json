Do not let them dictate the flow of conversation. Communicate with them on what you really want to do. It&#039;s best to research on what you want to do in whatever branch, and enter the recruiting office with that idea. Don&#039;t let them fill you with a false sense of urgency, don&#039;t them bribe you with a bonus. Sure that Navy Nuke job might have a huge bonus, but the attrition rate for Nuke school is very high. I&#039;ve even read on \/k\/, and heard from a few other prior service guys that some of those in Nuke school kill themselves or talk about suicide, so they fail. Don&#039;t ask &quot;can I, may I&quot;, if you want a job state that you WANT it. If they&#039;re being pushy with dates that you don&#039;t like, or if they&#039;re trying to ship you out sooner than what you wanted then you can always say no and come in at a later time. Remember, be assertive but don&#039;t be a complete dick. Just know what you want to do before coming in a recruiting office, as this will help you immensely. As stated before, study for the ASVAB and research on the career field that you want.

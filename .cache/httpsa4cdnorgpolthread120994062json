The SK side of the DMZ is a giant funnel, with a nice big surprise 300-style at the end. With the multiple camps there, our small force could hold them for days if not eliminated in the initial bombardment and if we didn&#039;t counterstrike almost immediatedly it would cripple the advance in a few hours, the magic number is 72 hours. 3 days. Any longer offensive before that and NK would lose NK&#039;s fingertip logistics, 3 weeks before arms length logistics were eliminated.","time":1492145150,"resto":120994062,"id":"sC8KqPk8","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121019792,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)00:47:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121019653\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121019653<\/a><br>The defenders didn&#039;t have artillery support and the defenders were also Arabs who suck cock at fighting.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Hurr hurr COIN is the same as conventional<\/span>","time":1492145223,"resto":120994062,"id":"eCivJvTi","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121019864,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)00:47:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120994062\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120994062<\/a><br>Do I get a qt SK refugee?","time":1492145272,"resto":120994062,"id":"DmXGexOR","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121019933,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)00:48:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121019180\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121019180<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;SEISMIC<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;TRACKING<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;VIA<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;WATERPIPES<\/span><br>It is not feasable for them to move anything by tunnel when we can bangor the top and collapse the tunnel upon them.","time":1492145309,"resto":120994062,"id":"sC8KqPk8","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121019969,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)00:48:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121019686\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121019686<\/a><br>All our equipment is sitting on depots very close to each other.

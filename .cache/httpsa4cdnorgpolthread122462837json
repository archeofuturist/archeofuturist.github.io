Who is this woman? A portrait in three stories.<br><br><br>Almost three stories are told about the AfD top candidate Kate Weidel in her party. One is about Weidel&#039;s private life. That she is living together with a woman at Lake Constance and is raising a common son there. In the public, the crude prejudice that Weidel, because of her homosexuality in matters of discrimination and emancipation, had to be a moderate AfD politician - although some high-ranking homosexual AfD politicians relativize both the peculiarity and the significance of Weidel&#039;s private life.<br><br>Is this the best poltical 4d-chess played in recent german politics?","filename":"alice-weidel-co","ext":".jpg","w":610,"h":344,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1492972534134,"time":1492972534,"md5":"kJNkocq954ocOGZySW6lvQ==","fsize":28768,"resto":0,"id":"Yt7NMKgG","country":"DE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"altright-lezzi","country_name":"Germany","replies":3,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":122463049,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)14:36:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122462837\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122462837<\/a><br>The second story also deals with superficialities. Weidel can make a world-wide impression. She is 38 years old, advises Internet companies around the world, has lived abroad for several years, also in China and speaks among other things Mandarin. Her appearance, the modern trousers, the smooth appearance of the business consultant, also made Weidel&#039;s reputation for being part of the drawer of the moderate functionaries. The fact that Weidel describes himself as an economic liberal makes the impression that the first part of the word can be left out, and that Weidel would be liberal in matters of social policy.","time":1492972615,"resto":122462837,"id":"Yt7NMKgG","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":122463113,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)14:37:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122463049\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122463049<\/a><br>The third story is about Bj\u00f6rn H\u00f6cke, the right-wing Thuringian president. The AfD chairwoman wants to exclude Frauke Petry from the party, which Weidel has advocated. In the polarization of the party party, this attitude became her destiny. A few weeks ago, when she ran for the state council of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, Weidel was already the elected top candidate of the national association for the Bundestag election.<br><br>Your choice should have been a self-running. Nevertheless, Weidel fell through the election of the board - which was understood as a punishment for their critical attitude towards H\u00f6cke in party trips.

Whoever is against hops, must therefore be particularly moderate, is the conclusion in the public at times.","time":1492972639,"resto":122462837,"id":"Yt7NMKgG","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":122464105,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)14:43:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"no bad analysis, but Weidel needs to be watched. The real heart of the AfD is H\u00f6cke and Gauland. But Gauland and Weidel as top candidates are a good choice! Will work out good...<br><br>But my guess is, at some point Weidel will try to make the same as Petry, and get ride of H\u00f6cke and Gauland. At this position she will be swipe left, like Petry. <br><br>But the real problem is Marcus Pretzell. He runs NRW and is also a liberal fag....

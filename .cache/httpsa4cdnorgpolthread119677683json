Rice was the point person for getting dirt on people through the NSA, and the White House used it illegally. <br><br>There was another article this morning, I&#039;d have to dig it up, that made some good points. The White House does no investigation. IF they saw a conversation between a US citizen and a foreign national, and wanted it unmasked, this would be done by the FBI. Susan Rice does not have the jurisdiction to investigate, and her requests are highly unusual in the context of how these requests were made. <br><br>Them thinking Hillary would win and none of this would surface?

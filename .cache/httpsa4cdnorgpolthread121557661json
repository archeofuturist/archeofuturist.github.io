As they say in the United States: &quot;to be different is to be indecent.&quot; The mass crushes beneath it everything that is different, everything that is excellent, individual, qualified and select. Anybody who is not like everybody, who does not think like everybody, runs the risk of being eliminated. And it is clear, of course, that this &quot;everybody&quot; is not &quot;everybody.&quot; &quot;Everybody&quot; was normally the complex unity of the mass and the divergent, specialised minorities. Nowadays, &quot;everybody&quot; is the mass alone. Here we have the formidable fact of our times, described without any concealment of the brutality of its features.","filename":"1492302587684","ext":".png","w":214,"h":198,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":115,"tim":1492453306529,"time":1492453306,"md5":"WrQZS4o8itznca1lhv9NaA==","fsize":1328,"resto":121557661,"id":"Fe\/2T5U4","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":121559942,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)14:29:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121557779\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121557779<\/a><br><br>Make love like a racist or expect rapist facists","time":1492453744,"resto":121557661,"id":"JmSt\/ivY","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121560376,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)14:32:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"THIS IS A GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY<br><br>WE MUST INCREASE THE MEMES FOR LE PEN!!!","filename":"1491891856324","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":480,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":100,"tim":1492453927802,"time":1492453927,"md5":"7K2FSzdEPjTSpbSDt\/BtWQ==","fsize":38857,"resto":121557661,"id":"idb3k0Ll","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":121560408,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)14:32:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121557779\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121557779<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Respect existence or expect resistance<\/span><br>WOah, try saying that five times fast","time":1492453939,"resto":121557661,"id":"Rnivs3WC","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121561131,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)14:37:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121557779\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121557779<\/a><br>The mastering behind that logo gave this man hope","filename":"1492420354762","ext":".jpg","w":670,"h":906,"tn_w":92,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492454262900,"time":1492454262,"md5":"TLF2kBQNvER\/8N+dNX64uA==","fsize":87344,"resto":121557661,"id":"MlfgScg+","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":121561272,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)14:38:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121557661\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121557661<\/a><br>how do you know Antifas did it?<br>how do you know that was not a false flag?<br>you have no proofs at all","time":1492454327,"resto":121557661,"id":"2flevgdB","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":121561576,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)14:40:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121558293\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121558293<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;and just like that, Le Pen wins.<\/span><br>This.","time":1492454451,"resto":121557661,"id":"RWqbzaCc","country":"MX","country_name":"Mexico"},{"no":121561888,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)14:43:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121557779\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121557779<\/a><br>Oh God do they really say this when they do the secret handshake?","filename":"1487628849982-pol","ext":".gif","w":320,"h":175,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":68,"tim":1492454592683,"time":1492454592,"md5":"48OG5\/+6gzoJq3433L2F2A==","fsize":2448288,"resto":121557661,"id":"FPwVNoP5","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

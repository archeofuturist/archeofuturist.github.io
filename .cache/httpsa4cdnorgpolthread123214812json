His sister gave a speech and told everybody to stop burning down their neighborhoods because they need their weaves, and to go burn down the white suburbs. CNN edited the footage and claimed she was calling for peace. This was spinning a narrative. Making news rather than reporting on it.<br><br>There are other, more subtle approaches. Remember all of the angst and outrage over KellyAnn Conway&#039;s feet on a couch in the Oval Office? She was taking a picture of Trump meeting with over 100 leaders of traditionally black colleges. But the media wanted to talk about her feet instead.

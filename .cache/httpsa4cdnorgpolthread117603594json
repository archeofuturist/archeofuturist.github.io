I mean there&#039;s a specific reason why these people were called snowflakes and cucks, they are so butthurt and desperate for these words not to be offensive anymore to use them every chance they get.

How upset are these people that we didn&#039;t take offense by being called deplorables? <br><br><br>long story short, wouldn&#039;t it be fun to call them a way i&#039;d force them to repeat over and over for the same reason?

I post when things are relevant, ignore slide threads because of how goddamn retarded they are, and all-in-all just try to keep things on topic.<br><br>But I can&#039;t help but notice a trend lately with how the Left and Democrats are acting in response to the Trump Administration giving credible proof to their claims. Let me lay it out or those of you who haven&#039;t been watching CNN and all the other fraudulent &quot;news&quot; outlets to see what sort of propaganda they&#039;re spewing. Because the way it&#039;s actually looking, it appears to be pretty grim.<br><br><br>As you are all aware, the Left\/Democrats have been pushing for their pathetic globalist agenda for some time, and only the most sane of us are willing to stand against it. However, as most of you have noticed, they&#039;re throwing everything they can to discredit President Trump now, from illegally wiretapping his communications, to outright forgery of documents.<br><br>The problem with this, however, is how the Left reacts to any sort of proof that President Trump and his cabinet give to the world at large in response to all these outlandish claims. They discredit any and all proof he gives, saying that he forged it, and that he&#039;s lying through his teeth. It&#039;s despicable, seeing as how they claim to hold the moral high-ground, but when they are shown proof to counter their claims, they try and throw it out the window as false information because &quot;it was from Donald Trump and his Administration, so it CAN&#039;T be real!&quot;<br><br>Additionally, why do you think they don&#039;t like Neil Gorsuch&#039;s take on the Constitution of the United States? Because he reads it as it is, not as it&#039;s interpreted in &quot;modern society&quot; as the media so elegantly puts it.<br><br>As it currently stands, we&#039;re at a point in the presidency where the Leftist scum and their Globalist overlords are willing to go to any extreme (bar assassination unless it&#039;s the last thing they can do) in order to reclaim the Oval Office. <br><br><br>Stay frosty, anons.","filename":"1481155461829","ext":".jpg","w":406,"h":364,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":224,"tim":1490365321261,"time":1490365321,"md5":"4ZtQMKGD46loWn9JJR0lxg==","fsize":38975,"resto":0,"id":"7kQ09ne4","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-left-has-lost-their-mind","country_name":"United States","replies":64,"images":7,"unique_ips":39},{"no":118085945,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)10:33:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"Now that you mention their fear\/distain of gorsuch, have you noticed much of the attacks against trump have come from the judicial branch, which is really upsetting.

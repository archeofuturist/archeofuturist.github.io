Socialism and communism fails unless it is implemented worldwide due to competition issues and not being able to trade with other capitalist nations, laissez-faire crony capitalism seen in Russia and the United States provides shit workers rights, low wages for the majority, low living standards, homelessness, shitty overpriced education and healthcare that fails to cover many people, whereas social democracy\/the Nordic system provides the highest living standards in the world, universal, quality healthcare and education, fantastic social benefits and programs that help the poor\/middle class thrive, strong and organized unions, etc..<br><br>Why don&#039;t more countries take up such a system? It is far more ethical and overall a better system than crony, garbage, unethical bootlicker-style capitalism where all of the wealth generated goes straight to the people at the top, whilst they contribute nothing to their society other than overpriced, low quality goods due to poor regulation and low standards for corporations to abide by. The goods manufactured in Europe; and especially the more social democratic countries; are of significantly higher quality than say, something produced in America. This is because when workers are treated with respect and paid fairly, and when the boss and management are closely tied with the workers themselves, they happen to foster higher quality workplaces, and thus, more love goes into the products and\/or services the workers produce.<br><br>Until worldwide socialism becomes a viable and realistic alternative, I can&#039;t understand why people haven&#039;t caught on that laissez-faire, crony, corrupt capitalism already exists in the U.S. and in Russia. Or why they haven&#039;t caught on to the fact that it produces blatantly shit results when compared to Scandinavia\/North and West EU.","filename":"4621530+_b3c56a76f219210285b7576313f1baa6","ext":".jpg","w":300,"h":169,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1493523961717,"time":1493523961,"md5":"zBOPP57vnnbJusGwIFqs1g==","fsize":17142,"resto":0,"id":"LFpwy9UE","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"so-how-is-the-nordic-system-not-being-universally","country_name":"United States","replies":11,"images":1,"unique_ips":9},{"no":123431683,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)23:50:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"I just noticed Japan put our ships in one of their Anime series.","filename":"Heavy Object","ext":".png","w":1654,"h":598,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":45,"tim":1493524224743,"time":1493524224,"md5":"jQ8pmtg6Xnqs+YyfrU6W7g==","fsize":1858925,"resto":123431223,"id":"abJNBDXo","country":"SE","m_img":1,"country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":123432451,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)23:57:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123431223\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123431223<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Socialism and communism fails unless it is implemented worldwide<\/span><br>it would fail even harder if you had to share your shit with 5.6 billion poor people","time":1493524672,"resto":123431223,"id":"pMu\/HV0u","country":"BE","country_name":"Belgium"},{"no":123433094,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)00:04:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"Socialism is garbage.

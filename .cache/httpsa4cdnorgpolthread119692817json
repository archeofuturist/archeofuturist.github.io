One of the reasons a central european might cite for being pro europe is that they fear cultural domination from the austrians\/germans\/serbs\/croats more than they do from cultureless Brussels. Flemish and Catalans may also erroneously or not see the EU as an opportunity to have greater relative standing within the EU than they do within Belgium and Spain, nation states whose status would be eroded. Similarly the scots. So it is in some cases exactly because of national identity that they are pro EU. That said perhaps this is cross-purposes there is nation as in nation-state and nation as in &#039;volk&#039; which may not have a corresponding nation state.","time":1491482416,"resto":119692817,"id":"S8OJEVNa","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119738488,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)08:40:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119738339\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119738339<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;

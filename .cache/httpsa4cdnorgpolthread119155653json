The failing newspapers and weak journalists... more specifically the WSJ and Buzzfeed are seeking out it&#039;s demise.<br>Youtube is one of the biggest platforms combating the monopoly of the MSM and I don&#039;t want to see it die.. or even slightly diminish.<br><br>What can we do to combat this? Memetics? Autistic hackz? It might be time to resurface our Meme Magick and launch the war against the MSM. <br><br>Emperor Trump has been fighting this fight for a while now and I think it might be time we fully engage.

Their plan is fairly straightforwards, use their media assets to damage competing advertising platforms then exploit the damage to sell their own. By their own I don&#039;t mean a youtube competitor, they want to utterly destroy anything with user created content and shift advertisements to mainstream media websites.<br><br>They have made some mistakes however. They are counting on people being preoccupied defending youtube and others while they push their own advertising platforms. They assume people will rage against the WSJ and others while being unaware of their new platforms.<br><br>Their platform is relatively immature, it would not survive widespread public outrage and everyone examining them for the smallest screwup to use against them. The key to their plan is a wholly newscorp owned platform named unruly.co and to a lesser extent a partnership with a company called AppNexis.<br><br>If the youtube rage were directed against those two the result would be significant. I don&#039;t really know how to spread this to prominent youtube people. If pewdiepie or h3h3 were to inform their viewers of the unruly.co plan the result would be predictable. The problem is for the most part they see the WSJ or other newscorp entities as separate groups. Letting one entity take all the hate while another enacts their plan is usual practice.","filename":"1490368900073","ext":".png","w":434,"h":434,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":124,"tim":1491040305610,"time":1491040305,"md5":"L8FkqLv\/Slhbum+7qVEQLw==","fsize":144966,"resto":119155653,"id":"VWeBT2s4","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":119166429,"now":"04\/01\/17(Sat)06:13:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119155653\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119155653<\/a><br>I fully expect ANY media source to show some kind of bias,be this left or right, and YouTube is no exception.

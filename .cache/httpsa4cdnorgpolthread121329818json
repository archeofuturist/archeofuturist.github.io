Our education system is systematiclaly designed to favor women, and StanDev is everything in IQ studies. Women are statiscially much less likely to make high end discoveries, but are on average much better suited to educating and caring for children. The very nature of the Standard distribution of IQs for women (and the evolutionary explanation for that) are why women are best suited for family focus. It is not a demotion, it is having all parts of society function in the area they are most capable for.","time":1492325468,"resto":121329818,"id":"HlGOdfgw","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121330618,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)02:54:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121329818\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121329818<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;women take drivers education training at the same rate as men<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;still cant fucking drive<\/span>","time":1492325654,"resto":121329818,"id":"k3GPniY1","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121330886,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)02:57:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121330336\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121330336<\/a><br>Not to mention these studies are always done on kids\/teenagers, where women mature quicker than men.

You&#039;d surprised how starving 3rd world countries often have useless shit like high speed Internet access. Soon (((Zuckerberg))) will bring Facebook everywhere so that niggers will be able to watch Pepsi ads while they die off thirst. This is globalism at its finest.","filename":"smuganime","ext":".jpg","w":736,"h":592,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":100,"tim":1492373777563,"time":1492373777,"md5":"M29UVB1\/g5h9oC9zcPZJAg==","fsize":40816,"resto":121396453,"id":"t\/0LaH7D","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":121407286,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)16:17:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121406969\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121406969<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;TFW MAGA actually meant &quot;Make America an Empire&quot; since the beggining.<\/span><br><br>The time fo the Republic is over lads.","time":1492373849,"resto":121396453,"id":"D7yfMQck","country":"BE","country_name":"Belgium"},{"no":121407445,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)16:18:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121405900\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121405900<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;transforming Somalia from an ancap paradise to a corporate hellhole<\/span>","time":1492373921,"resto":121396453,"id":"wI8cvNl1","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121407647,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)16:20:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"how many?","time":1492374006,"resto":121396453,"id":"rnbrrJGt","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":121407769,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)16:20:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121404947\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121404947<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121402906\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121402906<\/a><br>Fuck off Shills<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Stabilize Somalia<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Stops the flow of refugees<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Elimenate their &quot;we have no where else to go argument&quot;<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Somalis can actually go back now<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;If he was a neoocon he&#039;d be trying to destabilize as many countries as possible to send cheap labor refugees to the west.<\/span>","time":1492374058,"resto":121396453,"id":"FS4sV\/1S","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121407828,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)16:21:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121407769\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121407769<\/a>","filename":"a4b42c3fb12aa8fccc00451345ec02e3","ext":".jpg","w":736,"h":684,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":116,"tim":1492374079239,"time":1492374079,"md5":"FxbwR59Svd9pwyVWpO0k1w==","fsize":83650,"resto":121396453,"id":"aQDNXpvW","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121407834,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)16:21:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121406572\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121406572<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121406969\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121406969<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121407286\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121407286<\/a><br>https:\/\/www.rt.com\/viral\/377775-mak<wbr>e-somalia-great-again-us\/","time":1492374083,"resto":121396453,"id":"qFE1UeL3","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121408108,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)16:23:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121396453\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121396453<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;dozens of soldiers<\/span><br>it&#039;s literally dozens","time":1492374201,"resto":121396453,"id":"rnbrrJGt","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":121409454,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)16:33:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121402793\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121402793<\/a><br><br>This <br><br>Hope Mexico and Latin America is next","time":1492374788,"resto":121396453,"id":"RZBh+Cg\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121409745,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)16:35:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121396453\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121396453<\/a><br>America First people, America First.<br>America First, right after Israel, Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Somalia...<br><br>gj electing a meme","time":1492374928,"resto":121396453,"id":"lOVmE8SD","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":121409764,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)16:35:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"Oh wow!

Not liking immigrants ins&#039;t irrational because they lower the wages of workers and bring their shitty culture into our country. Not liking Islam is not irrational because a majority of terrorist attacks are perpetrated in the name of islam and because it also brings with it shitty barbaric practices. Not liking homosexuals isn&#039;t irrational because homosexuals spread Venereal diseases, are disproportionately pedophillic, threaten the family, and subvert our culture by trying to normalize the inherent nihilism of homosexuality. Hating trannys is not irrational because they agigitate for the disregard of science when it suits their feelings, they ask to be recognized as female by the state, (which is objectively false, we would ridicule someone who said they wanted identify as a 55 year old when they are objectively 15 for example) and want special protection to live out their perverted fantasy.<br><br>Why have we allowed these subversive scum to co-opt our language to feed into their stupid bullshit?","filename":"txzkIRr5","ext":".jpg","w":432,"h":432,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491000209219,"time":1491000209,"md5":"K6FbseWqbvu3Kb4M2vTRhA==","fsize":32796,"resto":0,"id":"dPnmTQ62","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-hijacking-of-the-english-language","country_name":"United States","replies":15,"images":3,"unique_ips":14},{"no":119110893,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)18:51:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119110087\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119110087<\/a><br><br>beat them at their game","filename":"verbal_arsenal","ext":".png","w":1770,"h":787,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":55,"tim":1491000689715,"time":1491000689,"md5":"yj2gYTjUwMzY0Lt3A\/I0kA==","fsize":72071,"resto":119110087,"id":"rFro1nlI","country":"GR","country_name":"Greece"},{"no":119110910,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)18:51:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119110087\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119110087<\/a><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=wUJ<wbr>efiibHL4&amp;","time":1491000698,"resto":119110087,"id":"zs6T6TRQ","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119111048,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)18:52:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119110893\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119110893<\/a><br>I&#039;d add European Nationalist for those smug lefties.<br>Seeing as Nationalist=Racist in their eyes.","time":1491000779,"resto":119110087,"id":"nJFByEWV","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119111546,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)18:57:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"just political weapons bro, created by ((them)) for control.","filename":"1479698126082","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":504,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":98,"tim":1491001049849,"time":1491001049,"md5":"swRN6hgScjFbc2Tom2smZg==","fsize":21430,"resto":119110087,"id":"kkjHfgAC","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119111659,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)18:58:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119110893\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119110893<\/a><br>these are great","time":1491001118,"resto":119110087,"id":"dPnmTQ62","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119112827,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)19:09:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119110087\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119110087<\/a><br>But what is rational?","time":1491001792,"resto":119110087,"id":"Fpb6W2q+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119112947,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)19:11:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"Everyone ever everywhere has called disagreement madness or &quot;mental illness&quot;.

I was doing some video editing and I needed a graphic of a &quot;Do Not Enter&quot; type sign. Long story short, I came across a &quot;No Go Zone&quot; sign and looked it up.<br><br>Holy fucking shit - why doesn&#039;t the news talk about this? For those who don&#039;t know (like me an hour or so ago) a &quot;No Go Zone&quot; is an area of a country (mostly Europe) where it is so dangerous because of Muslim or minority occupation that not even the police will enter. It usually has a parallel legal system (Sharia Law, etc) and the government won&#039;t do anything about it. <br><br>Do government ignore these zones because they want to seem inclusive and liberal? So they don&#039;t look like &quot;bigots&quot; or &quot;Islamophobes&quot; or whatever? Is that really what the fuck is going on?<br><br>That&#039;s scary as shit.","filename":"shariahzone3","ext":".gif","w":283,"h":400,"tn_w":176,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491885824284,"time":1491885824,"md5":"eMhsOVyH17\/UvimZueqK7w==","fsize":84184,"resto":0,"id":"kUJqFddV","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"no-go-zones","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":1,"unique_ips":1},{"no":120554453,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)00:44:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"In fact, they are, like, officially marked?

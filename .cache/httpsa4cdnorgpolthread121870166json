Then one branch of the Orthodox Croats decided fuck all and created their own bullshit sect called the Bogomilovsky Religion of Palacinka and considered themselves as Bosses, in fact their early donations to the holy Bogomil church actually came from BOSS\u2122. In honour of this ecnomoic dona- er.. transaction, they chose to call themselves BOSSnians and made a white flag with some fucking shield on it because it was the fashion during that time. Aaaaanyway, what is important too understand is that the Ottoman Empire wwere the only ones who could keep these animals in check and even then they still couldn&#039;t unite against a common foe no matter how muslim he is.<br><br>After the ottoman occupation the Orthodox Croats and Catholic Serbs couldn&#039;t tell eachother apart and neither could anyone else (not that they actually gave a flying fuck) so they decided to change religions to Catholic Croat and Orthodox Serb because everyone was changing their fucking religion at the time (especially the BOSSnians and ALbanians, lmao) so they thought, why the fuck not?<br><br>Then they were forced into a multicultural EU-project by king Tito-nkhamun and his Egyptian slave army. This union lasted untill approx 1990 when it was fashion for communism regimes to die. It ended in a bloody war between the Yugo-slavs who fought over if the Yugo (car) was Serbian or Croat.<br><br>So as you can see my dear friend, it is complex history of two peoples and their noble proud history and identity.<br><br>Oh.

Concentration camps for Serbs and shit, almost like a holocaust, as a revenge for oppressing croats in first Yugoslavia which was done as revenge for atrocities done by Croats in ww1<br><br>4) second Yugoslavia (1945 - 1991) - Serbs despised Croats for siding with Germans in ww2 and kinda oppressed us again, people were not allowed to call themselves Croats, police in Croatia was mostly composed of Serbs (they didnt trust us). All that as a revenge for ww2<br><br>5) War of independence 1991 - 1995 - Croats wanted independent state after 50 years of Serb dominated second Yugoslavia, and Serbs didnt plan on allowing that to happen. Many war crimes, ethnic cleansing of Croats etc<br><br>6) 1995 - Final chapter in sorrowful 20th century Cro - Serb saga. Ethnic cleansing of 300k Serbs which was done as a revenge for previous 4 years of war which was caused by Serb oppression of Croats in 2nd yugoslavia which was caused by Croat war crimes in ww2 which were caused by Serb oppression of Croats in first Yugoslavia which was caused by croats invading Serbia as part of A-H army.<br><br>tl;dr it started in 1914 and ended in 1995.

There has been a new negative record of births: 474,000 compared to 486,000 for 2015, which had already fallen to historic lows. There were 608,000 deaths in 2016. In one year, Italy lost 134,000 people -- the equivalent of a city of the size of Ferrara or Salerno.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;A year ago, European geographers went in search of &quot;the most desolate place in Europe&quot;. They discovered it not in northern and cold Lapland, but in sunny Spain, specifically in the area of Molina de Aragon, two hours from Madrid. Depopulation has not been the consequence of the climate, as in the Russian steppe or northern forests, but of a demographic crisis.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Spain loses 72 inhabitants every day; 20% fewer children are born there than two decades ago. Demographers draw a line where Spain has no future and 30% of the population will be over the age of 65. In some Spanish regions, the fertility rate barely reaches one child per woman. Deaths already exceed births. Spain, in 2050, will be a depopulated nation dominated by older people and singles. The country will lose 5.3 million inhabitants: 11% of the current population. By that time, there will be 1.7 million Spanish children fewer than there are today.<\/span><br><br>The Islamic world has launched a demographic challenge to a sterile Europe. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan recently exhorted Muslims in Europe to have five children, &quot;because you are the future of Europe&quot;. It echoes what the President of Algeria, Houari Boumedienne, said in 1974: &quot;The wombs of our women will give us victory&quot;. They dream of conquering Europe through demography instead of terror -- and it seems they are succeeding.<br><br>Are we done for?<br><br>https:\/\/www.gatestoneinstitute.org\/<wbr>10133\/europe-disappearing","filename":"RIP","ext":".jpg","w":596,"h":341,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":143,"tim":1491298439417,"time":1491298439,"md5":"WBh8eZ0mOvjLO3N+nchQ6A==","fsize":95790,"resto":0,"id":"cv\/i54QR","country":"ES","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"is-europe-choosing-to-disappear","country_name":"Spain","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":119452598,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)05:37:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119452388\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119452388<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Spain, in 2050, will be a depopulated nation dominated by older people and singles.

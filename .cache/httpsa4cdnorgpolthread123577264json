So I have some questions that I would like to ask.<br><br>1.Since &quot;Ancapistan&quot; is 100% free &quot;country&quot; where you can do what ever you want as long as it doesn&#039;t violate the nap, what stops people from forming small city states if everyone consents? People like stability and we are naturally drawn to creating tribes\/kingdoms\/empires.<br><br>2.how will you deal with ideology drift? people over generations change their views. And without authoritarian power you have no way of keeping people ancaps by its very definition.<br><br>3. If a state was to form in this land of the free&quot;ancapistan&quot;, how will others defend themselves if such a state turns aggressive? I know the whole security contractors and recreational nukes situation, but an organized state almost always trumps those who are loosely tied. especially if they are authoritarian.","filename":"ancap_flying3_no_logo","ext":".png","w":800,"h":800,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493612529148,"time":1493612529,"md5":"DZ\/XH88teqji01gmgii14Q==","fsize":743109,"resto":0,"id":"RpSngRMU","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"questions-for-ancaps","country_name":"Canada","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

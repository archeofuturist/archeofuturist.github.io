I&#039;ve been in Toronto working for a few months and I&#039;ve observed that<br>1) Indians really are as filthy as they say<br>2) The lower income Blacks really are as stereotypical prone to violence as they say. There are a fair number of hard working blacks in the construction sector though. <br>3) The Asians are the most based in Toronto. The whites here are totally degenerate and constantly coming up with more outrageous styles and lifestyles. <br>4) Any based whites in Toronto must drive cars and not use the subway system like I decided to try out for fun since I&#039;ve always driven.","time":1491915927,"resto":120585874,"id":"+9MGl43M","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120595282,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)09:06:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120595091\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120595091<\/a><br>Anon...

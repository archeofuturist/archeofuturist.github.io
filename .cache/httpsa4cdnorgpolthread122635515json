The title of the film \u2013 taken from The Matrix, in which Keanu Reeves is offered the choice of a red pill (which delivers lacerating truth and self knowledge) or a blue pill (blissful ignorance) \u2013 is portentous. Viewers are invited to infer that revelations \u2013 perhaps shocking ones \u2013 will almost certainly be forthcoming. Protests! Cancellation of screenings! This must be some heavy stuff. I paid my $6.95 to rent the title, and sat back, prepared for outrage.<\/span><br>http:\/\/www.baka.com.au\/comment\/the-<wbr>red-pill-ban-an-absurdity-only-onli<wbr>ne-activism-could-create-20170421-g<wbr>vpd1l.html","filename":"1473986347001","ext":".jpg","w":960,"h":613,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":159,"tim":1493066901713,"time":1493066901,"md5":"Q32wIFyRkeR0H\/tZauHPHA==","fsize":269262,"resto":0,"id":"i4X0+FdS","country":"IL","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"annabel-crabb-the-red-pill-movie-ban-is-an","country_name":"Israel","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

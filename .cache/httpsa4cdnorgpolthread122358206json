So they eventually will need to trade, and that will set a price, say 3 units of corn per tobacco. Eventually as you add more people to this system you start noticing a pattern: it&#039;s hard to find others to trade stuff with because not everyone wants corn or tobacco or whatever they&#039;re producing.

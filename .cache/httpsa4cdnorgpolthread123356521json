Ignore this moron. <br><br><br>Addict here. Yes it&#039;s a disease, I never asked for this. I&#039;ve been clean 4 years now. The reasons I started were legitimate pain and my addiction was through a doctor. With that said, the first time I took a painkiller it completed me, there was always some sort of dopamine deficiency, I didn&#039;t realize it until I took one. I think you know where it went from there. I never stole, I never did anything to hurt anybody, when I ran out I got sick till I could fill my next script. <br><br>4 years later? It&#039;s the first thought when I wake up, it&#039;s what I dream about. It never leaves you. Depends how you define disease, but it&#039;s not about willpower. This is something in the flight and flight category, it&#039;s a primitive lizard brain impulse, you can&#039;t &quot;will it away&quot;, that&#039;s not how biology works. That would be like willing away the desire to breath oxygen. <br><br>Is it something youre born with? Yes and no. You are born very predisposed to addiction, but anything can trigger it. Once triggered you live with it for life, and it&#039;s a daily struggle. <br><br>Disregard any people who haven&#039;t experienced it first hand, they don&#039;t know. Again, my only sin was being born in pain and trying to stop that pain. For some they take it and it relieves their pain and they move on. For me it was like a deep love, it&#039;s hard to explain, when you stop it feels like losing a child.","time":1493488546,"resto":123356521,"id":"FIr49SSf","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123359432,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)13:59:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123358966\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123358966<\/a><br>Addict here, its a disease, its a dopamine deficiancy, i get addicted to several things, pot, junk food, fapping, that need will always be there no matter the drug used to correct it, i switched to clean eating and regular strenuous excercise, my body is now addicted to the high you get after a workout","time":1493488792,"resto":123356521,"id":"cNUBOFTa","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123359719,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)14:02:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123356521\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123356521<\/a><br>There&#039;s no such thing as willpower or anything, free will is a myth, there&#039;s just an environment interacting with genes, some people are heavily predisposed to drug use and can&#039;t actually help it, so for them you could say it&#039;s a disease, but for some other people they just use them because they either want to or don&#039;t want to go through the pain of quitting, even though they could, so for them it&#039;s not a disease.","time":1493488939,"resto":123356521,"id":"9x\/jpKyG","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123359784,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)14:02:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123356521\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123356521<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;just an excuse for people incapable of taking responsibility for their actions<\/span><br><br>Ignorance isn&#039;t less ignorant just because it has a veneer of masculinity and grit.

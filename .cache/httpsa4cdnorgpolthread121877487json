Scientists and people who care about science are an intersectional group, embodying a diverse range of races, sexual orientations, gender identities, abilities, religions, ages, socioeconomic and immigration statuses.

We recognize that, historically and today, some scientific endeavors have been used to harm and oppress marginalized communities. Political actions -- such as gag orders for government science agencies, funding freezes, immigration bans, and policy changes blocking action on climate change -- lead to greater damage for vulnerable populations. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;We commit to educating ourselves and others about the issues of inclusion, diversity, equity, and accessibility in science.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;We pledge to amplify the work of underrepresented scientists and to address concerns and critiques as we work together to make scientific spaces more equitable.<\/span>","filename":"1492535214082","ext":".png","w":477,"h":421,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":110,"tim":1492628961272,"time":1492628961,"md5":"CLx7pfxJoUoafR8DLlnFfw==","fsize":50145,"resto":121877487,"id":"v1SupS+k","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121881220,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)15:10:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121877810\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121877810<\/a><br>What are you protesting in Canada?","time":1492629024,"resto":121877487,"id":"IF5MMY9Z","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121881672,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)15:13:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121881078\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121881078<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;shoehorning politics into STEM<\/span>","filename":"1439617263095","ext":".gif","w":455,"h":560,"tn_w":101,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492629234861,"time":1492629234,"md5":"tgyz8yPfJa7HYiAz470hSA==","fsize":98222,"resto":121877487,"id":"1gdTJagz","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121882527,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)15:20:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"Bumping for science","time":1492629627,"resto":121877487,"id":"npX4VI0W","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121883085,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)15:24:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121877487\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121877487<\/a><br>I fear theres going to be a bunch of people spouting shit they know nothing about just because they &quot;like stars&quot; i.e. every &quot;protest&quot; thats been happening, that being said I do hope that its actually full of intelligent people and speakers. just hope those fucking retards that think theyre smart keep their mouths shut","time":1492629896,"resto":121877487,"id":"djOf9h0x","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121883731,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)15:29:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121880001\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121880001<\/a><br>A march to basically raise an awareness of science, in the sense of we need to fund more scientific things and stop defunding science related things. not anything to do with antifa, however those fucks will hijack anything sort of like a protest to make it into something its not. lets just hope it stays a march for science (awareness)","time":1492630199,"resto":121877487,"id":"djOf9h0x","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121883798,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)15:30:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"bunch of fucking normies that want to seem smart and &quot;sciency&quot; but probably failed statistics for humanityfags","time":1492630226,"resto":121877487,"id":"omIffFyW","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121884819,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)15:38:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121877487\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121877487<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Diversity in Africa is tied to political infighting and is a major barrier to development:<\/span><br>Easterly, William, and Ross Levine. &quot;Africa&#039;s growth tragedy: policies and ethnic divisions.&quot; The Quarterly Journal of Economics (1997): 1203-1250.<br><br>Posner, Daniel N. &quot;The political salience of cultural difference: Why Chewas and Tumbukas are allies in Zambia and adversaries in Malawi.&quot; American Political Science Review 98.04 (2004): 529-545.<br><br>Habyarimana, James, et al. &quot;Why does ethnic diversity undermine public goods provision?.&quot; American Political Science Review 101.04 (2007): 709-725.<br><br>Eifert, Benn, Edward Miguel, and Daniel N.

And we were treated like movie stars with muscle. We had it all, just for the asking. Our wives, mothers, kids, everybody rode along. I had paper bags filled with jewelry stashed in the kitchen. I had a sugar bowl full of coke next to the bed. Anything I wanted was a phone call away. Free cars. The keys to a dozen hideout flats all over the city. I\u2019d bet twenty, thirty grand over a weekend and then I\u2019d either blow the winnings in a week or go to the sharks to pay back the bookies. Didn\u2019t matter. It didn\u2019t mean anything. When I was broke I would go out and rob some more. We ran everything. We paid off cops. We paid off lawyers. We paid off judges. Everybody had their hands out. Everything was for the taking. And now it\u2019s all over. And that\u2019s the hardest part. Today, everything is different. There\u2019s no action. I have to wait around like everyone else. Can\u2019t even get decent food. Right after I got here I ordered some spaghetti with marinara sauce and I got egg noodles and ketchup. I\u2019m an average nobody. I get to live the rest of my life like a schnook.","filename":"1490923064463","ext":".png","w":469,"h":840,"tn_w":139,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490923604626,"time":1490923604,"md5":"uKX3Oorri\/n8mixQGu6OUw==","fsize":343575,"resto":0,"id":"YvkKpZfD","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"see-the-hardest-thing-for-me-was-leaving-the-life","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

Or maybe you don&#039;t even fill in the captcha. Maybe you&#039;re such a disgusting NEET that you actually paid for a 4chan pass, so you just choose the picture. Oh, and we all know the picture.

I imagine you little shit laughing so hard as you click it that you drop your Doritos on the floor, but it&#039;s ok, your mother will clean it up in the morning. Oh, that&#039;s right. Did I fail to mention? You live with your mother. You are a fat fucking fuckup, she&#039;s probably so sick of you already. So sick of having to do everything for you all goddamn day, every day, for a grown man who spends all his time on 4chan posting about a capeshit movie. Just imagine this. She had you, and then she thought you were gonna be a scientist or an astronaut or something grand, and then you became a NEET. A pathetic Banefag NEET. She probably cries herself to sleep everyday thinking about how bad it is and how she wishes she could just disappear. She can&#039;t even try to talk with you because all you say is &quot;FOR YOU FOR YOU FOR YOU.&quot; You&#039;ve become a parody of your own self. And that&#039;s all you are.

The real world, by contrast, above their mothers\u2019 basements, was a place they did not succeed, perhaps a place they did not fundamentally understand.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Soon 4chan and other like minded-men who felt wronged by women took up the rallying cry. The effort somehow moved from lurid interest in a particular woman\u2019s sex life to a critique of video games. &quot;<br><br>&quot;here we can understand this group as people who have failed at the real world and have checked out of it and into the fantasy worlds of internet forums and video games. These are men without jobs, without prospects, and by extension (so they declaimed) without girlfriends. Their only recourse, the only place they feel effective, is the safe, perfectly cultivated worlds of the games they enter. By consequence of their defeat, the distant, abstract concept of women in the flesh makes them feel humiliated and rejected. Yet, in the one space they feel they can escape the realities of this, the world of the video game, here (to them, it seems) women want to assert their presence and power.&quot;<br><br>&quot;4chan users pretended a furious amount of mouse clicking and virtual action would somehow translate into a concrete reward appearing in their computer screens, like it does, say, in World of Warcraft.&quot;","time":1490732591,"resto":118690002,"id":"xL6fU0A4","country":"IN","country_name":"India"},{"no":118691858,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)16:27:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"&quot; Pepe symbolizes embracing your loserdom, owning it. That is to say, it is what all the millions of forum-goers of 4chan met to commune about. It is, in other words, a value system, one reveling in deplorableness and being pridefully dispossessed. It is a culture of hopelessness, of knowing \u201cthe system is rigged\u201d. But instead of fight the response is flight, knowing you\u2019re trapped in your circumstances is cause to celebrate. For these young men, voting Trump is not a solution, but a new spiteful prank.&quot;<br><br>&quot;4chan\u2019s value system, like Trump\u2019s ideology, is obsessed with masculine competition (and the subsequent humiliation when the competition is lost). Note the terms 4chan invented, now so popular among grade schoolers everywhere: \u201cfail\u201d and \u201cwin\u201d, \u201calpha\u201d males and \u201cbeta cucks\u201d. This system is defined by its childlike innocence, that is to say, the inventor\u2019s inexperience with any sort of \u201cIRL\u201d romantic interaction. And like Trump, since these men wear their insecurities on their sleeve, they fling these insults in wild rabid bursts at everyone else.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Trump the loser, the outsider, the hot mess, the pathetic joke, embodies this duality. Trump represents both the alpha and the beta. He is a successful person who, as the left often notes, is also the exact opposite\u2014a grotesque loser, sensitive and prideful about his outsider status, ready at the drop of a hat to go on the attack, self-obsessed, selfish, abrogating, unquestioning of his own mansplaining and spreading, so insecure he must assault women. In other words, to paraphrase Truman Capote, he is someone with his nose pressed so hard up against the glass he looks ridiculous. And for this reason, (because he knows he is substanceless) he must constantly re-affirm his own ego. Or as Errol Morris put it, quoting Borges, he is a \u201clabyrinth with no center\u201d&quot;","time":1490732830,"resto":118690002,"id":"xL6fU0A4","country":"IN","country_name":"India"},{"no":118692044,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)16:28:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118690002\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118690002<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Climate change is likely the result of human beings acting as a catalyst<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Make everything go to hell even faster when the world follows the example of the USA<\/span><br><br>This is sad.<br>I&#039;m never voting republican, ever.","time":1490732932,"resto":118690002,"id":"dPTJ+Txe","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118692143,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)16:29:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118690002\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118690002<\/a><br>Good american goyim, you will be abel to breathe in more toxic gases so we can keep making profits.","time":1490732976,"resto":118690002,"id":"1pCKkBdx","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":118692396,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)16:31:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118690628\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118690628<\/a><br>Yeah let&#039;s keep all that regulation so companies will move to china or india where there are no enviromental regulations at all.

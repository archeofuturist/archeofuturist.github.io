The majority of NK people would still be alive, and they&#039;re extremely poor. Integrating NK back into a greater Korea would be too expensive for SK&#039;s government to pull off without substantial foreign aid and their average quality of life would take a massive hit.<br>As the other poster said, China would probably try to take the resource-rich sections of NK while leaving the North Koreans themselves to become a Western problem. Assuming they got their way, SK would gain a bit of mostly-useless land and millions of destitute, unskilled citizens they have nothing in common with other than race.<br>It&#039;s better to leave the Kim dynasty in power, assuming you can get them to end their nuclear program.","time":1493368749,"resto":123169791,"id":"ogoUzLrC","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123170811,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)04:42:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123170523\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123170523<\/a><br>i wouldn&#039;t mind trading some syrian refugees for some qt nk gf refugees. <br>definitely just ransack that country though and leave the remains to all the surrounding countries. the us has and should have no interest in the land there.. pretty small and insignificant.","time":1493368959,"resto":123169791,"id":"4ubxWvgF","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123171203,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)04:47:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123170523\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123170523<\/a><br>Wouldn&#039;t it be easier to install a puppet government?

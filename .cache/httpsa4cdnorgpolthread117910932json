See basically, the Quran uses some fairly simple, but also very powerful psychological tools to make sure it spreads and can&#039;t be easily removed. Apostasy is punishable by death, and is one of the greatest offenses you could do, even moreso than just being an infidel. Being a &#039;bad muslim&#039; is deserving of roughly the same treatment, but not only that, anyone who is a bad muslim is probably actually a false muslim, and is only jealous of you and wishes you dead from the bottom of their heart. <br><br>So essentially, you can never leave the religion, and the religion tells you that you should be on the lookout constantly for all those fake muslims who secretly will try and kill you, and that if you think someone is one, you should kill them first. This is why there&#039;s all those honor killings and shit. Say you daughter is a slut, but really, you don&#039;t want to stone her or throw acid at her or whatever. Well too fucking bad, if you don&#039;t kill her publicly and her slutness gets out all your neighbors will suspect you of being complicit and just kill you and your whole family. And they&#039;re obligated to do that lest their neighbors suspect them of being fake muslims for letting you live and kill their whole family, and so on and so forth as high up as you&#039;re willing to go.","time":1490263951,"resto":117910932,"id":"pxnKsxPx","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117915509,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)06:13:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"Taqiyya.","time":1490264017,"resto":117910932,"id":"XBiMn85X","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":117915542,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)06:14:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117913402\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117913402<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I&#039;ve never read it<\/span><br><br>It&#039;s extremely short and it repeats itself many times over. <br><br>Also what <a href=\"#p117912986\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117912986<\/a> didn&#039;t mention is that there exists supplemental material called Hadith which are essentially &quot;things Mohammad probably said&quot; and are used to justify all sorts of bullshit.","time":1490264044,"resto":117910932,"id":"B5uWf\/XN","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117915563,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)06:14:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117912243\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117912243<\/a><br>Damn, I&#039;m struggling to not laugh in my lecture.","time":1490264062,"resto":117910932,"id":"ccOP4ngK","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":117915582,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)06:14:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117915177\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117915177<\/a><br>I think that&#039;s one of the sectarian splits, with some thinking the Hadith and Sunna are okay and some wanting only the Quran.","time":1490264079,"resto":117910932,"id":"pxnKsxPx","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117915969,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)06:19:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"[x] aloof expression<br>[x] black and vaguely east-asian looking<br>[x] ridiculous headwear<br>[x] obnoxious glasses<br>[x] dumb earrings<br>[x] choker<br>looks like we have ourselves a munafiq","time":1490264371,"resto":117910932,"id":"AyaayAXX","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":117916120,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)06:21:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"Weird thing is she is an engineer and still bothers with faith.

So technically, Muslims can&#039;t tax each other. So this historically leaves 2 sources of income for the government, raiding and non-muslims. So Mohammed early on said that there is no compulsion in religion, and morons wanting to say Islam is peaceful and tolerate will repeat that crock of shit all day. In practice, Mohammed, the perfect man who did everything right, just walked up and said &#039;You either convert, die, or keep your religion but pay me a crippling sum of money&#039;<br><br>Now, the Jizya tax had to make up the entire taxbase, so it was ludicrous. Adding onto that, you could technically keep your religion, but you could never build a religious building, you cannot worship in public ever, and you cannot wear or present iconography of your faith in public ever. What happens if you need to move to a bigger church or your&#039;s burns down for totally unexplainable reasons? Too bad, you can&#039;t build a new one. And you&#039;re being crushed under taxes.

And then you have to raise your kids as legitimate muslims and they won&#039;t be pretending even if you were because if you let them know you were pretending they might let something slip and you all die.

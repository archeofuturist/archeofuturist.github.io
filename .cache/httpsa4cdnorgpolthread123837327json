For some of us, his promises weren&#039;t enough, but face it, if those people were promised what they wanted by Trump, he wouldn&#039;t have made it to presidency. There&#039;s a law of acceleration, where you can only go so fast in a direction without falling apart. Momentum is swinging leftward, and what Trump did is spin that around. That&#039;s fucking great. Does that mean by 2024 everyone will be duck walking, Soros would be dead, and Hillary would be kept in a brain jar subject to mental tortures ad nauseum? No. <br><br>Normies, in this moment, are not going to be cool with &quot;unpopular&quot; casual racism (even though it&#039;s being built up against white people; your point of view is not the fucking point). Normies, in this moment, are not going to be cool with ethnocentrism. They&#039;re not going to be cool with all the things you want to have because they&#039;ve been conditioned to hate those things. To do these things they hate will make them hate you. However, that&#039;s just how they are now. People change when they see they&#039;ve been wrong on some things. The goal is to find these extents of their patience and test them. That&#039;s what Trump did.<br><br>This game isn&#039;t over, so stop shooting for endgame goals. Shoot for milestones. They&#039;re a lot like you, yes, they&#039;ve just been taught to hate you, and being exactly what they hate isn&#039;t doing anyone favors.","filename":"1478852529311","ext":".gif","w":400,"h":400,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493767758984,"time":1493767758,"md5":"QuxZeP8vuEOrPmkQbD79cg==","fsize":3582184,"resto":0,"id":"AVIPfnpw","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"a-friendly-reminder-for-politically-active","country_name":"United States","replies":45,"images":9,"unique_ips":27},{"no":123837430,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)19:30:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123837327\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123837327<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;t. the_donald<\/span>","filename":"fffuckingBASED","ext":".png","w":1146,"h":643,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1493767814730,"time":1493767814,"md5":"C+gYlriWALKTNej9w8FZrA==","fsize":1319568,"resto":123837327,"id":"\/MMVDJhF","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":123837668,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)19:32:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123837327\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123837327<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;absolutely haram<\/span>","filename":"1490667850117","ext":".jpg","w":1020,"h":575,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1493767937929,"time":1493767937,"md5":"CI5rouDGxnvcpkZubuKaHQ==","fsize":106462,"resto":123837327,"id":"QNR8DH6a","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123837912,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)19:34:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123837430\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123837430<\/a><br>Get the t_d cucks what they want because it&#039;s closer to what you want than losing.

I would have figured this is common knowledge, especially in politics. The reason a vast majority of politicians are despised is because of their flip-flopping and self-moderation, it makes them appear as if they aren&#039;t sincere about their beliefs (which they usually are not).<br><br>I understand the angle you&#039;re coming from but part of what I have seen people despise in politics is the endless bullshit coming from politicians. You use moderating issues as a way of garnering support, but if your issues need moderating to make them more &#039;palatable&#039; the reality is that you&#039;re likely putting them across in a very poor manner. You&#039;re correct in assuming that using the same strategies as previously used will not work part in parcel due to the large amount of brainwashing occurring at the educational level, this only advocates for new strategies, not compromising on values. That only leads to the sort of &quot;watering down&quot; that has become evident in areas like t_d, who then migrate here expecting the same, and accuse others of being shills when they&#039;re hit with reality.","time":1493773215,"resto":123837327,"id":"utuZJ84y","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"},{"no":123848219,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)21:01:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123843409\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123843409<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;they&#039;re fucking tourists<\/span><br>All these advertisers and marketers need to neck yourself.

For some of us, his promises weren&#039;t enough, but face it, if those people were promised what they wanted by Trump, he wouldn&#039;t have made it to presidency. There&#039;s a law of acceleration, where you can only go so fast in a direction without falling apart. Momentum is swinging leftward, and what Trump did is spin that around. That&#039;s fucking great. Does that mean by 2024 everyone will be duck walking, Soros would be dead, and Hillary would be kept in a brain jar subject to mental tortures ad nauseum? No. <br><br>Normies, in this moment, are not going to be cool with &quot;unpopular&quot; casual racism (even though it&#039;s being built up against white people; your point of view is not the fucking point). Normies, in this moment, are not going to be cool with ethnocentrism. They&#039;re not going to be cool with all the things you want to have because they&#039;ve been conditioned to hate those things. To do these things they hate will make them hate you. However, that&#039;s just how they are now. People change when they see they&#039;ve been wrong on some things. The goal is to find these extents of their patience and test them. That&#039;s what Trump did.<br><br>This game isn&#039;t over, so stop shooting for endgame goals. Shoot for milestones. They&#039;re a lot like you, yes, they&#039;ve just been taught to hate you, and being exactly what they hate isn&#039;t doing anyone favors.","filename":"1478852529311","ext":".gif","w":400,"h":400,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493767758984,"time":1493767758,"md5":"QuxZeP8vuEOrPmkQbD79cg==","fsize":3582184,"resto":0,"id":"AVIPfnpw","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"a-friendly-reminder-for-politically-active","country_name":"United States","replies":13,"images":2,"unique_ips":11},{"no":123837430,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)19:30:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123837327\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123837327<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;t. the_donald<\/span>","filename":"fffuckingBASED","ext":".png","w":1146,"h":643,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1493767814730,"time":1493767814,"md5":"C+gYlriWALKTNej9w8FZrA==","fsize":1319568,"resto":123837327,"id":"\/MMVDJhF","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":123837668,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)19:32:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123837327\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123837327<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;absolutely haram<\/span>","filename":"1490667850117","ext":".jpg","w":1020,"h":575,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1493767937929,"time":1493767937,"md5":"CI5rouDGxnvcpkZubuKaHQ==","fsize":106462,"resto":123837327,"id":"QNR8DH6a","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123837912,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)19:34:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123837430\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123837430<\/a><br>Get the t_d cucks what they want because it&#039;s closer to what you want than losing.

It&#039;s a fake word. Think of this mantra initiated by CIA lemon party gestapo on americans after CIA pervertariat attacked and destroyed USA on 9\/11. Remember how balanced carnival on TV shitbags used to constantly chant like some hare krishna worshipers: &quot;support our troops&quot;. And americans did &quot;support&quot; those foreign troops coming to holocaust them. Very devious games are being played. It leads to some sort of swastika worshiping brahmin caste in tibet.","time":1492510390,"resto":121663945,"id":"WStlJ\/hF","country":"LT","country_name":"Lithuania"}]}

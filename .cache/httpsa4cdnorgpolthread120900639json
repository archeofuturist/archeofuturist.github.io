Sorry for the incoming blog post.<br><br>First of all, I am someone who wants to return to the faith that has been absent for quite some time. I went through the &#039;euphoric&#039; stage in high school and declared myself an atheist. This was mostly because I began getting interested in the physical sciences which caused me to find a lot of ebbin meme athesits on youtube. I was an atheist from pretty much 16-22 and convinced of it.<br><br>However, something changed in my life that I don&#039;t have to go into that started to bring me back to the faith. I am 25 now and I desperately want to return to the Church in full, but I really don&#039;t know how. I only ever went to confession at my high school, so I don&#039;t know how to do it in real life. I would really appreciate help with how to progress returning to the Church.<br><br>Second, I started dating a girl that I really like who is also Catholic. My question is how I should tell her that I am returning to the Church and that I was an atheist for a long time. I also slept with 4 different women during this time, which I am ashamed of and feel I should tell her this as well. How should I go about telling her these things?<br><br>Sorry for the long read, but I&#039;m looking for help.","time":1492084924,"resto":120900639,"id":"tGchnvcl","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120902340,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)08:05:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"I was raised catholic but now I&#039;m not really practicing.

For many, it&#039;s the most offputting, yet it&#039;s the most important. Check your local parish for confession times. You could contact the priest and request immediate confession (he has to say &#039;yes&#039;) but I understand if you&#039;d rather do it anonymously.<br><br>Have you been baptised, had holy commuion &amp; been confirmed? This&#039;d help me advise you on returning to the faith.<br><br>On the chick issue: I don&#039;t think telling her you were an atheist should be an issue. She&#039;s probably undergone doubts too, &amp; willnot be surprised you weren&#039;t always devout. On the sleeping with other girls issue, I&#039;d probably not mention that in the same conversaion, &amp; maybe leave that until it comes up organically","time":1492085647,"resto":120900639,"id":"lMD\/zjok","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"}]}

He proceeds to come closer in an awkward side-step-triple-threat pose that soon becomes some kind of gallop. He gets to me and stops. Looks at me, caulks his head to the side, and then winds up with the sword with no intentions of slowing down his swing, so I had to dodge it and started running. I was really high and panicking, so I thought the best thing to do would be to hop on a small bicycle (I was 19 at the time) and try my best to escape. <br>So Im hauling ass down one of the main aisles, when I notice that my girlfriend is no where to be found. So I start head back to where we were to look for her, where I find the masked stranger cornering her. My instincts took over, and ended giving this dude a swift kick to the left temple, which made him fall like a sac of potatoes.<br>After much questioning, turns out the dude was SEVERELY autistic and had ran away from his caretaker while they were at a nearby K-Mart. He just wanted to play. Never felt worse in my life.","time":1493276219,"resto":122997812,"id":"RjR+fdfi","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123007806,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)03:02:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123007406\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123007406<\/a><br>Is this real?","time":1493276537,"resto":122997812,"id":"VKVdWB5y","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":123007948,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)03:04:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"\/ourgal\/","filename":"Shakira_635x400","ext":".jpg","w":603,"h":380,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":78,"tim":1493276661527,"time":1493276661,"md5":"oyhE6eIAEIFZ0m\/glRNgOg==","fsize":38709,"resto":122997812,"id":"PB+UL1OA","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123007956,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)03:04:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123007806\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123007806<\/a><br>A real pasta, yes.","time":1493276667,"resto":122997812,"id":"HyP4+pxO","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123008713,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)03:15:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123002041\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123002041<\/a><br>BLUE BRADFORD<br>BLUE BIRMINGHAM<br>BLUE EAST LONDON","time":1493277309,"resto":122997812,"id":"LbtKH0PL","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123009279,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)03:23:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"BASED MAY KILLING OFF THE MUSLIMS<br>https:\/\/twitter.com\/AbdiwaliUK\/stat<wbr>us\/854278326759960577","filename":"gas the muzzies","ext":".png","w":615,"h":252,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":51,"tim":1493277782842,"time":1493277782,"md5":"lkpvFAZYQYho75QRLD6Ezw==","fsize":44382,"resto":122997812,"id":"LbtKH0PL","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123009689,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)03:28:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123009279\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123009279<\/a>","filename":"IMG_1767","ext":".jpg","w":306,"h":423,"tn_w":90,"tn_h":124,"tim":1493278119291,"time":1493278119,"md5":"GqknPq7QryJKXA4WSihqYw==","fsize":36456,"resto":122997812,"id":"HyP4+pxO","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123009786,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)03:30:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123002041\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123002041<\/a><br><a href=\"#p123003583\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123003583<\/a><br><a href=\"#p123008713\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123008713<\/a><br><br>It&#039;s a nice idea but realistically the only muzzies that aren&#039;t going to vote because of this wouldn&#039;t vote anyway because they think democracy is haram.","time":1493278205,"resto":122997812,"id":"qzU3HFfG","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123009868,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)03:31:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"Anyone got any FACKIN THREE DAYS WURF memes?","filename":"1493238242563","ext":".png","w":579,"h":287,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":61,"tim":1493278275847,"time":1493278275,"md5":"He1VUw\/IK8UugTPVnOurGA==","fsize":149749,"resto":122997812,"id":"qzU3HFfG","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123010249,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)03:36:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123009786\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123009786<\/a><br>There&#039;s some really marginal seats in London with pakis <br>Tooting is has got tons of them and is 5.

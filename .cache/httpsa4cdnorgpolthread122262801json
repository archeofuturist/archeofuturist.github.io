For example, I&#039;ve seen a lot of signs that are extremely partisan in nature. Trying to associate science as a practice or approach with one political party is a losing battle, and inherently is false-j although this current circus really highlights the disconnect with the political establishment and subject matter experts, the problem. Is hardly unique to this adminstration. For example, the GMO labeling scheme debate has existed for some time and with the advent of crispr, really came to a fever pitch during Obama&#039;s second term. This crisis was resonating then, at least in my field, when it was rumored the EPA might adopt some seriously flawed policies regarding classification of what it crops qualify as &quot;transgenic&quot;. So it&#039;s problematic to reduce this to a &quot;trump problem&quot; and while it alienates many people from the message, it also reduces the scope of the problem this march weeks to highlight.<\/span>","filename":"reddit and memey","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":576,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1492882399148,"time":1492882399,"md5":"wSwrRTmbCzIYohgoKfXZJQ==","fsize":158315,"resto":122262801,"id":"yYJgF7TZ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122302406,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)13:33:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122302027\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122302027<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;crying for more gibsmedat from the tax payer<\/span><br>I hate science<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;t.scientist<\/span>","time":1492882423,"resto":122262801,"id":"4gqNYtpF","country":"AT","country_name":"Austria"},{"no":122302642,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)13:35:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122302347\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122302347<\/a><br>I stopped trying to keep up with this shit.

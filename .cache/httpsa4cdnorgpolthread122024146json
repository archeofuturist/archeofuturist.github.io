What the fingers of these poor wretches have penned or are penning the world will -- perhaps unfortunately -- forget, as it has forgotten so much else. But the gigantic works of the Third Reich are a token of its cultural renascence and shall one day belong to the inalienable cultural heritage of the Western world, just as the great cultural achievements of this world in the past belong to us today.","filename":"adolfwojak","ext":".png","w":200,"h":200,"tn_w":200,"tn_h":200,"tim":1492713153062,"time":1492713153,"md5":"Eiq9aOhV1ch1h8JFY2vz0A==","fsize":11736,"resto":0,"id":"OloUNvAs","country":"DE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"what-would-he-think-of-todays-germany","country_name":"Germany","replies":4,"images":1,"unique_ips":4},{"no":122024577,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)14:36:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=nIJ<wbr>pOw78HMM","time":1492713390,"resto":122024146,"id":"2xRWnN3S","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122025441,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)14:44:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"Finally a german flag on \/pol\/ saying something positive about Hitler for once. Quite honestly thought I am not gonna see it these days anymore on \/pol\/. <br><br>Completely agree with you, OP. Hitler deeply cared for the german people, and quite frankly, he even cared for the Europe as a whole. He would have saved my little country from this nasty bolshevist disease and I could live in utopia right now.","filename":"maxresdefault1","ext":".jpg","w":621,"h":900,"tn_w":86,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492713871983,"time":1492713871,"md5":"ARZ8KQ771b+AS+K7KyOKVg==","fsize":110877,"resto":122024146,"id":"aG2srIFC","country":"EE","country_name":"Estonia"},{"no":122026276,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)14:52:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122024146\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122024146<\/a><br>I have no doubt he knew what was comming.

Lots of things can induce addictive behavior such as video games and the internet. It is a highly complex question you should ask a psychologist.<br><br>If you ask about alcohol adddiction or drug addictions it is not up to the government to decide what someone puts into his body and what not.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Since a person&#039;s income will almost entirely determine their standard of living, is the relationship between the employer and the employee still voluntary?<\/span><br><br>Yes it is still voluntary. Welfare by the government isn&#039;t an excuse. In fact it makes the worker or employee way more valuable to the employer because he can&#039;t just outright abuse him like crazy cause that will end up costing him employees, attract the worst employees or simply put him on the edge of going out of business.<br><br>We aren&#039;t in the early 19th century anymore where factory workers can abuse local workers that have no means of escaping. It does not work like that in a globalist economy thats ultra mobile.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;How would an ancap society handle climate change, pandemics, and other catastrophic events that can be caused by human negligence?<\/span><br><br>The same it does now. Right now humanitarian agencies, non profit orgs usually pull the biggest loads under these circumstances. Why would a society be interested in letting a natural disaster occur and have long lasting effects on its own economy? Makes no sense no way you want to put it.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;How will artistic value be preserved without patents, copyright, and anti-piracy laws?<\/span><br><br>Define &quot;artistic value&quot;. The chinese economy is almost patent free - thats how it puts out all these fakes of fakes of fakes for super low prices today which is a good thing. Theres a good documentary on Wired about Shenzen.

In a free market however every move by a corporation can get punished heavily cause its left with no protection from the state and its army. See Samsung and South Korea.

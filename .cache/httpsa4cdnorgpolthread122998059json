Lots of things can induce addictive behavior such as video games and the internet. It is a highly complex question you should ask a psychologist.<br><br>If you ask about alcohol adddiction or drug addictions it is not up to the government to decide what someone puts into his body and what not.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Since a person&#039;s income will almost entirely determine their standard of living, is the relationship between the employer and the employee still voluntary?<\/span><br><br>Yes it is still voluntary. Welfare by the government isn&#039;t an excuse. In fact it makes the worker or employee way more valuable to the employer because he can&#039;t just outright abuse him like crazy cause that will end up costing him employees, attract the worst employees or simply put him on the edge of going out of business.<br><br>We aren&#039;t in the early 19th century anymore where factory workers can abuse local workers that have no means of escaping. It does not work like that in a globalist economy thats ultra mobile.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;How would an ancap society handle climate change, pandemics, and other catastrophic events that can be caused by human negligence?<\/span><br><br>The same it does now. Right now humanitarian agencies, non profit orgs usually pull the biggest loads under these circumstances. Why would a society be interested in letting a natural disaster occur and have long lasting effects on its own economy? Makes no sense no way you want to put it.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;How will artistic value be preserved without patents, copyright, and anti-piracy laws?<\/span><br><br>Define &quot;artistic value&quot;. The chinese economy is almost patent free - thats how it puts out all these fakes of fakes of fakes for super low prices today which is a good thing. Theres a good documentary on Wired about Shenzen.

It&#039;s not about protecting what you created, rather protecting yourself from getting sued for retarded shit all made up and by design.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;When automation makes the vast majority of low and mid skill labor obsolete, how would an ancap society function with most people left without an income?<\/span><br>Social Darwinism, worst case scenario riots and war breaks out but these people will die out either way.<br><br>Rest of your questions besides the manmade disasters one are stupid and ill let someone else handle that one.","time":1493270037,"resto":122998059,"id":"s4ZbbNUG","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122998990,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)01:15:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122998059\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122998059<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;When automation makes the vast majority of low and mid skill labor obsolete, how would an ancap society function with most people left without an income?<\/span><br><br>Technology historically makes new jobs available we can&#039;t even think of right now. The service economy and people who work with their &quot;minds&quot; in an office create jobs people would have never thought will ever exist as little as 30 years ago.<br><br>You can only fall for this meme when you heavily believe in marxists underconsumptionism. Which is complete non sense.<br><br>If nobody has a job - who is going to buy a product? Producers and Owners have an interest in having people that can actually afford and buy their products.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Would corporate culture resemble anything like it is now in America and Europe?<\/span><br><br>statism is corporate culture since corporates lobby the government and abuse it for their own gain and there is nothing the individual can do about it. In a free market however every move by a corporation can get punished heavily cause its left with no protection from the state and its army. See Samsung and South Korea. Samsung literally owns South Korea and its government and drains the country.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;Since there is no dead weight loss and productive incentives with a Georgist tax system, would it be an acceptable system for the benefit of a citizen&#039;s dividend and effective land management?<\/span><br><br>Georgism is dishonest. Its market capitalism and just a big fat meme. Anything else you tell yourself is nothing but a delusion on your part. Just be honest i mean cmon. You can&#039;t have it all at once and pretend it&#039;ll work somehow.","time":1493270108,"resto":122998059,"id":"C1W5z3p8","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":122999732,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)01:23:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122998059\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122998059<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;If someone is addicted to a product, is it a voluntary exchange?<\/span><br>Free will is still a thing.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;Since a person&#039;s income will almost entirely determine their standard of living, is the relationship between the employer and the employee still voluntary?<\/span><br>Come up with a better product and become the boss.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;How would an ancap society handle climate change, pandemics, and other catastrophic events that can be caused by human negligence?<\/span><br>Loaded question.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;How will artistic value be preserved without patents, copyright, and anti-piracy laws?<\/span><br>Good question<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;When automation makes the vast majority of low and mid skill labor obsolete, how would an ancap society function with most people left without an income?<\/span><br>Income is a representation of the value of product produced.

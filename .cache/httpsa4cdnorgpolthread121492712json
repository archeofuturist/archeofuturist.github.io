If you have been actively working towards something most of your life, you will always become something greater than average. If you have been a dedicated degenerate and underachiever your whole life, you will not suddenly become great, unless you win the jackpot at lottery.<br><br>Read the biographies of famous people, such as Steve Jobs. Since he was a kid he was being very enterprising and building himself up towards something that was his own thing, he was not shitposting on a siberian fish-catching hieroglyphs conmemoration about how he feels depressed about being an underachieving faggot.","filename":"1491721423799","ext":".jpg","w":705,"h":960,"tn_w":91,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492411864078,"time":1492411864,"md5":"N1AN0yx4HUhk+N0N+C4xjQ==","fsize":90828,"resto":121492712,"id":"2k5xHu6o","country":"EE","country_name":"Estonia"},{"no":121493371,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)02:51:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121492712\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121492712<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; imaginary friends<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;as long as im surrounded by decent people<\/span><br><br><a href=\"#p121493167\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121493167<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;claims others are blue pilled<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;believes in fairy tales<\/span><br> Delusion is strong in this thread","time":1492411905,"resto":121492712,"id":"1soTqcwe","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121493888,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)02:56:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121493297\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121493297<\/a><br>yeah. but im not steve jobs. im not smart. im not athletic. some people aren&#039;t. i almost have my degree, and then i&#039;ll be making enough to provide not just for myself but for a possible future family<br><br>im not Micheal Jordan. im not Eisenstein. im not president trump. im not ghandi, or hitler. right now im another shitposting anon on 4chan realizing that &quot;greatness&quot; like everything else is relative.<br><br>if i follow your mindset ill never be happy. you really want me to compare myself to steve fucking jobs? ill never be happy then. is that how you live? always comparing yourself to insanely successful people? youll never find happiness<br><br>i graduate in a month and a half. then i can peruse my career and maybe eventually settle down on some comfy plot of land. im just human, you&#039;re just human. im accepting the reality","time":1492412191,"resto":121492712,"id":"8gvLTeQc","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121495059,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)03:08:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121493888\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121493888<\/a><br>Re-evaluate your life. You are probably a millenial, and managed to get into college and almost have your degree in the greatest country on the face of the earth. You probably have a set of skills that the society finds useful, and you will land a job that will allow you to find a woman and sustain a family. Is there not greatness in that, knowing that you can sustain the bloodline your forefathers have spilled blood for to keep alive, that you can have children with the woman of your choice and you can live on eternally in the form of our children and your grandchildren? <br><br>Help me understand because I am confused. What do you mean by greatness? Because getting your 15 minutes of fame on tabloids like Ryan Gosling or Katy Perry is not &quot;greatness&quot;. These people will grow old one day and realize what they were doing is not what goes down in history. Now if you mean people who go down in history such as Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Nikola Tesla, Elon Musk, then you have to understand that if you set this to be your goal, you can still aim for greatness if you take little steps every day. <br><br>For example, did you know that J.K. Rowling worked as a janitor in her middle age and become famous only after having been written Harry Potter at the age of 40? She was not famous or even remotely remarkable before that. I know she is a libshit but it&#039;s a good example that you can achieve big things if you REALLY believe in your abilities and have confidence in your ambitions.","filename":"1487138678720","ext":".png","w":700,"h":502,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":89,"tim":1492412912554,"time":1492412912,"md5":"+v0bMbQS4KwM5fJ\/AABlbQ==","fsize":721268,"resto":121492712,"id":"2k5xHu6o","country":"EE","country_name":"Estonia"},{"no":121495195,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)03:10:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121492712\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121492712<\/a><br>dank blog post faggot","time":1492413009,"resto":121492712,"id":"mw5I9sG2","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121495217,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)03:10:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"do heroin","time":1492413032,"resto":121492712,"id":"j3IvF3La","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121495295,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)03:11:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121492712\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121492712<\/a><br>So you have grown up.

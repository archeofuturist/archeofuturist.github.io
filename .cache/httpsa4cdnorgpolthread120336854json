As a whole, women choose more jobs with monopsony labor market (as in multiple sellers, only one buyer), meaning wages for teachers aren&#039;t likely to rise as fast as engineers. However, if more women choose to study something less lucrative such as social work over finance, I don&#039;t really see this as an inequality issue, different demographics have different preferences and trying to change that without further arguments is merely statistical fetishism in my opinion. The only legitimate complaint comes from the working hours, because if daycare is too expensive one parent has to remain at home and women are more likely to do that, meaning less income for them on the aggregate level.","time":1491774502,"resto":120336854,"id":"k\/zcSRlB","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":120343461,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)17:53:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120342133\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120342133<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;implying you couldnt just get the nerds in the class to help you<\/span>","time":1491774794,"resto":120336854,"id":"hbvqVm17","country":"SG","country_name":"Singapore"},{"no":120343797,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)17:55:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120342806\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120342806<\/a><br><br>*To elaborate the monopsony argument, if there are multiple employers they have to compete with each other over the most productive employees.

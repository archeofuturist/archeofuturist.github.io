It\u2019s become far too easy to ignore workers and, partly because of this, workers feel increasingly helpless and impotent. The concerted attack on unions by neoliberal interest groups, together with the shift from a Fordist to a post-Fordist organisation of the economy \u2013 the move towards casualisation, just-in-time production, globalization \u2013 has eroded the power base of unions [and thus the labor force].<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;the idea of anti-capitalism no longer acts as the antithesis to capitalism. Instead, it is deployed as a means for reinforcing capitalism. This is done through media such as WALL-E which aims at providing a safe means of consuming anti-capitalism without actually challenging the system. The lack of coherent alternatives, as presented through the lens of capitalist realism, leads many anti-capitalist movements to not target the end of capitalism, but instead to mitigate its worst effects, often through individual consumption-based activities such as Product Red<\/span>","time":1490987434,"resto":119086985,"id":"PbmNBX61","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119087891,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)15:10:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"What an absolute earthquake of a week lads.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;team from different department cocked up a project spectacularly<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;basically burned through half of a 4 year project achieving jack shit<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;major damage control reverberating throughout company starting last week<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;even the CEO getting involved personally, long heated meetings, failed team leader getting grilled<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;head of my department (boss of my boss) says that he can save the project on the condition the new team leader will be line managed by him and the project transferred to his department<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;everyone agrees to this<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;learn details on Tuesday morning as the head of department calls me to his office<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;offers me the job of leading the project (12 people under me, \u00a3500k budget)<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;sign the contract today<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;starting at my new position on Monday<\/span><br><br>wew\/10<br><br>Salary went from \u00a344,800 to \u00a359,400 too.","time":1490987434,"resto":119086985,"id":"rLILU7uv","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119087898,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)15:10:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119087628\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119087628<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;YKTD still posts but without his trip<\/span><br><br>Really?

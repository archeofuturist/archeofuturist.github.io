DIES AFTER CHOKING AT PANCAKE-EATING CONTEST<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;HARTFORD, Conn. -- A college student whose father was killed in the Sept. 11 attacks has died after choking during a pancake-eating contest.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Police said 20-year-old Caitlin Nelson died at a New York City hospital on Sunday, three days after participating in the contest at Sacred Heart University. She was from Clark, New Jersey, and was a junior majoring in social work at the Roman Catholic school in Fairfield.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;It&#039;s a tragic event that started out as something fun,&quot; said Fairfield police Lt. Bob Kalamaras.&quot;It was just a tragic accident.&quot;<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;When Nelson started choking at the contest, two nursing students who were there immediately began lifesaving measures and were quickly joined by police officers and paramedics, Kalamaras said. She was taken to a hospital in Bridgeport in critical but stable condition and transferred on Friday to New York-Presbyterian\/Columbia University Medical Center.<\/span><br><br>http:\/\/6abc.com\/news\/college-studen<wbr>t-from-nj-dies-after-pancake-eating<wbr>-contest\/1831931\/","filename":"11751871_10204619052171988_7970869290496388778_n","ext":".jpg","w":960,"h":960,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491268901313,"time":1491268901,"md5":"swEOYNRkt5BSPNZnUJQyIw==","fsize":39169,"resto":0,"id":"YkoQ6P22","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"ban-assault-pancakes","country_name":"United States","replies":23,"images":3,"unique_ips":23},{"no":119411040,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)21:25:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119410585\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119410585<\/a><br>Guess she was a swallower.","time":1491269143,"resto":119410585,"id":"vHbbOu5m","country":"A1","country_name":"Unknown"},{"no":119411171,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)21:26:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"God dam she should be choking on a dick instead.","time":1491269207,"resto":119410585,"id":"5KTCN5HV","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119411343,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)21:28:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119411040\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119411040<\/a><br><a href=\"#p119411040\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119411040<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;chokes<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;guess she swallows hurrr<\/span><br>clearly she can swallow faggot she died.","time":1491269285,"resto":119410585,"id":"klpY3V51","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119411392,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)21:28:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119410585\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119410585<\/a><br>I&#039;d still fuck her","time":1491269309,"resto":119410585,"id":"oximgQJ+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119411730,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)21:31:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119410585\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119410585<\/a><br>She was gorgeous <br><br>Good girl too<br><br>Rip beautiful","time":1491269473,"resto":119410585,"id":"bMTG\/IDe","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119412669,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)21:39:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"How do you die 3 days later from choking and in a hospital?","time":1491269965,"resto":119410585,"id":"w49pwHvh","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119412852,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)21:41:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119412669\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119412669<\/a><br>This.

That includes native americans who white people decided were indians cuz they fuckin felt like it. Bro you don&#039;t have to have anything to do with me though that&#039;s fine, but you do have to deal with that brother you see in the mirror everyday. I have been shitted on by black folks too I don&#039;t live in a false reality, but I also recall that whenever black folks do try to stick together white people always find a way to keep us wedged apart. Hell at one point in America it was illegal for blacks to unify. Just remember them white folks you hang around will never accept you, you will never truly be one of them.","time":1490366570,"resto":118071994,"id":"ei3Rvk29","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118086886,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)10:43:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118071994\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118071994<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;people on the right:<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;haveguns<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;have big trucks and real american cars<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;run over cyclists<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;have liquor stores<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;have strip\/poker clubs<\/span><br>sounds pretty dope<br>the left side couldnt look faggier even if you shooped homos going at it on every square inch","time":1490366604,"resto":118071994,"id":"acZRsPLs","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":118086933,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)10:43:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118076461\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118076461<\/a><br>I&#039;m pretty sure the liberal laws of Portland still affect the red parts of Oregon, so you essentially have a bunch of Republicans getting to enjoy Democratic laws.

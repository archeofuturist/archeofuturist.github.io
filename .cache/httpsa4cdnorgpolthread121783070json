This included clove cigarettes, which aren&#039;t always flavored. Some of them just have cloves in them. The clove cigarette was supposedly invented as a remedy for the inventor&#039;s breathing problems and lung pain. Probably not good medicine, but it stands that the cloves themselves are not habit forming and don&#039;t cause cancer. At their best, clove cigarettes are only 60% tobacco, making them slightly less dangerous, and too harsh for most people to chain smoke.

Grew up in the 60&#039;s and 70&#039;s. <br><br>Smoking was everywhere. Our bus driver for school smoked on the bus. There were ashtrays everywhere - at school, at the doctors office, in department stores. The onlu place I remember where you couldn&#039;t smoke was the floor at movie theaters that had balconies - you smoked in the balcony. The checkout at the store was a wall of cigarettes. Johnny Carson smoked on his show. It was common to see smoking on TV and in movies. The store my mom bought smokes at knew us, so they&#039;d sell them to us, we&#039;d run in while mom waited in the car - a pack was $.52 cents. A lot of people still smoked unfiltered, and a lot of people smoked and chewed cigars, and pipes. We were surrounded by cigarettes. Most houses had cigarette holders on the dining room table or in the living room. I flew on planes when they still allowed smoking on planes. Trains, too. I got burned when a dude hit me with his cigarette in the NYC subway, when we went to go visit family. <br><br>Other than that, it was more polite back then. People in general had manners. Trash was a problem, though, that&#039;s when the commercials with the crying indian started. Pollution was at it&#039;s worst in the 70&#039;s. I remember going up to the top of the Empire State Building in the early 70&#039;s and the air was brown. <br><br>Mall culture started in the 70&#039;s. Before that, it was all local stores, or big box stores like Pennys or Sears - and it was a big deal to go. We had a local grocery, local butcher, local bakery, etc. <br><br>But, it was safe. Everyone knew everyone for blocks. Your kids could trick or treat after dark safely. We never saw black kids until I was 13, we only knew them from TV. Kids were respectful, or they got hit. Spanking still happened in school - my elementary school was terrified of the principal, because he used a wooden paddle. I got spanked once in the 4th grade - and got it again when I got home.","time":1492575420,"resto":121783070,"id":"1gYgA3bC","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121799928,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)00:17:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121799604\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121799604<\/a><br>Basically.

This included clove cigarettes, which aren&#039;t always flavored. Some of them just have cloves in them. The clove cigarette was supposedly invented as a remedy for the inventor&#039;s breathing problems and lung pain. Probably not good medicine, but it stands that the cloves themselves are not habit forming and don&#039;t cause cancer. At their best, clove cigarettes are only 60% tobacco, making them slightly less dangerous, and too harsh for most people to chain smoke. When they were finally outlawed I found it easy to quit smoking.<br><br>Meanwhile, an exception was made for menthol cigarettes, which are every bit as deadly as ordinary cigarettes and every bit as addictive.

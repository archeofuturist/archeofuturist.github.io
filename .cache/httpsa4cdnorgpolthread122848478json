I have a theory that the media they consume (as we all have consumed) doesn&#039;t allow for any appropriate outlet of the negative emotions, like simply feeling sad. Then when people feel sad they feel like something must be terribly wrong with them because no one else ever appears to be sad (see: social media). It&#039;s often a lot easier to feel sorry for yourself than to actually think and confront your uncomfortable personal thoughts","time":1493185176,"resto":122848478,"id":"CBZN9VuM","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122849737,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)01:42:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122848786\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122848786<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;kids with Oppositional Defiance Disorder<\/span><br>It&#039;s because we&#039;re not allowed to call them brats anymore.","time":1493185327,"resto":122848478,"id":"vs2fF\/6Q","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":122850065,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)01:45:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122848709\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122848709<\/a><br>Depression is a reversible state at least, most of the time does not require any medication, but doctors will give them like candies because they are sold to the big pharma<br><br><a href=\"#p122849122\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122849122<\/a><br>Yep, when all they need deep down is better parenting and discipline<br><br><a href=\"#p122849297\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122849297<\/a><br>What is actually crazy?

But I do not believe many disorders of the brain are permanent or curable solely by drugs. Your mind is excessively complex and &quot;being cured&quot; is not straightforward. Mental illnesses can be observed with scans and such because the brain is a physical object. Our thoughts are represented physically. Our being is represented physically. You change the operation of your brain through your pattern of thought. Drugs are not a cure-all and psychiatrists focus too little on their patient&#039;s structure of living.<br><br><a href=\"#p122849494\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122849494<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;they feel like something must be terribly wrong with them<\/span><br>Half the time their condition is a perfectly normal response to their situation.","time":1493186003,"resto":122848478,"id":"NprDtU\/4","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122851049,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)01:56:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122848709\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122848709<\/a><br>you might think this image means something, but it doesnt<br>using the best scientific method, neuroscientists would be completely unable do diagnose depression on brain scans<br>ultimately the most rigorous scientist would ask the patient &#039;&#039;are you depressed?&#039;&#039;<br>take for example the fact that people with autism are2 cm shorter on average. would you say &#039;&#039;autism is real&#039;&#039; and how would you diagnose individual cases based on height? well, same goes for the brain","time":1493186175,"resto":122848478,"id":"JZ4tIs1Z","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"}]}

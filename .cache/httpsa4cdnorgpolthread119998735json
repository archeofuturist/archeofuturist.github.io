Nazi Germany did fall in 1945. That&#039;s about 72 years ago. Anon thinks that Nazi Germany and Soviets were on same side, that or he has no concept of time whatever. Soviets fell around 1991. If you didn&#039;t notice that is not 70 years ago. Also it wasn&#039;t war that caused this, sure there was a Cold War but actual full on war didn&#039;t break out.

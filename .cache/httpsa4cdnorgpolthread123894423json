I&#039;m here to explain to you why a small percentage of liberals go along with the idiocy.<br><br>I&#039;ve been lurking \/pol\/ since 2012. I got drawn in by the CLANKER stuff in Ukraine. I should mention, before we get started, that I agree with almost much of \/pol\/&#039;s stereotypical mantras:<br><br>1. I am a white supremacist.<br>2. I believe that evidence supports the belief in a high ranking circle of extremist Jews that attempt to monopolize important theaters of control.<br>3. I believe in God.<br>4. I think that sovereign states require strict authority in order to flourish.<br>5. I think that the rest of the world should kneel before American hegemony.<br>6. I support Bannon in an abstract way and 100% support Assad.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;BONUS: I seriously entertained the notion of a flat earth for six months last year, until a business associate took me on one of the zero-gravity free-fall flights. <\/span><br><br>So why am I a democrat? The &quot;tl;dr&quot; answer is pretty simple: ---poor people deserve to be manipulated---. But let&#039;s break that down. I often wonder how many people on \/pol\/ are truly poor and\/or how many people on \/pol\/ have been exposed to truly poor people. If you haven&#039;t been, then let me explain. Poor people are completely worthless; they always have been and they always will be. Have you ever seen poor people &quot;compete&quot; with one another over &quot;who had it the hardest&quot;? This is the crux of their idiocy and it is why they deserve to be exploited. They love being slaves. They love being spat on and demeaned. They love being crushed by hopelessness and despair. <br><br>Why is this? The root of it is sexual. Given enough rape, 99% of humans, male and female, will begin to enjoy it. There is a deep arousal that most people find in powerlessness, and, as degree of that powerlessness increases, so does the depth and subtlety of their arousal. <br><br>Another aspect of it is genetic. Nobility exists. And, for better or for worse, an ignoble caste must serve it. <br><br>(1.)","filename":"1487875378774","ext":".png","w":841,"h":528,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":156,"tim":1493803490868,"time":1493803490,"md5":"YVQi11v3UiDxfWRSrv3CaQ==","fsize":792110,"resto":0,"id":"PFGfDv6E","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"rich-democrat-here-im-here-to-explain-to-you-why","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

Hunters and gatherers had more free time, better diets, and for a long time better quality of life than city dwellers. The only thing cities could offer was more security and a constant supply of food (grain), in return for longer working hours, less freedom, and a poorer quality of living. The first people to be attracted to cities were those who were too weak to survive in nature, but even security wasn\u2019t enough to keep people there and so cities created vices to hold onto their population. Alcohol, gambling, whores, all formed as a means to cope living in an unnatural oppressive environment. <br><br>Civilisation has been a constant battle against nature to provide for us what we think we want: We want food, and so we farm grain and cattle and build a diet that less healthy than what we ate before, a diverse variety of animals and plants depending on the season. We want security, so we build walls and weapons that will ultimately be used to oppress and harm us more often than defend us. We want entertainment, so we debase others for our own amusement, those that are too weak or simply afraid of life outside The City. We want to live, and so we learn to treat illness and injury without changing the poor environment created for ourselves. A sick man in The City, who is sickly because of city life may live longer than the healthy man in the wild but who has the better life? We have now gotten to the point where a man who eats and drinks himself into a state of no return will now be cared for and kept alive, almost against his will it might seem, buy hundreds of people for no other purpose but to keep him consuming and keep the workers busy and paid so that they to can consume and keep The City running.","filename":"teddy","ext":".jpg","w":634,"h":702,"tn_w":225,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490107196089,"time":1490107196,"md5":"A96gZmp4dehlA0G4cSnWrg==","fsize":147504,"resto":0,"id":"le7JjM7K","country":"AU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"civilisation-is-what-will-destroy-us","country_name":"Australia","replies":7,"images":2,"unique_ips":6},{"no":117629867,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)10:40:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"The City says it can provide anything nature can even intimacy, or god, a sense of purpose, but cheaper. But all it does is provide man with poor imitations. Neolithic man didn\u2019t need to seek a reason for living, he knew that he enjoyed life and that was enough. Nothing is cheaper than what nature provides, the only problem is that now we may have eradicated our natural environment for The Cities. There is no choice now, you are a city dweller, you are made to be a city dweller, and even if you are competent and strong enough to live wild there is no longer any wilderness.","time":1490107250,"resto":117629791,"id":"le7JjM7K","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":117630321,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)10:45:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117629791\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117629791<\/a><br>Yes, but what are you going to do about it?

And if you haven\u2019t noticed, you have not been paying attention,\u201d campaign spokesman Mike Patton said in a \u201ccampaign update\u201d video put out on social media Tuesday.<br><br>The campaign had sent a fundraising email Monday evening that promised Trost would never participate in gay pride events, and as a political leader would never subsidize such events.<br><br>\u201cFor sure, Brad is not a big fan of the gay lifestyle. But what you do in private is your business. What you literally do in the middle of the street needs to conform to some basic community standards,\u201d Patton said. He called some behaviour in pride parades over-sexualized and \u201cso inappropriate for public viewing.\u201d<br><br>Following the release of the email and video, Trost said in an interview with BuzzFeed Canada that he defines \u201cthe gay lifestyle\u201d as \u201cgay people having gay sex,\u201d and said it is not something he feels is \u201cmoral.\u201d<br><br>Despite immediate online backlash, Patton told the National Post the campaign would not be apologizing.<br><br>\u201cThe campaign has reviewed the video, the email, and the article today and while we can see why some would disagree with Mr. Trost\u2019s feelings about homosexuality, it has been consistent, and we see no reason anyone should take offence,\u201d Patton wrote in an email. \u201cTherefore, we expect no apology forthcoming from Mr. Trost.\u201d","filename":"u mad cucks","ext":".png","w":620,"h":465,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":187,"tim":1490835403381,"time":1490835403,"md5":"morVWrtPM5tiPsAl22pqLA==","fsize":125859,"resto":0,"id":"0mpaVIMn","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"brad-trost-calls-out-the-gay-lifestyle-isnt","country_name":"Canada","replies":7,"images":4,"unique_ips":7},{"no":118860831,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)21:06:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"bump<br><br>Meanwhile Maxime Bernier memers are fine with this.

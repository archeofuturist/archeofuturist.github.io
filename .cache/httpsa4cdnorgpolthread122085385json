You could only have ever picked box A. Now, a perfect predictor by itself does not cause you to take the course of action you end up taking. However, the other important quality of God that comes into play is that he created the universe. Since the ability to perfectly predict the future necessarily implies a perfectly deterministic universe, the only agency you could ascribe in such a universe belongs to the first cause. That is to say, God. So yes, in fact God did make you choose box A by creating a deterministic universe and setting it in motion in such a way that could only result in you pointing at that box.<br><br><a href=\"#p122098922\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122098922<\/a><br>We are not talking in circles, you are failing to provide any useful definition of &quot;free will&quot; and &quot;choice&quot;, and instead avoiding the argument entirely because you know full well that it unravels your entire belief system.","time":1492751246,"resto":122085385,"id":"uQBZlbGC","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122099551,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)01:08:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122099348\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122099348<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Let me replace it with another vague term.<\/span><br>Oh, fucking gee, what could you be trying to pull here?","time":1492751302,"resto":122085385,"id":"LboQ\/G9L","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122099637,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)01:09:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122099466\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122099466<\/a><br>*tips fedora*<br>One day you&#039;re going to blow your autistic brains out","time":1492751359,"resto":122085385,"id":"DKkLc0L2","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122099795,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)01:10:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122085385\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122085385<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;chrisftags: everything that exists had a creator<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;christfags:God had no creator<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;logical conclusion: God doesn&#039;t exist<\/span><br><br>Muzzies makes the same logic.","time":1492751449,"resto":122085385,"id":"vd0NTLew","country":"BD","country_name":"Bangladesh"},{"no":122099804,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)01:10:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122099466\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122099466<\/a><br>Lets say you knew the next ticket to be grabbed was going to be a winning lottery ticket, but the guy in line to get one doesn&#039;t.

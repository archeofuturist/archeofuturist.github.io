The package would wrap up $1.1 trillion in unfinished spending bills and address the Trump administration&#039;s request for an immediate $30 billion in additional Pentagon spending.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The latest Trump proposal, disclosed Tuesday, would eliminate $1.2 billion in National Institutes of Health research grants, a favorite of both parties. The community development block grant program, also popular, would be halved, amounting to a cut of $1.5 billion, and Trump would strip $500 million from a popular grant program for transportation projects. Some of that money would help pay for parts of the wall.<\/span>","filename":"maxresdefault","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":765,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":149,"tim":1491145093733,"time":1491145093,"md5":"5UU4Egd2EXR6qDzwKTweIw==","fsize":145508,"resto":0,"id":"ubMxyuQq","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"trump-calls-for-cuts-on-medical-research-and","country_name":"United States","replies":4,"images":1,"unique_ips":5},{"no":119208151,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)11:08:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"FakeNews","time":1491145722,"resto":119207118,"id":"mjF9Le1n","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119208175,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)11:08:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119207118\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119207118<\/a><br>good.","time":1491145735,"resto":119207118,"id":"5q9JCeC3","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119208245,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)11:09:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119207118\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119207118<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;President Donald Trump is proposing immediate budget cuts of $18 billion from programs like medical research, infrastructure and community grants so U.S. taxpayers, not Mexico, can cover the down payment on the border wall.<\/span><br>The money will be reimbursed, not paid outright.","time":1491145779,"resto":119207118,"id":"AbxIGyg0","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":119208458,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)11:11:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"fake news intensifies<br>Unless you got a source straight from the white house website or Trump&#039;s own mouth, go back to the oven","filename":"1465863030762","ext":".gif","w":180,"h":180,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491145900526,"time":1491145900,"md5":"\/5Q6Mdc9Y5JO4x6Ck0L19g==","fsize":1093482,"resto":119207118,"id":"N\/got8LU","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]}

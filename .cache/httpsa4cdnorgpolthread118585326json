As a child, she wrote insults for children to use on one another, for the cost of a dime. She beat up a boy in high school who was bothering a younger girl, and also hit a nun.[5] Because of her rebellious behavior, her mother sent her to be raised by her grandparents in 1949. Solanas said that her grandfather was a violent alcoholic who often beat her. When she was 15, she left her grandparents and became homeless.[11] In 1953, she gave birth to a son, fathered by a married sailor.[12][a] The child, named David (later David Blackwell by adoption), was taken away from Solanas and she never saw him again.[14][15][16][b]<\/span><br><br>You&#039;re all a bunch of fags these losers are emotionally, sexually and physically abused morons who are into extreme BDSM sex.

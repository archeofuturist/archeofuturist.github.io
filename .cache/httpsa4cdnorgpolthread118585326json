As a child, she wrote insults for children to use on one another, for the cost of a dime. She beat up a boy in high school who was bothering a younger girl, and also hit a nun.[5] Because of her rebellious behavior, her mother sent her to be raised by her grandparents in 1949. Solanas said that her grandfather was a violent alcoholic who often beat her. When she was 15, she left her grandparents and became homeless.[11] In 1953, she gave birth to a son, fathered by a married sailor.[12][a] The child, named David (later David Blackwell by adoption), was taken away from Solanas and she never saw him again.[14][15][16][b]<\/span><br><br>You&#039;re all a bunch of fags these losers are emotionally, sexually and physically abused morons who are into extreme BDSM sex.

Why do we have people calling themselves &quot;non-binary gender fluid transwomen&quot; if it&#039;s really just a socially constructed label that serves not to emancipate them, but rather fit them into a specific mould based on what society expects a non-binary gender fluid transwoman to be?<br><br>Protip: it&#039;s because that person is a special snowflake faggot who needs exterior validation to ensure that they&#039;re not worthless. They derive their worth FROM the labels they impose on themselves and the reactions they can elicit with them. It&#039;s just the vanity of a person who was spoiled throughout their early life to the point that they expect to be praised for every action they take, else-wise their &quot;specialness&quot; won&#039;t be recognized and they&#039;ll feel worthless.","time":1490682648,"resto":118585326,"id":"tmGMn1gI","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118621385,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)02:35:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118617247\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118617247<\/a><br><br>Its perfect","time":1490682951,"resto":118585326,"id":"yN1fbPrx","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118621898,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)02:42:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"I would like to see a debate between Jordan Peterson and Jack Donovan about violence.","time":1490683349,"resto":118585326,"id":"udQxART\/","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":118621917,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)02:42:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"My only exposure to him is from his two Sam Harris podcast visits.

Such attributes are normally distributed. You have a constellation of these attributes and that makes you who you are. Recognise that the substantial ones are invariant.<br><br>You must satisfy your invariant instincts or you will be at odds with your own character.

Your perception is of a world so vast that that you can not envisage your actions making a meaningful difference. <br> To meaningfully interact with the world, you have to either constrain your perception of what it is back to valley proportions by eschewing all global information (most of us here have engaged on just the opposite course which is what has provoked this discussion), losing your sense of perspective, or start seriously engaging with the modern perception of the world. <br><br> Do not be concerned about when one is to do good, who defines good, etc. Act in the way you do because to do otherwise would to be at odds would to be at odds with yourself. Being on a path true to your character carries with it a state of flow, where the thoughts about your next step come upon waking, unbidden, but welcome. <br><br>t. julian assange","time":1493903293,"resto":124055810,"id":"B+OPPybK","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":124058383,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)09:09:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124055810\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124055810<\/a><br>Yeah haha why even care about anything beyond your bedroom haha as long as mommy brings the chicken tendies why would you even bother to hold any morals or values lol","filename":"who is it6","ext":".jpg","w":368,"h":376,"tn_w":122,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493903384452,"time":1493903384,"md5":"VNMYS9vxWNHvPScpRAtT3g==","fsize":12034,"resto":124055810,"id":"sbgSFnEz","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124058409,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)09:10:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124055810\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124055810<\/a><br>Someone has to car","time":1493903407,"resto":124055810,"id":"5esMG6cW","country":"RO","country_name":"Romania"},{"no":124058432,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)09:10:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124058409\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124058409<\/a><br>care*","time":1493903424,"resto":124055810,"id":"5esMG6cW","country":"RO","country_name":"Romania"}]}

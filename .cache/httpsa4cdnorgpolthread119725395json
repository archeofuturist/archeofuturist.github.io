The Grand Mosque of Paris recently got a modern, fully retractable Roof, usually only found in football stadiums. Hundreds of new mosques are built every year in France, often with taxpayer money.","filename":"TFxbA","ext":".png","w":663,"h":359,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":135,"tim":1491471210218,"time":1491471210,"md5":"ere2Miv46ZVESd\/4REAU1g==","fsize":258896,"resto":0,"id":"xsSXgz4K","country":"AU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"another-french-church-being-demolished-another","country_name":"Australia","replies":8,"images":2,"unique_ips":8},{"no":119725549,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)05:35:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"lmao","time":1491471359,"resto":119725395,"id":"sXEw03hk","country":"TR","country_name":"Turkey"},{"no":119725582,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)05:36:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119725395\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119725395<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Another Mosque To Be Built<\/span><br><br>But they&#039;re not building a mosque there at all, anon.","time":1491471389,"resto":119725395,"id":"gtBwFV+k","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":119725652,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)05:37:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119725582\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119725582<\/a><br>C&#039;est une m\u00e9taphore gros malin.<br>We build mosques, not churches.","time":1491471454,"resto":119725395,"id":"SQx+5Lna","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":119725799,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)05:40:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"what the fuck is happening to Europe?","time":1491471611,"resto":119725395,"id":"pGGeO\/KF","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119725851,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)05:40:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119725652\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119725652<\/a><br>Who cares?","time":1491471654,"resto":119725395,"id":"gtBwFV+k","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":119726065,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)05:44:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119725799\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119725799<\/a><br>No one is going to church anymore and people are increasingly turning inwards and not giving a shit about their community.","time":1491471848,"resto":119725395,"id":"pJ6TWUY+","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119726069,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)05:44:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"This is old footage but still makes me mad.","filename":"1488222213850","ext":".png","w":524,"h":601,"tn_w":108,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491471852423,"time":1491471852,"md5":"C47H9yv+yzu3A1nTmuG3XQ==","fsize":273635,"resto":119725395,"id":"JFd3gjzU","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":119726078,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)05:44:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119725851\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119725851<\/a>","filename":"1489150216373","ext":".jpg","w":513,"h":450,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":109,"tim":1491471858135,"time":1491471858,"md5":"EqThMtqkjetlJx1ufikb3A==","fsize":30337,"resto":119725395,"id":"jBgDzhLX","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"}]}

For Jesus Christ came as a man (the voice of God as human) and yet He said even if He judges His judgement is true, for was Christ Jesus not also Baptized having He and God becoming One in the spirit by being given The Holy Spirit? The day of Judgement is everything God sees through the eyes of His Christian Children who again God sees out of. Yea, God the One true God can look at you through the Baptized and any those who know God with Jesus and Holy Spirit wills. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;what if by birth if all imagined right from the first to the last it has only been about a day.<\/span><br><br>May the Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.","filename":"image","ext":".jpg","w":576,"h":717,"tn_w":200,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492954017271,"time":1492954017,"md5":"aZtzyIhOFk7qjh2+OqGrfg==","fsize":139149,"resto":0,"id":"gX00cAJk","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-day-you-were-born-is-judgement-day-for-as","country_name":"Canada","replies":3,"images":0,"unique_ips":1},{"no":122424684,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)09:39:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"I am there for those of Ukrainian, and I remember their holocaust of the holodomour. You Russia have stomped upon the yellow fields of their vallies and turned the blue on their flag red with the blood of those the world has forgotten moreso. And those who represent Israel are never allowing theirs to be questioned or compared for the sake of learning by even denying the communist committed genocide of the Ukranian people and their Holodomor? <br><br>There&#039;s a lesson to be learned here easily. It&#039;s as if they don&#039;t know the difference between red white and blue.. As of they think yellow is there too. So they acted in violence yet does God not own all land and have given it&#039;s traditions though The Holy Bible is with all by being given to all? Before mankind was, all the dirt of the Earth was His. You never know, all things being possible unto God the land of Ukraine could be near an are where in the next earth new Jerusalem was sent down! Have we forgotten truly where the tribes came from? And that racial awareness exists as a means of not knowing where The Garden of Eden was located? Yet there is a chosen people by God for Adam and Eve yes were of the same race by the rib of Adam. That&#039;s ok just accept that and racial awareness can peacefully have it&#039;s place and traditions. I also know of the thing this board knows obviously. Would I not?","time":1492954792,"resto":122423461,"id":"gX00cAJk","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122425669,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)09:49:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"Remember though there is a conspiracy, away from the internet and the screen what have your two eyes beheld?

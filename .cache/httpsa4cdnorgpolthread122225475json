The doctors simply want to see as many people as possible with minimal effort, they are not concerned with doing any proper investigations or actually caring about your health. I&#039;ve had about 12 interactions in 6 months, some so utterly pathetic I simply had to change doctors and &quot;start again.&quot; Most of them in my area are Muslim Pajeets (stay away from this kind). Each time they see you for about 5 minutes and then boom you&#039;re gone, they get $75 or something direct from the government. Then you go to the pharmacist and the government pays them too. Everyone earning a decent wage is taxed to pay for it all, and everyone gets shit care especially if you can&#039;t pay for the private system. Finally I get a referral for a specialist, and you have to wait for ages for that! This could and should have been fixed months ago!!!!

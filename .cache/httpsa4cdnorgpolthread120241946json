His teaching also contained precepts that were in conformity with his promises, and he gave free rein to carnal pleasure. In all this, as is not unexpected; he was obeyed by carnal men. As for proofs of the truth of his doctrine, he brought forward only such as could be grasped by the natural ability of anyone with a very modest wisdom. Indeed, the truths that he taught he mingled with many fables and with doctrines of the greatest falsity.<br><br>He did not bring forth any signs produced in a supernatural way, which alone fittingly gives witness to divine inspiration; for a visible action that can be only divine reveals an invisibly inspired teacher of truth. On the Contrary, Mohammed said that he was sent in the power of his arms - which are signs not lacking even to robbers and tyrants. What is more, no wise men, men trained in things divine and human, believed in him from the beginning (1). Those who believed in him were brutal men and desert wanderers, utterly ignorant of all divine teaching, through whose numbers Mohammed forced others to become his follower&#039;s by the violence of his arms. Nor do divine pronouncements on part of preceding prophets offer him any witness. On the contrary, he perverts almost all the testimony of the Old and the New Testaments by making them into a fabrication of his own, as can be seen by anyone who examines his law. It was, therefore, a shrewd decision on his part to forbid his followers to read the Old and New Testaments, lest these books convict him of falsity. It is thus clear that those who place faith in his words believe foolishly.","filename":"Thomas-Aquinas-Black-large-216x300","ext":".jpg","w":216,"h":300,"tn_w":90,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491714620806,"time":1491714620,"md5":"dJ8XOfv5xz51+5chPIP9Iw==","fsize":22076,"resto":120241946,"id":"MwmWb2T8","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120242173,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)01:10:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120242115\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120242115<\/a><br>fpbp?<br>fpbp","time":1491714640,"resto":120241946,"id":"rPK4pJDU","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120242461,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)01:13:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"There is no GOD but KEK and Pepe is his prophet.","time":1491714791,"resto":120241946,"id":"XMsj1Kqe","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

Are they hoping that the man is going to release them so that pore over them trying to find evidence of some kind of impropriety?

Clinton released hers and while she had a high tax rate she was a ZOG shill who said that politicians should have secret policies and opinions that are opposite to their public views. Also she was a con-artist with the Foundation. Not to mention that everyone&#039;s been planning to run for president for at least the last few years so if they&#039;re smart they&#039;re going to run business a little differently to look good as no one ever asks for the returns from the last 5 years.<br><br>I don&#039;t get it.","filename":"1040-image","ext":".jpg","w":270,"h":313,"tn_w":215,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492366160270,"time":1492366160,"md5":"2HWEnGKc+ezoM4qgOyl\/FA==","fsize":22541,"resto":0,"id":"4zAqK7XI","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"drumpf-must-release-his-tax-returns","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":121390982,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)14:11:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121390721\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121390721<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I don&#039;t get it.<\/span><br>It&#039;s pretty simple actually: if he have nothing to hide then he have nothing to fear.","time":1492366287,"resto":121390721,"id":"+ksvZEPe","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121391230,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)14:13:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121390721\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121390721<\/a><br>Taxes are tyrannical, I&#039;d have more respect for him if all of his money was in off shore tax havens.","time":1492366407,"resto":121390721,"id":"QqBrL4AU","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

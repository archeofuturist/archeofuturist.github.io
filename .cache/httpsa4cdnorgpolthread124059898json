There were three basic racial classifications under the law: Black, White and Coloured (mixed). Indians (that is, South Asians from the former British India, and their descendants) were later added as a separate classification as they were seen as having &quot;no historical right to the country&quot;.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;An Office for Race Classification was set up to overview the classification process. Classification into groups was carried out using criteria such as outer appearance, general acceptance and social standing. For example, it defined a &quot;white person&quot; as one who &quot;in appearance is obviously a white person who is generally not accepted as a coloured person; or is generally accepted as a white person and is not in appearance obviously a white person.&quot; Because some aspects of the profile were of a social nature, reclassification was not uncommon, and a board was established to conduct that process. For example, the following criteria were used for separating the coloureds from the whites:<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Characteristics of the person&#039;s head hair<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Characteristics of the person&#039;s other hair<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Skin colour<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Facial features<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Area where the person lives, the person&#039;s friends and acquaintances<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Employment<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Socioeconomic status<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Eating and drinking habits<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;This law worked in tandem with other laws passed as part of the apartheid system. Under the Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act of 1949, it was illegal for a white person to marry a person of another race. With the enactment of the Immorality Amendment Act of 1950, it also became a crime for a white person and a person of another race to have sexual intercourse.<\/span>","time":1493908864,"resto":124059898,"id":"AvH8i\/Yo","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124066307,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)10:44:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124066004\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124066004<\/a><br>Nice, but sounds outdated by today&#039;s standards.

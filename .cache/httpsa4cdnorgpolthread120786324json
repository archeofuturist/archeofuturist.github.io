At this point they were so close that they addressed each other as du (the German familiar form of &quot;you&quot;). No other top Nazi leader enjoyed that privilege, and their close association led to rumors that Hitler himself was homosexual.[6] R\u00f6hm was the only Nazi leader who dared to address Hitler by his first name &quot;Adolf&quot; or his nickname &quot;Adi&quot; rather than &quot;mein F\u00fchrer.&quot;[5]<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;...and Fascism is for submissive.<\/span><br><br>Fascism is for submissives looking for a strong man father figure. Those who follow fascists are by definition followers &amp; weaklings.<br><br>Fascism comes from the term &#039;fasces&#039;; a bundle of sticks wrapped around (one could say in rapture to) an axe handle.<br><br>This is the core metaphor that drives fascism. That the many must give their will power up to the one (a strong man leader).<br><br>This ideology is by definition about weak people looking to give up their own power or direction (and giving up their own rights and freedoms in the process). To usurp themselves, to be submissive... ergo the whole ideology is one of weakness. Fascists are the most submissive &amp; weak people.<br><br>You know I&#039;m fine with people who want to be strong, who want to be an authority; but being a leader is about genuinely giving others HELP in exploring their own individual strengths, not about claiming the authority of a collective of submissives as if that makes you strong. It doesn&#039;t; it makes for the weakest ideology possible. Fascism is deflationary, it poses the biggest lie, and is hence comprised of the biggest fools.<br><br>A human should be a human beyond all states; &amp; hence able to inhabit all states. Fascism is nihilistic to individual authority &amp; hence is nothing but a fragile empty shell that looks tough but ultimately hides deep weakness; fascism contains some of the most submissive and damaged people possible. People in need of a genuine strength; but looking in the wrong place.","filename":"Germany_Hitler_Roehm2_280x295","ext":".jpg","w":280,"h":295,"tn_w":237,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492020897972,"time":1492020897,"md5":"OIkvf\/cOoBMkJFOSdM8bPg==","fsize":30156,"resto":0,"id":"fza2127j","country":"AU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"reminder-hitler-was-most-likely-gay-with-pic","country_name":"Australia","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

the importance of the events are always downplayed and understimated.<br>We are heading towards a war not fought with conventional weapons such as say guns or artillery barrages or even airstrikes, we are heading literally towards total nuclear war and no one is doing anything to prevent it, in fact every single fucking politician on the globe wants to promote a war between the Nuclear powers.<br>Thing is that nowadays everyone has nukes, literally everyone except irrelevant third world countries, in other words if USA, would say Nuke the life of Russia it would get nuked out of existance in return, after the two big holders of powers are gone the minor countries are going to use nukes to wipe out their competitors, this will lead to earth either being left absolutely

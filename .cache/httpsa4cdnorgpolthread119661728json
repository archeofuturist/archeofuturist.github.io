Baring the obvious cases of people loosing large chunks of their bodies, ballistics like shrapnel are easy to recover from and most of the time lead to no long term health problems<br><br>the second problem with using chemical weapons is the fact they are very hard to control once dispersed. Once a chemical weapon has been detonated there is no way of controlling were the chemicals were go. A strong would could pick up and gas the town a mile down the road instead of the military target you were trying to hit. They cause a lot of collateral damage which is something people generally try to reduce<br><br><br>third problem is the fact that chemical weapons are really only effective against soft targets and civilians. military targets are already equipped to handle chemical attacks (your average gi has a mask) so the only people these chemicals will effect are civilians.

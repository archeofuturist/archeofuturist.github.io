You are just saying that the rich should have access to better healthcare.<br><br>I&#039;m pretty sure almost every single country that has public healthcare also has private healthcare - we do in this country. So everyone is entitled to the same standard of state healthcare, but also you can pay to have better healthcare at a private hospital, if you can afford it.

E.g. I know that my right to privacy is slightly curbed, by the fact that GCHQ (one of Britain&#039;s spy agencies) can read my emails and stuff if they want. But I am okay with that. Because I want them to catch terrorists. And also I know that I am not doing anything that would cause GCHQ to look at my communications.<br><br>For me, it&#039;s not excessive, so I&#039;d disagree with the statement.","filename":"tmay16","ext":".jpg","w":680,"h":382,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1492783562292,"time":1492783562,"md5":"TVvCT6RccUEOLEFHrppClw==","fsize":66804,"resto":122132350,"id":"Wbj3qoy\/","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122138920,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)10:07:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122138523\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122138523<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Unfortunately pure Ancap doesn&#039;t work any better than pure socialism.<\/span><br><br>We have a prophet here","time":1492783636,"resto":122132350,"id":"18wVxues","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":122139005,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)10:08:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122138798\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122138798<\/a><br>I guess it is a stretch to ask a Brit to think outside of any system that doesn&#039;t involve oppressive colonialism.","time":1492783704,"resto":122132350,"id":"eM3u\/9gp","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122139017,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)10:08:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122137400\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122137400<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;We disapprove of state education.

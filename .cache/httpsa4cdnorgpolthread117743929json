Look at the mindset of the Western establishment.<br><br>After Trump\u2019s win, much of enlightened America was plunged into mourning. Students were crying, teachers canceled lectures to calm them down, \u201chotline\u201d started working to help desperate people.<br><br>In the USSR such mass hysteria happened only after Stalin\u2019s death, when people cried thinking that it was the end of the world.<br><br>What brought American students to such despair? They are unlikely to be able to explain it, but it\u2019s a very dangerous syndrome of mass insanity.<br><br>A man seeing a girl subjected to sexual harassment would stand up for her if he could. Situations similar to the incident in Cologne last year could not have happened during the Soviet era in in Moscow or St. Petersburg.<br><br>It was absolutely unthinkable that political officials in the USSR would justify rapists and accuse their victims on the grounds of immodesty. It was inconceivable that the Politburo members welcomed the mockery of their own children and protected rapists as happens regularly in Western Europe.<br><br>I can\u2019t imagine that the Soviet court would justify the rape of a child, as was the case in Austria; or care about the future of migrants, which mocked and raped a child, as it happened in Sweden. Authorities in Sweden decided not to deport Afghan migrants who committed a gang rape of the boy, because it was not safe in Afghanistan.<br><br>Brezhnev would never say that if the situation in Cologne took place in St. Petersburg, \u201cSexual harassment is not automatically binding to migration and immigration\u201d, as stated by the Swedish Prime Minister Stefan L\u00f6fven.","filename":"Tot","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":380,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":158,"tim":1490176669463,"time":1490176669,"md5":"x12PN\/5wFKOB68dDj4uHQw==","fsize":63220,"resto":0,"id":"1\/\/Fn5cb","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"western-cultural-totalitarianism-will-it-put","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":2,"images":0,"unique_ips":1},{"no":117743986,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)05:58:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"Soviet students didn\u2019t ask to remove Plato and Descartes from their syllabus simply because they were white, as students of London University did, when they replaced them with philosophers from Africa and Asia. Who exactly? Louis Farrakhan perhaps? Why not?<br><br>No one dared to reject the great culture because it was created by \u201cDead White European Males\u201d (DWEM).<br><br>Nobody could think to replace the picture of Shakespeare with the picture of Audre Lorde, an African American writer, civil rights activist and self-described \u201cblack, lesbian, mother, warrior, poet\u201d, as students at the University of Pennsylvania did.<br><br>None of the Soviet Communists would have said what George Ciccariello-Maher, an associate professor of political science at Drexel University in Philadelphia said, \u201cAll I Want for Christmas is White Genocide.\u201d<br><br>Soviet party members used Western colonialism in their propaganda. But none of them could afford to use such notions as \u201cWhite savagery\u201d and \u201cWhite ferocity\u201d, as a Rosa Amelia Plumelle-Uribe did.

Well! However it suppressed all religions, without exception. It didn\u2019t mock Judaism and Christianity, while at same time glorifying one single religion \u2014 Islam.

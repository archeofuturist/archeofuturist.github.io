Their spirits can never be separated from the circles of the earth. That is why Elves are immortal. Even when their bodies parish, their spirits are brought back to the holy lands of the Valar where they wait in teh halls of mandos, potentially receiving a chance at incarnation. Men on the other hand have a restless spirit that desires (and is destined) to escape the confines of Arda. One represents the perfection of earthly existence, marred and fallen from grace, whereas the other represents spiritual perfection fallen from grace.","time":1491770377,"resto":120332319,"id":"PPdr0ubp","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120333390,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)16:41:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120332319\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120332319<\/a><br>the dwarves represent jews","time":1491770469,"resto":120332319,"id":"tyTb\/GTM","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

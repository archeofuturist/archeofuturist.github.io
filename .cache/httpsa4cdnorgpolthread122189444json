ONE girl wrecked the same crew GTA V three times. First time, she joined and starting being more vocal than anyone on Social Club.

Literally accused me of harassing her because I didn&#039;t ban someone who she said had killed her (it was he said she said because neither recorded the incident despite having that feature on the xbone). She eventually attacked one of the commissioners like this. He kicked her immediately. They let her back in for some reason. Turns out, she was like the internet girlfriend of one of the commissioners this time. This allowed her to get away with bullshit for much longer until both she and the commissioner were eventually kicked. Comes back a third time. Somehow gets promoted to lieutenant. At this point it was clear what was going to happen so me and a shit load of other guys just split off and made a better crew.

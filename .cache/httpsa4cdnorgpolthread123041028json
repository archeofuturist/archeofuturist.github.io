We then have to accept that it is mentally possible to be permanently some combination of these two. There is no reason to believe there is such a thing as being mentally male or female, as &quot;sex&quot; only refers to physical, measurable properties, and there is no definition for male or female mentality based on any objectively, permanentaly existent state of mind, much less is it measurable. There is neither a reason to believe there is such a thing as being mentally some combination of male and female, as there is no definition for any combination of male and female mentality based on any objectively, permanentaly existent state of mind, much less is it measurable. Even if it were accepted that these exist, they are still not measurable and thus, people are not qualified to, and have no right to, either decide what combination of male and female they are mentally, or demand other people recognize and acknowledge their self-designation. Until such things are actually determined to exist objectively, there is no reason to believe &quot;gender identity&quot; is anything but fantasy.","time":1493306560,"resto":123041028,"id":"cM\/B3Hlf","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123046959,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)11:23:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123041308\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123041308<\/a>","filename":"IMG_6834","ext":".jpg","w":225,"h":224,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":124,"tim":1493306626012,"time":1493306626,"md5":"JBIdlcPFGdumWq4vIo8BCg==","fsize":23474,"resto":123041028,"id":"h2ssT0Zq","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123047131,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)11:25:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123042011\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123042011<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Special snowflake syndrome has gotten so completely out of hand that I can call myself a male lesbian and people will take me seriously.<\/span><br><br>And that&#039;s what worries me the most.

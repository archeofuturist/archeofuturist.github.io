More people voted Leave or abstained from voting. The SNP are not listening to Leave voters just like they ignored the No voters in 2014.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; As long as people refuse to go to the polls in elections thinking that they have no chance of kicking the SNP out, they will remain in power.

There&#039;s been plenty of talk that the SNP might actually LOSE this in favour of the Tories, but who knows at the end of the day.

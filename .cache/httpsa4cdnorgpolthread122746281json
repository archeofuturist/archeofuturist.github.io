Which kind is most acceptable? If you have to tell stupid people the man in the sky will smite them for them to behave is it really that big of a deal? I think most religion is harmless. No one is forcing you to go along with it either. In the USA there are very few consequences of letting people practice it vs banning it would cause people to want to fight to keep it. IMO that would be way worse. Let people believe in what they want. In the real world it really doesn&#039;t make that much of a difference. You could pick and choose times where it would seem religion is bad overall but those costs outweigh the gains of banning religion.","time":1493137508,"resto":122746281,"id":"0BSOTGV\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

Rather, it&#039;s more of a conflict with &quot;Generation Z&quot; and millennials. I&#039;m a gen Z kid. Observing first hand my peers I&#039;d say us and millennials are incomparable. To us millennials are a laughing stock. Walking down the hallways at my school you always hear jokes about triggering people and how they need a safe space. My school district is also very left wing. We are common core and my English class has a unit called racism and privilege. They try to indoctrinate but it fails. As soon as we leave a class riddled with liberal propaganda we laugh and make jokes about it. Also you have to keep in mind we are the most &quot;racist&quot; generation. When ever we have our fun it&#039;s plastered in the paper a day later as bigoted. No one likes being told they are evil, nazi, fascist, homophobic, transphobic, Xenophobic, sexist, privileged, and fuck farm animals. When ever we talk in school about identification someone yells out attach helicopter. Then the events that are shaping my generation are contributing as well. We see the news lying, we were born in an era where the US has been at perpetual war. We have to worry about terrorism, we watched our parents struggle in the financial crash, and we have seen whining basement dwellers not much older then us tearing through cities destroying shit. My most liberal classmates talk about how they can&#039;t read huff post, buzzfead, or any other extreme left news source. We&#039;ll see how we turn out but I have a feeling there will be far more gen Z CEO&#039;s then millennial COE&#039;s.","time":1491461576,"resto":119716019,"id":"cG5ynKuM","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119716416,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)02:59:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119716019\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119716019<\/a><br>Why not just archive you fucking shitskin rapebaby<br><br>https:\/\/archive.is\/K7sxB","time":1491461960,"resto":119716019,"id":"9d\/dLKHX","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":119716626,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)03:03:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"Gen z being majority right leaning and conservative is a meme.

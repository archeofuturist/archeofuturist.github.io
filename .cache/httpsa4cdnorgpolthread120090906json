Do you see any of the symbols in the pic on your food anywhere? If so congrats! You are directly supporting the Talmudic Globalist Zionist Marxist Jews! <br><br>So how does this work you ask? very simple<br><br>Step 1: Either a company submits to kosherization, or jewish distributors and jewish run supermarkets will simply refuse to stock your products. (Guess what? That pretty much all of them) That&#039;s how it all starts. <br><br>Step 2: The \u201cfee\u201d for the blessing (curse), is paid by the corporation that manufactures the product, and must be paid for each product made, so a company like General Foods can pay hundreds of these \u201cfees\u201d each year. <br><br>These \u201cfees\u201d are passed on to you, the consumer, regardless of whether you are jewish or not. Every expense a company incurs in production of a product for sale, is naturally offset in the price of each product sold. This includes advertising costs, business operating costs, etc. ALL for profit businesses operate in this fashion. If the business occurs an expense in bringing you a product, YOU the consumer pay said expense, period.<br><br>Step 3: How much does the Jew make off this tax? Hard to say today for sure but<br><br>&quot;In 1975 the cost per item for obtaining kosher certification was estimated by The New York Times as being 6.5 millionths (0.0000065) of a cent per item for a General Foods frozen-food item.&quot;<br><br>&amp; <br><br>&quot;Manufacturers pay supervisory agencies between $1,000 and $5,000 a year to inspect their plants and certify a product. The cost depends on the complexity of a product. For instance, a food with sensitive ingredients like emulsifiers and flavors requires more surveillance by a rabbi.&quot;<br><br>The total size of the US Grocery Market is roughly $600 Billion (https:\/\/www.statista.com\/topics\/16<wbr>60\/food-retail\/)<br><br>So even if you believe the low number from what the Jews told the NY times, they are still making 4 million dollars off Kosher food that Goys\/NON Jews eat.<br><br>Step 4: PROFIT! <br><br>THANKS GOYS!","filename":"kosher-tax-extortion-300x291","ext":".jpg","w":300,"h":291,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":242,"tim":1491628391724,"time":1491628391,"md5":"Sz7taMH8vtrRjWZpcp960Q==","fsize":28197,"resto":0,"id":"7y4G37P3","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"do-you-buy-food-then-guess-what-you-are-paying-a","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":120091097,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)01:15:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120090906\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120090906<\/a><br>What?

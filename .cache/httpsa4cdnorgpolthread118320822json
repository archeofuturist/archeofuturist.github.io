Those lookups are basically two computers checking the DNS for each other&#039;s location. Think of an online phone book that two servers have to find one another&#039;s number in before they can communicate.<br><br>So the way the communication can be identified by a 3rd party is to access the &#039;phone book&#039; (DNS server) that they used to call eachother. There are logs of these looksups, and these computer scientists (tea leaves) were snooping around in those logs, looking for &#039;interesting&#039; information.<br><br>They claim they just stumbled upon the lookups for Trump&#039;s email server, and they accidentally noticed that they were going to, and coming from, a Russian bank.<br><br>In reality, there&#039;s almost ZERO possibility such things would be noticed without a targeted search, but the cover story allows just enough plausibility that they can hide behind it. So, what likely happened is that the logs themselves were simply faked - tailor made to justify a FISA request, or some other surviellance request.<br><br>The way the two servers look each other up is wrong in the logs. No servers of those types would do the sorts of requests that the logs indicate. And what&#039;s more, it&#039;s not just one server that&#039;s doing it... BOTH servers are doing it (requsting recursive lookups).<br><br>So, either BOTH servers are acting weird and are misconfigured to make the wrong kind of requests, or... Someone fucked up when they falsified the logs.<br><br>Occam&#039;s razor says that the logs are falsified.

And these are only the 19 the author was able to observe in a short time period \u2014 it can\u2019t be ruled out that there were many more, which quickly deflates the portrait of a shady Russian backchannel.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The white paper included DNS look-up data, but not nearly enough to reproduce the results. Rather than the 19 IP addresses we expected to see, the data only included three, and the DNS look-ups were not for the same time period that the paper described. Tea Leaves published a different set of data on the dark web, which we also looked at, but this set of data only included a total of four IP addresses. When we pressed Tea Leaves for the complete set of data so we could attempt to reproduce the analysis, he gave us a new, more comprehensive set of data, but still that included a total of only eight IP addresses, and it was missing an IP address belonging to a VPN service in Utah that accounted for a significant portion of the DNS look-ups described in the paper.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What percentage of DNS look-ups for Trump\u2019s email server could Tea Leaves and his colleagues observe, out of all DNS look-ups for that server on the whole internet? How can they be sure that the majority of DNS look-ups for Trump\u2019s email server originated from Alfa Bank, when much of the data they collected didn\u2019t even include DNS look-ups from IPs described in their own paper? What\u2019s their margin of error? None of the analysis that we (and other journalists) obtained answered these questions.<\/span>","time":1490514734,"resto":118320822,"id":"BAh\/ZFrg","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118336477,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)03:57:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"Tactical bump of awesome justaficanoliotudiousnesstitude","filename":"1465663577163","ext":".png","w":240,"h":200,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":104,"tim":1490515041333,"time":1490515041,"md5":"Cog5U8Tf0qQF25Ai8rgq6w==","fsize":31353,"resto":118320822,"id":"g1xRr+46","country":"BE","country_name":"Belgium"},{"no":118336501,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)03:57:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118334653\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118334653<\/a><br>meant for<br><a href=\"#p118323406\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118323406<\/a>","filename":"1484943730259","ext":".png","w":658,"h":901,"tn_w":91,"tn_h":124,"tim":1490515060795,"time":1490515060,"md5":"qZ+pH6HjL+T0chH\/E3\/m1g==","fsize":76789,"resto":118320822,"id":"EHWco5zW","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118336580,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)03:58:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"Can you fucking summarize this in the OP?<br><br>I can&#039;t be fucked reading through this shit","time":1490515127,"resto":118320822,"id":"eEfTVMAd","country":"NZ","country_name":"New Zealand"},{"no":118336681,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)04:00:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118336477\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118336477<\/a><br>Follow the numbers...","filename":"1497231692361","ext":".jpg","w":4000,"h":2667,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1490515204238,"time":1490515204,"md5":"+NQZpssApJHmtsLwYPsMYg==","fsize":3611140,"resto":118320822,"id":"EHWco5zW","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":118336788,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)04:01:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118333689\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118333689<\/a><br>(((You)))r free reply<br><br>The ovens are warming up.","time":1490515289,"resto":118320822,"id":"xsOsSp4B","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118336884,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)04:02:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118330419\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118330419<\/a><br>Tech boy releases proof on first how to spoof emails and second how Hilldog worker spoofed said emails <br><br>even shorter hilldog worker planted fake evidence","time":1490515369,"resto":118320822,"id":"6+NEfKRy","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118337133,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)04:06:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"Bump","filename":"1489994865973","ext":".jpg","w":595,"h":550,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":115,"tim":1490515571455,"time":1490515571,"md5":"H+deqdOS\/j+sBcXYy3rvaw==","fsize":66958,"resto":118320822,"id":"DDIUQezZ","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":118337197,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)04:07:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118336788\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118336788<\/a><br>liberals are mentally ill and deserve the flame and fume","time":1490515631,"resto":118320822,"id":"EznO3l+Q","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118337940,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)04:17:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118336788\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118336788<\/a><br><a href=\"#p118337133\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118337133<\/a><br>Thread is sliding fast.

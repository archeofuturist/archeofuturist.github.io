Those lookups are basically two computers checking the DNS for each other&#039;s location. Think of an online phone book that two servers have to find one another&#039;s number in before they can communicate.<br><br>So the way the communication can be identified by a 3rd party is to access the &#039;phone book&#039; (DNS server) that they used to call eachother. There are logs of these looksups, and these computer scientists (tea leaves) were snooping around in those logs, looking for &#039;interesting&#039; information.<br><br>They claim they just stumbled upon the lookups for Trump&#039;s email server, and they accidentally noticed that they were going to, and coming from, a Russian bank.<br><br>In reality, there&#039;s almost ZERO possibility such things would be noticed without a targeted search, but the cover story allows just enough plausibility that they can hide behind it. So, what likely happened is that the logs themselves were simply faked - tailor made to justify a FISA request, or some other surviellance request.<br><br>The way the two servers look each other up is wrong in the logs. No servers of those types would do the sorts of requests that the logs indicate. And what&#039;s more, it&#039;s not just one server that&#039;s doing it... BOTH servers are doing it (requsting recursive lookups).<br><br>So, either BOTH servers are acting weird and are misconfigured to make the wrong kind of requests, or... Someone fucked up when they falsified the logs.<br><br>Occam&#039;s razor says that the logs are falsified. And of course, they were falsified to justify an intelligence community focus on Trump so they could do surveillance on him.","time":1490505464,"resto":118320822,"id":"GibiAnVg","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118323773,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)01:18:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"Bump.","time":1490505517,"resto":118320822,"id":"nBnU9RW9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118323799,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)01:18:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118323325\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118323325<\/a><br>Maybe, but first we need to put all our efforts as a nation into finding pic related.

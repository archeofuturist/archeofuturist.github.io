Hear me out on this.<br><br>This board is a fucking mess and you all know it. Between the influx of ledditors, people who call themselves alt-right and convinced this is their place to thrive, leftists who just want to troll because they know the userbase of this board will eat it up like candy, people who just take shit too fucking seriously at times, this place is a mess. This place has become a board where if people say they&#039;re gonna kill themselves, people&#039;s first response is to convince them they&#039;re WINNING and not to do it to save their redpilled brother instead of encouraging them.<br><br>This place is an ungodly mixing pot between people who just like to come here for fun, redditors, alt right cucks, and leftists. There should be another \/pol\/ Harbor to remind people what kind of website this actually is. That this board was made as a containment board and not just to suck Republican cock. You know nobody actually enjoys this place anymore.<br><br>We&#039;ll lose a month of \/pol\/ during the Trump presidency, that sucks, but it&#039;ll send a clear message to shills and scare off the redditors. Lose \/pol\/ for a month while everyone gets a free pass to raid, douse this place with kerosene and light a match, then come back to a shill free \/pol\/.<br><br>Plus, it&#039;d be fun.","filename":"125_S1Ep5","ext":".png","w":1920,"h":1080,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1490905164352,"time":1490905164,"md5":"eA9lw8Erlcac2BVw3C5KwA==","fsize":2034212,"resto":0,"id":"Gf\/yLc59","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"at-this-point-im-convinced-another-pol-harbor","country_name":"United States","replies":4,"images":1,"unique_ips":5},{"no":118963212,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)16:23:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118962680\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118962680<\/a><br>Next level shilling OP","filename":"3756735626245624","ext":".png","w":248,"h":255,"tn_w":121,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490905430216,"time":1490905430,"md5":"WQ+P7W5xkwiBQKY8lrmaVA==","fsize":85709,"resto":118962680,"id":"KbkBCO+E","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118963454,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)16:25:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118962680\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118962680<\/a><br>so called &quot;shill&quot; here.

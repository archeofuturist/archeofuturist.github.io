Hear me out on this.<br><br>This board is a fucking mess and you all know it. Between the influx of ledditors, people who call themselves alt-right and convinced this is their place to thrive, leftists who just want to troll because they know the userbase of this board will eat it up like candy, people who just take shit too fucking seriously at times, this place is a mess. This place has become a board where if people say they&#039;re gonna kill themselves, people&#039;s first response is to convince them they&#039;re WINNING and not to do it to save their redpilled brother instead of encouraging them.<br><br>This place is an ungodly mixing pot between people who just like to come here for fun, redditors, alt right cucks, and leftists. There should be another \/pol\/ Harbor to remind people what kind of website this actually is. That this board was made as a containment board and not just to suck Republican cock. You know nobody actually enjoys this place anymore.<br><br>We&#039;ll lose a month of \/pol\/ during the Trump presidency, that sucks, but it&#039;ll send a clear message to shills and scare off the redditors. Lose \/pol\/ for a month while everyone gets a free pass to raid, douse this place with kerosene and light a match, then come back to a shill free \/pol\/.<br><br>Plus, it&#039;d be fun.","filename":"125_S1Ep5","ext":".png","w":1920,"h":1080,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1490905164352,"time":1490905164,"md5":"eA9lw8Erlcac2BVw3C5KwA==","fsize":2034212,"resto":0,"id":"Gf\/yLc59","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"at-this-point-im-convinced-another-pol-harbor","country_name":"United States","replies":17,"images":5,"unique_ips":14},{"no":118963212,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)16:23:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118962680\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118962680<\/a><br>Next level shilling OP","filename":"3756735626245624","ext":".png","w":248,"h":255,"tn_w":121,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490905430216,"time":1490905430,"md5":"WQ+P7W5xkwiBQKY8lrmaVA==","fsize":85709,"resto":118962680,"id":"KbkBCO+E","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118963454,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)16:25:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118962680\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118962680<\/a><br>so called &quot;shill&quot; here.

Are you guys really staying here just so you can redpill normies? You shouldn&#039;t do that until your beliefs are resolute and argumentative skills are razor sharp. Most of us here only have a vague understanding of the crazy shit going on in the world. We&#039;re spending too much time debating this disgustingly petty bullshit when we should be working together to unearth the actual truth. Remember the collaboration during the Podesta email leaks? The pizza gate investigation? Capturing Shia&#039;s flag? To some, even Trump&#039;s election as president? We&#039;ve shown that we can accomplish great things when working together. It&#039;s very difficult to do that as of now. The shills are adapting and the red pills are harder to swallow due to growing and highly publicized right wing opposition. <br><br>Regardless if Trump&#039;s support is down or not, it certainly seems like it and I&#039;m seeing a lot of people spitting out their pills. We&#039;re weak because we&#039;re not united. We need a safe space free of shilling.","time":1490908283,"resto":118962680,"id":"EIilY6Lb","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118969629,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)17:13:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118969322\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118969322<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;inb4 shill<\/span><br><br>This picture was taken at the inauguration","filename":"image","ext":".jpg","w":4032,"h":3024,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1490908422805,"time":1490908422,"md5":"LTO01pnRDRChvi5bLFWbJw==","fsize":1176031,"resto":118962680,"id":"EIilY6Lb","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"}]}

These news articles could be one sided, out of context, fabricated entirely, or purposefully misleading. These articles often end up being used by Congress in hearings to support their arguments and influence their decisions. <br><br>2) People have an informal hierarchy of news sources they are willing to trust over others. This is similar to the weight of authority given to judicial opinions, a Supreme Court opinion is going to have the more weight than a Federal trial court opinion. Likewise, people do not trust blatantly partisan sources like shareblue or breitbart and they do not trust sources whose name they have never heard of. However, there is no agreed upon Supreme Court of news sources. <br><br>3) We have an adversarial press just like adversarial court system where each side argues on the same set of facts. In a court of law, each side spins their facts favorable for their clients. Sometimes facts are contradictory on both sides and the court must decide which one is correct.","filename":"court","ext":".jpg","w":400,"h":361,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":225,"tim":1491345028783,"time":1491345028,"md5":"1QUq966wc6YrrbUFAar9BA==","fsize":39831,"resto":0,"id":"68eIMFb7","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"do-we-need-a-court-of-public-opinion","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

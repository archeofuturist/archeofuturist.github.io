The idea that there must exist an authoritarian government to keep men out of a state of nature falls apart with the function of time. If man was left alone in the state of nature long enough, a barbarian tribe would amass a monopoly of violence and conquer another effectively creating an autocracy. I see no difference from the authoritarian government Hobbes called for in his social contract theory and the barbarian conquerors in the state of nature.

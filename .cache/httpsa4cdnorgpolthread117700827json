The idea that there must exist an authoritarian government to keep men out of a state of nature falls apart with the function of time. If man was left alone in the state of nature long enough, a barbarian tribe would amass a monopoly of violence and conquer another effectively creating an autocracy. I see no difference from the authoritarian government Hobbes called for in his social contract theory and the barbarian conquerors in the state of nature. The only true &quot;society&quot; or &quot;civilization&quot; is a voluntary one; a voluntary association of non-aggressors.","filename":"1489072707081","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":527,"tn_w":118,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490147237159,"time":1490147237,"md5":"axKQbYyYctQ583qK5uKrnA==","fsize":57383,"resto":117700827,"id":"C9ob6z5U","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117702441,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)21:48:31","name":"Anonymous","filename":"1470698508846","ext":".jpg","w":297,"h":400,"tn_w":92,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490147311753,"time":1490147311,"md5":"J9\/UXyC7g2XinnYc8GbeLQ==","fsize":39610,"resto":117700827,"id":"k0F3AsmU","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117702807,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)21:52:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117700827\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117700827<\/a><br>Yes","filename":"IMG_2927","ext":".jpg","w":870,"h":600,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":86,"tim":1490147535162,"time":1490147535,"md5":"1s+Wbf0LOH6xkRUsLU8RjQ==","fsize":35047,"resto":117700827,"id":"mnxPoxgA","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117703386,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)21:57:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117700827\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117700827<\/a><br>if you use the roads you gotta pay for them faggett","time":1490147841,"resto":117700827,"id":"js3zdbIU","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117703664,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)21:59:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"I&#039;m fine with tax I get that it helps with a lot in society.

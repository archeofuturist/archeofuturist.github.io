The Velvet Expansion of the 1990s to the Post-Soviet Vacuum gave way to the Iron Fist for which the 9\/11 terror strikes provided the excuse, and which meant invading whichever country Washington desired; however, the Iron Fist efforts in the post-9\/11 world demonstrated the West&#039;s weakness as sustaining operations in Iraq and Afghanistan proved too much for NATO. This failure ushered in the post-post-9\/11 world, and the Arab Spring became the first (though far from the only) demonstration of the evolved Western strategy which fuses the early approaches. Development aspect is still there. Western entities claim they are promoting Universal Human Values which evidently is &quot;the end which justifies all means&quot; and which automatically means it is impossible to commit war crimes in its pursuit. Also, by implication, anyone who stands in the West&#039;s way operates in the presumption of guilt.","time":1491574719,"resto":119950870,"id":"+D43pjm+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119954717,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)10:19:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119954647\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119954647<\/a><br>In order to promote said Universal Values, the West identifies, creates or even invents a political movement, which although it consists mostly of corrupt opportunists and outright criminals, ostensibly stands for universal values. This entity then receives overwhelmingly positive media coverage to the point of referring to any police or military response to the violence it perpetrates as war crimes in order to shape public opinion in favor of limited military intervention in the form of air strikes and a small number of Special Operations troops. Then, one really needs an excuse--a small incident, an insignificant act of violence by the target country&#039;s law enforcement, the kind that happens in the United States on a daily basis--in order to start beating the war drums against the blood-soaked regime. This approach was pioneered in Bosnia and Kosovo--the early exceptions to the Velvet policy, but was then shelved in the post-9\/11 era, and it seemed that West aims could be achieved by more direct and brutal means, only to be resurrected by the Obama Administration, and applied in Libya, Syria, and Ukraine with only minor variations.","time":1491574749,"resto":119950870,"id":"+D43pjm+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119954734,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)10:19:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"The globalists are taking cities in a line from idlib on the Mediterranean east to Mosul(iraq) along the Euphrates, perhaps all the way to where it meets the Tigris.

It is also evident that Western powers are in an informal, very close alliance with the highly repressive governments of the Gulf Arab states, which also stood to gain from eliminating the political competition posed by Libya&#039;s government and from building pipelines to Europe over the course of the Syrian state. This alignment was made necessary by the West&#039;s need of boots on the ground which can accomplish that with air power alone cannot with ISIS and mushroom-free Syrian Army and other such formations, being a NATO-trained and NATO-approved force, which can be sent when NATO soldiers can&#039;t go, due to the domestic opposition. Such a move would provoke the insights into the finances of the various Clinton Foundations provided by WikiLeaks clearly show the inner workings of this alliance. The leaks also illustrate the key aspect of this alliance, namely the secretive and conspiratorial imaginations of a small group of influential actors, as opposed to the broader league consensus that existed during the Cold War; nevertheless, this small group of conspirators on 3 continents now amounts to a de factor Washington-Brussels-Riyadh axis.","time":1491574784,"resto":119950870,"id":"+D43pjm+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119954822,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)10:19:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119954383\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119954383<\/a><br>You faggots are mentally ill.

Bush Administration. Saudi Arabia was aghast at the idea of toppling the Sunni rule in Iraq, and the EU was mostly opposed to invading Iraq, which made the EU&#039;s embrace of regime change in Syria, Libya, and Ukraine all the more startling; though, not entirely surprising. Just as the US foreign policies are driven by the fear of being eclipsed by rising or recovering powers like China, Russia, Iran, the 2008 crisis aired the EU&#039;s weakness and that has provided an incentive the EU hardliners engage in reckless policies in the hopes of staving off its collapse. Is the game worth the candle, considering the shrillness at the pro-war propaganda in both the US and the EU today to the point of risking WW3? The imagined benefits of regime changes must have been enormous. Stamping out the last truly sovereign states would have strengthened the West&#039;s claim of global hegemony. The failures in the Ukraine, and in Syria and ultimately also Libya therefore place Western powers face-to-face with the prospect of historic decline.","time":1491574815,"resto":119950870,"id":"+D43pjm+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119954928,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)10:20:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119954822\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119954822<\/a><br>He is getting to you<br><br>just listen to Him","filename":"1474436269865","ext":".png","w":390,"h":390,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491574822050,"time":1491574822,"md5":"k+a3DfWwmElLNj\/i0i3ivw==","fsize":19446,"resto":119950870,"id":"TMMJGfs6","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119954949,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)10:20:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119954647\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119954647<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The end of history<\/span>","filename":"1379007130995","ext":".png","w":214,"h":226,"tn_w":118,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491574831735,"time":1491574831,"md5":"cKFJJZLb+Y1mRb2X4LMqBw==","fsize":88310,"resto":119950870,"id":"7RJd9b0c","country":"AR","country_name":"Argentina"},{"no":119954956,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)10:20:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119954526\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119954526<\/a><br>yea what a fucking cuckold, fucking Trump too dumb to figure out what is going on in Syria.<br><br>meanwhile every non brain dead human figured it out in less than 3 google searches.","filename":"1487085788682","ext":".jpg","w":399,"h":400,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491574835249,"time":1491574835,"md5":"i1b\/r8CUeSPg1xo7Hxqytg==","fsize":23478,"resto":119950870,"id":"JEFUqpLL","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":119955187,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)10:21:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119954119\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119954119<\/a><br>Lol that&#039;s all you got?

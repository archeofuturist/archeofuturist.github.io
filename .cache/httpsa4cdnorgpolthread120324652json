The doctors found that the videos were counterfeit, where even Arabic stage directions were overheard, and that the alleged \u201cRescue\u201d in actuality is a murder. On first analysis, it looked as though the doctors working on the child assumed he was already dead.<br>However, after broader investigation, our team ascertained that the boy was unconscious from an overdose of opiates. The video shows the child receiving injections in his chest, perhaps in the area of the heart and was eventually killed while a clearly fake adrenaline injection was administered.<br>This was a murder.<br>The doctors determined in its analysis:<br>\u2022 The video should be life-saving measures after a chemical attack with chlorine gas (now claimed to be Sarin-not possible), including injection of adrenaline via syringe with a long needle into the heart of an infant. In no way were treatments correctly given for any potential chemical agent.<br>\u2022 The handling and treatment of the child was done in a manner that was careless, dangerous and likely to cause serious harm.<br>\u2022 Most telling is the fake repeated shots of adrenalin, supposedly into the heart. The medical personnel, and I think we can safely call them actors at this point, failed to push the plunger on the needle. Thus, the contents of the syringe were never injected as is clearly visible in the video itself.<br>\u2022 The visible diagnosis by a team of actual medical experts, based on what is observed in the video, indicates that the child was suffering from an injection of opiates and was likely dying of an overdose. There is no evidence of any other agent, chemical or otherwise.","filename":"untitled","ext":".png","w":267,"h":200,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1491766756240,"time":1491766756,"md5":"\/e2uAscfi\/a4aZnnS3QNhg==","fsize":62332,"resto":0,"id":"BBWTEzeT","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"gas-attacks-fake","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":2,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":120324727,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)15:39:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"\u2022 None of the children in the videos showed any sign of being a victim of a chemical attack.

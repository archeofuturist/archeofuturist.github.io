I figured the best place to ask was pol. The prompt or the question for the essay is &quot;Throughout the ages, we have questioned the ability for mankind to find peace. What does it take to create peace? what stands in the way of peace? Is Peace Possible?&quot; (Peace not only in the middle east, but as a global concept as well)<br>I would like some input from others on how to approach this essay, specifically, how would you tackle a thesis for this?<br><br>I have an angle talking about fear being a large contributor to not only the Middle east conflict over Israel, but over war in general throughout history, and that fear is the main problem in obtaining peace. But I am struggling to further expand on this point.<br><br>I will admit I am not well versed in this area, so any help would be appreciated.","filename":"maxresdefault[1]","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":720,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1490065813161,"time":1490065813,"md5":"NqQ8ZzLEb23xx4e0oU5xew==","fsize":172793,"resto":0,"id":"COPT1pPh","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"palestinianisraeli-conflict-essay","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

They need to live within structures of simplification because that&#039;s how they protect themselves from the terrible onslaught of complexity.<br><br>But by the same token, we organize ourselves into these structures of simplification, that&#039;s what our cultures are. We negotiate them, we inhabit them jointly.<br><br>Because of that, when we run into people who do that differently, the probability that we&#039;ll engage in conflict is extraordinarily high, because, I can&#039;t give up my beliefs just because you have different beliefs, and if we don&#039;t have the same beliefs, then we can&#039;t peacefully occupy the same territory. So there seems to be nothing for that except conflict. If we can&#039;t negotiate, then we have to fight.<br><br>We can&#039;t abandon our belief systems because they structure our realities and protect us. And we can&#039;t fight, because now we&#039;re so technologically powerful that if we do, we&#039;re gonna destroy everything.&quot;<br><br>So, I was posting on \/mu\/ earlier and I wanted to make a point by comparing:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;the pressure artists have to respect the genre they&#039;ve been tagged as or the expectation fan-bases exerts on them to follow the same musical lines of their previous work&quot; vs. &quot;enjoying singles and appreciating an artist&#039;s work for a single he has released&quot;<\/span><br>to <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;racism classification and oppression&quot; vs. &quot;individualism and valorization of the individual&quot;<\/span><br><br>but then, I thought about what Peter said and refrained myself from posting it.<br><br>Why?<br><br>Because boards are structures of simplification and each of them has their own rules, culture and beliefs.<br><br>Of course, one board 4 them all would be way too chaotic. So 4chan&#039;s territory has been split into several subjects\/themes called boards.<br><br>So what happens when OP&#039;s post has nothing to do with the board&#039;s (country) subject\/theme (culture) or the community&#039;s beliefs)? OP gets persecuted.","filename":"1490153019422","ext":".jpg","w":684,"h":912,"tn_w":187,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490509258297,"time":1490509258,"md5":"zdQBR1z9QJy4dnAyeEpFnw==","fsize":113838,"resto":0,"id":"7cMNNum0","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"lets-go-meta-philosophy","country_name":"Canada","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

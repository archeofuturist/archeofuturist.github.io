He got a gf and school ended, at which point he essentially cut contact with me (and everyone else from school). For at least the year after that it was kind of a withdrawal period, I was still thinking about him a lot and didn&#039;t care about making any new friends at uni. I&#039;ve got a close friend again now and I&#039;m consciously aware of not being too clingy (ie not trying to message him every day or be a part of everything in his life) Not entirely sure how relevant that is but I feel like that ordeal defined me a bit regarding how much value I put on requiring other people. Perhaps it&#039;s related.","time":1492923643,"resto":122353511,"id":"ymY9I\/Ng","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"}]}

His plans were unsustainable, even if he wasn&#039;t dying of a terminal illness. He had no successors and his civilization was carefully designed to never produce any. He arbitrarily denied himself the extra manpower women provided and kept them in nigh-useless roles because his soldiers were too stupid to behave unless Caesar let them go on believing they were worthless, to the point of nearly sabotaging his negotiations with a female Courier. <br><br>He never domesticated the tribals, only tamed them. Without him they will break apart and his empire will crumble.

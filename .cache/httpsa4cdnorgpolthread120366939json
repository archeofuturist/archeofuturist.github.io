It sounds insane:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Housing Costs Are Pushing People Further Out of Sydney<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Akhilesh Mehta flops into his bus seat and readies himself for the hour-and-a-half commute from his job in central Sydney to his home on the city\u2019s outskirts. As the bus crawls through bumper-to-bumper traffic, the 48-year-old accountant says he puts up with the journey for a simple reason: when it came to buying a family home, the city\u2019s fringes were \u201cthe only place I could afford.\u201d<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;New South Wales has taken over as Australia\u2019s economic engine as the mining investment boom tails off, with central Sydney contributing almost a quarter of the nation\u2019s growth last fiscal year. That success has come with a price. As workers flock to Sydney, an under-supply of housing, coupled with record-low interest rates, has made the city the world\u2019s second-most expensive property market. Home prices jumped 19 percent in the past 12 months, stoking concern home ownership is increasingly beyond the reach of younger people. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Sydney\u2019s growing pains are evident in commutes that now rival New York and London.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The nation is also luring increasing numbers of global millionaires, helping make it one of the fastest growing wealthy nations in the world...<\/span><br><br>https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/arti<wbr>cles\/2017-04-09\/sydney-s-price-of-s<wbr>uccess-sky-high-housing-costs-long-<wbr>commutes","filename":"-1x-1[1]","ext":".png","w":1200,"h":800,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1491785778418,"time":1491785778,"md5":"McqA6qM+5MtfE5RNl3I9hw==","fsize":38551,"resto":0,"id":"Oy3bAdPe","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"sydney-housing-market-continues-to-heat-up","country_name":"United States","replies":6,"images":1,"unique_ips":2},{"no":120367203,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)20:58:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120366939\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120366939<\/a><br>average auckland house prices now are 1.1 million NZD","time":1491785908,"resto":120366939,"id":"z66OHwtW","country":"NZ","country_name":"New Zealand"},{"no":120367280,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)20:59:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120366939\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120366939<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;There are several barriers to boosting housing supply in Sydney. The city is bordered by mountains to the west, the ocean to the east and rivers and national parks to the north and south, restricting the supply of new land, while moves to increase housing density in established suburbs have run into opposition from residents.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;That\u2019s meant in the past three years, almost 70 percent of new detached houses have been built more than 30 kilometers (19 miles) from Sydney\u2019s central business district...<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Even those houses don\u2019t come cheap. In Rouse Hill, near where Mehta lives, prices in the new housing estates that dot the once semi-rural area have surged 63 percent since 2012, including a 7.8 percent increase in the 12 months through February, according to data provider CoreLogic Inc.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u201cTo pay these mortgages, you need to be earning A$120,000 minimum.

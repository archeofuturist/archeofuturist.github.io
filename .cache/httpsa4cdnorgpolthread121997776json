In practice, I know this infringement would be applied to all sorts of other disqualifying factors. So I think the second amendment should stand as written - and the rights of the people to own guns should not be infringed upon. Even if more people would commit suicide as a result.

While we still have hobbyists, and we aren&#039;t as crazy as the UK, owning a gun for self defense is not allowed.

The state lays claim to a &quot;monopoly of violence&quot;. Hence, we should all trust the state to protect us, and as such it&#039;s logical that we are not able to protect ourselves. And as with any system that is only judged by itself, it&#039;s completely unworkable. Police are understaffed, underpaid, overregulated, and filled with imbeciles and playground fascists. Crime response is laughable, and while they proudly boast with dropping crime rates, there is every indication of their refusal to actually deal with crime is a significant contributor to people not even reporting it anymore.

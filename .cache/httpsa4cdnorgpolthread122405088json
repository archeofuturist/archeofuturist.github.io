Also, mutations are just about always detrimental to the organism that has it without a single beneficial mutation being observed in higher (multicellular) life forms. Natural selection does play a role in certain fine tuning of species particularly in areas such as disease resistance but evidence has not shown it to produce a new species in even the most simple life forms that produce thousands of generations a month. Evolution certainly exists but the mechanism of how new species are created is as yet unknown.... only thing known for sure is that they aren&#039;t created by natural selection and the big man in the sky didn&#039;t make them all in 7 days.

One missile is worthless, agreed. However if you were to use multiple missiles to attack a ufo with a laser defense the technique would be to use a nuclear detonation as a shield against further interceptions via laser.<br><br>remember that plasma is an excellent insulator because the amount of free electrons able to absorb EM radiation of any wavelength is immense. A nuclear fireball is effectively impenetrable to laser fire for a few brief seconds. If you were to daisy chain detonations to the target you could intercept a ufo in low earth orbit. Remember also that nuclear weapons were designed to survive nearby blasts, this becomes feasible in my mind.","time":1492334467,"resto":121333083,"id":"2Ly94aYu","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]}

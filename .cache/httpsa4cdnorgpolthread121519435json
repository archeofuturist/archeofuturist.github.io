You&#039;re wrong, I&#039;m afraid. I&#039;d be quite willing to bet that most of you don&#039;t even really know what the Labour Theory of value (LTV) even really means, what it attempts to explain, or anything much about it at all. You just &quot;know it&#039;s been debunked&quot;. <br><br>I&#039;m gonna explain what the LTV actually is, and explain how it has not, in fact, been proven to be wrong. <br><br>The original LTV was an idea of the classic economics; Ricardo, Smith, etc. Marx later adapted the theory, correcting some of their errors. <br><br>The idea in both formulations is essentially this: all value is created by labour. <br>Original LTV = the value of a thing is determined by the amount of labour gone into making it (e.g. it takes 10 hours to produce a table and 5 hours to produce a chair, so the table will be twice the value of the chair - regardless of price)<br>Marx\u2019s LTV = the value of a thing is determined by the amount of labour required to reproduce that item again today (so a table that originally took 10 hours to make, that could be made in 1 hour today, would have the same value as a table that takes 1 hour to make)<br><br>(continued...)","filename":"marx3","ext":".jpg","w":639,"h":910,"tn_w":175,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492431805265,"time":1492431805,"md5":"DruxOAHh2YeNu++YpLke6A==","fsize":383530,"resto":0,"id":"KgLKYIGm","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"ltv-explained","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":17,"images":4,"unique_ips":6},{"no":121519523,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)08:24:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121519435\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121519435<\/a><br><br>It is important to remember that Value is not the same thing as Price. Price is what you pay for a particular commodity. Price tends towards value, but it is not the same thing. Price is a numerical figure. Value on the other hand, is something relative to other commodities.<br>Example: the price of a can of coke varies. 60p, 90p, \u00a31.50, 120 Yen.<br>But it will almost always be less expensive than the price of a car - no matter how much that car is, \u00a3300 or \u00a330,000. <br>This is because the value of the car is greater than the value of the can of coke. <br>The value determines the \u201cprice range\u201d if you like. <br>Value is what we use to compare commodities. Commodities have proportional value to each other, and they will be sold at a price that tends towards their value. Individual instances of things having a price well above their real value bracket do not disprove this theory, as it attempts only to deal with general trends. So, the fact that a celebrity&#039;s tissue sells on eBay for hundreds of dollars, or something, can be treated as an anomaly. It is a price that doesn&#039;t tend towards value, for other explicable reasons. <br><br>So what gives things \u201cvalue\u201d? What makes the car more valuable than the can of coke? What makes a house more valuable than a spoon? What is value?<br><br>It must be the common factor amongst all commodities - it must be something that allows us to make this comparisson between commodities. How can I say that a table is worth twice as much as a chair, if there is no common feature about them? The measure of value has to be something that applies to all commodities. <br><br>(continued...)","filename":"marx2","ext":".jpg","w":815,"h":1024,"tn_w":99,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492431874822,"time":1492431874,"md5":"vCT77hmPZU3dDDpHi91N6w==","fsize":167046,"resto":121519435,"id":"KgLKYIGm","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121519739,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)08:27:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121519523\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121519523<\/a><br>What is the common social substance of all commodities? It is labour. To produce a commodity a certain amount of labour must combined with it. The entire process of creating a commodity can be reduced to human labour time. By combining human labour with other commodities, capitalists can add value to the commodity (e.g. turning steel into a car). Human labour time has gone into every commoditty, at some stage. The more human labour time that has gone into producing a commodity, the more expensive it will be. <br><br>This human labour time is reduced down into everything; every machine, every transport, every drop of fuel - all at the root of them all is human labour, first and foremost. If the machine you use to produce your commodity took x human labour hours to invent, and y human labour hours to build, and continues to take z human labour hours to maintain - that is the value of that machine. The value (and again, note, I do not mean price) of all your costs as a capitalist are reducible to human labour time. <br><br>Most criticisms of LTV crucially fail to understand that it does not attempt to determine prices, only values. Again, when it says &quot;value&quot;, it means exchange value specifically - Marx always acknowledged the concept of &quot;use-value&quot; as well, but he argued that while perceived use-value might have some sway on price, in general price tends more towards exchange-value than use-value. He fully agrees that use-value is subjective, prone to change based on fashion and circumstance. It is for those exact reasons that he thinks it cannot be a sufficient determining factor in price. It must be exchange-value that provides the greatest mass of gravity around which price fluctuates. Price is of course a far more nebulus concept, that Marx never claimed to be able to determine so precisely. He only recognised that there was a general trend towards which prices gravitated, and that this was rooted in exchange-value, a.k.a socially necessary labour time value.","filename":"young marx","ext":".jpg","w":220,"h":407,"tn_w":67,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492432025917,"time":1492432025,"md5":"ROecyk\/++rvWF95CoO0+Sg==","fsize":28731,"resto":121519435,"id":"KgLKYIGm","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121519907,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)08:28:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121519435\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121519435<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121519523\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121519523<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121519739\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121519739<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Non-empirical nonsense<\/span><br>Making shit up to justify value being some fabricated number instead of what you can sell a product for doesn&#039;t make it true.

If use-value is 0, then exchange value (that is, labour time) is irrelevant - the price will be 0. But for two items with each a use-value of 10, let&#039;s say (if we can put a number on it for this hypothetical) might have two wildly different prices; that difference is determined by labour-time.

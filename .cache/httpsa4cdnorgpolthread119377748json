The Gibraltar land formation was captured by ZAFT on May 25, CE 70 after the First Battle of Casablanca and soon after construction of the base started. From this base ZAFT attacked Europe and Africa. On July 24, CE 71 the base is attacked by the Earth Alliance and ZAFT is forced to leave the base and withdraw from Europe. However, after the signing of the Treaty of Junius, the base was returned to ZAFT as a permanent Earth base.","time":1491253305,"resto":119377748,"id":"6B5tCYt\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119379938,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)17:02:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"it&#039;s just the usual euro butthurt, not important","time":1491253328,"resto":119377748,"id":"7oo7+Gu2","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119380012,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)17:02:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119379769\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119379769<\/a><br>Fake news they have a massive hospital.

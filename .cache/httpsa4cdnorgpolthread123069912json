Hitler considered Edward to be friendly towards Nazi Germany and thought that Anglo-German relations could have been improved through Edward if it were not for the abdication. Albert Speer quoted Hitler directly: &quot;I am certain through him permanent friendly relations could have been achieved. If he had stayed, everything would have been different.

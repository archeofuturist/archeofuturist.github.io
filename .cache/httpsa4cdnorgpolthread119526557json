I do own a thor&#039;s hammer pendant, a set of tiny runes made out of onyx, and some other things, and I&#039;m building a small shrine \/ meditation area in a forest clearing near my house (i live up north), but that&#039;s about it. I don&#039;t believe any of it is magical, it just feels nice to have. Also i like viking aestetics.<br><br>Some think it&#039;s crappy because it&#039;s not the old style nordic paganism, but rather is based on that - the reason being that it was reconstructed from what we know of those times rather then passed down from father to son (or through an active &quot;church&quot;). I don&#039;t agree. I feel like it&#039;s a good thing. It&#039;s the old stuff but in a new package - fit for the 21st century. Also, the fact that it&#039;s based on old writings and archeological finds makes it more universal in a way, i.e. there&#039;s no problem for an american with northern european roots to be a practicioner, since they basically know just as much as we do about it.<br><br>Nothing against christianity btw. It did us a lot of good, just it has run its course in my country, and we need to go back to something solid and real. The stuff that kept people going through the hard life up here for thousands of years seems good enough to me. Also I rather like the mythology, rather then the christian\/jewish\/muslim stuff which - let&#039;s face it - was dreamt up by a bunch of niggers.<br><br>Anyone else think this is good, and part of the future for the white world? I kind of do. I also think it fits well into nationalism (i&#039;m on the &quot;folkish&quot; side, since that&#039;s what makes it genuine and thus give it its strength). Finally, it also doesn&#039;t have to be a bad thing for non whites\/nordics (no expansionist\/proselytizing stuff).","filename":"ef54960434000c0d88523f7843593f3a","ext":".jpg","w":450,"h":445,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":247,"tim":1491344914924,"time":1491344914,"md5":"bmAbt17rSSn9yh2PmaQ8OA==","fsize":42951,"resto":0,"id":"yDstJRE7","country":"SE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"who-here-nordic-paganism","country_name":"Sweden","replies":2,"images":1,"unique_ips":3},{"no":119526823,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)18:30:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119526557\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119526557<\/a><br>All paganism is basically the same gods and morals with different names.

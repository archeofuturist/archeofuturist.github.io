A substantial proportion of the twins were raised in families living near or below the poverty level. Biometric analyses were conducted using models allowing for components attributable to the additive effects of genotype, shared environment, and non-shared environment to interact with socioeconomic status (SES) measured as a continuous variable. Results demonstrate that the proportions of IQ variance attributable to genes and environment vary nonlinearly with SES. The models suggest that in impoverished families, 60% of the variance in IQ is accounted for by the shared environment, and the contribution of genes is close to zero; in affluent families, the result is almost exactly the reverse.<\/span>","time":1492647018,"resto":121900755,"id":"5xWT8FO1","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121920913,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)20:11:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121900755\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121900755<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;fell for science=good job meme<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;majored in a physical science<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;3 yrs, still have not earned over 12$ an hour wage<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;making more in stocks than wages<\/span><br><br>I&#039;m not sure how to feel about this.","time":1492647109,"resto":121900755,"id":"BM\/fIflf","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

Come and do this one day and you&#039;ll see that the soviet heritage still haunts us up to this day, at large part the fault is that all these boomers that are alive lived most of their lives in Soviet Union and old habits die hard they adopted during that time. Very view enterprising and intelligent boomers have managed to drop the old habits and learn new ones, like how to efficiently run a business or modernize their field of work.<br><br>Very simple example for start is that communism destroyed many people&#039;s ability to be creative, enterprising, ambitious, compassionate towards each other and other such values people in the west have that made them successful. Communism valued stealing from your job, &quot;pretending to work and the company pretending to pay&quot;, also rampant drinking on the clock, everything was obtained through &quot;connections&quot; not through honest competition, and in addition, communist countries were filled with KGB informants so you couldn&#039;t really trust anybody.<br><br>We have made a very huge jump from that time and developed ourselves a lot. Just compare baltics with Ukraine or Moldova, which are doing so much worse. Don&#039;t be unfair here, Hans.

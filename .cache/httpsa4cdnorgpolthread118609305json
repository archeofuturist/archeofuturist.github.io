This is for two reasons, I suspect. Firstly, police investigation methods have dramatically improved and now utilize sophisticated analytical techniques. Secondly, and I admit I have no proof of this, but I believe there were environmental factors that lead to the aberrant psychologies of serial killers. Many people have speculated that tetraethyl lead played a role in high crime rates from the 70&#039;s to the 90&#039;s, while I find this plausible, tetraethyl lead was hardly the worst environmental chemical in use. It is impossible to say definitively if there is any causal relation of environmental contaminants to crime prevalence in the past, but I think it is plausible at the very least.<br><br>Fortunately, thanks to more rigorous testing and better chemical knowledge, the worst chemicals in widespread use today are just going to cause gonadal atrophy and cancer, there is nothing in common use that is likely to cause psychological aberrations.","time":1490675182,"resto":118609305,"id":"MtI4Gagw","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118610348,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)00:26:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118609986\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118609986<\/a><br>I live in the same region and wtf are you talking about?

Some have been mentioned, but the general reasons are:<br><br>1. Forensics and criminal profiling of serial killers have become a mainstay of criminal investigations, meaning that it&#039;s much easier to crack cases. Also, through the internet and advances in telecommunications since the early 1980s, police departments are far more connected than beforehand. Which means police departments can pool resources to track patterns and information on suspects at the blink of an eye as opposed to the old days, where it could take days if not weeks for police departments to swap information. <br><br>2. Introduction of internet\/online porn\/mainstreaming of violent video games has created a generation of folk who can get all of their sick sexual and violence fetish needs met without breaking the law once. Defenders of internet porn often mention that it gives men an outlet so they can get off without having to stalk and kill women, while violent video games like Grand Theft Auto let people live out their serial killer fantasy on a TV screen, with no one getting hurt in real life.<br><br>3. Serial killers evolving in the age of media saturation of serial killers as entertainment. Basically the idea that if you are a serial killer, you watch the media and you get all sort of free lessons on what not to do. So serial killers stop leaving clues to the police, learn not to shit where they eat, and basically stay under the radar.","time":1490678511,"resto":118609305,"id":"zPxSF0Yg","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118615282,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)01:22:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118615109\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118615109<\/a><br>Quit shilling yourself proxy fag.","time":1490678524,"resto":118609305,"id":"NKfOG8QO","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118615319,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)01:22:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118609983\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118609983<\/a><br>That and also authorities tend to keep serial killers under wraps to prevent panic and remove a motivation from the killer.

I&#039;m not even being sarcastic. He&#039;s literally mentally ill though; not sure that would apply to a lot of serials out there. <br><br>They&#039;re usually just violent sociopaths with clustered personality disorders-- e.g. narcissistic personality disorder. In Ed&#039;s case, he was originally diagnosed with schizophrenia. Over time this has shifted to more of a severe dissociative disorder diagnosis--often seen in adult survivors of childhood abuse, which he is. <br><br>Like many serials, he was described as having an inadequate personality--&quot;passive aggressive&quot;, back when that was an official label. He lived in a solitary fantasy world and had severe inhibitions when it came to dealing with real people, especially women. Instead of developing normally socially and sexually, he was isolated and nurtured twisted paraphilias instead of healthy sexual fantasies.<br><br>When he was younger and less stable, he had a huge propensity for psychotic breaks, though he himself would attempt to deny that he had lost touch with reality. Those who saw his fits know better.<br><br>Some believe he is sociopathic, yet he has repeatedly exhibited a capacity for empathy during his years in prison. I wish he had not stopped doing interviews in the mid-1990s. According to those who work with him, going over his crimes had begun to upset him so much that he could no longer bear to do it. When faced with an interviewer asking the same old questions he would want to please them, give them what he felt they wanted. But then afterwards he would fall apart. So he withdrew permanently.<br><br>My guess would be he&#039;s on the spectrum, probably Asperger&#039;s. This is something I haven&#039;t seen much discussed, but he has all the earmarks of an aspie. Not really a bad person per se, but potentially extremely dangerous when removed from his safe zone--which is imprisonment, basically. He knows this and has refused parole hearings for years now.","filename":"ed kemper i killed her","ext":".gif","w":160,"h":225,"tn_w":88,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490678712459,"time":1490678712,"md5":"vJ\/qRpoGuxodQgsr3gnGdQ==","fsize":246298,"resto":118609305,"id":"G8aQ4R94","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118615571,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)01:25:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118615091\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118615091<\/a><br>Thanks, anon.

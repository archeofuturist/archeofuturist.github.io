This is for two reasons, I suspect. Firstly, police investigation methods have dramatically improved and now utilize sophisticated analytical techniques. Secondly, and I admit I have no proof of this, but I believe there were environmental factors that lead to the aberrant psychologies of serial killers. Many people have speculated that tetraethyl lead played a role in high crime rates from the 70&#039;s to the 90&#039;s, while I find this plausible, tetraethyl lead was hardly the worst environmental chemical in use. It is impossible to say definitively if there is any causal relation of environmental contaminants to crime prevalence in the past, but I think it is plausible at the very least.<br><br>Fortunately, thanks to more rigorous testing and better chemical knowledge, the worst chemicals in widespread use today are just going to cause gonadal atrophy and cancer, there is nothing in common use that is likely to cause psychological aberrations.","time":1490675182,"resto":118609305,"id":"MtI4Gagw","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118610348,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)00:26:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118609986\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118609986<\/a><br>I live in the same region and wtf are you talking about?

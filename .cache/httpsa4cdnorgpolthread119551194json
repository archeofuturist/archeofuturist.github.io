Late in January, the White House declared Trump would enforce an Obama administration order barring companies that do federal work from workplace discrimination on the basis of sexual identity. But in February, it revoked guidance on transgender students&#039; use of public school bathrooms, deferring to states.<br><br>The case stems from a lawsuit by Indiana teacher Kimberly Hively alleging that the Ivy Tech Community College in South Bend didn&#039;t hire her full time because she is a lesbian.<br><br>Hively said she agreed to bring the case because she felt she was being &quot;bullied.&quot;<br><br>She told The Associated Press in a telephone interview that the time has come &quot;to stop punishing people for being gay, being lesbian, being transgender.&quot;<br><br>The Chicago ruling followed a so-called en banc hearing of all the judges in the appeals court, with eight agreeing that the civil rights law prohibits discrimination because of sexual orientation, and three dissenting. The vote is notable because the 7th Circuit is considered a relatively conservative appeals court. Eight out of the 11 judges were appointed by Republican presidents.","filename":"rainbowpepe","ext":".jpg","w":400,"h":247,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":154,"tim":1491357901691,"time":1491357901,"md5":"DdEQhLbvrIQEyv+uvM68sg==","fsize":11622,"resto":0,"id":"4fCNVKCG","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"federal-court-lgbt-employees-protected-from","country_name":"United States","replies":10,"images":3,"unique_ips":9},{"no":119551401,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)22:06:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119551194\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119551194<\/a><br>There is literally nothing wrong with being gay.","filename":"1488830465921","ext":".jpg","w":400,"h":492,"tn_w":101,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491358015410,"time":1491358015,"md5":"LrhQkNu70XT8VXPyN+gNnQ==","fsize":69567,"resto":119551194,"id":"wcPVumkJ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119552020,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)22:12:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119551194\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119551194<\/a><br>You know all this judicial activism by the left is going to blow the fuck up in their face by forcing the issues to the Supreme Court right?

Even those that have some political undertones are typically more focused on decency than asserting a particular viewpoint. Take the recent Heineken commercial. It took people with opposing viewpoints and had them work together to solve a problem and bond over the work. And then it invited them to have a beer and discusses their differences in a very understanding and nonagressive way.<br>Then there is the Budweiser commercial that came out a few months ago. The commercial was focused on the founder of the company and how he traveled from Germany to the States in order to found his company. While there are nativists that tell him to go back home and leave he persists through the struggle and becomes a successful business man and never once does he act in an indecent man or to his aggressors. The commercial says a lot about the common struggle to succeed and I believe it is very well made with an excellent tone.<br>Now we come to the shit stain that is the recent Pepsi commercial. Literally had no message besides &quot;rebel&quot; and presented it in a way that is reminiscent of the recent ANTIFA and BLM protests that are typically and often are full of violent protesting and vandalism. To top it off they ad a pop culture icon and some weird sexual tension with an Asian guy to really hit all the most common denominators they could. The message was literally just &quot;Drink Pepsi because it&#039;s associated with this thing.&quot; Instead of making something with actual taste.<br><br>My conclusion is that beer commercials are superior.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;SOURCES<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/HtBZvl7dIu4<br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/8wYXw4K0A3g<br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/73P9STckPLw","filename":"IMG_1805","ext":".jpg","w":592,"h":572,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":241,"tim":1493454614343,"time":1493454614,"md5":"+ecAN3CavlgAXcCBZa93hg==","fsize":56537,"resto":0,"id":"kTejqysc","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"beer-commercials","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":123313533,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)04:32:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"Fuck off Shariablue.

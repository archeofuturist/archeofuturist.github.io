His numbers are tanking, he can&#039;t fulfill any of his promises, buttercup. Also Israel would gladly see it&#039;s biggest threat in the region removed, that would certainly make his lovely daughter Ivanka happy! I&#039;m sure you remember Tillerson and Halley already said Assad will go away soon, what do you think it means, teddy bear? We must save all those beautiful children from that butcher Assad, also Spicer called him today literaly worse than Hitler, can you imagine that, honey pie? Invasion will happen soon, there is no doubt about it, no matter what the cultists from the_dildo will try to sell you. Also my little treasure, let go of Trump, he betrayed you, hush it&#039;s ok to admit you trusted a conman.

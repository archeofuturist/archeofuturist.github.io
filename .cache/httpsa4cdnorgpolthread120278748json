Propaganda? Sure. A lot of people want regime change in Syria and are pushing Trump to do that. It seems that he is resisting further action at this point and refocusing on ISIS. But what got me about this man&#039;s statement is that he doesn&#039;t want to go to Europe. (Note, CNN also interviewed this man and it backfired badly on their agenda, for obvious reasons.)<br><br>He doesn&#039;t want to be a refugee. He wants to live in his own country, to stay home. Listen as he BTFOs libs and Liz Warren pushing to bring them here. I never looked at this migrant crisis in Europe from the viewpoint of those who do not want to go, who don&#039;t want to be forced out of their own homeland. I do believe that many of these people feel the same loyalty and love for their own land that we do for ours.<br><br>We must push Trump to keep his promise and create those safe zones, NOW. Do whatever is needed vis-a-vis ISIS, Russia, and Assad himself to make that happen. For Europe&#039;s sake and for the actual Syrians who love their homeland.<br><br>&quot;SYRIANS WANT TO STAY IN SYRIA. WE DON&#039;T WANT TO BECOME REFUGEES. We didn&#039;t rebel and made all those sacrifices to become refugees, not in the States, not in Germany, not in Europe, not anywhere else! We want to stay in Syria where we belong, in the country we love.&quot;<br><br>Thoughts?<br><br>&quot;We&#039;ve been screaming for help for years while the Obama administration sat back and watched us getting slaughtered&quot;<br><br>&quot;500,000 people got killed, 12 million people got displaced and became refugees&quot;<br><br>&quot;President Trump...made the right decision&quot;<br><br>&quot;I felt happy, I felt grateful&quot;","filename":"kassem eid","ext":".jpg","w":480,"h":360,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1491742140777,"time":1491742140,"md5":"OP\/TUivgWtC237DEBZv74w==","fsize":21949,"resto":0,"id":"EwGuTudA","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"survivor-of-2013-gas-attacks-speaks-out-in","country_name":"United States","replies":8,"images":3,"unique_ips":7},{"no":120278914,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)08:51:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"(((syrian)))","time":1491742275,"resto":120278748,"id":"Yihffv1h","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120279032,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)08:52:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120278748\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120278748<\/a><br>pic related is you","filename":"031231","ext":".jpg","w":591,"h":572,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":120,"tim":1491742373307,"time":1491742373,"md5":"GesqH2NJ6t0JGso8iHf+Wg==","fsize":107342,"resto":120278748,"id":"Y2l6M4qC","country":"HU","country_name":"Hungary"},{"no":120279620,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)08:59:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"Hmmm sounds like (((shills))) want all those refugees flooding into our countries.

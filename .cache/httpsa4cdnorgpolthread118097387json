He&#039;s having lunch with Theresa May when he asks her, &quot;How do you know you&#039;ve got smart people?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I ask them a question only an intelligent person could answer.&quot; She replies. &quot;Watch, I&#039;ll show you.&quot; So she calls David Cameron and says to him, &quot;David, I&#039;ve got a question for you. If your father has a child and your mother has a child, and that child is not your brother or sister, who is that child?&quot;, to which David replied, &quot;Well, it must be me.&quot;<br><br>&quot;That&#039;s quite right, David. Thank you.&quot; She hangs up, and looks expectedly at Trump. He nods his head, clearly impressed. <br><br>A few days later, Trump returns to White House. Immediately he seeks out Mike Pence and asks him the question. Mike hems and haws, and finally tells Donald, &quot;Give me 10 minutes and I&#039;ll have an answer.&quot; Donald agrees, so Mike runs into another room and calls up Rex Tillerson. He says, &quot;Rex, you&#039;ve gotta help me figure out the answer to this riddle. If your father has a child and your mother has a child, and that child isn&#039;t your brother or sister, who is that child?&quot;. Rex is silent a moment, then says, &quot;It&#039;s me, of course.&quot;<br><br>Pence runs back to Donald excitedly and exclaims, &quot;I know the answer, Donald! The child is Rex Tillerson!&quot;<br><br>Donald scoffs and says &quot;No, dumbass, it&#039;s David Cameron!&quot;","filename":"image","ext":".jpg","w":594,"h":777,"tn_w":191,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490372767144,"time":1490372767,"md5":"BBsr\/BK1L5yQKJfbsuTHcA==","fsize":72891,"resto":0,"id":"8uGU7aA\/","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"so-donald-trump-is-visiting-the-uk-hes-having","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":118097524,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)12:27:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118097387\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118097387<\/a><br>(((Trump))) is banned for UK they hate zionist dirtbags","time":1490372841,"resto":118097387,"id":"lUW2DLzI","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118097879,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)12:30:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"VERMONT RIVER ASTEROID","time":1490373027,"resto":118097387,"id":"S2tGdXhG","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

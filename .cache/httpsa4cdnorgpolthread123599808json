A hiker brutally murdered, then thrown off a cliff in a remote mountain range. A devious killer who hid his wife\u2019s body under a thick cement patio. For investigators, the story is often the same: they know a murder took place, they may even know who did it. But without key evidence, pursuing a conviction is nearly impossible. That\u2019s when they call NecroSearch International. Necrosearch boasts a brain trust of the nation\u2019s top scientists, specialists, and behaviourists who use the latest technology and techniques to help solve \u201cunsolvable\u201d crimes, no matter how decayed the corpse, no matter how cleverly the killer has hidden the victim\u2019s body. Now, for the first time ever, readers are taken on a fascinating, often-shocking journey into a realm of crime investigation of which few people are aware. Necrosearch\u2019s most challenging cases are described, step-by-step, as these modern-day Sherlock Holmes\u2019s detect bodies and evidence thought irretrievable, and testify in court to bring cold-blooded killers to justice.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u201cFind the body and prove we killed her.\u201d \u2013 Gerry McCann.<\/span>","filename":"tmp_28866-5081621_Kate-Gerry-McCann-NEWS-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bquhm-8k55P1cg4FdiiMqgFmLvJF5WfpqnBZShRL_tOZw-1992150924","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":799,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":78,"tim":1493634294724,"time":1493634294,"md5":"yLZlWXhoWiy4XDjqDNiIrw==","fsize":63407,"resto":123599808,"id":"EAhQiQti","country":"GB","m_img":1,"country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123604537,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)06:25:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123604418\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123604418<\/a><br>Legitimately no idea what that is.<br><a href=\"#p123604414\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123604414<\/a><br>Greece brought austerity on itself desu by fudging its figures in the first place.","time":1493634303,"resto":123599808,"id":"wHKFka1E","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123604546,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)06:25:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123604178\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123604178<\/a><br>I must be missing something a graph about the US and a link about the EU.

In the UK, the white British population is about 55 million. If current trends continue, whites are projected to be a minority by 2060 when the population would be 80 million. Can you do the maths? That means 40 million white British, a collapse of over 25% in less that a half century. The situation in Germany, Sweden, France, and the rest of the Anglosphere is worse. As the ethnic population increases in proportion to the native, so will race mixing. Our political power as an ethnic group will decrease though, meanwhile our &quot;minorities&quot; will have entire ethnic national homelands lobbying for their interests against us, just like Israel does for the Jews. How do you feel about the future of our race if we are losing a quarter of our population every 50 years? Look at native Americans if you want to see our future.

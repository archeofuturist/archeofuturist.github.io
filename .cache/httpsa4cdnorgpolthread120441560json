I usually pussy out of these arguments and agree to disagree but I thought nah fuck it I&#039;m gonna win this one. Told him all about how the EC stops big blue cities from swinging the presidency every single time and that liberals want to take away rights which are literally required for some people to earn a living in some states. We did both agree that this last election neither candidate campaigned in solid states and only went for swing states. This clearly backfired on Hillary.","time":1491834555,"resto":120441560,"id":"9dLnqq4j","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"}]}

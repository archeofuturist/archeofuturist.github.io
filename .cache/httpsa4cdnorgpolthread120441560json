I used to be a far left communist and my views slowly changed. I think it was that the core\/root of my ideology was in error. All the other conclusions I was making were logical it was my premises that were wrong. When the fundamental premises were irredeemably challenge I was forced to change my opinion. I think you can change someones opinion but there is almost no chance it will happen instantaneously. It requires weeks of thought, sometimes months or even years of review. Most people just don&#039;t think at all and are lazy and just adhere to socially acceptable views these people will never change their opinions because they have none to begin with they are just appropriating. At best you might be able to take them from not thinking at all to thinking, which is unlikely because they simply do not actually care about the subject just the status points they get for holding socially acceptable views.","time":1491845885,"resto":120441560,"id":"7rP+6CBa","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120462891,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)13:40:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120446029\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120446029<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;fallacious<\/span><br><br>do me a fellatio please you fucking faggot","time":1491846007,"resto":120441560,"id":"IsLePyye","country":"RS","country_name":"Serbia"},{"no":120462990,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)13:40:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120459872\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120459872<\/a><br>Captcha","time":1491846044,"resto":120441560,"id":"5kfkB5Vs","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120463173,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)13:42:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120441747\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120441747<\/a><br><a href=\"#p120442001\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120442001<\/a><br>Fucking rekd and kekd","time":1491846126,"resto":120441560,"id":"YOINtBHt","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120463584,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)13:44:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120441560\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120441560<\/a><br>People&#039;s egos are preventing them from accepting somebody else&#039;s point of view because that would mean accepting own inferiority and submitting to your opponent.<br>Nobody does that unless they&#039;re absolutely 100% proven wrong and denying your opponent&#039;s point of view would just make you look retarded.<br>That&#039;s why i never try to argue openly with friends and if i want to convince them of something I just feed them bits of information here and there so they alter their point of view on their own and it doesn&#039;t look like I changed their minds","filename":"1469876619600","ext":".jpg","w":692,"h":960,"tn_w":90,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491846298504,"time":1491846298,"md5":"h3TtA2jmGkDrhlaSmE7R6Q==","fsize":211631,"resto":120441560,"id":"3BiLBuVU","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":120464127,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)13:49:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120463584\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120463584<\/a><br>The only exception would be if they consider you an authority already (like if you have a submissive girlfriend or a younger sibling or something) then you can probably just contradict their points of view and they will be likely to accept your version.

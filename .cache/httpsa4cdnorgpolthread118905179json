Do read up the rules of that agreement. Add to that removal of russian language and actions against anti-maidan protesters who didn&#039;t agree with unconstitutional actions of maidan and self stated nazies guarding parlament and you will notice a pattern that looked entirely too much like a staged coup not to be one. In such an envirompent extreme action is indeed warranted.

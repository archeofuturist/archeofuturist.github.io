I mean- it&#039;s the only source I&#039;m working with as far as geopolitics of Russia goes, so I haven&#039;t heard counter arguments, but it was at least interesting. Their case is that the central issue is that no geographical feature protects Moscow, so a buffer must be established, but then the only real agricultural region is in the south west and you can&#039;t efficiently support a big country, and at the same time it&#039;s a very multi ethnic country. Multi ethnic + barely enough food\/the ability to distribute -&gt; internal strife -&gt; Oprichniki -&gt; KGB.

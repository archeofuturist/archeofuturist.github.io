The biggest problem I face with national socialism is the problem of succession. How do you decide who leads the country next when most fascist states just dissolve after one leader?<br><br>You could try a vote but that&#039;s kind of stupid given the fascist state is very powerful and would more than likely just rig it. Doesn&#039;t really stop democracies either.<br><br>You could try more of a aristocrat republic sort of thing back when only wealthy land owners voted, but that&#039;s kind of just the same thing as rigging.<br><br>So I support a hereditary monarchy style of system. The reason for that being is so the leader actually has a reason to keep the country stable rather than going full despot. A king won&#039;t turn the country into horse shit by being a cunt because his son will inherent a country who will probably kill him. So there&#039;s a good incentive for a monarch to take things slow and steady.<br><br>Another benefit to that is there will almost never be a question or uncertainty of who&#039;s going to run the country. Every election cycle business and consumer confidence goes down because people are unsure on who&#039;s going to win. When people are fully aware of who&#039;s going to be in power next, there&#039;s nothing to worry about. Take Saudi for example, their king recently died and the prince took the seat instantly there wasn&#039;t any confusion with the people.<br><br>Having a monarchy also gives accountability. The leaders head is on the line if the people become unhappy. It&#039;s his decisions and everybody knows it rather than this ambiguous mass that is parliaments today it&#039;s just the two major parties throwing blame at each other for what the other did.","time":1492265674,"resto":121197974,"id":"9iNIdTdY","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":121214038,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)10:16:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121198582\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121198582<\/a><br><br>But Jews deserve the hate.","time":1492265817,"resto":121197974,"id":"iI2t15K2","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":121214119,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)10:18:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121198920\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121198920<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;4 years<\/span><br>Wow a true test of it&#039;s effectiveness then","time":1492265882,"resto":121197974,"id":"WB7Q96sx","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121214298,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)10:20:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121199024\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121199024<\/a><br>Do you think the nazis would have wanted to do anything with a dirty kebab?

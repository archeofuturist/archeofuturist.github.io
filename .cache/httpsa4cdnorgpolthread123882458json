I wanted to go to sleep now I have to reply to this bullshit thread. Fraternities. Red pilled? AHAHAHAHAHAAH. Wait.. you&#039;re serious? Are you a retard. Do you realize if you join a frat you&#039;re automatically so incredibly blue pilled. You&#039;re so pathetic that you need to pay for friends. The only reason people join frats is behind the Hollywood Jew programs high schoolers, both males and females into thinking that le crazy party lifestyle is so awesome. High schoolers try so hard to be popular in high school, and they join frats\/sorotities in college because they cannot deal with losing their status. That&#039;s why they have social media. They all have to show each other how much &quot;fun&quot; they&#039;re having. Meanwhile they&#039;re sucking each other&#039;s dongs at imitation rituals and spreading STDs like wildfires. Deep down being a slut wears down a girl mentally. And for guys they hate the idea of second questioning fraternities because they&#039;re afraid of rejection. <br><br>In conclusion, those that join frats and sorotities are actually the most insecure of the high schoolers. They need likes on Instagram and Facebook to feed their fragile egos. They&#039;re afraid of rejection for whatever reason. They&#039;re afraid of the real world, so they drink to pretend the real harsh reality doesn&#039;t exist. They&#039;re essentially the muggles of the spiritual world. You have to kind of feel bad for them though, as they&#039;re a direct result of Jewish propaganda. It&#039;s no surprise drinking and sex is featured in Hollywood.","time":1493794812,"resto":123882458,"id":"Kheav9\/P","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123884574,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)03:01:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123882458\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123882458<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Most US Presidents apart from Obongo were in a fraternity<\/span><br><br>he was in a fraternity","time":1493794874,"resto":123882458,"id":"Hgcb9Q3R","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":123884603,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)03:01:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123884509\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123884509<\/a><br>t.

I joined because I genuinely liked the guys and felt a true brotherly bond with them, and felt like it was a place I could help grow and could also help me become a better person through upholding our fraternity values.

What is the current situation here? How long will it take to actually beat ISIS in those countries? Is there still any credible turf on which they could still developp even if we defeat them in Syria and Iraq? <br><br>Last time I really focused on the question was three years ago. <br>Back then, ISIS relied mostly on controlling big cities and strategic roads and checkpoints, but they didn&#039;t have the men to completely secure their territory. They were also still reliant on hit and run tactics with many bomb attacks and heavy casualties with last-ditch suicide attacks in defense of cities like Palmyra. <br>However, they had growing support, both financial and in terms of troops, from Western Europe and the Arab Peninsula. How are their numbers and how are they evolving? <br><br>Back then, I had predicted that they wouldn&#039;t last for more than a decade, probably 5 or 7 years. How far off was I?","filename":"1446496004176","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":768,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1490950950965,"time":1490950950,"md5":"MtgLH\/sU7Zk00LtJpJlvUw==","fsize":355185,"resto":0,"id":"ZEirgicz","country":"BE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"war-in-syria-and-iraq-future-of-isisdaesh","country_name":"Belgium","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

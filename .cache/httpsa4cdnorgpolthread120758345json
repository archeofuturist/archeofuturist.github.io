Atheism is in decline worldwide, with the number of atheists falling from 4.5% of the world&#039;s population in 1970 to 2.0% in 2010 and projected to drop to 1.8% by 2020, <br><br>Real surveys and statistics say atheism is on the decline worldwide. Sorry atheists but atheism is not on the rise nor is it winning. It&#039;s still the minority and a declining one at that. <br><br>The Pew Research Center&#039;s statistics show that atheism is expected to continue to decline all the way into 2050 with a continued growth of religion. Other research also shows a huge surge in growth for Christianity in China which is currently the world&#039;s most &quot;atheist&quot; nation because of the atheist communist government suppressing religion, the research suggests that China will soon become the world&#039;s most Christian nation within 15 years. <br><br>This is simply history repeating itself: Christianity prospered in Rome back in the ancient era when it was suppressed and it still grew in the militant atheist soviet Russia when it was suppressed there only a century ago with the majority of Russians today now also identifying as Christian. Just goes to show that atheist suppression of religion still doesn&#039;t stop religion.<br><br>Sources for the legion of whiny \/Redditor\/ fedoras that will no doubt show up it this thread:<br><br>http:\/\/www.pewforum.org\/2015\/04\/02\/<wbr>religious-projections-2010-2050\/<br>http:\/\/www.pewforum.org\/2012\/12\/18\/<wbr>global-religious-landscape-unaffili<wbr>ated\/<br>http:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/news\/wor<wbr>ldnews\/asia\/china\/10776023\/China-on<wbr>-course-to-become-worlds-most-Chris<wbr>tian-nation-within-15-years.html<br>http:\/\/masterrussian.com\/russia\/fac<wbr>ts.htm","filename":"1490142549767","ext":".jpg","w":608,"h":755,"tn_w":201,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492005662330,"time":1492005662,"md5":"gbLQR\/M\/TdWWLU+dYjIA+Q==","fsize":123410,"resto":0,"id":"R054xK6d","country":"PL","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"atheism-is-the-fastest-shrinking-religion-in-the","country_name":"Poland","replies":20,"images":3,"unique_ips":15},{"no":120758495,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)10:02:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120758345\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120758345<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;aitheism<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;a religion <\/span><br><br>sage","time":1492005767,"resto":120758345,"id":"1xryPVM4","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120758538,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)10:03:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"It almost appears that atheism rate decreses with global iq droping","time":1492005803,"resto":120758345,"id":"MX6p5SBo","country":"HR","country_name":"Croatia"},{"no":120758541,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)10:03:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"According to most definitions of this term, Atheism isn&#039;t a religion.","time":1492005804,"resto":120758345,"id":"O8EQo37g","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":120758783,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)10:06:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"ohlookitsthisthreadagain<br>le sigh","time":1492005969,"resto":120758345,"id":"1c1sGPUk","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120758862,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)10:06:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"Islam is the fastest growing religion and will supplant Christianity soon. <br><br>http:\/\/www.pewresearch.org\/fact-tan<wbr>k\/2017\/04\/06\/why-muslims-are-the-wo<wbr>rlds-fastest-growing-religious-grou<wbr>p\/<br><br>I don&#039;t think there&#039;s any hope for atheism but at least maybe there will be for secular government.","time":1492006013,"resto":120758345,"id":"LiZA3ysz","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":120758913,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)10:07:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120758345\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120758345<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;shopped image<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;posted everyday<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;mods ignore it<\/span><br>Are these the new BBC threads?","time":1492006033,"resto":120758345,"id":"WOM90eNk","country":"HU","country_name":"Hungary"},{"no":120760225,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)10:20:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120758345\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120758345<\/a><br>The fact alone that China is supposed to be atheist, when chinks are literally amongst the most superstitious people on earth shows how worthless this study is.

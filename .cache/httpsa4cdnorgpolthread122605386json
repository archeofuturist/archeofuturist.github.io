A great creator with a plan in what seems like a chaotic universe fills them with anger. They have never received guidance and any given contradicts their enjoyment of life. Selfless service, sacrifice, and abstinence of any degree is seen as an offense against their hedonistic lifestyle seeing as most are middle class ruts living off their parent&#039;s accomplishments which they have no respect for. <br>Long story short, they are perverts with daddy issues who hate authority.","time":1493052592,"resto":122605386,"id":"SncnxjSu","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122608078,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)13:02:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122606408\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122606408<\/a><br>I&#039;m not even being smug, it makes no rational sense to believe in a personal god, even if you&#039;re talking about an impersonal god like a deist one there&#039;s still no reason to believe in one because there&#039;s no proof, and I&#039;m not a liberal or leftist.","time":1493053362,"resto":122605386,"id":"VFj9JIgg","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122608085,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)13:02:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122605883\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122605883<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;He can stop all violence the any moment he feels like it but doesn&#039;t.<\/span><br>It would violate free will if he did.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;He forgave us for our sins and still sentences us to death.<\/span><br>You don&#039;t die in the sense you&#039;re wiped from existence, merely your physical vessel dies.

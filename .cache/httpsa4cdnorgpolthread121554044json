None of this was established. That&#039;s ultimately why there was no legal basis to object to the blacks being turned loose and how we became so cucked (and kiked) that now it&#039;s illegal to have race aware policies that could maintain a white majority. Because individual rights and (((equality))). So we settle for Trump and his under the radar pro-white policies, but don&#039;t pretend that we can turn things around.

Islam is globalist at the very dogmatic core, and its purpose is to make the whole world part or their community by prayer or by sword. <br><br>The current implementation (Saudi, Iran) is a bastardization of that concept mixed with tribalistic overtones but, at its core, the concept of &quot;reformed islam&quot; is an oxymoron. Islam is supposed to be perfect as narrated by God mouth to Mohamed ears, transcribed perfectly at the Quran <br><br>Tl;dr: Islam and globalism go hand in hand, making it easy to flood an area with muslims and control them wholesale later through their religious allegiances while ***rejecting all other authority***<br><br>Tl;dr2: remove kebab.

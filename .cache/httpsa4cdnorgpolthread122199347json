How the Tech Company&#039;s plan on betraying the IC.","com":"Tech Company&#039;s &amp; the IC have had a cozy relationship for a long time. With the IC setting up\/working with the Tech Company&#039;s for R&amp;D &amp; &quot;off the record&quot; projects.<br><br>Everything the IC has, the Tech Company&#039;s know inside and out. This is due to The IC(when it&#039;s not building things in-house) relying on Tech Company&#039;s for equipment and things like that.<br><br>Tech Company&#039;s have turned into an IC of there own. Mass databases, facial recondition, etc. Tech Company&#039;s have very similar(in some cases identical) tools as the IC. <br><br>But here is the thing, the Tech Company&#039;s have lots of connections &amp; make many deals that the IC isn&#039;t fully aware of when it comes to certain things. Such as [Back-Doors]<br><br>[Back-Doors] exist in all of IC&#039;s tech. Which means many different organizations\/agencies can get into them and use them.(This is very ironic consider the IC uses [Back-Doors] in tech for spying &amp; sabotage.)<br><br>The Deep State, Competing IC agency&#039;s(They sabotage eachother) &amp; Foreign IC(China,Israel,Globalist IC networks, UK, Europe, etc) can get into them to use them. (Whole IC Agency&#039;s tech is likely compromised &amp; could even be simultaneously shut down).<br><br>Some Globalists consider Tech Company&#039;s more important then the IC when it comes to Endgame goals. While both the IC &amp; Tech Company&#039;s are means to an end &amp; have different roles\/usages, the Tech Company&#039;s are closer to some Globalist groups then to the Country&#039;s &amp; Governments they work with.","filename":"Pyramidz","ext":".jpg","w":1000,"h":667,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1492815825441,"time":1492815825,"md5":"VJfTrDSEn1je8f7y\/rdkig==","fsize":162883,"resto":0,"id":"lNe59Qjj","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"knowledge-bomb-how-the-tech-companys-plan-on","trip":"!!9O2tecpDHQ6","country_name":"United States","replies":195,"images":35,"unique_ips":71,"tail_size":50},{"no":122199367,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)19:03:59","name":"Anonymous5","com":"PAST THREADS TO DIG INTO:<br><br>http:\/\/archive.4plebs.org\/pol\/searc<wbr>h\/subject\/knowledge%20bomb\/username<wbr>\/anonymous5\/tripcode\/%21%219O2tecpD<wbr>HQ6\/","time":1492815839,"resto":122199347,"id":"lNe59Qjj","country":"US","trip":"!!9O2tecpDHQ6","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122199384,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)19:04:17","name":"Anonymous5","com":"Future topics I plan on covering:<br><br>1) Women &amp; Cycles.<br><br>2) Zombies &amp; Bioweapons(Race &amp; Sex)<br><br>3) The Globalist Endgame<br><br>4) NoFap,Child Free &amp; MGTOW<br><br>5) Freemasons\/Masons<br><br>6) Globalist Structures<br><br>7) &quot;Greater Israel&quot;,Samson Option &amp; Zionists\/Zionism.<br><br>8) Feminism &amp; Frontal Lobe Damage\/Disorder. <br><br>9) Globalist Symbols<br><br>10) Domino Destabilization.","filename":"Pyramid","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":600,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492815857185,"time":1492815857,"md5":"Z7Rm4c8GlZgzPn\/nH3hYYA==","fsize":67046,"resto":122199347,"id":"lNe59Qjj","country":"US","trip":"!!9O2tecpDHQ6","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122199883,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)19:08:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122199347\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122199347<\/a><br>Why hasn&#039;t anyone bumped this yet?","time":1492816135,"resto":122199347,"id":"VgR8lc5i","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122199918,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)19:09:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122199384\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122199384<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;3) The Globalist Endgame<\/span><br><br>Looking forward to hear more of your views on this.","time":1492816150,"resto":122199347,"id":"XAgbvY6s","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":122199982,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)19:09:46","name":"Anonymous5","com":"<a href=\"#p122199883\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122199883<\/a><br><br>Good question &amp; thanks for the bump.<br><br><a href=\"#p122199918\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122199918<\/a><br><br>I think people will be very interested in it.","time":1492816186,"resto":122199347,"id":"lNe59Qjj","country":"US","trip":"!!9O2tecpDHQ6","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122200048,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)19:10:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122199347\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122199347<\/a><br>What&#039;s the &quot;IC&quot; anyway?

I&#039;ve started to notice the effects of fandoms, especially on young women. It seems that it&#039;s a kind of social engineering that targets the more introverted girls of society, usually who also happen to live in a rural area with more traditional and modest values. They get into these fandoms though, and it changes them for the worst. The fact so many fandoms revolve around things like pairing and sex fanfics would imply that it might be a source of degeneracy that is being spread on purpose. Plus the results of fandoms either lead women to become immodest SJW&#039;s themselves, or to become the male equivalent of neets.

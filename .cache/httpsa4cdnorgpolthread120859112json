The gvt remain one of the biggest employers and all their jobs are bullshit. Managers and directors at every small niche you can think of, as well as an abundance of administrators, who also have managers, team leaders etc. Their jobs are entirely non productive and serve absolutely no purpose at all. <br><br>Just take one example. Schools, the gvt decide how much schools should get and then pass the money onto the board of education, who in turn pass it out to individual states, who then pass it onto individual counties, who then pass it on to the schools. However, at every level you get the same jobs repeating the exact same process. In the end the schools receive barely 10% of what it cost in administration fees. What makes it worse is that gvt employees get free health care, a iron clad, gold standard pension as well as the highest employment rights. It&#039;s almost impossible to be fired, you can take years off on full pay for stress. Get fucking rid of these leaches, if they&#039;re so great they could do something productive with their lives instead.","time":1492054058,"resto":120859112,"id":"ekO6Ez62","country":"TH","country_name":"Thailand"},{"no":120860516,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)23:29:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120859112\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120859112<\/a><br>Human resources departments.<br><br>Employees should be hired\/fired by the managers of the division of the company where they work. The increasing trend to centralize personnel decisions in a division of a company with no direct connection to the actual business operations over the last decade or so is largely why companies are having so much trouble hiring good employees these days. Using HR departments gives you generically likable, outgoing employees who are good at interviewing, but doesn&#039;t select for actual competence or fit in the division of the company where they&#039;ll be working.","time":1492054157,"resto":120859112,"id":"JY\/qRxF2","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

We will bring the bigger boards online first, then work our way to the smaller ones. Boards will be coming up one at a time so we can monitor thread and post recovery. I will let you know here if there are any delays.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;April 1, 2017 - 4:00pm [GMT] - We have located the breach and are auditing scripts for security holes.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Boards should start coming back online in the next few hours as we restore from backup. We will be restoring the most active boards first. Some media files were lost in the hack and those images\/videos will need to be reuploaded. Due to infrequent backups, our user database will need to be rolled back about a month; any claims since the previous backup will need to be reclaimed. As of now, I think we did not lose any posts or threads.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Note:<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The hacker deleted all the databases.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;We have backups of most posts and threads.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;As of now, I cannot find an indication that the hacker downloaded the databases, however it is highly recommended you change any password that might be shared with your mod.php account.<\/span><br><br>This should be a major concern for everyone on the right. Whether or not you have a conspiracy theory or a view on Jim or imkampfy or hotwheels or anyone else this is major. It needs to be discussed and we need to have a thread to gather info and keep updates. Here it is.","filename":"Screenshot_2017-04-02-02-58-01(1)","ext":".jpg","w":720,"h":1009,"tn_w":178,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491121079985,"time":1491121079,"md5":"YpYtnTZqQorPCOpVo03ZnA==","fsize":347245,"resto":0,"id":"yhJzgvvC","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"loop-chan-hack-general-filipino-masonic-server","country_name":"United States","replies":7,"images":1,"unique_ips":4},{"no":119179880,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)04:22:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"2nd update screenshot","filename":"Screenshot_2017-04-02-02-58-08(1)","ext":".jpg","w":720,"h":964,"tn_w":93,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491121333947,"time":1491121333,"md5":"tGOfK2KgyNhz29UsfvpVGw==","fsize":391549,"resto":119179646,"id":"yhJzgvvC","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119179904,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)04:22:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"So we are sure it wasn&#039;t some kind of April Fools thing, right?

When the capitalist class has been completely vanquished, there will be only one class, the working class, and eventually the functions of the state will become indistinguishable from the functions of the society as a whole, and the state as such will &#039;wither away&#039; as Marx said.<\/span><br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/ma<wbr>rx\/works\/1847\/11\/prin-com.htm<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/ma<wbr>rx\/works\/1848\/communist-manifesto\/<br><br>ML uses a philosophy called dialectical materialism, see here:<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/reference\/<wbr>archive\/stalin\/works\/1938\/09.htm<br><br>It is recommended that you read some of the critical works of Marxism-Leninism so you can make an informed assessment of the ideology.<br><br>Resources:<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/ma<wbr>rx\/works\/sw\/<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/le<wbr>nin\/works\/sw\/<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/reference\/<wbr>archive\/stalin\/works\/decades-index.<wbr>htm<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/reference\/<wbr>archive\/mao\/selected-works\/<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/ma<wbr>rx\/works\/1884\/origin-family\/<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/le<wbr>nin\/works\/1914\/mar\/11.htm","filename":"1481244074852","ext":".png","w":1010,"h":1010,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491405186715,"time":1491405186,"md5":"676S1nirnOI5InkeibSxFw==","fsize":177742,"resto":0,"id":"Bj8z5LOK","country":"ES","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"communism-general","country_name":"Spain","replies":90,"images":39,"unique_ips":39},{"no":119615571,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)11:17:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"Communism has done nothing but undermine the core aspects of civilisation which are family and duty.<br><br>In order to save the West, you focus on its core elements - the family, marriage - strengthen them, stop them from being undermined, and honour your duties.<br><br>Man is lost, they are ignoring their biological purpose, they have their head in the prison of infinite choice. <br><br>It&#039;s time to go back to what made our civilisation prosper in the first place, it&#039;s time to go back to family...<br><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/1rKXcFQIGHM","filename":"1491405295434","ext":".jpg","w":900,"h":1024,"tn_w":109,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491405437932,"time":1491405437,"md5":"fWxwS0W4i1CBlgdz2KJLRw==","fsize":251118,"resto":119615212,"id":"oBGUAS6p","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119615666,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)11:18:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"Hows Venezuela doing?","filename":"feelsgood","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":400,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1491405499618,"time":1491405499,"md5":"FEgfAGL89dpFLJ5+8ZuKmw==","fsize":37418,"resto":119615212,"id":"KkHF\/iHU","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119615765,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)11:19:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"For everything you need to know about communism, see attached pic.","filename":"1491239257322","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":640,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491405570724,"time":1491405570,"md5":"ClSBvP3fRgDEayCD\/Wgw1Q==","fsize":62018,"resto":119615212,"id":"ajJVfHnS","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119617114,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)11:34:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Muh comrades, I&#039;m too pathetic and lazy to get a job so I will support an ideology that has never worked.<\/span>","time":1491406451,"resto":119615212,"id":"lM7mi6NX","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119617283,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)11:35:37","name":"Anonymous","filename":"106756b50d0857970de3f0de99a61744d447c5eba009e9c3c9f5da9723fea1ef","ext":".png","w":540,"h":652,"tn_w":103,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491406537824,"time":1491406537,"md5":"UguHbDgIeOemyZmy1lxy7Q==","fsize":205243,"resto":119615212,"id":"Bj8z5LOK","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":119617776,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)11:40:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;there will be only one class, the working class, and eventually the working class will become the new capitalist class<\/span><br>fixdthat","time":1491406810,"resto":119615212,"id":"EltNBYMc","country":"CR","country_name":"Costa Rica"},{"no":119618110,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)11:43:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119615666\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119615666<\/a><br>checked nd rekt communism btfo forever","time":1491406989,"resto":119615212,"id":"kjJNHrdd","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119618199,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)11:43:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119615571\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119615571<\/a><br>How is the right wing any different from the truth?

Those identified as spies, &quot;running dogs&quot;, &quot;revisionists&quot;, or coming from a suspect class (including those related to former landlords or rich peasants) were subject to beating, imprisonment, rape, torture, sustained and systematic harassment and abuse, seizure of property, denial of medical attention, and erasure of social identity. At least hundreds of thousands of people were murdered, starved, or worked to death. Millions more were forcibly displaced. Young people from the cities were forcibly moved to the countryside, where they were forced to abandon all forms of standard education in place of the propaganda teachings of the Communist Party of China. Some people were not able to stand the torture and, losing hope for the future, committed suicide. One of the most famous cases of attempted suicide due to political persecution involved Deng Xiaoping&#039;s son, Deng Pufang, who jumped (or was thrown) from a four-story building after being &quot;interrogated&quot; by Red Guards. Instead of dying, he became paraplegic. In the trial of the so-called Gang of Four, a Chinese court stated that 729,511 people had been persecuted, of whom 34,800 were said to have died.<\/span>","filename":"this","ext":".gif","w":300,"h":186,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":77,"tim":1491411510787,"time":1491411510,"md5":"2QvEWltH00xEmwRTt0hTHg==","fsize":456666,"resto":119615212,"id":"luvakPhX","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119626789,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)13:01:53","name":"Anonymous","filename":"b1b457b1c75174545c835e0bd9b4475f0100536d0de9440419267d7976311352","ext":".jpg","w":736,"h":1105,"tn_w":83,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491411713386,"time":1491411713,"md5":"92wDnblV4FGjUdr+gc2hHw==","fsize":98907,"resto":119615212,"id":"ty3\/4ZWz","country":"ES","m_img":1,"country_name":"Spain"},{"no":119628198,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)13:15:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119626789\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119626789<\/a><br><br>Dat NKVD.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Following the German invasion of the Soviet Union on June 22, 1941, the NKVD (Soviet Secret Police) in Lvov began carrying out mass executions of prisoners in the jails on Kamierswska, Leona Spaieky, and Zamarstynowska streets before retreating into the USSR. The victims were mostly Ukrainian nationalists, but also included Polish and Ukrainian intellectuals, as well as some Jews. When German troops arrived in Lvov on June 30, they found over 4,000 corpses of men, women and children in the NKVD prisons, many of whom showed signs of torture, rape, and mutilation. The actual number of victims is difficult to ascertain, due to the fact that two of prisons&#039; basements were filled with bodies from floor to ceiling, making passage into further rooms, which presumably contained more bodies, impossible. Confronted with such a large number of corpses, the German authorities laid out for identification those bodies suitable for transport found on the upper stories of the prisons, but chose to seal the entrances to the basements after covering the victims with lye. <\/span><br>https:\/\/collections.ushmm.org\/searc<wbr>h\/catalog\/pa1153801","filename":"nkvd","ext":".jpg","w":800,"h":583,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":91,"tim":1491412507105,"time":1491412507,"md5":"FBoPxJLHyGXKMSSIV8e4XQ==","fsize":250442,"resto":119615212,"id":"luvakPhX","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119628363,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)13:16:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"Hello gomrades!

Plato\u2019s Apology tells how Socrates was condemned by the Athenian citizenry for corrupting the morals of the young and doubting the gods. There was some truth to that complaint. Socrates called conventional wisdom into question. He subjected long-standing beliefs to rational scrutiny and speculated about concerns that projected beyond the existing order. What became known as \u201ccritical theory\u201d was built upon this legacy. The new philosophical tendency was generated between World War I and World War II, and its most important representatives would wage an unrelenting assault on the exploitation, repression, and alienation embedded within Western civilization.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Critical theory was conceived within the intellectual crucible of Marxism. But its leading representatives were from the start dismissive of economic determinism, the stage theory of history, and any fatalistic belief in the \u201cinevitable\u201d triumph of socialism. They were concerned less with what Marx called the economic \u201cbase\u201d than the political and cultural \u201csuperstructure\u201d of society. Their Marxism was of a different variety. They highlighted its critical method over its systematic claims, its concern with alienation and reification, its complicated relationship with the ideals of the Enlightenment, its utopian moment, its emphasis upon the role of ideology, and its commitment to resist thedeformation of the individual. This complex of themes constitutes the core of critical theory as it was conceived by the leading figures of \u201cWestern Marxism\u201d: Karl Korsch and Georg Luk\u00e1cs. These two thinkers provided the framework for the critical project that later became identified with the Institute for Social Research\u2014or \u201cthe Frankfurt School.\u201d<\/span><br><br>1\/2","time":1491412889,"resto":119615212,"id":"s8xb9hqK","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119628923,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)13:21:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119628886\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119628886<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The Frankfurt School had always considered establishmentarian philosophies as obstacles to bringing about a liberated society. Its members condemned the preoccupation with absolute foundations, analytic categories, and fixed criteria for verifying truth cclaims. They saw two main culprits: phenomenology , with its set ontological claims about how individuals experience existence, and positivism , with its demand that society be analyzed according to the criteria of the natural sciences. Both were attacked for treating society in a-historical terms and eliminating genuine subjectivity.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Critical theory was intended as an alternative. It was fueled by a transformative intent and a particular concern with the culture of modern life.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;These thinkers became champions of an experimental modernist art and, in the charged climate of the postwar period, an \u201cAesopian\u201d form of convoluted writing that shielded their radical beliefs.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;\u201cNegative dialectics\u201d anticipated many concerns associated with postmodernism and poststructuralism. So much so, in fact, that they are now often treated as expressions of critical theory.

There is never a good reason for a federal government to put any restrictions whatsoever on firearms. The only reason why they would ever do that would be to weaken the population and make it easier to oppress them. You think the American Revolution was a murderous rampage? Pull your head out of your ass. Even the American Civil War, which was based on the flawed premise that slavery was acceptable did not demonstrate a problem with lack of gun control. Let&#039;s say that the South had been on the side of righteousness and NOT on the side of the democratic elites. The farmers who made up the bulk of the confederate army were just misled by wealthy elites and slaveowners. The problem in that case was the government (both federal and state) had too much influence over people&#039;s decisions. If the Southern governments at the time gave people a chance to understand basic economics the Northerners and Southerners would have united in rebellion against both the Southern elites and the radical republicans at the time(not Lincoln) You are legitimately braindead.","time":1490396131,"resto":118142553,"id":"X4anGZwB","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118146929,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)19:01:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118146132\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118146132<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Most people are a lot smarter than you Russians<\/span><br><br>yeah, most people dont vote for Hillary, but most americucks do<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;There is never a good reason for a federal government to put any restrictions whatsoever on firearms.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;what is mass shootings<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;muh civil war<\/span><br><br>american civil war was a childrens game but not a war<br><br>Jesus Christ, are you 12 or what?

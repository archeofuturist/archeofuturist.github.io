Guns are a very effective tool, so you do need it in that sense; and the things like semi-automatic function and lots of rounds and quick changeable magazines make it more effective, so you do need those as well. The need is validated by the severity of the situation--the point is to survive, and so you need the best thing to accomplish that goal.<br><br>It&#039;s the definition of &quot;need&quot; that these people try to dupe you with, they are asking a loaded question. They say it like they&#039;re asking &quot;is it biologically necessary to possess that&quot;--in that case no, but no one&#039;s arguing that it&#039;s THAT kind of need. Additionally, their implied definition of need seems to have a sense of immediacy--that is, they ask &quot;do you need it right now&quot;. Technically no, but then again a gun is like seatbelts or health insurance--you don&#039;t strictly need either of those when you&#039;re not colliding with another car or being sick respectively, but those are things you have to PREVENT or RESPOND to situations. And in those situations, it IS a literal immediate survival NEED.<br><br>In an greater sense, you don&#039;t &quot;need to need&quot; a gun, in order to justifiably possess it--you are by nature an independent human and do not have to answer to other people for actions that do not directly involve them. If they are pearl-clutching self-important numbskulls who object to your survival instinct as part of your natural function, then that is THEIR problem, not yours.<br>This is just my opinion, but hopefully it gets the noggin joggin.","time":1492657443,"resto":121939532,"id":"AauCeE9k","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121942694,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)23:06:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121941916\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121941916<\/a><br>Honestly I don&#039;t think he has any criteria, he just scoffs at the idea of owning them.<br><br><a href=\"#p121942386\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121942386<\/a><br>Yeah, man.

It makes no sense in principle to &quot;blame&quot; and &quot;punish&quot; a technology for being used badly, because if you removed the guns then there would still be bad people. It&#039;s the bad people, armed or otherwise, that are the problem, and if you remove firearms from general use, then the net result is that you&#039;ve removed a means (moreover, the most effective means) for individual citizens to &quot;solve&quot; the problem of bad people (including and especially organizations) trying to harm them in any way, via firearm or otherwise.","time":1492662253,"resto":121939532,"id":"AauCeE9k","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121951548,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)00:25:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121947833\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121947833<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121948493\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121948493<\/a><br><br><a href=\"#p121951390\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121951390<\/a> continued:<br>3) this may sound like a kinda silly point, but it&#039;s not the fault of firearms that people die; it&#039;s peoples&#039; mortal condition.

Technologies in general, including firearms, will never go away in principle because they are permitted by the laws of physics, the laws of nature--and no artificial law can veto or overwrite natural law. Thus, you cannot truly outlaw firearms. So you are left with the choice to use the technologies available to you to maintain and secure your survival; this is a kind of universal common theme in human behavior, that is, using tools to survive and thrive. So, firearms are there whether you (kind of speaking to gun-grabber) like it or not, and if you choose not to use this technology--if you are too reluctant or mentally feeble to take whatever action reasonably effective to secure your life--then you are bound to die, sooner or later, by firearm or not.

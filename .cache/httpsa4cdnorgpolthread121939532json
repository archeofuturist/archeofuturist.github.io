Guns are a very effective tool, so you do need it in that sense; and the things like semi-automatic function and lots of rounds and quick changeable magazines make it more effective, so you do need those as well. The need is validated by the severity of the situation--the point is to survive, and so you need the best thing to accomplish that goal.<br><br>It&#039;s the definition of &quot;need&quot; that these people try to dupe you with, they are asking a loaded question. They say it like they&#039;re asking &quot;is it biologically necessary to possess that&quot;--in that case no, but no one&#039;s arguing that it&#039;s THAT kind of need. Additionally, their implied definition of need seems to have a sense of immediacy--that is, they ask &quot;do you need it right now&quot;. Technically no, but then again a gun is like seatbelts or health insurance--you don&#039;t strictly need either of those when you&#039;re not colliding with another car or being sick respectively, but those are things you have to PREVENT or RESPOND to situations. And in those situations, it IS a literal immediate survival NEED.<br><br>In an greater sense, you don&#039;t &quot;need to need&quot; a gun, in order to justifiably possess it--you are by nature an independent human and do not have to answer to other people for actions that do not directly involve them. If they are pearl-clutching self-important numbskulls who object to your survival instinct as part of your natural function, then that is THEIR problem, not yours.<br>This is just my opinion, but hopefully it gets the noggin joggin.","time":1492657443,"resto":121939532,"id":"AauCeE9k","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121942694,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)23:06:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121941916\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121941916<\/a><br>Honestly I don&#039;t think he has any criteria, he just scoffs at the idea of owning them.<br><br><a href=\"#p121942386\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121942386<\/a><br>Yeah, man.

Thanks for showing that not all leftists are autistic retards that can&#039;t handle opinions. If the left was full of more rational and respectable people like you, maybe the right would be less biased against it. Maybe the left could be the moral high ground that it alleged to be, years ago.<br><br>Argument is essential. We might feel like we have all the answers but it&#039;s important to listen to one another so we can understand where each of us is coming from. <br><br>Having said all that, I need to ask you about &quot;moderate&quot; Muslims. You understand that &quot;moderate&quot; Muslims can&#039;t exist while &quot;true&quot; Muslims are still killing in the name of their god, right?","time":1491778680,"resto":120351634,"id":"nVxccIiT","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

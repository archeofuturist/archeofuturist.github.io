Mother&#039;s that want one likely aren&#039;t going to give any more of a shit about the kid if they&#039;re forced to carry it to term. I don&#039;t think abortions should be state funded. I&#039;d say only in rape cases but then we&#039;d just have an increase in fake rape accusations. Ultimately there&#039;s probably less harm in letting it be legal and non-state funded rather than making it illegal and forcing those that would want one to take illegal means or raise a child they&#039;ll resent forever.","time":1492493266,"resto":121643454,"id":"C6j1qUUX","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121644266,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)01:29:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"The problem with this is that not every woman who gets an abortion is a result of them &quot;fucking up&quot;.

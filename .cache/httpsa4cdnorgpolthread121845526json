You are a fucking nigeriously negroidal niglet and deserve to be gassed.<br><br>The reason that U.S. production skyrocketed beginning circa 2009 was because oil price was high and the combination of horizontal drilling with multi-stage fracturing techniques were allowing for the economic production of source rock reservoirs (read: LTO, or &quot;light &amp; tight oil&quot;). Even as U.S. production soared, various government controls on domestic and international prices of oil caused the price to remain high for the next several years.<br><br>Then, beginning in June of 2014, prices began to respond to high U.S. oil production as inventories exceeded predictions year after year. Three months later, in that September, the Saudis reacted to the impending loss of their market share to the Americas by ramping up production, which resulted in the sudden and precipitous drop in oil price for the remainder of 2014.<br><br>To this day, Saudis are burning through mountains of cash to hang onto their marketshare, but they are losing it. They have also been forced to radically restructure their government and spending, alongside Venezuela and Russia. In other words, you&#039;re a fucking idiot and Saudis are being hurt just as much as Russian and Venezuela in this scenario.<br><br>Now, U.S. oil companies aren&#039;t doing fantastically either, but there&#039;s an ever-dropping price floor for LTO production and the U.S. can drill and POP this wells in less than a week. And these reserves are vast. *VAST.* This makes the old regime of funding your socialist utopia on high oil prices a permanent thing of the past, and I&#039;m shedding no tears over starving Venezuelan commies and Saudi royalty that can no longer afford harems of underaged girls from Ukraine.","time":1492612054,"resto":121845526,"id":"CmZitrhm","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":121849335,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)10:28:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121848799\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121848799<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Styx<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Having to watch a manchild for a history lesson <\/span><br>Can&#039;t anybody write anymore?","time":1492612136,"resto":121845526,"id":"rQGnGpYD","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121849440,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)10:29:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121849200\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121849200<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;and I&#039;m shedding no tears over starving Venezuelan commies and Saudi royalty that can no longer afford harems of underaged girls from Ukraine.<\/span><br><br>Hy a Pa\u0448\u043aa?

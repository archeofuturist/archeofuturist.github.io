We&#039;ve seen evolution in recorded history, like dog breeds, for example, so its existence cannot be completely refuted. But what function did birds&#039; wings have before birds were able to fly? If we&#039;re supposed to believe evolution happens through random mutations, it seems awful strange that those random mutations would be so persistent, and so directed, towards a specific goal, such as flight for birds, when many, many generations would have to pass before the wings had any functionality at all.

He protested against the agelong program for preparing the mortals of space for some unknown destiny and pointed to the presence of the finaliter corps on Jerusem as proof that these mortals had spent ages of preparation for some destiny of pure fiction. With derision he pointed out that the finaliters had encountered a destiny no more glorious than to be returned to humble spheres similar to those of their origin. He intimated that they had been debauched by overmuch discipline and prolonged training, and that they were in reality traitors to their mortal fellows since they were now co-operating with the scheme of enslaving all creation to the fictions of a mythical eternal destiny for ascending mortals.

reasons why our roads are shittier than yours<br>1. there is 4,071,000 miles of road (6,551,639 km) in the United States. This is more than all of Europe combined (5,800,000 ish km) How do you afford to repave these roads every year?<br><br>2. We can&#039;t repave our roads every 5 years like Mediterranean countries do. Most of the United states faces a harsh temperature change throughout the year that make brand new roads riddled with potholes from a single winter. This is impossible to do, that&#039;s why you see some roads that were neglected to be repaved for a few years.<br><br>3. We have a lot more cars than you do. The average american owns 2 cars and commutes on average 50 miles (80 km) back and forth everyday. This means that roads face much more abuse here than the roads in europe.<br><br>4. We drive heavier vehicles. trucks vs cars in most places in america is about 50\/50. Trucks use a more aggressive tread than cars that wear ruts into the roads and eventually potholes form.<br><br>5.

I live in an old southern town and we recently demolished our 100 year old town hall yet many roads in the old part of our town need to be fixed. I&#039;d say it&#039;s simply ineptitude on part of the city council (3 seats) and mayor. No one has a degree in civic engineering nor have they even taken a class in human geography. I plan on running next election cycle solely to deal with this issue and our drug problem.

Traditionalism refers to tradition, as-in keeping things as they are. To be traditionalist in a largely christian society and to be pro-Islam are two things that do not match.

It became &#039;cool&#039; to protest and fight the police state, to the point where agreeing with the government and being a uni student at the same time was social suicide. Also keep in mind that censuring criticism directed at the government generates corruption, since the population will no longer be able to keep their leaders in check. It also creates a mindset of &#039;being above law&#039;, which leads to more and more people taking interest in politics, since they&#039;d be beyond criticism. <br><br><a href=\"#p121399817\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121399817<\/a><br><br>The Soviets were never truly a superpower by technological standards.

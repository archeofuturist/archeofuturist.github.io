Why?","com":"So today I go to visit the construction site where my new house is being built to check on the progress and what do I find? The one year old white oak tree at the front of the yard is broken off at ground level! Some lazy tard has run over it with a truck. That tree was beautiful and it was going to shade my new white house. I would have sat under it on sunny days and drank cans of mountain dew. It would have beautified the neighborhood and been a benefit to my white family. And now its all fucked because a lazy blue collar prick couldn&#039;t do his job right. You have a piss-easy job dickhead - drive a truck and don&#039;t fuck up other people&#039;s shit. And you couldn&#039;t even get that right. The only upside to Australian politicians taking a giant shit on the demographics of this country with their fucked-up high immigration policy, is that if they import enough refugees the wages of Australian tradesmen will fall to what those useless stooges are actually worth: three-fifths of fuck all.","filename":"Construction worker","ext":".jpg","w":300,"h":406,"tn_w":184,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493544967852,"time":1493544967,"md5":"EjC2fST8o3JLlJEoOWfYyQ==","fsize":61761,"resto":0,"id":"kQMQ5Tsi","country":"AU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"why-are-blue-collar-workers-so-lazy-and-spiteful","country_name":"Australia","replies":18,"images":1,"unique_ips":12},{"no":123461385,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)05:39:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"this isn&#039;t even bait broseph, come back with something better, cunt","filename":"Screenshot_20170430_023847","ext":".png","w":362,"h":260,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":89,"tim":1493545178614,"time":1493545178,"md5":"\/7v8eSCgLfEVWA\/w5O4jGw==","fsize":42008,"resto":123461156,"id":"rkL8cZOw","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123461443,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)05:40:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"hah my captch after that f&#039;re so damn rich, faggotailed was roble sale, so buy another oak if you","time":1493545222,"resto":123461156,"id":"rkL8cZOw","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123462054,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)05:49:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123461156\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123461156<\/a><br>Chinks can&#039;t drive, that&#039;s what you get","time":1493545749,"resto":123461156,"id":"UsukZIFC","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":123462550,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)05:56:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123461156\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123461156<\/a><br>you&#039;re complaining about a fucking tree, do you think you&#039;re some kind of royalty? grow the fuck up and quit bitching, I deal with people who complain about NON-ISSUES all day, youre just another crayfish underthe rock in the crik down yonder&#039;.","time":1493546207,"resto":123461156,"id":"GLvM6U5S","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123463149,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)06:05:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123462550\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123462550<\/a><br>I paid for the fucking tree!

In the US the influx of Mexican migrants have only hurt American workers at the absolute lowest rung. I work in construction and what I&#039;ve witnessed is that the very cheap labor pool has increased profits in the industry to the point that construction companies are expanding and they are always hiring at competitive rates. There simply arent enough migrants to replace the amount of skilled tradesmen needed. I could tell my boss fuck you and get a job the next day probably making more money.

Why?","com":"So today I go to visit the construction site where my new house is being built to check on the progress and what do I find? The one year old white oak tree at the front of the yard is broken off at ground level! Some lazy tard has run over it with a truck. That tree was beautiful and it was going to shade my new white house. I would have sat under it on sunny days and drank cans of mountain dew. It would have beautified the neighborhood and been a benefit to my white family. And now its all fucked because a lazy blue collar prick couldn&#039;t do his job right. You have a piss-easy job dickhead - drive a truck and don&#039;t fuck up other people&#039;s shit. And you couldn&#039;t even get that right. The only upside to Australian politicians taking a giant shit on the demographics of this country with their fucked-up high immigration policy, is that if they import enough refugees the wages of Australian tradesmen will fall to what those useless stooges are actually worth: three-fifths of fuck all.","filename":"Construction worker","ext":".jpg","w":300,"h":406,"tn_w":184,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493544967852,"time":1493544967,"md5":"EjC2fST8o3JLlJEoOWfYyQ==","fsize":61761,"resto":0,"id":"kQMQ5Tsi","country":"AU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"why-are-blue-collar-workers-so-lazy-and-spiteful","country_name":"Australia","replies":2,"images":1,"unique_ips":2},{"no":123461385,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)05:39:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"this isn&#039;t even bait broseph, come back with something better, cunt","filename":"Screenshot_20170430_023847","ext":".png","w":362,"h":260,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":89,"tim":1493545178614,"time":1493545178,"md5":"\/7v8eSCgLfEVWA\/w5O4jGw==","fsize":42008,"resto":123461156,"id":"rkL8cZOw","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123461443,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)05:40:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"hah my captch after that f&#039;re so damn rich, faggotailed was roble sale, so buy another oak if you","time":1493545222,"resto":123461156,"id":"rkL8cZOw","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

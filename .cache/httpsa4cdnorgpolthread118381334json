Both nations were former Warsaw Pact members. U.S. officials said that the system was intended to protect the United States and Europe from possible nuclear missile attacks by Iran or North Korea. Russia, however, viewed the new system as a potential threat and, in response, tested a long-range intercontinental ballistic missile, the RS-24, which it claimed could defeat any defense system. Vladimir Putin warned the U.S. that these new tensions could turn Europe into a &quot;powder keg&quot;. On June 3, 2007, Putin warned that if the U.S. built the missile defense system, Russia would consider targeting missiles at Poland and the Czech Republic.<\/span><br><br>To me and to many others that was unofficial decoration of continuation to the cold war.<br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/kqD8lIdIMRo","time":1490548616,"resto":118381334,"id":"HyNQDZKW","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":118385402,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)13:16:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118384920\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118384920<\/a><br>These men can change history and create a new destiny for the military allaince.

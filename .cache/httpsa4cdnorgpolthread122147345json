Looks? Not really anything anyone can do about it. I mean, surgery only helps so far. Personality? Of course, some women are more friendly and fun than others, but every couple will have their fights and deal with irritating quirks, etc. The Cocksucking? Sure, any girl can suck a cock. But the ONLY part that can have that something special, that je ne sais quoi, that thing that can not be explained...is the cocksucking. The worship. Technique can be taught. The worship can&#039;t. The truth. That&#039;s what pulls the soul out of the dick. <br><br>That&#039;s the stuff that God used to create Eve. The rib bone. The baculum. Eve willed herself into creation by pulling that shit out of Adam. Eve was the first succubus, really. The first great cocksucker. <br><br>Fuck. Holy shit. My third eye is opening up. The entire history of man comes down to finding the greatest cocksucker on the planet. It&#039;s the secret. It&#039;s what keeps the world spinning.<br><br>Fuck bros...I need some water.

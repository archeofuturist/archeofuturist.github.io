I&#039;m a chink and I was born in this country because my parents were fleeing communism. I don&#039;t speak Mandarin, I speak English and French because I wanted to fit into the country.<br><br>My family moved a lot to find jobs and education so I&#039;ve lived all over the country, from Vancouver to St. John&#039;s, NL, and while I was growing up, most of my friends were white and all the white people around me were friendly and welcoming. I hardly noticed that I was a different race until I got older. <br><br>I worked hard and studied and eventually got into medical school so that I could make my parents proud and give back to the country I call home. I pay my taxes, I commit no crimes, I help people when I can and try to be a good neighbor. <br><br>Why do you hate me \/pol\/? I don&#039;t want to go &quot;back&quot; to China. When I visit it&#039;s like an alien fucking world to me. I&#039;m really worried that if some bullshit starts up between China and the west then I&#039;ll have to put up with some serious anti-Chinese sentiment, even though I would fucking join the Canadian Forces as a doctor if it came to that. <br><br>\/pol\/ is a minority of leafs right? I&#039;m not surrounded by white people who are friendly to my face and then shitpost online later right? I always found white people to be forthright rather than duplicitous. What the fuck \/pol\/?<br><br>Also Vancouver is a great fucking city and I can get why so many people want to buy property there. It&#039;s beautiful and there&#039;s lots of fun shit to do.","filename":"helphelper","ext":".png","w":288,"h":175,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":75,"tim":1492319510474,"time":1492319510,"md5":"tGmhMZ\/383q4fh170\/W2mw==","fsize":5917,"resto":121314413,"id":"s3otlm3y","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121320894,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)01:12:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"Guys. <br><br>Who should I vote for in the election??<br><br>They all seem like absolute shit","time":1492319577,"resto":121314413,"id":"RetryIuR","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]}

I need to understand something.<br><br>So every day we hear about the Trump\/Russia connection probe and this nonsensical talk of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. <br><br>My question is, who gives a fuck aside from Never Trumpers and top Democrats? Yes, we know you don&#039;t like Trump and yes, we know you are upset that he won. But what are you trying to spin by saying Trump and Russia are colluding?<br><br>1. How did Russia steal the election from Hillary by showing the clearly undemocratic and unlawful ways the DNC was running their show? All it did was show that the DNC and their super delegates had Hillary coined as their nominee before the election process even started. Which people should be happy about knowing.<br><br>2. Russia had absolutely no idea Trump was going to win the election, just like everyone else had no idea. Everyone was surprised. <br><br>3. The Trump administration has not done anything that empowers Russia or done anything that would hint that Trump is a secret shill for Russia. The administration has been clear on where they stand with Ukraine, Crimea and other hot spots in the world. Trump has not done anything to weaken us.<br><br>4. Wasn&#039;t it the Obama administration that wanted to Buddy up to Iran, and gave them billions of dollars only for Iran to spit in our face? And wasn&#039;t it the Clinton&#039;s that sold Russia 20% of our Uranium? And wasn&#039;t it Obama that told Putin that he would be &quot;more flexible&quot; after the election? The only people cozying up to Russia and our enemies are the liberals and this is based on fact. <br><br>So you can try to divert,distract, and blame others.

Members of the Trump campaign, several of whom were unregistered foreign agents on the payroll of foreign governments, colluded with agents of a foreign government whose payroll they were on to commit crimes intended to influence American Foreign Policy positions. This is espionage. You already try and shift the blame here to the DNC and it&#039;s issues.

Did the Russians have a fucking crystal ball? No, but they shot for an objective that many political analysts have thought was a distinct possibility (Hedges, for instance) and saw a payoff. They don&#039;t have to have literal clairvoyance to be culpable for exerting influence through disinformation, which is a specialty of Russian intelligence.<br><br>3. Trump has acted in Russian interests already. He has weakened US diplomatic positions by leaving high level diplomatic ties, particularly to Europe, unfilled, weakening our alliances with key NATO partners, and undoing various agreements that add to the soft power of the United States of America and various international organizations that act as a check against the belligerent expansion of Russian influence. Only being caught out has prevented him from immediately lifting Russian sanctions because of the effect it would have on domestic optics.<br><br>4. The Iran deal has nothing to do with the Russia issue, you bring it up as a distraction. Nor has Clinton sold Russia 20% of US uranium. You bring this up as yet another smokescreen.<br><br>We can smell your blood in the water these days.

The power of mainstream media, a tool considered extremely powerful beforehand, took a devastating loss.

Ironically, it was their biased coverage of the election and the result that became the catalyst of this growing awareness of the American people.<br><br>2- Hillary Clinton has had an illegal and private server since about the time she became Secretary of State. She had other government officials collect SAPs for her. In exchange for SAPs and money into the Clinton Foundation, they got political favors. Almost immediately, the SAPs she illegally acquired started getting hacked by foreign powers such as Russia, UK, Australia, etc. She initially tried to keep the hacks quiet until she, after a few years, was forced to start confessing to others about it.<br><br>3- In order to keep the lid closed, Soros had her resign her post as SoS. However, she and her staff were still allowed to keep their clearances for plausable denial.

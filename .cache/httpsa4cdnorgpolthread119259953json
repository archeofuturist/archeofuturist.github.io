I need to understand something.<br><br>So every day we hear about the Trump\/Russia connection probe and this nonsensical talk of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. <br><br>My question is, who gives a fuck aside from Never Trumpers and top Democrats? Yes, we know you don&#039;t like Trump and yes, we know you are upset that he won. But what are you trying to spin by saying Trump and Russia are colluding?<br><br>1. How did Russia steal the election from Hillary by showing the clearly undemocratic and unlawful ways the DNC was running their show? All it did was show that the DNC and their super delegates had Hillary coined as their nominee before the election process even started. Which people should be happy about knowing.<br><br>2. Russia had absolutely no idea Trump was going to win the election, just like everyone else had no idea. Everyone was surprised. <br><br>3. The Trump administration has not done anything that empowers Russia or done anything that would hint that Trump is a secret shill for Russia. The administration has been clear on where they stand with Ukraine, Crimea and other hot spots in the world. Trump has not done anything to weaken us.<br><br>4. Wasn&#039;t it the Obama administration that wanted to Buddy up to Iran, and gave them billions of dollars only for Iran to spit in our face? And wasn&#039;t it the Clinton&#039;s that sold Russia 20% of our Uranium? And wasn&#039;t it Obama that told Putin that he would be &quot;more flexible&quot; after the election? The only people cozying up to Russia and our enemies are the liberals and this is based on fact. <br><br>So you can try to divert,distract, and blame others.

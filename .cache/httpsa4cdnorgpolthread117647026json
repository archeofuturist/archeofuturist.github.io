Orthodoxy and Protestantism don&#039;t cut it, as both agree with accepting refugees like Catholicism. I consider that a moral non-starter, even though Orthodoxy doesn&#039;t speak of it much.<br><br>SSPX addresses Church unity, the abuses of Vatican II, the horrors of the current papacy, and takes a nationalistic stance on immigration\/refugees insofar as it follows older teachings that immigration can be rejected if it harms the common good of a nation (interpretation of this is left up to individuals).<br><br>I&#039;ve been reading Fisheaters.com\/forums, and Trad Catholics seem more redpilled than half of this board. I guess I just want to know if any fellow followers of Christ have walked this path and can provide some guidance. I want to be part of the true Church and worship Christ.","filename":"1489625806106","ext":".jpg","w":813,"h":683,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":210,"tim":1490117482837,"time":1490117482,"md5":"f2lmlAQ81V3TJMwESPY8Lw==","fsize":206735,"resto":0,"id":"IHfk58CP","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"does-anyone-have-experience-with-the-catholic","country_name":"United States","replies":5,"images":2,"unique_ips":3},{"no":117647287,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)13:33:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117647026\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117647026<\/a><br>I go to a SSPX chapel.

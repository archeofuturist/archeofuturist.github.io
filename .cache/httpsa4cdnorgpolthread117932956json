Ever since mid election last year, not only have there been organizations like CTR and SB, but larger gov&#039;t owned departments like the CIA have been making threads on here. There threads have been targeting the voters. Namely people like Schulz (they&#039;re testing to see if you&#039;ll accept socialism on a larger scale, like Bernie), and Thierry Baudet (trying to steal votes from Geert. Great candidate, don&#039;t get me wrong, but the time to rally behind Geert was then and there. Thierry will have his time to shine.) Sad really that any of you are falling for this. They realized how weaponized our collective autism is, and instead of trying to shut us down, they&#039;re using us without us being any the wiser. Only a few oldfags will have noticed the inorganic shitposting and shilling.<br>2. We all know the wage gap is bunk all, but do you know the reason they&#039;re pushing it? (((They))) are shoving it down our gaping gullets to shame men into accepting lower wages and increasing their profit margins by taking away from their costs of wages. <br>Stay smart.<br>Stay vigilant.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;And always ask yourself, would a 18-25yr old white male make this thread, or am I being shilled to by someone outside of this group?<\/span><br>Later.","filename":"PEpe181","ext":".png","w":2000,"h":2000,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490277278342,"time":1490277278,"md5":"WsfdZyZTI6ExjYnTLQ\/aqQ==","fsize":784676,"resto":0,"id":"lz0c7lgU","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"warning-to-pol","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":1,"unique_ips":2},{"no":117933442,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)09:59:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117932956\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117932956<\/a><br> Hi Russia.

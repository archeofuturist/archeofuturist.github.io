These &quot;moderates&quot; are known to have the ability to create sarin from scratch and could easily have stolen quantities of Syria&#039;s large stockpile. The death toll also seems extraordinarily low for what would be expected of a standard single or cluster air-burst style weapon. The homes in middle eastern cities are always built close together to shield from the sun and are always open ventilated to the outside air unlike in the west where we use energy saving windows and doors and are accustomed to large lots of land. A high number of children is always expected due to their low body weight, the nerve agents have a canary in the coal mine effect, targeting the small first. There were very few adults in comparison which defies the purpose of the weapons, they should have the strength to kill adults and not just injure them. In addition, the use of such a small quantity defies the logic in using them, why release from one single location when logic dictates a distributed area attack is the most useful, conventional bombs would be better for pinpoint strikes. In interviews with Assad he makes it very clear he understands the international political response to such use of weapons and makes points about why it wouldn&#039;t be even in his own favor to commit such acts.","time":1491678887,"resto":120148020,"id":"1N5CSh9S","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120169546,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)15:17:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120148020\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120148020<\/a><br>A 90 million dollar bluff that some jackoff on a Neapolitan koto luthier enthusiast forum can figure out, but globalist elites will buy hook, line, and sinker?<br><br>Like John McCain&#039;s going, &quot;Oh, I guess it wasn&#039;t muh Russia after all!

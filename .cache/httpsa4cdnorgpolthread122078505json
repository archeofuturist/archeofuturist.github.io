Therein lies the social significance of art: it is constantly at work educating the spirit of the age, conjuring up the forms in which the age is most lacking. The unsatisfied yearning of the artist reaches back to the primordial image in the unconscious which is best fitted to compensate the inadequacy and one-sidedness of the present. The artist seizes on this image, and in raising it from deepest unconsciousness he brings it into relation with conscious values, thereby transforming it until it can be accepted by the minds of his contemporaries according to their powers.<\/span><br><br>Although when you consider what is being produced today I am not sure if the definition holds true.

There have always been two sides to art, one commercial and one at the frontier of innovation. Commercial art is forgotten by time and we basically solely talk about the latter side.<br>Innovation in art is usually entirely related to new techniques, and they are brought about by pioneers. Literally all known painters or musicians were absolute pioneers in what they did. It doesn\u2019t really matter how exactly: it matters that they were. The artists who simply replicated others were, again, forgotten by time.<br><br>Now, before the beginning of the 20th century, all the innovations were slowly building a canon of beauty: art was supposed to please the most the human eye\/year. What each author did before this period was getting closer to this ideal of perfect beauty little by little through new techniques. What happened, you might ask, then? Well, the \u201claws\u201d of what makes something beautiful were found and thoroughly explored already. From this moment onwards, to do something fully respecting the canon of beauty was to be like those artists who just replicate others and are forgotten by time.","filename":"John Grimshaw","ext":".png","w":908,"h":580,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":79,"tim":1492743088594,"time":1492743088,"md5":"V\/2k7Y\/qSYBJf930YKt8Qg==","fsize":1053514,"resto":122078505,"id":"YJkOyVF\/","country":"PT","country_name":"Portugal"},{"no":122085165,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)22:51:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122078649\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122078649<\/a><br>&quot;shock&quot; takes no talent.","time":1492743095,"resto":122078505,"id":"MokCB7gh","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122085242,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)22:52:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122085152\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122085152<\/a><br>Think of painters like John Grimshaw, Ivan Aivazovski or Albert Bierstadt, for instance, and you see that their works are near perfection when it comes to landscapes and urban scenes. Hence, painting them after 1900 became a clich\u00e9, kitsch and something nobody would be remembered for. And yet, these are still largely forgotten, as what they are doing is already not that innovative.<br><br>So, what\u2019s happening in arts is that every artist is trying to create or belong to a new movement because not to do so is to be thrown into the trash bin of history even before your career is over. The point is to gain a name for yourself. In other words, what happened in the beginning of the 20th century was a large abandonment of the canon of beauty towards something else \u2013 anything else, actually. And they embraced the opposite. They started with surreal and largely non-representative art, which still somewhat followed the canon of beauty. But slowly it got more political, more mathematical, more anti-beauty. By the 60s, all traditional forms of art were largely abandoned, and modern musical compositions were a mess of dissonance and mathematical tricks; sculpture and painting were supposed to \u201cmake you think\u201d about some social topic; and the more it shocked people and the uglier it was the better.","filename":"Bierstadt","ext":".png","w":948,"h":576,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":75,"tim":1492743133105,"time":1492743133,"md5":"6PPoAvvTMByjO7j92RAUJQ==","fsize":1422459,"resto":122078505,"id":"YJkOyVF\/","country":"PT","country_name":"Portugal"},{"no":122085405,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)22:53:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122083716\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122083716<\/a><br>The people are a mix of awesome and horribly pretentious and crazy.

There are some artists who are really sane and approach their work as a craft, calmly, thoughtfully, etc. They&#039;re socially normal and down to earth, kind, good people. However there are also the &quot;artists&quot; who are just lunatics looking for attention and a way to justify acting out their baggage. Those people, I think, would remain liberal regardless of the culture. When I think about it, there&#039;s also a third category, which is the seemingly sane hippie type -- especially older female hippies -- who act calm and their art isn&#039;t very challenging but really they&#039;re raging angry feminists on the inside. So they would remain liberal too.<br><br>I guess that&#039;s a long way of saying that the ones who make art because they&#039;re truly creative and imaginative wouldn&#039;t necessarily default to liberalism in a different cultural context, but that the ones who make art because they&#039;re damaged goods and they&#039;ve latched onto art as salvation would probably remain libs.<br><br>Wild speculation on my part, but that&#039;s how I see it.","time":1492745551,"resto":122078505,"id":"PVxV8qxt","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122089805,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)23:32:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122078505\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122078505<\/a><br>EUROPEANS make no art","time":1492745574,"resto":122078505,"id":"+iQcvd5P","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122090005,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)23:34:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122089501\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122089501<\/a><br><a href=\"#p122089743\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122089743<\/a><br>Beautiful, love it.

I think we should only admit individuals who<br><br>-join our military for a minimum 10 years (because they will absolutely be as or more productive than our own citizenry)<br>-have a doctorate in STEM (arts not needed unless fine arts or an actual art form, none of this &quot;modern art period chicken&quot; shit)<br>-are labor in an undersupplied market (such as doctors)<br><br>and even then are willing to live in a designated place (like not the good ones, they have to go live in shitty bumfuck nowhere and los angeles) for a certain period of time (exception: military).<br><br>Why? Because if they want to immigrate to our country, they only get to come for the freedoms, not free stuff. If we admit them, they better be worthwhile.<br><br>Should we enforce our existing laws on illegal immigrants? Yes, for the simple reason that we are a country. We have laws; laws only mean something when they are enforced continuously, with a concerted effort to follow the intent of the lawmakers. We have in effect laws that stipulate that our country has a border with mexico. Mexicans are not Americans. They are Mexicans. If even Mexico has a wall at it&#039;s southern border, why can&#039;t the U.S.? They deport; they track; why shouldn&#039;t we? It&#039;s a rather obvious conclusion when you look at it logically.","time":1493940313,"resto":124127039,"id":"V2FuVE+5","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

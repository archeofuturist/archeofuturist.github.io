I am 20 years old. The conversation shifted into children and whatnot, and several of the girls said that they did not want to have kids, but rather they would adopt. What is this?

What can be done about this degeneracy?","filename":"IMG_3941","ext":".jpg","w":240,"h":240,"tn_w":240,"tn_h":240,"tim":1492631593651,"time":1492631593,"md5":"xwmyA5kh6p2CHS3uiSFJ2g==","fsize":58227,"resto":0,"id":"kqXQMxb7","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"ew-omg-yeah-im-never-having-babies","country_name":"United States","replies":6,"images":1,"unique_ips":6},{"no":121889174,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)16:12:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121886784\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121886784<\/a><br>In my country we have a saying it goes a little something like this why would you bother to pick up the Apple when you can just buy one but we also fuck those in our country so I wouldn&#039;t trust everything that comes out of our mouths","time":1492632747,"resto":121886784,"id":"VGsviH6Z","country":"IQ","country_name":"Iraq"},{"no":121889334,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)16:13:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121886784\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121886784<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;college basketball game<\/span><br><br>stopped reading there","time":1492632818,"resto":121886784,"id":"9KAEnCw2","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121889438,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)16:14:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121889334\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121889334<\/a><br>baseball buddy. clearly you hadnt even started reading","time":1492632865,"resto":121886784,"id":"kqXQMxb7","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121889878,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)16:17:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121886784\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121886784<\/a><br>Adopting brown children is seen as a positive thing.

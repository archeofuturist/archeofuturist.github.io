Because it would be a yuge win for Trump. It will silence a whole lot of critics who said he was too naive or inexperienced to get things done on the foreign stage, and it&#039;ll make a hell of a lot of his supporters happy. Even if Trump fails in everything else he does as POTUS, he&#039;ll be remembered just for getting the wall built, and getting Mexico to pay for it.<br><br>So if I were Mexican President I&#039;d work out $30 billion worth of stuff I want from the US, and then demand that from Trump in exchange for spending $25 billion on the wall.<br><br>Once again Australia is smarter than world leaders.<br><br>Pic unrelated","filename":"dh8mqDbcenm42RPrtaFM1TxjLTrSvmBJL3ftEyBx8zs","ext":".jpg","w":560,"h":313,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":139,"tim":1492585285160,"time":1492585285,"md5":"aKqiC8DAimUfXvS8FjAQsQ==","fsize":23045,"resto":0,"id":"Co5TuFKr","country":"AU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"why-doesnt-the-mexican-president-agree-to-pay-for","country_name":"Australia","replies":2,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":121816844,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)03:10:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"Mexico doesn&#039;t want our help","time":1492585849,"resto":121816205,"id":"VsT1qAH9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121816929,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)03:12:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"Because Mexicans are stupid and their president is just a puppet.","time":1492585922,"resto":121816205,"id":"EWrRxo7q","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

Mexico agrees to pay for it, IF America gives good trade concessions to Mexico, agrees to assist in dealing with Mexican drug cartels, agree to import certain products that are made in Mexico but also other countries, but only import them from Mexico (or have a lower tariff on Mexico than other countries), etc.<br><br>Why would Trump be willing to give all these concessions? Because it would be a yuge win for Trump. It will silence a whole lot of critics who said he was too naive or inexperienced to get things done on the foreign stage, and it&#039;ll make a hell of a lot of his supporters happy. Even if Trump fails in everything else he does as POTUS, he&#039;ll be remembered just for getting the wall built, and getting Mexico to pay for it.<br><br>So if I were Mexican President I&#039;d work out $30 billion worth of stuff I want from the US, and then demand that from Trump in exchange for spending $25 billion on the wall.<br><br>Once again Australia is smarter than world leaders.<br><br>Pic unrelated","filename":"dh8mqDbcenm42RPrtaFM1TxjLTrSvmBJL3ftEyBx8zs","ext":".jpg","w":560,"h":313,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":139,"tim":1492585285160,"time":1492585285,"md5":"aKqiC8DAimUfXvS8FjAQsQ==","fsize":23045,"resto":0,"id":"Co5TuFKr","country":"AU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"why-doesnt-the-mexican-president-agree-to-pay-for","country_name":"Australia","replies":21,"images":2,"unique_ips":13},{"no":121816844,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)03:10:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"Mexico doesn&#039;t want our help","time":1492585849,"resto":121816205,"id":"VsT1qAH9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121816929,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)03:12:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"Because Mexicans are stupid and their president is just a puppet.","time":1492585922,"resto":121816205,"id":"EWrRxo7q","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121817832,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)03:25:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121816205\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121816205<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Why doesn&#039;t the Mexican President agree to pay<\/span><br><br>No Pesos.<br>http:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2017\/01\/04\/mexi<wbr>can-peso-hits-record-low-vs-dollar-<wbr>as-trump-trade-worries-heat-up.html<wbr>","time":1492586751,"resto":121816205,"id":"5X7ZweO\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121818710,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)03:39:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121816205\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121816205<\/a><br>Because it would be seen as weakness, for the rest of the world and specially the mexicans, Pe\u00f1a would be hanging from a tree if he agrees to pay for the wall.We macho m8<br><br>And of course it&#039;s a sovereignty issue, why the fuck we would pay for some one else&#039;s stuff?<br>Same with military aid, fuck off, we don&#039;t want you here.<br><br>If the U.S. fixes its problem of drug consumption, everything would be better.<br> <br><a href=\"#p121817832\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121817832<\/a><br>Trump&#039;s stupidity is actually making the peso stronger f\u00e4m<br>So you know... sad but true.","filename":"shay75","ext":".gif","w":297,"h":215,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":90,"tim":1492587582172,"time":1492587582,"md5":"EMEQzOERSftEawaS8mGoUA==","fsize":1161677,"resto":121816205,"id":"3EfD+vZX","country":"MX","country_name":"Mexico"},{"no":121818969,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)03:43:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121818710\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121818710<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;making the peso stronger<\/span><br><br>kek.<br>Australian heterosexuals.","time":1492587837,"resto":121816205,"id":"5X7ZweO\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121819412,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)03:50:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;trump asks mexico to pay for the wall<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;mexico won&#039;t pay shit<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;gets out of nafta<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;pay for the wall with the now taxed mexican products<\/span>","filename":"temertvyuri","ext":".png","w":852,"h":638,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1492588259187,"time":1492588259,"md5":"dOpxY3FPUcYFkdDTqdpBtw==","fsize":723364,"resto":121816205,"id":"+AO1HcUh","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":121819843,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)03:57:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121816205\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121816205<\/a><br>Its very easy mate : <br><br>Let say you live in a nice house beside a neighbor, and you want to build a wall IN YOUR LAND, and you ask your neighbor to pay for such wall, in this simple mental exercise, you can see his\/her answer from a mile away : <br><br>&quot;Go fuck yourself&quot;<br><br>Is any other country in the world (besides Sweden, of course) that is so cucked by its neighbor so its has to pay for other ones shit ?

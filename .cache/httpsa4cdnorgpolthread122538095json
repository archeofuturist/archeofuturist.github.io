The entertainment apparatus is integral to maintaining order in the US.<br><br>When people are distracted they don&#039;t ask questions. They inadvertently become completely subservient to their higher forces. With the onset of the internet and mass media the political theater of today has been allowed shifted towards a more entertainment geared approach. This is easily seen in the Trump vs. Hillary campaign, in which both candidates were more focused upon creating entertainment for their voters than establishing any concrete political identity. In twenty years presidential candidates will all be celebrities: actors, musicians, models, etc. The general public will welcome this change because of the entertainment value they&#039;re campaigns will hold. <br><br>Politicians are able to control people through these distractions - the unconscious goal of which is a subservient populace which is willing to elect easily manipulated figureheads in roles of power. This is the end state of any democracy, and is quickly followed by its inevitable collapse when its intelligentsia is eventually snuffed out altogether and the decadence which supports the political machine consumes itself. A lot of us will witness that in our lifetimes.","filename":"42490d319731b2d993cf414b30e426bc4ab5fcb150a7bec86cf4118d84df3cec","ext":".jpg","w":5344,"h":3776,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":88,"tim":1493006811545,"time":1493006811,"md5":"nWv3yEbJZ+j7SCP5n6zZUw==","fsize":3070148,"resto":122538095,"id":"k+kYNGd1","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"}]}

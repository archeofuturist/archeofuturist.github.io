We currently have single-payer for some people, Medicare, and Medicaid. These are more cost efficient than private insurance. Fine, but even with that health is 20% of the U.S. budget AND 20% of GDP. If we took over 20% of GDP in a 17 trillion dollar economy, even with improved efficiency, isn&#039;t that a spending increase close to equal the ENTIRE current government budget of 4 trillion?<br><br>Am I missing something? Is U.S. government revenue comparatively low for our GDP? Is single-payer THAT much more efficient?","filename":"4535","ext":".jpg","w":900,"h":904,"tn_w":248,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492810624450,"time":1492810624,"md5":"86TmMeTXZ7wGQVCAsDM+Lw==","fsize":265021,"resto":0,"id":"V4T7MPk0","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"us-healthcare-debate","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":1,"unique_ips":2},{"no":122190082,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)17:43:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"Bump.

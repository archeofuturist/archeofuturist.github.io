I&#039;m missing a few things I still think, so any clarification would be great:<br><br>General rundown of USA missile attack on Syria:<br><br>The USA attack on the Syrian airbase was in retaliation for the alleged chemical weapon attack carried about by Assad. The attack was designed by Mattis, and was an example of Trump flexing his muscle in the Syrian conflict in order to signal that chemical weapons usage would be met with coordinated retaliation. This signal went out to Assad and the (((rebels))) alike.<br><br>The chemical weapons attack carried out by Assad is not confirmed by independent investigators (UN), and very well could have been a false flag of sorts. The attack did happen and it was Assad&#039;s forces, however the details of the attack are where contention is currently at. Russia and Syria claim that it was an attack against a terrorist weapons cache, while the l\u00fcgenpresse claims that Assad used chemical weapons against his own citizens and killed many children in the attack.<br><br>The long term affects are still up in the air, however Russia is now ramping up defensive infrastructure support in Syria, possibly with aims to end the conflict in a more timely manner. Russia is also sending a force towards the ship that the USA launched the missile strike from. The event took place during discussions with Xi Jingping; a large component of these investigations involve North Korea. The USA muscle flexing in Syria signals a heightened willingness to engage in military conflict, which may lead the Chinese to be less favorable of North Korea&#039;s antagonism. Also, Russia&#039;s increased defensive presence in Syria may very well prevent further Israeli involvement.","filename":"1489760037620","ext":".jpg","w":607,"h":608,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":124,"tim":1491584706032,"time":1491584706,"md5":"zunEF+jvtliuqX12gDLGZg==","fsize":37350,"resto":119973890,"id":"YjPZG6ti","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119982856,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)13:05:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119981500\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119981500<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;rebels<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;demoralized by limited chem strike against civilians <\/span><br><br>This just fans their flames, gives them stronger recruiting power, and invites in the US to provide them air cover. <br><br>any rational person knows this.<br>Assad&#039;s war has been nothing if not logical and brutal.","time":1491584730,"resto":119973890,"id":"TicAflIN","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119983104,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)13:07:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119982800\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119982800<\/a><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=0-J<wbr>A1ffd5Ms","time":1491584831,"resto":119973890,"id":"vSvBgTZV","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119983546,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)13:09:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119982800\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119982800<\/a><br>The worst thing is that if it was a false flag, there&#039;s no way of knowing who.

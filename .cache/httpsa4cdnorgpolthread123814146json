Indeed, Stephens even quotes the New York Times\u2019 own environmental reporter, Andrew Revkin, who has observed that he \u201csaw a widening gap between what scientists had been learning about global warming and what advocates were claiming as they pushed ever harder to pass climate legislation.\u201d","filename":"1492909126688","ext":".png","w":1536,"h":1024,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1493762043365,"time":1493762043,"md5":"Vm8GMHPUSalexmGMkxanOw==","fsize":2206291,"resto":123814146,"id":"IjaofuAM","country":"AU","m_img":1,"country_name":"Australia"},{"no":123825644,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)17:54:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123825256\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123825256<\/a><br>Dude, I&#039;m talking about coal mostly.","time":1493762084,"resto":123814146,"id":"a\/a7qvFy","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123825902,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)17:56:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123825481\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123825481<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Or just avoid fault lines and areas prone to tsunamis.<\/span><br>Oh so we can only build in the white areas and everywhere else just won&#039;t have electricity because you can only transmit so much so far?<br><br>Again, you don&#039;t know shit.

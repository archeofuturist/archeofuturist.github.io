Tom couldn\u2019t deal with the family stress and departed for Africa where he worked as an archaeologist of sorts. Hugh and Stefan were left to deal with their mother. Hortence spent her days sleeping with various men, one of which molested Stefan. When Stefan tried to run away, his mother beat him. Hortence viewed her children as objects; existing purely for her enjoyment. She loved the attention that her two blonde-blue eyed boys brought to her. This was significant in the development of her children\u2019s narcissism.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Stefan longed to see his Father. When he was 16 he traveled to Africa to spend the summer with him. He had sucked his thumb to fall asleep his entire life until spending his first night in Tom\u2019s home.

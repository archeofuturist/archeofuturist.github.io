What happened in Russia and China were so centralized because they were literally in a backwards feudal society. They weren&#039;t industrialized and largely illiterate and superstitious. We don&#039;t live in those conditions. The point is worker ownership over the means of production. So for a 21st century first world communism the economic model wouldn&#039;t be based on state ownership over the economy (which is amazing for building up third world countries into industrialized ones) but on the worker co-operative and making the workplace into a democracy where every person gets the full value of what they produce.","time":1491725313,"resto":120255576,"id":"yQfaeQ9c","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120257771,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)04:08:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120255827\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120255827<\/a><br>Commendable memeage lad","time":1491725332,"resto":120255576,"id":"1Fi7ezYc","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120257782,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)04:08:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120256829\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120256829<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;FREE MARKET COMMUNISM<\/span><br>Capitalism BTFO","filename":"FREEMARKETCOMMUNISM","ext":".png","w":1315,"h":493,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":46,"tim":1491725339769,"time":1491725339,"md5":"2EOcs6JGtzJqw1HQ\/LotvA==","fsize":88721,"resto":120255576,"id":"rgaxNX+L","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":120257826,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)04:09:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120256829\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120256829<\/a><br>lol, did you ever work in big factory of some kind? you can do shit like that when you run a small cafeteria in alternative part of town.

What happened in Russia and China were so centralized because they were literally in a backwards feudal society. They weren&#039;t industrialized and largely illiterate and superstitious. We don&#039;t live in those conditions. The point is worker ownership over the means of production. So for a 21st century first world communism the economic model wouldn&#039;t be based on state ownership over the economy (which is amazing for building up third world countries into industrialized ones) but on the worker co-operative and making the workplace into a democracy where every person gets the full value of what they produce.","time":1491725313,"resto":120255576,"id":"yQfaeQ9c","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120257771,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)04:08:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120255827\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120255827<\/a><br>Commendable memeage lad","time":1491725332,"resto":120255576,"id":"1Fi7ezYc","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120257782,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)04:08:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120256829\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120256829<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;FREE MARKET COMMUNISM<\/span><br>Capitalism BTFO","filename":"FREEMARKETCOMMUNISM","ext":".png","w":1315,"h":493,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":46,"tim":1491725339769,"time":1491725339,"md5":"2EOcs6JGtzJqw1HQ\/LotvA==","fsize":88721,"resto":120255576,"id":"rgaxNX+L","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":120257826,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)04:09:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120256829\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120256829<\/a><br>lol, did you ever work in big factory of some kind? you can do shit like that when you run a small cafeteria in alternative part of town.

A handful of people, owners and shareholders, make all the decisions. As I&#039;ve explained all these bosses make money off of surplus extraction. It&#039;s how CEOs of big companies can make $5000\/h doing nothing but reviewing stocks on their yacht. <br><br>So, starting in the 1970s the capitalists realized something. Why stay in Western Europe, North America and Japan, where the wages are high and unions are stronger, and go to places like Southeast Asia where the wages are much much lower. This started the exodus, and it&#039;s the reason everything you own is made overseas. Because it&#039;s much more profitable to make it there and ship it back. Jobs that did stay started to become automated, further lowering the need to improve wages. Production skyrocketed, wages stayed the same or got worse and the capitalist class was swimming in so much money they don&#039;t know what to do with it. They put it in offshore banks where trillions of dollars sits untouched and untaxed, and even more importantly realized that they could *lend* the extra money they weren&#039;t paying in wages and taxes to the governments and banks. With interest. It&#039;s the perfect scam. You&#039;ve seen the memes saying &quot;the world is trillions of dollars in debt, who are they in debt to?&quot; They&#039;re in debt to private companies. Companies that was, again, able to lend out the money they didn&#039;t pay in wages and taxes on interest. Capitalism is a slave system. 6 people own half the wealth in the entire world due to this process of surplus exploitation. <br><br>And let&#039;s talk about automation. Pretend you&#039;re the private owner of a business and you employ 10 people. You buy a new robot that does the job of 8 people, what will you do?

Because worker co-operatives don&#039;t function for capital accumulation like private business does, it works quite different. If this 10 man business was a worker co-operative where the means of production is run democratically by all the workers themselves, and they decided to introduce a robot that does the job of 8 people what would happen? They wouldn&#039;t fire any of the people but cut down hours. If the robot does the work of 8, the work of the last 2 can be split between all 10 people resulting in a massively reduced work day with no loss of productivity. You would be making the same money you did (or better) with less than half the work. <br><br>And the jobs won&#039;t leave. Under private ownership the owners are incentivized to leave to the place with the lowest wages. Under co-operative ownership the purpose is to enchance human life. If 10 people work in a co-operative and one person says &quot;let us go to Asia where I can pay workers cents on the dollar, fire all of you and hoard the wealth&quot; clearly he will be outvoted. No one will vote their jobs away. <br><br>And worker co-operatives have been scientifically shown to produce more, hire more and lead to better job security. And which would you rather work? 42 hour weekdays being dictated to by a boss while getting a fraction of what you produce or a 15 hour week where you have a vote and a say in your job and gain back the profits you produced? The option should be absolutely clear. And when the general public catches onto this model, and they will, communism is gonna surge back like a wildfire.

There is no late stage capitalism. People will always do something to obtain what they want. In the ussr a black market was formed but it was a market none the less. If you&#039;re using gaudy designer clothes as an example of postmodernist social decay then sure you have a case i guess. It&#039;s cherry picking at best though. Most actual designer stuff outside of haute couture is conservative as hell. Think Ralph Lauren, or Gucci or Chanel or Jimmy Choo or even less mainstream people like Helmut Lang or Ann D. <br><br>What you&#039;re experiencing or noting is social decay. I&#039;d argue Marxists have been trying to do this forever. Since the 1910s. Postmodernism is a rejection of the objective and of standards of any sort because they&#039;re oppressive. And so you get dumbass stained jeans, menstrual blood paintings, and 682672485 genders. <br><br>Blame those retards. Don&#039;t blame markets. Markets respond to society. Markets do not dictate society. What you&#039;re seeing is only because people want it or people let it happen. The society is what is late stage. Keep going down the path of weakness and were doomed.","time":1493142393,"resto":122758824,"id":"n4vz14KU","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122761837,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)13:50:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122761318\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122761318<\/a><br>Its \/leftypol\/ <br>Same shit with nigress and white man threads","time":1493142640,"resto":122758824,"id":"io+k4S3E","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":122762102,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)13:52:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122759357\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122759357<\/a><br>Do you?

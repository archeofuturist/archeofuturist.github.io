When the airplane takes off in the direction opposite to earth rotation in the initial condition the plane and earth both rotate at 1040 mph. The plane then start to accelerate opposite the rotational speed, where it gains a speed say 200 mph at take off. Even then, the plane&#039;s net speed is 1040 mph - 200 mph = 840 mph into the direction of earth rotation. And when the plane enters flight it maintains that net speed of 840 mph in the rotational direction regardless of what its speed is relative to earth surface. We don&#039;t feel our current velocity, in the same sense as we feel acceleration, since acceleration is tied with force contrary to velocity.

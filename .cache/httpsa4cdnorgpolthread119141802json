Now obviously since it&#039;s an atomic test it&#039;s not suddenly going to pop out of the ground mounted to a death robot and charge into Seoul. <br><br>However some are worried that this test may be a bridge too far and require more than just &#039;deep concern&#039; as a response.<br><br>If the North does conduct an atomic test, even if it is small yield what should the response be? You could interpret this test as a direct challenge to the current administration. Quite literally &quot;Rook, I did it. Come at me, bro.&quot; Trump will really be on the spot to do something that stings like fuck to the regime but at the same time won&#039;t provoke it into doing something stupid.<br><br>For all we know it might even be a case of the Kim regime backing down and there won&#039;t be a test at all. They&#039;ve backed down before.<br><br>Thoughts?","filename":"bestkorea","ext":".jpg","w":800,"h":624,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":195,"tim":1491019572966,"time":1491019572,"md5":"4AHF+reU6ERBlQIPPDg5oA==","fsize":538646,"resto":0,"id":"ak94\/rX7","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"north-korea-prepping-for-atomic-test","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":1,"unique_ips":3},{"no":119141930,"now":"04\/01\/17(Sat)00:07:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119141802\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119141802<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;implying they haven&#039;t done tests before<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;implying you are not baiting their propaganda<\/span>","time":1491019638,"resto":119141802,"id":"PH+CFIKW","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119142531,"now":"04\/01\/17(Sat)00:13:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"Global Thermonuclear War?

Mulders contradicted interpretations of his research by some media outlets, which claimed that Hitler definitely had Jewish ancestry. Mulders commented:<br><br>I never wrote that Hitler was a Jew, or that he had a Jewish grandfather. I only wrote that Hitler&#039;s haplogroup is E1b1b, being more common among Berbers, Somalian people and Jews than among overall Germans. This, in order to convey that he was not exactly what during the Third Reich would have been called &#039;Aryan.&#039; All the rest are speculations of journalists who didn&#039;t even take the trouble to read my article, although I had it translated into English especially for this purpose.&quot;[63]<br><br>The accuracy of some of the coverage arising from this study was questioned.

The debate point is really worth noting, because you can observe someone who is \/pol\/ approved and actually quite willing to engage in debate. Take Jordan Peterson for example. He&#039;s had the balls to go at it with Sam Harris, a professional debater, twice. Do you think Sargon would be willing to take on that kind of risk to his reputation when instead he can just continually take easy positions like &quot;human rights need to be respected&quot; or &quot;communism is bad&quot; and then say &quot;huhuhu these feminists are so salty huhuhu&quot;","time":1491655462,"resto":120123804,"id":"QEZNci4h","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

Why has Nickelback been targeted for such hatred? It&#039;s because they&#039;re 4 white males that promoted traditional values through their music. Now, I could just claim this, or I could give you evidence. Here are their first 3 singles from their debut album, &#039;Silver Side Up&#039;:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&#039;How You Remind Me&#039;: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=1cQ<wbr>h1ccqu8M<\/span><br><br>The number one most played song on U.S. radio of the 2000s.

And ever since, they&#039;ve been the victims of a targeted smear campaign. <br><br>An unconscious hate exists in the minds of our peers.

My eternal brother. My eternal Father, for Jesus Christ is the voice of God. Jesus Christ, The Word, who is God&#039;s voice like air coming out of the longs when you talk out loud. Jesus being The Voice Of God is literally God&#039;s voice turned into a person, the flesh. The Potter&#039;s clay.<br><br>Verily that&#039;s how in the beginning The Word was with God and was God. How it is God. Is your voice not a part of your free will when you talk? Therefore verily verily I say unto you that don&#039;t you all see! Logically by default! For it is also written that they all have no excuse for GOD IS THERE. GOD EXISTS. THERE&#039;S NO EXCUSE YE OF ATHEIST! <br><br>Anyway.<br><br>Oh mustard seed, mustard seed! Oh how I see thou! And you know I love thee! And the angels sang and He said you pleased Him!<br>Oh Faith, Faith! It is the way I became save from breaking The Law Of God. <br><br>This in it&#039;s typing, though digital form, verily verily I pray, with all my heart and all my mind, in the name of God, Jesus Christ, let it be known. Let It Be Known, That Which We Have Known Since The Beginning. That We In The Body Of Jesus Christ Become As Known, One With God. Oh the Baptism, how important art thou. Likened unto the peak of my faith.<br><br>I pray all this even in reading form in Jesus Name Amen. For when we ask in Jesus name, Jesus is the voice of God. Is Jesus Christ not also THE NAME OF GOD ALSO KNOWN YEA, AS JEHOVAH? Though some say Yahweh, and Elohim, All who know, He who said, &quot;Tell them I AM sent me,&quot; through Jesus Christ may enter the door.","filename":"The Holy Spirit Is God&#039;s Spirit.

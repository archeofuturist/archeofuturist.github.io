This is an important release, because the ZeroNet proxy at bit.no.com that we&#039;ve relied upon since getting banned from the Google Store is going away on 4\/30. To get around this we now use IPFS and other ZeroNet proxies as data sources.<br><br>People who do not upgrade to the new version will cease to get list updates, so please spread the word and let people know that a new version is out.<br><br>Also, the Firefox version has been brought up to feature parity with the Chrome version, minor bugs have been fixed, and small UI improvements have been made.<br><br>Please let people on Twitter and elsewhere know.<br><br>**Thank You**","time":1492777593,"resto":122128828,"id":"AMvdmBV5","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

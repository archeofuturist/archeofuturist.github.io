You told me the Eastern Orthodox were conservative, all about values, and the real church of Christ. And what do I see at a service?

Are there actually any churches where the men seem to know something about the bible beyond that Jesus is somehow important and where the regular female attendees don&#039;t dress like protestant whores?

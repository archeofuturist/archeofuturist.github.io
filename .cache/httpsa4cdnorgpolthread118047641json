The sick, twisted, barbaric, and uncivilized radical Islamic terrorists who cheer for terror and applaud when the victims rest bloody on the ground in London.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;There\u2019s still bodies on the floor and the radicals are already celebrating. What does that tell you about their people?<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;As news was breaking about the terror attack in London, the radicalized Muslims were simultaneously posting pictures celebrating the attack. Muslims were posting pictures with captions such as \u201callahu akbar\u201d and sharing photos of the attack as if it was a victory. What\u2019s their problem? Weren\u2019t they celebrating during 9\/11 too?<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;It\u2019s disgusting, but not shocking, to find evidence further supporting the Trump travel ban. At this point, I don\u2019t think America should even vet the people. Just ban them outright. Why take the chance? Look how their behavior is towards innocent victims. Is that what America is ready to welcome with open arms? Democrats are. Look how that\u2019s working out for them in other countries.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;A victory it is not, but a push further down the chain of civilization it very much is. They continue to prove why people don\u2019t trust them or want them around while also proving they are unable to civilize their population.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;If your religion celebrates hurting innocent people, then it\u2019s time to find a new religion. There\u2019s no point to be part of a culture that thrives on the harm of the innocent. If the people attacked today in London were all guilty of killing a Muslim person, then I could understand how the attack was justified. This is nothing more than a terrorist attack that does nothing. It literally accomplishes nothing. There are no virgins in the sky waiting for anyone who commits an act like this.<\/span>","filename":"Absolutely Disgusting","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":450,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1490333934177,"time":1490333934,"md5":"xvxKqLEIJQLs+iJmMmi\/7A==","fsize":96548,"resto":0,"id":"sxZKU0zF","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"i-hope-the-uk-and-other-eu-nations-finally-wake","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

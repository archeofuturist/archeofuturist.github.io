And I realized I&#039;d be doing myself a disservice, there&#039;s nothing wrong with any of these things. Trump put America first america is Strong again. He did good. THey came before and tried to divide us when Trump said he would support israel too.. Israel is the good guys it&#039;s the libby jews we have to worry about here at home. Israel wants the same thing we want. <br><br>THings turned out to be alright. Before that we freaked out about the healthcare he seemed like he wasn&#039;t going to remove it but now he&#039;s made it clear he is going to do exactly that<br><br>He also is still intent on the wall too. There&#039;s nothing we should abandon him over actually He&#039;s doing a pretty good Job. It&#039;s all Obama&#039;s fault desu but Trump will figure out this deep state stuff eventually and we won&#039;t stop winning","filename":"Whedonesque-4384748","ext":".jpg","w":400,"h":300,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1491543613714,"time":1491543613,"md5":"\/yn9VVL5yiYzB+8uryaNGw==","fsize":12728,"resto":0,"id":"YVW3ICpO","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"hey-i-was-freaking-out-just-like-you","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

Importing lots of people into a country obviously would drive the wages in that country down, but if the alternative is having one country where the wages are high and a bunch of others where they are low, it&#039;s only fair to give all people a chance to compete. Being born in a privileged country doesn&#039;t entitle you to a good job - your skills do (at least they should).<br><br>Besides, if you ban immigration completely, the only consequence will be that the major companies will entirely move production somewhere else where more people willing to work for less. You essentially end up with the same result, the only difference being the whole basic human rights thing.","time":1490970828,"resto":119058029,"id":"ETJ1nNLf","country":"HR","country_name":"Croatia"},{"no":119061161,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)10:34:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119060548\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119060548<\/a><br>You&#039;re welcome to try that, but it won&#039;t work because that&#039;s not enough to sustain immigrant cost of living in the US, nor the remittances they send to Mexico, forcing the workers to stay in mexico and work here instead.<br><br>Sounds like a good deal for us.<br><br><a href=\"#p119060503\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119060503<\/a><br>It&#039;s got the same effect as raising it to 50$\/h","time":1490970875,"resto":119058029,"id":"eH+t14nY","country":"MX","country_name":"Mexico"},{"no":119061162,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)10:34:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119060755\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119060755<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I deserve the lowest paid labor possible even if that labor is illegal and exploited like a modern slave population<\/span><br><br>Ie employer welfare","time":1490970876,"resto":119058029,"id":"FxAVbQ1d","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119061163,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)10:34:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119058029\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119058029<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;If you can be replaced by someone with no previous education that can&#039;t speak the language, you don&#039;t deserve to have a job<\/span><br>It&#039;s really easy to get replaced by someone who offers to work for a 1\/3 of price despite their lack of qualifications.","time":1490970877,"resto":119058029,"id":"nBEQglvZ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119061167,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)10:34:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119058029\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119058029<\/a><br>&quot;If you had a manual labor job you&#039;re a piece of shit and it&#039;s really cool to pay brown people nothing to do these jobs.&quot; - modern day liberals","time":1490970879,"resto":119058029,"id":"5mvkalF4","country":"KR","country_name":"South Korea"},{"no":119061348,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)10:37:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119059807\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119059807<\/a><br><span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;8<\/span>.50 an hour<br>holy shit sign me up!!","time":1490971020,"resto":119058029,"id":"O28k6H7f","country":"MX","country_name":"Mexico"},{"no":119061373,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)10:37:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119061161\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119061161<\/a><br>Nope<br><br>Ridiculously high min wage = mass unemployment<br><br>Ridiculously low min wage = mass enslavement<br><br><br>Leave it to Mexicans to be drooling idiots about the economy","time":1490971038,"resto":119058029,"id":"FxAVbQ1d","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119061418,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)10:37:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119061161\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119061161<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;but it won&#039;t work because that&#039;s not enough to sustain immigrant cost of living in the US, nor the remittances they send to Mexico, forcing the workers to stay in mexico<\/span><br>Yeah you&#039;re starting to get it, we don&#039;t want low-wage illegals as a workforce PERIOD, only greedy companies who don&#039;t give a fuck want you here.","filename":"This Is It sign","ext":".jpg","w":604,"h":394,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":81,"tim":1490971073507,"time":1490971073,"md5":"IXRfAt22YgRtLTey\/5FkKw==","fsize":38152,"resto":119058029,"id":"dgYnA+h3","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119061438,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)10:38:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119061162\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119061162<\/a><br><a href=\"#p119060608\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119060608<\/a><br>You&#039;re not entitled to high living standards out of my pocket.

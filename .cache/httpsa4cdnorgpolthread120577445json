And now Dina Powell is U.S. Deputy National Security Advisor for Strategy to Donald Trump. <br><br>Dina Powell&#039;s husband is Richard Powell, president of Teneo, which has close ties to the Clinton Foundation -- Bill Clinton served as an advisor for Teneo. <br><br>Now take Jared Kushner, who took a $250m loan from George Soros. This is not even to mention Gary Cohn yet. <br><br>These are the people who got Flynn removed, and now they&#039;re going for Bannon. It&#039;s a fight for influence over Trump. <br><br>I am working on an OC piece showing the connections and tying it all together. <br><br>Everything I have said is verifiable, google the following:<br>&quot;Ivanka Trump Huma Abedin&quot;<br>&quot;Ivanka Trump Chelsea Clinton&quot;<br>&quot;Ivanka Trump Dina Powell&quot;<br>&quot;Dina Powell Gary Cohn&quot; <br>&quot;Dina Powell Valerie Jarrett&quot;<br>&quot;Jared Kushner George Soros&quot; <br>&quot;Teneo Clintons&quot;<br>&quot;Teneo Clinton Foundation&quot;<br>&quot;Richard Powell Clintons&quot;<br><br>Jared Kushner is STILL a registered democrat<br><br>All of these people are higher higher (yes I said it twice, they are way up there) ups at Goldmans, and globalists, and they&#039;ve been brought in by Jared Kushner and Ivanka, why do you think #FireKushner was trending? <br><br>Like I said, I am working on a brainstorm bubble plot showing all the connections<br><br>Google everything I said and you will find I am not wrong. Fuck this Syria strike, I might even agree with it for political posturing reasons, but google what I said and you will find the subversion. <br><br>The moment Bannon quits or is booted we know it&#039;s over. We can&#039;t lose this fight. We have to fight.<br><br>It&#039;s literally globalism vs nationalism and Bannon is one of the only people on our side.","filename":"Trump Washington","ext":".png","w":571,"h":644,"tn_w":110,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491904132083,"time":1491904132,"md5":"1pN+JEP4ECwz5ffX35D3hA==","fsize":729030,"resto":120577445,"id":"YbFoPwIO","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120579408,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)05:49:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120578389\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120578389<\/a><br>this one Austrian is here again, are you actually Austrian or do you just use a proxy to shitpost loudly?","filename":"eternal-leaf","ext":".jpg","w":458,"h":94,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":25,"tim":1491904179862,"time":1491904179,"md5":"3ohPtdYqYYa9EonLlcdS4g==","fsize":16353,"resto":120577445,"id":"T9mkOrLw","country":"AT","country_name":"Austria"},{"no":120579415,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)05:49:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120579011\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120579011<\/a><br><br>Honest question, why not Elizabeth Warren?<br>Is it because she&#039;s Bernie 2?","time":1491904186,"resto":120577445,"id":"pFriYOIs","country":"NZ","country_name":"New Zealand"},{"no":120579434,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)05:50:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120577445\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120577445<\/a><br><br>The only thing you didn&#039;t fuck up in this imnage is putting Rand Paul there.<br><br>Rand Paul is literally the only candidate worth voting for in the future..<br><br>DRUMPF is nothing more than a pathetic Israeli cocksucking cuck who makes everything his cunt daughter and his (((son-in-law))) tells him to.","time":1491904204,"resto":120577445,"id":"kQwkJ70B","country":"CZ","country_name":"Czech Republic"},{"no":120579445,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)05:50:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120578502\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120578502<\/a><br>Security curtain wall mixed with the aesthetics of the wire mesh one.<br><br>The Wall definitely needs to be a work of art.","time":1491904208,"resto":120577445,"id":"dindmugn","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120579447,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)05:50:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120579353\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120579353<\/a><br>kike lovers BTFO","filename":"1483622819348","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":500,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491904209683,"time":1491904209,"md5":"U5M84CvW9Ti61SnDt+47OQ==","fsize":34442,"resto":120577445,"id":"T7lahzZQ","country":"AT","country_name":"Austria"},{"no":120579485,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)05:50:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120578510\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120578510<\/a><br>Because urban Californians are retarded.<br>t. someone thay has to live around these calitards.","filename":"CQIflfW","ext":".jpg","w":1273,"h":717,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1491904245045,"time":1491904245,"md5":"Nbn5NlmgM3s2ba76bqnOaw==","fsize":183589,"resto":120577445,"id":"409Uu9JQ","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":120579490,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)05:50:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120579078\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120579078<\/a><br>Were you watching the &quot;live&quot; feed?<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Best Koreans drinking beer, giving statements, images showing off a palace-like hotel with servants all around, people smiling<\/span><br>By the little time I watched they seemed all pretty professional in that regard, I guess it&#039;s the habit.<br>I would say a few years under a de-programing around there should make miracles, I&#039;m not sure if they had solutions for the US grunts who went to the Korean war and got captured\/suffered brainwashing.<br>But it was the situation who made the training for the special forces - allegedly - start in the United States of America, with the waterboarding and so forth to soldiers\/special forces.","time":1491904250,"resto":120577445,"id":"P1hbMtm\/","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":120579516,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)05:51:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120579408\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120579408<\/a><br>Ich bin legitim du j\u00fcdischer Interessensvertreter und Fl\u00fcchtlingsfreund","time":1491904273,"resto":120577445,"id":"T7lahzZQ","country":"AT","country_name":"Austria"},{"no":120579525,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)05:51:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120579301\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120579301<\/a><br><br>Oprah wouldn&#039;t make it out of the primaries.<br><br><a href=\"#p120579301\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120579301<\/a><br><br>Kek, Oprah has a fan following.

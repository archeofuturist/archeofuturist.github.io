Jungles and deserts are not easy places for humans to live. Prior to colonial times Africa was very sparsely populated.<br><br>When Europeans arrived they were generally unable to move inland at all because of tropical diseases and hostile natives. The adaptations of the natives made them uniquely suitable for hard labor in tropical\/sub-tropical environments, so native prisoners were bought from local warlords and utilized to develop the agricultural base of the Americas. The African continent only opened up to Europe and the wider world after the moors were pushed back, so the African most people have come to know is relatively new from an anthropological standpoint.","time":1490139167,"resto":117685919,"id":"OfcWdl34","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117688291,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)19:40:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117685919\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117685919<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Why is Africa such a failed colonial continent?<\/span><br>It&#039;s because of the people who inhabit it.

Or to sacrifice so that our children would have it better. Freedom and responsibility, justice and duty; I think that those are these simple words will best describe the deep content, that the generation of war has refined to our heritage of values.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Finland knows its past. Finland governs the present and is ready to build the future. You can only build upon a strong foundation. Your heritage of values and your approach to life is a rock bottom, to which we are building our future. Your message will move forward to the next generations, that is a promise we&#039;ve made. \u2014 The history of our independence is not simplified in the thoughts of great men and women. Though history will not remember each and everyone of your names, your sacrifices and values will never be forgotten.&quot;<br><br>ITT: Post Suomi and ebin menes :--DDddd","filename":"finns are the most powerful race in the world","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":334,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":167,"tim":1493298397712,"time":1493298397,"md5":"5m5TL0\/vtb9e\/PKszOqLuA==","fsize":34521,"resto":0,"id":"KzZrjVub","country":"FI","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"finland-thread","country_name":"Finland","replies":24,"images":18,"unique_ips":11},{"no":123034212,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)09:07:29","name":"Anonymous","filename":"1478846691851","ext":".png","w":747,"h":624,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":104,"tim":1493298449309,"time":1493298449,"md5":"6JZAwEM\/Plb74fydt7gbQA==","fsize":175313,"resto":123034136,"id":"XDcHGvEb","country":"EE","country_name":"Estonia"},{"no":123034239,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)09:07:47","name":"Anonymous","filename":"1486045003903","ext":".jpg","w":466,"h":517,"tn_w":112,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493298467055,"time":1493298467,"md5":"B\/YNILK6OGIV8omnkEcSEg==","fsize":83915,"resto":123034136,"id":"XDcHGvEb","country":"EE","country_name":"Estonia"},{"no":123034272,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)09:08:06","name":"Anonymous","filename":"1493039744662","ext":".png","w":840,"h":1053,"tn_w":99,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493298486144,"time":1493298486,"md5":"ZQwoeYKzZ9SByavHeEX2pw==","fsize":116426,"resto":123034136,"id":"XDcHGvEb","country":"EE","country_name":"Estonia"},{"no":123034305,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)09:08:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"that&#039;s all I&#039;ve got","filename":"1486045062046","ext":".jpg","w":700,"h":450,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":80,"tim":1493298512575,"time":1493298512,"md5":"vluYgPaKakRPCuMfKtdqkw==","fsize":200595,"resto":123034136,"id":"XDcHGvEb","country":"EE","country_name":"Estonia"},{"no":123034313,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)09:08:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"homo pieru paska pillu :D","time":1493298517,"resto":123034136,"id":"ElE5DLr4","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":123034385,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)09:09:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123034313\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123034313<\/a><br><br>pieru homo nekru :D","filename":"pieru homo nekru","ext":".png","w":770,"h":565,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":91,"tim":1493298574537,"time":1493298574,"md5":"\/3OPNbqcEkdnFWVVfmsEGg==","fsize":65565,"resto":123034136,"id":"KzZrjVub","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":123034676,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)09:12:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"Finnish troops rise a flag to the common border of Finland, Sweden and Norway as the War on Lapland ends on 27th of April 1945.<br><br>Better picture than Iwo Jima desu","filename":"Kolmen_valtakunnan_rajapyykki_27.4.1945","ext":".png","w":425,"h":302,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":88,"tim":1493298770275,"time":1493298770,"md5":"\/jtPn\/S5Isch3Cm39irTNg==","fsize":142638,"resto":123034136,"id":"KzZrjVub","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":123035791,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)09:25:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"we were finns n shit gib neetbux plox<br>Also, can some finns post some cool finnish landscapes and cool unknown sights<br>also pls gib names of you towns so i could sperg in google maps<br>t. wants to travel through north-western russia and finland","time":1493299511,"resto":123034136,"id":"55fPm98V","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":123035861,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)09:25:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123034313\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123034313<\/a><br><a href=\"#p123034385\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123034385<\/a><br>Moi, haistaa paska, te kaiki vitun homo, pojat suomelaiset.

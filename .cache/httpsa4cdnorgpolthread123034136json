Or to sacrifice so that our children would have it better. Freedom and responsibility, justice and duty; I think that those are these simple words will best describe the deep content, that the generation of war has refined to our heritage of values.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Finland knows its past. Finland governs the present and is ready to build the future. You can only build upon a strong foundation. Your heritage of values and your approach to life is a rock bottom, to which we are building our future. Your message will move forward to the next generations, that is a promise we&#039;ve made. \u2014 The history of our independence is not simplified in the thoughts of great men and women.

Ever wondered why idea of worshiping your nation instead of God gained traction with stronger jewish influence? What a convinient way to weaken christianity! Just. In time to catch those not lured by communism. This is why nationalism fails. It is on itself a controled opossition.","filename":"2017-03-24-18-03-34--1262345763","ext":".jpg","w":280,"h":180,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":160,"tim":1490377719212,"time":1490377719,"md5":"WcIoaAXcOkb+pa29lp6A\/Q==","fsize":9712,"resto":0,"id":"hZ21Uris","country":"PL","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"nationalism","country_name":"Poland","replies":4,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":118106715,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)13:52:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118106349\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118106349<\/a><br>Read some Nietzsche lad<br>When you &quot;kill&quot; god, something else will rise to replace it. Sometimes it&#039;s nationalism, sometimes it&#039;s communism. No need to insert the kikes in the equation, it&#039;s simply what people do. You can&#039;t demolish the church and expect every person of your nation to &quot;create their own values and morals&quot;. You inadvertently push them to alternative &quot;religions&quot; (aka ideologies) that serve the same purpose: give an easy answer to every question of life and give meaning to life.","time":1490377926,"resto":118106349,"id":"+f2jfJCz","country":"GR","country_name":"Greece"},{"no":118107045,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)13:54:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118106715\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118106715<\/a><br>Also by saying <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;No need to insert the kikes in the equation<\/span><br>I meant that nationalism isn&#039;t a kike invention.

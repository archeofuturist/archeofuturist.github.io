Ever wondered why idea of worshiping your nation instead of God gained traction with stronger jewish influence? What a convinient way to weaken christianity! Just. In time to catch those not lured by communism. This is why nationalism fails. It is on itself a controled opossition.","filename":"2017-03-24-18-03-34--1262345763","ext":".jpg","w":280,"h":180,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":160,"tim":1490377719212,"time":1490377719,"md5":"WcIoaAXcOkb+pa29lp6A\/Q==","fsize":9712,"resto":0,"id":"hZ21Uris","country":"PL","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"nationalism","country_name":"Poland","replies":11,"images":1,"unique_ips":4},{"no":118106715,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)13:52:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118106349\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118106349<\/a><br>Read some Nietzsche lad<br>When you &quot;kill&quot; god, something else will rise to replace it.

The Russians murdered their own god at the start of the 20th century, and communism promptly ensued.

I don&#039;t see where nationalism fits in the equation. <br><br>I think I get what you mean, however, by your OP. Nationalism nowadays is presented as nothing else than the other side of the spectrum. Remember, however, that the basis of western nationalism is pretty much the teachings of Christianity: love and protect your tribe (only tribe is now your entire nation). After all, christianity was simply a guideline on how you and your tribe (nation) can survive. Nationalism (as a way of life, not a cancerous edgy ideology) is christianity without the metaphysical element.<br><br>Also checked","time":1490378655,"resto":118106349,"id":"+f2jfJCz","country":"GR","country_name":"Greece"},{"no":118108209,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)14:05:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118107565\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118107565<\/a><br>Exacly.

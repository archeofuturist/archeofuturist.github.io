Like a real fucking answer? Then shut the fuck up and listen for a second. What are wages and how are they derived? A wage is a share of profits in a company made by a projection of an employee&#039;s productivity. A company cannot raise wages in excess of projected profits nor can it lower them to levels that drive away potential workers. There&#039;s an ideal equalibrium between the three factors in question being wages, profits, and cost of living, and at the center of them all is production. Production is the cheif goal of a corporate venture. It is not the boss that pays the worker but the customer. The boss simply handles the money in between. In the united states there are many significant barriers to production, mostly oversight boards and unions that prevent increases in output and thus value. Consider for instance teachers unions and their effect on the quality of public education. Normally a poor educator would be dismissed from an educational institution. Teachers unions prevent this more often than not. Over time it decreses the output of the school in terms of real value. Furthermore the union will fight for higher or at least constant wages despite the slow decline in production. This causes an upset in the equalibrium of the trinity.

The fundamental theorems of welfare economics are very clear that one-time transfers of any sort result in equilibrium being established, though not the same equilibrium.

There is generally two definitions: minimum amount of money that your time\/labor is worth or minimum amount of money it takes to live a decent life if you work x hours a week (x being around 40 in America). Of course &quot;decent&quot; is a matter of perspective, but hopefully you get the idea. The first being more suited to the conservative view and the second being more liberal. An increase in minimum wage is generally followed with economic growth, but the downside is that companies have to handle paying more money to their employees (higher prices, lower amount of employees, lower business taxes, hope the economic growth will balance it out or a more even distribution of pay) all of which don&#039;t seem too likely. The more conservative view says that this will just have a null\/negative effect on the economy because it won&#039;t really change anything, just shuffle some money around. The more liberal viewpoint says that it will increase consumer spending which in turn can counteract the effect it has on businesses.","time":1490295922,"resto":117953545,"id":"2+eRbJIS","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117968754,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)15:06:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117967574\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117967574<\/a><br>This is statistically true. People lament that &quot;it isn&#039;t the 1950s anymore&quot; but don&#039;t realize half of what they mean is that they refuse to live like it is 1950: one or no television, no cable, no internet, no cellphones, cook everything, manage leftovers, preserve soup stocks, render fats, shower infrequently, and so on. In general, living like it is 1950 would save a lot of money.<br><br>Two problems.<br><br>One, statistically, accidents do happen, and people working to get ahead by definition do not have the resources available to manage this. Insurance can help to some extent but then prolongs the time necessary to get ahead. <br><br>Two, dwelling size is enormous compared to the &#039;50s, so paying for shelter in any form (rent, mortgage, rent-to-own) is much higher. So in one important way it is actually impossible to live like it is 1950. In my opinion it is this fact that is nearly completely responsible for the housing crash, other things being covariant with this underlying fact. This is a market failure. Good luck getting anyone to talk about it.<br><br>So to me the question is whether as a society we think it is worth managing catastrophes for people so that those who are earnestly trying to get ahead are not set back by forces more or less outside of their control. If so, the question is then how much we want to spend in order to be sure that our support only goes to &quot;the right&quot; people, whatever that means (catching cheaters is not free and it is definitely possible that it is cheaper to allow some cheating than to try to catch and punish them all).

A woman takes the social system as a given when making her decisions. Is your problem with the woman, or the social system, or both? Maybe when I asked the question above, you might think, &quot;It is neither. We can&#039;t really know what the right number of children are, except in hindsight, which is why people should be free to make their own choices.&quot;<br><br>Personally, I do not like state welfare, and do whatever I can as an individual, relative to other priorities, to eliminate it. But, in the meantime, it is there, and people will respond to their environment. It is difficult for me to sympathize with a white person who adopts a defeatist attitude thanks to affirmative action programs, while not sympathizing with a woman who elects to have a child thanks to the existence of welfare. Both are responding to an environment largely out of their personal control.","time":1490297627,"resto":117953545,"id":"lZ7+Iv1D","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117972026,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)15:34:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117971125\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117971125<\/a><br>If you live with your family you&#039;re just a manbaby millennial lazy shit.<br>America developed this idea that you need to move out as soon as possible and buy your own home with a fence and yard and garage for your 1-2 cars.","time":1490297693,"resto":117953545,"id":"8iTqlpUs","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117972112,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)15:35:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"Anyone that says they can&#039;t live on minimum wage is a dumb fuck who doesn&#039;t know how to live conservatively or is somehow already is up to their nipples in debt.","time":1490297745,"resto":117953545,"id":"KsRqMvO1","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117972206,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)15:36:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117953545\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117953545<\/a><br>The poor have to die you moron.

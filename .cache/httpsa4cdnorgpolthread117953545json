Like a real fucking answer? Then shut the fuck up and listen for a second. What are wages and how are they derived? A wage is a share of profits in a company made by a projection of an employee&#039;s productivity. A company cannot raise wages in excess of projected profits nor can it lower them to levels that drive away potential workers. There&#039;s an ideal equalibrium between the three factors in question being wages, profits, and cost of living, and at the center of them all is production. Production is the cheif goal of a corporate venture. It is not the boss that pays the worker but the customer. The boss simply handles the money in between. In the united states there are many significant barriers to production, mostly oversight boards and unions that prevent increases in output and thus value. Consider for instance teachers unions and their effect on the quality of public education. Normally a poor educator would be dismissed from an educational institution. Teachers unions prevent this more often than not. Over time it decreses the output of the school in terms of real value. Furthermore the union will fight for higher or at least constant wages despite the slow decline in production. This causes an upset in the equalibrium of the trinity.

It does this by squeezing benefits from those who make more than the minimum wage. Whether this results in a net social gain or not is a difficult question since there&#039;s so many variables and unremovable information problems.<br><br>All fixed wages result in continuous transfers. The fundamental theorems of welfare economics are very clear that one-time transfers of any sort result in equilibrium being established, though not the same equilibrium. I don&#039;t know how the mathematics could be adapted to manage continuous transfers but my guess is that whether it&#039;s within the mathematical reach of economists is unimportant, and I do expect that if someone were capable of it they would see that a new kind of equilibrium could be established, by analogy with the spacetime interval from relativity theory (a &quot;unit&quot; everyone in all inertial reference frames can agree on). <br><br>Nevertheless I do not support minimum wages since government regulation destroys information, especially opportunity cost information.

Like a real fucking answer? Then shut the fuck up and listen for a second. What are wages and how are they derived? A wage is a share of profits in a company made by a projection of an employee&#039;s productivity. A company cannot raise wages in excess of projected profits nor can it lower them to levels that drive away potential workers. There&#039;s an ideal equalibrium between the three factors in question being wages, profits, and cost of living, and at the center of them all is production. Production is the cheif goal of a corporate venture. It is not the boss that pays the worker but the customer. The boss simply handles the money in between. In the united states there are many significant barriers to production, mostly oversight boards and unions that prevent increases in output and thus value. Consider for instance teachers unions and their effect on the quality of public education. Normally a poor educator would be dismissed from an educational institution. Teachers unions prevent this more often than not. Over time it decreses the output of the school in terms of real value. Furthermore the union will fight for higher or at least constant wages despite the slow decline in production. This causes an upset in the equalibrium of the trinity.

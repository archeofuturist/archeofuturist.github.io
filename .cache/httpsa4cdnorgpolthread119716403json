Their bodies were left on the KwaMatiwane hillside to be eaten by vultures and scavengers,[5] as was Dingane&#039;s custom with his enemies. Dingane then directed the attack against the Voortrekker laagers,[4] which plunged the migrant movement into temporary disarray and in total 534 men, women and children were killed.<br><br>Following the decisive Voortrekker victory at Blood River, Andries Pretorius and his &quot;victory commando&quot; recovered the remains of the Retief party.

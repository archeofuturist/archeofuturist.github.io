The entire floor was in shambles, busted ceilings, exposed insulation, abandoned office supplies...absolutely no security. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Ask anyone who knew Manhattan at the time, nd they&#039;ll tell you, numerous floors of the WTC were unoccupied, several in disrepair.

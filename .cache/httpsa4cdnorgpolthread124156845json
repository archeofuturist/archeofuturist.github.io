Stop fucking talking about Clinton, stop fucking talking about Trump. No one understands how much external pressure and manipulation a president has to deal with every day. Like how Bush was manipulated by Cheney. Same went for Obama, and it will probably happen with Trump. As president, there are always people you think you can trust but end up manipulating you because they have access to the most powerful position on this planet if they befriend you. Both sides need to shut the fuck up and point their hate at our congressmen, not focus on the president. It&#039;s easy to ridicule one person, it&#039;s not easy to criticize 535 people who are exponentially more corrupt than the president. I fucking hate political discourse nowadays, and both sides are eating-up propaganda and disinformation. Overconsumption of media and increased &quot;black and white&quot; polarization of both sides is the direct cause of all this. Just come together and listen to each other&#039;s opinions and focus your anger on the people who are fucking BOTH sides over: the special interests and corrupt congressmen. Those people WANT us to fight over superficial shit and easy targets, so we don&#039;t focus on how badly they&#039;re fucking us over. WE ARE BEING FUCKED, and NO ONE IS NOTICING. Stop talking about being &quot;red-pilled&quot; (or &quot;woke,&quot; for the ebonic anons) if you aren&#039;t focusing more then 50% of your anger and political discourse on our congressmen. Fuck liberal shills, fuck blind-follower Trump supporters, and most of all, fuck all of you anons for not doing shit.","filename":"2308_520","ext":".jpg","w":520,"h":520,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493954339016,"time":1493954339,"md5":"IaWLseSwGQ80I97OrsIQdA==","fsize":11993,"resto":0,"id":"oJNATGdw","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-black-pill","country_name":"United States","replies":11,"images":3,"unique_ips":7},{"no":124159242,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)23:42:51","name":"Anonymous","filename":"Picture22","ext":".jpg","w":1559,"h":1556,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":124,"tim":1493955771252,"time":1493955771,"md5":"9tRvNSxEc\/kPMC1\/Nhud8w==","fsize":566919,"resto":124156845,"id":"ulwrP1k7","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":124159533,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)23:45:45","name":"Anonymous","filename":"Picture11","ext":".jpg","w":1539,"h":809,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":65,"tim":1493955945176,"time":1493955945,"md5":"HdIzQSUgAM9uri4BKx1PWg==","fsize":317901,"resto":124156845,"id":"ulwrP1k7","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":124160158,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)23:52:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124156845\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124156845<\/a><br>Truth right here op.","time":1493956343,"resto":124156845,"id":"FbHdtqMr","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124160295,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)23:53:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124156845\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124156845<\/a><br>I make big cums and put save in fields.","time":1493956420,"resto":124156845,"id":"cMYm2yaO","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":124160375,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)23:54:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124160295\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124160295<\/a><br>I fucked up, abandon thread before people make fun of me 3:","time":1493956465,"resto":124156845,"id":"cMYm2yaO","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":124161524,"now":"05\/05\/17(Fri)00:05:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124156845\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124156845<\/a><br>that&#039;s why we all hate (((them))) bro","time":1493957134,"resto":124156845,"id":"YK1YBOJS","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124161767,"now":"05\/05\/17(Fri)00:08:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124160158\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124160158<\/a><br>Fuck politics I&#039;m going off the grid.<br><br><a href=\"#p124161524\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124161524<\/a><br>You&#039;re missing the point.

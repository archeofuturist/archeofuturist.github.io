Lee. Lee objected to slavery on moral grounds, yet he still fought for the South because he felt deep commitment to his state, duty to his people, honor, opposition to federal overreach, etc. Basically, his reasons for fighting in the war were explicitly not racist, just a deeply felt duty to defend his home, his people, his culture. That is the epitome of Southern Pride, and the reason the battle flag of northern Virginia has become its standard. <br>Of course most people don&#039;t know that, they just see the flag and think racism! While they are misguided, it is understandable. No one knows the history of the flag for obvious (((reasons))). Also, Lee was so popular during the war that his regimental flag was incorporated into the actual flag of the CSA (the Stars and Bars) later in the war, further blurring the history. Look up the current flag of Mississippi, it&#039;s almost the exact same as the Stars and Bars. There&#039;s definitely an argument that the Stars and Bars is racist, but not the Lee regimental","time":1493160882,"resto":122798402,"id":"L5Adu9Si","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122802625,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)19:00:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"Honestly, if I lived in the U.S., I&#039;d fly it.

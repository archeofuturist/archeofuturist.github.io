First I saw about 6 large semi-trucks with gaurd trucks in front and behind. The first 4 or so trucks had 2 or 3 large armored vehicles per truck (wide load), 1 had what looked like the back end of a large piece of artillery, and the other had two more armored vehicles except these were black for whatever reason.<br><br>About 30 minutes later I saw another string of military semis carrying more armored vehicles. Most of these semis were hauling 2 large unmarked crates each, I&#039;m assuming supplies and other equipment.<br><br>In my entire life of living in NE (21 years), I have never once seen anything like this. Very very rarely (like once every 5 years) I&#039;ll see some standard Army or Air Force trucks pass through (saw some about a month ago, two Army semis heading west as well), but the sheer amount of equipment that was being transferred was astounding.<br><br>There&#039;s probably two places they&#039;re heading: either Denver for it&#039;s base, or more likely California or the west coast somewhere. Any thoughts? Is something big going to happen soon? Are we finally re-militarizing under Trump? Anyone seen anything like this lately?","filename":"1486102907148","ext":".png","w":1589,"h":1600,"tn_w":248,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492456907871,"time":1492456907,"md5":"uRw4xzHuxeC2Tjm61tWZBA==","fsize":1530184,"resto":0,"id":"P4aYvc0G","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"so-yesterday-i-was-driving-east-on-i80-between","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

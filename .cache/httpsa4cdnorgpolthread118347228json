Yesterday I met some cute half black girls at the kopstoot bar (interracial themed party) in Amsterdam. If you guys would leave your basement you wouldn&#039;t be so bitter. <br>It&#039;s kind of lame to care that much about race in 2017. In the end it won&#039;t really matter anyways. We&#039;ll look back in a different way at this in 50 years. By then I think Europe will be completely multi cultural to where no matter where you you&#039;ll see people of all ethnic groups mixed in. The trend is that Earth is becoming a planetary society where every &quot;nation&quot; will have similarities in clothes, music, art, and expression. In the short term this is very turbulent and often problematic, but in the long term it makes sense.","filename":"steph","ext":".jpg","w":1000,"h":1362,"tn_w":91,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490533911233,"time":1490533911,"md5":"jtJHQ7XTvqfWfHea2u2jag==","fsize":812888,"resto":118347228,"id":"NFYf8AmC","country":"NL","m_img":1,"country_name":"Netherlands"}]}

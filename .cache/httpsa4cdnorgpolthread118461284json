I feel like everything is brainwashing to fulfill a narrative. Every TV show and movie I watch I can&#039;t finish because there&#039;s some racemixing in it (dark man and white woman as usual). I can&#039;t take anything seriously and question everything I see. I feel like the only person who isn&#039;t programmed to spout establishment talking points<br><br>The society that I&#039;ve been raised and indoctrinated in is all a lie. I&#039;ve been lied to my whole life. The teacher&#039;s I listened to, the movies I watched, the music I listen to, they all seem to be working in concert to render me docile and ashamed of who I am. But what can we do? The more I learn, the more I realize how deep the brainwashing is and how utterly impossible it will be to reverse. I can see very few scenarios where whites and the West will persevere, mostly because no one seems to give a shit. <br><br>Why couldn&#039;t I live in blissful ignorance like the rest of the normies? And the worst part is that I can&#039;t forget about it or ignore it, it&#039;s all stuck with me forever. I can&#039;t unlearn the things I have learned. Is the truth worth it when ignorance is such comparative bliss?","filename":"1a","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":337,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1490583239443,"time":1490583239,"md5":"ShhqN2LQoLol2qQR9Ajg9w==","fsize":24606,"resto":0,"id":"MVFKhiZ+","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"i-wish-i-took-the-blue-pill","country_name":"United States","replies":146,"images":40,"unique_ips":77,"tail_size":50},{"no":118461435,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)22:55:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118461284\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118461284<\/a><br>First off stop watching TV.","time":1490583332,"resto":118461284,"id":"hchtB4wA","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118461460,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)22:55:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118461284\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118461284<\/a><br>The only solution t&#039;s BBC anon.<br><br>Just spread wide and remember to breathe.","time":1490583349,"resto":118461284,"id":"Yqpcuc+2","country":"CL","country_name":"Chile"},{"no":118461491,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)22:56:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118461435\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118461435<\/a><br>Second off stop watching movies.","time":1490583370,"resto":118461284,"id":"hchtB4wA","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118461555,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)22:56:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118461284\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118461284<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;watching TV<\/span><br><br>oy vey<br><br>there&#039;s plenty of good movies worth watching though","time":1490583403,"resto":118461284,"id":"p+mXqYtu","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118461560,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)22:56:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"You&#039;ll be okay.

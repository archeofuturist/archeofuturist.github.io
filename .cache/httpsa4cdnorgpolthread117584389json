Mulattoes are almost never accepted as white, so they instead identify entirely as black rather than mixed race. Mixed race Asians are a fairly recent phenomenon, but hapa children of Europeans and Asians have historically never been accepted in Asian countries: for example, Indo-Dutch children were persecuted after the end of Dutch occupation, and many Viet-American babies of US soldiers had to be brought to America because they would be ostracized in Vietnam.<br><br>Because neither whites nor asians are welcoming of the racially impure, hapas are left without any racial identity at all. This is why Hapa males are rightfully stereotyped as being &quot;beta&quot;: never fully accepted by either group, they never truly &quot;belong&quot; anywhere. It is commonly thought that female hapas escape this complex, but I suspect this is simply because most hapa women are so attractive that they never experience any kind of discrimination. <br><br>Hapa males are not genetically inferior; they are only conditioned to believe that they are inferior because of their inability to feel racial pride.","filename":"1478054779442","ext":".png","w":537,"h":525,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":244,"tim":1490069143529,"time":1490069143,"md5":"8k+FW6w1F7Zlc07nhHFlQg==","fsize":106478,"resto":0,"id":"6Y7fTx1I","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-reason-why-hapa-males-are-beta","country_name":"United States","replies":52,"images":6,"unique_ips":28},{"no":117584701,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)00:08:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117584389\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117584389<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;neither whites nor asians are welcoming of the racially impure, hapas are left without any racial identity at all.<\/span><br><br>yep","time":1490069318,"resto":117584389,"id":"pkxlemTl","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":117585029,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)00:11:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"That&#039;s why you import a Guatemalan girl for your hapa and then their kid mixes in","time":1490069509,"resto":117584389,"id":"nzcK5K3w","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117585136,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)00:13:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"Yeah that sounds about right.

I have met a few others like me as well but I don&#039;t think most mulattoes identify entirely as black. it&#039;s the media\/lefist\/(((their))) idea to equate the success of mulattoes with the (lack of) success of pure-bred blacks. <br><br>See: every successful &quot;black&quot; person in the history of america (mostly mulattos or quadroons)","time":1490071617,"resto":117584389,"id":"3nIsBhIU","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117588542,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)00:47:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117587921\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117587921<\/a><br><a href=\"#p117585628\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117585628<\/a><br>is California rightful Hapa containment area?","time":1490071629,"resto":117584389,"id":"R+3ZKBv6","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117588654,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)00:48:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117588527\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117588527<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I&#039;ll take &#039;what is a quadroon&#039; for 400<\/span>","filename":"download (1)","ext":".jpg","w":285,"h":177,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":77,"tim":1490071690418,"time":1490071690,"md5":"\/gAuc8ex+QYRy094u2JV\/w==","fsize":9862,"resto":117584389,"id":"R+3ZKBv6","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117588746,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)00:48:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117588315\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117588315<\/a><br>what is this? racmixing for ants?","filename":"34","ext":".gif","w":15,"h":12,"tn_w":15,"tn_h":12,"tim":1490071736443,"time":1490071736,"md5":"utix8HGMPHSnPsgBYVD+ZA==","fsize":6033,"resto":117584389,"id":"pkxlemTl","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":117588891,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)00:50:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117588654\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117588654<\/a><br>a quadroon is 1\/8th black person. very rarely will a quadroon identify as black unless they&#039;re some hollywood patsy.","time":1490071815,"resto":117584389,"id":"3nIsBhIU","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117588947,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)00:50:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117587738\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117587738<\/a><br>Racial identity issues are difficult to understand without firsthand experience.

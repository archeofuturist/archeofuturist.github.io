The process of desalination is very simple but very energy intensive for large quantities of water. It&#039;s only practical if you have the infrastructure to provide and deliver cheap electricity, like from nuclear power plants or something. <br>If we get nuclear fusion plants (potentially in the next 20 years, we have prototypes that work but aren&#039;t net producers of energy yet) then energy will become incredibly cheap and we could all feasibly drink desalinated ocean water for (almost) free. It would be amazing.","filename":"IMG_8305","ext":".jpg","w":351,"h":354,"tn_w":123,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492884677704,"time":1492884677,"md5":"WQCQWQypGxuJ+7m2tsTPhQ==","fsize":44377,"resto":122277312,"id":"qm+KdHsf","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122307280,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)14:14:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122305922\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122305922<\/a><br>The niggers would have to build their own sustainable, with some market protection, food economy, and ones it seeps into their minds they will have less kids, that also means less refugees to europe (also less wars).<br>And besides that tits like this should be able to wear a bikini like that, that is harrasment.","time":1492884875,"resto":122277312,"id":"86Fedo7z","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":122307298,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)14:14:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122277312\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122277312<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;it&#039;s this wide, anon ;)<\/span>","filename":"1438134541668","ext":".gif","w":500,"h":340,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":85,"tim":1492884886701,"time":1492884886,"md5":"lhLwSuL6NUF5rCE2N2xKVA==","fsize":786791,"resto":122277312,"id":"Bn448lUU","country":"RS","country_name":"Serbia"},{"no":122307408,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)14:15:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122291416\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122291416<\/a><br>Faggot detected","time":1492884951,"resto":122277312,"id":"77rBF3rF","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122307524,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)14:16:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122283652\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122283652<\/a><br>Mmmm nigger paste","time":1492885019,"resto":122277312,"id":"5Bm3rWHp","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122307739,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)14:18:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"Feeding the world is not the USA&#039;s problem.<br><br>The USA is only responsible for feeding the USA.","time":1492885136,"resto":122277312,"id":"4QaaRS+D","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122307822,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)14:19:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122277528\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122277528<\/a><br>seriously fucking south sudan going through a famine and the Muslim nigs have 20 children. f","time":1492885173,"resto":122277312,"id":"ESKIQzuj","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122307881,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)14:20:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122283198\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122283198<\/a><br><br> THIS","filename":"1492819614920","ext":".jpg","w":271,"h":400,"tn_w":84,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492885205333,"time":1492885205,"md5":"o\/nOJhMxQ0opJqo3C8hyqA==","fsize":21141,"resto":122277312,"id":"aMqc8FmV","country":"EC","country_name":"Ecuador"},{"no":122308024,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)14:21:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122307408\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122307408<\/a><br>There is some kind of psychology behind this for them not liking tits like this.<br>I assume it is a mixture of closeted homosexuals or homosexual tendencies or some juvenile rejection from female peers or some other sexual focus like ass which would be excuseable.","time":1492885295,"resto":122277312,"id":"86Fedo7z","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":122308047,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)14:21:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122291416\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122291416<\/a><br><br>oh yeah almost forgot, you americans enjoy this kind of big.","filename":"big-black-cocks-huge-dicks-24","ext":".jpg","w":261,"h":400,"tn_w":81,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492885305831,"time":1492885305,"md5":"+Tx2uZfRSgbaAWFrvXj9mw==","fsize":96934,"resto":122277312,"id":"Bn448lUU","country":"RS","country_name":"Serbia"},{"no":122308169,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)14:22:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122307739\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122307739<\/a><br>And yet it&#039;s also the largest food exporter in the world by a considerable margin.","filename":"EmilyBarry9","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":640,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492885372955,"time":1492885372,"md5":"GP4JWp+XP53zIkkUdbIf8A==","fsize":129821,"resto":122277312,"id":"bIK5rZIj","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122308324,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)14:24:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122282537\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122282537<\/a><br>On it&#039;s own volition they import food, you mother fuck.

Will we see laws like this popping up in other states?<br><br>http:\/\/archive.is\/qZEm0<br><br>On Monday, a panel of judges for the 5th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals heard arguments in Barber v. Bryant, a challenge to Mississippi\u2019s HB 1523\u2014easily the most sweeping anti-LGBTQ bill passed since the Supreme Court struck down same-sex marriage bans nationwide in 2015. Passed in response to that ruling less than a year later, the Mississippi law would permit religious individuals, businesses, and government officials to discriminate against LGBTQ people in a broad array of contexts. Shortly before it took effect, a federal judge blocked HB 1523 as an egregious constitutional violation. Mississippi appealed to the 5th Circuit, drawing a panel of three conservative judges. Before Monday\u2019s hearing, it seemed probable that these judges would reverse the district court and let HB 1523 take effect. But after 90 lively minutes of arguments, that outcome is no longer assured. In fact, the court often appeared skeptical of the law\u2019s constitutionality and wary of its malevolent intent.<br><br>To grasp what\u2019s at stake in this litigation, consider the unprecedented reach of the Mississippi bill. A typical religious freedom statute protects all beliefs and allows the government to restrict religious exercise when it has a compelling reason to do so. (Mississippi already has such a law.) By contrast, HB 1523 protects just three beliefs and does so absolutely, permitting no exemptions. The law seeks only to safeguard individuals who believe that marriage is \u201cthe union of one man and one woman\u201d; that \u201csexual relations are properly reserved to such a marriage\u201d; and that \u201can individual\u2019s immutable biological sex\u201d is \u201cobjectively determined by anatomy and genetics at time of birth.\u201d","filename":"rainbowwaffles","ext":".jpg","w":580,"h":400,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":172,"tim":1491347635911,"time":1491347635,"md5":"H69O\/TAFuYyAym9y6G8Plw==","fsize":173950,"resto":0,"id":"7sh9sL0A","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"mississippi-religious-freedom-bill-goes-before","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":119532141,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)19:16:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119531914\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119531914<\/a><br>Based nigger-state.

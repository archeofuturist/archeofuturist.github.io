He thought being President would be just as easy as being CEO ... which for him means someone else would do the hard work, and he&#039;d slap his name on the end result.<br><br>He really doesn&#039;t know what goes into the empires that he&#039;s run. He doesn&#039;t know how to build buildings. He doesn&#039;t know how to get permits. He doesn&#039;t know how to hire contractors.<br><br>He doesn&#039;t know how to write a script for TV, or what a real executive producer does. He doesn&#039;t know how to educate people, or how to write a book. He isn&#039;t a cattle rancher or a textiles manufacturer.<br><br>He&#039;s a name. A name and a suit and a hairpiece.

This is uncharted territory for Donald Trump ... he actually has responsibilities.<br><br>So he&#039;s scared and lonely and angry, and he reacts to that the way any manchild would. He mashes his red button, summoning a manservant with an icy cold soda pop, and then he sulks off to the living room to play video games.

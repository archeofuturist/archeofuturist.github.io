successful than England. England is constantly going into debt and recessions. While Scotland creates a profit. You&#039;re a thick fuck, it was Scotland who basically started the idea of the union when the King of Scotland became the king of England. Scotland had its own little nations spread across the world but needed more trade routes so relied off English trade. Scottish people fought against England making sure Scotland wouldn&#039;t be a slave state, William Wallace and Robert Burns made sure of that. Instead of Scotland being slaves like the Welsh and Irish we became equal partners, which is why we have a separate parliament that has the power to call a referendum whenever it gets enough petitions. England is scared to lose us. Why would David Cameron and countless of English politicians and public beg to keep Scotland in the union? If it wasn&#039;t for the scare mongering Scotland would be independent and far better off, following the Norwegian\/Danish example of economy. There&#039;s no way we&#039;ll be paying with our oil to keep England becoming bankrupt. Nothern England probably will come with us, petitions in Nothern England were happening in the last referendum to make the north part of Scotland. England is a pathetic country run by immigrants, jews, perverts for immigrants, jews and perverts. some English people don&#039;t deserve to live in England because they&#039;re decent but cunts like you should stay there and rot in your own culturally marxist pot.","filename":"IMG_1328","ext":".jpg","w":514,"h":388,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":94,"tim":1493458948858,"time":1493458948,"md5":"qJWA87PpUvwoE34\/MlZ9OQ==","fsize":28828,"resto":123317002,"id":"umrhq6Ph","country":"IL","country_name":"Israel"},{"no":123317481,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)05:42:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123317275\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123317275<\/a><br>Greeks &gt; Scots","time":1493458950,"resto":123317002,"id":"O\/1q+yUf","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123317496,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)05:42:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123317266\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123317266<\/a><br><br>Stay on as leader, the base loves him.","time":1493458957,"resto":123317002,"id":"vfYRbatA","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123317503,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)05:42:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123317432\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123317432<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;hillary<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;anti foreigner<\/span><br><br>heh","filename":"PRESIDENT TRUMP","ext":".jpg","w":851,"h":314,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":46,"tim":1493458961958,"time":1493458961,"md5":"njOleRsyVC4+kwFqqoCxJg==","fsize":279783,"resto":123317002,"id":"qWYtjj3f","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123317512,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)05:42:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;go to gig last night<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Get wasted<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Have an awesome time<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Get a blowie at the end of the night.<\/span><br><br>Altogether not bad","filename":"Snapchat-1648399121","ext":".jpg","w":1152,"h":2048,"tn_w":70,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493458972974,"time":1493458972,"md5":"+M7viNqk+VSeBjWVtSWRMg==","fsize":384008,"resto":123317002,"id":"7svsIfol","country":"GB","m_img":1,"country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123317525,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)05:42:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123317432\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123317432<\/a>","filename":"feels","ext":".png","w":704,"h":994,"tn_w":88,"tn_h":124,"tim":1493458979602,"time":1493458979,"md5":"Ul1S7zWjArmycgIZRUsi1g==","fsize":310023,"resto":123317002,"id":"pdpmVat1","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":123317535,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)05:43:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;tfw there are people in this thread that prefer living in a city<\/span>","filename":"Really John","ext":".jpg","w":1920,"h":1080,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1493458991747,"time":1493458991,"md5":"fYdjPAKrP99u9417VS\/PlA==","fsize":160044,"resto":123317002,"id":"PnIOu5MW","country":"GB","m_img":1,"country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123317545,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)05:43:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123317447\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123317447<\/a><br>What a muslim drug?

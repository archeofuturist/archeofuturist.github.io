If you think about this, it&#039;s an indication the majority of male contribution to reproduction, child-rearing, and the family unit is through their social roles.<br><br>But society has been undermining and reducing the value of male social roles for decades. As providers, men are often replaced by the state and by women in the workplace. (This has the unfortunate side effect of making men less attractive as long-term partners to women who earn more than they do.) As hunters and protectors, they&#039;ve been so completely replaced by societal machinery that they&#039;re not needed or allowed to protect by law and they&#039;ve been made unnecessary (by other men, ironically) as hunters. As parents, their importance is denied (to the detriment of their children&#039;s development). As leaders, they&#039;re often assailed for their masculinity as the source of social ills that wouldn&#039;t exist with female leaders. They&#039;re also criticized for their masculinity in a world that increasingly values feminized leaders and leadership skills.<br><br>TL;DR: Men&#039;s value in society and in the family is through social roles that have been diminished or destroyed.

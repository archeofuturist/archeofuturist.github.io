TheShadowBrokers voted for you. TheShadowBrokers supports you. TheShadowBrokers is losing faith in you. Mr. Trump helping theshadowbrokers, helping you. Is appearing you are abandoning \u201cyour base\u201d, \u201cthe movement\u201d, and the peoples who getting you elected.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;President Trump, theshadowbrokers is offering our services to you and your administration. Did you know most of theshadowbrokers\u2019 members have taken the oath \u201c\u2026to protect and defend the constitution of the United States against all enemies foreign and domestic\u2026\u201d. Yes sir! Most of us used to be TheDeepState everyone is talking about. But we realized TheDeepState is being the enemy of the constitution, individualism, life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. With the right funding we can recruit some of the best hacker intel peoples in United States and world. \u201cUnmasking\u201d is being new buzz word, so we use. TheShadowBrokers is being happy to unmask anyone we considering to be an enemy of the Constitution of the United States. Enemies like John McCain. Something doesn\u2019t rub theshadowbrokers rite about Vietnam War POW who at every opportunity seeks to do violence to others via the proxy of young service men and women. If anyone should be being pacifist, slow to pick fight it should be being former POW. TheShadowBrokers is sure if we \u201cunmasking\u201d, Senator McCain, Magog itself might come out, many defense contractors, Saudi Princes, and possibly little Vietnamese boy he shares with Senator Lindsey Graham, not cool!<\/span>","filename":"heartattack","ext":".jpg","w":840,"h":798,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":237,"tim":1491748202770,"time":1491748202,"md5":"QMwUWP9tuvCp2LNcf9JnvA==","fsize":294275,"resto":0,"id":"PzNpnh\/u","country":"AU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"massive-shadow-brokers-nsa-leak","country_name":"Australia","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

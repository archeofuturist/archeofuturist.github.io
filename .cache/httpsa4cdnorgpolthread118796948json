Now, many people say, \u201cI\u2019m not interested in that\u201d and so on, but our people are being disprivileged about this. They don\u2019t know about it at all.

It will mean that people will be so broken down and useless and hopeless that all they\u2019ll do is watch soccer on Sky, shop in Sainsbury\u2019s, and refuse to vote for New Labour as we get to a situation where New Labour replaces the Tories as the party of government.

A large proportion of our population don\u2019t want any trouble. They don\u2019t want any trouble. They\u2019ve privatized their own lives. Privatize your own health and your family\u2019s; privatize your own schooling. Large stretches of the middle class do this, and a significant proportion of working class people who are up and into that club want it as well. If society has gone for pot, I\u2019m for mine! That\u2019s the view. You\u2019ll hear it everywhere. I hear it from people in their early years and mid-life now. And amongst many older people I hear this refrain: \u201cI\u2019ll be dead before it happens.\u201d I hear that quite a lot. \u201cOh, it\u2019ll happen in 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 100 years, but I\u2019ll be gone.

Culture and children.

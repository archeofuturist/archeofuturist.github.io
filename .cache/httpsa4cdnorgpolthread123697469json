Neither Trump nor the Republicans got much of anything they wanted.<br><br>Trump asked for a $1.2 billion cut to the NIH. Instead, Congress increased funding by $2 billion. Not only did he not get any money to build the Wall; Congress put explicit restrictions on the money it did allocate for border security, stipulating that it could not be spent on building the Wall. Planned Parenthood got no cuts (that&#039;s a loss to the congressional Republicans, too). Domestic spending actually goes up overall, including money for the NEA and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. There will be no staff cuts to the EPA (Trump had a sought a cut of about a 1\/3 of its entire budget). The one thing Trump got was more money for the military (though not nearly as much as he wanted), and the only reason he got it was that part of the Democratic Party wanted it, too. <br><br>Face it, Trumpcucks. The dream is over. Not only is your man a neocon warhawk, but he&#039;s a lame duck as well\u2014despite the fact that his party controls both the house and the senate.

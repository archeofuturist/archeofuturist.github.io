Original sin teaches readers that humans are capable of great evil. We intuitively know that humans are also capable of great good. This reinforces the concept that individual choice is what matters in how your life (or afterlife) ends up. Human nature isn&#039;t necessarily bad. <br><br>2. I don&#039;t quite get what you&#039;re asking here. <br><br>3. If the theoretical God is omnipotent, he would know the intentions of your choices. This means that he would know your intentions when you commit whatever sin, and wouldn&#039;t necessarily forgive you if you sinned and didn&#039;t truly feel any guilt for it. Christianity teaches that obligation to God is above obligation to other people but obviously one can have obligations to both and still be Christian.","time":1491211449,"resto":119310007,"id":"zwUlRqTv","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119312522,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)05:57:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119310007\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119310007<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;1.

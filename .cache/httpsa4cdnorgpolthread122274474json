I feel for the hard-pinched, the ill-treated, the beaten down labouring classes of England, Scotland and Ireland, to whom you do all the mischief that it is in your power to do; because you describe their situation as good, and because you do, in some degree, at any rate, draw the public attention away from their sufferings.&quot;<br><br>When Richard Oastler&#039;s Ten Hours Movement argued for a reduction in the working day for children, the government opposed the move, saying that it would be detrimental to trade.

If these little girls work two hours less in a day than they do now, it would occasion the ruin of the country.&quot;<br><br>For the little girls of Lancashire, for the bent and crippled children of England&#039;s mills and mines, there was never a Wilberforce, and no anti-slavery pamphlets were ever circulated.","filename":"childlabor-05","ext":".png","w":1031,"h":670,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":162,"tim":1492865982421,"time":1492865982,"md5":"3u3lMnTi64XrximCd7XC+A==","fsize":889971,"resto":0,"id":"1YvhVskp","country":"GB","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"well-in-1823-he-sent-a-letter-to-william","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

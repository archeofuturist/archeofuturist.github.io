Daily reminder that sea levels around the world were about 400 feet lower just before the end of the last Ice Age.<br><br>Near the end of the last Ice Age about 12,800 years ago, a giant comet that had entered the Solar System from deep space thousands of years earlier, broke into multiple fragments. Some of these fragments struck Earth, causing a global cataclysm unseen since the extinction of the dinosaurs. At least eight of the fragments hit the North American ice cap, while further fragments hit the Northern European ice cap. The impacts, from comet fragments a mile wide approaching at more than 60,000 miles an hour, generated huge amounts of heat which instantly liquidised millions of square kilometres of ice, destabilising Earth&#039;s crust and causing the global flood that is remembered in myths all around the world.<br><br>A second series of impacts, equally devastasting, causing further cataclysmic flooding, occurred about 11,600 years ago, the exact date that Plato gives for the destruction and submergence of Atlantis. The evidence for all of this shows beyond reasonable doubt that a civilisation at least as technologically advanced as 19th-century England at the onset of the Industrial Revolution (if not more technologically advanced) that flourished during the last Ice Age was destroyed in the global cataclysms between about 12,800 years ago and about 11,600 years ago.<br><br>A distant memory and a warning to the future - for the comet that wrought such destruction in remote antiquity may not be done with us yet.","filename":"iceagemap","ext":".png","w":853,"h":440,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":128,"tim":1493127842998,"time":1493127842,"md5":"cs0+u5uti9vK6vqtSQSaoQ==","fsize":557051,"resto":0,"id":"MT5xsBCS","country":"AU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-red-parts-of-this-map-used-to-be-land-daily","country_name":"Australia","replies":239,"images":45,"unique_ips":84,"tail_size":50},{"no":122735233,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)09:47:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"We \/x\/ nao!","time":1493128022,"resto":122734952,"id":"QbwCtt8I","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122735296,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)09:47:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122735233\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122735233<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\/x\/<\/span><br>This is all common knowledge you daft cunt.","time":1493128058,"resto":122734952,"id":"o\/Jp5aLA","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122735445,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)09:49:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122735233\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122735233<\/a><br><br>Everyone knows about the Younger Dryas period, you daft cunt.","time":1493128164,"resto":122734952,"id":"MT5xsBCS","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":122735510,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)09:50:09","name":"Anonymous","filename":"1416462805494","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":412,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":103,"tim":1493128209674,"time":1493128209,"md5":"nZNctsvJgPqS8BaIG+8lUA==","fsize":53951,"resto":122734952,"id":"t4+KKmGi","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":122735525,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)09:50:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122734952\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122734952<\/a><br>Nope sorry it was me having a bad day.","filename":"poseidon","ext":".jpg","w":596,"h":600,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493128214584,"time":1493128214,"md5":"viClKYFoLUI1cp92ijNegA==","fsize":48211,"resto":122734952,"id":"cvtr8jzN","country":"CH","country_name":"Switzerland"},{"no":122735994,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)09:55:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122735296\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122735296<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;we wuz atlanteans!<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;politics and current events<\/span>","time":1493128525,"resto":122734952,"id":"eurOLwr3","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122736001,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)09:55:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122734952\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122734952<\/a><br>whats the proof that if Atlantas did exist it was as advanced as the 19th century?","time":1493128529,"resto":122734952,"id":"6YNvYbvW","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122736119,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)09:56:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122735994\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122735994<\/a><br>you realize you sound like the fucking loony one denying something like atlantis, right?","time":1493128602,"resto":122734952,"id":"HgBweGy2","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122736147,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)09:57:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122735994\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122735994<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;eurO<\/span>","filename":"1491593291509","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":400,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1493128623407,"time":1493128623,"md5":"k2SNa4GNMcjg2N\/GBZjqjg==","fsize":30481,"resto":122734952,"id":"o\/Jp5aLA","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122736446,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)10:00:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122734952\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122734952<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The evidence for all of this shows beyond reasonable doubt that a civilisation at least as technologically advanced as 19th-century England at the onset of the Industrial Revolution (if not more technologically advanced) that flourished during the last Ice Age was destroyed in the global cataclysms between about 12,800 years ago and about 11,600 years ago.<\/span><br><br>You want to know how I know you&#039;re retarded?","time":1493128809,"resto":122734952,"id":"XJf5sQfT","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122736600,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)10:01:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122734952\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122734952<\/a><br>would about Earth crust displacement or pole shifts?

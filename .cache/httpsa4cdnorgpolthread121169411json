For more than a decade, as part of its strategy to prop up one of its only allies, China refused to allow the U.N. Security Council to even consider cutting oil shipments to North Korea. Beijing\u2019s calculus was that the maintenance of the North Korean regime took precedence over everything. Now Beijing seems to be reconsidering its position.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Perhaps even more significantly, on April 5, the Global Times, which is owned by the People\u2019s Daily, the official mouthpiece of the Chinese Communist Party, laid out what it called China\u2019s \u201cbottom line\u201d on the increasingly tense situation on the Korean Peninsula. First, the editorial said \u201cthe safety and stability\u201d of China\u2019s northeast must be assured. To that end, the editorial continued, no North Korean nuclear fallout can be allowed to \u201ccontaminate\u201d the region. Second, North Korea cannot be allowed to \u201cdescend into the kind of turbulence that generates a huge outpouring of refugees,\u201d the editorial said, adding that China will also not allow \u201ca hostile government\u201d in Pyongyang. It concluded by vowing that Beijing would not tolerate a U.S. military push towards the Yalu River.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;China has never before listed in such clear, albeit semi-official, terms what it wants for the Korean Peninsula. It\u2019s never before hinted that it would oppose the formation of a government hostile to Beijing\u2019s interests next door. So how is this related to Trump?<\/span>","time":1492231632,"resto":121169411,"id":"jmcqaLJC","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":121171484,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)00:48:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121171322\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121171322<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Once in office, Trump issued a series of tweets demanding that China do more to rein in North Korea. Trump administration sources have also leaked information vowing to punish a panoply of Chinese companies that have facilitated North Korea\u2019s busting of U.N. sanctions. (The Obama administration only sanctioned one of these firms.) Meanwhile, the U.S. military sped up its plans to deploy the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense antimissile system in South Korea, despite China\u2019s intense opposition.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;But that wasn\u2019t all. When Secretary of State Rex Tillerson traveled to Asia in March he warned that the United States would consider a preemptive strike on the north if its nuclear program continued unabated. \u201cThe policy of strategic patience,\u201d Tillerson announced, \u201chas ended.\u201d Finally, the North Korean bomb was front and center at the summit between Trump and China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, on April 6 and 7 at Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort. While eating \u201cthe most beautiful piece of chocolate cake,\u201d with Xi on the evening of April 6, Trump told the Chinese president that he had ordered U.S. forces to fire missiles at a Syrian air base, following the chemical weapons attack on Syrian civilians apparently by forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The strategy of backing North Korea no matter what is bumping up against the risk of an unpredictable man in the White House.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Following the summit, on Tuesday, Xi called Trump and declared that China wanted to see the crisis on the Korean Peninsula solved peacefully. Chinese news reports portrayed Xi as attempting to manage two unpredictable actors \u2013 Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un. A day later, the Global Times noted that the attack on Syria made it impossible to dismiss the possibility of a U.S. strike on North Korea. \u201cTrump\u2019s team apparently is determined to solve the North Korean nuclear problem,\u201d the Global Times observed.<\/span>","time":1492231734,"resto":121169411,"id":"jmcqaLJC","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":121171525,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)00:49:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;To be sure, other factors are combining to prompt a re-think in Beijing. Indeed, both Global Times editorials spoke about the pressures that \u201cChinese society\u201d is exerting on Beijing\u2019s policy. It\u2019s no exaggeration to say that the Chinese are fed up with Kim. On the Web, they refer to him as \u201cKim Fatman the Third.\u201d When they travel to North Korea on weekend trips, they smirk about how it reminds them of the days when China was poor and backward. A recent post on the WeChat social-media site compared North Korea to a \u201crabid dog,\u201d implying that someone (perhaps even China) should put it down.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Still, the recent pronouncements from Beijing show that Trump\u2019s unpredictability can be an asset in dealing with the Chinese and that his bellicosity can serve a purpose, too. History here can be a guide. In October 2002, then-Chinese President Jiang Zemin went to Crawford, Tex., to meet with then-President George W. Bush. North Korea had recently acknowledged that it was building a nuclear bomb. Bush asked Jiang to use his influence to shut the program down, but Jiang demurred, announcing, Bush wrote in his memoirs, that North Korea \u201cwas [Bush\u2019s] problem, not his.\u201d In January 2003, Bush tried again. Again Jiang didn\u2019t bite. Then in February, Bush warned that he was contemplating bombing North Korea. That got China\u2019s attention. In August 2003, under pressure from Beijing, North Korea agreed to join China, the United States, South Korea, Japan and Russia in the six-party talks.<\/span>","time":1492231762,"resto":121169411,"id":"jmcqaLJC","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":121171648,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)00:50:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"Trump is literally playing 5D chess as we speak","time":1492231847,"resto":121169411,"id":"jmcqaLJC","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":121172095,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)00:55:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"Bump.

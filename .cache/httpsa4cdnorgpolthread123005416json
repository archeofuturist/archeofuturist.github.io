As far as is know to me, now most of these humble people live in South Africa.<br><br>The north campaign crossed Caucasus mountains and settled in the north of black see in today Ukraine. But just 200 years later they too were hit by a migration period, as Slavs came pushing on them the same way they were pushed by Huns. Most of the north campaign were assimilated with Slavic people. Although keeping our faith in Kek, few traditions and stories of our people given from generation to generation by mouth.<br><br>The west campaign undergo similar faith, being pushed out of Balkan into Germanic tribes and being strongly Germanized. They however never forgot their ancestral call and when the way to the west was open, they went. To America. New world, by many western Kekistani seen as a gift from Kek for their faith.<br><br>The east campaign disappeared. We dont know what happen to them. I can only pray to Kek that they survived. But i have faith, as its foretold that Kekistani will come back to Kekistan and reunite.<br><br>Shadilay brothers.","filename":"kekvult","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":720,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1493274739644,"time":1493274739,"md5":"EYLjL5HXKhwQUl99fdCl6Q==","fsize":78279,"resto":0,"id":"0Kaocpaj","country":"CZ","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"struggle-of-kekistani-people","country_name":"Czech Republic","replies":2,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":123005444,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)02:32:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123005416\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123005416<\/a><br><br>This dispersion happened 2000 years ago. So our original language was mostly forgotten, with exception of few important words like Kek, Kekistan, shadilay and so on.<br>We dont know ho original Kekistani flag looked. But soon after creation of internet, Kekistani created groups and websites there. It was the first time after 2000 years, that our people found out what happened to other campaigns (except the East one).<br>This reunification gave birth to our flag, as a symbol of unity. The K stands for every group of Kekistani. North, south, east and west. And the center symbolizes Kekistanopol in ruin. The color green is a national color of our people.<br><br>To all other Kekistani out there, please, tell me stories of your struggle. The legends told by your parents. And Kekistani words and phrases you remember.

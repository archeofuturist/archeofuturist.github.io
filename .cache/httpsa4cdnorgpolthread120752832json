I&#039;m not a straight edge faggot and I have done my share of intoxicants, but let me tell you exactly why they&#039;re the ultimate bluepill.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Alcohol<\/span><br>The most socially acceptable, but the most degenerate when abused since they are so accepted by mainstream society. Getting drunk serves no purpose other than social lubrication. It may be nice to sip a glass of whiskey with a friend and discuss politics in a cordial setting but getting loaded on a whole case of beer is completely subhuman tier.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Weed<\/span><br>Out of all the drugs this has the worst culture surrounding it. It is not harmless. It is a depressant like anything else and slows down your productivity and problem solving.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Meth\/Adderall\/Amphetamines\/Cocaine<wbr><\/span><br>I call these the Chinese drugs. Good for working your ass off and getting menial tasks done but that&#039;s about it. That&#039;s for the Chinks. White men don&#039;t need it to be productive.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Heroin and other opiates<\/span><br>Completely degenerate, no questions asked. If you use these recreationally you are a plague on society.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Psychedelics<\/span><br>The secret bluepill. Yeah I know you think you&#039;re suddenly redpilled now because you took 3 tabs of acid and discovered new methods of consciousness. Trust me, I&#039;ve been there. But all it does is confuse your brain. Can you operate machinery on shrooms? Can you even talk to your parents? No, you&#039;re in an unstable frame of mind and you&#039;re seeing shit. It&#039;s a distraction and doesn&#039;t redpill you on anything except maybe how easy your brain is to reconfigure into a babbling child. I know some of you will be offended by this since you thought you discovered the redpill to end all redpills on your last DMT trip, but all it did was confuse you and never provided any meaningful, hardcore TRUTH to your experience, just altered state of consciousness.","filename":"1488939373382","ext":".png","w":500,"h":628,"tn_w":199,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492002260535,"time":1492002260,"md5":"hOS6IZA2FwlixUtztaX7Cg==","fsize":102161,"resto":0,"id":"HlKEIceE","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"drugs-are-not-redpilled","country_name":"United States","replies":35,"images":9,"unique_ips":27},{"no":120753811,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)09:15:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120752832\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120752832<\/a><br>i got some aspirin from a friend once and it was a red pill i felt pretty good afterwords","time":1492002906,"resto":120752832,"id":"HL0tzy7u","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120754031,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)09:17:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120753811\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120753811<\/a><br>nigger that was 44 pounds of cocaine","time":1492003061,"resto":120752832,"id":"H4N3dLmb","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120754208,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)09:19:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120752832\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120752832<\/a><br>i have a question<br>if i ever have to amputate my own leg should i get really high on heroin first?<br>i heard that it is pretty good for when you need to concentrate","time":1492003175,"resto":120752832,"id":"HL0tzy7u","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120754503,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)09:22:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120752832\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120752832<\/a><br><br>Pic related.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; &#039;intoxicants&#039;<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; &#039;social lubrication&#039;<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; &#039;sip a glass&#039;<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; &#039;whiskey&#039;<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; &#039;discuss politics&#039;<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; &#039;cordial setting&#039;<\/span><br><br>Just from OP&#039;s language, you can tell he&#039;s never been out on a Friday night, sunk a few, and gome home with an 8 or 9.","filename":"O P ","ext":".jpg","w":675,"h":1200,"tn_w":70,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492003363019,"time":1492003363,"md5":"RAm\/Kb\/kIEp3JKP0emT+zg==","fsize":103733,"resto":120752832,"id":"PvtJQFxR","country":"AU","m_img":1,"country_name":"Australia"},{"no":120754727,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)09:24:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120752832\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120752832<\/a><br>you&#039;re a faggot retard, nice picture you really understand what you&#039;re talking about","time":1492003496,"resto":120752832,"id":"6ayXAPNf","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120754869,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)09:26:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120754208\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120754208<\/a><br>Well I was given fentanyl when I had a car crash a few years ago.

And these new revolutionary mutinies occur when it\u2019s time for us to shoot another set of snuffs\u2014it just happens that way. About once a year. Sometimes a bit less frequently. Many people can\u2019t figure out why the Ork mutinies begin at just the right time. I don\u2019t follow it myself, but the mechanism is clear to me. In the Ork villages, they are still aghast at the sight of microwave ovens. They don\u2019t understand how there can be no fire, and nobody touches the hamburger, yet it gets hotter and hotter. It is very easy to do; you have to create an electromagnetic field to set the particles of the hamburger into rapid motion. The Ork revolutions are cooked in the same manner as hamburgers, save that the particles of shit in the Orks\u2019 heads are set into motion not by an electromagnetic field, but by the information field. You don\u2019t even have to send emissaries to them. It\u2019s enough for them to have any global metaphor\u2014and all our metaphors are global\u2014drop a hint to an arrogant Ork village that if love of freedom takes hold there, people will come to their rescue. Then love of freedom will undoubtedly pop up in this village, like a kind of easy money: the central authorities will pay the village headman, more and more, day after day; they will pay so that it doesn\u2019t manifest to the full extent for as long as possible, but this irrepressible ascent to freedom and happiness is not to be stopped. And we will not spare a manitou on it, though we could print for them as much as they wish. We just keep watching the process in excitement. And when it develops to the necessary degree, we\u2019ll start bombing.<\/span><br>from SNUFF by Viktor Pelevin.","time":1492688616,"resto":121973023,"id":"7Ups17lV","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":121986097,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)07:43:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121985590\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121985590<\/a><br>corrupt cops are a thing here too, although you can time it nicely so that you get a decent cop who goes by the books (fucking rare in Serbia tbqh)","time":1492688631,"resto":121973023,"id":"+RLoaqXs","country":"RS","country_name":"Serbia"},{"no":121986150,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)07:44:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121985702\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121985702<\/a><br>What for exactly?<br><br><a href=\"#p121985814\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121985814<\/a><br>Kek that&#039;ll show what a true professional you are.

He very well may be. But the official story is that he is a texas local and that seems to be the truth. Its not like his entire background is made up, it is that he started doing this after Oaklahoma City Federal Building bombing and that was his first big false flag thing and he was one of the only people brave enough to say it. he&#039;s been doing this for over 20 years and just the past 4 years or so has really started to blow up. he is totally a shekelstein type when it comes to his vitamins and shit. i don&#039;t really respect that, even tho the shit may work, its very expensive it seems and lots of these vitamin brand owners make millions a year or even 10s of millions per year. so I&#039;m not fully pro-AJ, and I used to watch colbert for years. at this point i think colbert is pretty creepy where AJ is like, kinda ridiculous, but somehow morally superior to colbert the past year or two.","time":1492854698,"resto":122259506,"id":"8LETLXBY","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122260146,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)05:53:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122260004\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122260004<\/a><br>We&#039;re talking about Colbert.

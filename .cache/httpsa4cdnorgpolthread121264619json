My country tells the English king George III to get fucked. Your king Louis the Sixteenth helps us humiliate George III only to himself be guillotined in a similar revolution that produces Emperor Bonaparte. Your country proceeds to roflstomp the rest of Europe, until an absolutely unholy alliance of Britain and Germany(prussia) stops you at Waterloo.<br><br>I&#039;m not really sure what happens from here until the Great War, but you fought valiantly there. Something obviously went way the fuck wrong between there and the second one, though, because the way we learn it over here, Hitler pretty much invented modern warfare when he ruined you in 1940.<br><br>So then war happens for a while, Charles de Gaulle becomes your national hero and here&#039;s where I get lost. What have you even been doing since 1945? You&#039;ve had five different systems of government, and now you do some thing where you have your primary election three weeks before the real one? This is where I need help.","filename":"french-pepe","ext":".jpg","w":528,"h":424,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":200,"tim":1492291910926,"time":1492291910,"md5":"nPiYSMHaQwaKDKNikAbBnA==","fsize":43273,"resto":0,"id":"5ORXZHCr","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"frogs-redpill-me-on-your-system-of-government","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":1,"unique_ips":2},{"no":121264805,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)17:33:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121264619\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121264619<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;fought valiantly<\/span><br>they fucking surrendered. the british are the real fighters","filename":"1475513081331","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":569,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":69,"tim":1492291999733,"time":1492291999,"md5":"oGqT9SgqQRvEWGhZxHt7iw==","fsize":99213,"resto":121264619,"id":"vSfcGo+3","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121265225,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)17:36:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121264619\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121264619<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Hitler pretty much invented modern warfare<\/span><br>hitler didnt innovate dick with it comes to warfare. if anything he lost the war by trying to play general.<br><br>guderian, von bock, rommel, these are some of the men responsible for the sucesses of the werhmacht. militarily hitler was a complete liability. a charismatic figurehead nothing more.","time":1492292182,"resto":121264619,"id":"vSfcGo+3","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

It really gives you a new perspective on life, when you visit those little mountain villages where the people live in bamboo huts with dirt floors and no electricity. The little kids run up to you and stare curiously, because they&#039;ve literally never seen a white person before. And the people of the villages are the most genuinely friendly and caring I&#039;ve ever met. They live on tiny farms, and most have never been more than 30 miles from where they were born. Yet they have something that we don&#039;t have here at home: A true purpose in life. They all have an important role in keeping the village alive, and they find genuine happiness in their day to day lives. There is no crime, the kids run freely and no one has locks on their doors. The men farm, hunt, and cook, the women herd cattle, harvest produce, and collect firewood, and the little kids help out with everything. <br><br>After that trip, I truly realized how fucked western culture has become. We live completely purposeless lives, and our society is full of dishonest people (even family) who will steal from you and hurt you at the drop of a hat.

Look at Islamic Countries religious minorities such as Christians, Hindus, Sikhs, Yazidi&#039;s, Buddhists, Secular People and etc. You hear stories of religious minorities being executed and targeted by religious extremists. Look at Pakistan, I am a Sikh and I am disgusted at how our people, and other religious minorites are treated. There are stories of our people being beheaded by Muslim&#039;s for being a part of different faiths or our women being kidnapped by Muslim&#039;s Pedophiles for forced marriage.

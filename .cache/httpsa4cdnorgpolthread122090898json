In these cities, nobody is laying down roots. Nobody is actually FROM the city. Everyone is from somewhere else. A rootless cosmopolitan.

It&#039;s part of the reason white birth rates are plummeting so low. We&#039;re being fucked economically. Living in the city is completely unviable unless you&#039;re some young hipster just going paycheck to paycheck, and impossible to raise a family there. The suburbs are getting more and more expensive, and they&#039;re also starting to fill up with &quot;vibrant diversity&quot; spilling over from the cities. In order to continue having wholesome white communities, you&#039;ll need to head further and further away from the diversity. And those areas that are still very white? You&#039;re paying a premium for that whiteness. And if you want good schools, you&#039;re going to have to pay extra for private school, because all the public schools are shit-tier and infested with niggers and crime. Not to mention paying more because you&#039;re driving your car further and further, along with having less free time due to your long commutes. And also the traffic gets worse since more and more people are traveling longer and longer. <br><br>These are all problems our ancestors did not have to deal with.

Bell thought it might be possible to generate undulating electrical currents that corresponded to sound waves.<br><br>In 1874, telegraph message traffic was rapidly expanding and in the words of Western Union President William Orton, had become &quot;the nervous system of commerce&quot;. Orton had contracted with inventors Thomas Edison and Elisha Gray to find a way to send multiple telegraph messages on each telegraph line to avoid the great cost of constructing new lines.[74] When Bell mentioned to Gardiner Hubbard and Thomas Sanders that he was working on a method of sending multiple tones on a telegraph wire using a multi-reed device, the two wealthy patrons began to financially support Bell&#039;s experiments Patent matters would be handled by Hubbard&#039;s patent attorney, Anthony Pollok.<br><br>Bell and Pollok visited the famous scientist Joseph Henry, who was then director of the Smithsonian Institution, and asked Henry&#039;s advice on the electrical multi-reed apparatus that Bell hoped would transmit the human voice by telegraph. Henry replied that Bell had &quot;the germ of a great invention&quot;. When Bell said that he did not have the necessary knowledge, Henry replied, &quot;Get it!&quot; That declaration greatly encouraged Bell to keep trying, even though he did not have the equipment needed to continue his experiments, nor the ability to create a working model of his ideas. However, a chance meeting in 1874 between Bell and Thomas A. Watson, an experienced electrical designer and mechanic at the electrical machine shop of Charles Williams.<br><br>Also, Bell was born in Scotland first patent was US.","time":1490658855,"resto":118579008,"id":"506EAJtf","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118581748,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)19:54:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118581166\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118581166<\/a><br>I don&#039;t know if there&#039;s a retarded flag scale, but if there is I&#039;m pretty sure a fucking star map is below a leaf.","time":1490658895,"resto":118579008,"id":"gHBg6VNr","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118582067,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)19:57:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118581748\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118581748<\/a><br>Your flag looks like a used maxipad.","time":1490659069,"resto":118579008,"id":"YTFV\/1Us","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118582194,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)19:58:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118579008\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118579008<\/a><br>look at canada, usa<br>they got nice, wide areas of red and white<br>I appreciate those thicc, red and white lines<br>and you\u00b4re just trying to show off with those shittons of tiny lines heck I can\u00b4t even count them<br>and whats with that blue over there, doesn\u00b4t fit at all<br><br>you get 6\/10 lederhosen, you gotta try harder<br>I\u00b4ll be drinking some maple sirup with canada here<br>canananada good","time":1490659138,"resto":118579008,"id":"\/4lmgWbH","country":"AT","country_name":"Austria"},{"no":118582309,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)19:59:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118581125\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118581125<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;that subtle swastika though<\/span><br><br>hnnnggggg","time":1490659194,"resto":118579008,"id":"\/ib4mNsN","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118582357,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)20:00:14","name":"Yank","com":"Best flag bump","filename":"IMG_1098","ext":".jpg","w":570,"h":429,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":94,"tim":1490659214572,"time":1490659214,"md5":"iW6T3tdEXOF8oeDRi3\/AjQ==","fsize":89021,"resto":118579008,"id":"506EAJtf","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118582383,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)20:00:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118579008\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118579008<\/a>","filename":"BIggestMistakeEver","ext":".jpg","w":797,"h":822,"tn_w":121,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490659227961,"time":1490659227,"md5":"pWkub79awAfypkGtK23oPg==","fsize":54627,"resto":118579008,"id":"Alfdgybr","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118582507,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)20:01:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118582309\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118582309<\/a><br>Jews fear the finns","filename":"Finland","ext":".jpg","w":1141,"h":1600,"tn_w":89,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490659295566,"time":1490659295,"md5":"oczPVBUtqa5Bm2Wt98t1rA==","fsize":288422,"resto":118579008,"id":"T7BZ4BsS","country":"FI","m_img":1,"country_name":"Finland"},{"no":118582647,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)20:02:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118579008\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118579008<\/a><br>Which one is on the moon, faggot?","time":1490659363,"resto":118579008,"id":"z4Cus3HI","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118582873,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)20:04:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118582647\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118582647<\/a><br><br>What do you get out of being on the moon?","time":1490659475,"resto":118579008,"id":"yZeDgkqG","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118583214,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)20:07:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118579008\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118579008<\/a><br>did you just watch that ted talk about the flags where that guy says canada has the best flag ever?

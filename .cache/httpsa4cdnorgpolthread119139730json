I&#039;m a college student and have had something like that happen, when a random anon asked if slavery was happening anywhere else in the world aside from Western civilization. Anon professor, predictably replies that &quot;no, this is something that is unique to the western world.&quot; I quickly raise my hand and ask If i was incorrect in thinking that most african slaves were actually purchased from african and muslim slave traders in Africa, acquired through centuries of never ending civil war and conflict. Anon professor concedes the point, but of course feels the need to add that she was talking about plantation slavery specifically although it was never mentioned, and that it was &quot;much worse than slavery in Africa.&quot; While it would have been easy to remind her that African slaves were forced to do all the same things as plantation slaves, except without any form of shelter and in much more brutal conditions with no regard for their lives whatsoever, as they were never purchased. Point being, desk, that people really do live lives outside of your own.<\/span>","time":1491020601,"resto":119139730,"id":"UTWbrYCw","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119143581,"now":"04\/01\/17(Sat)00:24:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119143491\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119143491<\/a><br>I say as I make a stupid fucking text error. damn it","time":1491020651,"resto":119139730,"id":"UTWbrYCw","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119143674,"now":"04\/01\/17(Sat)00:25:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119143491\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119143491<\/a><br><a href=\"#p119143581\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119143581<\/a><br>Thanks for the bumps anyway have some (You)s","time":1491020713,"resto":119139730,"id":"CwZO6KZm","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119143802,"now":"04\/01\/17(Sat)00:26:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119139730\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119139730<\/a><br>Please be real.","time":1491020794,"resto":119139730,"id":"YM8oAChO","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119144003,"now":"04\/01\/17(Sat)00:28:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119142816\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119142816<\/a><br>fun fact, saudis are crypto-zionists and are in bed with israel<br><br>they all have the same shared interests, saudis should never be taken serious on this matter","filename":"1466049266106","ext":".jpg","w":501,"h":585,"tn_w":107,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491020908916,"time":1491020908,"md5":"ZRdqSphwxhFr5j+VcPTMYw==","fsize":77702,"resto":119139730,"id":"2PQYmcfx","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119144460,"now":"04\/01\/17(Sat)00:32:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119143491\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119143491<\/a><br>America had a booming economy entirely based on slave-labor.

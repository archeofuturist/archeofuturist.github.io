Socialism is an economic system; capitalism is an economic system. If you want to compare to the two correctly, you simply have to compare those elements of society which are actually related to economics: i.e. average incomes, GDP, power of industry (particularly tech and science since they require large funding). And in every case we find that capitalist countries outperform in these areas. In fact, there&#039;s a direct correlation between the freedom of markets and economic prosperity. Socialism has failed in every single country it has ever been fully implemented in. It does not work as an economic system. It&#039;s based on falty premises that fail to recognise basic truths about human behaviour.","time":1491607596,"resto":120023984,"id":"w9g4+Mlf","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":120045498,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)19:26:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"have a bump","time":1491607596,"resto":120023984,"id":"+mHQX+cd","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120045821,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)19:28:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120042932\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120042932<\/a><br>Explain how socialism transformed Russia, Central Asia and East Europe from a feudal backwater into the 2nd largest economic-industrial-science\/tech superpower on the planet in Soviet era within the span of a few decades and without any capitalist &quot;Great Depression&quot; or any recessions at all in its entire history with the exception of the initial Civil War and the Nazi Lebensraum that murdered 27 million Soviets in WW2?","filename":"12718021_10204530601983382_5341332442796473278_n","ext":".jpg","w":960,"h":498,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":64,"tim":1491607725916,"time":1491607725,"md5":"0ucTMFkVOpA4FEz6wJgdOA==","fsize":48757,"resto":120023984,"id":"E1EkU1gK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120045975,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)19:29:53","name":"Anonymous","filename":"1491602129352","ext":".png","w":1281,"h":562,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":54,"tim":1491607793699,"time":1491607793,"md5":"H3rFg+14LA2LkToi64\/Tug==","fsize":159726,"resto":120023984,"id":"eO92ZG3P","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120046212,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)19:31:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120045975\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120045975<\/a><br>Show real proof","filename":"1491605524423","ext":".jpg","w":1281,"h":562,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":54,"tim":1491607886603,"time":1491607886,"md5":"tii+iZhrk941gkK6SslvmQ==","fsize":118200,"resto":120023984,"id":"jFFfpjTk","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":120047239,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)19:38:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120045494\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120045494<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;socialism failed as an economic system<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;socialism is less efficient and productive than capitalism<\/span><br>Wrong.

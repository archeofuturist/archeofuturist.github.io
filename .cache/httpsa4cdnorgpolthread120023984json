There is no unified ideology, much like the &quot;alt right&quot; - a diverse array of ideologies fall into this category. We are united in our devotion to the betterment of humanity and to the end of destructive identity politics used by partisans on both the left and the right. It is the duty of all human beings to improve themselves and the people around them, and with a virtuous population, good policy will naturally come into place.<br><br>What does the alt-left stand for?<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Global diplomacy and cooperation<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Self improvement<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Education<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Health and fitness<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Spiritual development<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Contribution to your community and to humanity as a whole<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Vocal and physical resistance to corruption and anti-human acts<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Preservation of the world&#039;s natural beauty and its environment<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Generosity and wealth redistribution, but the people must be PROUD of this.

I see very few white males, which leads me to believe that BioWare has written it so that the white male patriarchy has attempted to make the Milky Way galaxy better by rounding up all the brown undesirables and sending them to another galaxy to make ours a better place. There are also many trans and homosexual characters, which gives credence to this hypothesis.

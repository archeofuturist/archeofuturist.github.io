When you see a very religious Muslim, like some old first generation immigrants for example, they often wear clothes in just one color, brown, grey or black for example.<br><br>Think of how autists, schizophrenics and some others dress. They usually don&#039;t have a lot of bright colors, very trendy clothes, clothes with print and images, a lot of jewelry, tattoos, piercings etc. It&#039;s as if they have an internal guide telling them to dress a certain way and don&#039;t need to read about it in a book. Whereas niggers do need to read it in a book or else they will dress like total pimps.","filename":"de04133a6a232123802e2bfd3b776994_400x400","ext":".jpg","w":400,"h":400,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493090525588,"time":1493090525,"md5":"yOVUgdDls3uJwQLxPGHlvQ==","fsize":24931,"resto":0,"id":"0IR9Sbpy","country":"SE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"one-of-many-reasons-autists-might-be-gods-chosen","country_name":"Sweden","replies":11,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":122685254,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)23:22:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"jews are gods chosen people goyim","time":1493090569,"resto":122685153,"id":"vZQ0TpzT","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122685706,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)23:26:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122685254\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122685254<\/a><br>There&#039;s also something called the ten lost tribes of Israel.

And the fragmentation into a perceived you and them was The Fall or whatever it&#039;s called. Admittedly I haven&#039;t read a lot of the Bible or the Quran. I&#039;ve tried but I feel stupid because I hardly understand anything of it. I also lack the motivation sadly. Anyway, maybe when you ascend you enter the &quot;new world order&quot;, where all the people you perceive to be other people become part of yourself fully.

Normal people, especially niggers, usually have very relaxed movements and spread out a lot more. You never see autists spread out their arms the way neurotypicals do, instead they tend to &quot;curl up as if he is trying to minimize his exposure to the exterior world&quot; as one quote says, taken from a different context. Not sure whether that might be an indication of being God&#039;s chosen. But to me it seems to imply you&#039;re clashing with the physical world as opposed to being part of it like a fish in water, and I think that might be part of what being God&#039;s chosen means.","time":1493092358,"resto":122685153,"id":"0IR9Sbpy","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":122688764,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)23:54:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122687604\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122687604<\/a><br>Sounds a lot like gnosticism desu senpai","time":1493092490,"resto":122685153,"id":"GUiqZPQW","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122689827,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)00:05:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122688764\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122688764<\/a><br>I know a little bit about gnosticism but not much.<br><br>Early on in the Quran there&#039;s a passage about the Jews in Babylon.

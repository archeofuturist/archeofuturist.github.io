As the blessed apostle says in his letter to the Ephesians, &#039;For we are members of His Body, of His flesh and of His bones&#039; (Eph. 5:30). He is not talking about some kind of &#039;spiritual&#039; and &#039;invisible&#039; man, &#039;for a spirit does not have flesh an bones&#039; (Lk. 24:39). No, he is talking of the organism possessed by a real human being, composed of flesh and nerves and bones. It is this which is nourished by the cup which is His Blood, and is fortified by the bread which is His Body. The stem of the vine takes root in the earth and eventually bears fruit, and &#039;the grain of wheat falls into the earth&#039; (Jn. 12:24), dissolves, rises again, multiplied by the all-containing Spirit of God, and finally after skilled processing, is put to human use.

What you\u2019re referring to as Linux, is in fact, GNU\/Linux, or as I\u2019ve recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX.<br>Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called \u201cLinux\u201d, and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project. There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use.<br>Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine\u2019s resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU\/Linux. All the so-called \u201cLinux\u201d distributions are really distributions of GNU\/Linux.","time":1490941090,"resto":119028045,"id":"gBgxH1++","country":"HK","country_name":"Hong Kong"},{"no":119028741,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)02:18:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119028424\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119028424<\/a><br><br>not really, even then its a lot safer than using windows which guarantees you are being spied on even while offline because it simply logs the data until it can send it later","time":1490941101,"resto":119028045,"id":"Ysn3gkM2","country":"MX","country_name":"Mexico"},{"no":119028816,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)02:19:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"Many users do not understand the difference between the kernel, which is Linux, and the whole system, which they also call \u201cLinux\u201d. The ambiguous use of the name doesn&#039;t help people understand. These users often think that Linus Torvalds developed the whole operating system in 1991, with a bit of help.<br>Programmers generally know that Linux is a kernel. But since they have generally heard the whole system called \u201cLinux\u201d as well, they often envisage a history that would justify naming the whole system after the kernel. For example, many believe that once Linus Torvalds finished writing Linux, the kernel, its users looked around for other free software to go with it, and found that (for no particular reason) most everything necessary to make a Unix-like system was already available.<br>What they found was no accident\u2014it was the not-quite-complete GNU system. The available free software added up to a complete system because the GNU Project had been working since 1984 to make one. In the The GNU Manifesto we set forth the goal of developing a free Unix-like system, called GNU. The Initial Announcement of the GNU Project also outlines some of the original plans for the GNU system. By the time Linux was started, GNU was almost finished.<br>Most free software projects have the goal of developing a particular program for a particular job. For example, Linus Torvalds set out to write a Unix-like kernel (Linux); Donald Knuth set out to write a text formatter (TeX); Bob Scheifler set out to develop a window system (the X Window System). It&#039;s natural to measure the contribution of this kind of project by specific programs that came from the project.","time":1490941172,"resto":119028045,"id":"gBgxH1++","country":"HK","country_name":"Hong Kong"},{"no":119028843,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)02:19:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"If we tried to measure the GNU Project&#039;s contribution in this way, what would we conclude? One CD-ROM vendor found that in their \u201cLinux distribution\u201d, GNU software was the largest single contingent, around 28% of the total source code, and this included some of the essential major components without which there could be no system. Linux itself was about 3%. (The proportions in 2008 are similar: in the \u201cmain\u201d repository of gNewSense, Linux is 1.5% and GNU packages are 15%.) So if you were going to pick a name for the system based on who wrote the programs in the system, the most appropriate single choice would be \u201cGNU\u201d.<br>But that is not the deepest way to consider the question. The GNU Project was not, is not, a project to develop specific software packages. It was not a project to develop a C compiler, although we did that. It was not a project to develop a text editor, although we developed one. The GNU Project set out to develop a complete free Unix-like system: GNU.<br>Many people have made major contributions to the free software in the system, and they all deserve credit for their software. But the reason it is an integrated system\u2014and not just a collection of useful programs\u2014is because the GNU Project set out to make it one. We made a list of the programs needed to make a complete free system, and we systematically found, wrote, or found people to write everything on the list. We wrote essential but unexciting components because you can&#039;t have a system without them. Some of our system components, the programming tools, became popular on their own among programmers, but we wrote many components that are not tools. We even developed a chess game, GNU Chess, because a complete system needs games too.","time":1490941197,"resto":119028045,"id":"gBgxH1++","country":"HK","country_name":"Hong Kong"},{"no":119028857,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)02:20:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119028197\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119028197<\/a><br>FPPB","time":1490941208,"resto":119028045,"id":"aAD7DFbS","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119028864,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)02:20:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"By the early 90s we had put together the whole system aside from the kernel. We had also started a kernel, the GNU Hurd, which runs on top of Mach. Developing this kernel has been a lot harder than we expected; the GNU Hurd started working reliably in 2001, but it is a long way from being ready for people to use in general.<br>Fortunately, we didn&#039;t have to wait for the Hurd, because of Linux. Once Torvalds freed Linux in 1992, it fit into the last major gap in the GNU system. People could then combine Linux with the GNU system to make a complete free system: a Linux-based version of the GNU system; the GNU\/Linux system, for short.<br>Making them work well together was not a trivial job. Some GNU components needed substantial change to work with Linux. Integrating a complete system as a distribution that would work \u201cout of the box\u201d was a big job, too. It required addressing the issue of how to install and boot the system\u2014a problem we had not tackled, because we hadn&#039;t yet reached that point. Thus, the people who developed the various system distributions did a lot of essential work. But it was work that, in the nature of things, was surely going to be done by someone.<br>The GNU Project supports GNU\/Linux systems as well as the GNU system. The FSF funded the rewriting of the Linux-related extensions to the GNU C library, so that now they are well integrated, and the newest GNU\/Linux systems use the current library release with no changes.

Without faith it&#039;s impossible to please god.<br>2. God is defined by his righteousness and holiness.<br>3. Holiness is the magnitude of righteous decisions and behaviors that god has made. It is also gods distance from man and what makes god god.<br><br>God didn&#039;t become holy to the extent that he is by observing the 10 commandments or any of the other commandments listed in the old testament or TaNaK.<br><br>Because it is impossible to act in a righteous manner without knowing first what is righteous, and god does not tell anyone what is, then you must obtain righteousness through faith. <br><br>&quot;Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness.&quot; Genesis 15:6<br><br>Now the real kicker is how you believe or have faith in god. The reason being is that out of a 1000 gods, you have no way to distinguish one from the other. You do not know his face, you do not know his characteristics, you do not know his personality. You can call him by name, but any mistreatment of his name will condemn you. Not only that, but his name is only known in part: YHVH or YHWH to be exact. Psalms has david saying that the first part of his name is Yah. And that&#039;s all we know.<br><br>Even if you call out to god, he will most likely not answer. Which leaves you talking to yourself or some ideas you believe might have been put in your head by god. What are you going to have faith in? Is it what you believe god has said to you or is it what you were told by men what god wants you to do?<br><br>You cannot have faith in some self conceived idea of god. It must be faith in god directly, but you have no way to distinguish him from the noise in your head, and you do not know any distinguishing features of him through experience that you can have faith in him.

class=\"quote\">&gt;The concept of Limpieza de sangre, was a significant barrier for many Spaniard to emigrate to the Americas, since some form of proof of not having recent Moorish or Jewish

Candidates for office and their spouses had to obtain a certificate of purity that proved that they had no Jewish or Muslim ancestors and in New Spain, proof of whiteness and absence of any in the lineage who engaged in work with their hands. Additionally, as early as the sixteenth century, shortly after the Spanish colonization of America was initiated, several regulations were enacted in the Laws of the Indies to prevent Jews and Muslims and their descendants to emigrate and settle in the overseas colonies.<\/span>","time":1493047553,"resto":122592592,"id":"by9pn7nf","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":122597430,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)11:28:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122596720\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122596720<\/a><br>it really wasn&#039;t","filename":"hre13thcent","ext":".png","w":800,"h":1041,"tn_w":96,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493047736682,"time":1493047736,"md5":"ToXVuKbwposYsLqHkqZR0w==","fsize":702631,"resto":122592592,"id":"G6nDHiJA","country":"GB","m_img":1,"country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122597503,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)11:29:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122594779\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122594779<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Germany<\/span>","time":1493047769,"resto":122592592,"id":"keB0TqWC","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":122597876,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)11:32:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122597430\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122597430<\/a><br><a href=\"#p122597078\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122597078<\/a><br>What&#039;s feudalism?

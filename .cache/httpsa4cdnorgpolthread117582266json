The thing about having a really shitty life is, it isn&#039;t all pathos and high drama. It&#039;s mostly just really mundane.<br><br>For example, when I was in foster care I was offloaded on a foster home where I witnessed my foster &#039;mother&#039;, a 300 lb woman, smack one of her 4 year old charges to the ground and stomp on him repeatedly. I used a payphone at my school the next morning to call and report this. CPS did a thorough investigation, which consisted of sending a worker out to ask her &quot;Did you do that shit?&quot; My foster mother denied it, and was more than willing to prove it by letting the case worker examine the child who was the victim. <br><br>Except she substituted another one of her charges, a 7-year old. 4, 7, what&#039;s the difference? Anyway she was cleared and I, the new arrival, was sent back to her care the next night. The only obvious snitch, mind you. I had already heard the woman&#039;s reputation for having older kids discipline the younger ones, so I had a shank made from a snapple bottle on me, just in case.<br><br>If this was Hollywood, when the two oldest kids in her care crept into my room that night, I would have taken their throats out, or alternatively, lost a fight, gotten ass-raped, and somehow become stronger for it. What happened was, the two oldest kids in her care crept into my room that night, I brandished a shank made from a snapple bottle at them, and...nothing fucking happened. They left, I wasn&#039;t placed there again, months went buy, I was later committed to a psyche ward largely on the strength of that woman&#039;s testimony, I was a minor at the time so it&#039;s not even on my record, nothing. <br><br>The psyche ward wasn&#039;t even that bad. I was only committed for 28 hours or so, the bed was comfy, I got a day off school I got to spend reading a few general interest magazines and a Reader&#039;s Digest condensed novel.

I wake up, usually hungover, and roll over to my computer and wipe the crust out of my eyes as I stare at the blinding glow of my screen. I play something like CS or TF2 for a minute or two, something that&#039;s fast-paced enough to wake me up, without having to think to much. After that I&#039;ll sneak my mom&#039;s debit card out of her purse and go buy Mcdonalds breakfast. By the time I finish I still dont know what the fuck I&#039;m going to do for the rest of the day. So I pack a few bowls and of course get fucking high as shit. That&#039;s when I&#039;m in the mood for something more intellectually stimulating, like a jRPG... the stories in those usually never let me down, and being the hero in fictional universe is just the thing I need for the soulcrushing reality taht is my life. After a few hours I loose interest, and usually end up plugging my fleshlight before passing out into a nice afternoon weednap. When I wake up it usually takes a few hours to climb out of bed anyway, so it&#039;s usually dark by then. So I&#039;ll play something that&#039;s more fitting for night time -- something scary, dark &amp; moody -- Doom 3 for example, love replaying that one, I&#039;ve played threw it 20 times in the past 8 years. A pint of Captain later and it&#039;s basically like Im on the martian soil, blowing away demons &amp; monsters with my shot gun, like I&#039;m actually a space marine. I go to bed still fealing unfulfilled, like Ive been living the same day (though slightly varied) for the past 20 years.

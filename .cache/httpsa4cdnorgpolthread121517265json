After all, while 2016 was, in many ways, fashion\u2019s most inclusive year yet, some recent Gucci campaigns have been exclusively white.<br><br>Now the campaign, called \u201cSoul Scene,\u201d featuring only black models and dancers and designed to look like a late-1960s black dance party, is here. But while at first blush it seems like genuine cultural inclusion, a refreshing gesture from an international label, whose soul is it selling?<br><br>Gucci calls the campaign \u201can exploration of the flamboyance and self-expression of men and women who challenge the conventions of society through performance, art and dance.\u201d It cites as inspiration the work of the Malian artist Malick Sidib\u00e9 and the Northern Soul movement in 1960s Britain. Shot by Glen Luchford, the images have a gritty filter and a slight sepia tint. They look, almost, like the real thing. Almost.<br><br>One couldn\u2019t blame you for being fooled. There is a cheap, mylar curtain in the background and linoleum on the floors. Someone has hung a printed bedsheet up as a de facto backdrop. Are you sure this isn\u2019t your Aunt Marva\u2019s wild birthday party in 1967? Black faces smile widely in the photos; people are doing splits and kicks with wild abandon. This sure looks like soul, right?<br><br>http:\/\/archive.is\/IiBMP","filename":"Gucci","ext":".jpg","w":768,"h":496,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":161,"tim":1492430196480,"time":1492430196,"md5":"51hYv326koAgiwLcmNf5Jg==","fsize":123594,"resto":0,"id":"i5cMvRul","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"new-gucci-campaign-features-only-black-models","country_name":"United States","replies":7,"images":3,"unique_ips":6},{"no":121517295,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)07:57:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121517265\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121517265<\/a>","filename":"Gucci2","ext":".jpg","w":675,"h":436,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":80,"tim":1492430222257,"time":1492430222,"md5":"ZqDAOfloHM69ahtgRJnheg==","fsize":101474,"resto":121517265,"id":"i5cMvRul","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121517312,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)07:57:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121517295\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121517295<\/a>","filename":"Gucci3","ext":".jpg","w":427,"h":648,"tn_w":82,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492430230856,"time":1492430230,"md5":"TNDehs9peKMv6QHWX1kNeA==","fsize":97997,"resto":121517265,"id":"i5cMvRul","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121517391,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)07:58:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121517265\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121517265<\/a><br>not like they can afford it lmao","time":1492430285,"resto":121517265,"id":"ilAMCQdS","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":121518137,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)08:07:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121517265\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121517265<\/a><br>bump","time":1492430845,"resto":121517265,"id":"HInDrOIf","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121518375,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)08:10:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121517265\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121517265<\/a><br>Dem sho got soul an riddum","filename":"Bubble Sisters","ext":".jpg","w":450,"h":300,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1492431027988,"time":1492431027,"md5":"43OqK4RgXYrznvxSL5lmKQ==","fsize":38703,"resto":121517265,"id":"SyxdhQ2I","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121518630,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)08:13:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121517265\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121517265<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;All black campaign<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Liberals still say they&#039;re racist<\/span><br><br>When will companies learn to stop pandering to SJW&#039;s<br><br>I saw an ad for the bay and it had two gay dad&#039;s as the parents.

It&#039;s a frequently cited talking point I see on far-right message boards, but I never really found a book that discussed it. The Myth of the Andalusian Paradise very briefly mentioned the Jews opened the gates for the Muslims in one of the battles, so I know it&#039;s true and not some outlandish conspiracy theory. Jews collaborating with Muslims would tie this all together very nicely for me.","filename":"juden","ext":".gif","w":500,"h":275,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":137,"tim":1490603087338,"time":1490603087,"md5":"8Gu20LTzrKHCztbpfFE5tQ==","fsize":781783,"resto":0,"id":"PbFFo\/Gk","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"are-there-any-books-that-are-similar-to-culture","country_name":"Canada","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

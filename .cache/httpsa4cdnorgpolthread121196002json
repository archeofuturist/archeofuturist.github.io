It may refer either to faith that is an expression of obedi- ence or to obedience that is an expression of faith. Possibly, Paul intended both meanings. Clearly it is the bringing of persons to faith in Christ that is the primary goal of the Pauline mission. It is no coincidence that Paul can refer synonymously to the Jews\u2019 unbelief in 11:20 and to their disobedience in 11:31 (Cranfield 1979: 66). Elsewhere in Romans, however, Paul uses \u2018obedience\u2019 in the more conventional sense (5:19; 6:16; 15:18; 16:19). An interesting parallel occurs in 2 Cor 9:13, where Paul says that the Corinthians\u2019 generosity is an expres- sion of their \u2018obedience to the confession of the Gospel of Christ\u2019. The fact that Paul incl- udes in this mission the Roman Christians themselves (v. 6) indicates at the very least that he is talking about more than the evangel- ization of Gentiles.<br><br>Sola Fide bTFO by Oxford","time":1492254799,"resto":121196002,"id":"nM03xZ49","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121199889,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)07:15:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121199752\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121199752<\/a><br>From Oxford Commentary on Pauline Epistles page 65<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The link to the remaining, paraenetic section of Romans (chs. 12\u201315) has been obscured by the Protestant inclination to consider justification in exclusively juridical terms. The notion that Christians are different from others primarily in their legal standing before God owes much to a traditional (Augustinian\/Lutheran) (mis)reading of Rom 7\u20138. The Pauline meaning of \u2018justifica- tion\u2019 is much broader and evidences a quite different eschatological orientation (see ROM 8). The word dikaioun (\u2018to justify\u2019; first used in 2:13 and then repeatedly throughout chs. 2\u201310) means literally \u2018to righteous\u2019; it comes from the same root as dikaiosun \u0304e, \u2018righteousness.\u2019 It means both \u2018to treat as righteous\u2019 and \u2018to make righteous\u2019 (K \u0308asemann 1980: 25). In other words, God both forgives sin and converts sinners in \u2018righteous- ing\u2019 the unrighteous. The relational character of righteousness (e.g. seen as God\u2019s faithfulness to Israel, above) covers both being established and being equipped as a fit partner in right relation- ship (e.g. in 8:2\u20134). The same point is made by calling the gospel \u2018the power of God for salvation\u2019. <\/span><br><br>Sola Fide and PSA btfo","time":1492254909,"resto":121196002,"id":"nM03xZ49","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121199991,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)07:16:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121199374\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121199374<\/a>","filename":"1492119541467","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":500,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492254986766,"time":1492254986,"md5":"F8rCt4h4qymN688nfKq+Vw==","fsize":64176,"resto":121196002,"id":"5HI3AFaY","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121200033,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)07:17:04","name":"Ron Paul","com":"God isn&#039;t real, prove me wrong.

(The highest concentration of parallels occurs in the Wisdom of Solomon, almost cer- tainly known to Paul.) Like Paul, Jewish apolo- gists characteristically attacked Gentile idolatry and sexual misconduct. (\u2018For the idea of making idols was the beginning of fornication\u2019, Wis 14:12; cf. vv. 22\u20137.) Some also claim that behind ch. 2 lies an otherwise unknown Hellenistic synagogue sermon (see below). It is reasonable to suppose that Paul used stock materials to construct a foundation upon which the more distinctive elements of his argument would be built.

The notion that Christians are different from others primarily in their legal standing before God owes much to a traditional (Augustinian\/Lutheran) (mis)reading of Rom 7\u20138. The Pauline meaning of \u2018justifica- tion\u2019 is much broader and evidences a quite different eschatological orientation (see ROM 8). The word dikaioun (\u2018to justify\u2019; first used in 2:13 and then repeatedly throughout chs. 2\u201310) means literally \u2018to righteous\u2019; it comes from the same root as dikaiosun \u0304e, \u2018righteousness.\u2019 It means both \u2018to treat as righteous\u2019 and \u2018to make righteous\u2019 (K \u0308asemann 1980: 25). In other words, God both forgives sin and converts sinners in \u2018righteous- ing\u2019 the unrighteous. The relational character of righteousness (e.g. seen as God\u2019s faithfulness to Israel, above) covers both being established and being equipped as a fit partner in right relation- ship (e.g. in 8:2\u20134). The same point is made by calling the gospel \u2018the power of God for salvation\u2019.-OXFORD Commentary on Pauline Episles page 65<br><br>Protestants hate this","time":1492260836,"resto":121196002,"id":"nM03xZ49","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121207506,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)08:56:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121207067\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121207067<\/a><br><br>sad but true","time":1492260996,"resto":121196002,"id":"PxRB0CRF","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":121207535,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)08:56:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121204726\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121204726<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;third reich<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;no crimes<\/span><br>it did end with a boom, lots of them.","time":1492261015,"resto":121196002,"id":"\/RmMa+8l","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"},{"no":121207585,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)08:57:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121207506\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121207506<\/a><br>Wmaf IRL<br><br>Sad but true","filename":"image","ext":".jpg","w":900,"h":1200,"tn_w":93,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492261057444,"time":1492261057,"md5":"FEMl3kzzxwkuU41tMitUMQ==","fsize":290390,"resto":121196002,"id":"nM03xZ49","country":"GB","m_img":1,"country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121208369,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)09:07:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121207585\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121207585<\/a><br><br>Another sad fact is that most Christians don&#039;t even remember their Gods name..<br>Jews are the ultimate traitors with the intention to forget and erease his name..","time":1492261629,"resto":121196002,"id":"vWflKRZp","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":121208648,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)09:10:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121198240\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121198240<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;hurr not molesting kids as a priest is heresy durr<\/span>","time":1492261816,"resto":121196002,"id":"V1asYLfq","country":"HU","country_name":"Hungary"},{"no":121208720,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)09:11:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121197888\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121197888<\/a><br>trips of truth, Orthodox is gods chosen","filename":"7615703e832d17248525b3a5b0d9904535558d42ceb45bf0d9a0000832bf5073_1 (2)","ext":".jpg","w":799,"h":667,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":104,"tim":1492261866479,"time":1492261866,"md5":"WA6bVB2kXqSz4Y+zOmuXrg==","fsize":140971,"resto":121196002,"id":"9Ug8kEiD","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121208743,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)09:11:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121199374\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121199374<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;a priest says a dumb thing<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;well i guess its time to abandone protestantism<\/span>","time":1492261878,"resto":121196002,"id":"V1asYLfq","country":"HU","country_name":"Hungary"},{"no":121209428,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)09:19:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121196002\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121196002<\/a><br>Sorry ass, men dette er noe du sier bare fordi du er norsk.

Assad is probably not even linked to any torture, he has always been vocally against it, he had a western education. Most likely the men from his father&#039;s old guard are the ones doing the torture. Also torturing is mostly done for al Qaeda and Muslim Brotherhood terrotists. Leaked documents from the government have actually shown how the army suspected a branch of the government was torturing people, and asked them to stop, which makes us speculate its not some common practice within the army.","time":1491454129,"resto":119703159,"id":"FYi8QUx\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119706869,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)00:52:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119703159\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119703159<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;suck at democracy.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;democracy is a universal value or always good<\/span>","time":1491454372,"resto":119703159,"id":"7O4qIdaU","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119707051,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)00:54:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"democracy is shit anyway","time":1491454481,"resto":119703159,"id":"05lCLx8v","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119707405,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)00:58:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119703159\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119703159<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;they suck at democracy.<\/span><br><br>Democracy is bullshit, it&#039;s just a smokescreen to pacify people and make them believe they have a say in their nation&#039;s future.","time":1491454709,"resto":119703159,"id":"g3\/b2ZiS","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

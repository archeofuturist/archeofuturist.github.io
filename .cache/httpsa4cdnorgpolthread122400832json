Nothing in the way of debates, and a lot of his material is very &quot;buy my book&quot;, but... unlike a lot of that tripe I can&#039;t actually argue with what he&#039;s delivering. Really just a matter of presentation.<br><br>Dr. Michael Brown if you want to watch some debates of a jew blasting jews.<br><br>Ravi Zacharias if you want some more eloquence without necessarily abandoning intellect. Again, not much in the way of debates, but good sermons.<br><br>Dr. John Lenox was mentioned. Love this guy, but do yourself a favor. Watch one of his 1-2 hour presentations, and 1 or 2 of his debates. You&#039;ll have seen it all. It&#039;s good stuff, and honestly there is only ever so much that really needs to be said, so I can&#039;t fault the guy, but if you&#039;re hungry for more you&#039;re going to have to find someone else.<br><br>Gary Habermas. A few debates. Some good ones with Anthony Flew, where Flew was a better skeptic than modern nu-atheists, who are just cynics. One in particular you might want to check out, though less a debate, involved Habermas, Lenox, and Christopher Hitchens. It&#039;s probably about what you would expect, but interesting since Christopher couldn&#039;t lean on his typical emotional appeals, even though he tried. Out of his league, but the community accepted him gracefully.<br><br>Also of note, check out Craig&#039;s debate with Dr. Sean Carrol. Carrol isn&#039;t a nu-atheist, and by virtue of taking his opponents seriously, rather than deferring to mockery of emotional appeals, the debate was all the better for it. REALLY put Craig&#039;s understanding of the science and philosophy behind it to the test. Would love to see more stuff like this, but it seems to reveal more the philosophic anemia in academia that a professional theologian is standing pretty competently with the professional theoretical physicist in his own field. Carrol did a great job, though.

Not the norm, but it&#039;s possible. <br><br>Antony Flew is an example. He is a legit intellectual, and embraced atheism as an act of rebellion in his youth. <br><br>When he thought about it more, he eventually disavowed atheism and argued that the evidence suggests there is indeed some kind of higher agency responsible for bringing about life. <br><br>So, please do not stereotype atheists, and do not make fun of them for being intellectually impaired.

Absolutely nothing like the nuatheism, and by large, an honest skeptic. But check out some of his debates with Habermas. The two were well acquainted, so it is interesting to see some of his more enthusiastic responses that would conclude with &quot;it&#039;s strange isn&#039;t it...&quot;.<br><br>As if you could see the gears turning, but right as he gets to the conclusion they just stop, like something was interrupting their process and he would be waiting for Habermas to take him over that one last little step. No objection to Habermas&#039; argument.<br><br>So with that said, where I appreciate Flew, he&#039;s actually a really good case of demonstrating that sort of impairment you&#039;re describing. The separation really just occurs in delivery. Flew could stand to insist there is something about the resurrection account that cries out for explanation. Your typical nuatheist by comparison won&#039;t even self reflect on the absurdity of mass-hallucinations that by their own account would be miraculous, nevermind fail to address all of &#039;the data&#039;.

I don&#039;t adopt the agnostic theist\/atheist thing, but that&#039;s really the jist of it. Flew may have leaned far toward atheism, but he didn&#039;t divorce himself from reason.<br><br>More importantly, it brings up a good point.

Oh believe you me, us Poles are ITCHING for a war with USA. We will fucking ANNIHILATE your dirty country. There wouldn&#039;t be a square meter of American soil that has running water, electricity, or petrol that isn&#039;t on fire, once our airforce and navy is done bombarding your defenseless country. Then, our army boys would swoop in, raping your women, and killing EVERY American pig shit they see. When Poland&#039;s done with you, we will have committed acts of genocide. Of course no one is gonna do shit about it.","filename":"glorious american military","ext":".jpg","w":400,"h":535,"tn_w":186,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493761651062,"time":1493761651,"md5":"e+tcZXowk9IhXwHQ4U6qNA==","fsize":46346,"resto":0,"id":"Hbk1U2Du","country":"PL","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"poland-couldnt-singlehandedlydestroy-usa-in-a","country_name":"Poland","replies":15,"images":5,"unique_ips":14},{"no":123824715,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)17:48:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;another thread about poland<\/span><br>please stop","time":1493761693,"resto":123824630,"id":"7KGjgvpe","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":123824827,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)17:48:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"slavs are slavES","time":1493761737,"resto":123824630,"id":"JSru2MTy","country":"CH","country_name":"Switzerland"},{"no":123824878,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)17:49:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"k","time":1493761755,"resto":123824630,"id":"9mlYeiV+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123825052,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)17:50:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"DEATH TO POLISH SCUM","time":1493761829,"resto":123824630,"id":"PvV6bvue","country":"UA","country_name":"Ukraine"},{"no":123825406,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)17:53:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123824630\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123824630<\/a><br>European countries always overcompensate for their tiny militaries by sending their tallest soldiers to every photo op with the US, it reeks of inferiority complex <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;inb4 some half assed manlet shitpost<\/span><br>all the tall US soldiers are at the Korean DMZ, Europe isn&#039;t even relevant enough to defend with our tall soldiers","filename":"image","ext":".jpg","w":900,"h":1350,"tn_w":83,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493761988142,"time":1493761988,"md5":"W817e37x8ZTedTd3\/5yJ2g==","fsize":532560,"resto":123824630,"id":"jIIbR\/Ww","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":123825453,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)17:53:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123824630\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123824630<\/a><br>REEEEEEEEEEEEEEE","time":1493762010,"resto":123824630,"id":"uBxD+p9f","country":"CZ","country_name":"Czech Republic"},{"no":123825585,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)17:54:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123824630\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123824630<\/a><br>Is there a lot of English-speaking\/speakers in regular Polish day-to-day life.

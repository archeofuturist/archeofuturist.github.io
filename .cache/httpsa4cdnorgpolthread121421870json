I played poker professionally for 3 years on my own bankroll. Played for many years beyond that and always won every year but only spent 3 years doing 40+ hours of poker a week (so &quot;professional&quot;).<br><br>Poker is basically just one giant IQ test. As a lifestyle it&#039;s awesome for awhile and then it gets very cold and isolating. <br><br>You relate to even fewer people then you did before you were a poker pro. <br><br>Money and time spent acquiring money basically becomes an irrelevant concern. But you spend your entire life surrounded by degenerates, criminals, hookers, etc. <br><br>You become a part of the underworld whether you want to or not. Your lifestyle is basically funded by the suffering of dumb people. Your skill as a player and ability to sit at the same table forever and never run out of chips is what props up and enables games for casino operators to run. Most game runners are some kind of mob captain and they use that money to go and fund more crime. <br><br>You have basically no responsibility at all and you&#039;re always flush with cash. Even if you somehow go broke there&#039;s always people offering to stake you. If you don&#039;t feel the gamble in you one day you can just take them up on a stake and not even need to play with your own money anymore. Leads to hedonism\/nihilism pretty fast. Stake isn&#039;t a loan it&#039;s a form of gambling for the staker, they have you gamble their money for them and you earn a commission on the winnings. There&#039;s no obligation to pay anything back if you lose.<br><br>You can go anywhere in the world at any time but never find your community there. Besides Vegas during the WSOP, but then you can&#039;t relate to other degenerate geniuses over poker either cause they&#039;re all trying to gain an edge over you and learn your style for when you meet in tournament.","time":1492392285,"resto":121421870,"id":"nF57BEEl","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121456113,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)21:25:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121451490\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121451490<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;trained myself to not think as all<\/span><br><a href=\"#p121452549\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121452549<\/a><br>that&#039;s an essential magical exercise, called tabula rasa<br>franz bardon teaches it well and everything it can come with in &quot;initiation to hermetics&quot;<br>google it +pdf keyword to get it for free","filename":"1481847480727","ext":".jpg","w":900,"h":717,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":99,"tim":1492392314182,"time":1492392314,"md5":"HdQ3bHiZtpeqJ5hzcGwTNg==","fsize":392833,"resto":121421870,"id":"+wlIBEYe","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":121456149,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)21:25:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121455601\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121455601<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;you&#039;re an old soul(high iq)<\/span><br>i get so fucking sick of hearing that","time":1492392325,"resto":121421870,"id":"Jk7l3uzQ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121456151,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)21:25:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121427905\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121427905<\/a><br>That\u00b4s degenerate.","time":1492392326,"resto":121421870,"id":"wBp3yeEL","country":"AR","country_name":"Argentina"},{"no":121456316,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)21:26:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121456035\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121456035<\/a><br>sounds like a jew test","time":1492392388,"resto":121421870,"id":"Jk7l3uzQ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121456351,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)21:26:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"hurr durr durr mai eye-q iz over 9000 and muh e-peen is 300 pheet lawng","time":1492392401,"resto":121421870,"id":"Jh5i\/3Rw","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121456408,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)21:27:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121454761\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121454761<\/a><br>They don&#039;t.

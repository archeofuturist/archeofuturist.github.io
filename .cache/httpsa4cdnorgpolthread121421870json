I cut that after a week, next was stratterra, they started me at 10, bumped it up to 100 after several months, before ritalin, which I stopped after a month, then guanfacine, after one week I stopped it. Got a formal diagnosis and switched doctors then bam. Adderall. Its low but I&#039;ll keep bumping it up. Modafinil is the one I really want though. less side effects. but that&#039;ll be a few months.","time":1492385780,"resto":121421870,"id":"aa+EHh8U","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121439173,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)19:37:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121421870\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121421870<\/a><br>I have a genius level mate and he&#039;s probably the most socially inept person I know.<br><br>And I go on 4chan!","time":1492385839,"resto":121421870,"id":"UhxkwhME","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":121439314,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)19:38:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121435248\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121435248<\/a><br>How hard is it to get into the field with absolutely zero background?","time":1492385895,"resto":121421870,"id":"aeh6my6Y","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":121439354,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)19:38:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121439011\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121439011<\/a><br>I guess it&#039;s all about getting the right doc.","time":1492385909,"resto":121421870,"id":"YMfmP\/B2","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121439531,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)19:39:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121421870\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121421870<\/a><br>It&#039;s an optional extra fitted as standard on the higher-end model.","filename":"32697C8700000578-3502081-image-a-44_1458526407096","ext":".jpg","w":306,"h":466,"tn_w":82,"tn_h":124,"tim":1492385967377,"time":1492385967,"md5":"SVsoiB9sOzmHFw\/lv\/5H1w==","fsize":34587,"resto":121421870,"id":"wOlQhZOF","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":121439709,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)19:40:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121421870\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121421870<\/a><br>People with High IQ are more prone to mental illnesses<br>Its a gift and a curse at the same time <br>We are Monkeys on a lava filled rock, flying through space, who live in a jew system, where we have to do shit we dont want to, in order to buy shit we dont need, to impress people we dont like <br>Smart People cant get over that fact, and get depressed","time":1492386033,"resto":121421870,"id":"zXaQNjDW","country":"AT","country_name":"Austria"},{"no":121439990,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)19:42:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121421870\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121421870<\/a><br><br>Tfw too smart to not ignore Jewish agenda, but surrounded by low frequency normies being dumbed down and distracted by Jewish agenda.","filename":"1474174892944s","ext":".jpg","w":236,"h":229,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":121,"tim":1492386138105,"time":1492386138,"md5":"QEpv4QEQ4o0opATNLwEx4g==","fsize":8893,"resto":121421870,"id":"wzIJWE8\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121440342,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)19:44:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121439709\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121439709<\/a><br>you go be a monkey then atheist, go eat you shit<br><br>i am not a monkey. we are created by god, tricked by a fallen powerful spirit being, betrayed by our created mates. we live on a plane a dimension, not space.

There are 50 states, each state with completely different laws and types of people. If there wasn&#039;t such a system California would literally win the election every time, which is overwhelmingly liberal and unrepresentative of America as a whole. Plus like 60% of people in cali are illegal shitskins who vote democratic because the dems don&#039;t do shit about them in return for the vote. GTFO. I hate going to LA cuz of that alone.","time":1491716937,"resto":120245403,"id":"n0IlZ0Zx","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]}

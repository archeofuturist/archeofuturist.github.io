This has been puzzling me for quite a while now.<br>Billions of dollars gets spent every year just so that brands could show their ads on tv\/youtube\/streets\/websites, even though nobody pays attention to any of the ads, I&#039;ll always skip your youtube ad after the five seconds period, even before knowing your company&#039;s name or what does it sell. I&#039;ll always switch the channel when the show takes a break to show some ads. <br>I&#039;ve never seen or heard of anybody seeing an ad about something and immediately going out to buy it.<br>Seems like wasted money to be honest, plus most of the internet is so over-riddled with ads and every website always shows a hundred ad banners and a hundred popups and this makes the consumer eager to just close all of the popups\/banners out of frustration instead of taking the time to see what they&#039;re advertising. It all seems pointless to me.<br>Why don&#039;t the companies use the advertising money to actually improve the product they&#039;re selling or build another branch or whatever?","filename":"image","ext":".jpg","w":242,"h":258,"tn_w":234,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493072699791,"time":1493072699,"md5":"2MIQLmTvE5vENVbjL2Qoqw==","fsize":12713,"resto":0,"id":"9Eg0P9SM","country":"EG","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"what-is-the-point-of-advertising-especially-for","country_name":"Egypt","replies":2,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":122648498,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)18:27:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122648234\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122648234<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;what is the point of the thing which allows Jews to siphon billions out of the economy<\/span><br><br>sure am glad they reminded me that Pepsi exists","time":1493072821,"resto":122648234,"id":"5zpxdlZY","country":"JP","country_name":"Japan"},{"no":122648624,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)18:27:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122648234\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122648234<\/a><br>Same reason political parties group together and say the same shit across the jew tube and in interviews. <br><br>Couldn&#039;t they just quit all that shit and work on making the USA better? <br><br>Nope they have to stay on top of the propaganda to keep you in line to buy their product. <br><br>t.

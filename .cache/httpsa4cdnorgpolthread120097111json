You people do understand that, right? As far as the republic goes, we are watching the seven seals being opened.<br><br>Throw your maps of North America out, boys. They are going to be worthless soon. You will discover that the US is a bit like Somalia on maps. You look at Somalia and if you think about it, you realize its not any credible definition of a nation.<br><br>Its just that when you make and look at the map, there is a space there between existing nations.<br><br>We are now the moribund space between Mexico and Canada. In short order, there will be nothing left. Some roads, buildings, yeah. But no, with 20 trillion in debt and more spending coming for, say, 60 million in missiles whenever you see video of wounded kids. Yeah, that sort of impulse mentality doesnt allow said nation to exist on a reasonable ledger.<br><br>This thing is going down. We were wrong. Lets get over it, prepare and brace for impact. We barely had a chance to begin with, and its becoming clear that chance just walked out the door.<br><br>Its not Syria. Its not laying down for mayors and judges. Its not Bannon being edged out. Its all that and Bannon being edged out before a 100 days are even up as busloads of creepy Bush-ites and Jews suddenly show up.<br><br>Gentlemen, we are looking at classic establishment neocon behavior. We just elected the third Bush and its time to get ready for it. By 2020, its not even going to matter. Forget polling places, just get the hell out of the cities.","filename":"1234857285472","ext":".jpg","w":1443,"h":1080,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1491633123254,"time":1491633123,"md5":"8Q5dqNnunaUAfQYBbDVwUA==","fsize":414952,"resto":120097111,"id":"wmnk2KTX","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":120100034,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)02:42:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120097111\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120097111<\/a><br>That&#039;s a possibility , i guess.","time":1491633740,"resto":120097111,"id":"JnH6brsw","country":"UY","country_name":"Uruguay"}]}

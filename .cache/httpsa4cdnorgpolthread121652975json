If Hillary wouldn&#039;t have gotten rid of Bernie, who&#039;s also against the establishment, and he&#039;d become president, could an alt-left have existed? Reforming corrupt globalist institutions like the EU while maintaing diversity and international cooperation, getting rid of unneeded insitutions, protests against proxy wars, finding a sunstainable solution for the immigrant crisis instead of just closing the borders, etc.","filename":"bernie","ext":".jpg","w":3906,"h":2604,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1492499360691,"time":1492499360,"md5":"41EJi89uypWUsKy0F4wSwA==","fsize":778064,"resto":0,"id":"2fcehFQp","country":"JP","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"quick-question-the-altright-as-a-counter-movement","country_name":"Japan","replies":3,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":121653598,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)03:17:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121652975\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121652975<\/a><br>An alt-left couldn&#039;t be a thing because the left is more and more becoming the norm.","time":1492499866,"resto":121652975,"id":"al4LXQmf","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":121653872,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)03:22:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"No, because Bernie is a sellout cuck who never intended to win.

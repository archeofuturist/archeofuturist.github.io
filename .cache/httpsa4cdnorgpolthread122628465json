It is a vital repair and maintenance agent that is produced almost solely by your own body and without it you would die very quickly. It is so vital to you that you cannot afford to rely on your diet to supply it, hence why cholesterol is not absorbed from your food in more than miniscule amounts and instead produced internally. Cholesterol does not actually kill you in most instances, but due to it&#039;s repair function it is heavily present whenever an underlying problem is causing damage to your system. You can use food products to reduce the cholesterol in your system, which typically means you die from whatever damage the cholesterol was trying to mitigate unless you actually fix the problem itself. The single biggest money maker of the pharma industry is cholesterol reducing medication, making up more than half of their total profit.<br><br>Proteins are required for both animals and plants to not fall apart. Fat is energy storage for animals, as it is easier to store and transport. Sugar is energy storage for plants, who do not need to keep volume low or move their own weight, but have to be as energy efficient as possible, which is easier with sugar. Saying that plants have neither fat (oil), protein or sugar is an outright lie and only a complete moron or a deliberate troll would make such a claim.","time":1493066256,"resto":122628465,"id":"fKGGOtCb","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":122634290,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)16:38:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt; everyone salty as hell because they don&#039;t have enough willpower to get their fat asses to eat healthier<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; completely delusional because of 24\/7 basement exposure to infowars meme<\/span><br>depressing","time":1493066288,"resto":122628465,"id":"EP3nVxZ6","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":122634319,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)16:38:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122633653\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122633653<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; I need literally HUNDREDS of times more B12 than normal to survive.<\/span><br>So therefore you need to supplement...<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; If I cut out meat and just took a multivitamin, I wouldn&#039;t have made it. <\/span><br>Why?","time":1493066304,"resto":122628465,"id":"ZlvXvGuU","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":122634320,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)16:38:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122628465\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122628465<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;islam prohibits pork<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;hans is now promoting meatless diet<\/span><br><br>It&#039;s not even subtle anymore.","time":1493066304,"resto":122628465,"id":"lR9cXw+g","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122634392,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)16:39:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"Fats and proten -- OP name drops them in like they&#039;re toxic chemicals, but they&#039;re two of the most basic nutrients that are completely essential for human survival.","time":1493066343,"resto":122628465,"id":"aClgVuI+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122634590,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)16:40:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"Yeaaaah moronic Fritz, you are citing 1000 yo papers that you barely understand dear ...

Ileana Ros-Lehtinen said Friday she believes a major White House shake-up is coming and that President Trump&#039;s chief strategist Steve Bannon may be on the way out.<br><br>&quot;I think his days are numbered in that administration. And I think profound changes will be coming,&quot; she said on a Miami radio show this morning, predicting the &quot;shake-up&quot; will occur in the next few months. <br><br>Ros-Lehtinen said it would be &quot;welcome news for the nation&quot; if Bannon exits the White House. Earlier this week, the White House announced Bannon was no longer serving on the National Security Council. <br><br>She declined to specify her issue with the former Breitbart CEO, but seemed to point to his views on immigration and refugees.<br><br>&quot;His views are not in line with our country. We are an inclusive country that welcomes different points of views. His ties to certain groups are very worrisome,&quot; she said.&quot;<br><br>http:\/\/insider.foxnews.com\/2017\/04\/<wbr>07\/gop-lawmaker-ros-lehtinen-florid<wbr>a-steve-bannon-white-house-days-are<wbr>-numbered<br><br>Cuckservatives and kikes are about to win.

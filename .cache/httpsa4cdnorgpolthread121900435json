Their bigger problem is actually replacing O&#039;Reilly with Tucker and Tucker with Bolling. Tucker&#039;s great as a followup to O&#039;Reilly, but putting him in O&#039;Reilly&#039;s slot is downright foolish, in my estimation. He just doesn&#039;t work as well there. <br><br>Say what you will about O&#039;Reilly, but he&#039;s led and carried that network for many years, and he had a gravitas and presence that&#039;s not easily replaced. They&#039;ve got nobody in the stable, as evidenced by the fact that they used Bolling, a C- broadcaster, and gave him a prime time slot. <br><br>They needed to have people in the stable to prepare for this, and they didn&#039;t have jack shit when the moment came. Were I them, I&#039;d have given Ingraham one of those prime time slots, maybe Cavuto, then went with a fresh face. <br><br>They&#039;re going to be fine, though, in that they&#039;re the only conservative-leaning, non-liberal media outlet and as such will retain their audience. They&#039;re not at risk of totally going away in the slightest. <br><br>They&#039;ll figure it out. It&#039;s another liberal wet dream where they scream &quot;IT&#039;S THE DEATH OF X!&quot; at the top of their lungs, and nothing ever actually comes of it.","time":1492638201,"resto":121900435,"id":"Ok20fGSP","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121901680,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)17:44:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121900435\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121900435<\/a><br><br>This is the Tucker Channel now.","time":1492638276,"resto":121900435,"id":"2DtQNZ3p","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121901972,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)17:46:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121901490\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121901490<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121901490\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121901490<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121901490\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121901490<\/a><br>BUT WHAT ABOUT WATTERS???","filename":"6ra0cPIS","ext":".jpg","w":512,"h":512,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492638401016,"time":1492638401,"md5":"82Ze+78M1+jxxoZPHFSW3A==","fsize":24875,"resto":121900435,"id":"hAzLIMjx","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121902264,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)17:48:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"what about that manley greg gutfled?","time":1492638526,"resto":121900435,"id":"uaeztEJW","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121902465,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)17:50:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121901972\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121901972<\/a><br>Watters is an unlikable twat with a forced persona and tired shtick who doesn&#039;t have the face, voice, or personality to carry his own prime time show. <br><br>Other than that, he&#039;s great.","time":1492638603,"resto":121900435,"id":"Ok20fGSP","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121902926,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)17:53:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"Shillue out.

You move closer to the wall, astonished that something is speaking to you. Once you responded back, confirming your existence, the voice tells you that he&#039;s been chained up and is being tortured on the other side of the wall. He says that, just like you, he was instructed to do whatever the intercom said, and was perfectly content. This was until he noticed a crack in the wall and viewed the outside world for the first time. He began to find inconsistencies in the intercom&#039;s claims, and stopped doing what the intercom told him to do. This made the intercom very angry, and although the truth was revealed to him about his place in the world, his life was infinitely worse off for knowing such. He tells you that, even though you now know that the room is not all that there is, you must continue to do what the intercom tells you to do, because if you don&#039;t you&#039;ll end up just like him.<br><br>So what do you do?

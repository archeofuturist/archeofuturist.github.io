All day long people will post the best snippets of their lives, every exciting thing that they do, every party, pretending like their lives are perfect, when in reality for every good moment you have, you have 20 equally mundane, depressing, or lonely moments. It&#039;s become a sort of one-upsmanship, who has the happiest life? Who can get the most likes on their photo? <br><br>Then you have the people that look at it and don&#039;t factor that into what their seeing, so all they can see is &quot;Wow, my life is so depressing, look at all these people having fun, what am I doing in my life?&quot; When in reality, everyone is most likely more or less on par with each other. I pulled the plug on all my social media accounts a while back and it was one of the best decisions I&#039;ve ever made. Believe it or not it&#039;s also a good convo starter for chicks, they find it intriguing, but unfortunately once they realize that they can&#039;t use you to tag in photos or become &quot;FB official,&quot; with, they beg you to make one.","time":1493869480,"resto":124011206,"id":"+zj8aczn","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124013781,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)23:48:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"Because it cuts off the need to interact with people while also satisfying the need for attention.","filename":"1467882462362","ext":".gif","w":400,"h":221,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":69,"tim":1493869706765,"time":1493869706,"md5":"kW1G48ZjTVfGwaRmnPNkGA==","fsize":466614,"resto":124011206,"id":"pQPlulaS","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124013872,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)23:49:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"Instant gratification","time":1493869751,"resto":124011206,"id":"+EwUHjsG","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124013992,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)23:50:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124011206\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124011206<\/a><br>I learned my lesson about going outside.","filename":"story of my life","ext":".png","w":1032,"h":347,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":42,"tim":1493869804935,"time":1493869804,"md5":"IlrcqEK+Pr6Bcwk2xIfvXA==","fsize":382820,"resto":124011206,"id":"6uZgCu7t","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

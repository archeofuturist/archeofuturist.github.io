Far from elevating someone in order to drop them, these idiot inheritors generally exclude all talent and hire their own. This is why so many Hollywood catastrophes are not only flops, but are very clearly flops to everyone but their makers. This is the third generation that cannot hold on to the family wealth. This is a decadent, cut-off elite that never hears any criticism.","time":1492735722,"resto":122059682,"id":"YxSkrBFX","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122071881,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)20:48:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122065381\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122065381<\/a><br>Why isn&#039;t Twitter dead?","time":1492735729,"resto":122059682,"id":"MwjpI1fy","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122072015,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)20:50:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"Damn, his twitter was great entertainment.","filename":"58% totally not rigged by pol","ext":".png","w":1366,"h":768,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1492735833531,"time":1492735833,"md5":"Coy7Nwc2pVhvy+TMA6UxMA==","fsize":1900982,"resto":122059682,"id":"y\/kbrv\/U","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":122072353,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)20:53:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122069229\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122069229<\/a><br>nah i&#039;m joe","time":1492736038,"resto":122059682,"id":"Eeauszsa","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122072594,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)20:56:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122068547\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122068547<\/a><br>Ow the edge","time":1492736174,"resto":122059682,"id":"zmvF6IRl","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122072751,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)20:57:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"Not the first time we&#039;ve been kicked while we&#039;re down...","filename":"umirinmygoobahs","ext":".jpg","w":1307,"h":824,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":78,"tim":1492736266628,"time":1492736266,"md5":"zdFNXUbv6q+DMNXwhnNq8A==","fsize":138967,"resto":122059682,"id":"Pq2C2qz+","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":122072993,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)21:00:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"What if this is has been his plan all along, to become a mass shooting meme, so that when he actually pulls off one everyone will be like &quot;kek nice meme&quot; and won&#039;t believe it.","filename":"1492574013086","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":1024,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492736412148,"time":1492736412,"md5":"\/T22d5wmh7UJiC4CQrPn5A==","fsize":224934,"resto":122059682,"id":"OAygtPpJ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122073193,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)21:02:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122065381\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122065381<\/a><br>Didn&#039;t say anything particularly provocative recently that I can recall.<br>At least they gave a reason when they banned Milo, and I don&#039;t really give a fuck about him either way, but Sammy did literally nothing wrong.","filename":"1491617122886","ext":".gif","w":202,"h":360,"tn_w":70,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492736523565,"time":1492736523,"md5":"Fqds7Q43sFuksmTK1e7eMQ==","fsize":1930165,"resto":122059682,"id":"ar18INvJ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122074115,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)21:10:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Twitter bans Sam Hyde and other genuine far right accounts<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;gives Richard Spencer a verified account and even unsuspends him the one time he gets banned<\/span><br>what did they mean by this?","filename":"C91K-H5XcAAs-Ls","ext":".jpg","w":901,"h":1200,"tn_w":93,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492737047945,"time":1492737047,"md5":"vEeIHj3YQDjCFdWFT\/Zaxg==","fsize":230708,"resto":122059682,"id":"aIJHhaw7","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":122074891,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)21:18:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122071881\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122071881<\/a><br>Does Twitter even make money?","time":1492737488,"resto":122059682,"id":"SXFHqqTX","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122076411,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)21:31:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122074115\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122074115<\/a><br>Sam is a troll.

The Mary Sue and other SJW mafia websites started attacking AS because they didn&#039;t have any talentless SJW cows working at the network. They bullies the Rick and Morty creators into adding women writers (derailing the show in the process) but Lazzo refused to hire SJW cows to make their own shows, siting that he would not be bullied to put unfunny women on the air for quota. <br><br>2. Adult Swim cut ties with Brad Gelman, who did a series of specials on the network that got shit ratings. After not being able to get Adult Swim to approve any additional sketches, he tried to exploit the SJW mafia attack on the network to get them to hire his talentless wife, with her re-pitching HIS REJECTED COMEDY SPECIALS, with the eye of getting them greenlighted via affirmative action. Lazzo told him to get loss, so he goes public before AS could announce they were severing ties, by claiming that he was &quot;quitting&quot; AS because of sexism and the hiring of Sam Hyde, who&#039;s hiring pissed him off even moreso given how he was now unemployed. <br><br>3. The Buzzfeed writer who joined up with Gelman to shit all over AS for giving Sam a show on Adult Swim<br><br>4. Eric Andre, who hated MDE for their politics and created such a shit storm that both Andre and MDE got hit with a gag order by AS to keep them from bad mouthing each other. <br><br>5. Tim Heidecker.

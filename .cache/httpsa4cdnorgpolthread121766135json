He lost his shit, started spitting and literally foaming at the mouth. He was screaming about Jews and Soros, blaming Obama, and literally ripping his own hair out while running in circles like a maniac. Everyone was so scared of him, they thought he was a terrorist.<br><br>Then he came at me, with this absolute insane look in his eyes. And I knew what I had to do. I had to protect all of those people. So I handily reversed his energy back on him and flipped him with minimal effort. The last thing you heard from him was a scream about Pizzagate before he went through a glass window and broke 14 vertebrate in his neck, due to how hard I had to flip him to safely clear the people around us.<br><br>When the police arrived, they all shook my hand to thank me for keeping everyone safe. They said people like him deserve to be locked up forever and have their guns taken away. I wholeheartedly agreed and offered to personally go take the guns out of his house. They thanked me again and gave me his house key. <br><br>After a cheer from the crowd, I ransacked his house for illegal weapons, turned over his child porn to the police, and confiscated all his Trump memorabilia for good measure in case they need it for hate crime charges.<br><br>All this man had to do was admit the dossier was real. Instead he&#039;s in the hospital with 24 broken vertebrate and 89 felony charges.","filename":"C8PfZSbXkAAEv-y","ext":".jpg","w":480,"h":310,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":161,"tim":1492560386465,"time":1492560386,"md5":"3\/iiZunvKXC6f4qJzEbawA==","fsize":35498,"resto":0,"id":"mt0te5HZ","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"why-are-conservatives-so-violent","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":121766836,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)20:11:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121766135\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121766135<\/a><br>This is what liberals fantasize about.","time":1492560688,"resto":121766135,"id":"TvJc38Vt","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]}

They recorded 361 cases compared to 410 in 2015, which had already been the lowest number in a decade. The figure reported Sunday is the lowest since 2003, when 360 incidents were recorded.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The report attributed much of the drop to increased security measures in European countries including France, where there were 15 attacks compared to 72 in the previous year, and the United Kingdom, where the number of incidents fell from 62 to 43.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Another reason for the decreased violence may be that far-right groups in Europe appear to be focusing their attacks on migrants who have reached the continent in large numbers over the last years, said Dina Porat, a historian who leads the team of researchers behind the report.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;Fears that the influx of Muslim refugees from the Middle East would lead to an increase in anti-Semitism appear so far to have been unjustified,&quot; Porat said.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;While Islamic extremists are often involved in attacks on Jews, the perpetrators are usually second or third generation immigrants who have been radicalized at home in Europe or during trips to territories held by the Islamic State group, she said.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Tel Aviv University&#039;s Center for the Study of Contemporary European Jewry releases the report every year on the eve of Israel&#039;s Holocaust memorial day, which begins Sunday at sundown.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;According to the report, the reduced violence was not mirrored by a drop in cases of general anti-Semitism, which increased in countries including the United Kingdom, Germany and the United States.<\/span><br><br>https:\/\/apnews.com\/24ad9181770a49e6<wbr>882f96b1f0805df5\/Report:-Anti-Semit<wbr>ism-rises,-but-violence-against-Jew<wbr>s-falls","filename":"800","ext":".jpg","w":800,"h":533,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1492980948188,"time":1492980948,"md5":"e4AcnOQdU8aVlXKBjGGAYA==","fsize":83466,"resto":0,"id":"Zt3d7NbF","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"report-antisemitism-rises-but-violence-against","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":1,"unique_ips":3},{"no":122486252,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)16:57:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;anti semetism on the rise in Germany<\/span><br><br>Is it happening?","filename":"IMG_3442","ext":".jpg","w":480,"h":360,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1492981076292,"time":1492981076,"md5":"Z5ja+EWG5b9DNeYeasDpAw==","fsize":24670,"resto":122485939,"id":"xLLdlZuf","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122486412,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)16:59:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122485939\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122485939<\/a><br>And I had this idea of a modern twist on the dab.<br><br>One hand roman salute, other hand performing a Hitlers mustache with two fingers in the dabbing motion.","time":1492981150,"resto":122485939,"id":"O7wBPNGI","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]}

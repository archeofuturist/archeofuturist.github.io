People are not born with funtamentalistic ideas, so we should start working against the causes that make people turn to fundamentalism, such as poverty and a poor educational system. We need to get rid of the politically correct idea that all cultures are equal from an objective standpoint, and start teaching the children why secularism is beneficial for all in society.","time":1491894276,"resto":120556391,"id":"w3OV70mD","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":120567757,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)03:06:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120567179\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120567179<\/a><br>Leaf this place.

Pulling yourself up by the bootstraps does not work. I know this from personal experience. I went to a middle school in the ghetto, where I lived. All the teachers were old, unmotivated and terrible at teaching. They didn&#039;t care for the students at all, and therefore we never got the help we needed to understand a specific subject or solve problems. The school was underfunded like crazy and education was severly lacking. The building was old and the ventilation system didn&#039;t even work properly. We didn&#039;t even have access to computers, even though our school system required us to have access to the internet for research and computers to write our essays. During or breaks we literally had nothing to do but stand around in the hallways of the school. The students noticed this and it lead to us being unmotivated when it came to education. By the end of middle school I thought going to school was terrible and unnecessary. However in high school I went to a school in a rich Swedish area. The teachers were motivated, amazing and really helpful. The school had plenty of things like computers and stuff to do during the breaks. I started actually wanting to go to school and becoming more and more interested in learning. By the end of high school I was completely set on academics. I went to a top university and got a masters in engineering. All thanks to the high school I went to. Now imagine if I had gone to a high school in the ghetto that was similar to the middle school I went to. I know for sure that I wouldn&#039;t had gone to a university afterward. I would&#039;ve most likely gotten a low wage job or became a criminal.","time":1491895725,"resto":120556391,"id":"w3OV70mD","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"}]}

Only advice I really can give is that there needs to be real boundaries in the relationship for anything to work. When this girl would go into an episode, which could start from literally any stimuli, she would become extremely unreasonable to the point where I needed to leave the scene in order to cool down and continue hanging out. She became belligerent too many times and I ultimately ended the relationship. I had become her therapeutic crutch and when we tried to become &quot;friends&quot; a month after the breakup she very clearly had an agenda to restart the relationship. I had to eventually move out of State to separate myself and gain independence back, but I still deal with near harassment on the phone. Loved the girl, too.<br><br>My answer to the OP is to think carefully about the type of bond you start with this woman. A familial type bond early in the relationship could be devastating because you&#039;re making her problems your problems. A friendship type bond is the only that can possibly work with depression.","time":1492237716,"resto":121179703,"id":"Uo+dtuan","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121180676,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)02:33:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121179703\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121179703<\/a><br>All women are insane.

Now when I say &quot;severe depression&quot; I don&#039;t mean your average bullshit that every teenager has, but legit depression; just motivating her to do anything was a nightmare for the longest time. Over the years though she improved. I got her going out more, she stopped hitting herself as much, stopped breaking things, etc. As she got better I started to ponder on popping the question to her. I had my proposal ready, was ready to buy the ring, ready to tell her how proud I was of her and all her progress, and then I discovered that she had cheated on me with another guy one evening. She claimed that at the time she was just feeling lonely and her depression had come back to haunt her that day, but I wouldn&#039;t accept any excuse for it.<br><br>I left her and just three days later I got news from her brother that she had hung herself. It&#039;s been two years now, I still love her, and I still ponder on if I should have just forgiven her for what she had done. Her family no longer talks to me and claims that I am the reason why their daughter killed herself.<br><br>So my advice? I say stay away. Women with mental health issues are just random-cannons.

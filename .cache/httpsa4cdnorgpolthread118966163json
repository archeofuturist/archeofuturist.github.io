Their entire lives revolve around the acquisition of status which is provided in the form of ego-stroking achieved through &quot;attention&quot;. Women know they eventually age and become hag faced witches, and thus, they must exploit their sexuality as soon as it becomes viable. in many societies there is also cultural pressure compelling them to sexualize and socialize for fame and attention at an early age. Needless to say, the results of this is their invariable obsession with celebrity, status, and the tangible power related to those concepts. This is why women often appear to men as merely vacant consuming sociopaths totally obsessed with superficial nonsense who use and discard good men without a thought: men are only pieces in the women&#039;s status game, which they are playing against each other. In that game, achieving envy amongst other women is the ultimate goal, and all of the female&#039;s actions are motivated by that ultimate desire.","time":1490907399,"resto":118966163,"id":"DX\/h0g\/N","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118967720,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)16:58:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118967462\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118967462<\/a><br>this","time":1490907517,"resto":118966163,"id":"D343z3S5","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":118968488,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)17:04:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118966383\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118966383<\/a><br>(You)","time":1490907878,"resto":118966163,"id":"YoBYBh\/A","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118968753,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)17:06:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118967462\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118967462<\/a><br>based","filename":"1472081397051","ext":".jpg","w":960,"h":720,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1490908007777,"time":1490908007,"md5":"4uw5a\/CxMRVw\/biiESqcWA==","fsize":86200,"resto":118966163,"id":"kRio+YK6","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":118968844,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)17:07:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118966163\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118966163<\/a><br>During hunter-gatherer times men proved themselves by becoming good hunters and collaborating with other men to hunt big game. This is why men make good soldiers and tend to have better teamwork skills. Women, on the other hand, all gathered food and took care of children. The best way for women to move up in standing was to acquire the best hunters as mates and to do that they had to stand out. This also meant they had to make other women look worse than them. This is the key difference. For all men, a fellow man improving meant hunting was safer, this was the primordial brotherhood. For all women, all other women were competition in acquiring the best mates.<br><br>You have to remember that civilization and the traditions traditionalists adhere to, even the biblical ones, were all innovations in their own right. These traditions served us for thousands of years, but they were still novel ideas when they first came about.","time":1490908051,"resto":118966163,"id":"rhbi43MU","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118969675,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)17:14:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118968844\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118968844<\/a><br>But how is this passed down to modern day women?

It&#039;s a no brainer to me that people making 10 million and above should be paying more than people making 5 million, and way more than people making 1 million.

The system definitely has it&#039;s shortcomings, like the lumping people in that make 500k or more in as the same who make 10 mil. That said, the tax plan doesn&#039;t happen in a vacuum. Hopefully it&#039;s happening in tandem with an overhaul of other things that make staying attractive.

I had to take a quiz in BIO (got an A) and write a research paper in GOVT. I had a homemade hamburger for lunch and some chicken with vegetables and a sweet potato for diner. I may also be getting my old job back, so that&#039;s exciting. I have just 3 more weeks of school left for this semester and after that is Summer, which will hopefully be filled with job-related work and Injustice 2. Unfortunately, I may end up moving to a city I am not very fond of after the Summer, but I don&#039;t know yet.","filename":"Day 2","ext":".jpg","w":540,"h":497,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":230,"tim":1493094206206,"time":1493094206,"md5":"jOVQ1dr3UF6TGjkNi9HO5g==","fsize":49412,"resto":0,"id":"T6HKCUh9","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"conservative-texanon-updateprogress-thread-day-2","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

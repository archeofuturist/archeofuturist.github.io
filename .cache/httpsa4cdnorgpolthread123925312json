Why such a thing does not already exist baffles and astonishes me. Also, procedures for states to leave the Union. You think we would have figured that out after the Civil War. Perhaps there could be an amendment addressing Gerrymandering as well.

We have learned through the election of Donald Trump that anything is possible in the current political climate. Why not do the unexpected, stand up on our hind legs, and start acting like the genius bipedal hairless apes we are?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;TOO EASY<\/span><br><br>So sure, we could get a horrifying Totalitarian technocracy out of this deal too, but maybe not!

Mark R.

What I am more curious about is why this isn&#039;t the obvious best choice given the times we find ourselves in.

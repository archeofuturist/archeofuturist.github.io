However, all these once-communist countries are, right now, the countries that are the most homogeous in regards to society. Some countries even have parties at power that are trying to keep it that way, but this is obviously difficult due to open-border policy. <br><br>My question however is, what do you guys\/girls think the connection is between old-soviet countries and their still homogeneous society. Has it to do with communistic mentality, not been infected with SJW crap - if so, why? - , or is it the fact that Christianity is still very much alive which unites people against the common enemy. Aka useless arabs.","filename":"Homogenuous-1","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":960,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1493635172698,"time":1493635172,"md5":"DKLRLEXIUERACyuROms4LA==","fsize":414236,"resto":0,"id":"\/rkjcMSR","country":"NL","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"connection-between-old-soviet-countries-and-their","country_name":"Netherlands","replies":7,"images":0,"unique_ips":6},{"no":123606373,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)06:49:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123605600\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123605600<\/a><br>communism helped because it was so bad.

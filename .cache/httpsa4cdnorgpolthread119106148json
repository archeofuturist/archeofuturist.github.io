I kinda get the argument about sovereignty: You don&#039;t want Brussel to tell you what to do. But you have to remind yourself that your own government is much more powerful than the EU. I know that the EU is often-times seen as a council of power-hungry jews trying to ride the whole continent into submission.

And the UK has their members there, as well.<br><br>I definitely don&#039;t get the worry that the EU forces the laws of immigration onto a country. The issues of immigration are up to the country itself and is not the fault of the EU. Let me give you two examples: A bad example would be Germany, getting in all those muzzies. A good example would be Hungary, who by themselves decided that they won&#039;t put up with any muzzie-shit and simply locked down their borders.<br>And I especially don&#039;t get the whole debate about the UK being worried about immigration since a) they already let so many shitskins in; and b) because they are a fucking island. You have a god-darn moat around you. How difficult can it be to defend that? You don&#039;t need to have any patrols on the borders. Just set up a law refusing immigrants and get all those darn boats back to France when they try to cross the channel.","time":1491002201,"resto":119106148,"id":"JrbFDJIL","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":119113519,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)19:16:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119113490\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119113490<\/a><br>So, okay, you&#039;ve finally left the EU. But what are the results from that?<br><br>Sovereignty: Yeah, you don&#039;t have to listen to the rules imposed by the evil EU. But now, you have to dance to the tune of the EU. What leverage does the UK have over whole of the EU? Especially since the UK hasn&#039;t been a strong economical powerhouse recently and the Brexit is not making it any better. Imagine the biggest sanction ever between the UK and the EU: No trade whatsoever between the isles and the continent. Who do you think will bleed more from it? Sure, some EU companies might face a big loss, some may even go bankrupt. But what about the UK? While the EU lost one trade partner, the UK lost 27 potential trade partners.<br><br>Immigration: Even before ever talking about leaving the EU, you already had a massive problem with immigration. And I&#039;m sure as hell not talking about Polish guys working in the industry of plumbing (God bless them). The Pakis weren&#039;t a recent issue caused by the EU, were they? The recent issues are not a problem of the EU, but of the countries itself. Germany has an issue with it because the politics (Best example: Mutti Merkel) caused it. The USA are discussing immigration problems as well, and they&#039;ve never even been part of the EU.<br><br>In conclusion: The EU is of course a darn bureaucratic monster and therefore quite inefficient. It needs reforms and it needs to - just as the US government - be kept as small as possible while it needs to be kept as big as needed. But the illusion that leaving the EU will make all of Britain&#039;s problems go away is just ridiculous. And leaving the EU will strip the UK of any power to change the EU - leaving the isles helpless for anything the EU might ever decide to do against the UK.","time":1491002219,"resto":119106148,"id":"JrbFDJIL","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":119113607,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)19:17:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119106628\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119106628<\/a><br>No. How about you, Achmed?

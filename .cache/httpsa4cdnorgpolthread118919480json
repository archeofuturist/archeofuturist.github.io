That&#039;s one time discount. <br><br>Or if it&#039;s verizon and you&#039;re renewing then ask then if they can add free premium channels.

India in it&#039;s history had been a relatively peaceful country. These countries will have to learn that progress is only with co operation.<br><br>Buddhists are bro tier, they&#039;re essentially offshoot of Hinduism. We do have no problems with them. <br><br>Look up how we annexed Hyderabad and Sikkim. India in it&#039;s early days made some daring moves. So much that Sikkim had monarchy and their Parliament passed a motion to join us. <br><br>We should not annex (that is assuming we could without mucu international outcry) so much Muslim population in India already. We don&#039;t want more.<br><br>People think India&#039;s problem is outside , realistically it&#039;s only China that we worry about. <br>Pakistan is a destabilized country. Nepal and India are bros, Myanmar is killing muzzies so bro already. <br><br>We helped Bangladesh to attain Freedom quickly so they should be friendly but the wahabi extremism being exported from Saudi Arabia HSS turned that country into extremist shithole. We&#039;ll work together with them and be better. <br><br>We are great with Afghanistan too (it would seem like we do not share a border but we do, it is in pak occupied Kashmir, the Durant line.)<br><br>Sri Lanka and India have good relations. We did have problems but overall we are mending them. Indian intelligence agence RAW ( research and analysis wing) works pretty deep in SL. <br><br>We need to keep them on out side due to the port of Colombo has a possibility of being used as port for Chinese ships. <br><br>India doesn&#039;t want that under any circumstance. It is no surprise the leader who supported Chinese government lost (had to) election there . <br><br>We do not consider Pakistan a legitimate threat.

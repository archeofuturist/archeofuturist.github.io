Rousseau himself admitted the state of nature was (as was common among philosphers of the time) a thought experiment. He himself said that it could never again happen, and perhaps never happened in the first place.<br>2. His idea of the state of nature makes perfect sense when you read it in context, ie. as a reaction to Hobbes. Hobbes asserted that in the absence of a punitive state, humans will always harm other humans (basically kill eachother for shits and giggles). Rousseau instead assumed [somewhat in line with modern criminology] that humans mostly harm other humans if there is some benefit to be had. This requires the pre-existence of property. In other words Hobbes doesn&#039;t neccessarily disagree with Hobbes that humans will do evil unto eachother, but he disagreed that most humans would harm others if there&#039;s no benefit to be had. <br>3. Rousseau never asserted that this was somehow &quot;separate&quot; from human nature. He was far from a primitivist (we get this idea from Voltaire, who loved to slander Rousseau to the point of accusing him of arson when he was clearly innocent). This is why his solution to the problems of modernity wasn&#039;t to abandon it all, but to create a system that draws sovereignity from the people and respects personal liberty (as natural liberty had been abandoned and could not be reclaimed).<br>4. This is the big kicker. Marx never cited Rousseau. Some of the 1830s utopian thinkers cited Rousseau, the Anarchist [which is basically the opposite of totalitarian Marxism] Proudhon even had a more extremist version of Rousseau&#039;s view (property is theft), but never Marx. <br>cont.","time":1490143792,"resto":117681656,"id":"lyy7AhWk","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":117695949,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)20:50:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117695919\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117695919<\/a><br><br><br>5.

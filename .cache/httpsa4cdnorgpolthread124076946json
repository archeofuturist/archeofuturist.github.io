Here are the replies to that comment:<br>&quot;Why don&#039;t you tell us how you REALLY feel you drumphtard fuckwit&quot; or &quot;I bet you also believe in chemtrails too dont your?&quot; And it just got even more strange from there, it&#039;s like I was being baited. I didn&#039;t reply but after 3 days the comment was deleted. Why? They left all sorts of swearing and derogatory comments up, but a comment condoning violent extremism needs deletion? The amount of shilling and censorship in that comment section is not only bizarre, but it&#039;s fucking comical.","time":1493918505,"resto":124076946,"id":"MhF7HAQr","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":124083300,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)13:26:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"Never be mad, you never had a choice and you were really useful, good goys.","filename":"1493824265407","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":720,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1493918773082,"time":1493918773,"md5":"fyFEcVzc1nvpRReqWjPQcw==","fsize":105501,"resto":124076946,"id":"+1BTYArU","country":"MX","m_img":1,"country_name":"Mexico"},{"no":124083333,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)13:26:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124080632\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124080632<\/a><br>Protip: to \/pol\/ beltway liberalism IS leftism, weirdly enough \/pol\/&#039;s been discovering leftist critiques of capitalism and incorporating them against social liberalism.<br><br>Someday \/pol\/&#039;s gonna discover No Logo and American politics will do a 180.","time":1493918789,"resto":124076946,"id":"SsyfNnik","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124083492,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)13:27:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124077468\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124077468<\/a><br>YOU THOUGHT YOU HAD A CHOICE BUT WE CONTROL BOTH SIDES BURGER","filename":"maxresdefault","ext":".jpg","w":1440,"h":1080,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1493918866905,"time":1493918866,"md5":"v8F7IehABYbja18NnKqrdg==","fsize":105423,"resto":124076946,"id":"hzb9SFaN","country":"AU","m_img":1,"country_name":"Australia"},{"no":124083532,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)13:28:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124082754\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124082754<\/a><br>Daily Dose: <br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/detM0cKxWro<br><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/oBSvUlkB61s","filename":"1493508738983","ext":".jpg","w":409,"h":409,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493918888375,"time":1493918888,"md5":"ng0wyyoGuWXZNPzIDkvFAQ==","fsize":110551,"resto":124076946,"id":"hnFwPfQc","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124083640,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)13:28:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124076946\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124076946<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Wapo now sides with the 1% <\/span><br>lmaoing at socialists","time":1493918936,"resto":124076946,"id":"oCL3WtM0","country":"MC","country_name":"Monaco"},{"no":124083772,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)13:29:57","name":"Anonymous","filename":"10235908","ext":".png","w":800,"h":919,"tn_w":108,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493918997080,"time":1493918997,"md5":"S5+CTwuWf3uBGC6zuK4YiA==","fsize":1834913,"resto":124076946,"id":"VvHByoUV","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":124083797,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)13:30:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124083492\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124083492<\/a><br>What are we even supposed to do?<br>IT&#039;S A TWO PARTY SYSTEM!","time":1493919010,"resto":124076946,"id":"7rCKDvoY","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124083832,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)13:30:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124080083\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124080083<\/a><br>Going &quot;wealthy elites dictating policy is good actually&quot; is the sort of attention-grabbing contrarianism that every writing class middle school onward will tell you to do.

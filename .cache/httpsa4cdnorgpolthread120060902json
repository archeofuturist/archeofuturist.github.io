Although the current regime in power &quot;pretends to be a secularist&quot;<br><br>Syria and russia are best of friends. Russia has a presence in syria. Russian leader putin and syrian leader assad are butt buddies.<br><br>\/Pol\/ is FILLED to the rim with russian shills who push propaganda, and yes. They shilled hard for Donald. Its somwhat true what the media is saying because let me assure you, \/pol\/ is being slid by russian shills bashing trump for his actions.<br><br>Have you ever seen an entire board do a 180 on \/thereguy\/ so quickly? No. Its never happened. The &quot;outrage&quot; is entirely manufactured.<br><br>A few years back, barack obama took a hard stance on syria. We knew they had a stockpile of chemical weapon. The use of chemical warfare is a war crime. Obama threatened syrian government used used said chemical weapons in its civil war, the united states would step in and attack. <br><br>This was known as the &quot;red line&quot; everyone talks about. Obama drew the line in the sand.. and then assad, the syrian president, said &quot;lol watch me&quot;. He conducted a large scale chemical bombing, killing over 1,400 people. Many of which were innocent civilians. Childrend. Women. Etc. He used a toxic nerve gas that killed them slowly and painfully.<br><br>So assad crosses the line and obama chickens out and says &quot;lol jk&quot; and syria made an agreement to disarm their chemical weapons and never use again because of the outrage of the entire world.<br><br>And flash foward to april 4 2017. <br>Assad again conducts a chemical attack in a town where opposition in the civil war had completely taken over. <br><br>Those dying for the toxic poison were taken to a nearby hospital and putin\/assad order the hilospital to be bombed.

No deaths. Only target was the base.<br><br>Shills now are mad at trump because he intervened.<br>This is hardly an intervention. We xould at any second bomb the living fuck out of assad and get him out if we wanted to.<br><br>No. The united states is like a grown up watching two babies fight. 1 of the babies picked up a knife and the usa steooed in and took the knife away.

Ever heard of freedom of speech? Now they&#039;re going around and making channels &quot;restricted&quot; which basically kills the momentum of videos and the channel as well. Not to mention the constant anti-Trump videos showing up on trending even if the view count is under 10k.<br><br>YouTube needs to stop pushing a liberal agenda, but they are fucking up on several other issues. Advertising guidelines, copyright ID, flagging, YouTube heroes, just to name a few. <br><br>Seriously. We need to start an uprising with hackers or something. If nothing changes, it&#039;ll only get worse.","filename":"maxresdefault (4)","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":720,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1490405564195,"time":1490405564,"md5":"MMC7mVekL3ILBld+dwd3+Q==","fsize":35013,"resto":0,"id":"DwAsrA\/9","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"fuck-youtube","country_name":"United States","replies":15,"images":1,"unique_ips":10},{"no":118167359,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)21:44:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118165868\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118165868<\/a><br>enjoy your botnet","time":1490406260,"resto":118165868,"id":"cYWYR5lG","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118167502,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)21:45:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"why didn&#039;t you listen?","time":1490406331,"resto":118165868,"id":"cYWYR5lG","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118167611,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)21:46:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"herd the nigger cattle","time":1490406385,"resto":118165868,"id":"cYWYR5lG","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118167821,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)21:48:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118165868\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118165868<\/a><br>Lets develop in the blockchain of Etherium dapps to combat censorship!","time":1490406502,"resto":118165868,"id":"22wsH3e0","country":"PR","country_name":"Puerto Rico"},{"no":118167970,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)21:49:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"docile people shit all day","time":1490406577,"resto":118165868,"id":"cYWYR5lG","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118168186,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)21:51:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118167821\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118167821<\/a><br>I have considered this. <br>I may look into working on it.","time":1490406675,"resto":118165868,"id":"iwmsm1xu","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118168450,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)21:53:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"youtube.com\/watch?v=9sJUDx7iEJw","time":1490406807,"resto":118165868,"id":"cYWYR5lG","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118168645,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)21:54:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"No, but larger political youtubers need to form a syndicate of sorts- an alliance.

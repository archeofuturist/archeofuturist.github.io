I just said I wanted to know more, but he got more angry because he thought I was lying. Years later I realised he thought I was masturbating to it as if it were porn, but at the time I hadn&#039;t even made the connection between the two. Since then I&#039;ve always felt guilty when seeing nudity of any kind, and I&#039;ve never used porn to masturbate<br><br>A friend asked me what my sexuality was recently and I told him I didn&#039;t know - the reason for this being I can&#039;t think of a time where I&#039;ve ever been aroused as a result of someone&#039;s appearance, or had any conscious desire for sex with someone. He suggested I could be asexual, but I&#039;m not willing to commit to the label because I&#039;m not convinced it&#039;s a real thing and I feel like my upbringing could have caused genuine repression. I&#039;m 22 now and have no conscious desire to be in a romantic relationship, just having close friends is enough. Lacking any conscious sexual desire bothers and confuses me, but I don&#039;t know of any way to try and sort it out without exploring lust which I don&#039;t really see as an option","time":1492568967,"resto":121766039,"id":"3e6NAMOO","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":121786579,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)22:29:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121784879\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121784879<\/a><br>Not quite sure of denomination.

From Christ, to His mother, to the early saints and maryrts to ascetics up until today, He loves individuals who are put through pain, because it forces them to confront the truth of Him. Not as a tyrant that dispenses pain arbitrary, or judgmentally, but rather as the ultimate source of good, and the only source of joy that will remain when the world is dispelled. So often those in pain are the ones made aware of this truth early, that their can be no lasting joy without God.","time":1492579310,"resto":121766039,"id":"MF+VII+r","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121807292,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)01:23:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"Would you consider Jesus white?","filename":"veronicas-veil-ray-downing","ext":".jpg","w":698,"h":900,"tn_w":96,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492579396442,"time":1492579396,"md5":"+1hqUHJxAymb0sN0wLGQ9A==","fsize":192600,"resto":121766039,"id":"3swMA5P8","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121807491,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)01:25:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121806393\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121806393<\/a><br>Try if you can.

The one I like to point to is the incorruptibility of saint Bernadette, since the actual preservation (which keep in mind, is not the result of special treatment or the right conditions. Her wooden cross rotted in the coffin) has been verified by a medical Doctor, who wrote of it this:<br>&quot;I would have liked to open the left side of the thorax to take the ribs as relics and then remove the heart which I am certain must have survived. However, as the trunk was slightly supported on the left arm, it would have been rather difficult to try and get at the heart without doing too much noticeable damage. As the Mother Superior had expressed a desire for the Saint&#039;s heart to be kept together with the whole body, and as Monsignor the Bishop did not insist, I gave up the idea of opening the left-hand side of the thorax and contented myself with removing the two right ribs which were more accessible. ... What struck me during this examination, of course, was the state of perfect preservation of the skeleton, the fibrous tissues of the muscles (still supple and firm), of the ligaments, and of the skin, and above all the totally unexpected state of the liver after 46 years. One would have thought that this organ, which is basically soft and inclined to crumble, would have decomposed very rapidly or would have hardened to a chalky consistency. Yet, when it was cut it was soft and almost normal in consistency. I pointed this out to those present, remarking that this did not seem to be a natural phenomenon.&quot;<br>Pic related is her now, though she has a wax mask on due to some damage from the world wars IIRC. <br>Either way, a liver in near perfect condition after nearly 50 years is unheard of, esspecialy with no form of preservation.","filename":"image","ext":".jpg","w":293,"h":176,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":75,"tim":1492580723231,"time":1492580723,"md5":"L70PQFY17gAKreYT1fOnWA==","fsize":27537,"resto":121766039,"id":"+9sqlPC+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121810896,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)01:58:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121809490\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121809490<\/a><br>Have there been any other more recent, investigated miracles?

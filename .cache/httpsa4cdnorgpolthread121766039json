I just said I wanted to know more, but he got more angry because he thought I was lying. Years later I realised he thought I was masturbating to it as if it were porn, but at the time I hadn&#039;t even made the connection between the two. Since then I&#039;ve always felt guilty when seeing nudity of any kind, and I&#039;ve never used porn to masturbate<br><br>A friend asked me what my sexuality was recently and I told him I didn&#039;t know - the reason for this being I can&#039;t think of a time where I&#039;ve ever been aroused as a result of someone&#039;s appearance, or had any conscious desire for sex with someone. He suggested I could be asexual, but I&#039;m not willing to commit to the label because I&#039;m not convinced it&#039;s a real thing and I feel like my upbringing could have caused genuine repression. I&#039;m 22 now and have no conscious desire to be in a romantic relationship, just having close friends is enough. Lacking any conscious sexual desire bothers and confuses me, but I don&#039;t know of any way to try and sort it out without exploring lust which I don&#039;t really see as an option","time":1492568967,"resto":121766039,"id":"3e6NAMOO","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":121786579,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)22:29:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121784879\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121784879<\/a><br>Not quite sure of denomination.

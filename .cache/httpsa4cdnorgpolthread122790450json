The tone of the film is set almost right away, with heavy handed editorializing that supposedly links gun owners\/enthusiasts to far-right christian identity movements, and violent white supremacists. <br><br>Was this done on purpose to turn the table on the average U.S. citizen who groups moderate Muslim immigrants in with the so-called &quot;few&quot; jihadists, and radical Muslim&#039;s, that have indeed committed acts of terrorism on U.S. territory? If that was the directors intent, then how does that narrative account for the fact that acts of terrorism are being committed all over Europe, not by homegrown domestic terrorists, but by jihadists? <br><br>There is irony, too, in video of President W. Clinton announcing (to much applause I might add) the signing of a federal bill that banned the sale, and ownership, of &quot;assault rifles&quot; (defined through arbitrary means by the US GOVT). However this footage just happened to be preceded by video of ATF and FBI agents storming Mt. Carmel in Waco TX with guns blazing. Not only that, but the &quot;documentary&quot; conveniently excluded many of the controversies that followed the destruction of Mt. Carmel. There seemed to be very little accountability directed towards the ATF and FBI in this &quot;objective&quot; documentary, while most of the blame is shifted onto &quot;far-right christian identity movements&quot; and &quot;white supremacists&quot;. <br><br>I have not yet cancelled my Netflix subscription, but this is the proverbial straw that may have broke the camels back.","filename":"fair and unbiased (((documentary)))","ext":".jpg","w":1001,"h":434,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":108,"tim":1493155780834,"time":1493155780,"md5":"tAD3OOPFASjxDMheScGXUA==","fsize":97071,"resto":0,"id":"FMCfa7Ss","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"liberal-media-propaganda-general-lmpg","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

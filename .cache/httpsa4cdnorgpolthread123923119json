People would obviously call him crazy for building a boat without water, but when he saved his livelihood, of course they would tell stories about him, and stories always get exaggerated. Judaism adopted the story as a lesson on trusting god, and the story was expanded to be a worldwide flood (because how big did they think the world was back then?) and Noah saved every animal that exists. In reality, this is literally impossible, knowing the results of generational inbreeding that must have taken place for Noah to be a common ancestor.

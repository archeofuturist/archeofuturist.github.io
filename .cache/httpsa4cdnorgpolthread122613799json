Now try to imagine that same shithead dedicating his future to an idle life of homelessness, hard drugs and the occasional temper tantrum informed by the latest lyrical screeds from his favorite bands. When he isn&#039;t beating his bongo drums or strumming his out of tune acoustic at the latest protest, he&#039;s shooting smack, panhandling, accosting some poor sucker who committed the unspeakable atrocity of eating meat in his presence or ganging up with his buddies on another poor sucker who happened to say something that could be considered racist.<br><br>There really isn&#039;t a worse than this. Even the most loutish, knuckle-dragging skinhead looks dignified in comparison.<br><br>That said, I don&#039;t mind some of their music.

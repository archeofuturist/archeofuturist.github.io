If you don\u2019t agree with this one, you can take it down. P.S. there are only 2 (two) genders.<br><br>\u201cWe\u2019re not na\u00efve. We realize when we put up the first flag, someone might decide they want to remove it,\u201d Betsy Friauf, who donated the flag, told KDAF.<br><br>The pastor told KXAS they had planned to replace that rainbow flag this week.<br><br>Reverend Patrick Price told the station he would hope the thief would \u201ccome and talk to us \u2014 have a conversation.\u201d<br><br>Price said that church members filed a police report but \u201cthis is not something to be upset about.

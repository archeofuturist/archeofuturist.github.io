I&#039;m fairly sure the first time it arrive people actually felt the need to believe it but now it is probably just shills shilling shills<br><br>3) Topic Dilution: on \/pol\/ in general (doubles as sliding): in general, wild gooze chases, on \/trumpgen\/, gossip, pitting groups against each other.<br><br>4) Information collection: seen only rarely in here, &quot;let&#039;s make a lions guard for Trump \/ lets make ANTICOM&quot; and &quot;what would you do if Trump is impeached \/ is killed&quot;. Also &quot;let&#039;s access this site \/ app \/ plugin for more info&quot;. Don&#039;t fall for it folks.<br><br>5) Anger Trolling: our bread and butter, just see any post with a Finland flag beside it. Actually, it is our main weapon too so it is all fair games in this matter. Just don&#039;t answer the trolls.<br><br>6) Happened on many boards on 4chan when the happening and GG broke out. I don&#039;t know about \/pol\/ but \/v\/ and \/sp\/, for instance, that&#039;s a given. We are not very susceptible, being an anonymous chan anyway but on reddit, oh boy, I wouldn&#039;t touch that mess with a 100 feet pole covered in insulant and fire retardant. Social media in general, ever worse.

Just look at this photo of the Mar-a-Lago situation room during a briefing on the Syria missile strike.<br><br>Here we have Deputy Chief of Staff Joe Hagin, son-in-law Jared Kushner, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, national security adviser H.R. McMaster and Chief of Staff Reince Priebus. In the back we have Spicer, chief strategist Bannon, senior adviser Stephen Miller, national security aide Michael Anton, deputy national security adviser Dina Powell and National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn.<br><br>You have five people dedicated to domestic issues, plus Trump&#039;s son in law. The only people with experience in foreign affairs are McMaster and two national security people. And no, Bannon dicking around in the Navy 30 years ago does not make him a military expert.<br><br>During critical foreign policy missions, Trump surrounds himself with members of his inner circle, regardless of expertise.","filename":"download-1","ext":".jpg","w":1484,"h":988,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1491649248643,"time":1491649248,"md5":"mkFGKmfXipymEfsAux\/xQw==","fsize":260567,"resto":0,"id":"71uskDWe","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"objectively-speaking-trumps-foreign-policy-is","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

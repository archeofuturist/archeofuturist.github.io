You guys are the best people I know when it comes to pulling off some funny politic pranks and I&#039;d like to present one to you for consideration.<br><br>#nomoremoney<br><br>So this is the gist of the idea. With the hashtag above, as well as some other simple tricks, we spread the notion that the banks have no currency in their vaults, causing people to withdraw all of their cash from the banks. I know people have been floating the idea around here for a while, so it&#039;ll be easy! Many people don&#039;t trust banks anyways, so to convince them to withdraw all of their money will be a cakewalk. Here&#039;s the beauty of it, since it&#039;s Sunday, the banks won&#039;t be open and we can cause maximum awareness before Monday. This not only causes problems for the banks, it causes problems for (((them))) as well. Plus, if they try to acknowledge it or down play it later on, more people will become aware and question the authority\/legitimacy of the banks. It&#039;s a win-win!<br><br>What are your guys thoughts and ideas?","filename":"No more money","ext":".jpg","w":2029,"h":2068,"tn_w":245,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491185326571,"time":1491185326,"md5":"Dih46XLQz0TAIlHEs1N0EQ==","fsize":155022,"resto":0,"id":"U5pwRvJP","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"hey-pol-you-guys-are-the-best-people-i-know-when","country_name":"United States","replies":9,"images":8,"unique_ips":2},{"no":119277634,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)22:10:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119277501\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119277501<\/a><br>Here&#039;s something else. Since money is planet wide, this just won&#039;t affect american banks, we can take it world wide! Could you imagine waking up and finding people standing outside the bank of london asking for all of their life savings? Or people outside the german, japanese, french, australian, or spanish banks asking to close their accounts? Incredible! Plus, this would allow people to see how much they actually have, hopefully forcing them to make better future alternative choices with what they have.","filename":"no more pounds","ext":".png","w":450,"h":436,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":121,"tim":1491185400138,"time":1491185400,"md5":"S6\/t+UEUYEJFVqBzrleY0Q==","fsize":87759,"resto":119277501,"id":"U5pwRvJP","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119277775,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)22:11:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119277634\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119277634<\/a><br>We don&#039;t even need to make everyone do it, just enough to rattle people&#039;s cages and really be more conscious of the fact that this could be an actual possibility.

This time, it won&#039;t be the people suffering at the hands of some greedy bankers trying to swindle them out of the power of making currency, it&#039;ll be the other way around.","filename":"no more euros","ext":".png","w":425,"h":425,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491185495646,"time":1491185495,"md5":"aUhwMQOMDBw2iyYbL2rwhw==","fsize":33778,"resto":119277501,"id":"U5pwRvJP","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119277898,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)22:12:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119277775\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119277775<\/a><br>Just spread it by word of mouth that the banks are having problems and the rest takes care of itself. We don&#039;t even have to lie about this top point. Just point to the recent Wells Fargo scandal and tell them they can&#039;t be trusted with our account information, let alone our money. And man, we could just keep piling it on about fees and how interest doesn&#039;t even help us anymore. <br>We could also post pictures of our cash and withdrawal slips.

The inhabitants of that community are farmers, tradesmen, and country gentry, all of whom indulge in the innocent pleasures of rustic life: good food, strong beer, and idle gossip, all amply represented at Bilbo&#039;s birthday party. This ideal image stays with the hobbits as they travel through strange and frightening distant lands.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;When they return home, however, the Shire hobbits discover their cherished ideal corrupted. A totalitarian state has replaced the carefree rural life, dominated by &quot;the Rules&quot; and suffering from &quot;no beer and very little food.&quot; Journeying deeper into the Shire reveals a devastated countryside. Homes have been replaced by ugly row houses and barracks, trees have been wantonly felled, and the old mill has been replaced by &quot;a great brick building straddling the stream, which it fouled with a steaming and stinking outflow.&quot; <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mordor has come home; everything the hobbits have fought so hard for has been ruined. At first glance, Frodo and the others blame outside forces for the destruction. Evil men, brigands, and thieves have moved in while the protecting Rangers have gone to war. Sharkey, their leader, has urged them to &quot;hack, burn and ruin&quot; since his arrival. The hobbits soon learn that Sharkey is their old enemy Saruman, who has ravaged the Shire in revenge for his own losses.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The outsiders are not the only ones to blame, however. Like the evil of the Ring, the evil that besets the Shire works from within, feeding on the hobbits&#039; own desires. Lotho Sackville-Baggins, hungry for power and prestige, brought the first Men into the Four Farthings to protect his growing property. &quot;Seems he wanted to own everything himself, and then order other folk about,&quot; says Farmer Cotton.<\/span>","filename":"Orcs_are_good","ext":".jpg","w":490,"h":347,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":88,"tim":1491815396402,"time":1491815396,"md5":"0H+8\/CxSTxkcz8rjzlLcAg==","fsize":81550,"resto":120394481,"id":"jT4fQp61","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120416933,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)05:11:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120416839\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120416839<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Other hobbits also accepted and even enjoyed the changes, regardless of the cost. Ted Sandyman, the greedy miller, loves the wasteful and polluting mechanisms of the new mill, &quot;and he works there cleaning wheels for the Men, where his dad was the Miller and his own master.&quot; Worst of all, the hobbits have allowed this to happen; whether through inattention or cowardice, the most sensible and good hobbits went along with the changes until, &quot;before we knew where we were,&quot; the beauty and joy of the Shire were gone.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The return of Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin catalyzes the hobbits. The adventurers have grown on their journey, and they know the importance of defending their ideals against evil. They have fought and won the impossible battle against Sauron; a struggle against a real but abstract evil. Now they must fight evil again, this time at the very concrete level of their own homeland.

Thank Enonce Powell. Despite his later anti-immigration views, whilst he was Health minister in the early 1960s he encouraged a large number of Commonwealth immigrants into the understaffed National Health Service. Prior to this, many non-white immigrants were often obliged to take the jobs that no one else wanted (e.g. street cleansing, night-shift assembly production lines), often paid considerably less than their white counterparts. Powell was vehemently opposed by the Trade Union movement (who feared that immigrants were being used by capitalists to keep wages low by artificially increasing competition for jobs), but there is no doubt that in easing non-white immigrants into what was considered a prestigious form of career, he boosted the confidence of the immigrant population and helped lay the foundations of a future immigrant-descended permanent Afro-Caribbean and Asian middle class in Britain<br><a href=\"#p120399680\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120399680<\/a><br>Good genetics.

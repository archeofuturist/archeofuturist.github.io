What I fear is that our current technology is actually fast-tracking both extremes, instead of letting time guide us towards a sensible middle-ground.

I feel that the &quot;micro-news&quot; we consume - two-minute videos, click-bait titles, and tweets - are undermining our natural ability to slowly and thoughtfully process information, and the only way to keep up is to adapt and make snap judgments based on the minimal amount of information.

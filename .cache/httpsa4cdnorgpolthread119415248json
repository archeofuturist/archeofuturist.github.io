I&#039;ll give you that. But there are useful themes that pervade different political groups. And the political spectrum is actually a fairly complex document that has been tailored as time goes on and for different countries. <br><br>For example, a liberal in Canada is quite different from a liberal in the United States. Similarly, a libertarian in the United States, even though it falls on the right wing of the spectrum, is different from a Canadian conservative.","time":1491277678,"resto":119415248,"id":"+mL818pi","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119426650,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)23:48:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"Soros urges giving Ukraine $50 billion of aid to foil Russia:<br>http:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-u<wbr>kraine-crisis-soros-idUSKBN0KH0NQ20<wbr>150108","time":1491277686,"resto":119415248,"id":"KBiwYokH","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119426790,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)23:49:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"George Soros funds Ferguson Black Lives Matter protests:<br>http:\/\/www.washingtontimes.com\/news<wbr>\/2015\/jan\/14\/george-soros-funds-fer<wbr>guson-protests-hopes-to-spur\/?page=<wbr>all","filename":"mccain_soros","ext":".jpg","w":497,"h":335,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":84,"tim":1491277768584,"time":1491277768,"md5":"LgV+7JaR\/f8HRZAJnPhanQ==","fsize":16519,"resto":119415248,"id":"KBiwYokH","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119426807,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)23:49:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119426118\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119426118<\/a><br>Well we can&#039;t really do anything about it and that&#039;s the problem, if that shit stayed in the hugbox then i wouldn&#039;t see any reason why not to have these kinds of hugboxes, but people are starting to take opinions as facts here, and that&#039;s the real problem that hugboxes are creating.

He just knows that, similar to Britain, there is a lot of nostalgia for the good old days when Russia was a threatning super power and tries to please them by appearing like a ruthless guy who has everything under control. The truth is he really appreciates the economic benefit he gets from cooperation with Europe and is much too afraid to start shit with it. America trying to paint him as the bad guy all the time is annoying him, so when Trump won and that bullshit stopped is welcomed by him but there really was no conspiracy that he explicitely tried to get Trump into office.

Per the 10th Amendments, States have authority over everything not explicitly granted to the federal government. This is a logical way for power to be granted, since our federal government was created by the States, not the other way around.<br><br>The &quot;Bill of Rights&quot; was further written to give our federal government even more explicit directions in things it absolutely must not do in the process of carrying out the powers they were granted. For example, in Article I Section 8, Congress is given the power &quot;to regulate Commerce... among the several States&quot;. This power was granted in response to disputes between States over use of navigable waters between States, protectionism against neighboring States, and so on causing problems before the Constitution was written. However, &quot;Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof...&quot; per the First Amendment. So, while Congress has the legitimate authority to regulate Commerce among the several States, they cannot use this authority to punish a particular religious group transferring religious texts from one State to another. This example isn&#039;t particularly relevant to the problems of the day, but should help you understand federal authority in the Constitution.<br><br>The problem arises with the Commerce Clause mentioned above and the 14th Amendment. For example, the Left interprets the power &quot;to regulate Commerce... among the several States&quot; as giving Congress virtual plenary power over all economic activities, both those a person chooses to participate in and chooses NOT to participate in, whether or not their Commerce leaves the State. Perhaps the two most significant cases relevant to expanding Congressional authority under the Commerce Clause were Wickard v. Filburn (1942) and National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius (2012), which I had mentioned previously.","time":1490692536,"resto":118612248,"id":"DdQfDPc2","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118631177,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)05:16:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"Who \/greathealthcare\/ here","time":1490692592,"resto":118612248,"id":"uB7ES2HY","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":118631223,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)05:17:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118613797\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118613797<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Would you live in a community that didn&#039;t have them?<\/span><br><br>I have.

District of Columbia - 1981 \u2013 Two women were upstairs in a townhouse when they heard their roommate, a third woman, being attacked downstairs by intruders.

After about 30 minutes, when their roommate\u2019s screams had stopped, they assumed the police had finally arrived.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;When the two women went downstairs they saw that in fact the police never came, but the intruders were still there. As the Warren court graphically states in the opinion: \u201cFor the next fourteen hours the women were held captive, raped, robbed, beaten, forced to commit sexual acts upon each other, and made to submit to the sexual demands of their attackers.\u201d The three women sued the District of Columbia for failing to protect them, but D.C.\u2019s highest court exonerated the District and its police, saying that it is a \u201cfundamental principle of American law that a government and its agents are under no general duty to provide public services, such as police protection, to any individual citizen.\u201d Warren v.

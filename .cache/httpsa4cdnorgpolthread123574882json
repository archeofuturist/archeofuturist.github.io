Everytime I see what Hitler did, I think, yeah that&#039;s a good idea. Literally did nothing wrong. BUT WHY!<br>WHY? <br>Why did he invade Russia? I wouldve been sieg heiling all day if it wasnt for that. I&#039; m a Russian thats living in the US currently and I am so torn. But I just cant look up to Hitler because my people take priority over anything. You have no idea how tortured I am. On the one hand I celebrate May 9th as a glorious victory over the invaders if the sacred Fatherland, on the other, I lament the passing of a great civilization. What do I do? May 9th (Victory in Europe,) is coming up soon, but I don&#039;t know if I can even celbrate that anymore.

It is a circle inscribed inside a square. The Earth and the Moon conform absolutely to this simplest of geometrical figures. Let us imagine that the green circle represents the Earth. If this was the case, then everything in the drawing that is not green and is shown in red, would represent the Moon.<br><br>The drawing is an expression of a mathematical fact. It represents the relationship between \u03c0 (Pi) and the number 4. The symbol \u03c0 appears time and again in mathematics and it has fascinated people for at least 6,000 years. \u03c0 defines the relationship of the diameter of a circle to its circumference. The true definition of \u03c0 cannot be discovered because it appears to go on forever. However, if we round it off at the fourth decimal point we could say that \u03c0 is 3.1416. This is exactly what the builders of the Moon did \u2013 they considered \u03c0 to be equal to 3.1416 \u2013 which is yet another way we know that the Moon cannot be a natural object.<br><br>The relationship of \u03c0 and the number 4 throws up a number of ratios. <br>\u03c0 + 0.366 of \u03c0 = 4.<br><br>We could also express this as 27.322% of \u03c0 added to \u03c0 would equal 4.<br><br>The relationship of the Earth and the Moon throws up the same ratios. <br>Earth\u2019s polar circumference, plus 0.366 of Earth\u2019s polar circumference equals Earth and Moon size combined. As a result it would also be correct to say that the Moon is equal to 27.322% of the size of the polar Earth.<br><br>Who Built the Moon?

Which is why it&#039;s pretty clear to me that the far left requires censorship and threats and moderation to keep their narrative intact. <br><br>This board is an example of it, the nazi larpers aside, and the nazi satire aside as board culture to scare leftists away this board is essentially center right, same as any other place that doesn&#039;t heavily censor speech, and the far leftists infecting this board are not even moderated either, they have their marxist general and all these things, whilst acting as if pol\/acks are &quot;oppressing&quot; them.. whilst they deliberately drive out anyone remotely to the right out of places like reddit, like what they are doing to r\/the_donald right now. <br><br>When you take away the regulations, you get center right boards all over the place, almost never do you get center left. Unless it&#039;s a circle jerk where only leftists go. And there&#039;s plenty of leftyfags on pol either lurking or shitposting.","time":1490954272,"resto":119036711,"id":"RTXhe8QW","country":"DK","country_name":"Denmark"},{"no":119042249,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)06:04:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119041856\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119041856<\/a><br>(cont) <br>Why because it occurs more and more to me especially with all this polarization occuring in the media that center right is the default peoples position.. we want government but not too big, we want to pay taxes but not too much but enough so that people who have it rough are taken care of, we believe in self responsibility and self accountability and self reliance rather than nanny state and so on and so forth.. so slightly right of center. <br><br>The far left wants big government to give them whatever they want, they don&#039;t believe in self accountability or self reliance, if they are worse off, it&#039;s not them that have to change no they are victims that the state then has to address and have to punish the ones who assail them.. <br><br>Then you can go massively far left or massively far right, but i have to be honest with you, the far right is so fucking tiny and the far left is MASSIVE MASSIVE MASSIVE.. people running around all over the web calling people facists and nazi&#039;s and racists and &quot;fuck all white people&quot; <br><br>The mistake that has lead the US astray is that the center has become the far left, and so anything remotely towards center is right wing or literally hitler and fascist nazi.. and as a result you have boards like this to push back towards it..<br><br>Sometimes the people on the left is right about some things, sometimes the people on the right is correct about such things. You should look up jordan b peterson talking about this.. Noticing the obvious DIFFERENCES between people.. people on the right tend to be extremely analytical and mathematical and are GREAT at running things and sticking to the rules. People on the left are good at system breaking things and good at also breaking a few rules to come up with new and bright ideas that they then need the right to run correctly because the left don&#039;t know how to run things properly. <br><br>We both need eachother.","time":1490954656,"resto":119036711,"id":"RTXhe8QW","country":"DK","country_name":"Denmark"},{"no":119042266,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)06:04:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119041856\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119041856<\/a><br>I voted for Trump, I never said I hated the dude.

Excellent and yes i agree! We have to be objective, this partisan shit has got to go we have to see what we need in the specific situation, and in the case of the US, they need a heavy dose of pragmatic right leaning politics right now.. Or it&#039;s going to crumble. Simple as that.. too much debt too many problems caused by unchallenged ideas from the far left.. It&#039;s gone too far left.. it&#039;s really as simple as that.. need to get the conversation a bit closer towards the center and get rid of that nasty polarization of you are either far left or you are literally hitler and fuck all white people cause all white people are literally hitler and fascist and nazi, it&#039;s such an ignorant proposition being peddled from the left, and it&#039;s only gone so far left because it has been unchallenged.. with the predictable result that &quot;all white people are literally hitler and nazi&quot; many majority white nations (yes we are not that many globally, we never were, just extremely effective at what we do so we dominate quite a bit of what happens in the world) But this either you are a commie or you are a nazi shit has got to go..","time":1490955231,"resto":119036711,"id":"RTXhe8QW","country":"DK","country_name":"Denmark"}]}

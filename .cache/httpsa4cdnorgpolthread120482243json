The Nazis learned this lesson 70 years ago. A few tiger tanks might win a local engagement, but they won&#039;t turn the tide of the battle when the enemy has total operational superiority. The call of duty playing millennial generation American soldiers, who had grown up in an age of low intensity conflicts and precision munitions, are in for a rude awakening when they are mercilessly crushed by the Korean People&#039;s Army.<br><br>The Korean People&#039;s Army is a mechanized juggernaut possessing thousands of artillery, tanks, and is made up of milions of men and women who are determined to carry out the orders of the supreme commander at any cost. Although Socialist Korea&#039;s air force is not the most up to date, but it, along with her artillery and strategic rocket forces, are more than capable of wiping out American and SK airpower on the ground in a first strike scenario. After that it&#039;s game over for the Americans and South Koreans as the KPAF operates with total aerial supremacy while the KPA ground forces mops up any remaining resistance.

This is a victory for LGBT Nebraskans,\u201d said Danielle Conrad, executive director of the ACLU of Nebraska, which filed the lawsuit on behalf of the couples.<br><br>The high court also affirmed the lower court\u2019s order that the state pay the costs and attorneys fees of the couples.<br><br>The lawsuit was brought by Joel Busch and Todd Vesely, who passed the training and home studies to become foster parents; Greg and Stillman Stewart, who had previously adopted five foster children in California; and Lisa Blakey and Janet Rodriguez.<br><br>Since the 2015 ruling, Busch and Vesely have since been able to open their home to help children in need, Conrad said Friday.<br><br>Critics of the 2015 ruling said it was too broad. They also said it should be up to HHS to give priority to heterosexual married couples, arguing that children do best in such arrangements.","filename":"gayrodeo","ext":".jpg","w":420,"h":236,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1491714947601,"time":1491714947,"md5":"d2ElYT6A\/YWRZutKI96IRw==","fsize":26924,"resto":0,"id":"huGKjLb5","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"nebraska-supreme-court-upholds-rights-of-gay","country_name":"United States","replies":4,"images":2,"unique_ips":3},{"no":120243570,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)01:23:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"it never ended<br><br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Frank<wbr>lin_child_prostitution_ring_allegat<wbr>ions","filename":"wtpage1small","ext":".gif","w":725,"h":435,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":75,"tim":1491715402221,"time":1491715402,"md5":"XPHTFiF2k9IxaljPB7Q7IA==","fsize":96395,"resto":120242742,"id":"nqXkdXo2","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120243858,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)01:26:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"Somewhere in Nebraska, a man is crying, wondering what happened to Cornhusker Football and his state.","time":1491715569,"resto":120242742,"id":"X5NILoVC","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120243932,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)01:26:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120243858\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120243858<\/a><br>How exactly does this hurt men watching football?","time":1491715609,"resto":120242742,"id":"huGKjLb5","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120243985,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)01:27:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120243858\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120243858<\/a><br>Also, your appeals to emotion are every bit as shameless as those effected by the left.","filename":"sadjew","ext":".jpg","w":772,"h":452,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":73,"tim":1491715646508,"time":1491715646,"md5":"xusITw2PbogoU1otIYp5BQ==","fsize":41463,"resto":120242742,"id":"huGKjLb5","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

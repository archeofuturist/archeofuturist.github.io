It worked, she won nothing in the second round. I personally believe the establishment parties will do the same in the presidential election, she will definitely go to the second round, but she does not have enough voters backing her up to stand against two big parties. So let us cross our fingers and hope for the best.","time":1492902551,"resto":122340193,"id":"DDGpbGE0","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":122342933,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)19:11:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"idk, they never talk about it, i know nothing about it.","time":1492902674,"resto":122340193,"id":"TFfKwwXX","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122343464,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)19:15:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122340193\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122340193<\/a><br>half Francophone\/ half English Canadian here.....

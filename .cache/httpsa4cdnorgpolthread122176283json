It often claims to be concerned with notions of cultural decline or decadence, and seeks to achieve a national rebirth by suppressing the interests of the individual, and instead promoting cults of unity, energy and purity.<br><br>In economics, Fascism sees itself as a third way between laissez-faire Capitalism on the one hand and Communism or Socialism on the other. It acknowledges the roles of private property and the profit motive as legitimate incentives for productivity, but only insofar as they do not conflict with the interests of the state. Fascist governments tend to nationalize key industries, closely manage their currencies and make massive state investments. They also tend to introduce price controls, wage controls and other types of economic planning measures (such as state-regulated allocation of resources, especially in the financial and raw materials sectors).<br><br>The term &quot;fascismo&quot; was coined by the Italian Fascist dictator Benito Mussolini (1883 - 1945) and the self-described &quot;philosopher of Fascism&quot; Giovanni Gentile (1875 - 1944).

It is the original model which inspired other Fascist ideologies, and is generally referred to simply as Fascism. It grew out of Mussolini&#039;s desire to re-affirm Italian national identity and pride after so many centuries of disunity leading up to the unification of 1870. Similar movements appeared throughout the world (including Europe, Japan, and Latin America) between World War I and World War II.<br><br>Nazism (or National Socialism) refers to the ideology and practices of the German Nazi Party (or National Socialist German Workers&#039; Party) under Adolf Hitler (1889 - 1945) between 1933 and 1945. It was a strongly nationalist, totalitarian, racist, anti-Semitic and anti-Communist movement, which grew up in the aftermath of German humiliation after World War I, which was partly blamed on Germany&#039;s Jews. Hitler published his political beliefs in &quot;Mein Kampf&quot; in 1925 and, inspired by the Italian Fascism of Mussolini, assumed dictatorial powers as Chancellor in 1933. His belief in the superiority of an Aryan race and the possibilities of eugenics (racial purification), his fierce anti-Semitism and anti-Communism, combined with his militaristic and expansionist ambitions led to World War II, with its atrocities and genocide, eventual military defeat and the subsequebt abandonment of Nazism as a viable ideology.<br><br>Clerical Fascism is an ideology that combines the political and economic doctrines of Fascism with theology or religious tradition. The term originally emerged in the 1920s referring to Catholic support for the Fascist regime of Benito Mussolini, but has since been applied to various regimes and movements, particularly in Europe and South America.&quot;","time":1492813452,"resto":122176283,"id":"bnBSg31M","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122195080,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)18:25:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122176283\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122176283<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;all these fakey-fake jerkoffs claiming to be liberal<\/span><br>REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE","time":1492813522,"resto":122176283,"id":"BipxINkT","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122195192,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)18:26:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122176283\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122176283<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;not being monarchist<\/span><br>Step it up, faggots.","time":1492813576,"resto":122176283,"id":"82U+a2Rs","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122195194,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)18:26:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122176845\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122176845<\/a>","time":1492813578,"resto":122176283,"id":"WifPc9lO","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122195346,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)18:27:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122194942\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122194942<\/a><br>Seem to have dropped to a more simplistic level with more propaganda in it with this one.

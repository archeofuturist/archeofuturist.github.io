In Bov\u00e9&#039;s case, the intruder was McDonald&#039;s, the American fast food chain (referred to in a satirical way by Bov\u00e9 and his supporters as &quot;McDo&quot;). On 12 August 1999 Bov\u00e9 and his confr\u00e8res from the Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration paysanne, the second largest farmers&#039; union in France, &quot;dismantled&quot; a McDonald&#039;s under construction in Millau, a town of approximately 20,000 inhabitants on the wind swept Larzac plateau. Earlier in January 1988 he and his comrades destroyed genetically modified maize in a grain silo in N\u00e9rac in the department of Lot-et-Garonne. While he received an eight month suspended sentence for the N\u00e9rac incident, the action in Millau brought Bov\u00e9, the spokesperson for the Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration paysanne, several weeks in jail but also national and international publicity.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;At his trial, an estimated 40,000 people from France and around the world showed up to support Bov\u00e9 and his cause.<\/span><br><br>What triggered Bov\u00e9&#039;s attack on McDonald&#039;s in Millau was a dispute between the United States and its World Trade Organization (WTO) supporters on one side and Europe on the other. When the WTO backed the right of the U.S. to export hormone induced beef to Europe and the Europeans resisted, the U.S. imposed heavy duties on certain luxury products as a retaliatory measure. One of the items targeted by the U.S. was Roquefort cheese - the same cheese that Bov\u00e9 produced on his sheep farm. According to the Canadian journalist and activist Naomi Klein, Bov\u00e9&#039;s actions in Millau represented an attack &quot;against an agricultural model that sees food purely as an industrial commodity rather than the centerpiece of national culture and family life.&quot;[5]","filename":"french-farm-workers-union-leader-jose-bove-attends-a-supporters-meeting-gtthb0","ext":".jpg","w":433,"h":320,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":92,"tim":1493495892609,"time":1493495892,"md5":"iqa8NdPWD8jZmoaW019bOw==","fsize":36798,"resto":123362268,"id":"Qap4N2qz","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123373506,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)15:58:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123373414\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123373414<\/a><br>The latter.

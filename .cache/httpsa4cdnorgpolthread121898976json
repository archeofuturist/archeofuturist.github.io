That&#039;s why I made the thread, in the hopes that between the nig nog talk some people would throw in some actual insight. <br>The foreign aid thing seems very likely, but not knowing how much we&#039;re sending over and how much it takes to feed that ridiculous amount of people it&#039;s hard to say how impactful it is. At this point I&#039;m thinking we should just dust the whole fucking place in seeds and never send anything else over again. Of course I&#039;ve admitted I&#039;m uneducated since I&#039;ve never actually been there.","filename":"1459114926450","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":640,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492638558493,"time":1492638558,"md5":"E3cbZ5b5EEOn9AvvwEonIQ==","fsize":52291,"resto":121898976,"id":"Q5IIHjpi","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121902387,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)17:49:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121901670\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121901670<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;your brainwashing media.<\/span><br>you mean history books? every hidden culture to the world, isolated as they were, built glorious monuments to their existence and developed farming techniques.<br><br>africans, inspired by superior cultures, stacked some mud into a castle that crumbles every year.","time":1492638570,"resto":121898976,"id":"HrOK8JsJ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121902402,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)17:49:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121901797\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121901797<\/a>","filename":"1492236440302","ext":".png","w":697,"h":8275,"tn_w":10,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492638577325,"time":1492638577,"md5":"PlJIsp7Ucu4OUq0\/e4W+8A==","fsize":1959894,"resto":121898976,"id":"i6Vcd35v","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":121902413,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)17:49:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121898976\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121898976<\/a><br><br>Niggers can farm, as i said they gud at picking up cotton u dumb neggroo<br><br><br>Get ur history straight faggot","time":1492638581,"resto":121898976,"id":"SLkcP2ml","country":"HR","country_name":"Croatia"},{"no":121902561,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)17:50:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121900291\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121900291<\/a><br>Not with all those political revolutions going about.","time":1492638645,"resto":121898976,"id":"ofGid4Cv","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121902575,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)17:50:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"It&#039;s funny.

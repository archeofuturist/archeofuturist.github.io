Likewise, the benefits of actually adopting intensive agriculture are not immediate at all. Roman citizens in the Marian reforms were arguably less healthy than tribes that lived in the mountains in anarchy without farming because they had more varied diets. <br><br>In modern Africa, it fucking sucks to be a sustenance farmer in most areas; you have no security that you will actually benefit from your harvest.

Many Africans are nomadic herders instead of farmers, and require large spaces to move their herds around. These shepherds often conflict with national park concerns. Another problem is that a lot of the regions that farm a lot usually do so with a single crop and aren&#039;t subsistence farmers, but they often have difficulty competing in a global market (look at coffee). However, the biggest problem all around is that a lot of African governments don&#039;t support farming. Africa wants to jump in with the big boys in the world instead of working with what the continent has been blessed with almost more than any other natural resource, arable land. Instead, they want first-world cities and financial centers.

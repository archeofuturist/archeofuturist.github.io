Imprisonment maks no sense.<br><br>&quot;Let&#039;s expend resources to &#039;punish&#039; convicted criminals by separating them from society until we let them back in, probably worse than when they came&quot;<br><br>A much better option would be making THEM pay ludicrous amounts of money for their crime, deport them out of the country, or, if they are truly dangerous, kill them.<br><br>&quot;Where would we deport them?&quot; Probably some South American nation, honestly, because America basically owns their economies and can do what they want.<br><br>&quot;What if they commit crimes to get out of debt?&quot; Avoid this by deporting them and making them pay the fine to come back. Coming back in illegally would be treated differently from normal illegal immigration and would be punishable by death.<br><br>Why is this a bad idea? Everybody would save money, America would soon be cleansed of criminals and the criminal factories that are prisons and crime might be discouraged more.<br><br>Aside from vague moral stuff, is there a reason why no countries do this type of stuff and they all use modern prisons?","filename":"unnamed-3","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":390,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":152,"tim":1491267229469,"time":1491267229,"md5":"i+78mJotag+au4\/YJ7sWdA==","fsize":125330,"resto":0,"id":"cyqL7FmU","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"arent-prisons-a-stupid-idea","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":119407786,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)20:57:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"I know you already said we could just export them to South America, but how would that work?

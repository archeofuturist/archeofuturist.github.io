I must say just reading the book is not enough to understand it, it requires additional background readings. Simplified example: Brave New World was inspired by communists, quiet obvious from names like LeninA. In early soviet union there existed practices of sexual promiscuity. One commie feminist said that sex is just a physical need like thirst. They encouraged women to have sex with proles requesting it. It resulted in spread of STD&#039;s and rapes. Eventually Stalin stopped the practice and purged commie jews like Trotsky who supported promiscuity, USSR drifted from BNW into 1984. Now we have leftists pushing polyamory(everyone belongs to everyone) and love(cummies-feelies). Before Reading Machiavelli read\/watch documentaries about Julius Cesar, Marcus Aurelius, Venice. <br><a href=\"#p123799107\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123799107<\/a><br>I think that helmet is blocking your vision, Knight Here <a href=\"#p123796869\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123796869<\/a> in Tier 1","filename":"mr","ext":".jpg","w":2392,"h":3348,"tn_w":89,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493750603922,"time":1493750603,"md5":"YPKdEH1Ju4FEtKcuTwZFOg==","fsize":1899288,"resto":123796671,"id":"3RmjAvuJ","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":123801596,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)14:44:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123801432\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123801432<\/a><br>you&#039;re wasting your fucking time<br>if you want to get anything done in the real world<br>stop being a goynigger<br>find a Torah, start reading<br>then you&#039;ll stop bitching about us","filename":"serveimage","ext":".gif","w":158,"h":180,"tn_w":109,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493750685674,"time":1493750685,"md5":"IrahLybwVPkjljXGtwnYtQ==","fsize":15534,"resto":123796671,"id":"8WNUAsi5","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123802497,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)14:52:00","name":"Anonymous","filename":"IMG_1725","ext":".jpg","w":4000,"h":3549,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":110,"tim":1493751120003,"time":1493751120,"md5":"N3hGN7EwJuJOKWrQmBiG\/A==","fsize":1039752,"resto":123796671,"id":"FQbK6lSF","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":123802612,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)14:52:55","name":"Anonymous","filename":"IMG_1726","ext":".jpg","w":1017,"h":1060,"tn_w":119,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493751175661,"time":1493751175,"md5":"W44zCItvFYLPkaFxbcaZEA==","fsize":547269,"resto":123796671,"id":"FQbK6lSF","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":123802715,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)14:53:44","name":"Anonymous","filename":"IMG_1728","ext":".jpg","w":1016,"h":1060,"tn_w":119,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493751224531,"time":1493751224,"md5":"NSw\/idLkYZJ9YEfSiyA9Kw==","fsize":538991,"resto":123796671,"id":"FQbK6lSF","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":123803329,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)14:58:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123801596\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123801596<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Torah<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;you&#039;ll stop bitching about us<\/span><br>Fuck off kike, your true sacred book is the Talmud.

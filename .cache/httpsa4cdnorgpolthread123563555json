Depending on where you live mortgages and home expenses cost more than renting while some places its the exact opposite. I live in the south where if you&#039;re smart you can buy a home or $50-70k that would be $600-700\/mo to rent. Compare that to renting while in Alexandria where a place that goes for $1500-2000\/mo would cost you $500-750k and property taxes out the wazoo. The key is to do your research and not get cucked.","filename":"Gaybaldmankidnapsfatunderprivilegedfilipinoboy","ext":".png","w":369,"h":505,"tn_w":91,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493606212486,"time":1493606212,"md5":"O3mJBArZBJGhmNgFPrUeRw==","fsize":119451,"resto":123563555,"id":"lQlnzbdb","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123566064,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)22:37:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123563555\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123563555<\/a><br>Apartment is for liberals and losers","time":1493606269,"resto":123563555,"id":"+vqjYT94","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":123566213,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)22:39:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123564231\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123564231<\/a><br><br>OP posted a pic from a IASIP episode where Dennis and Mac (actually rent ironically) a house in the suburbs.

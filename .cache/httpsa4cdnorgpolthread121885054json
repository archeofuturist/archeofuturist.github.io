There are multiple steps that we must take to hold the entire continent of Europe. This is a necessity.<br><br>1) The UK. Just as how the civil war occurred in the United States, secession is deemed illegal in the EU. Once a member state has joined, they cannot leave. Thus what the UK is committing is a treasonous act. The invasion of the UK should begin once they have &quot;ceased&quot; to be a member state. The UK must remain a member of the EU. The military attack will be difficult but the UK is no match for the entire EU.<br><br>2) Switzerland. This is a pussy country. They are surrounded by 3 giant countries in France, Germany and Italy. Switzerland can be invaded by 3 checkpoints and they would fall in a week. Easy.<br><br>3) Norway. Again, they hold a pathetic military and with the UK back in as a member state, we can easily invade their pathetic country. The seas would be ours. If Norway tries to act cheeky, we have a nuke at hand. 1 nuke on Oslo would do the trick.<br><br>4) The Balklans want to join so that&#039;s easy.<br><br>5) Russia. Arguably the hardest to attain. However unlike Hitler, the whole continent can team together and invade Russia. So they would go. If they use Nukes, we use Nukes. Russia is a frozen shithole and their people probably would vote to join anyway.<br><br>Any more ideas?","filename":"European Union","ext":".jpg","w":960,"h":871,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":226,"tim":1492630825707,"time":1492630825,"md5":"Lu1GT7dCnh2IpwvGpbGoMQ==","fsize":117940,"resto":0,"id":"m7OzEoRL","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"eu-european-union","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":69,"images":13,"unique_ips":40},{"no":121885777,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)15:45:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121885054\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121885054<\/a><br>Wow Switzerland, Norway and a good majority of the balkans must be redpilled.

Law means shit here when you&#039;re a powerful person and affiliated to the current leading political party<br><br>I had hopes of Trump draining his swamp and then maybe draining ours, since most of our politicians are way worse than Satan, but i have now lost hopes since Trump has broke each and every one of his promises, i can only dream of that wall being built so cartels are limited to tunnels and naval smuggling, wich should be easier for your police forces to detect and destroy<br><br>There is no hope for this country. I might move to Colorado after i finish my master&#039;s degree<br><br>Godspeed \/pol\/, and may our lord Jesus Christ someday punish everyone who keep this beautiful nation in the dumpster.","filename":"5674567546745695713566571","ext":".jpg","w":441,"h":784,"tn_w":140,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492311266096,"time":1492311266,"md5":"yrc3jQhBTPZEhGiWg3G1tw==","fsize":26046,"resto":0,"id":"NKQr+BDv","country":"MX","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"javier-duarte-apprehended-in-guatemala","country_name":"Mexico","replies":5,"images":2,"unique_ips":5},{"no":121307774,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)23:10:48","name":"Anonymous","filename":"567856785784778","ext":".png","w":320,"h":320,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492312248319,"time":1492312248,"md5":"eHLGWpCzbnQ7OU5GRp68kQ==","fsize":77876,"resto":121305630,"id":"NKQr+BDv","country":"MX","country_name":"Mexico"},{"no":121310756,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)23:36:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121305630\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121305630<\/a><br><br><a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/121306769#p121306769\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121306769<\/a>","time":1492313768,"resto":121305630,"id":"5g2Vjj8f","country":"MX","country_name":"Mexico"},{"no":121310904,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)23:37:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121305630\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121305630<\/a><br><br>Colorado is full faggot.","time":1492313858,"resto":121305630,"id":"quuYMLjm","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121311125,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)23:39:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;mexico is shit<\/span><br>who knew, but dont forget its racist to not want this in your country you xenophobic jerks","filename":"120417054555-ted-nugent-story-top","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":360,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1492313979386,"time":1492313979,"md5":"HGXI5uOwPQnclsj0NgGM6A==","fsize":67510,"resto":121305630,"id":"FL0J1Jsb","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121311319,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)23:41:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"I was told Mexico was a great country with no problems and I&#039;m racist for thinking anything else.

Law means shit here when you&#039;re a powerful person and affiliated to the current leading political party<br><br>I had hopes of Trump draining his swamp and then maybe draining ours, since most of our politicians are way worse than Satan, but i have now lost hopes since Trump has broke each and every one of his promises, i can only dream of that wall being built so cartels are limited to tunnels and naval smuggling, wich should be easier for your police forces to detect and destroy<br><br>There is no hope for this country. I might move to Colorado after i finish my master&#039;s degree<br><br>Godspeed \/pol\/, and may our lord Jesus Christ someday punish everyone who keep this beautiful nation in the dumpster.","filename":"5674567546745695713566571","ext":".jpg","w":441,"h":784,"tn_w":140,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492311266096,"time":1492311266,"md5":"yrc3jQhBTPZEhGiWg3G1tw==","fsize":26046,"resto":0,"id":"NKQr+BDv","country":"MX","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"javier-duarte-apprehended-in-guatemala","country_name":"Mexico","replies":1,"images":1,"unique_ips":1},{"no":121307774,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)23:10:48","name":"Anonymous","filename":"567856785784778","ext":".png","w":320,"h":320,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492312248319,"time":1492312248,"md5":"eHLGWpCzbnQ7OU5GRp68kQ==","fsize":77876,"resto":121305630,"id":"NKQr+BDv","country":"MX","country_name":"Mexico"}]}

I tried to get information out of him but he RARELY ever talked about it. Only got info from him a couple times. One time he said teh man&#039;s mouth opened without his lips moving, and a disembodied voice came from the middle of the bedroom, and when the voice stopped, the man&#039;s mouth closed. The man also levitated off the chair. Said that was teh only time he saw that.<br><br>The other thing mentioned was this. He and a catholic priest were helping the bellingham (washington state) police department in an ongoing case of ritual murders\/mutilations. What little I could get out of him was that children were being trafficked from Vancouver BC. Some police were involved in bellingham pd and other police departments all the way down the west coast. a few police officers from the lummi native american tribe were involved. I guess my father was getting death threats by a police officer in the lummi tribe. Kids are being taken from reservations and are being trafficked. My dad mentioned that acid was being used in the disposal of the bodies. This was not your garden variety Anton Levay Satanism from what I could gather. <br><br>I never really understood everything he was talking about until I saw Conspiracy of Silence and really began investigating SRA\/Human Trafficking.<br><br>This shit is real.","time":1490785221,"resto":118773091,"id":"3wzxg1Zr","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

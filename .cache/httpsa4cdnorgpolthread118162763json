I am also American. I live in New Zealand for work. I have visited Australia several times.<br><br>1. It is hot. I mean this. I am from Georgia. Georgia is like the back of a commercial freezer by comparison. It is not a nice, warm, happy holiday beach heat. It is an angry, oppressive heat. Understand that things are not supposed to live in Australia. It is not designed for life.<br><br>2. It is humid. This makes it feel even hotter. When you step outside, you instantly have a sheen of sweat all over your body. You will constantly feel like you just stepped out of a pool.<br><br>3. People are stupid. Again, I am from Georgia. I know stupid. These people are really stupid. I think it is the heat that damages their brains.<br><br>4. It is expensive. The alcohol especially. A slab of beer is $40 minimum. Even shitty beer. Bud is I think $48 a slab. A 700ml bottle of Jack is like $42. A litre (26) of Jim Beam I saw for $72 once. The only alcohol that isn&#039;t expensive is wine. You can get bottles of wine for $4.<br><br>5. The accent is really annoying. At first you are like &quot;oh that&#039;s interesting\/cool\/whatever&quot;. After a week you will hate it. After a month you will want to rip the throat out of every god damn Australian that talks to you. It has this kind of grating high pitched ring to it, even if they have a deep voice. I do not know why or how this works. It is nasally. Their words are annoying and stupid.<br><br>6. The police are faggots. They will annoy you about anything and everything. In Sydney it is basically illegal to bar hop. If you are at one bar and you have some drinks and you walk to another bar the cops will be like &quot;are you drunk&quot; and if they think you are drunk they will arrest you.<br><br>7. The bugs are terrible. Not even the poisonous ones. That&#039;s not even really a big deal. I&#039;ve never seen a poisonous snake even. The poison shit is a meme.

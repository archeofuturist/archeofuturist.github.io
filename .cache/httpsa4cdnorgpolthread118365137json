First you wouldn&#039;t have any moral values to call anything good or evil, and even if you did, all the evil that did happen would be meaningless because in the end there is no ultimate justice and whether you lived as a Mother Teresa or a Hitler makes no difference.<br><br>Now to address the issue itself, it&#039;s actually not a problem at all and the existence of evil in fact proves God&#039;s existence, because without him there would be no objective moral values at all. Also pain and suffering did not exist at first, they do now because of original sin and our fallen state, but God uses everything for good, and knows exactly what to allow and what to not allow for his will to come true. <br><br>We do not see this world from God&#039;s point of view, and cannot decide why some seemingly needless pain and suffering occurs. If Jesus didn&#039;t suffer and die, nobody would be saved, but when thinking like men we think we&#039;re doing the right thing (Like when Peter tried to save Jesus, not understanding that he had to die, because he was thinking like a man).<br><br>The &quot;problem of evil and suffering&quot;, can only actually be a problem, if God exists. You have to borrow from the Judeo-Christian morals to be able to disprove the Judeo-Christian God, because without him, there would be no objective morality as such.<br><br>Watch this: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Kg5<wbr>fTKWaqn4","filename":"rapetrump","ext":".png","w":1280,"h":720,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1490537834802,"time":1490537834,"md5":"0WtpvKG6PWkvekpk4aBhSg==","fsize":940234,"resto":118365137,"id":"gX1cSQkK","country":"LU","since4pass":2016,"m_img":1,"country_name":"Luxembourg"},{"no":118365622,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)10:17:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118365345\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118365345<\/a><br>He&#039;s addressing the Yahweh cults, you deist meme","time":1490537861,"resto":118365137,"id":"skZMvXAU","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118365698,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)10:18:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118365137\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118365137<\/a><br>This concerns only the morality of God, not his existence.

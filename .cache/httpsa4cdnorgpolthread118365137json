First you wouldn&#039;t have any moral values to call anything good or evil, and even if you did, all the evil that did happen would be meaningless because in the end there is no ultimate justice and whether you lived as a Mother Teresa or a Hitler makes no difference.<br><br>Now to address the issue itself, it&#039;s actually not a problem at all and the existence of evil in fact proves God&#039;s existence, because without him there would be no objective moral values at all. Also pain and suffering did not exist at first, they do now because of original sin and our fallen state, but God uses everything for good, and knows exactly what to allow and what to not allow for his will to come true. <br><br>We do not see this world from God&#039;s point of view, and cannot decide why some seemingly needless pain and suffering occurs. If Jesus didn&#039;t suffer and die, nobody would be saved, but when thinking like men we think we&#039;re doing the right thing (Like when Peter tried to save Jesus, not understanding that he had to die, because he was thinking like a man).<br><br>The &quot;problem of evil and suffering&quot;, can only actually be a problem, if God exists. You have to borrow from the Judeo-Christian morals to be able to disprove the Judeo-Christian God, because without him, there would be no objective morality as such.<br><br>Watch this: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Kg5<wbr>fTKWaqn4","filename":"rapetrump","ext":".png","w":1280,"h":720,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1490537834802,"time":1490537834,"md5":"0WtpvKG6PWkvekpk4aBhSg==","fsize":940234,"resto":118365137,"id":"gX1cSQkK","country":"LU","since4pass":2016,"m_img":1,"country_name":"Luxembourg"},{"no":118365622,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)10:17:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118365345\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118365345<\/a><br>He&#039;s addressing the Yahweh cults, you deist meme","time":1490537861,"resto":118365137,"id":"skZMvXAU","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118365698,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)10:18:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118365137\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118365137<\/a><br>This concerns only the morality of God, not his existence.

That simply means he has chosen to play by the rules of the game that prevent him from controlling us.With that being said, God (being God) is also outside of time and space for only he could create such phenomenon. This means that for him to STOP an evil act he would have to enter him and space and break his rule of non-interfeirence. And to add to that, since all mankind is evil in nature; some choosing to do good however, Why would God step in to deal with one kind of evil while letting an other evil continue? Logically if he truely is good in nature, he would be required to end ALL evil on the earth. Thereby destroying all mankind, animal and virus down to micro-scopic life. In fact one day exactly that will happen, when he finally brings justice to this world. But for now, it is out of his goodness that he gave us more time to fix our act and allow US the people, to administer justice and establish a better world.

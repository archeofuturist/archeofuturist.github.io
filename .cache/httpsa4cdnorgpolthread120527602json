Then, a period of class struggle follows in which the capitalist class is liquidated by the working class. When the capitalist class has been completely vanquished, there will be only one class, the working class, and eventually the functions of the state will become indistinguishable from the functions of the society as a whole, and the state as such will &#039;wither away&#039; as Marx said.<\/span><br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/ma<wbr>rx\/works\/1847\/11\/prin-com.htm<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/ma<wbr>rx\/works\/1848\/communist-manifesto\/<br><br>ML uses a philosophy called dialectical materialism, see here:<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/reference\/<wbr>archive\/stalin\/works\/1938\/09.htm<br><br>It is recommended that you read some of the critical works of Marxism-Leninism so you can make an informed assessment of the ideology.<br><br>Resources:<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/ma<wbr>rx\/works\/sw\/<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/le<wbr>nin\/works\/sw\/<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/reference\/<wbr>archive\/stalin\/works\/decades-index.<wbr>htm<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/reference\/<wbr>archive\/mao\/selected-works\/<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/ma<wbr>rx\/works\/1884\/origin-family\/<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/le<wbr>nin\/works\/1914\/mar\/11.htm","filename":"1481244074852","ext":".png","w":1010,"h":1010,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491873977368,"time":1491873977,"md5":"676S1nirnOI5InkeibSxFw==","fsize":177742,"resto":0,"id":"3fa\/bzoT","country":"ES","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"pol-communism-general","country_name":"Spain","replies":174,"images":78,"unique_ips":46,"tail_size":50},{"no":120527840,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)21:27:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"dude, go get a job","time":1491874057,"resto":120527602,"id":"lSZAfyMU","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":120528081,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)21:29:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120527602\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120527602<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Make Islam extinct again edition<\/span>","filename":"averageswedishwoman","ext":".jpg","w":287,"h":176,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":76,"tim":1491874145511,"time":1491874145,"md5":"uPFvSVFHpKSgGlDkQ2FdSg==","fsize":7071,"resto":120527602,"id":"8uJ8sm6B","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120528127,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)21:29:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"WW3 today, all commies are going to die","time":1491874162,"resto":120527602,"id":"Vkfl5cKE","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":120528346,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)21:30:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"Face the facts, NIGGERS, your race are a failed race because you&#039;re a feckless, unruly, uncivilized horde of feral proto humans.

The former was bred to exhibit certain characteristics wanton aggression, propensity to fight, physical strength, powerful bite, and so on. The latter was bred to retrieve birds shot and killed by its masters, and to do this, it has to have a docile, placid, non aggressive nature; otherwise it would treat what it found as its own kill and refuse to hand it over.","filename":"1468566665200","ext":".jpg","w":960,"h":541,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1491874326680,"time":1491874326,"md5":"kl3EtxNy\/PVoeEWC3cJzDA==","fsize":49887,"resto":120527602,"id":"euI1sL3S","country":"MX","country_name":"Mexico"},{"no":120528707,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)21:32:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"Now imagine that your small children, aged maybe two or three years old, are going to be locked in a room with five or six of those dogs, and the dogs haven&#039;t been fed for a week.

Or do you figure that, even though they look differently, they&#039;re all the same species really, so of course the pit bulls certainly won&#039;t act any differently? Exactly! All this PC crap we hear spouted in the media about how &quot;there&#039;s no such thing as race&quot; is just that crap.

Large groups of &quot;African Americans&quot; at liberty in the west actually deliberately break themselves down into smaller, tribal hordes, because they feel uneasy in and unaccustomed to a larger society.

Marx did not himself invent the term: he developed the concept. &quot;Surplus value&quot; is a translation of the German word &quot;Mehrwert&quot;, which simply means value added (sales revenue less the cost of materials used up). Conventionally, value-added is equal to the sum of gross wage income and gross profit income. However, Marx&#039;s use of this concept is different, because for Marx, the Mehrwert refers to the yield, profit or return on production capital invested, i.e. the amount of the increase in the value of capital. Hence, Marx&#039;s use of Mehrwert has always been translated as &quot;surplus value&quot;, distinguishing it from &quot;value-added&quot;. According to Marx&#039;s theory, surplus value is equal to the new value created by workers in excess of their own labor-cost, which is appropriated by the capitalist as profit when products are sold.","filename":"8b76112865c0dfe5b7169e44ea86ad6099ac7b0edd7f38716d4bb79a17b9da7d","ext":".png","w":220,"h":313,"tn_w":87,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491875634553,"time":1491875634,"md5":"C7Vv8qCkhnuSNDXMNMdcbg==","fsize":58276,"resto":120527602,"id":"yhQoAFuB","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120532328,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)21:54:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120532032\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120532032<\/a><br>not an argument","time":1491875653,"resto":120527602,"id":"yhQoAFuB","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120532445,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)21:54:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120532328\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120532328<\/a>","filename":"1e88ef93072de1aa129764cf745256d503b56b2ec5dda34430beb1789ff8c75e","ext":".jpg","w":550,"h":474,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":107,"tim":1491875697691,"time":1491875697,"md5":"EiFwv8Kcq9zqwnotF8MeOw==","fsize":40985,"resto":120527602,"id":"yhQoAFuB","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120532642,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)21:56:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120532445\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120532445<\/a>","filename":"1490984536389","ext":".jpg","w":699,"h":601,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":107,"tim":1491875763472,"time":1491875763,"md5":"+pHHL9TFZyEZkBmrXrlvUA==","fsize":141241,"resto":120527602,"id":"yhQoAFuB","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120532762,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)21:56:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120532642\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120532642<\/a>","filename":"kijpjqv6l1qy","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":495,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":123,"tim":1491875810761,"time":1491875810,"md5":"ac+ITujXdZvqcqScp9mxFg==","fsize":59823,"resto":120527602,"id":"yhQoAFuB","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120532830,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)21:57:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120532328\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120532328<\/a><br>we aren&#039;t debating nigger","filename":"nheeee","ext":".png","w":709,"h":623,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":109,"tim":1491875839965,"time":1491875839,"md5":"ujLfiYeYOn3+xgSD5Qohmg==","fsize":511529,"resto":120527602,"id":"Q\/So1KAv","country":"CL","country_name":"Chile"},{"no":120532873,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)21:57:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120532642\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120532642<\/a><br>Then why do you live in the USA?

Maybe in the 1840s people were worked like slaves, but today, workers have rights.","time":1491876397,"resto":120527602,"id":"KgFAtMGg","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120534242,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)22:06:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120534018\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120534018<\/a><br>so you are insecure with both your sexuality and your race?","time":1491876398,"resto":120527602,"id":"yhQoAFuB","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120534260,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)22:06:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120533906\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120533906<\/a><br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Obscu<wbr>rantism<br><br> (2) deliberate obscurity\u2014an abstruse style (as in literature and art) characterized by deliberate vagueness.[3][4] Therefore, an obscurantist is someone who actively opposes enlightenment and the consequent social reform, a type of anti-intellectual.","time":1491876407,"resto":120527602,"id":"SnwM8g1s","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":120534350,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)22:07:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120533151\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120533151<\/a><br>I don&#039;t even need to defend my beliefs.

You are not only not contributing to our great mother earth but actively destroying it with your filthy &quot;&quot;&quot;ideology&quot;&quot;&quot; of retardation. It is better for you to be dead than living in our world anon.","filename":"nottakingthebait","ext":".jpg","w":308,"h":308,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491879232668,"time":1491879232,"md5":"c88zXRXTeJSid\/v42J8F3Q==","fsize":26791,"resto":120527602,"id":"kOqYALzU","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120540891,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)22:54:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120540697\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120540697<\/a><br>Not an argument","time":1491879247,"resto":120527602,"id":"SnwM8g1s","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":120540899,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)22:54:10","name":"Anonymous","filename":"1491590902305","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":324,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":81,"tim":1491879250245,"time":1491879250,"md5":"a6BXspCoz14t5veRYReptQ==","fsize":50101,"resto":120527602,"id":"Q\/So1KAv","country":"CL","country_name":"Chile"},{"no":120540948,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)22:54:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120540850\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120540850<\/a><br>Not an argument","time":1491879268,"resto":120527602,"id":"SnwM8g1s","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":120540951,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)22:54:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120540787\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120540787<\/a><br><a href=\"#p120540842\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120540842<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Obsc<wbr>urantism<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;(2) deliberate obscurity\u2014an abstruse style (as in literature and art) characterized by deliberate vagueness.[3][4] Therefore, an obscurantist is someone who actively opposes enlightenment and the consequent social reform, a type of anti-intellectual.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Not an argument.<\/span>","time":1491879269,"resto":120527602,"id":"yhQoAFuB","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120541113,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)22:55:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120540951\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120540951<\/a><br>Not an argument","time":1491879331,"resto":120527602,"id":"SnwM8g1s","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":120541171,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)22:55:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"What incentive will I have to work under a communist society?","time":1491879350,"resto":120527602,"id":"wmz71UNS","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120541236,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)22:56:18","name":"Anonymous","filename":"1491591766390","ext":".png","w":500,"h":509,"tn_w":122,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491879378868,"time":1491879378,"md5":"6KQgBnBBqQHhm7iiyrQnHg==","fsize":155833,"resto":120527602,"id":"Q\/So1KAv","country":"CL","country_name":"Chile"},{"no":120541347,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)22:57:14","name":"Anonymous","filename":"1491591853342","ext":".png","w":644,"h":598,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":116,"tim":1491879434418,"time":1491879434,"md5":"IJ6ZVs5MIo\/2HTYtuYv96Q==","fsize":123449,"resto":120527602,"id":"Q\/So1KAv","country":"CL","country_name":"Chile"},{"no":120542263,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)23:03:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120541171\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120541171<\/a><br>The objection is known. &quot;If the existence of each is guaranteed, and if the necessity of earning wages does not compel men to work, nobody will work.

It was the refrain of the French noblemen in 1789, the refrain of the Middle Ages, a refrain as old as the world, and we shall hear it every time there is a question of sweeping away an injustice. And each time actual facts give it the lie. The liberated peasant of 1792 ploughed with a wild energy unknown to his ancestors, the emancipated Negro works more than his fathers, and the Russian peasant, after having honoured the honeymoon of his emancipation by celebrating Fridays as well as Sundays, has taken up work with as much eagerness as his liberation was the more complete. There, where the soil is his, he works desperately; that is the exact word for it.

Data indicates that crime in the United States started to decline in 1992. Donohue and Levitt suggest that the absence of unwanted children, following legalization in 1973, led to a reduction in crime 18 years later, starting in 1992 and dropping sharply in 1995. These would have been the peak crime-committing years of the unborn children.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The authors argue that states that had abortion legalized earlier should have the earliest reductions in crime. Donohue and Levitt&#039;s study indicates that this indeed has happened: Alaska, California, Hawaii, New York, Oregon and Washington experienced steeper drops in crime, and had legalized abortion before Roe v. Wade. Further, states with a high abortion rate have experienced a greater reduction in crime, when corrected for factors like average income.[5] Finally, studies in Canada and Australia claim to have established a correlation between legalized abortion and overall crime reduction.[5]<\/span>","time":1490878308,"resto":118913407,"id":"5BqeOg9+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118917684,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)08:52:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118914463\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118914463<\/a><br>This.

In part, the ban on abortions was designed to increase the Romanian population. Before this point, Romania had one of the most liberal abortion policies in the world, such that abortion was the single most common form of birth control in the country. At the same time, Ceau\u015fescu banned sex education in schools. Within one year, the birth rate in Romania had doubled. Twenty-three years later, a popular movement (made up largely of students in their late teens and early twenties) rose up against Ceau\u015fescu and had him executed by firing squad.

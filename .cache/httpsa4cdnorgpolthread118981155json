This brings the unrelated postings to the top of the forum list, and the critical posting &#039;slides&#039; down the front page, and quickly out of public view. Although it is difficult or impossible to censor the posting it is now lost in a sea of unrelated and unuseful postings. By this means it becomes effective to keep the readers of the forum reading unrelated and non-issue items.<\/span><br><br>(continues)","filename":"1479613530186","ext":".png","w":744,"h":586,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":98,"tim":1490915462172,"time":1490915462,"md5":"CgOfbWfBtSjwLQllJ57ROQ==","fsize":299603,"resto":118981155,"id":"kBmz0ARs","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118984337,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)19:11:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118984195\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118984195<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;desperately resorting to tired old tropes<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;doesn&#039;t have a rebuttal and just makes reddit jokes about Russia<\/span><br>kek","time":1490915471,"resto":118981155,"id":"aWP+z9Uh","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118984345,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)19:11:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"Daily Ratings Autism.<br>Tucker rolled an 88.

If you wanted to buy an ad on 4chan you pay X amount of money for Y page views. If your ad is for the sale of chairs and all 200,000 pages were viewed by people who dont need a new chair, then your advertising was a waste of money. This bill helps companies target their advertising, so that if someone has been looking for a new chair your chair ad will play for them.","time":1490880904,"resto":118907771,"id":"Z0AUW\/B3","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118920987,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)09:36:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118907771\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118907771<\/a><br>The first ISP that promises they won&#039;t sell their customers history will be the next big thing.","time":1490881005,"resto":118907771,"id":"HCZV8fos","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118921147,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)09:38:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118909299\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118909299<\/a><br><br>I&#039;m okay with that.<br><br>Porn is not free speech.<br><br>Fuck the porn industry.","filename":"1490734389631","ext":".png","w":642,"h":792,"tn_w":101,"tn_h":124,"tim":1490881126892,"time":1490881126,"md5":"r4WuIP3oCKph8HYAhfYfWw==","fsize":324965,"resto":118907771,"id":"8RHTmreD","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118921238,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)09:39:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118920987\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118920987<\/a><br>No. Because most people don&#039;t care about privacy.

The FTC had the authority to bring enforcement actions against companies who engaged in &quot;unfair and deceptive practices.&quot; The 2015 reclassification of broadband providers removed internet service providers (ISPs) from the FTC&#039;s jurisdiction. On April 20, 2016, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) proposed a rule applying privacy requirements of the Communications Act to Internet Service Providers (ISPs). However, the proposed rule would not apply to edge providers and web sites, like Facebook and Twitter, since they still fall under the FTC&#039;s authority.<br>As you know, Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona introduced S.J. Res. 34 on March 7, 2017. This resolution would repeal the FCC&#039;s privacy rules. I do not believe a two-track system in which the FCC regulates ISPs while the FTC monitors the rest of the internet ecosystem is good for consumers. For this reason I cosponsored S.J. Res 34.","time":1490811945,"resto":118812696,"id":"P2m7WRDY","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118815400,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)14:26:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118814297\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118814297<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;getting your news from a youtube &quot;comedian&quot;<\/span>","time":1490812008,"resto":118812696,"id":"P2m7WRDY","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118815448,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)14:27:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118812696\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118812696<\/a><br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Brian<wbr>_L._Roberts#Early_life_and_educatio<wbr>n<br><br>CEO of Comcast is a jew<br><br>GOP are a bunch of cucks and good goys who sold us out for a few shekels<br><br>There will still be idiots who will try to defend this and call people who don&#039;t support it shills","time":1490812038,"resto":118812696,"id":"QljZtJkd","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118815657,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)14:29:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118815079\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118815079<\/a><br><a href=\"#p118815400\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118815400<\/a><br><br>nothing he said is wrong though and unlike you guys he&#039;s actually doing activism against it.","time":1490812159,"resto":118812696,"id":"whkBUqQH","country":"AT","country_name":"Austria"},{"no":118815670,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)14:29:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118814297\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118814297<\/a><br>Isnt that literally a fallacy? <br>makes you think","time":1490812166,"resto":118812696,"id":"5Z8vjcIp","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118815696,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)14:29:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118815448\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118815448<\/a><br>t.liberal shill","time":1490812176,"resto":118812696,"id":"Jz8oWIgl","country":"RO","country_name":"Romania"},{"no":118815848,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)14:30:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118815179\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118815179<\/a><br>yes. our data was always available, so a little chip off of our rights wont hurt<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;10,000 chips later<\/span><br>ALLU AKBAR","time":1490812259,"resto":118812696,"id":"5Z8vjcIp","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118815849,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)14:30:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Internet privacy has been a thing for the last 10 years<\/span><br><br>This just made official what was already happening.

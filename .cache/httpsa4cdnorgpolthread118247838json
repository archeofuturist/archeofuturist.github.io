The first, of course, benefits the cheaters and their schools at both high school and university level. But the second perpetuates a much larger misconception: People really believe that our top high school students are taking ten-twelve AP courses during their high school year, maintaining 4.5 GPAs, and have the underlying knowledge one would expect from such study. But this almost certainly isn\u2019t true. And once you understand the reality, it\u2019s hard not to wonder about all the \u201cweeding out courses\u201d in organic chemistry and other brutal STEM college courses, the ones that Americans are abandoning in large numbers. The willingness to accept the cheating, to slap it on the wrist if that, is leading to lies that convince a lot of American kids that they aren\u2019t smart enough for tough courses because they don\u2019t cheat and aren\u2019t aware that others are.<\/span>","time":1490463860,"resto":118247838,"id":"EKpHD1EG","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118249504,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)13:46:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118247881\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118247881<\/a><br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=fKJ<wbr>EfqVg6Ho","time":1490463987,"resto":118247838,"id":"EKpHD1EG","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118249594,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)13:47:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118247838\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118247838<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;minority does well<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;they must be cheating! <\/span><br>Lmao.

Sparrow nests were torn down, eggs were broken, and nestlings were killed.[1][3] Sparrows and other birds were shot down from the sky, resulting in the near-extinction of the birds in China.[4] Non-material rewards and recognition were offered to schools, work units and government agencies in accordance with the volume of pests they had killed.<\/span><br><br>Some sparrows found refuge in the extraterritorial premises of various diplomatic missions in China. The personnel of the Polish embassy in Beijing denied the Chinese request of entering the premises of the embassy to scare away the sparrows who were hiding there and as a result the embassy was surrounded by people with drums. After two days of constant drumming, the Poles had to use shovels to clear the embassy of dead sparrows.[5]<br><br>By April 1960, Chinese leaders realized that sparrows ate a large amount of insects, as well as grains.[3][2] Rather than being increased, rice yields after the campaign were substantially decreased.[1][2] Mao ordered the end of the campaign against sparrows, replacing them with bed bugs in the ongoing campaign against the Four Pests.[3] By this time, however, it was too late. With no sparrows to eat them, locust populations ballooned, swarming the country and compounding the ecological problems already caused by the Great Leap Forward, including widespread deforestation and misuse of poisons and pesticides.[1] Ecological imbalance is credited with exacerbating the Great Chinese Famine, in which 20\u201345 million people died of starvation<br><br>I&#039;d would be surprised if the average IQ in china is 70","filename":"chinese humans","ext":".webm","w":300,"h":224,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1490469907506,"time":1490469907,"md5":"SfIF+ls3RM0aaK6uLmOiIQ==","fsize":2834631,"resto":118247838,"id":"9fw5McpG","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118260668,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)15:25:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118259837\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118259837<\/a><br>Yeah I have a BA in a liberal art lol.

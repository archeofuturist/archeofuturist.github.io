The proctor sighs, exhorts them not to cheat, and pretty much turns over control of the class to the students. At that point, the kids can quietly discuss answers, text a buddy for help, and basically \u201ccollaborate\u201d in any way needed.<\/span><br><br>https:\/\/educationrealist.wordpress.<wbr>com\/2013\/10\/08\/asian-immigrants-and<wbr>-what-no-one-mentions-aloud\/","filename":"copiando","ext":".jpg","w":700,"h":525,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1490463099949,"time":1490463099,"md5":"fPOPSMBA4Q6C9ISqKQ2EKw==","fsize":57366,"resto":0,"id":"EKpHD1EG","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"asian-students-and-chaos-cheating","country_name":"United States","replies":5,"images":0,"unique_ips":4},{"no":118247881,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)13:32:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"ALSO ACADEMIC RED-PILLS GENERAL.","time":1490463129,"resto":118247838,"id":"EKpHD1EG","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118248297,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)13:36:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"It&#039;s funny seeing foreign students come here and try to pull the same shit.

But if that\u2019s not bad enough\u2014and it is\u2014here\u2019s the thing: the cheating I describe perpetuates two frauds. The first, of course, benefits the cheaters and their schools at both high school and university level. But the second perpetuates a much larger misconception: People really believe that our top high school students are taking ten-twelve AP courses during their high school year, maintaining 4.5 GPAs, and have the underlying knowledge one would expect from such study. But this almost certainly isn\u2019t true. And once you understand the reality, it\u2019s hard not to wonder about all the \u201cweeding out courses\u201d in organic chemistry and other brutal STEM college courses, the ones that Americans are abandoning in large numbers. The willingness to accept the cheating, to slap it on the wrist if that, is leading to lies that convince a lot of American kids that they aren\u2019t smart enough for tough courses because they don\u2019t cheat and aren\u2019t aware that others are.<\/span>","time":1490463860,"resto":118247838,"id":"EKpHD1EG","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

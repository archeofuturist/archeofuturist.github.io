And the bad things that she did weren&#039;t little things. Atleast with Trump they could pepper in some things like being a successful business man or neutral things like having a TV show. But a large portion of their Trump coverage focused on really fucking stupid things like eating KFC with a knife and fork.","time":1491369148,"resto":119570068,"id":"xqIdq08b","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119570685,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)01:13:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119570068\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119570068<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;forbes<\/span>","time":1491369220,"resto":119570068,"id":"rZhKQ6Ll","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119570955,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)01:16:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119570571\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119570571<\/a><br> I guess my comment to you should be, &quot;Don&#039;t you believe Trump earned his negative press?&quot;","time":1491369402,"resto":119570068,"id":"aOgs+iM+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119571779,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)01:25:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"Poor brown-nosed Kevin&#039;s just trying to divert attention from TRUMP&#039;S Russian Connections and the devastating, humiliating TRUMP CARE debacle. Kevin&#039;s still sore that TRUMPY didn&#039;t name him Secretary of Energy, but gave it to the intellectual giant, Rick Perry, instead. Poor Kevin better not read the latest Quinnipiac Poll that shows 52% of Americans are EMBARRASSED that Trump&#039;s our so-called president. 61% believe that Don the Con&#039;s not honest and 57% believe that tRUMP doesn&#039;t care about average Americans. So, Kevin can have his interns write all the whiny letters he wants, it ain&#039;t gonna do anything but make him look even more stupid. When&#039;s he starting his Senate campaign against Heidi?

Dems are already trying to call off the investigation or distance themselves from the ImpeachTrump thing (most likely they have vested interest in a possible US-Syria conflict). Some of the committee names I can confirm (that are against the investigation) now are Jim Himes and Andre Carson. Schiff and Castro are keeping quiet about it but Schiff is most likely leaning towards continuing the investigation.

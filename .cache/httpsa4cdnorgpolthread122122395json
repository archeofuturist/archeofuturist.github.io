Not really. It&#039;s like if you have a corvette say, and someone steals it, you can think: Well I know why they stole it! They want to have the corvette! You know it&#039;s an understandable motivation to want power. It&#039;s not necessarily an admirable one. Although sometimes power is a perfectly reasonable thing to pursuit. But I don&#039;t know why we ever assumed that those guys were after victory. Like you should never make the presupposition that everyone is out to win. Some people are out to lose, and the more people they can take with them, the better. You know when Hitler died he committed suicide in a bunker way down below in Berlin whilst Berlin was on fire, and Europe was burning. You know it&#039;s like as far as I can tell that was exactly what Hitler was after right from the beginning.&quot; -JP<\/span>","time":1492771549,"resto":122122395,"id":"B9fL4zfh","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":122122925,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)06:47:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122122818\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122122818<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;leaf intellectuals<\/span>","time":1492771642,"resto":122122395,"id":"26Oyj9at","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122122931,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)06:47:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"Here&#039;s some more incoherent SHITE from Peterson:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;So anyways, long before we were practicing science, we were doing perfectly well - in sense without any real knowledge of the objective world at all.

There will always be outside forces manipulating the markets in one way or another. In an anarcho-capitalist society &quot;statelessness&quot; would quickly be wiped away as the corporations with the most money would simply form their own governments with rules that would make it easier for them to form monopolies within given industrial markets.

That&#039;s not a newsflash. That&#039;s common sense. A regulated market is fine. In the sense that it is regulated under a strong nationalistic state that supports civic virtue and meritocracy while ending the bourgeois modes of production that lead to nations being hijacked by (((monied interests))). This is especially true when you consider that (((these people))) historically made up the merchant and banking classes during the middle ages that formed the precursor to modern capitalism, which will always be an ideology based on materialistic bullshit as opposed to the ideas rooted in spiritual idealism.

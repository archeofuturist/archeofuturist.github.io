Ryan can&#039;t or won&#039;t unite the party behind Trump. It&#039;s not even never-Trumpers, it&#039;s just all the corruption being revealed one representative or senator at a time. They ALL want their share of pork barrel in everything Trump wants to do, making agreement practically impossible. Or, they ALL have some secret deal going on--like a share in the drug or kid trafficking businesses, for instance, or kickbacks from health insurance companies--which keeps them from uniting behind the main things Trump wants to do like the wall, or replacing\/fixing O-care. <br><br>Thing is, I wonder how many of these elite idiots realize that they&#039;re gonna get voted out in 2018 if they don&#039;t ship up?<br><br>What \/pol\/ and the new right generally speaking needs to do NOW NOW NOW is start bringing our own New Right\/New Republican candidates up to take their places.

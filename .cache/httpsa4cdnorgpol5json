He was transported to UMass Memorial Hospital-Leominster, where he was pronounced dead at 4:07 a.m.[10][92][93][11] State Department of Correction spokesman Christopher Fallon first said no suicide note was found in Hernandez&#039;s single-occupant cell, but on April 20, 2017, investigators reported that three handwritten notes were next to a Bible opened to John 3:16 and &quot;John 3:16&quot; was written on his forehead in ink.[94] One note said he was entering the &quot;timeless realm&quot; and would see his family in heaven while another note said he loved his family and told them not to shed a tear; soap was found covering the floor and there were drawings in blood on the walls showing an unfinished pyramid and the all-seeing eye of God with the word &quot;Illuminati&quot; written in capital letters underneath.[95] Prison officials had not observed any signs that Hernandez was at risk for suicide, so he was not put on around-the-clock watch.[96] Upon completion of the autopsy by the medical examiner, the death has been officially ruled a suicide. Hernandez&#039;s brain was released to Boston University to be studied for signs of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a progressive degenerative disease found in people who have had a severe blow or repeated blows to the head.[97] His lawyer-agent, Jose Baez, disputed any claim of suicide, initiating his own investigation of the death.[98]","filename":"image","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":667,"tn_w":187,"tn_h":249,"tim":1492996011008,"time":1492996011,"md5":"o7QH+rlsjEf0vDHYY\/vx3A==","fsize":76946,"resto":0,"id":"nIv4nKJw","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"illuminati-blood-pyramid","country_name":"United States","replies":3,"images":1},{"no":122520045,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)21:10:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"sa ge in options field.

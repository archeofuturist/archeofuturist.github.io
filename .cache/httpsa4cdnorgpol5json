A later corps of twelve became receivers for your world shortly after the Caligastia secession and continued in authority until the time of Adam and Eve. These twelve Melchizedeks returned to Urantia upon the default of Adam and Eve, and they continued thereafter as planetary receivers on down to the day when Jesus of Nazareth, as the Son of Man, became the titular Planetary Prince of Urantia.","time":1490763289,"resto":118732380,"id":"GfKKBmky","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118749215,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)00:55:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118748879\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118748879<\/a><br>There are plenty of videos about Moloch\\El\\Saturn on Youtube.

The Jews synthesized all gods into their more sublime concept of the Lord God of Israel. The Hindus likewise combined their multifarious deities into the \u201cone spirituality of the gods\u201d portrayed in the Rig-Veda, while the Mesopotamians reduced their gods to the more centralized concept of Bel-Marduk. These ideas of monotheism matured all over the world not long after the appearance of Machiventa Melchizedek at Salem in Palestine. But the Melchizedek concept of Deity was unlike that of the evolutionary philosophy of inclusion, subordination, and exclusion; it was based exclusively on creative power and very soon influenced the highest deity concepts of Mesopotamia, India, and Egypt.<br><br>96:0.2 (1052.2) The Salem religion was revered as a tradition by the Kenites and several other Canaanite tribes. And this was one of the purposes of Melchizedek\u2019s incarnation: That a religion of one God should be so fostered as to prepare the way for the earth bestowal of a Son of that one God. Michael could hardly come to Urantia until there existed a people believing in the Universal Father among whom he could appear.","time":1490763422,"resto":118732380,"id":"GfKKBmky","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118738754,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)23:07:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"How do we dispel of this notion \/pol\/?","filename":"IMG_3964","ext":".jpg","w":588,"h":64,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":27,"tim":1490756854507,"time":1490756854,"md5":"GgW4q9QprOjPjTAfImooWw==","fsize":13407,"resto":0,"id":"2WutUT7H","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"how-do-we-dispel-of-this-notion-pol","country_name":"United States","replies":62,"images":18,"omitted_posts":57,"omitted_images":17},{"no":118747285,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)00:34:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118746770\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118746770<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;the fall of the roman empire had nothing to do with millions of barbarians<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;cannot refute points so ignores them<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;proceed with incoherent rambling<\/span><br><br>Additionally you realise the dark ages started in the mid 5th century and the Arab conquest didn&#039;t really start until the mid 8th century.

The next year the president was literally begging for the whites to come back because they didn&#039;t have enough sustainable farms, the blacks just couldn&#039;t do it on their own even in fucking Africa. Besides the blacks are getting bitch slapped by the Hispanics, they run Compton now.<br><br> Just so you know there will come a time when the whites realize what&#039;s happening, it&#039;s already started and we will work with the Japanese or do it on our own and we will segregate ourselves on ice land creating a utopia well the rest of you blacks Tear yourself apart and create nothing.","filename":"IMG_1210","ext":".png","w":500,"h":500,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490762729757,"time":1490762729,"md5":"zhg6yabVXD1e1XnHSPkUcA==","fsize":231564,"resto":118742988,"id":"dMACws5I","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118749284,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)00:55:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118746394\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118746394<\/a><br>Park meadows is still Lilly white, I absolutly love it there.

This is apparently based on a 24-hour working day using the above figures, as it cites the capacity of Krema II as 1440. See a photograph of the document, or Pressac, Auschwitz: Technique and Operation of the Gas Chambers, 1989, p. 247. There is argument among historians and technical experts as to whether this represents a theoretical maximum that was never reached in reality except with the aid of additional cremation done in burning pits, or a figure that was reached and possibly exceeded during the worst of the extermination action. Nevertheless, it is clear that Lagace&#039;s claim of 184 bodies daily (Lenski, Robert, The Holocaust on Trial, 1990, p. 252) is not even within an order of magnitude of being correct.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Nobody claims that six million bodies were incinerated. Behind the Eastern front, people were simply shot and buried in mass graves.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Many millions of bodies, however, were incinerated (including some that were buried in mass graves and had to be exhumed). It is quite easy to get rid of ash. It was dumped in fields and in rivers. Ash is not toxic; it can be dumped anywhere. In fact, it makes good fertilizer, and it is well-documented that farmers around Auschwitz used human ash in their fields.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Just compute how many shoeboxes fit into a large truck. Tens of thousands. What&#039;s the problem with dumping truckload after truckload into rivers or fields? Auschwitz is built at a junction of rivers, with a large marsh nearby. In fact, one aerial photograph taken during the war shows large quantities of what may be human ash in a marsh just outside the extermination camp facility.<\/span>","time":1490762570,"resto":118720645,"id":"QA1\/JvrJ","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118748498,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)00:47:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118747448\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118747448<\/a><br>Re. the construction date:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Looking at theoretical numbers can be instructive, if one remembers that the theoretical capacity was never reached for a number of reasons. But, if one wants to consider what the theoretical numbers could have been, using a hypothetical 100% duty cycle and no downtime due to maintenance, the numbers are staggering.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;We needn&#039;t look at all Nazi camps; let&#039;s consider Auschwitz-Birkenau alone. In fact, let&#039;s consider only the two largest crematory facilities (out of five). Those two ovens alone, working at their full estimated capacity 24 hours a day from their installation in April 1943 to their decommissioning in November 1944, could have incinerated over 1.7 million corpses.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;This is simple arithmetic, based on the furnace capacity that the Nazis themselves estimated. See a photograph of the document, or Pressac, Auschwitz: Technique and Operation, 1989, p. 247.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Note that the Nazis later began to realize that the theoretical capacity of the ovens was too impractical, and in late 1942 reduced their estimates from 1440 per Krema per day to 800 (see Gutman et al., Anatomy of the Auschwitz Death Camp, 1994, p. 212). Using that more-accurate figure, not quite a million corpses could be incinerated, in those 20 months, by those two Auschwitz crematoria.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;This corresponds with reality, since there were other Kremas available to incinerate corpses, and since we know that the ovens were often overburdened by the sheer number of corpses, requiring bodies to be burned in open pits. See question 41. In total, 1.1 million to 1.5 million people were killed at Auschwitz and their bodies incinerated.<\/span>","time":1490762837,"resto":118720645,"id":"QA1\/JvrJ","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118748815,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)00:50:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118736810\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118736810<\/a><br>You&#039;re outright lying.

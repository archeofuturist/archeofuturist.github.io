Growing regionally from its North East base, Greggs began to acquire other regional bakery chains across the rest of the country from the 1970s onwards. By the 1990s, it was the largest bakery chain in the country after acquiring its major rival, Bakers Oven, in 1994. In 2017 the chain had 1,764 outlets, including 143 franchised outlets.

Let me tell you something then. I&#039;ve been in the Albanian Army for the last 20 years since i first joined in 1996. I had to learn so much about the history of Kosovo, Albania, Serbia and the Ottoman Empire i wish i wouldn&#039;t have learned some things. What we are talking here about is not us taking away half of your country, i couldn&#039;t give the least of who gets Kosovo. But don&#039;t think even for a second that you&#039;d get away with any sort of attacks on the Kosovo population. What you would be doing would be violation of the UN article 1244, as well as of the constitution of the Republic of Serbia. Due to the fact the Serbian constitution recognized Kosovo as it&#039;s own territory and not a separate entity, any attempt at removing the private property of legally it&#039;s own citizen through force would be illegal and would call for international intervention. Even if America stopped backing us up, with an attack you would be signing your own death penalty, because your government would be, again, ATTACKING LEGAL CITIZEN OF THE REPUBLIC OF SERBIA. The only reason you, and we, got away with what we did in the Ottoman Empire was because things like the UN and the human rights committees didn&#039;t exist. <br><br>You have cornered yourselves and many of you are unable to see this, because if you did you would revolt against your own

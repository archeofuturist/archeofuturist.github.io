Should i stop writing and go kill someone now ? Science is about producing propositions, testing them and release to public. The only thing that matters are the facts, the explanation and the tests. And not how long someone has study in this field. Therefore it should be possible for any person to read and test for himself. and if the person sees a flaw in the proposition and\/ or testes point that out. The problem for me is called projection. We desperately need to find human like thought in other stuff, but sometime there is none. This explains why we look for ayy lmaos, and why are old ladies treating their dogs like literal children. They are animals behaving by conditioning mixed with pack behaviour stated by their DNA. Sorry but dogs do not love, that is just our projection. I do that myself i own a dog and its even therapeutic to project that way, its easyer when they never say no.","filename":"babyDog","ext":".jpg","w":597,"h":590,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":123,"tim":1492873322816,"time":1492873322,"md5":"MGd4VF\/rM0GxIYPvFnApeQ==","fsize":118288,"resto":122281073,"id":"zHidckOs","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":122285664,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)11:03:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122281073\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122281073<\/a><br>If dolphins are so smart how come they wuz never kangs?","time":1492873393,"resto":122281073,"id":"hhNvqrA2","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122285889,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)11:05:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122281220\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122281220<\/a><br><a href=\"#p122282450\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122282450<\/a><br><a href=\"#p122282102\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122282102<\/a>","filename":"klghj56j7","ext":".jpg","w":873,"h":960,"tn_w":113,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492873524327,"time":1492873524,"md5":"kFHiAGZmRxg4PllNutyqhA==","fsize":109142,"resto":122281073,"id":"Cuy5zHlw","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122286687,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)11:12:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122285889\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122285889<\/a><br><a href=\"#p122281073\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122281073<\/a><br><br>thats fucking gross","time":1492873969,"resto":122281073,"id":"Kx6+vlld","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":122284850,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)10:55:40","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Just fucking lol at British &quot;justice&quot;","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Fraud taxpayer out of \u00a3300,000<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Spend 100K on sex trips to Thailand and playboy lifestyle<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Brag about it on Facebook<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Get caught<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Two and a half year sentence<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Will be a free man in less than 18 months<\/span><br><br>http:\/\/www.birminghammail.co.uk\/new<wbr>s\/midlands-news\/fraudster-spent-100<wbr>k-thailand-holidays-12926559<br><br>The joys of a living in a country with a cucked legal system.

They lack empathy, incapable of establishing a friendly relations on equal terms. Apart from Moscow and St Petersburg and some oil regions Russia is extremely poor and undeveloped - as the Russians are incapable of producing anything sophisticated almost the entire wealth of the country comes from it&#039;s natural resources. Except for the art and architecture directly derived either from the Greeks(all the Orthodox architecture they have horribly bastardized, icons) or Westerners(these fancy palaces in St. Petersburg) they barely have contributed to the culture at all. Considering a very large population their scientific contribution is utterly underwhelming, vastly inferior compared to the Western Slavs. Entire society is subjected to brainwashing propaganda blaming the Americans for everything, making them praise their Tsar Putin and support all the vicious acts of violence and terror. They can&#039;t even into geopolitics - Russia still pretends it&#039;s 19th century and the best way for the state to succeed is to be egoistic, xenophobic, expansive, imperialistic, overly-nationalistic and authoritarian.

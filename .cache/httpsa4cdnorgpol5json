No one is going to make me date them, or room with them, or start a business with them. However, I will probably have to deal with them in public and maybe work with them if I&#039;m unlucky. <br><br>I have never understood why there is racism against non-Muslim Asians, because my involuntary interactions with them have always been fine. They can be on the cheap side if they are fresh off the boat, but after a few years they are close to normal, even with broken English. I honestly prefer the company of a Vietnamese or Chinese person to a black Jamaican who speaks perfect English. Their personalities are too forward, so they rub me the wrong way. Even native born black Canadians piss me off, because they usually have low impulse control and big personalities. <br><br>I understand the role of the &quot;red pill&quot; and HBD in waking normies up, but the racism of our grandparents wasn&#039;t based on infographics. It was based on first hand experience, and ours should be too.","filename":"raceskulls","ext":".jpg","w":864,"h":240,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":69,"tim":1492156246603,"time":1492156246,"md5":"pt5UC6LHDZ5s7T8BNa9yXA==","fsize":115220,"resto":0,"id":"zfD7S30r","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"voluntary-vs-involuntary-interactions-and-racism","country_name":"Canada","replies":4,"images":1},{"no":121034976,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)03:54:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"You&#039;re not racist, you&#039;re behaviorist.","filename":"hflfsdjshj","ext":".png","w":729,"h":412,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1492156496421,"time":1492156496,"md5":"cUt7sbWBv2MWEzhfluDj\/A==","fsize":30574,"resto":121034648,"id":"Mj0+UMny","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121035138,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)03:57:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121034648\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121034648<\/a><br>muslim is not a race<br>arabs are often muslims, so just say you hate arabs","time":1492156625,"resto":121034648,"id":"C5bWKAqd","country":"RS","country_name":"Serbia"},{"no":121035286,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)03:59:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121035138\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121035138<\/a><br>We have different kinds of Muslims here.

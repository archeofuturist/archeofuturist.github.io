And any who do will never be used again because they will develop a reputation for being shit judges. A judge is simply an arbitrator, two parties will have to agree on which judge or private court will arbitrate their dispute, and if they cant agree then perhaps they will refer to the rules of their defense insurance agency if they share the services of the same one, or if they have different agencies then those agencies will negotiate an arbitration between each other on behalf of their customers, and it is in their interest to do so because of good business practices. Ultimately however if two parties cannot even come to an agreement either in the matter of which court to use or through their agencies, then they are free to settle their dispute between each other personally. They would have to do this voluntarily and on the property of someone who is ok with this, maybe even one of their properties. Because this would be voluntary, no insurance agency will touch the outcome or try to pursue any kind of claims, because no crime has been committed in the case of a voluntary duel for example, carried out on a volunteer&#039;s property (or their own property).","time":1491687668,"resto":120161342,"id":"56JxY7W4","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120187110,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)17:42:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120186811\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120186811<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;its also hot as fuck though<\/span><br>I know how chu feel!<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;it&#039;s scary to think about<\/span><br>Not so much.

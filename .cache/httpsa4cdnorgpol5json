It is cruel and brutal. This has given past systems of government a bad reputation. When most think of Monarchy today, they think of horrible tyranny, oppression, and the slavery of serfdom. They do not notice the differences between 12th century feudal monarchy and 17th century forms of monarchy.<br><br>But the details of specific forms of monarchy and empire aside, the main reason we have done so well in modern times is not due to some new, enlightened form of government and social progress, as Progressives would have us think. It is because of technology. Our governments today are actually LESS efficient at organizing us than in the past, but we get away with it all because of mass production and agricultural technology.<br><br>Consider the situation leading to the French Revolution, often seen as the archetype of the failure of Monarchy. The King felt threatened by his nobles. Instead of either better establishing himself, or having his position fall to a more worthy ruler from amongst the nobility, the weak king appealed to the common man, allying with the lower class against his noble class. This left him accountable to the peasantry. Then, when famine and other shortages occurred, the peasants had the moral authority and boldness to tear down the king and plunge the country into a decade of pointless bloodshed, which finally ended only when the country found a new and even more absolute monarch.<br><br>It would have been a very different story with modern agricultural technology. As would pretty much every other situation that caused Monarchies to become unstable and fail (as opposed to merely change hands to a different noble.)<br><br>There are examples of single families maintaining order and stability in their countries for centuries at a time.

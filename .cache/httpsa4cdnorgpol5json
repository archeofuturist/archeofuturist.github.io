In the end two French agents were shot (one in the foot and the other in the leg) and a third suffered a broken nose. The remaining two managed to escape on foot under the cover of darkness. The unharmed villagers confiscated computers, diving equipment, professional cameras, and even a parachute in the vehicle.

It is characterized by a number of psychiatric symptoms such as throwing yourself into the path of lorries driven by Muslims, asking Muslims to sexually assault you in a public, asking Muslims to shoot you in crowded places and asking Muslims to behead you underneath the Eiffel Tower.[1] Similar syndromes include Jerusalem syndrome whereby sufferers may constantly repeat false claims relating to fictional accounts of genocide [2] and Berlin syndrome whereby afflicted males may ask the nearest person of the same sex to repeatedly pleasure their wife. The condition is commonly viewed as a severe form of culture shock. It is particularly noted among Japanese travelers.<\/span>","filename":"jap","ext":".jpg","w":465,"h":465,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":249,"tim":1490396920181,"time":1490396920,"md5":"dYMtCnlRWg6s+LVozXtwnA==","fsize":27751,"resto":0,"id":"t49hmj+r","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"paris-syndrome","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":3,"images":0},{"no":118147961,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)19:09:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118147831\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118147831<\/a><br>Man, recently no one goes to paris...","time":1490396974,"resto":118147831,"id":"mLt8Tp4a","country":"JP","country_name":"Japan"},{"no":118148177,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)19:11:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118147831\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118147831<\/a><br>Japanese people have an atrocious understanding of other countries despite having internet access.","time":1490397069,"resto":118147831,"id":"XOifdSqH","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118148464,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)19:13:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"Think of it like you&#039;re a weeb, you want Japan to be like your animes<br>But then it&#039;s full of niggers","time":1490397203,"resto":118147831,"id":"wtFXMY6N","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118147364,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)19:05:02","name":"Anonymous","sub":"WTF is this protest in DC tomorrow?","com":"Are antifa or anti pol forces going to try to use this event to smear 4chan and \/pol\/ because of the extra research done into the Podesta emails?

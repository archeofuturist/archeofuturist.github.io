Price action naturally determines what needs to be made, when, how much, and where it needs to go. This allows producers to have incredibly limited knowledge of what their product is used for only that more or less people want it. The timber industry for example doesn&#039;t need to know how much wood should be allocated for making pencils it just sells it to whomever is willing to buy it, in the same stroke the rubber industry doesn&#039;t need to know anything about pencils either to sell rubber for erasers they just know based on market pricing that they should make more or less of a thing. Government invariably fucks this up and that&#039;s how you end up with food shortages like we saw in the Soviet Union or in Venezuela today.

Anyway, I walk up and say hello and tell him I&#039;m a huge fan... Nothing. No reaction. Doesn&#039;t say a word. He just sits there, staring right through me. Staring intensely, but with no emotion whatsoever. I begin to feel awkward, so I say &quot;sorry to disturb you&quot; and start to walk away but before I even get a chance to turn he just gets up suddenly and starts walking toward me, still making full eye contact. At first I thought he was going to try and barge into me or something, but at the last minute (like an inch away from me) he turns and heads toward the trash can. Then he starts dumping everything on his plate into it. One by one. Steak, broccoli, everything. He picks up each bit of food up, holds it high above the can and drops it. Some of it (the steak) didn&#039;t even make it into the trash because he wasn&#039;t looking at what she was doing. Finally his plate is empty and this is the part that really fucking weirded me out. He looks around to check no one (but me) is looking, then slides the plate under his jacket and walks out.

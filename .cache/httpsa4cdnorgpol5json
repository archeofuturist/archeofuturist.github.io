Let me tell you a story from my life.<br><br>Every summer I work somewhere full-time to finance my studies, a few years ago work at this company, heavy manual labor, only guys, good lads overall. There is this one guy, heavily into politics, insanely pro-worker rights and stuff, basically a fucking communist. Every break he would argue with someone or hold his communist speeches. Often talks about how shit Haider (a now dead prominent far right leader) was and how much he hates him.<br><br>Work there again last year, there is this other dude a few years older than me I got along with pretty well, talk to him about the things that changed here, as that guy is gearing up for one of his political rants again. I say to my workbro &quot;some things never really change tough&quot; he just responds with, &quot;let&#039;s just wait and listen&quot;. His rant starts out pretty similar, but as it goes one it takes quite a different direction, eventually it goes into far right territory and beyond to literally Hitler-tier talking points, nobody argues against it or even reacts, his whole rant ends with him screaming, in front of +30 or so people and in earshot of the boss, ...AND THAT&#039;S WHY WE NEED A NEW HITLER and what was even more disturbing was what happened then, normally nobody would react to his rants or some would argue against him for a bit, but now you could hear &quot;YES&quot; or &quot;THAT&#039;S RIGHT&quot; from the audience. Turn to workbro and ask, &quot;WTF happened here&quot;<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;mfw during all of this<\/span>","filename":"1448825446974","ext":".gif","w":298,"h":335,"tn_w":111,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490693467108,"time":1490693467,"md5":"dRl6jVLjc1nfM1KisIp8yw==","fsize":3924264,"resto":118628233,"id":"ougCO+cI","country":"AT","country_name":"Austria"},{"no":118632181,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)05:34:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118628233\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118628233<\/a><br><br>seattle doesn&#039;t even get that much money from the federal govt, virtue signalling on both sides","time":1490693671,"resto":118628233,"id":"8Hni77Y9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118632232,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)05:35:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118631157\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118631157<\/a><br>shit memes for shit posters. all you faggots belong in an oven.","time":1490693724,"resto":118628233,"id":"BMSSvAqa","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118620409,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)02:22:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"Who here dropped out of college?<br>How has your life been since you dropped?<br>Or did you fall for the college meme like many (((liberals))) did?","filename":"BDRtret4","ext":".png","w":1080,"h":720,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1490682146368,"time":1490682146,"md5":"PKbDtMtn1pAgvcGYjHicOQ==","fsize":1073497,"resto":0,"id":"8RCucR6x","country":"KR","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"who-here-dropped-out-of-college","country_name":"South Korea","replies":67,"images":7,"omitted_posts":62,"omitted_images":7},{"no":118631601,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)05:23:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118630743\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118630743<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;waseda<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;not U of Tokyo<\/span><br><br>pleb alarm","time":1490693039,"resto":118620409,"id":"X1Ik+oJv","country":"CH","country_name":"Switzerland"},{"no":118631606,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)05:24:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118631131\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118631131<\/a><br>ID might change because im on mobile now but its a pool repair job.","time":1490693046,"resto":118620409,"id":"X\/91+eCs","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118631686,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)05:25:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118620409\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118620409<\/a><br>Dawww look at da wittle kwitty","time":1490693138,"resto":118620409,"id":"\/sFdifuv","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118631787,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)05:27:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"I didn&#039;t even enter university as I have no idea what I want to do in life.<br><br>Instead I saved some money and decided to go travel to figure myself out.<br><br>Now I&#039;m sipping coffee in a swaggy coffee place in a southern Japanese city.

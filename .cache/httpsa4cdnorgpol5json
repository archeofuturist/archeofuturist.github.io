No way I&#039;m using that!&#039; Therefore, when it came in the mail two days later (thanks Prime!) and my husband installed it, I stood in the hall and informed him that I would still be using toilet paper thank you very much.

It was heaven. A bit startling at first, if you have never used a bidet, but I have never felt cleaner in my whole life! It also has been helpful to those of us who have hemorrhoids (THANKS CHILDBIRTH) because it is a bit gentle and less abrasive than toilet paper tends to be. We haven&#039;t bought toilet paper since we bought it (March, so, 4 months) and I haven&#039;t missed it a bit. My husband and I now fight over using the downstairs bathroom, because the upstairs bathroom is lacking the glorious invention that is the Luxe Neo 120. I should take off a star for wrecking my marriage, Luxe Bidet Neo 120! THANKS.<br><br>As for the bidet itself, it is easy peasy to install (according to my husband; I wouldn&#039;t know because I was having a toilet paper protest in the hall at the time of its installation) and simple to clean for the most part...the back (where it attaches to the toilet) is a bit more difficult to clean than your average, sad, greatly lacking, bidet-less toilet, but nothing major at all. The nozzle where the water shoots out is covered by a neat little &#039;sanitary shield&#039; which is a nice touch. To clean the nozzle itself you simply turn the &#039;self cleaning&#039; knob on the bidet controls and instead of squirting &#039;out&#039; it squirts down to rinse itself off.

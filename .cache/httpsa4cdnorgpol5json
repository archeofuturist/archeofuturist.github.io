I&#039;m asking you that to see if you can support your philosophical framework<br>2. I didn&#039;t claim to believe in objective morality, I just said that empiricism can&#039;t address it - but I do believe in objective moral for RATIONAL reasons. That is, not because of data, but because of logic. In the 17th century Europe was pretty split between rationalism and empiricism. Some believed that evidence alone was just and sufficient for addressing the world&#039;s most fundamental questions, others believed that reason alone was. The truth is usually somewhere in-between. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;If evidence points in a direction I will follow that evidence. Evidence cannot be good or bad, it is unbiased, cold hard fact. Following the evidence leads to the truth. The truth allows us to solve problems, by first realising what the problems are. Logic allows us to employ solutions to those problems.<\/span><br><br>no contentions there<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; I am aware that science isn&#039;t everything, and haven&#039;t claimed it to be.

You said &quot;empiricism first&quot;, but if empiricism can&#039;t address everything and can be set aside so other tools can be used, then something else comes before it, a desire to know more whether or not empiricism can be utilized to that end. This leaves room for theology and other kinds of metaphysical philosophy but if you teach your kids to be empiricists first and foremost then they will have a very hard time setting empiricism aside to discover truths that only reason or experience can uncover. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Like I&#039;ve been saying, one can both be moral and follow the evidence<\/span><br><br>But what cannot be a strict empiricist and believe in morality.","time":1492217761,"resto":121127943,"id":"2KU7brij","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121143376,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)20:57:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121142154\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121142154<\/a><br>I agree that you don&#039;t need to rich, but having to rely on welfare after having kids is a good way to ensure their lives will suck.","time":1492217822,"resto":121127943,"id":"2KU7brij","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121143430,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)20:57:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121129126\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121129126<\/a><br>move on, while you can still keep it civil and contribute to your kids life.<br><br>If you carry on regardless you will become a bitter useless twisted fuck.","time":1492217844,"resto":121127943,"id":"e4PSw4jA","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"}]},{"posts":[{"no":121098066,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)15:04:39","name":"Anonymous","sub":"\/POL\/ - COMMUNISM GENERAL","com":"Hello Comrades.

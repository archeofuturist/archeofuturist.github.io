If you have 20-30 short-term relationships, then sex becomes something that isn&#039;t related to being emotionally involved any deeper than lust. You fuck 20 people who you think are hot, but don&#039;t have anything in common with, and no long-term plans with, then that emotional link between you and sex becomes degraded. When you meet someone special, who you are attracted to beyond how big their boobs are, then sex is nothing more special than it was with that drunk 5\/10 when you were on the rebound. Your future wife is no more special to you in a sexual way than the worst looking, dirtiest slag you hooked up with. Fucked a hooker? Well then, she has as much sexual worth as the mother of your children.<br><br>Sex is important for long-term, close bonding in a meaningful relationship. Sex isn&#039;t separate from a good relationship, unless you treat it as such. Then it becomes nothing more than another activity, like playing football or eating a pizza. That is why sleeping with many people is bad; it takes a fun, exciting, important part of a relationship and downgrades it to a game of golf at the weekend with Eric from accounts. If you start degrading the importance of the foundations of marriage, then they become worthless, and so does marriage.<br><br>tl;dr - Being a slut isn&#039;t good. It&#039;s a globalist plot to undermine marriage.","time":1490696154,"resto":118632746,"id":"vguiwdUW","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118634972,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)06:23:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118634513\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118634513<\/a><br>There isn&#039;t a thing such slut shaming smart people will just ignore them","time":1490696593,"resto":118632746,"id":"gUtdze3J","country":"IT","country_name":"Italy"},{"no":118634979,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)06:23:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"Heads up, sweeties... a woman doesn&#039;t actually LIKE to be creampied.

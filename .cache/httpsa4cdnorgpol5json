Why?<br><br>- Why does the moon appear upside-down in the northern hemisphere compared to the southern hemisphere? And on its side at the equator?<br><br>- Why does the south pole experience several days without the sun rising (polar-night) during winter and several days of total daylight without the sun setting beneath the horizon during summer (polar-day)?<br><br>- Why from the equator do the stars directly overhead appear to travel in a straight line while stars to the North or South appear to travel in curved paths?<br><br>- How do you explain the Aurora Borealis and Aurora Australis?<br><br>- What about the Cavendish experiment? Does it not prove gravity exists?<br><br>Thanks.","filename":"995625_10153097224666079_5100027453164879955_n","ext":".jpg","w":368,"h":538,"tn_w":171,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493232704401,"time":1493232704,"md5":"YruhC+WqKEA8Jdlkx4omhw==","fsize":85368,"resto":0,"id":"O+ieAA6G","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"questions-for-flat-eathers","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":19,"images":4,"omitted_posts":14,"omitted_images":4},{"no":122923104,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)15:08:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122922914\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122922914<\/a><br>I&#039;m not bullshitting.","time":1493233684,"resto":122921064,"id":"O+ieAA6G","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122923168,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)15:08:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122922659\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122922659<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;2\/3rds people on \/pol\/ are complete idiots<\/span>","time":1493233713,"resto":122921064,"id":"qyp0H1cP","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":122923394,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)15:10:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122922910\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122922910<\/a>","filename":"candle","ext":".jpg","w":400,"h":224,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1493233816114,"time":1493233816,"md5":"m+Z54vcItTGcN+it8CTGEw==","fsize":4737,"resto":122921064,"id":"j3YH0Ddd","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":122923553,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)15:11:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122922659\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122922659<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;one person believing stupid shit is an idiot.

It doesn&#039;t get clearer than that mate.<br>I&#039;m 100% certain the Scots will be off within 5 years. I went to uni there (Aberdeen Uni) and have a lot of Scotch friends who were staunch &quot;no&quot; voters. Brexit changed everything, especially for the women. Of 7 mates, I know only 1 who isn&#039;t now up for ducking off. Nothing I could say to them. They were all Labour and will never vote Tory, no matter what. I was on the phone two nights ago and one of them was giving me shit over the 2 child cap, as if I was a rapist myself for voting Tory...<br>I&#039;ve done my homework and reckon the Tories will get 3 seats up there - even put 200 quid on it.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;inb4 plumber who went to uni<\/span><br>Yes, I am, but I also own the company.","time":1493234094,"resto":122917610,"id":"7jHpBPdc","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"}]}]}

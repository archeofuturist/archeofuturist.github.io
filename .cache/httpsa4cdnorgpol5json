The FRG, the GDR, and the united Germany all had\/have censorship laws that ban &quot;harmful ideas&quot; much like the Third Reich did. Obviously they don&#039;t enforce such laws with violence or threats like the Nazis did, but still the idea someone can be imprisoned for saying an opinion or showing an image related to politics is laughable to me.","time":1493274995,"resto":123001952,"id":"Gn8cbA+c","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123005838,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)02:37:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123002170\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123002170<\/a><br>Weimar republic reminds me of something","time":1493275048,"resto":123001952,"id":"1LY42kEN","country":"LV","country_name":"Latvia"},{"no":123005865,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)02:37:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123001952\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123001952<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;why did they burn them?<\/span><br><br>BECAUSE READING IS FOR FAGGOTS","filename":"reading is for faggots","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":500,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493275067752,"time":1493275067,"md5":"v4PYIr4wvuwyP6wfSwmrqQ==","fsize":139109,"resto":123001952,"id":"pIebWBMl","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":123006056,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)02:40:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123002037\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123002037<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;You hide information you&#039;re scared of.<\/span><br>Sort of like how Jews in Canada and Germany have had &quot;Holocaust denial&quot; outlawed?

Feminists aren&#039;t about equality today; they are about supremacy. They want to be the dominant power structure and act like the borg to swallow up everything they can. That&#039;s why feminists are &quot;intersectional&quot;. They can use minority groups as means to seek power. The fact that women make up the slim majority of the voting population also ensures that they can ratchet down on politicians. <br>2. Feminism places women in the position of victimhood in order to manipulate people. It makes men look evil and women look virtuous. This slanders men and allows them to exclude men from supposedly egalitarian spaces (courts, universities, etc).<br>3. Feminists are anti-individual-choice and largely interested in marxist ideals. This is because marxism allows them to force &quot;equality&quot; on men and destroying individualism allows them to control the narrative. We see this when women complain about the wage gap despite huge pushes for women in positions of power and in stem fields. <br>4. Feminists are toxic and don&#039;t think logically. They&#039;d have you believe that rape is an epidemic and enforce strict sex negative laws that only benefit women then simultaneously say that women are sexually repressed and need happy sex lives when men don&#039;t want to fuck them for fear of rape charges.<br>5. Feminists are eroding the family unit. They want the state to be the father and the mother to be coddled like a child, leaving children raised with no authority in their lives and no drive to seek betterment. This fucks society.","time":1493274976,"resto":123003325,"id":"X4aem5fb","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123006012,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)02:39:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123003325\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123003325<\/a><br><br>1.)

Learn to control your tone. Do NOT yell at her. If she consistently yells at you after you not yelling initially at the start of a conflict, cut it off immediately and leave. <br>2) ALWAYS be honest with your feelings, don&#039;t withhold them. Even if you explaining them makes you feel weak, you MUST communicate, also don&#039;t withhold the truth or your feelings even if you know it will hurt her. If she consistently doesn&#039;t listen or downplays your emotions, cut it off immediately and leave. <br>My recent experience, been dating a girl for 3 years now, engaged since October and getting married in September. We have 1 kid. Lived in 4 different houses together. I cheated on her once and lied about it for a year and gaslit her, we took a break before her reaching out to get back together after a month of no talking. She found out she was pregnant with my kid a few days before finding out I cheated. She&#039;s never cheated on me, and didn&#039;t run off with some guy when we broke up. She&#039;s always been completely honest, open, and loyal. Things are now just as good as before, we just hang out and enjoy each other. She cooks and I clean. We play video games together. Sex was at least once a week before having a kid, after having our son 4 months ago it&#039;s just been once because she&#039;s still healing from birthing. What I learned in my deep dark hole of regret is that things will be ok no matter what situation you&#039;re in.

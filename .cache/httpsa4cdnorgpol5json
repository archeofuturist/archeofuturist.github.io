Benjamin Franklin was a big supporter of the colonies printing their own money. . . In 1757, Franklin was sent to London to fight for colonial paper money. Called Colonial Scrip, the endeavor was successful, with notable exceptions. . . Officials of the Bank of England asked Franklin how he would account for the new-found prosperity of the colonies. With out hesitation he replied: \u201cThat is simple. In the colonies we issue our own money. It is ended Colonial Scrip. We issue it in proper proportion to the demands of trade and industry to make the products pass easily from the producers to the consumers . .. In this manner, creating for ourselves our own paper money, we control its purchasing power, and we have no interest to pay to no one.\u201d As a result, Parliament hurriedly passed the Currency Act of \u201d64.1115 prohibited colonial officials from issuing their own money and ordered them to pay all future taxes in gold or silver coins.&quot;","time":1491325769,"resto":119486354,"id":"HDj3WTKy","country":"DO","country_name":"Dominican Republic"},{"no":119490915,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)13:18:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119489524\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119489524<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;completely prohibited as it is monetary gain made through means other than work.<\/span><br><br>this is the ultimate redpill.","time":1491326337,"resto":119486354,"id":"cARI0oy+","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":119490973,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)13:19:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119489756\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119489756<\/a><br>The socialism aspect is more based on mantaining cohesive relations of the people, programs that encourage interaction between people of different generations ( children groups to help the local elderly, things of that nature).<br><br>There was nationalized mendicine, loans were given out to recently new wedded couples with no interest, and portions of the loan were forgiven for having children.

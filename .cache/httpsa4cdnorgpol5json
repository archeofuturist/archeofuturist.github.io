There&#039;s a medieval course for lack of a better word called trivium that shows how to argue and become a better thinker (at least in theory). Basically it is divided into 3 components: grammar, logic and rhetoric. You learn them in that order. First you learn definitions and order of speech. Then you learn how to use grammar to form sound arguments (logic). Then you apply rhetoric and figure out ways to convince people by presenting and saying it right.

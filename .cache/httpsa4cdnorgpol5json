If it was less about exchanges and mandates, more about fixing market failures and expanding medicaid, it would have worked much better. Obamacare is like the worst of both worlds, the worst of socialism and the worst of capitalism. There are all these market failures in healthcare, situations in which no business acting logically would serve people well, as to deny care is to increase profits, and then Obamacare basically subsidizes this broken market and &quot;doubles down&quot; on the market failure which is why premiums are going up 50% or more some years where before it was like 10-20% increases in a year (which was still bad... but not as bad) <br><br>Obamacare was a huge subsidy to the insurance industry. It literally gave them an excuse to raise premiums. So now you have 35 year old guy with a family, lets say two kids and he makes a good salary like $150,000 a year. He is now paying like $2500 or more a month for health insurance, plus all the deductables and co-pays and co-insurance which can be like a few hundred to a few thousand a year depending on how sick you were. So lets say $3500\/month for a family of 4 with moderate health problems (kid with asthma, wife with diabetes, whatever... nothing extreme like cancer) so $3500\/month over the year is $42000.","time":1492191017,"resto":121085308,"id":"2j75TBxC","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121088428,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)13:43:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121086873\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121086873<\/a><br>A public option would have fixed so much.","time":1492191786,"resto":121085308,"id":"BN6XEWw5","country":"BE","country_name":"Belgium"}]},{"posts":[{"no":121082812,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)12:55:29","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Mighty DPRK Air Force uses WORLD WAR ONE Bi-Planes","com":"North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un overseeing a special forces commando operation, state media said on April 13.

Nearly all western thought since the last war, certainly all &quot;progressive&quot; thought, has assumed tacitly that human beings desire nothing beyond ease, security, and avoidance of pain. In such a view of life there is no room, for instance, for patriotism and the military virtues. The Socialist who finds his children playing with soldiers is usually upset, but he is never able to think of a substitute for the tin soldiers; tin pacifists somehow won\u2019t do. Hitler, because in his own joyless mind he feels it with exceptional strength, knows that human beings don\u2019t only want comfort, safety, short working-hours, hygiene, birth-control and, in general, common sense; they also, at least intermittently, want struggle and self-sacrifice, not to mention drums, flag and loyalty-parades. However they may be as economic theories, Fascism and Nazism are psychologically far sounder than any hedonistic conception of life. The same is probably true of Stalin\u2019s militarised version of Socialism. All three of the great dictators have enhanced their power by imposing intolerable burdens on their peoples. Whereas Socialism, and even capitalism in a grudging way, have said to people &quot;I offer you a good time,&quot; Hitler has said to them &quot;I offer you struggle, danger and death,&quot; and as a result a whole nation flings itself at his feet. <br><br>--George Orwell","filename":"3706","ext":".jpg","w":179,"h":266,"tn_w":168,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492177945713,"time":1492177945,"md5":"bI3OesaMOlURs6dBpYDtKw==","fsize":19264,"resto":0,"id":"zN5Hzpx8","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"thoughts-on-this-quote","country_name":"United States","replies":90,"images":13,"omitted_posts":85,"omitted_images":11},{"no":121087114,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)13:32:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121062088\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121062088<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;I offer you struggle, danger and death,&quot;<\/span><br><br>and he kept the promise!","time":1492191144,"resto":121062088,"id":"J1I7tY7Z","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":121087341,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)13:34:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121064796\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121064796<\/a><br>Not true by the way","time":1492191261,"resto":121062088,"id":"g1GE552k","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121087803,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)13:38:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121081263\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121081263<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Yes I am sure the CIA, who was at the same time engaged in anti-left wars the world over, would have totally supported these people<\/span><br>They did support them.

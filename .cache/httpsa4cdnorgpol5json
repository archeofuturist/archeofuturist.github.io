The borders of the old European kingdoms were always based on money and power. Every ethnicity in Europe has at least some history of being ruled by a monarch of a foreign stock, sometimes for many centuries. Jews were always in an elite position due to their roll as moneylenders to these monarchs.<br><br>When the monarchies fell, what replaced them was no more ethno-nationalist than before. Napoleon officially enfranchised the Jews and hoped to do the same to North Africans. The Soviet Union established designated homelands inside its borders for countless non-white peoples. The United States fought a bloody war just so that African slaves could become citizens.<br><br>And if you think flooding us with foreigners is anything new or existentially threatening, it isn&#039;t. It&#039;s exactly the same shit as when Byzantium allied with the Mongols, when the English established plantations in Ireland, or when the Habsburgs tried to replace the German element in Austria with Slavs. These neat white homogenous societies we&#039;ve seen in the 20th century are an aberration. The natural order of the world isn&#039;t borderless per se, but a convoluted network of warlords and plutocrats.<br><br>This is nothing new, nothing we haven&#039;t seen before at all in fact.","time":1491426836,"resto":119650692,"id":"Yw2z5mD8","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119657843,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)17:22:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119656905\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119656905<\/a><br>I like your style.

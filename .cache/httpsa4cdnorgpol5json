Quite well really, my nation may have slowly become less and less relevant the past few years, although its made a comeback in the recent one. for there are some things you simply will never be able to achieve. for instance you will never own as much land as we did, like really own. no longer will the world stand for a power taking over as much territory, it would be Vietnam all over again.<br><br>You may have a large military but never will you eclipse your enemies like the Empire once did, even we have nukes sweetie.<br><br>And never will you unite the world like the Empire did, never will you play such a role in Human history like the Empire did. bringing civilization to all corners of the globe. <br><br>So no, i dont want to be American, i have never wanted to be American and i believe the gains of my nation and my Empire far outweigh yours. Although Son, I&#039;m proud of you, you&#039;ve made great strides to further us a s a species, keep it up and you may be a great as us one day.

Also, please do not leak this one to the press (looking at you, Kevin) this time.","filename":"MakeAmericaGenderdAgain!!","ext":".png","w":2800,"h":2036,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":181,"tim":1493563648938,"time":1493563648,"md5":"hQeIJ3KoeWuNqoXfHOklwg==","fsize":3749255,"resto":0,"id":"5UbZZWb3","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"tgg-two-gender-general-western-god-is-an-anagram","country_name":"United States","replies":6,"images":5,"omitted_posts":1,"omitted_images":0},{"no":123484607,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)10:49:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"Credit to anons who made this pic and the ones that follow","filename":"1493548215673","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":720,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1493563783242,"time":1493563783,"md5":"vVCJxGwN8XuP4xULg0QxSg==","fsize":414307,"resto":123484387,"id":"5UbZZWb3","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":123484643,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)10:50:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123484607\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123484607<\/a>","filename":"1493548303591","ext":".jpg","w":1276,"h":1200,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":117,"tim":1493563806219,"time":1493563806,"md5":"s6YrmybV2RJ0TGdwk\/H58Q==","fsize":234724,"resto":123484387,"id":"5UbZZWb3","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":123484689,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)10:50:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123484607\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123484607<\/a><br>And again","filename":"1493548365619","ext":".jpg","w":564,"h":564,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":124,"tim":1493563842352,"time":1493563842,"md5":"HyUOIIXWTibmxKYUsPpFKQ==","fsize":61495,"resto":123484387,"id":"5UbZZWb3","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123484738,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)10:51:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123484607\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123484607<\/a><br>\/ourgirl\/","filename":"1493548945645","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":415,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":103,"tim":1493563871015,"time":1493563871,"md5":"A9u\/PpBHg+pqCa0EPnUcDA==","fsize":267455,"resto":123484387,"id":"5UbZZWb3","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123486719,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)11:12:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123484387\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123484387<\/a><br>i love this place","time":1493565175,"resto":123484387,"id":"WtNvkazx","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"}]},{"posts":[{"no":123449617,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)03:04:35","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Red pill me on Australians","com":"I wish to know all the info you have about Australians and your opinions on them","filename":"download","ext":".png","w":247,"h":204,"tn_w":247,"tn_h":204,"tim":1493535875408,"time":1493535875,"md5":"AtFX0bCBZ3N9U+caOPyUvA==","fsize":6599,"resto":0,"id":"Mm4w4l1M","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"red-pill-me-on-australians","country_name":"United States","replies":250,"images":35,"omitted_posts":245,"omitted_images":33,"tail_size":50},{"no":123485319,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)10:57:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123449765\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123449765<\/a><br>f u c k o f f w e &#039; r e f u l l","time":1493564262,"resto":123449617,"id":"XcVvXMFs","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":123485670,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)11:01:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123449765\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123449765<\/a><br>FUCK OFF WE&#039;RE FULL","time":1493564487,"resto":123449617,"id":"8hGtldMm","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":123486271,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)11:08:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123449765\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123449765<\/a><br>FUCK OFF WE&#039;RE FULL CUNT","time":1493564880,"resto":123449617,"id":"gsRgDngM","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":123486641,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)11:11:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;be australian<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;noguns<\/span>","filename":"gimme my gun back you commie cunt","ext":".jpg","w":730,"h":676,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":115,"tim":1493565111466,"time":1493565111,"md5":"nmha1rBG\/ArAdq\/3WPH6rw==","fsize":163402,"resto":123449617,"id":"dNR4emd2","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":123486712,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)11:12:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123482019\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123482019<\/a><br>Is it just me or is everyone on \/pol\/ 1% Jewish?","time":1493565167,"resto":123449617,"id":"dNR4emd2","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"}]},{"posts":[{"no":123457808,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)04:45:47","name":"Anonymous","sub":"plz respond Antifags","com":"Serious question for all the Antifa faggots shitting up the place, why are you guys all so fucking stupid and ineffective?

These things that people &#039;love&#039; to indulge in making them feel good for a short while manages to control the masses by giving them pleasure, they become brain dead and ignorant wanting nothing more than to feel good again and follow that.","filename":"aldous_huxley","ext":".jpg","w":1501,"h":900,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":149,"tim":1493557476499,"time":1493557476,"md5":"NQIkiKAarX5h+1LVQ7gsww==","fsize":743348,"resto":0,"id":"txWHZXfZ","country":"IS","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"huxley-was-right-wasnt-he","country_name":"Iceland","replies":101,"images":14,"omitted_posts":96,"omitted_images":13,"tail_size":50},{"no":123486532,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)11:10:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123475492\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123475492<\/a><br>I think Clockwork Orange rings the most true of all dystopian novels, because the west today is all about pathologizing people, sick or healthy, phobic or philiac, without moral or biological consideration because the state and academia is itself at odds with nature.","time":1493565049,"resto":123475492,"id":"b8gS5P\/j","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":123486579,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)11:11:18","name":"666 Jewred \u0279\u01ddu\u0265sn\u029e 999","com":"<a href=\"#p123475492\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123475492<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;the truth<\/span><br>you&#039;re too lowly to know &quot;the truth&quot;, pismire... so stop arrogating some divine to right to know whatever -- you&#039;re lucky to even be able to fritter away the inutile existence you have, such that it is","filename":"orwell&#039;s_2017","ext":".jpg","w":894,"h":666,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1493565078094,"time":1493565078,"md5":"uZzXZA53oejLTY+56tlJmQ==","fsize":121191,"resto":123475492,"id":"BJgMlapT","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":123486599,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)11:11:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123486478\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123486478<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;shawdow run<\/span><br>How is anything in it like our world<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Elysium<\/span><br>How at all?","time":1493565087,"resto":123475492,"id":"OoV+Vz8k","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123486683,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)11:12:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123486068\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123486068<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Brave new world was a Utopia tho<\/span><br>Probably bait but sure, I already live in Iceland so it is arguably a utopia for me but I would not want to live anywhere else in that world, I would just end up like John.

No one is morally, socially or economically obligated to accept an indefinite amount of refugees into their home. I know this is an obvious statement but perhaps rather than intervening in foreign affairs and destabilizing already rattled nations, the nations should flourish and evolve on their own. Providing extrinsic aide further exacerbates the situation as it doesn&#039;t address the issue directly, only the consequences of the current affairs. Why do you think at national parks there are signs that stipulate you should not feed the wild animals? A few problems will arise from this: they begin to become comfortable around humans and infiltrate sites with no care, but most importantly they&#039;ll become dependent on the outside food source which would disrupt the ecosystem immensely.

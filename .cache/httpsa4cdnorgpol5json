The resulting multi-lens system provides an opportunity to help correct aberration, a condition where lenses fail to bring all wavelengths of color to a single focal point, which in turn may facilitate higher quality imaging from smaller devices, researchers added.<br><br>The researchers developed the 3D lenses by blasting a light-sensitive material onto a glass substrate with a femtosecond laser, which has pulse durations shorter than 100 femtoseconds. The material then absorbed two photons that exposed it and crosslinked polymers within the material. The unexposed material was washed using a solvent, leaving the hardened, crosslinked polymer that will then serve as the optical element.<br><br>The resulting lens\u2019 diameter measures about 120 millionths of a meter, which makes it easily as small as a grain of table salt. The lenses can go from wide to narrow and may provide low to high image resolutions. Each of the lenses has a specific line of sight \u2013 clear at the center, blurry at the sides \u2013 capped by a curvature at the end. This mechanism mimics how the fovea, the small depression in the middle of the retina, collects light, and how the brain connects images from both eyes to come up with a single, distinct picture.","filename":"bre1","ext":".jpg","w":1084,"h":626,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":144,"tim":1490498345935,"time":1490498345,"md5":"XC6zDkcjKPwFMqlYjpudRQ==","fsize":72220,"resto":0,"id":"5bQNx5UM","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"its-over-niggers-the-jews-won","country_name":"United States","replies":139,"images":30,"omitted_posts":134,"omitted_images":30,"tail_size":50},{"no":118338876,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)04:29:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118313293\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118313293<\/a><br>High level security operative here. <br><br>I grant you, this is a natural conclusion to come to based on the current political climate and various intelligence networks in place but I will tell you simply why this won&#039;t work for 3 simple and not classified reasons.<br><br>1) Manpower. Let&#039;s make all numbers very round and very basic to avoid problems of nuance and to make calculations easy. Let&#039;s say there are exactly 7 billion people on the planet and we have this magical new means of surveillance on all of them. A single second for one of those people will capture between 15 and 90 still frames. There are 60 seconds to the minute, giving us between 900 and 5400 frames. There are 60 minutes to the hour, so 54000 to 324000 frames. 24 hours to the day, so 1296000 to 7776000 frames. So in the totality of a single person&#039;s day, some low level sub contracted entry position analyst with a degree and top secret clearance needs to sift through 7.7 million frames to see the exact second a perpetrator shoots a victim, or a general receives go codes to launch a pre-emptive strike against an ally nation. Now multiply that 7.7 million by 365 days and multiply that number by 7 billion people. Where are all the magical government analysts to monitor all of this ongoing information? Where is the office space to house the collection of super computers and cables and cooling equipment and monitors and desks and supplies and personnel that can remain fully operational AND discrete? Even if we could somehow make one analyst monitor the daily activities of 1000 people, how would they sift through all of the overload? What program could run the computational Armageddon every second of every day and make that information available in a methodology compatible with our spatial and visual abilities? Where would 7 million secret government agency operatives go to do such a job without calling attention to the job itself?","time":1490516979,"resto":118312846,"id":"7Zm5VgHJ","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118338911,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)04:30:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118313581\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118313581<\/a><br><a href=\"#p118321352\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118321352<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What is Quantum AI<\/span><br>Man you guys are dumb","time":1490517007,"resto":118312846,"id":"Z1ewkc\/U","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118338927,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)04:30:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118338876\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118338876<\/a><br>2) Cost.

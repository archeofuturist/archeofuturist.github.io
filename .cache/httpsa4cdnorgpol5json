But if that\u2019s not bad enough\u2014and it is\u2014here\u2019s the thing: the cheating I describe perpetuates two frauds. The first, of course, benefits the cheaters and their schools at both high school and university level. But the second perpetuates a much larger misconception: People really believe that our top high school students are taking ten-twelve AP courses during their high school year, maintaining 4.5 GPAs, and have the underlying knowledge one would expect from such study. But this almost certainly isn\u2019t true. And once you understand the reality, it\u2019s hard not to wonder about all the \u201cweeding out courses\u201d in organic chemistry and other brutal STEM college courses, the ones that Americans are abandoning in large numbers. The willingness to accept the cheating, to slap it on the wrist if that, is leading to lies that convince a lot of American kids that they aren\u2019t smart enough for tough courses because they don\u2019t cheat and aren\u2019t aware that others are.<\/span>","time":1490463860,"resto":118247838,"id":"EKpHD1EG","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118243393,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)12:50:02","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Mexicans deserve deportation","com":"If the wet backs in America are so proud to be mexican, why are they so afraid to get deported back there?","filename":"17021681_825452927593802_4531979537985567053_n","ext":".png","w":285,"h":432,"tn_w":164,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490460602564,"time":1490460602,"md5":"o4UalRrviixFESllHJLcgg==","fsize":215347,"resto":0,"id":"4VcpcJ79","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"mexicans-deserve-deportation","country_name":"United States","replies":20,"images":4,"omitted_posts":15,"omitted_images":3},{"no":118247312,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)13:26:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118247227\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118247227<\/a><br>Feels bad mang ;__;","time":1490462801,"resto":118243393,"id":"W0b1XFkk","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118248119,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)13:34:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118243393\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118243393<\/a><br>fat ass burger gringo, u.s use to be Mexico homesssss gringo, we taking it back for the motherland. <br><br>make america mexico again<br><br>viva la raza","time":1490463258,"resto":118243393,"id":"CONO0uuB","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118248318,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)13:36:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118248119\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118248119<\/a><br>no, brown filth lost it, and it will stay in white hands forever<br>you can be poor and live here though, so long as you are legal and work to contribute taxes","time":1490463374,"resto":118243393,"id":"81gvMg2X","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118248490,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)13:38:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118248318\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118248318<\/a><br>we taking it back gringo. after we take it back when Mexico is restore to it&#039;s former glory we going go to Canada next gringo.","time":1490463481,"resto":118243393,"id":"CONO0uuB","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118249078,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)13:42:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118247170\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118247170<\/a><br>Because of Operation Wetback.

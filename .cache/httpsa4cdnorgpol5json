The best thing you can do is encourage a clusterfuck of competing interests to distract the people in control for the term and worry about local politics. The only thing that will solve the problem is fragmentation so that people finally realize that giving centralized control to one person or one group will always work in favor moneyed internationalists.","time":1492083722,"resto":120898129,"id":"vl4k\/cHB","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":120893950,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)06:17:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"\/wsg\/thread\/1623239#p1638163\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;&gt;\/wsg\/1638163<\/a><br><br>Is this what \/pol\/ looks like?","filename":"pol","ext":".png","w":515,"h":547,"tn_w":235,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492078624986,"time":1492078624,"md5":"lJIAiYMD+8M6SsHGW1naVw==","fsize":512037,"resto":0,"id":"oNXsfZNi","country":"AU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"wsg1638163","country_name":"Australia","replies":19,"images":6,"omitted_posts":14,"omitted_images":5},{"no":120899873,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)07:36:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120895414\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120895414<\/a><br>this is just how americans look like desu <br>going to burgerland in 4 hours<br>and there are bunch of burgers on the airport all of them, mixed muts","time":1492083371,"resto":120893950,"id":"gEaXsAHK","country":"IS","country_name":"Iceland"},{"no":120899886,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)07:36:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120893950\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120893950<\/a><br>Pretty accurate I would say","time":1492083378,"resto":120893950,"id":"MJQbD6Sh","country":"AR","country_name":"Argentina"},{"no":120899989,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)07:37:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120895414\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120895414<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;using fucking NYC as an example<\/span><br>The place were it&#039;s like 10% Jews.","time":1492083465,"resto":120893950,"id":"fZ2yyl99","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120900006,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)07:37:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120899873\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120899873<\/a><br><a href=\"#p120899873\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120899873<\/a><br>Haha yes, very funny","time":1492083475,"resto":120893950,"id":"fZ2yyl99","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120900340,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)07:42:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120899873\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120899873<\/a><br><br>This.

In my personal opinion(I&#039;m an electrical engineer, not a military strategist), I believe the Hoover dam or diablo canyon nuclear plant has the highest likelihood to be hit on the western seaboard. If either are taken out millions would not only die because of the blast but any government institutions powered by such plants would be crippled. If Hoover dam is hit, radiation will be spread through the rivers even faster than by the wind. That is to say, if they didn&#039;t decide to do a high altitude detonation, causing an emp.

She predicted Donald Trump would become President and would use her Twitter account to relay what she claimed were messages from God that only enlightened human beings would be able to understand, one of them being that the past present and future are not sequences of events one after another but are actually all happening at the same time. Another was that there is an infinite number of universes in which every detail can be infinitely different. Also, she tried to kill herself in 2012 and claimed that she succeeded but that successfully killing yourself will only result in your consciousness being shifted into another universe in which you become another &quot;you&quot; who survived your own suicide attempt, but are still in the same life situation that you experienced before your attempt. Since then Tila claims to have developed a special relationship with God by which she can receive messages to share with the public. Interestingly, she does not claim to be God himself, but tells her fans to follow Jesus so as to dissuade a personality cult. She consistently criticizes (((Them))) in her videos and also claims that she has the power to alter our universe with her mind. Most importantly, she is now claiming the return of Jesus is imminent with the coming of a third world war.<br><br>Two videos for the intrigued:<br><br>&quot;A Recap on World War 3!

If white men were not allowed to vote, it is unlikely that the United Kingdom would be leaving the European Union, it is unlikely that Donald Trump would now be the President of the United States, and it is unlikely that the Democratic Alliance would now be governing four of South Africa&#039;s biggest cities.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;If white men no longer had the vote, the progressive cause would be strengthened. It would not be necessary to deny white men indefinitely \u2013 the denial of the vote to white men for 20 years (just less than a generation) would go some way to seeing a decline in the influence of reactionary and neo-liberal ideology in the world. The influence of reckless white males were one of the primary reasons that led to the Great Recession which began in 2008. This would also strike a blow against toxic white masculinity, one that is long needed.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;At the same time, a denial of the franchise to white men, could see a redistribution of global assets to their rightful owners. After all, white men have used the imposition of Western legal systems around the world to reinforce modern capitalism.

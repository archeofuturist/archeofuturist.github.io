Just think about the logistics of supplying enough coal\/wood to cremate millions, not to mention the fact that the ovens were all seperate instead of having one giant, far more efficient furnace. If the Germans were such horrible monsters, why did they build many small cremating ovens when the only reason to have them separate is so the ashes could be linked to the individual&#039;s body, and given to the family? The official narrative is obvious horseshit to anyone with more than two brain cells rubbing together, but it doesn&#039;t mean no jews died. Without a doubt some soldiers shot and beat some jews to death. However, the &quot;gas chambers&quot; and starvation can be explained rationally by realizing zyclon b is a delousing agent and the allies&#039; continual bombing of German supply convoys. The &quot;holocaust&quot; is allied propaganda, who pinned their own fuckup on the defeated Germans, just like in the first world war. Another reminder, all &quot;confessions&quot; they got from the Germans were acquired by torture and by threatening their families. There is not a single piece of evidence Hitler or anyone else in the German government ever meant to mass murder jews. The &quot;final solution&quot; often quoted talks about relocating jews to Madagascar or Palestine. In fact, the first coins produced by the Israeli government had the German National socialist eagle on them.","time":1493556078,"resto":123469523,"id":"0L\/u+D0f","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"}]},{"posts":[{"no":123473468,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)08:37:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"\/pol\/, I&#039;d like to hear your honest opinion.

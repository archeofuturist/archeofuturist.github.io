Really just a matter of presentation.<br><br>Dr. Michael Brown if you want to watch some debates of a jew blasting jews.<br><br>Ravi Zacharias if you want some more eloquence without necessarily abandoning intellect.

Watch one of his 1-2 hour presentations, and 1 or 2 of his debates. You&#039;ll have seen it all. It&#039;s good stuff, and honestly there is only ever so much that really needs to be said, so I can&#039;t fault the guy, but if you&#039;re hungry for more you&#039;re going to have to find someone else.<br><br>Gary Habermas. A few debates. Some good ones with Anthony Flew, where Flew was a better skeptic than modern nu-atheists, who are just cynics. One in particular you might want to check out, though less a debate, involved Habermas, Lenox, and Christopher Hitchens. It&#039;s probably about what you would expect, but interesting since Christopher couldn&#039;t lean on his typical emotional appeals, even though he tried. Out of his league, but the community accepted him gracefully.<br><br>Also of note, check out Craig&#039;s debate with Dr. Sean Carrol. Carrol isn&#039;t a nu-atheist, and by virtue of taking his opponents seriously, rather than deferring to mockery of emotional appeals, the debate was all the better for it. REALLY put Craig&#039;s understanding of the science and philosophy behind it to the test. Would love to see more stuff like this, but it seems to reveal more the philosophic anemia in academia that a professional theologian is standing pretty competently with the professional theoretical physicist in his own field. Carrol did a great job, though.

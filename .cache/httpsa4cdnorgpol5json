It seems to be split between Neo-Paganism and Christianity, both inherently Aryan Religions. The problem is there doesn&#039;t seem to be any common ground, which damages the united cause of the defense and preservation of our race. For a long time I didn&#039;t know which religion was right, I would have great spiritual experiences and deep though, that would only confuse me further, one area of a Religion I would totally agreed with, the other totally disagree, for instance Christianity&#039;s pure morality, something I found to be true, but It&#039;s insistence on humility and humbleness, illogical and stupid. Eventually I started to have deeper insights, I started to realize the men that created and shaped these religions over time were just like me, they only got small nuggets of truth, some more, some less. Some interpreted it more truthful, some misunderstood much of it. There was also an ability to interpret it in a good way or evil way, something Judaism has done. There is also subjective truths, truths that only apply to certain races or cultures at certain times or places, which is why something such as Islam is incompatible with Aryans but is with say, Negros and Arabs. I started to realize that religion is a guide, a guide for a race to succeed, spiritually and physically.<br><br><br>This is the ultimate truth \/pol\/ this is no one religion that is infallible and perfect while all others are false and evil.

Ontop of that I realized that currently Christianity is essential for our Race, perhaps not in the future, but until we have our own homeland and the Jewish menace has been solved, It will remain the base of our morality.","filename":"Screenshot (45)","ext":".png","w":1561,"h":878,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1492460464005,"time":1492460464,"md5":"DriXLsvNyNc24k4\/EPo49g==","fsize":1344920,"resto":0,"id":"3DJ\/ilhK","country":"AU","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"ive-noticed-there-seems-to-be-a-religious-war-on","country_name":"Australia","replies":147,"images":17,"omitted_posts":142,"omitted_images":16,"tail_size":50},{"no":121592418,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)18:21:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121591376\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121591376<\/a><br>Why these fags can&#039;t glean this on their own is astounding.

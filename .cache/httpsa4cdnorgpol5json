First of all you completely ignored what I said about maternity leave which is going to be one of the biggest causes that reduces degeneracy. If a female gets pregnant she&#039;s going to get fired from her job. That means either she doesn&#039;t fuck, she finds a husband to provide for her when this happens, or the whore starves. Any way you look at it its a win.<br><br>Also I think your completely ignoring the influence ally this government money going to colleges has on the economy. Without government money colleges will not be able to support so many people going there which means they are going to be forced to be much more selective with who goes which means our economy will once again be much more focused on skill based physical jobs, which men are naturally more adept at doing, which means women will be forced to find a man to provide for her or be forced to find a very low wage job along with choosing whether or not to go abstinent or get pregnant and starve.<br><br>Anyway even neglecting all of this men work overtime far more often and work much more efficiently then women in the office, and without all these programs getting women into stem it simply won&#039;t happen as much as right now and things will go back to 1950s levels.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;did I say that I, or anyone in the centrist economic position support quotas and loans<\/span><br>That&#039;s not even how those kinds of programs are enforced in the states, in fact quotas are illegal here in pretty sure. But mixed economy literally implies at the very least government loans. There&#039;s of course government enforcement of the economy through many other methods such as taxes, interest rates, tariffs, etc.<br><br>Also you talk about not wanting handouts yet talk about wanting the government to support homeless losers fuck off.

Without government handouts the niggers in the hood would literally starve. On top of that there would be no kind of push for diversity in the workforce. Also if you agree to cut off government hand outs (which wasn&#039;t clear since you talked about fucking shelters) then we no longer have to worry about waves of 3rd worlders. The reason they come to the west is literally just for the handouts. They would much prefer living in there own countries surrounded by their own people. Same goes for here in Anerica. Mexicans only come for the handouts. Without that they&#039;d be doing just as well back in there home country with their family and friends.<br><br>Also you talk about the elites as a problem but really the economy is too big for our own governments a majority of the time. Even if the richest 1000 men in the country came together their combined wealth would have little to no effect on the economy, not even mentioning there would now be unlimited competition too so if any of them at any point got inefficient his wealth would swiftly be taken away.<br><br>I have no problems with unions as long as they are private.

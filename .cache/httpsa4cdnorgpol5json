So they have to bribe outsiders to kill &quot;problem Jews&quot; like Christ. That&#039;s why the Jews fucking hate Christ and Christians. The bible is literally an expose on them. They hate Christ so much that illiterate Jews refused to sign &#039;x&#039; on Ellis island - signing &#039;o&#039; instead; a circle or &#039;kikel&#039; - leading to the term &#039;kike&#039;. Rabbinical schools to this day still won&#039;t use the traditional &quot;+&quot; sign because it too much resembles the christian cross, using &quot;\ufb29&quot; instead.","filename":"jewhistory","ext":".jpg","w":851,"h":391,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":57,"tim":1490245079816,"time":1490245079,"md5":"PZPT\/s4TrnQVRnh4uJZOjA==","fsize":160695,"resto":117871274,"id":"6uNs1yVy","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":117888279,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)00:40:36","name":"Fig","sub":"\/SIG\/ - Self-Improvement General","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;\/SIG\/ Discord Server <\/span><br>https:\/\/discord.gg\/MeXYAKe<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;This week&#039;s book club book<\/span><br>How to Win Friends and Influence People<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;This week&#039;s film club movies<\/span><br>The Wrestler<br><br>Read the #announcements channel for rules as well as info regarding the film and book clubs (reading\/watching schedule + discussion schedule)<br><br>ITT: Post about what kind of \/pol\/-related books you are reading and \/pol\/-related activities you are doing to help yourself live closer to the ideal of your political ideology.","filename":"1464676929412","ext":".jpg","w":1200,"h":800,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1490244036973,"time":1490244036,"md5":"Cfa9Dx4x2bUeW+GqbkO4TA==","fsize":356888,"resto":0,"id":"QVM6+i9W","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"sig-selfimprovement-general","trip":"!ABDCxTTFJ2","country_name":"United States","replies":15,"images":1,"omitted_posts":10,"omitted_images":0},{"no":117889358,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)00:50:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"I want to stop masturbating.

A 1-for-1. The Democrats, Comey, and everyone else know for a fact that Obama spied on Trump. The way they are trying to compensate for this is by blowing up the Russia story as much as they possibly can so that the general public is deceived into believing the spying was justified.<br><br>Overall, not even Comey wants to imprison a former President, it will completely destroy the Saint Obama narrative the news has been trying to run lately, and I&#039;m sure he&#039;s been convinced that it will overall look bad for the country and destroy the Democratic party as it will take a lot of people down around Obama as well. The Russia narrative was used as a bargaining chip.<br><br>So what will happen is that they will keep blowing up the Russia ties narrative to the point where it will look as if the spying was justified, even though every single thing the Dems and their propaganda arms have released has been debunked and had holes blown into by real investigative journalists, both BernieBro anti-corruption ones and Breitbart ones. <br><br>It will then come out that there was nothing found whatsoever to tie Trump to Russia and there&#039;s nothing to say that Russia actually meddled in the election, but because of all the &quot;smoke&quot; they&#039;ve been trying to show, it was A-OK that the Obama admin tapped Trump.<br><br>The Russia narrative is because the Democrat-controlled deep state wanted to go to war with Russia for a long time due to friction in Syria, the fact that Assad is still above dirt and breathing and Obama&#039;s JV team ISIS recently admitted defeat, and the fact that Iran is the next target on the list, a Russian ally. They wanted to prep the American people and indoctrinate them against Russia in case Russia does not stand for Iran being toppled and sends troops there to defend the country. <br><br>The deep state, for the next 4 years, will continue to attempt to paint Russia with a bad brush (cont&#039;d)","filename":"IovhWYs","ext":".jpg","w":634,"h":321,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":126,"tim":1490235626854,"time":1490235626,"md5":"hZaDGy7e2fSR1sOCXRzDVA==","fsize":58414,"resto":0,"id":"r7IJJqcK","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"1-for-1-analysis-for-the-past-few-weeksmonths-of","country_name":"United States","replies":40,"images":1,"omitted_posts":35,"omitted_images":1},{"no":117885882,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)00:18:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117874555\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117874555<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;7 country plan<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/9RC1Mepk_Sw<br><br>for anyone curious","time":1490242707,"resto":117871563,"id":"chzQ2LMY","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117886388,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)00:22:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117871563\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117871563<\/a><br>I hope Trump gets impeached. then the real war against the deep state can start.<br><br>Sins of the father.<br><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/dZAHk0g-Nfk","time":1490242975,"resto":117871563,"id":"LJbospce","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117887445,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)00:32:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117873666\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117873666<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;h-how do you know so much<\/span><br>are you a nigger? he knows nothing, he&#039;s just a cuck, look at this delusional cuckery &quot;if dems win we&#039;re going to war&quot; implying (((rex))) isn&#039;t doing his damnedest to start a war against asia within the next 2 years?<br><br>cucks are in denial because paul manafort was banking millions yearly from his russian interests (how nice of him to work for trump for free though!) and now he&#039;s in a FBI penthouse possibly at this very moment singing like a canary, providing that &quot;more than circumstantial&quot; evidence schiff has been squawking about. <br><br>everyone on that campaign staff knows it and are deep in desperate damage control, hoping with the help of right-wing MSM they can make a couple white house telephone recordings look like an all-out 24\/7 stakeout<br><br><a href=\"#p117871611\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117871611<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;$0.50 has been deposited in your account.<\/span>","time":1490243565,"resto":117871563,"id":"GxCzSxYn","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117888984,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)00:47:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"and that&#039;s the end of the thread, time to let this one slide eh shills?","time":1490244421,"resto":117871563,"id":"GxCzSxYn","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117890114,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)00:57:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"ok back to racebait and stale pasta then","time":1490245053,"resto":117871563,"id":"ET6H3IXp","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":117870633,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)22:13:38","name":"Anonymous","sub":"want me to go?","com":"my family escaped from turkey long ago due to the government&#039;s over islamic policies and occasional coups.

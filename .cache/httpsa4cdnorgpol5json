Also would Japan use the explanation of self defense to deploy the JSDF in combat roles?<br><br>While I know the weapons that the North uses are antiquated, I feel like it would be easier to hit Goyang and the surrounding area with artillery, and maybe even use smaller rockets (not the &quot;nuclear warhead carrying experimental ICBMs&quot;) to hit Seoul. To me, I feel if the war were to start, it would have to start quickly and with the element of surprise, by targeting or taking the border artillery positions directly north of Seoul and on the islands north of Incheon. Maybe this can be achieved by having a faux joint South Korea and American military exercise, most likely an air-force exercise so that the border artillery could be taken out quickly.<br>I also feel like taking Pyongyang early would be essential, to possibly metaphorically &quot;cut off the head of the snake.&quot; But I also wouldn&#039;t put it past Kim Jong-un to use whatever shoddy &quot;nuclear&quot; weapons he has on his own cities once they get occupied.<br><br>China and Russia would react in different ways I think. China would externally be against the invasion, but would also internally be relieved that they wouldn&#039;t have to deal with whatever annoyance North Korea has in store for the future. Russia on the other hand would probably disagree with the invasion, saying that peace was a possibility, and also would maybe even support the North Koreans with money or some kind of deal, basically to battle the American sphere of influence in the area. Japan on the other hand would deploy the JSDF in combat roles, because of immediate threats to their national security.

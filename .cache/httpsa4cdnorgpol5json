It is literally the solution to every climate change issue that we have.<br>1. It&#039;s exponentially more productive than Solar\/Wind energy, and it doesn&#039;t have limitations as to when it can be used (i.e. solar at night and turbines where the wind is shit)<br>2. The fuel is virtually infinite. The in-the-works multilateral fusion plant called &quot;ITER&quot; will be run on seawater. To give a brief explanation, the fusion uses a form of hydrogen called Deuterium, which is also sometimes called &quot;heavy water&quot;, and these little guys are everywhere in water. Fusion basically does the opposite of current nuclear power plants. Current plants smash neutrons into Uranium, causing it to split and release energy, while fusion pushes 2 hydrogen atoms into each other to form helium. Here&#039;s some more if you&#039;re interested: http:\/\/hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.ed<wbr>u\/hbase\/NucEne\/fusion.html, <br>3. It is 100% environmentally friendly, and there is very little to no radioactive waste produce. If there is, then the half-life is no more than 100 years, erasing the need for more deep storages in the Yucca Mountains.<br>4. It can&#039;t go kaboom. To be very frank, the fusion happens because of electromagnetism, and suspends the material in the air until it gets hotter than the surface of the sun, but when something goes wrong in the power grid, the magnets fail, which just causes the material to cool off in less than 5 seconds.<br><br>Nuclear fusion is literally the thing that makes the world move on into the Sci-Fi realm that everyone wants us to be in (Teleporters, flying cars, nobody wanting to kill someone, etc.). We need to push for this source of energy. Now, I will concede that this is not cheap, but just think about it.

Which is why it oversteps bounds in operations\/operating locations(FBI &amp; others have issues with them domestically &amp; others Internationally), tries to sabotage other agencies(such as the NSA) that are doing a better job then them, while making there own variants of the tech they have &amp; continues to be a perfect chess piece for Globalist interests.<br><br>The CIA has done so much shit, even it doesn&#039;t know how much shit it has done.

The Deep State has no problems with messing with the IC by doing &quot;Divide &amp; Conquer&quot; &amp; also they have access to all the tech the IC has.(So its not just the CIA who can leave &quot;hacker&quot; finger prints, crash things &amp; have a &quot;how many dicks can we see a day&quot; competition with the NSA). <br><br>You really got to give the Deep State credit for the fact that they were able to create &quot;perfect conditions&quot; to make the CIA rise in power to later be set up, cause the IC to have so many internal problems they are not a threat to them, but instead be tools for them &amp; have the IC\/CIA be more concerned about Wikileaks then the Deep State that wants to take over the IC and overthrow Trump &amp; the Globalists who want to do a Coup\/Civil War(Arab Spring\/Ukraine style) in the US.","filename":"Pyramidz","ext":".jpg","w":1000,"h":667,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1490052802225,"time":1490052802,"md5":"VJfTrDSEn1je8f7y\/rdkig==","fsize":162883,"resto":0,"id":"uq+t\/hmX","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"knowledge-bomb-spook-shenanigans-in-the-ic","trip":"!!9O2tecpDHQ6","country_name":"United States","replies":7,"images":2,"omitted_posts":2,"omitted_images":1},{"no":117550911,"now":"03\/20\/17(Mon)19:34:27","name":"Anonymous5","com":"Future topics I plan on covering:<br><br>1) GamerGate<br><br>2) Globalist Regions.<br><br>3) What would happen if Mecca was nuked.<br><br>4) Globalist Roles.","filename":"Pyramid","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":600,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490052867015,"time":1490052867,"md5":"Z7Rm4c8GlZgzPn\/nH3hYYA==","fsize":67046,"resto":117550757,"id":"uq+t\/hmX","country":"US","trip":"!!9O2tecpDHQ6","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117551398,"now":"03\/20\/17(Mon)19:37:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117550757\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117550757<\/a><br><br>fuck off with your shitty stupid threads nigger","time":1490053047,"resto":117550757,"id":"bMTEOO3V","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117551485,"now":"03\/20\/17(Mon)19:38:06","name":"Anonymous5","com":"<a href=\"#p117551398\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117551398<\/a><br><br>Shareblue you continue to fail.","time":1490053086,"resto":117550757,"id":"uq+t\/hmX","country":"US","trip":"!!9O2tecpDHQ6","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117551529,"now":"03\/20\/17(Mon)19:38:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"bump.<br><br>I like these threads. keep it up, KB dude.","filename":"1486686687518","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":768,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1490053100679,"time":1490053100,"md5":"WF17RyZnSThUMe1ZvwwEEQ==","fsize":346283,"resto":117550757,"id":"v6XZiPb7","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117551679,"now":"03\/20\/17(Mon)19:39:15","name":"Anonymous5","com":"<a href=\"#p117551529\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117551529<\/a><br><br>Appreciate it &amp; spread the word around \/pol\/","time":1490053155,"resto":117550757,"id":"uq+t\/hmX","country":"US","trip":"!!9O2tecpDHQ6","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":117543606,"now":"03\/20\/17(Mon)18:45:26","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Question to \/pol\/","com":"Do you think that the cia \/ nsa employees and subcontractors are aware of the pain and suffering that they cause to Americans and humanity as a whole?","filename":"CIA-NSA-SCUM","ext":".png","w":570,"h":566,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":248,"tim":1490049926413,"time":1490049926,"md5":"JPeVV69dXQCpK0DpK\/AYgQ==","fsize":506337,"resto":0,"id":"wA8WSt2m","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"question-to-pol","country_name":"United States","replies":16,"images":8,"omitted_posts":11,"omitted_images":5},{"no":117548953,"now":"03\/20\/17(Mon)19:20:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117548365\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117548365<\/a><br>The tale itself is completely disgusting, and real.

It&#039;s their land. If the Kingdom of Prussia can be divided because it contains Polish lands then the Kingdom of Bohemia can be divided because it contains German lands. What exactly should they have &#039;gone back to&#039;. That was their land, they had no obligation to leave. They &#039;chimped out&#039; because they were treated unfairly compared to the Czechs and this is supported by documentary evidence. Hitler&#039;s Revolution (Richard Tedor) explains this. The governments of Britain and France noted that Germans were being treated unfairly in Czechoslovakia (And Poland too but that&#039;s a different story) and were at that time sympathetic to the German cause because it was clear as day that they were second class citizens. And yeah, I didn&#039;t deny that Slovakia was a puppet state. Client state means the same as puppet state as far as I am concerned. Bohemia was not &#039;essentially annexed&#039; during the course of the entire war despite some provincial administrators wishing it to be so. Both Denmark and Bohemia were actually treated the best out of all German occupied countries during the war despite the Lidice Massacre. And you know what, I&#039;m sorry for those people but you shouldn&#039;t pretend the Czechs are guiltless. Don&#039;t be like the Polish who act like they dindu nuffin all the time. The Czechs ethnically cleansed the Germans from their native lands of centuries so they are not guiltless either. The Germans were like the Romans. You could keep your language and culture and traditions (Which is what happened in the Protektorat Bohmen und Mahren) but if you resisted or killed a German soldier then they&#039;d come down on you harder then when the Romans sacked Jerusalem. And lastly Denmark was a special case because the King retained his title and the government ran as per normal, they were only considered an occupied country in 1943 when things were going South. Otherwise Denmark was quite collaborationist even if they didn&#039;t like it.","time":1492261583,"resto":121188155,"id":"L2SEBrUS","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":121209804,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)09:23:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121193071\"

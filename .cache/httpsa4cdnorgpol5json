In two months when there&#039;s no war and we came out on top remember your faults, and I may forgive you. If not, me and my true bethren will throw you in the chamber with the rest of the subhuman kikes. Think about it. There is so much proof out there our Fuhrer acted on, and he has such a high track record, yet you faggots fucking left at the first sign of doubt just by one simple jewish trick. Nu-pol niggers get the fuck off my board. Us and Trump are in this together now, if Trump loses his support, we lose support for the future of American Fascism and have to start back at square 1. Don&#039;t be fucking niggers.","filename":"americanhero","ext":".jpg","w":300,"h":300,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491799202767,"time":1491799202,"md5":"DYmwy1eswq47Kq8gKuVMqw==","fsize":15477,"resto":0,"id":"dYbqWZkv","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"retards-on-this-thread-still-believe-assads","country_name":"United States","replies":18,"images":8,"omitted_posts":13,"omitted_images":7},{"no":120394376,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)00:49:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120393928\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120393928<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;implying im trying reverse psychology<\/span><br><br>No, im acknoledging Trump may not be perfect, but he is a tool in the battle for american fascism.

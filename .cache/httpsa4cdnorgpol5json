We can all agree that Western women are degenerate whores as a whole. Women who are used and abused and love non-white men. The influx of Middle Eastern men into Europe has seen a massive increase in rape and has also seen white women marrying all those &quot;sexy exotic arab men&quot;. We all also know that it&#039;s mostly men flooding into Europe, women like pic related are being left home. So here&#039;s my preposition \/pol\/, we let the arab men take europa. We let them breed with our women, who are worthless whores anyways. All white men flood into The Middle East and breed with the left behind arab women. Its a huge upgrade because our women are degenerate sluts and arab women are conservative and obedient and i have an arab woman fetish.","filename":"IMG_20170402_140800","ext":".jpg","w":894,"h":894,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491157088215,"time":1491157088,"md5":"oUUORXiaPvMNDfGkxovRrA==","fsize":130538,"resto":0,"id":"Z4Auiqi5","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"immigration-crisis","country_name":"United States","replies":3,"images":0},{"no":119227316,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)14:21:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119226947\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119226947<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;and i have an arab woman fetish.<\/span><br>Well at least your honest about why your making this thread.

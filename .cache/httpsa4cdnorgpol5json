In the USMC you have officers that work at company and battalion level, usually platoon level leadership is handled by enlisted marines (usually a Sgt or above, sometimes a Corporal). At the company level there is usually a company first sergeant (E8, sometimes E7) that acts kind of like the company commander&#039;s (usually O3 or O4, rarely O5) right hand man. At the battalion level you have the battalion commander (usually O6 or higher) and a battalion sgtmaj (usually E9, sometimes E8)","time":1490937964,"resto":118995195,"id":"U+EZ08bq","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":119024746,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)01:26:01","name":"Prismo","sub":"Red pill me me on sacrifices","com":"Is it possible that atrocities against humans on earth are merciful in a higher plane?

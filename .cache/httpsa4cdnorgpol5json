Todd Nickerson, from Tennessee, wants to encourage other paedophiles to seek help and support for their sexual inclinations. He claims paedophilia is better understood as a sexual orientation - although one he believes it is unethical to act on. The 43-year-old is a moderator on the online forum \u2018VirPed\u2019 - short for \u2018virtuous paedophiles\u2019, also sometimes called \u2018ethical paedophiles\u2019 or \u2018gold star paedophiles\u2019. The terms are used to describe those who have an attraction to prepubescent children but control their urges and refrain from watching child pornography or seeking sexual contact with minors. The VirPed forum has a few thousand users, according to Nickerson, although not all of them are active members, and the site acts as a resource &#039;to help virtuous paedophiles remain law-abiding&#039;.<\/span>","filename":"WTF","ext":".png","w":1261,"h":885,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":175,"tim":1493249469691,"time":1493249469,"md5":"GssfrQ1Xc+8\/LEMiRgGdTg==","fsize":1005413,"resto":0,"id":"tfDO8QAW","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"virtous-paedophilia","country_name":"United States","replies":16,"images":7,"omitted_posts":11,"omitted_images":6},{"no":122960758,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)19:54:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122959786\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122959786<\/a><br>de-stigmatisation so pedos are willing to get treatment is the first step on the road to mandatory child molestation for everyone","time":1493250876,"resto":122957922,"id":"xqA5WtnT","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":122960875,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)19:55:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122957922\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122957922<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Alex Jones<\/span><br>\/pol\/ said it first.

Then China responds with sending the few nukes they have after NATO allies\/U.S. cities. What are the chances that Russia, would also respond with nuclear force, against NATO\/U.S.? Russia isn&#039;t necessarily &quot;friends&quot; with NK but if they didn&#039;t respond in this situation they would lose their only powerful allies, and be left with just Syria and Iran. <br><br>It would seem that it&#039;d make more strategic sense for Putin to respond with his nukes, but then theirs the questions of: How many Russian nukes are fit for service? Is killing that many billions worth it? etc. I mean Russians, despite how I despise them, don&#039;t seem to want Nuclear Armageddon, or else the world would&#039;ve ended during the Cold War.","filename":"1454742584844","ext":".jpg","w":580,"h":434,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":187,"tim":1491735794846,"time":1491735794,"md5":"PfiBXkkLLnTCw4EQlTPCdA==","fsize":107129,"resto":0,"id":"25Um7a2P","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"so-if-kim-jong-un-tries-to-launch-a-nuke-at-say","country_name":"United States","replies":22,"images":3,"omitted_posts":17,"omitted_images":3},{"no":120277819,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)08:36:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120271287\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120271287<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;germany<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;military power<\/span><br><br>GYAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA","filename":"typical_Britfag","ext":".jpg","w":1600,"h":1040,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":81,"tim":1491741393806,"time":1491741393,"md5":"GhfCGAODwA\/J\/edST7wJYw==","fsize":530135,"resto":120270789,"id":"kgouD6tZ","country":"GB","m_img":1,"country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120277964,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)08:38:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120277049\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120277049<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Little fat man will never actually attack Seoul<\/span><br>You sure about that?

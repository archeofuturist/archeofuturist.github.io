Lately I&#039;ve been thinking of getting a therapist (hopefully one like Jordan) because i just get so nervous and clam up when i go to bars or stuff like that, but when im with friends im the most open person, might have been something that happened in my childhood where a girl humiliated me and rejected me, im just afraid of rejection, but its an irrational fear, and i know it, but i dont know how to associate and absorb that experience, how to slay that dragon and come out with the gold. Like the story that Jordan always tells about his nephew, his nightmares and the knight, the kid knows there is an issue, he goes to sleep with the sword and shield, but doesnt know what to do.","time":1490892120,"resto":118906622,"id":"WIo9GtAj","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}]}

I could offer some advice.<br><br>The best advice is to call a cab or a friend to come pick you up. But, sometimes that is just not possible or feasible. So, I might get shit on for encouraging this, which I&#039;m not, but here&#039;s some tips where you can make it home without killing yourself or someone else:<br><br>Most important: Realize that you&#039;re fucked up and cannot drive the same way as when you&#039;re sober. Your reaction time is longer, so take it real easy.<br><br>Try not to be noticed. The way to avoid getting noticed is to keep your speed down and don&#039;t change lanes. Stay in the right lane and keep your speed down. If there&#039;s someone in front of you, suck it up and don&#039;t try to pass.<br><br>If your not careful, you might wind up going over the speed limit and a cop will first pull you over for speeding and THEN will realize your plastered. Cruise control is the drunk driver&#039;s best friend.<br><br>Roll down the window and let cold air blast you in you face. It&#039;ll keep you awake.<br><br>Driving on a straight monotonous road might allow you to pass out behind the wheel. A curvy, but not too curvy road might keep your mind active enough to avoid passing out.<br><br>Choose a route less traveled. Less traffic means less chance of hitting someone or something. Cops also don&#039;t usually hang out on roads with little traffic.<br><br>If you&#039;re pulled over, you&#039;re probably fucked. But, if you keep it polite and try to pretend you sober, maybe the cop might just slap you a ticket for what he pulled you over for. Whatever you do don&#039;t mouth off. In fact, talk as little as possible. This actually happened to me, but that was before they really started cracking down on this shit.<br><br>Realize just how drunk you are. If you just can&#039;t make it home, pull over somewhere like a parking lot and sleep it off.","time":1492851350,"resto":122248672,"id":"n44DOy6D","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":122250971,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)03:31:26","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Islam destroyed Rome","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;be Rome<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;can&#039;t defeat Germanics<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;gradually absorb them into empire<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Germanics retain autonomy and protect borders<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Germanics love and adopt Roman civilization<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;western emperor is weak<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Germanics overthrow western emperor and pledge loyalty to eastern emperor<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Germanic carry on Roman civilization<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Roman civilization flourishing<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Muslims invade and conquer 2\/3 of Roman civilization, including the wealthiest parts of North Africa and the Levant <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Muslims cut off trade to Europe, depriving them of papyrus and food<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;dark ages begin in West<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Eastern part of empire continues for 1000 years until, it too, is conquered by Muslims <\/span><br><br>Know your history.

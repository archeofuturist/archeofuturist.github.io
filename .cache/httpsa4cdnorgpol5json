But due to shit going down around him, the rise of extremists in his country, a lot of personal attacks and shit overall going down he became incredibly paranoid and really jails political opposition and journalists which of course encourages them because this turns him more and more into a crazy dictator, while the people who back him still can&#039;t believe he is a bad guy<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Russia: Although Putin loves to appear as the sovereign leader supreme, Russia is struggling quite a lot especially economically, which of course makes Russians more and more discontent.

He just knows that, similar to Britain, there is a lot of nostalgia for the good old days when Russia was a threatning super power and tries to please them by appearing like a ruthless guy who has everything under control. The truth is he really appreciates the economic benefit he gets from cooperation with Europe and is much too afraid to start shit with it. America trying to paint him as the bad guy all the time is annoying him, so when Trump won and that bullshit stopped is welcomed by him but there really was no conspiracy that he explicitely tried to get Trump into office.

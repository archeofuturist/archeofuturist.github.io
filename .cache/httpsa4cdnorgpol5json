Christianity though initially having been based on a revelation by God has been thoroughly disproven. The bible is completely unreliable with the originals still unknown to this day. The quran however has been perfectly preserved since the beginning.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Are Islam&#039;s teachings and \/pol\/&#039;s views compatible?<\/span><br>Yes perfectly. Islam fights any form of degeneracy with an iron fist. No drugs, no alcohol, no feminism. Strong patriarchic family values. The sound of children&#039;s laughter has almost silenced in the west, Islam has the highest birthrate in the world.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Isn&#039;t it mysogynistic?<\/span><br>No. 3 women convert to Islam for every male convert. Women realise feminism is a false gospel and only when you find your purpose in life you can be truely happy. Yes Islam commands modesty but so did the west for millenia. People know start to realise that&#039;s the norm. It is time that \/pol\/ realises that too. The 4 wives you will have are a bonus.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Isn&#039;t it anti-nationalistic?<\/span><br>No. Islam commands us to respect all races and cultures and only cut out the blasphemous and degenerate aspects. That&#039;s why Islam in Indonesia differs greatly from say SA Islam. Obviously like christianity the religion itself hass no boundaries by country but it very well respects nations within. Without Islamic birth rates your race and nation will soon go extinct.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What about my christian heritage?<\/span><br>What about it? Constantinople has been under Islamic rule for nearly 600 years now and is still the center of so called &quot;orthodox&quot; christianity. Christian minorities in Palestine, Egypt, etc. have been under Islamic rule much longer. Islam commands us to protect christians and jews, even zoroastrians.","time":1493294205,"resto":123028202,"id":"EWakshWw","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":123028274,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)07:56:45","name":"Sage","com":"Sage","time":1493294205,"resto":123028202,"id":"3XU24EmE","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123028305,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)07:57:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Isn&#039;t it treason?<\/span><br>Treason to what?

Remind me what bible verse is the cause of the west&#039;s rejection of cousin marriage? Correct, it doesn&#039;t exist. In fact, many prophets of the old testament practiced it. God doesn&#039;t consider cousin marriage evil, that doesn&#039;t mean secular laws against it must not be uphold.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What about pedophilia?<\/span><br>Same thing.

All these events resulted in the deaths of both German and Polish civilians. The Polish Institute of National Remembrance found and confirmed 254 Lutheran victims, assumed to be German victims, and 86 Catholic victims, assumed to be Polish civilians, as well as 20 Polish soldiers. Approximately 600\u2013800 Polish hostages were shot in a mass execution in the aftermath of the fall of the city.<br><br>After the Germans took over the city, they killed 1200\u20133000 Polish civilians, as part of Operation Tannenberg. The event and place of execution became known as the Valley of Death.<br><br>Goebbels&#039; Propaganda Ministry heavily exploited the events to try to gain support in Germany for the invasion. Reports from the press and newsreels showed Polish violence against the German minority in Poland. Goebbels had initially estimated that 5,800 Germans had been killed during Bloody Sunday but in 1940 increased the estimate to 58,000 which was subsequently published in the pamphlet &quot;Polish Atrocities Against the German Minority in Poland&quot; which convinced most Germans for the invasion and fueled more hatred against the Poles.[14]<br><br>Hitler&#039;s secret decree of 4 October 1939 stated that all crimes committed by the Germans between 1 September 1939 and 4 October 1939 were not to be prosecuted.<br><br>So in this pamphlet made by Goebbels et consortes we have 58 000, how did that grow to 100 000 I don&#039;t know","time":1493704474,"resto":123730363,"id":"KK5j\/Aef","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":123734628,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)01:54:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123733474\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123733474<\/a><br>Because anglos were supporting the Soviets for years already, to bring about communist revolution across Europe.","time":1493704480,"resto":123730363,"id":"9rBvb4\/9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123734669,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)01:55:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123730363\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123730363<\/a><br>Hitler was a Luciferian globalist like the rest of them.

Overall they were still much weaker, but waiting any longer would see the balance of the power swing even further towards Russia&#039;s advantage.<br><br>In hindsight, taking into account the economic forces at work, Germany never stood a chance. Forget about stuff like not taking Moscow an Leningrad in 1941, losing the 6th army at Stalingrad, not attacking at Kursk earlier, an then all the other errors credited to Hitler, It makes little difference other than altering the length of the war by a year at most.

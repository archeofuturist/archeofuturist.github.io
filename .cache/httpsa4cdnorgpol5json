He was serving as president of the Istanbul Youth Group of Erbakan\u2019s National Salvation Party at the time. \u201cMas-Kom-Ya\u201d is a compound acronym for \u201cMasons-Communists-Yahudi\u201d \u2014 \u201cJews\u201d \u2014 and the play focused on the evil nature of these three, whose common denominator was Judaism. When Valley of the Wolves was released in Turkey in 2006, it became the most expensive film ever made in Turkey. The film included a \u201ccinematic motif\u201d which featured an American Jewish doctor dismembering Iraqis allegedly murdered by American soldiers in order to harvest their organs for Jewish markets. At the time, then-Prime Minister Erdogan not only failed to condemn the film, he justified its production and popularity. His wife, Emine, also attended a gala screening of the film and sat next to the movie\u2019s star.","filename":"1448588037719-0","ext":".jpg","w":460,"h":620,"tn_w":92,"tn_h":124,"tim":1492485006626,"time":1492485006,"md5":"Es5z6Y74WwhGbJaFZ35+lA==","fsize":108551,"resto":121626678,"id":"LRljLYT9","country":"TR","country_name":"Turkey"},{"no":121628986,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)23:11:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121628607\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121628607<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;because they have none?<\/span><br><br>Non-interventionism is a value.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;kek. whats your position on north korea?<\/span><br><br>You can&#039;t possibly compare the two; US tension with NK is caused by the possibility of obtaining nuclear weapons under a hostile regime.

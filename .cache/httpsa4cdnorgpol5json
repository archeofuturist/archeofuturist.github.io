Religious Jews tend to be right wing and pro gun. Secular Jews tend to be Left wing Marxists and anti gun. Since being cast out of Isreal 2000 years ago by the Romans, Jews have sought to maintain their cultural and racial identity by casting the rest of humanity as the enemy, the Goyim. Religious Jews at least recognize the U.S. for what it is, a haven where they are free to practice their religion and culture unimpeded. These Jews actually support the Constitution and the second amendment. They also support Is real, which is an albatross around America&#039;s neck, but that&#039;s another issue. Religious Jews maintain cultural and racial identity by strict adherence to their beliefs. To a point, the religious Jew is an ally of the Right, even against the Secular Jew. They are in the minority. The majority of Jews in the U.S. are secular Jews. Most rarely set foot in a Temple and, at best, merely go through the motions of being religious, if they bother at all. They maintain cultural identity by making enemies of everyone that isn&#039;t them. It isn&#039;t enough that the U.S. has offered Judaism the safest haven they have ever had. The Goyim might turn on them at any time, they must be disarmed and subjugated. So it becomes a kind of self fulfilling prophecy. The Secular Jew acts against others as though he is an enemy, even when the Got has given no indication that he is, or even wants to be. The Jew, encouraged by his success, becomes ever bolder until he finally elicits a response. The Goyim lashes back, at which point, the Secular Jew cries out that he is being persecuted and that his paranoid machinations against the Goyim were justified all along. This is an old story. The Jews have been driven from nearly every country they&#039;ve ever settled. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;If you meet an asshole in the morning, you met an asshole.

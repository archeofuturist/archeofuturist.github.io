We need some kind of intermediator to be in the front lines that both sides can respect and listen to. Maybe a group of ex marines that will tell antifa to go back down a few levels of violence and better not throw any bombs and also tell the shield banding blood thirsty right wingers to not charge in otherwise they&#039;ll get the boot as well. No right winger will try to attack our ex military and antifa will be too pussy to do anything with actually trained people. We have to lower it down and not turn into political gangs. Going on the defense is perfectly fine but the last battle that happened our guys charged in almost every time. If we continue to escalate into the offensive, they will retaliate with further escalated actions.","time":1492962875,"resto":122429555,"id":"LIGSwaxT","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122439745,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)11:55:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122434478\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122434478<\/a><br>Hes got a fucking gook girlfriend.

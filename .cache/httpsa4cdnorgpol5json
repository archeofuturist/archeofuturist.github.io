Missouri Compromise). The South were massively democratic, and being such staunchly opposed the Republican north, seeing as the republicans wanted to stop the expansion of slavery, and really it was kickstarted by Lincolns election. Seeing how Lincoln got little to no support in the south and if my memory serves him right he won no southern states. Southerners had already threatened to secede if he was elected. They also felt after the election that disunion was their only option, feeling they were losing representation and felt that their rights were being stomped on. Then when the southern states seceded and that in my opinion marks the start of civil war. I personally would argue that it was more about preservation of the union than the abolition of slavery, seeing how an independent south would add to increased tensions over trade, land right etc. Though I believe slavery played in important role. Seeing how much support Lincoln got from abolitionists, also we need not forget how Lincoln opposed slavery, even arguing that blacks should have the right to vote after the war during reconstruction, which coincidentally led to his assassination. So in summary it was more about states right in the south and preservation of the union in north.","time":1493789230,"resto":123869720,"id":"D8tRbfUb","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":123875621,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)01:16:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"Why are Finland and Eastern Europe less cucked than Western Europe?","filename":"Islam_in_Europe_by_Percentage","ext":".png","w":450,"h":609,"tn_w":184,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493788598135,"time":1493788598,"md5":"olaDYHTESpzoZCfE03CW0A==","fsize":18780,"resto":0,"id":"k7IWVXdI","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"why-are-finland-and-eastern-europe-less-cucked","country_name":"United States","replies":4,"images":0},{"no":123875971,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)01:20:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"They&#039;re poor.

So, I got on the beignet table and had to work and take care of the friar. <br>it&#039;s a sunday, which means we close at 12 instead of 2 am, and for once in my closing career, I was sober as a joke. No pot, no liquor, nothing. Of course it has to happen when I&#039;m in complete control of my mental faculties. So, in order to clean the fryer, you screw in a spout to the fryer release, turn that shit open and let the 350 degree grease pour into the filter, which then uses a pump and a spout to shoot the grease back into the fryer in order to break up all of the flour that sinks below the fryer grate to the bottom. SO the spout is a chewed-up, practically cross-threaded piece of shit, and APPARENTLY it didn&#039;t engage the threads on the fryer completely, which led to a drip of grease on the floor. Being the enterprising young lad that I was, I thought &quot;well damn that&#039;s gonna cause a lot more work and we&#039;re trying to get out of here by one, which aint gonna happen if I have to salt the grease spill and then clean it up&quot;. So, I went down with a rag to tighten the spout, COMPLETELY FUCKING FORGETTING RULE # 1 OF HOT GREASE, MAKE SURE IT CAN NEVER FLOW AT YOU. So while I tightened the spout, I forgot to shut off the grease flow. The spout canted in like half a second, I realized &quot;oh fuck shits about to get real&quot; and pulled my hand back. Spout shot off, still managed to catch part of my left hand with some 350 degree grease. Proceeded to swear loudly, got a bucket of icewater and salt, and soaked that shit on the side of the fryer while I finished cleaning the fryer and closing the kitchen. <br><br>TL;DR<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Made a mistake while sober that I never would have made while fucked up, forgot to shut off grease when attempting to tighten to tighten the spout, spout flew off and tagged my left hand with hot grease<\/span>","filename":"744","ext":".jpg","w":2448,"h":3264,"tn_w":93,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493789150227,"time":1493789150,"md5":"PLLmOOUkjnnlc\/OOZL3pVA==","fsize":1147049,"resto":123856600,"id":"mAw9IbG0","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":123876537,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)01:26:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123876323\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123876323<\/a><br><br>What school do you suggest other than BRCC?

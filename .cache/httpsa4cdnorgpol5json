But along comes one faggot who&#039;s actually a sleeper agent for the Chinese who goes to California and convinces the state to rebel and start killing Americans because of the gay marriage ban that literally wasn&#039;t enforced.<br><br>He murders the Californian governor and announces California is a sovereign nation. Now the US and China are both watching California so the US is forced to enforce the gay marriage ban so as to not tip their hand to China that they&#039;re about ready to declare war and that they&#039;re still playing along with the treaty. <br><br>The US then sends one contingent of the National Guard to put down this faggot&#039;s rebellion so the country isn&#039;t split and they&#039;re not fighting a war on two fronts when they get ready to invade China. All the faggots in the rebellion army who hate the gay-hating Chinese can rejoin the US military once the rebellion is done.<br><br>Does that analogy help you understand the situation a bit better?","time":1490651909,"resto":118533759,"id":"JP+z121+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118568595,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)18:01:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118533759\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118533759<\/a><br>kys nordcuck","filename":"1483595319011","ext":".png","w":900,"h":1339,"tn_w":84,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490652102324,"time":1490652102,"md5":"DbPsxLepP41oXeX8pBhcxw==","fsize":452814,"resto":118533759,"id":"ABMwNiH0","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":118568885,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)18:04:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118533759\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118533759<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Sturmcucks: barbaric snowchimps that dindu nuffin<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Empire: collapsing roman-esque empire that still built a civilization<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;not siding with the jap- i mean Thalmor masterrace<\/span>","filename":"mywifesson.jpg","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":375,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1490652251686,"time":1490652251,"md5":"IFSD8EWrvtUBwgLnL3HJkg==","fsize":42497,"resto":118533759,"id":"87p\/2oKH","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118569380,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)18:08:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118567630\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118567630<\/a><br>And if they showed up and said &quot;It&#039;s time&quot; the Stormcloaks would have been tickled pink and everyone would have had what they wanted.<br>Except the AD.<br><br>The Empire chose to act as the ADs land army in Skyrim instead.<br>It was nice of the Empire to do this because the AD army is getting ready to restart a war and couldn&#039;t spare the troops.<br><br>You are still not seeing it are you?","time":1490652499,"resto":118533759,"id":"2d5ZJgLB","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118569809,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)18:12:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118568248\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118568248<\/a><br>Does Cali have a hard on to go to war with China?<br>If they do then you go to war with China.<br><br>You don&#039;t kill half of the Californians then go to war.<br><br>Logic is not your strong suit is it?","time":1490652723,"resto":118533759,"id":"2d5ZJgLB","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}]}

There&#039;s a range of color codes used, with white being everything going well and black being a shit hitting the fan type of thing. I know this because my office was right across from the office of another guy who I didn&#039;t know very well, but I won&#039;t give out names. He handled some kind of planning, coordination, or something along those lines. He left his door open a lot and I overheard the color codes being used. Black was used when discussing things like terrorist attacks or movement of large amounts of weapons or extremely dangerous materials.

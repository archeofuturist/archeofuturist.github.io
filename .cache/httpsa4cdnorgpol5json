The repetitions depend on the capability of the Hitlerjungen. While exercising, there must always be the good feeling of &quot;tone&quot;. The Hitlerjunge may never feel exhaustion (headache, nausea, etc). if there is no medicine ball available, it may be replaced with a fitting ball of cloth, the sphere may be replaced with rocks.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The exercises with apparatus include exercises with the medicine ball, the sphere and the tree log. Other valuable exercises with kettlebells, dumbell, hammer and throwing weights will be ignored because of their price and their difficulty of application in halls and gymnastic grounds.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Medicine ball exercises<\/span><br>The text mainly just explains the pics.<br>1. Catching the ball<br>2. Throwing the medicine ball overhead and back<br>3. Catching and throwing the medicine ball overhead<br>4. Same, but bent over<br>5. Shot putting the medicine ball left and right<br>6. Anyhow throw the medicine ball<br>7. Throwing the medicine ball with a situp (you can youtube that, bros)<br>8. Throwing two or three medicine balls. Basically, throwing a ball with either hand.<br><br>Next are exercises with the sphere, no weight is given here either. Maybe it&#039;s the 5 kg shot put?

Take up the log and walk around with it.<br>2. Take a short log (2 meters long; 15-20 lbs); squat with it, then explose upwards, throw it overhead, then catch it again. You can also do this with the bigger log and by doing a split step like in Oly lifting.<br>3. Shot putting the short log (?). You hold it in position with the other hand, not sure I understand this right.<br>4. The Highland Games-like caber toss.<br><br>I think that&#039;s enough for me now lol.

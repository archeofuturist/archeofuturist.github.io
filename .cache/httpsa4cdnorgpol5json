It&#039;s a lovely church. I often just sit there and pray. Parts of it are over 1000 years old. <br>The doorway is from the Norman conquest.

The Apostles also had disciples of their own, one of whom we still have works from - Polycarp. Through them, we have a direct succession from the Apostles. This is all what is Church Tradition, literally the Orthodox Church. Differences in teachings, such as those of Arius, Gnostics, Iconoclasts, Monophysites, etc, were defended against through the centuries ultimately via the first 7 Ecumenical Councils, which have Biblical precedent in Acts (Council of Jerusalem). These didn&#039;t so much constrain Christianity as answer the heresies mentioned and clarify.. hence the Nicene Creed, for example. Orthodoxy tries to keep the &quot;aperture&quot; of Theology as open as it can without allowing heresy, so to say. Conversely, Protestants narrow the aperture as much as they can dogmatically so that their interpretation is the only correct one.","time":1491356026,"resto":119500695,"id":"s+42rtYb","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119549160,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)21:49:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119545017\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119545017<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;where?

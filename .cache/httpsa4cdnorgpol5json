Bank of Cyprus is a front for Putin and Russian Oligarchs via 10% ownership, Dimitry Rybolovlev and that its known to be where Russian Billionaires stash their money.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Rybolovlev purchased Maison de L&#039;Amitie from Trump for $95 million, after Trump paid $41 million for it four years earlier. To some this might seem like a savvy real estate deal \u2014 however, in the context of the vast money laundering schemes involving Deutsche Bank, Russian Billionaires, and New York Real Estate, followed by Trump&#039;s immediate repayment of a close-to-default $50 million dollar loan to Deutsche Bank, it looks like a money laundering scheme to get money out of Russia, and in to Trump&#039;s hands. At this point, Trump became inextricably compromised by Russia. This is why he won&#039;t release his tax returns - it will reveal the extent of his current liabilities and who owns them (hint: it&#039;s Russians)<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Rybolovlev also owns MKATE \u2014 a plane which made about 25-30 stops in bizarre airports around the US throughout the Presidential Campaign; suspicious since these are places a Russian billionaire has no business going and almost always overlapping with the presence of Trump&#039;s 757. The secret: it was for Michael Cohen to move in and out of the country without record of transit.

This general is for the discussion of Marxism-Leninism, the ideology of revolutionary socialism and communism.<br><br>Communism is the next stage of humanity following the capitalist stage.<br><br>What exactly is communism according to Marxist-Leninists:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Communism is a stage of society in which the productive infrastructure is socially owned, and goods are produced not in order to sell for profit, but in order to meet a social need.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Communism in it&#039;s full form is a stateless, classless society that follows the maxim &quot;From each according to their ability, to each according to their need.&quot;<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;To achieve such a society Marxism-Leninism teaches us that we must replace the capitalist state, which is controlled by the capitalist class, by a socialist state, which is controlled by the working class. Then, a period of class struggle follows in which the capitalist class is liquidated by the working class. When the capitalist class has been completely vanquished, there will be only one class, the working class, and eventually the functions of the state will become indistinguishable from the functions of the society as a whole, and the state as such will &#039;wither away&#039; as Marx said.<\/span><br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/ma<wbr>rx\/works\/1847\/11\/prin-com.htm<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/ma<wbr>rx\/works\/1848\/communist-manifesto\/<br><br>ML uses a philosophy called dialectical materialism, see here:<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/reference\/<wbr>archive\/stalin\/works\/1938\/09.htm<br><br>It is recommended that you read some of the critical works of Marxism-Leninism so you can make an informed assessment of the ideology.<br><br>Resources:<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/ma<wbr>rx\/works\/sw\/<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/le<wbr>nin\/works\/sw\/<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/reference\/<wbr>archive\/stalin\/works\/decades-index.<wbr>htm<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/reference\/<wbr>archive\/mao\/selected-works\/<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/ma<wbr>rx\/works\/1884\/origin-family\/<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/le<wbr>nin\/works\/1914\/mar\/11.htm","filename":"1480606481750","ext":".png","w":1010,"h":1010,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491264276445,"time":1491264276,"md5":"676S1nirnOI5InkeibSxFw==","fsize":177742,"resto":0,"id":"6KLUsVHB","country":"NL","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"pol-communism-general","country_name":"Netherlands","replies":90,"images":49,"omitted_posts":85,"omitted_images":47},{"no":119418873,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)22:34:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"Communism is dead","filename":"IMG_0010","ext":".png","w":500,"h":519,"tn_w":120,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491273273437,"time":1491273273,"md5":"kHzjOTjXLOEAr3Dv+SBiFw==","fsize":127211,"resto":119401959,"id":"cbulsG04","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119418912,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)22:34:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119401959\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119401959<\/a><br>OP&#039;s delusional fucktardness never fails to amuse me.","filename":"b (52)","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":402,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1491273297797,"time":1491273297,"md5":"xtlvV5n4qNbHUpwABYJY8A==","fsize":19450,"resto":119401959,"id":"ij+FGhsn","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119419158,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)22:37:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119418822\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119418822<\/a><br>I understand that, but what does this have to do with banks?

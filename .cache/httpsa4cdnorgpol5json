Krema II and III had five huge furnaces, each of which had a &quot;triple-muffle&quot; that could burn three bodies simultaneously. They were designed to burn efficiently and quickly, especially when burning many bodies in a row (see Gutman et al., Anatomy of the Auschwitz Death Camp, 1994, pp. 185-186).<br><br>Although the furnaces were designed with three muffles, two to three bodies could almost always be placed in each muffle. Remember that many children were present, and that the victims were often inmates who had been at Auschwitz for months and who were malnourished in the extreme. The Nazis took 70 to 100 kg of animal remains as a &quot;unit&quot; that could be incinerated in one muffle; whether that was one large person or three small ones was irrelevant, technically speaking. H\u00f6ss testified that the Sonderkommando would alternate between putting three and two bodies in each muffle. (See Gutman et al., op. cit., pp. 236, 166, 180n55.)<br><br>Contrary to what the IHR claims in question 42, the furnaces would consume the bodies in anywhere from half an hour to 45 minutes maximum. This is not only verified by eyewitnesses, but by numerous Nazi memos concerning a variety of incineration jobs.<br><br>Here is the arithmetic for a single Krematorium, number II:<br><br> Five furnaces, each with three muffles, each muffle capable of holding two to three corpses simultaneously (call it two) and burning them in half an hour, could reduce 1440 bodies to ash in twenty-four working hours. 5 times 3 times 2, divided by one-half, times 24, equals 1440.<br>cont.","time":1490762479,"resto":118720645,"id":"QA1\/JvrJ","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118748075,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)00:42:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118747931\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118747931<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;A captured memo dated June 28, 1943, sent to SS General Kammler in Berlin, cites the number of bodies that can be disposed of in one day, at Auschwitz-Birkenau, as 4,756. This is apparently based on a 24-hour working day using the above figures, as it cites the capacity of Krema II as 1440. See a photograph of the document, or Pressac, Auschwitz: Technique and Operation of the Gas Chambers, 1989, p. 247. There is argument among historians and technical experts as to whether this represents a theoretical maximum that was never reached in reality except with the aid of additional cremation done in burning pits, or a figure that was reached and possibly exceeded during the worst of the extermination action. Nevertheless, it is clear that Lagace&#039;s claim of 184 bodies daily (Lenski, Robert, The Holocaust on Trial, 1990, p. 252) is not even within an order of magnitude of being correct.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Nobody claims that six million bodies were incinerated.

We were told that a incident took place in WTC I and we should stay put until further notice so the evacuation of that building isn&#039;t compromised. Shortly after we felt a severe shock that knocked me and others out of their chairs as well as cubicle walls. Many of us decided to nix the directive to stay put. We used the stairs and heard, consistent (timed) explosions all the way down to the ground floor. Once we hit the Concourse it was a complete disaster: the walls, which are made of 15&quot; solid marble, had huge sections blasted away laying on the floor... some of it looked pulverized and some was like a powder scattered all around. One of the service elevators near the PATH train entrance had its doors blasted outward! Those steel doors were shredded!! Outside was chaos and it was difficult to tell what was going on, where to go for help, etc. I decided to get as far as I could from the building. I got about 3 blocks away on Fulton St. when I heard a series of high pitched explosive sounds and a something that sounded like a steam train trying to gather momentum. I turned around and saw the building I just left coming down with a pillar of dust and debris as tall as a office building barreling down the street. All I could do was hit the street, cover my head and pray. I stood up covered in a fine, grey dust with huge slabs of steel and glass all over the place. Why I didn&#039;t get impaled or crushed...I had no idea at the time. I&#039;ve since understood why.

This may be the single most important treatment for cystic fibrosis, a genetic disease in which thick mucus can build up in the lungs and be very difficult to expel. Many compounding pharmacies now offer liquid glutathione, and it\u2019s easy to find nebulizers at your local drug store. Glutathione is considered the most potent anti-oxidant our body produces. It\u2019s a string of three amino acids (glutamine cysteine, and glycine) made by every single cell in our bodies. Oxygen itself is an oxidant, and glutathione is the major complex that provides the balance between oxygen levels necessary for life, but not so much that our blood vessels \u201coxidize\u201d (kind of like rusting).<br>Glutathione is a superb detox agent and helps protect us against a myriad of irritants including pollution, poisons, drugs and heavy metals. It\u2019s important to always use the \u201creduced\u201d form of glutathione, also known as GSH. \u201cReduced\u201d has to do with a biochemical process called \u201credox.\u201d \u201cReduction\u201d in this context means attaching an electron to a \u201cradical\u201d molecule, which is missing an electron and desperately trying to become stable by \u201cgrabbing\u201d an electron. GSH neatly stabilizes this cascade of destruction and inflammation. Moreover, inhaling liquid GSH isn\u2019t the only way to benefit from this fantastic natural healing molecule \u2014 although that\u2019s probably the best delivery method for lung diseases. Because GSH is not very stable, some very innovative researchers have<br>been looking into ways of extending the useful shelf life of GSH for decades. Fairly recently there has been a breakthrough with liposomal technology.","time":1490762566,"resto":118740649,"id":"6bV7BtWI","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118748006,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)00:42:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"Das rite whitey,nothing personal.<br>You don&#039;t mind right ?<br>*what to do ?*","filename":"1489648178710","ext":".jpg","w":938,"h":969,"tn_w":242,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490762525512,"time":1490762525,"md5":"7IVV+IL5QYe4X4Q3UY83DQ==","fsize":237469,"resto":0,"id":"sDpIRgY9","country":"IT","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"das-rite-whiteynothing-personal","country_name":"Italy","replies":2,"images":0},{"no":118748056,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)00:42:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"*sells the cotton*","time":1490762557,"resto":118748006,"id":"nIAixkVs","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118748067,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)00:42:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118748006\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118748006<\/a><br>NOT THE COTTON!","time":1490762564,"resto":118748006,"id":"aLVSVW0i","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118734580,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)22:27:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;We are out here displaying our second amendment rights to show that we will not be intimidated by Donald Trump, The Alt-Right, or fascist of any sort.

I think our modern understanding of &quot;drug&quot; use if very skewed and there is common knowledge of dark occults heavily abusing drugs as part of regular ritual. For instance, the whole witches broomstick flying escapade? Witches putting a psychoactive substance of the handle of a broom and setting their bare vaginas on top-is one theory of how witches flying on broomsticks became a thing. It is, however not unheard of for heavy use of drugs being used for not so dark rituals, manna from heaven has been theorized to actually be a psychoactive substance in the past.

Corruption, while certainly not as ubiquitous as it used to be, is still rife in Russia. A man I met in Vladivostok last year, while we were walking through the city, pointed at a half-built church and jokingly told me the reason they had chosen this particular location to construct it was so that city and regional officials could look out their windows and \u201cask God\u2019s forgiveness for their corruption.\u201d<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The fact that Navalny is a vocal Kremlin critic and ardent opponent of Vladimir Putin has ensured that he has become somewhat of a media darling in the West.

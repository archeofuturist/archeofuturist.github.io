No way I&#039;m using that!&#039; Therefore, when it came in the mail two days later (thanks Prime!) and my husband installed it, I stood in the hall and informed him that I would still be using toilet paper thank you very much. Fast forward thirty minutes to when my husband &#039;took it for a spin&#039;, as it were, and exclaimed from the bathroom that it was &#039;the most amazing thing ever and I HAD to try it!&#039;<br><br>I put up a good fight, but in the end, my husband&#039;s darling brown eyes won me over, as they always do, and I decided to give it a whirl.<br><br>Oh my sweet mercy hallelujah. It was heaven. A bit startling at first, if you have never used a bidet, but I have never felt cleaner in my whole life! It also has been helpful to those of us who have hemorrhoids (THANKS CHILDBIRTH) because it is a bit gentle and less abrasive than toilet paper tends to be. We haven&#039;t bought toilet paper since we bought it (March, so, 4 months) and I haven&#039;t missed it a bit. My husband and I now fight over using the downstairs bathroom, because the upstairs bathroom is lacking the glorious invention that is the Luxe Neo 120. I should take off a star for wrecking my marriage, Luxe Bidet Neo 120! THANKS.<br><br>As for the bidet itself, it is easy peasy to install (according to my husband; I wouldn&#039;t know because I was having a toilet paper protest in the hall at the time of its installation) and simple to clean for the most part...the back (where it attaches to the toilet) is a bit more difficult to clean than your average, sad, greatly lacking, bidet-less toilet, but nothing major at all. The nozzle where the water shoots out is covered by a neat little &#039;sanitary shield&#039; which is a nice touch. To clean the nozzle itself you simply turn the &#039;self cleaning&#039; knob on the bidet controls and instead of squirting &#039;out&#039; it squirts down to rinse itself off.

The resulting multi-lens system provides an opportunity to help correct aberration, a condition where lenses fail to bring all wavelengths of color to a single focal point, which in turn may facilitate higher quality imaging from smaller devices, researchers added.<br><br>The researchers developed the 3D lenses by blasting a light-sensitive material onto a glass substrate with a femtosecond laser, which has pulse durations shorter than 100 femtoseconds. The material then absorbed two photons that exposed it and crosslinked polymers within the material. The unexposed material was washed using a solvent, leaving the hardened, crosslinked polymer that will then serve as the optical element.<br><br>The resulting lens\u2019 diameter measures about 120 millionths of a meter, which makes it easily as small as a grain of table salt. The lenses can go from wide to narrow and may provide low to high image resolutions. Each of the lenses has a specific line of sight \u2013 clear at the center, blurry at the sides \u2013 capped by a curvature at the end. This mechanism mimics how the fovea, the small depression in the middle of the retina, collects light, and how the brain connects images from both eyes to come up with a single, distinct picture.","filename":"bre1","ext":".jpg","w":1084,"h":626,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":144,"tim":1490498345935,"time":1490498345,"md5":"XC6zDkcjKPwFMqlYjpudRQ==","fsize":72220,"resto":0,"id":"5bQNx5UM","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"its-over-niggers-the-jews-won","country_name":"United States","replies":113,"images":26,"omitted_posts":108,"omitted_images":26,"tail_size":50},{"no":118323860,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)01:19:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118323554\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118323554<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Eastern Orthodox Patriarch and Roman Catholic Pope meet for the first time in a thousand years<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Goes immediately on trip to Antarctica with John Kerry and Buzz Aldrin<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Buzz Aldrin has a heart attack, tweets &quot;it&#039;s evil&quot;, and is committed to a mental asylum afterward<\/span><br><br>Yea, something is fucking fishy there","time":1490505577,"resto":118312846,"id":"Fc\/5\/VXV","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118323874,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)01:19:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118316953\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118316953<\/a><br><a href=\"#p118316953\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118316953<\/a><br>im not sure if your still in the thread but honestly i think bre knows alot more than she lets on. when that retard got beat down in chicago she lost her shit and almost went full on deus vult. i also think she&#039;s from louisiana and the nogs down there are absolutely the worst stereotypical ghetto mofos so she has prolly seen some shit.","time":1490505586,"resto":118312846,"id":"5bQNx5UM","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118324309,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)01:24:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118323554\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118323554<\/a><br><a href=\"#p118323860\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118323860<\/a><br>ive heard all the buzz about antarctica and will def keep my eyes open on info for that. it would be awesome if they found a new ancient site or something. im just so jaded tho that i don&#039;t think they would ever tell us about it. its pretty common knowledge that they do secret shit there but if they told people about some alien or ancient stuff then people would want to go see for themselves thereby potentially compromising the secret stuff. so idk","time":1490505864,"resto":118312846,"id":"5bQNx5UM","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118324745,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)01:29:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118323154\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118323154<\/a><br>Graham Hancock<br>David Wilcock<br>Steven Greer<br>Lloyd Pye<br>G.

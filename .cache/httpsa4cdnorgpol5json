When you have a centrist versus a radical, in this boring day and age where people can&#039;t be inspired to step outside of their comfort zone, the centrist always wins.<br><br>The reason I think it is important to have this discussion is because there seems to be a lot of Americans on this board who are just saying &quot;REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED WITH TRUMP&quot; but that&#039;s a really damaging way to look at this. Trump won with a sliver of a margin and even then, there was evidence of a &quot;secret Trump vote.&quot; The same rules do not apply to France and if this board gets tunnel vision like that, we&#039;ll have a hard reality check two weeks from now. This election is arguably the most important election in Europe.","filename":"o shit","ext":".jpg","w":768,"h":768,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492972859078,"time":1492972859,"md5":"kM9omfgmMBFTtN0abeTF\/A==","fsize":213759,"resto":0,"id":"M\/ZBA8D7","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"french-election-discussion-1","country_name":"United States","replies":298,"images":80,"omitted_posts":293,"omitted_images":79,"tail_size":50},{"no":122504777,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)19:07:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122502103\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122502103<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;shitskins<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;jobs<\/span><br>top jej","time":1492988876,"resto":122463711,"id":"WrHuKPIi","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":122505137,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)19:10:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122463711\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122463711<\/a><br>she won&#039;t win because people in europe currently fear &quot;&quot;fascism&quot;&quot; way more than islam","time":1492989030,"resto":122463711,"id":"ct7DY9m8","country":"IT","country_name":"Italy"},{"no":122505263,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)19:11:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122503205\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122503205<\/a><br>this this","time":1492989095,"resto":122463711,"id":"F5z2FJmS","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122505491,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)19:13:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122463711\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122463711<\/a><br>Who cares?

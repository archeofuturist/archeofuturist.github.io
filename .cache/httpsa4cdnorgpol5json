It just makes him interesting. When you have all these features and more in spades you realize that the only leg up you have from ugly\/fat\/manlets is that women will now grant you the time of day- only to fuck with your head. So in some ways the ugly guys have it better.<br><br>Most &quot;Chads&quot; just want to have fun, love, play, care about someone, have that person care about him. They don&#039;t grow up in narcissistic spartanesque broken homes where having any weakness or emotion is quickly trampled out of you since birth. So when that girl targeted your Chad co-worker he might been attractive but that didn&#039;t make him any less prepared for her onslaught of head games. I bet she was the hottest thing he was tapping and he felt some sort of closeness to her in those &quot;few weeks&#039; which again, everyone will experience. She then held that against him and he broke. Now he&#039;s boring and she tried to spice it up by including you in the mix, a probably number 2 in that hierarchy. <br><br>I swear to god I&#039;ve never gotten one second of rest with girls that were interested in me. It&#039;s just one huge chain of curve balls and sinkers. Most guys can&#039;t take that, they want some girl to love and this kills them. The only &quot;broken heart&quot; stories you hear from women are those where Chad was pounding a hot girl and she was his second in line. While he was fretting over her and telling her he loved her this B girl was faced with the reality that her mind-fuck game was completely ineffectieve with this guy. You can&#039;t yearn for two people, or at least, it&#039;s very hard and one always takes priority. Those are the alpha stories you hear. But they don&#039;t necessarily come from a real Alpha mindset. Just happenstance.<br><br>Even for psychopaths it&#039;s generally hard to not feel some sense of ownership over the girl that&#039;s their main starter. Women just play with this mercilessly simply because their boredom triggers the loss of feelz.","filename":"lovebeingabitch","ext":".gif","w":500,"h":281,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1490824698320,"time":1490824698,"md5":"aGAUqo6Zsjgp1xAAlp7XmQ==","fsize":870720,"resto":118809132,"id":"EBcyMamp","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118833392,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)16:57:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"Give me your best Jewish names, I&#039;ll start:<br><br>Bernie Goldburger.","filename":"jew","ext":".jpg","w":501,"h":585,"tn_w":214,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490821035420,"time":1490821035,"md5":"Qd00DtdSFTu8p7SdSa7DSA==","fsize":75592,"resto":0,"id":"W94S16Q5","country":"NL","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"give-me-your-best-jewish-names-ill-start","country_name":"Netherlands","replies":28,"images":11,"omitted_posts":23,"omitted_images":10},{"no":118838961,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)17:47:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"Chaim Shmoiberhimelsteinbergcircumsteinwi<wbr>tz","filename":"hqdefault","ext":".jpg","w":480,"h":360,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1490824046388,"time":1490824046,"md5":"mAWNg3REMUMbiWBTais60g==","fsize":5355,"resto":118833392,"id":"u\/SEiu7G","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118839073,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)17:48:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"Rabbi Shekelgrabber","time":1490824106,"resto":118833392,"id":"qDejFzGf","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":118839276,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)17:50:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"Rabecca Goyette","filename":"Rabecca Goyette","ext":".jpg","w":400,"h":300,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1490824207877,"time":1490824207,"md5":"wTLqr5B8liI5xPv0uStIUw==","fsize":21512,"resto":118833392,"id":"2n7aNy6\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118839511,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)17:52:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118836481\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118836481<\/a><br><br>Momo Applebach","time":1490824324,"resto":118833392,"id":"0S3PUyzz","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118840240,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)17:58:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118833392\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118833392<\/a><br>Chaim Moishe Rosenbergstein-Feldman","filename":"merchant3d","ext":".png","w":586,"h":586,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490824696602,"time":1490824696,"md5":"RyEF04dhd73l+t1Ydk4C8A==","fsize":270701,"resto":118833392,"id":"004QRG\/K","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118835471,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)17:16:37","name":"Anonymous","sub":"How do we mass Red Pill Canadians","com":"On the fact they<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Aren&#039;t American<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Do not have American Rights<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Do not have American Constitution<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Have NO RIGHTS at all<\/span><br><br>IF all the canadians woke up at once to these FACTS, they&#039;d lose their shit and go nuts and probably burn down the Parliament buildings.<br><br>Ideas?","filename":"The Current Canadian Flag","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":427,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1490822197044,"time":1490822197,"md5":"8RmRQAbnRbyuY4P5pkVOrg==","fsize":20151,"resto":0,"id":"VgyUCTLF","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"how-do-we-mass-red-pill-canadians","country_name":"Canada","replies":49,"images":3,"omitted_posts":44,"omitted_images":3},{"no":118839905,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)17:55:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118839666\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118839666<\/a><br>Of course it happened, but the language you used implies those things are bad.

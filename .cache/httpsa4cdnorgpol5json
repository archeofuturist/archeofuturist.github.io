If there is a disagreement, he goes to his mother\u2019s apartment in Brooklyn.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Another source, who worked closely with Bill and Hillary Clinton for several years, corroborates this, saying the breakup was \u201cmore for optics for the campaign and [under] pressure from Hillary\u2019s camp.\u201d<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;It\u2019s hard to believe a reconciliation is under consideration given how many times Weiner has betrayed his wife. In May 2011, he accidentally tweeted out a photo of his erect penis in boxer briefs that he apparently meant to send privately to a college student. Asked about the tweet, he initially denied sending it. Two weeks later, Weiner resigned from Congress as more women with more photos emerged.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;While Weiner was running for mayor in 2013, additional sexts and photos came out, posted under the alias \u201cCarlos Danger.\u201d Refusing to withdraw from the race, he came in fifth place with a mere 4.9 percent of the vote. As his wife led Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign, even more sexts were uncovered. Last September, the Daily Mail alleged that Weiner had sent X-rated messages to a 15-year-old girl.<\/span><br><br>YOU CAN&#039;T BEAT THE WEINER.","filename":"afp_fp4jn","ext":".jpg","w":915,"h":610,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1490560666880,"time":1490560666,"md5":"L8JstwY5\/7gnq6vSEAXMYA==","fsize":95284,"resto":0,"id":"\/y64toqz","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"huma-trying-getting-back-together-with-weiner","country_name":"United States","replies":25,"images":13,"omitted_posts":20,"omitted_images":12},{"no":118416372,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)17:12:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118416019\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118416019<\/a><br>Attention whoring?

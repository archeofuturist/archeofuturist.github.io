I hope you know that Jesus believed that it happened. Just because the jews of today have been corrupted doesn&#039;t mean we have to deny their persecutions. If the Exodus didn&#039;t happen then everything Jesus said was a lie, and Christianity and Islam are all full of false prophets. Unless you are a heathen you couldn&#039;t possible believe such a thing, right \/pol\/? Obviously the Holocaust didn&#039;t happen but it doesn&#039;t mean we have to deny Hebrew slavery.

Even in recent times rulers have tried to obliterate the works and reputations of their predecessors. Anything regarded as embarrassing or distasteful was left out of Egyptian inscriptions or effaced as soon as possible.

Josephus speaks of another Egyptian historian, Chaeremon, who says that Joseph and Moses were driven out of Egypt at the same time; also Josephus mentions a Lysimachus who tells a similar story.\u2014Against Apion, I, 228, 238 (26); 288, 290 (32); 299 (33); 304-311 (34).","time":1492052909,"resto":120846681,"id":"IiASXAoq","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120860396,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)23:28:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120858219\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120858219<\/a><br>Interesting.<br><br>So much history in the last 100 years has been proven to be false, and yet we are to believe something from thousands of years ago is accurate?

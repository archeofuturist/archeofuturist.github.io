The Messiah, Jesus, the son of Mary, was but a messenger of God and His word which He directed to Mary and a soul [created at a command] from Him. So believe in God and His messengers. And do not say, &quot;Three&quot;; desist - it is better for you. Indeed, God is but one God. Exalted is He above having a son. To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. And sufficient is God as Disposer of affairs.","filename":"Allah_the_One_and_Only","ext":".png","w":1280,"h":1280,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491170298467,"time":1491170298,"md5":"kSOPjZkIZ7OvvGHN6fv9Rg==","fsize":465706,"resto":119251069,"id":"sktg4AKQ","country":"FR","country_name":"France"}]},{"posts":[{"no":119234613,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)15:23:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"Anyone else here who think it&#039;s fine for Europeans and Asians to mix?","filename":"zhang-ziyi-vivi-nevo","ext":".jpg","w":457,"h":309,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":169,"tim":1491161032502,"time":1491161032,"md5":"5Uf8q57U0nENEqUuUCVreg==","fsize":90120,"resto":0,"id":"zmMRQ1+S","country":"NO","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"anyone-else-here-who-think-its-fine-for-europeans","country_name":"Norway","replies":158,"images":41,"omitted_posts":153,"omitted_images":38,"tail_size":50},{"no":119250927,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)17:51:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119249794\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119249794<\/a><br>The cunning of the white man combined with the rampant sociopathy and utter soullessness of the gook <br><br>Truly this is the most monstrous race possible to spawn","filename":"1484856270811","ext":".png","w":675,"h":619,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":114,"tim":1491169877115,"time":1491169877,"md5":"nPm2AFqlWShwid1j42VMqw==","fsize":784881,"resto":119234613,"id":"9aBr7wrH","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119251272,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)17:54:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"Elliot Rodgers - Probably one of the most famous hapas, went on a mass killing spree after his problems with women.

Here are my thoughts:<br><br>1. Following Barthes essay on Wrestling, it is clear that all three subjects lack any trace of subtlety. In showtunes, there is nothing intellectual complex, instead we are greeted with pure pathos. In the case of politics, arguments are communicated in their most base form (&quot;Kill all jews&quot;, &quot;End white domination&quot;). In the case of wrestling, the language is reduced to pure physicality.<br><br>2. There is not sliding moral scale of gray, there is only Good and Evil. All three live in universes where there are clear Heroes and Villians. I believe that this suggests an incapacity of any moral reasoning beyond the level of a young child.<br><br>3. The major consumers tend to have difficulty conveying their emotions through language with partners and lovers, and they long for a more simplistic world.","filename":"tumblr_static_tumblr_static_al211c7uca8sk44ckkk4cs8o8_640","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":282,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":141,"tim":1491170251648,"time":1491170251,"md5":"SXUw0zOJskgpwKVYcizegQ==","fsize":52674,"resto":0,"id":"0fBWHtox","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"ive-noticed-something-recently-pol-and-i-need","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0}]}]}

If your biggest problem at the moment is a couple of guys questioning their sexuality at the sight of a guy looking like a girl and you&#039;re scared that the white population is in decline because the number of gays grows along with the population, then might I ask you to share some of the shit you&#039;re on, most of us are upset about the recent influx of crimes against humanity coming from the Muslim world, the judicial disparities that appear between sexes and races, the growth and acceptance of domestic terrorism, the distrustful media and so on. <br><br>And I think there&#039;s nothing wrong with consensual gay sex as long as it is kept private and not shoved in our faces. If you have an actual argument against it then let&#039;s hear it and discuss, paranoid Alex Jones crap with no evidence about turning all the frogs gay doesn&#039;t count.","time":1492443381,"resto":121526825,"id":"jtP7a59M","country":"RO","country_name":"Romania"},{"no":121539171,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)11:39:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121528401\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121528401<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;You realize you have zero chance of getting birth control banned federally, right?<\/span><br><br>Well, there is zero chance of saving the Western Civilization from total collapse or a very bloody reset in general, specifically because weapons of its extinction, like birth control, no-fault divorse, wellfare or, for that matter, universal franchise, which makes sure that all of the above are here to stay, are not going anywhere. <br><br>That does not mean we should not recognize those weapons for what they are.","time":1492443543,"resto":121526825,"id":"RSS0+DWX","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":121539344,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)11:40:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121528349\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121528349<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Normal straight people will tell you 100% that they cannot choose to be gay<\/span><br><br>I&#039;m sure Jamal and Ahmed in the nearest prison would be glad to demonstrate you factual wrongness of this statement.","time":1492443638,"resto":121526825,"id":"RSS0+DWX","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":121539528,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)11:42:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121527963\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121527963<\/a><br>bait post, redditors need to lurk more to spot these and not just instantly respond","time":1492443748,"resto":121526825,"id":"j1IJAPCT","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]},{"posts":[{"no":121518369,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)08:10:23","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Explain How Female Promiscuity Effect Society ?","com":"Please I need a solid reasonable and well proven examples, studies, and researches that proves how female promiscuity is bad for society.","filename":"end slut shaming","ext":".png","w":529,"h":528,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":249,"tim":1492431023127,"time":1492431023,"md5":"50UHvfX5h3j4A3lxCll1Mg==","fsize":32796,"resto":0,"id":"Vnzo0Lh9","country":"FI","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"explain-how-female-promiscuity-effect-society","country_name":"Finland","replies":152,"images":53,"omitted_posts":147,"omitted_images":49,"tail_size":50},{"no":121538207,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)11:30:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121537332\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121537332<\/a><br>http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/scienc<wbr>e\/article\/pii\/S0304394005011833<br><br>Here&#039;s some writing on Prarie Voles, which are practically the go-to mammal for extrapolating findings onto humans at this point.<br><br>I&#039;m trying to find the studies that dealt with humans specifically, but it&#039;s becoming a pain in the ass without JSTOR access.

The Howard government wanted to destroy Hanson and get back those lost voters, but also had no intention of reducing non-white immigration. Instead, they wanted to increase it massively. Howard put Abbott in charge of formulating the government&#039;s response to the Hanson phenomenon. His plan: redirect the focus of the immigration debate from the ever increasing flood of legal immigrants to the numerically insignificant number of illegal immigrants arriving by boat. The plan worked: the debate went from &quot;the Asian invasion&quot; to &quot;stop the boats&quot;, the numbers of immigrants skyrocketed, China and India replaced the UK as the source of most immigration.

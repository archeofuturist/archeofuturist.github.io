It is simulating gravity since the force perceived by gravity is indistinguishable from acceleration. Gravity happens because mass warps spacetime, causing time to tick at different rates in an object. Acceleration is defined at the change in velocity over time, which in turn is the change in position over itme, dx\/dt. Acceleration modifies the dx, while dt is constant. Gravity modifies the dt while dx is basically constant. End result is still a change in the rate, so it feels the same, but it isn&#039;t the same thing.","time":1492917209,"resto":122366569,"id":"cWIum3Iw","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":122366532,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)22:36:38","name":"Anonymous","sub":"God&#039;s mistake?","com":"Hey \/pol\/ I&#039;ve long wondered, are women God&#039;s mistake?<br><br>They lie often and are good at it.<br>They&#039;re cruel and manipulative.<br>They&#039;re promiscuous and hypocritical.<br>They stab you in the back and blame you for it.<br>They trap you with their youthful beauty, then become hideous beasts later in life.<br><br>Are women God&#039;s mistake?","filename":"7bdff51fdd11c8365741511c93227b05","ext":".jpg","w":236,"h":365,"tn_w":161,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492914998502,"time":1492914998,"md5":"UTzwtbzupw2MaNrNMF0vog==","fsize":16927,"resto":0,"id":"KAfUUkm+","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"gods-mistake","country_name":"United States","replies":31,"images":2,"omitted_posts":26,"omitted_images":1},{"no":122369231,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)22:59:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122368958\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122368958<\/a><br><br>Massachusetts we have a heroin issue, especially in Fitchburg area where I live.<br><br>She went from smoking weed (which I didn&#039;t even like because she got even sluttier when high) to popping Oxys that her &quot;&quot;friend&quot;&quot; sold her on multiple occasions.<br><br>Read smart idea for a girl to pop oxys when her mom died of a heroin overdose.","time":1492916343,"resto":122366532,"id":"3bmiSSaV","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122369285,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)22:59:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"i bet the whole &quot;the snake made me do it &quot; was just anther female lie , women are incapable of accepting responsibility for their actions","time":1492916373,"resto":122366532,"id":"MgmLvL1C","country":"GR","country_name":"Greece"},{"no":122369353,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)23:00:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122366929\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122366929<\/a><br>not true.

Concerning that \/pol\/ was about to be kill, the original users made a discord and advertised the discord on the thread. Month after month hundreds and thousands of users flocked to the discord for a more structured and organized place for politically incorrect discussion. There were raids against many foes and friendships were founded with other discords. Many famous autists and kameraden from the board passed through the doors of the server. There was drama, too much fucking drama holy shit.Over that time the community grew and grew. New channels were introduced to represent the growing community and the mod group was expanded. Happenings happened, memes were memed, and there was autism on a scale that had never been seen before. A lot of fun times are had in this discord, and every night when you hop on you; will see channels full of people talking in text.

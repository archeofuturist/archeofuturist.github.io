It&#039;s quite similar to an old slave mentality in that blacks are afraid of not doing what they are told. Just as example, during the high point of American slavery, plantation owners told there slaves that if they left the farm, they would be killed due to the creatures that roamed around the property or they would just fall dead once they run far enough away. The same shit happens today, Democrats using the naivete of blacks and exploiting them to their own ends. Only now, blacks are even less useful now than during that time! At least we would work for the benefit of the country and not to its detriment.

Childhood is when girls should be protected, and it traditionally ended at puberty. &quot;Adolescence&quot;, ie staying with your parents after puberty, is harmful to cognitive development, and is responsible for modern woes like teenage rebellion against conservative values, high divorce rates, and the dissolution of the nuclear family.<br><br>http:\/\/help.fortroubledteens.com\/th<wbr>e-danger-of-treating-teens-like-chi<wbr>ldren.html<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The age of maturity keeps changing. At one time a child was considered an adult when they reached puberty. Then it was moved to 18 years old. Now, a child can live at home and act like a dependent up until they are 26 without any problem. Adolescence is an artificial extension of childhood; a segment of society of adults that are still treated like children.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The problem with extending a teens childhood years can be frustrating for everyone involved. The teen\u2019s mind and body are telling them they are adults but everyone around them still treats them like a child. The result is anger and depression in most cases. With all the potential being bottled up it starts to boil over into society and into the families. Divorce rates are very high when there are teenagers in the home. All the frustration is vented somewhere.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;A teens world is void of freedom, responsibility, and realism. Instead of working and interacting with adults they spend over 65 hours a week with fellow teens. This huge segment of teens are targeted by aggressive marketers of large businesses.

ENOUGH OF THESE MUSLIM SCUMBAGS<br><br>After they gave notice in February 2015, Alabi says he bent over backwards to accommodate the Egyptian-born couple in booking acceptable times to show their apartment to prospective new tenants. At first, Madkour tried to argue that the landlord couldn\u2019t show the unit when his wife was home. Alabi explained that with 24 hours notice, the law gave him the authority to enter even if she was there.<br><br>They called the police, claiming that his shovelling snow outside their apartment was harassment. The officers confirmed that Alabi was legally allowed to show their unit when they were there. That\u2019s when they suddenly raised the religion issue, he says, and told him he couldn\u2019t enter during their prayer times. He agreed.<br><br>That still wasn\u2019t enough, Alabi says.<br><br>In addition to the 24-hour notice, and the prayer times, they also wanted him to text in advance. But when he texted them, they didn\u2019t reply - so he stopped.<br><br>And then there was the issue of removing his shoes. At the tribunal, the couple said they prayed in their bedroom and the floor had to remain clean. Yet Alabi claims the couple never had a problem before when he wore his shoes to make repairs in the apartment. And he wasn\u2019t wearing outside shoes, but the shoes he wore in his own home. He\u2019d come around to their apartment wearing rubbers over them and then take them off at the door. For that, he was accused of being racist.","filename":"(((macleans)))","ext":".jpg","w":501,"h":676,"tn_w":185,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493908772548,"time":1493908772,"md5":"7Y8q4\/CiU0AnLCo7xS07NA==","fsize":37112,"resto":0,"id":"v5pTvSH0","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"canada-is-a-muslim-country","country_name":"Canada","replies":22,"images":9,"omitted_posts":17,"omitted_images":6},{"no":124071059,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)11:32:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124070834\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124070834<\/a><br>How is this normal?

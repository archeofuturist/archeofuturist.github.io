Like intelligence. Maybe they&#039;re not very bright in those low income areas, and I&#039;m sure that&#039;s true. The IQ rates in black areas are also low. We know that if we control for IQ, blacks have similar income to whites. So that&#039;s an answer. IQ. What&#039;s the answer for crime? Crime and poverty are correlated BUT rich black people have as high an incarceration rate as poor whites. It certainly looks like race is a factor. I haven&#039;t seen anything suggesting otherwise, besides &quot;it&#039;s complicated&quot;, which is not an argument, pardon the meme.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;if blacks are committing more crimes then it would follow that there is more variation in their communities.<\/span><br>Except I&#039;ve never heard that that&#039;s the case in black communities more so than white communities. If you have data to back the claim that there is a higher income gap in the ghetto then please show it. I think it&#039;s highly dubious to make the claim that because large wealth gaps in-community leads to higher crime rates, that MUST mean that there are large in-community wealth gaps in black areas just because they have more crime.<br><br>I&#039;d like to see the data on that. We know that race is a factor that correlates with crime, and we know that a high wealth gap correlate with crime. Two of those three things we KNOW are present in black areas, crime and blacks. We don&#039;t know about the third one and it&#039;s far fetched to just assume that that factor would play the largest role in black areas.","time":1490054886,"resto":117545921,"id":"Gwjvncyb","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":117556105,"now":"03\/20\/17(Mon)20:10:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117545921\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117545921<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;what is systematic racial oppression<\/span>","time":1490055004,"resto":117545921,"id":"hw+X82db","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":117556567,"now":"03\/20\/17(Mon)20:13:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"The difference is space, shove all these hicks in to tightly close apartments with extremely low amounts actually owning any land<br><br>I guarantee you crime will increase, then wait a few decades for the cycle to feed in to itself and BAM<br><br>You have yourself a redneck ghetto","filename":"14534484454","ext":".jpg","w":280,"h":210,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1490055215230,"time":1490055215,"md5":"Dw+NKAmDdy7HnwRl7jJS\/A==","fsize":10050,"resto":117545921,"id":"kPrpxH6u","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"}]},{"posts":[{"no":117549971,"now":"03\/20\/17(Mon)19:27:32","name":"Anonymous","sub":"You white bois are gonna die out very soon","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;UK: 46% of babies born are from mothers with foreign backgrounds.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Ireland: 16% of babies born are from mothers with foreign backgrounds<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;France: 49% of babies born are from mothers with foreign backgrounds<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Spain: 20% of babies born are from mothers with foreign backgrounds<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Portugal: 13% of babies born are from mothers with foreign backgrounds<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Belgium: 54% of babies born are from mothers with foreign backgrounds<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Netherlands: 44% of babies born are from mothers with foreign backgrounds<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Italy: 29% of babies born are from mothers with foreign backgrounds<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Germany: 36% of babies born are from mothers with foreign backgrounds<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Austria: 29% of babies born are from mothers with foreign backgrounds<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Switzerland: 19% of babies born are from mothers with foreign backgrounds<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Denmark: 37% of babies born are from mothers with foreign backgrounds<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Sweden: 41% of babies born are from mothers with foreign backgrounds<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Norway: 25% of babies born are from mothers with foreign backgrounds<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Finland: 19% of babies born are from mothers with foreign backgrounds<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Greece: 16% of babies born are from mothers with foreign backgrounds<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Russia: 45% of babies born are from mothers with foreign backgrounds <\/span><br><br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Demog<wbr>raphics_of_Europe<br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Demog<wbr>raphics_of_the_European_Union<br><br>Ahahahahahahahahhaha","filename":"terrorist-laughing","ext":".jpg","w":775,"h":553,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":178,"tim":1490052452533,"time":1490052452,"md5":"ba1OMGotY3OPRVyxV3VzUQ==","fsize":74498,"resto":0,"id":"7ylBhBjx","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"you-white-bois-are-gonna-die-out-very-soon","country_name":"United States","replies":17,"images":3,"omitted_posts":12,"omitted_images":3},{"no":117555437,"now":"03\/20\/17(Mon)20:05:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117549971\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117549971<\/a><br>whites lel theres no whites here","time":1490054710,"resto":117549971,"id":"qkO10\/pd","country":"PT","country_name":"Portugal"},{"no":117555820,"now":"03\/20\/17(Mon)20:07:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117549971\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117549971<\/a><br>INSHALLAH BROTHER<br><br>CONQUER THE WHITE WOMAN&#039;S WOMB","filename":"wo","ext":".jpg","w":399,"h":385,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":120,"tim":1490054872848,"time":1490054872,"md5":"baBX2GH9x0BEBn0aLFr8oA==","fsize":28148,"resto":117549971,"id":"rpYsmHfn","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":117556188,"now":"03\/20\/17(Mon)20:10:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117549971\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117549971<\/a><br><br>why is a shitskin like you in the US?

It seems to be the norm in the west so you are more likely to be accepted if you are circumcised just for aesthetics alone. I like the look of cut penises better but that is just my opinion, I know there are a lot of ladies who agree with me though. I have had this conversation with my friends before and they all agree they like circumcised more based on looks.<br><br>I live in the US so I have never had sex with or seen an uncircumcised man but one of my roommates studied abroad in Portugal and she had a boyfriend there who was uncircumcised and she said he under-performed greatly, I think she just wanted to stay for his money or something lol, she got spoiled.. It makes sense that more sensitivity would lead to premature ejaculation and an unsatasfied woman. Like I guess the natural penis is meant to just spread the seed as fast as possible so it makes sense.<br><br>What I know about the performance is anecdotal but all the friends i&#039;ve had conversations with have agreed that we like the look of circumcised a lot more.<br><br>So what&#039;s the problem with it? It&#039;s a non-invasive procedure that is done at birth to normal kids. If I have a son I am going to have him circumcised just so he doesn&#039;t get made fun of by any of his future girlfriends, me and my sister had this conversation and she chose to circumcise her son for the same reason.","filename":"banana","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":720,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1490051145552,"time":1490051145,"md5":"XYyxHU\/DTb35ifcXbKOYKw==","fsize":91134,"resto":0,"id":"Q76ZiA0e","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"circumcision","country_name":"United States","replies":85,"images":19,"omitted_posts":80,"omitted_images":19},{"no":117554808,"now":"03\/20\/17(Mon)20:00:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"Don&#039;t reply to slide threads.

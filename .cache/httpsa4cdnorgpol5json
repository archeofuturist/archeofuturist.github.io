The Bulgars, although the ruling class, were much less numerous than the Slavs and Thracians, of which there were many, and therefore quickly assimilated into Slavic culture (although many aspects of Bulgar and Thracian culture remained), until by the 10th century they had adopted the Slavic language, with the Bulgar language going extinct in the kingdom (Bulgaria also created the Cyrillic alphabet :D).

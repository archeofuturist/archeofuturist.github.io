I propose we bring this to an end. It&#039;s time to start complaining to the management about CNN. It&#039;s time to get the normies on your Zuckbook to complain about CNN. The first step is memes. This thread is for gathering all currently available memes showing the irresponsible reporting and outright lies propagated by CNN. This thread is also for the creation of new memes about CNN from the most recently available material. Once created we spread these memes. Once these start appearing on the Zuckbook feeds of angry Boomer normies we can hope to see the Boomers begin to do what they do best - which is complain. Over time, we need to have CNN turned off in as many public places as possible. Some well crafted memes posted to the local dentist or doctors office with a question as to why they still play CNN could work wonders.","filename":"170226132128-how-trump-turned-fake-news-into-a-slur-00021929-full-169","ext":".jpg","w":1600,"h":900,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1491359179514,"time":1491359179,"md5":"jYw6BxiS16c2IARAthO+lw==","fsize":208548,"resto":0,"id":"WEc64uTp","country":"CA","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"cnnmwg-cnn-meme-war-general","country_name":"Canada","replies":13,"images":5,"omitted_posts":8,"omitted_images":5},{"no":119554734,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)22:36:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"Why can&#039;t someone just get rid of these people?","time":1491359784,"resto":119553475,"id":"Nn7dmcxw","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119555033,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)22:39:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119553475\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119553475<\/a><br>good idea","time":1491359941,"resto":119553475,"id":"DPOXR9JE","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":119555160,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)22:40:05","name":"\/cnnmwg\/ **CNN Meme War General**","filename":"fakenews_cnn","ext":".png","w":440,"h":244,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":69,"tim":1491360005766,"time":1491360005,"md5":"KyRNvkKuQF8beyYpOAB+3Q==","fsize":185234,"resto":119553475,"id":"WEc64uTp","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119555332,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)22:41:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119553475\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119553475<\/a><br>You&#039;re late OP<br><br>Inform the Trump General.

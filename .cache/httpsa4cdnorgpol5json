in a ruling that then-candidate Donald Trump incited the use of violence against three protesters when he told supporters at a campaign rally a year ago to &quot;get &#039;em out of here.&quot;<br><br>U. S. District Judge David J. Hale of the Western District of Kentucky also wrote in an opinion and order released Friday that because violence had broken out at a prior Trump rally and that known hate group members were in the Louisville crowd, Trump&#039;s ordering the removal of an African-American woman was &quot;particularly reckless.&quot;<br><br>Citing case law from tumultuous 1960s race riots and other student protests, Hale rejected motions to dismiss the pending complaint against Trump and three supporters in the crowd that was filed by three protesters after a March 1, 2016, campaign rally in Louisville. Only a portion of the defendants&#039; motion was granted, but the decision means that the bulk of the claims will proceed.<br><br>The protesters, Henry Brousseau, Kashiya Nwanguma and Molly Shah, are seeking unspecified monetary damages. They claim they were assaulted by audience members who were riled up by Trump. Besides Trump, the lawsuit names three defendants in attendance \u2014 Matthew Heimbach, a leader with the white supremacist group Traditional Youth Network from Paoli, Ind.; Alvin Bamberger, a member of the Korean War Veterans Association from Ohio; and an unknown individual.","filename":"MatthewHeimbach","ext":".jpg","w":512,"h":512,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491698575924,"time":1491698575,"md5":"GMEV+iuSSy86J\/LOQuT3Hw==","fsize":32796,"resto":0,"id":"hZY4GrAb","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"this-is-the-face-of-white-nationalism-in-2017","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":120199872,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)19:22:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"ITT: Post things you love about your country","filename":"British_Houses_of_Parliament[1]","ext":".jpg","w":3461,"h":2295,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":165,"tim":1491693746342,"time":1491693746,"md5":"yX\/osG4eF\/fg6jQcuxG49Q==","fsize":1936377,"resto":0,"id":"XgBbqW6F","country":"GB","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"itt-post-things-you-love-about-your-country","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":125,"images":66,"omitted_posts":120,"omitted_images":61,"tail_size":50},{"no":120209750,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)20:41:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120202627\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120202627<\/a><br>Now that I&#039;m an adult and no longer an edgy atheist, churches are unironically my favourite buildings.<br><br>They are the most important cultural legacy left upon our land - and indeed the whole of Europe.<br><br>Nobody fucking appreciates it now.

These people were inspired to reach the heavens, which is why churches were always so tall - of course they were the ONLY buildings that were even remotely that tall for hundreds of years. They were, and still are, architectural masterpieces. They weren&#039;t built this tall out of necessity, or because some egotistical dictator wanted a monument to himself.

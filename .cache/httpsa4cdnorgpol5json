National-socialism today is by definition a pan-european identity movement and political ideology. The european colonies - Straya, Canada, US, some south american countries such as Uruguay ad Argentina, were settled by many different european cultures and still managed to organically find ways to compromise. Uruguay was settled by many spaniards but also a shitton of wops and germans and yet today they all speak spanish as a first language. It&#039;s different for , say, a Dutch or French natsoc party since they can all point to a singular language and history as the basis for the ethnostate. The crux of the issue is this: does this or that person come from the wider european christendom? do they want to build a state for the goyim outside of the zionist&#039;s reach and that of the jewish central banking system? Do they agree on basic concepts such as loyalty, order, emphasis on the nuclear family?

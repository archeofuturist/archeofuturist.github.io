We\u2019re a little more right wing, which means most of us are aware that niggers are inferior and shouldn\u2019t be bred with and here you millennials are watching niggers on TV like a bunch of cucks? No wonder your generation failed so miserably, you\u2019re all a bunch of lazy entitled losers whose only plan in college was to finish. Well you know what, I\u2019m not a dumb spic or nigger fucker like you, I have a plan for college, I\u2019ve got the right major picked out, you know what, I planned on dropping out and starting a startup, hiring a bunch of Pajeets and Gooks to do the work for me. Generation Z is uncucked and nationalist, we support Donald Trump, Marine Le Pen and Nigel Farage against the globalists and Jews. You guys can stay cucked because I\u2019m gonna be blazing past you financially while you\u2019re all too busy blazing on weed like degenerates. We were raised on the internet and we\u2019re not gonna be cucked to anyone, unlike you shitty millennials. You are all entitled race mixers who watch cuck porn and dream of a united, globalist world run by niggers and jews. It\u2019s really sad to see the fact that so many of you were decedents of white people and you choose to sell out that heritage. Your generation is utter garbage and I can\u2019t wait until you all march into Russia and get cucked by Putin.","filename":"fuck millennials","ext":".jpg","w":460,"h":430,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":233,"tim":1492547632504,"time":1492547632,"md5":"Ka4JqKsignzCIa7DT9My5w==","fsize":80363,"resto":0,"id":"YDGg2MQz","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"millennial-hate-thread","country_name":"United States","replies":59,"images":8,"omitted_posts":54,"omitted_images":7},{"no":121743329,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)17:27:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"I hate being born in 86 and grouped in with millennial faggots.<br><br>Most people my age I meet are rightfully racist and right winged, especially since they&#039;ve seen the world before the internet made everyone start changing genders and becoming fags.","time":1492550825,"resto":121735809,"id":"55cDpkP+","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121743346,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)17:27:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121735809\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121735809<\/a><br>uh excuse me honey we killed bin laden saddam hussain and gadaffi try again sweety","time":1492550830,"resto":121735809,"id":"2\/EwK7Sl","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121743351,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)17:27:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121742805\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121742805<\/a><br>Wait for those high school girls to get to college and watch them change in the first few months.

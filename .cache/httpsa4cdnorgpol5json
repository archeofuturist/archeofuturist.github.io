Speer reports that &quot;Hitler had been much impressed by a scrap of history he had learned from a delegation of distinguished Arabs.&quot;[2] The delegation had speculated that the world would have become &quot;Mohammedan&quot; if the Berbers and Arabs had won the Battle of Tours in the 8th Century AD, and that the Germans would have become heirs to &quot;a religion that believed in spreading the faith by the sword and in subjugating all nations to that faith. Such a creed was perfectly suited to the German temperament.&quot;[3] Speer then presents Hitler&#039;s claims on this subject:<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Hitler said that the conquering Arabs, because of their racial inferiority, would in the long run have been unable to contend with the harsher climate of the country. They could not have kept down the more vigorous natives, so that ultimately not Arabs but Islamized Germans could have stood at the head of this Mohammedan Empire.[4]<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Similarly, Hitler was transcribed as saying: &quot;Had Charles Martel not been victorious at Poitiers [...] then we should in all probability have been converted to Mohammedanism, that cult which glorifies the heroism and which opens up the seventh Heaven to the bold warrior alone. Then the Germanic races would have conquered the world.&quot;[5]<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;According to Speer, Hitler stated in private, &quot;The Mohammedan religion too would have been much more compatible to us than Christianity.

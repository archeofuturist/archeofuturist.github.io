At first the Rhodes disciples thought that the Afrikaners would finish the job and exterminate the &quot;useless eaters&quot; in Africa as it happened in Australia, America, etc, but no. These Afrikaners were good Christian folk who built schools and universities for the useless eaters. They built houses, hospitals and employed the useless eaters. Under Afrikaners the useless eater population of South Africa increased four fold and the white countries of Rhodesia, South Africa and Namibia were feeding the rest of Africa. This was obviously a disaster for the &quot;useless eater&quot; proponents.

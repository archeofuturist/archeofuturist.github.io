From a pragmatic point of view, it&#039;s become ineffective to just toss whoever has problematic opinions in jail because modern technology allows ideas to be shared without having to make any sort of public demonstration. Take the homosexual concentration camps in Chechnya for example - we know about them and how the government is actively suppressing and murdering homosexuals within their country thanks to international LGBTQ+ organizations, whereas in World War II, we hardly had any idea of the Holocaust until we pushed into German territory, years after the process had began. For the modern day, the most profitable means of securing a national identity or mentality is through entertainment and mainstream media, but we already knew that. The only way to suppress other mentalities is to force it out of the light of the mainstream and relegate it to the fringes of society.

There are claims (albeit unsubstantiated) from Front National dissident groups that up to half of FN elites are homosexuals. Two FN Mayors put into power during municipal elections, Stephane Ravier and David Rachline, are also ethnic Jews. It should be noted that the first thing these Front National mayors did in power is vote themselves raises with the state money withdrawn from groups espousing pro-Palestinian views. Stephane Ravier carefully hid his Jewish roots when he joined the organization in 1995, but after being exposed in 2008 he had already gained considerable clout in the now reformed Zionist party.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;These factors have played an important role in transforming Front National from a nationalist alternative, into a one-track anti-Muslim party. Marine Le Pen\u2019s relatively low-profile meeting with the European Jewish Union vowing to crush \u201cHolocaust Deniers\u201d (like her father) and push the Zionist agenda in France. Front National\u2019s abysmal dismissal of the 1.4 million French citizens who filled the streets against gay marriage has led to a truckload of complaints from FN\u2019s grassroots organizations and voters, which Le Pen also tellingly dismissed.

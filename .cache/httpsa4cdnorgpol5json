Weed REALLY alters your perception to where you see the world on that subtle stage of perception that you always miss. You begin to perceive things that you NEVER perceived. Besides the mental effects...the pain relief, anti inflammatory, natural apostasy inducing action, neuron protective properties make it medical in nature. It&#039;s easy to see why so many people get addicted. It&#039;s virtually harmless. BUT with that said, the constant messing with brain chemicals such as dopamine, serotonin is not good for your mind. It can create imbalances and give you anxiety, or bring out any latent mental disorders, and imo this includes homosexuality and transgenderism lol. Once you keep smoking you become a weed dependent human who loses touch with reality and you start to become too much or an idealist and not pragmatic because you&#039;re just always high, always perceiving the world deeper than usual, and once you fall in love with that mental state, your brain won&#039;t be the same<br><br>TLDR smoking weed isn&#039;t degenerate but if you get addicted to it, it&#039;s degenerate","time":1493386041,"resto":123179548,"id":"aBUGzBAK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123195079,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)09:41:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123179548\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123179548<\/a><br><br>Notice the lack of even one shred of proof.

Ideally I would like a resurgence of Pagan traditions and Gods, but I believe in the current situation we are in, the chasm to achieve this is too large to cross in a single leap. Because of this, I feel Christianity is the only bulwark we have against the tide of degeneracy. Indeed, we must be welcoming to those other sects of Christianity, to bulk up our numbers. To stray too far and they will become fearful and resentful. <br><br>In the same way that Trump was memed to office, in similar regards, I propose we convert the normies to a better, stronger version of Christianity as created by us. I further believe there is fertile ground to do this and bring lost souls into the fray - even those who consider themselves atheists could be persuaded. This is not impossible in a religion. As many of you are aware, among the Jews there are atheists.<br>So what are some of the qualities this new religion needs? What have we learnt and how can we improve? Here are a few I\u2019ve started off with:<br><br>- The Pope has shown his cards and he is weak, so I guess we must be a protestant sect.<br>- We must be hard to differentiate to those who are Christians, and easy to signal to those who are tired of the ills of modern society.<br>- Need some kind of defence mechanism to use when we are inevitably called a cult<br>- Attractive to scientific thinkers and atheists and anyone who has concern with the errs of modern society<br>- I\u2019m not sure if it should be race related initially, but it should be nationalistic to at least postpone incessant immigration.<br>- We must renounce support of Israel?

The judge argued that in &quot;the mentality of the Turkish cultural circle,&quot; what the woman &quot;had experienced as rape&quot; might be considered merely &quot;wild sex.&quot; The judge refused to convict the rapist, because &quot;no intention is demonstrable.&quot;<br><br>According to the German daily newspaper M\u00e4rkische Allgemeine (forgive the weak translation from Google Translate), the judge told the woman, &quot;I believe Mrs. G. every word,&quot; but added that &quot;her tormentor probably did not know what he was doing to her.&quot; On the night of August 18, 2016, the 23-year-old Turkish man sold drugs to the young woman and they consumed speed together.<br><br>He asked her to &quot;go to bed with her&quot; and she refused. According to the report, she had said he was &quot;not her type.&quot; But the drug dealer forced himself on her. Here&#039;s how the paper described the encounter:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The young drug trader then complimented his customer, dragged her by the arm, threw her on the bed and pulled her out. He shoved his shoulders firmly against the metal bars at the head of his bed, his head jammed between two of them. The woman cried &quot;stop&quot; and resisted by scratching the accused at the back. But at some point she gave up and let her go as she put it. Several times he had entered her, the whole ordeal ended after four hours, when he got a call and suddenly had to leave, so that she too could go. <\/span><br><br>She refused, cried &quot;stop&quot; after he had grabbed her, and then finally she gave up. To most people, that sounds like rape. Indeed, the German paper reported that the Turkish man &quot;carried on the sexual intercourse for hours on end so badly&quot; that the girl could &quot;not run properly for the next two weeks.&quot;","filename":"1491796936130","ext":".jpg","w":853,"h":480,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1492850790320,"time":1492850790,"md5":"01xET8qXbSdy5lg7MB7WVQ==","fsize":90249,"resto":0,"id":"qOK9EDAh","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"german-judge-says-turkish-mans-forced-violent-sex","country_name":"United States","replies":32,"images":5,"omitted_posts":27,"omitted_images":5},{"no":122258092,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)05:23:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122256613\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122256613<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Msy<\/span><br><br>hahahaha shit tier image fuck you","time":1492852987,"resto":122255811,"id":"XpG2RLyF","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":122258343,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)05:26:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122258092\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122258092<\/a><br>butthurt papas faggot detected<br>go kiss nigger feet","time":1492853209,"resto":122255811,"id":"TGMBPdT4","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122258404,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)05:27:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122255811\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122255811<\/a><br><br>But what about &quot;No means no&quot;?","time":1492853261,"resto":122255811,"id":"uZXPzyH5","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":122258685,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)05:31:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122258404\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122258404<\/a><br><br>By being white you have given consent to get robbed for the extermination of your people inside Germany according to (((merkel)))","time":1492853496,"resto":122255811,"id":"NMWkQusT","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":122259105,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)05:38:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Luther<\/span><br>The Papists throwing a hissy fit for thirty years because Luther called out their Pharisee-type bullshit is not Luther&#039;s fault.","time":1492853880,"resto":122255811,"id":"2lHRlqUp","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":122251902,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)03:43:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Japan is more swedish than Sweden <\/span><br><br>you honestly cant make this shit up","filename":"Sweden_Hills","ext":".jpg","w":950,"h":632,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1492847036740,"time":1492847036,"md5":"jW3O8scfiMUiS\/IfmghpdA==","fsize":133087,"resto":0,"id":"+tom6IPX","country":"PH","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"japan-is-more-swedish-than-sweden","country_name":"Philippines","replies":50,"images":21,"omitted_posts":45,"omitted_images":18},{"no":122258505,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)05:28:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122253485\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122253485<\/a><br>J\u00f6nk\u00f6ping is the most religious place in Sweden.

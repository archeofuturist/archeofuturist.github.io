But I&#039;ll say it again: We&#039;ve been fucking up the carbon cycle on the planet ever since we started farming. The Middle East used to be a lot greener, but the goatfuckers have been using shitty agricultural practices for millennia. The Loess Plateau in China has been made barren because of shitty agricultural practices. Neither of these places have soil that is being built, and that means that there are two fewer carbon sinks in the world right there, and those areas were fucked long before modern ag. <br><br>It&#039;s estimated that something like 25% of what once was arable land has been fried in the past 10k years. Fix that, and we can probably pull enough CO2 out of the atmosphere to completely mitigate global CO2 emissions over the past 100 years. <br><br>We caused a lot of this mess with agriculture, but we can fix it with agriculture.

I see so little hope left. There must be lizard jews from mars that run this, nothing else makes sense. It&#039;s that retarded the level global politics have been these last 100 years, that lizard jews from mars are responsible for the demise of our habitat. All cause they was banished from leaving for enslaving us. <br>heh..<br><br>I remember one guy who basically just herded huge flocks of animals over areas over longer time periods in intervals, and it apparently had a very positive effect on the soil. Like their droppings and weight compacted the soil enough to give it back some nutrients to hold water and so after time you&#039;ll see results.<br><br>But! Who in their right mind would run a migratory farming operation where you need to bring along the food for the animals? The scale is sick, but so fucking possible. But profits! Pisses me off so much. Even China with 50 year plans don&#039;t commit to such a task as it gives so little back for a very long time. It&#039;d take over a decade to make the soil good enough to farm. And there is the question of scope, if it&#039;s to big, it might have ecological changes. Like more rain, that might create lakes now that the soil can hold water. Or flash floods from areas on the edge of of the trampled ground. <br><br>This is also another example of old practices being more sustainable. It&#039;s far from as profitable as modern farmhouse farming is. The only other way is raindeer farming, but that&#039;s not on bare ground, there is nutrients for the animals to eat in the tundras.

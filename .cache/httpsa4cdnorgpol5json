While checking out some usernames I found out that somebody is archiving (mainly) single comments on reddit that are kike related. Dissing israel, naming the jew, debunking the holohoax etc. Most archives are created within 24 hours of the post but I found some that archived 9 month old posts.

They started WW1, killing millions of whites, just because they were jealous of the British Empire. Rather comically, they lost the war and lost territory to the British Empire as a result of their ineptitude. Also, unbeknownst to many, the G*rman invented communism and spread it to Russia during the war to weaken them. Eventually, this would kill millions of whites. The G*rman, deeply consumed by shame and anger, sought to re-establish himself as a somewhat relevant regional power. To try and achieve this, they elected a socialist, who fought in the aforementioned war and held a great grudge against the Anglo. In his bitterness, the G*rman created lies about G*rman superiority, to try and justify his lust for power and his neighbours\u2019 lands. Thus war was declared, and with all too much predictability, the G*rman lost another war, with many millions of whites being killed. Again, comically, the G*rman had his own lands taken over by Anglos. The G*rman was defeated. For now. Many years passed, and under the divine mercy of the Anglo, the G*rman was allowed to rebuild, and even to thrive. But the seed of guilt had been implanted in the minds of G*rmans, so as to keep them weak. The G*rman, utterly humiliated, now put his hope in the EU instead of his conquered homeland, and in his autism invited the Middle East to Europe. This was done so that G*rmans could finally live beside a people lower than them. And so it was the G*rman&#039;s blood lust continued, as these new guests killed many whites. But alas, just as the G*rman began to feel a fell hope, the Anglos had defeated them again with Brexit. Who knows what the future holds, but there is one thing certain - the Anglo will always be here to thwart the G*rman menace.","filename":"germanball16","ext":".png","w":606,"h":630,"tn_w":240,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493841929697,"time":1493841929,"md5":"ZXi2CawDipiAyG114gcIGw==","fsize":165342,"resto":0,"id":"mFSDfSeS","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-truth-about-germany","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":22,"images":8,"omitted_posts":17,"omitted_images":6},{"no":123957587,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)16:22:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;british education<\/span><br><br>Germany did not start WW1 you fucking idiot.","time":1493842927,"resto":123955059,"id":"MuJyGzlr","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":123957640,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)16:22:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123957342\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123957342<\/a><br>Describe this alternate UN.

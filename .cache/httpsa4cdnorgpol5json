Although Auroville doesn\u2019t have a self-sustaining economy\u2014most Aurovilians either come in with savings or leave for a few months to work in their home countries\u2014Auroville has a lot of money. On top of the steep donations Aurovilians pay to become \u201cstewards\u201d of their houses, the Indian government donates tens of millions of rupees each year. As do private donors, and visitors when they come.<br><br>Where the money goes seems to be a central question, but whom to ask is maybe the better question. In lieu of a government, Auroville consists of spontaneous, self-formed committees that loosely run the place: Housing, Working, Women\u2019s Safety Task Force, Funds and Assets Management, Entry, International, Green Group, Board of Services. Beneath committees there are subcommittees and councils, startups and private groups, volunteers, and visitors. Elaine referred me to a group called the Unity Fund, but after several attempts to get in touch, no one would respond to my inquiries.<br><br>The government of India also employs a permanent \u201csecretary\u201d of Auroville, a man named Srinivas Martin, who agreed to meet with me. But an hour after I arranged the interview, I was contacted via email by the Media Centre and told that he was unavailable for interviews. Other groups, like the Working Committee, wrote a similar response to my inquiry: \u201cWe are too busy and unable to meet.\u201d<br><br>No one seemed able to answer the question of who controlled the funds; I was told to check the website, which has a child-friendly pie chart with the percentages of money donated.

I live in northwestern Ontario and the woods around here are full of crazies. All the fairy tales about deranged hermits and witches in the woods were created for a reason; to scare little kids away from the forest for their safety. It isn&#039;t wild animals they have to worry about. Wolfs can smell humans from a mile off so they avoid going anywhere near us unless its the middle of the night. Bears couldn&#039;t give to shits about humans unless we present ourselves as a threat. No it&#039;s a much smarter predator that lurks within the bushes...<br><br>Shit, the some of the first settlers in america were basically cults looking for &quot;religious freedom.&quot; The truth is they were mostly polygamous inbreed child fuckers, and they wanted to live someplace were they could get away with it...

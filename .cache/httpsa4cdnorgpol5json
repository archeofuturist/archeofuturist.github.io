Meanwhile, the younger subcluster, which they labelled N3a2, originated in south Siberia (probably in the Baikal region) approximately 4,000 years ago (Derenko 2007).","filename":"1482073127672","ext":".png","w":1956,"h":2024,"tn_w":120,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492429373389,"time":1492429373,"md5":"nIy0xTDaeKzvZ7l4k2ORYw==","fsize":952554,"resto":121513267,"id":"T9xM3yDZ","country":"LV","m_img":1,"country_name":"Latvia"},{"no":121516201,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)07:43:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121516096\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121516096<\/a><br>Northern","filename":"Untitled (2)","ext":".png","w":2280,"h":3260,"tn_w":87,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492429433434,"time":1492429433,"md5":"Fq8Sr1x4kAYIxNSrlBU3gA==","fsize":331151,"resto":121513267,"id":"ZyispUp0","country":"LV","country_name":"Latvia"},{"no":121516262,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)07:44:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121516122\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121516122<\/a><br>No","filename":"1490870289382","ext":".jpg","w":218,"h":321,"tn_w":84,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492429474478,"time":1492429474,"md5":"myM7LsaK6pnqKAyxKYVP2Q==","fsize":24691,"resto":121513267,"id":"ZyispUp0","country":"LV","country_name":"Latvia"}]},{"posts":[{"no":121509754,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)06:22:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"Who&#039;s \/ourguy\/ in this election?

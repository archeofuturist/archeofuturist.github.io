Distrust compassion; prefer dignity for yourself and others. Don&#039;t be afraid to be thought arrogant or selfish. Picture all experts as if they were mammals. Never be a spectator of unfairness or stupidity. Seek out argument and disputation for their own sake; the grave will supply plenty of time for silence. Suspect your own motives, and all excuses. Do not live for others any more than you would expect others to live for you.&quot; -Christopher Hitchens <br><br>(My favorite quote, because of its application in resisting the direction America is headed)","filename":"IMG_0157","ext":".jpg","w":300,"h":300,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491386832949,"time":1491386832,"md5":"haRTNtjms8UOj8+CJahTdg==","fsize":30472,"resto":0,"id":"kW0fbSKt","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"say-what-you-want-about-the-man-its-a-great-quote","country_name":"United States","replies":19,"images":0,"omitted_posts":14,"omitted_images":0},{"no":119592340,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)06:21:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"Shunning transcendance is annihilating yourself","time":1491387699,"resto":119591343,"id":"5IC+cJNg","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":119592392,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)06:22:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119592169\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119592169<\/a><br>Genuine sacrifice remove the self from suicide","time":1491387750,"resto":119591343,"id":"t2mFkPKJ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119592461,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)06:23:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119591343\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119591343<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; beware the irrational<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; poison your blood with cigarettes and alcohol<\/span><br><br>WEW LAD","time":1491387808,"resto":119591343,"id":"HCklV9Nu","country":"TR","country_name":"Turkey"},{"no":119592527,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)06:24:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119592240\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119592240<\/a><br>Kek<br><br>but honestly my edgy hitchens days are long gone. <br><br>But you have to admit that there&#039;s some truth behind this <a href=\"#p119591956\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119591956<\/a><br><br>In some ways I think Hitchens led me here","time":1491387860,"resto":119591343,"id":"kW0fbSKt","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119592698,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)06:26:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119592340\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119592340<\/a><br>No he&#039;s referring to transcendental ideology (like Thoreau) which sort of isolates you and stops you from competing in a sense","time":1491388011,"resto":119591343,"id":"kW0fbSKt","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":119579393,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)02:59:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"Does using linux mean you&#039;re a commie?","filename":"Tux","ext":".png","w":265,"h":314,"tn_w":210,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491375580358,"time":1491375580,"md5":"ftioCEIKQcyRr6Yjbnod1A==","fsize":11913,"resto":0,"id":"+jqfVpdn","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"does-using-linux-mean-youre-a-commie","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":76,"images":15,"omitted_posts":71,"omitted_images":14},{"no":119591925,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)06:15:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119579393\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119579393<\/a><br>Yes goyim, &quot;Free Software&quot; is for Communists.

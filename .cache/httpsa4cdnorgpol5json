If even we don&#039;t know what Trump is going to do, the rest of the world must be shitting themselves right now. Do you think Trump could get as far as he has and have done what he&#039;s done by accident? He knows what he is doing.<br><br>- He beat 17 cucks in the primary.<br>- He beat Crooked Hillary and the entire DC establishment in the general.<br>- He got a very right-wing cabinet confirmed.<br>- He exposed deep state spying and chased King Nigger into exile.<br>- Thousands of pedophiles have been arrested so far.<br><br>- He withdrew the US from the TPP.<br>- He&#039;s saved jobs at Carrier, Toyota, and many others just by setting a positive tone.<br>- He&#039;s rolling back King Nigger&#039;s regulations day after day.<br><br>- He&#039;s confirmed his Supreme Court justice.<br>- He instituted his temporary hiring freeze.<br>- He instituted a lobbying ban.<br>- He fired Yates, a bunch of federal prosecutors, and a bunch of people at State.<br>- He&#039;s making plans to cut many government employees and drain the swamp.<br><br>- He&#039;s deporting spics left and right.<br>- Border crossings are down to the lowest level in 17 years.<br>- He&#039;s taking bids and designs for the wall.<br>- His travel ban will be ultimately upheld now that he has the Supreme Court.<br>- He is already restricting H1Bs for certain jobs like programmers.<br><br>- He blew up a bunch of sand niggers with missiles.<br>- He convinced China to threaten North Korea for us.<br>- He insulted Merkel to her face.<br>- He&#039;s pissed off the eurocucks on many occasions.<br>- His budget proposal basically cuts all foreign aid to niggers.<br><br>Coming soon: the end of niggercare, lower taxes, the arrest of King Nigger&#039;s minions, and the end of shitskin immigration.

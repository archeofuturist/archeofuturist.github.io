Trump rightfully pointed out his superior genetics (can&#039;t remember the exact interviews, but he directed the interviewer to link his success in Jew York and his intelligence), and now that this has come out, many normal whites will now question the &quot;muh equality&quot; myth. Following this, you now have the kikes in the fake news who have to admit that Trump is more than capable to be in the office in terms of skills (though they will continue to attack him on feels) and would give the people who voted for him a platform.<br><br>2) This proves we memed 3D chess. Now, the (((MSM))) are not calling it that, but the fact that their language across the different articles now put Trump is a commanding in chief position AND that (((they))) are pointing out that he is indeed ahead of what the average kike thinks (as though alluding to maybe a better brain) is something that highlights his strengths. People are flocking more and more into the Trump train, and having a genius strong leader (the definition of Aryan) is something that is a complete victory for the Whites of America and our goals.<br><br>3) As a consequence of these two reasons, we can conclude that all this must have been predicted by Trump since the beginning\u2026 if he would have been a book writer, he would be those rare geniuses who are able to foreshadow multiple events across the book hundreds of chapters back!","filename":"ce59a81f21a107634b6394242e127c543645a664979a50d256af5c0742ade22a[1]","ext":".png","w":500,"h":402,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":201,"tim":1492421480264,"time":1492421480,"md5":"a53PFlPE\/Ur9tw83j\/T9ZQ==","fsize":127631,"resto":0,"id":"X\/nnxr0Y","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"we-memed-3d-chess","country_name":"United States","replies":21,"images":3,"omitted_posts":16,"omitted_images":2},{"no":121506857,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)05:43:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121506497\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121506497<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Bombing Syria got the whole media hard for him.<\/span><br>Demonstrably false.<br><br>There are no the_Donald rapefugees anymore.

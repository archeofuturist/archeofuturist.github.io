Waters to the House Ethics Committee for further review.<br>The ethics committee then established an investigatory subcommittee, eventually charging Rep. Waters with three counts of violating House rules and federal ethics regulations.<br>The House Ethics Committee scheduled Rep. Waters\u2019 ethics trial for November 29, 2010,but on November 19, 2010, the committee announced it would postpone proceedings indefinitely following the discovery of new evidence.<br>On the same day, the committee placed two attorneys, who had worked on Rep. Waters\u2019 case on indefinite administrative leave.<br>One of the attorneys had served as deputy chief counsel and lead attorney on the case.<br>News reports painted a picture of a committee in near chaos, with staff arguing over which documents should be subpoenaed, intimations that then-chairwoman Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-CA) had undermined staff efforts to prepare a fair and thorough case, and allegations the committee had failed to obtain and review clearly relevant documents from Rep. Frank and the staff of the House Financial Services Committee.<br>In March 2011, the new House Ethics Committee chairman, Rep. Jo Bonner (R-AL),denounced what he called a \u201cunilateral\u201d decision by Rep. Lofgrento suspend the attorneys and reinstated both, though neither chose to return to the committee.

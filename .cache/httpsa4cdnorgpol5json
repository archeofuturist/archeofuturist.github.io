When the mess began, it counted barely 10 functional batallion group. Now the number is reaching 70 well managed and well armed batallion combat groups which places Ukraine as an owner of the strongest land component in whole Europe except Russia. What if they have another Maidan, but this time anti-Polish and turn this shit against us?<br><br>Russian rules over all these Russian-speaking countries are the best guarantee that they will always be poverty-ridden, disarmed and completely not dangerous, deprived of any national ambitions and supplying Russia&#039;s, ours and Germany&#039;s economy with cheap slave workers. Russian power over them will cause that they will never receive any significant Western investments, wich will help keeping them in everlasting poverty and weakness.<br><br>Of course, we wouldn&#039;t want Russia to touch Poland, but i really doubt that Putin is stupid enough to march into Germany\/American influence zone so easily, packed with 300 bln dollar of direct investments, full of 40 mln of hostile people who don&#039;t speak Russian and have nothing in common with so called &quot;Russian world&quot;, especially now when we invest a lot in defence, buy American weapon worth billions dollars and build new levels of bilateral military cooperation with the USA - also partially independently from NATO.","time":1490529391,"resto":118352647,"id":"ATj2Jr7c","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118353448,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)07:43:50","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Supporters of Navalny hold rally against Medvedev and Putin","com":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/I2FhmpoHMiQ","filename":"\u043d\u0430\u0432\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439","ext":".jpg","w":580,"h":435,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":187,"tim":1490528630730,"time":1490528630,"md5":"+iYukod3oeJsnFzRJEQBXA==","fsize":43903,"resto":0,"id":"ZbGFPN\/v","country":"RU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"supporters-of-navalny-hold-rally-against-medvedev","country_name":"Russian Federation","replies":5,"images":2},{"no":118353914,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)07:49:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118353448\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118353448<\/a><br>Based Navalny will fix Russia","filename":"Russia-Emigration-062916","ext":".png","w":940,"h":901,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":119,"tim":1490528959524,"time":1490528959,"md5":"lamgqykuV9tpiL3h0gtshg==","fsize":391533,"resto":118353448,"id":"zdrRP9Z\/","country":"LV","country_name":"Latvia"},{"no":118354047,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)07:50:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118353914\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118353914<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;400k Russians emigrating <\/span><br>Christ, that&#039;s high, but where all they all moving too?

I am sorry to share it with you, but I really need to get it out of my head in the hope it stops bothering me so much because I don&#039;t want to see certain people in my life in such a bad light and maybe someone here can help. <br><br>As a bit of a background to how I came to these conclusions, you just need to know that I am currently majoring in mathematics and learning about quantum mechanics. As you probably know most forces in the universe can be assigned into two categories. At the most basic level, this becomes the positive and negative which can be restated in many ways, additive and subtractive, light and dark, hot and cold, expansion and contraction or most complexly creative and destructive. <br><br>The spiritual realm primarily focuses on separating creative and destructive forces with the ultimate metaphor annotated in the bible in the form of God and Satan, but Yin and Yang is another common metaphor used. If you look at these things not as necessarily objective reality, but as metaphors for the human condition each of those forces can be used to describe functions of the human condition.<br><br>I began thinking about how one can accurately recognize these forces in the human condition and how can one identify which part of the human condition is creative and which is destructive to strive towards creative rather than destructive endeavors. Is there any kind of mathematical proof that can back this up or is it all just a matter of personal opinion?<br><br>Enter my current study of Quantum Mechanics particularly as it pertains to Atomic and Electromagnetic Forces. As you are probably aware, the positive force of the atom is attributed to the subatomic particle, the proton, while negative force is attributed to the electron. In a simplified way at the quantum level, negative electron motion is associated with electron holes while positive extremes of electron motion are associated with magnetic poles.","filename":"Devil-In-Red-HUGE[1]","ext":".jpg","w":2100,"h":1608,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":191,"tim":1490168328080,"time":1490168328,"md5":"AnqZsVtCkj+\/87cFbGdrzA==","fsize":1930772,"resto":0,"id":"MRTiJngp","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"mathematical-proof-for-the-patriarchy","country_name":"United States","replies":33,"images":4,"omitted_posts":28,"omitted_images":2},{"no":117740800,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)05:01:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117735587\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117735587<\/a><br>You are sort of right, but just as positive and negative charges give balance to the universe, so men and women give balance to each other, though feminism has upset the equilibrium. <br><br>Listen to Jordan Peterson maps of meaning lectures on utube","time":1490173304,"resto":117735552,"id":"Wd6E1pw9","country":"HK","country_name":"Hong Kong"},{"no":117740889,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)05:03:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117740417\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117740417<\/a><br>Absent, just means not present which is basically the same as saying opposite.<br>Are you still admitting to be female is to tend towards destruction due to lack of creativity?","time":1490173396,"resto":117735552,"id":"MRTiJngp","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117741015,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)05:05:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117740417\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117740417<\/a><br>Thus yin and yang.","filename":"IMG_3303","ext":".png","w":225,"h":225,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490173526806,"time":1490173526,"md5":"78USbFnIZbrcn\/g9AIXK0w==","fsize":5296,"resto":117735552,"id":"Wd6E1pw9","country":"HK","country_name":"Hong Kong"},{"no":117741029,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)05:05:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117740800\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117740800<\/a><br>The universe is not balanced, though, it is in a state of constant unpredictable chaos such that even our greatest minds can barely even understand the small localized portion of it we occupy.","time":1490173542,"resto":117735552,"id":"MRTiJngp","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117742034,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)05:23:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117740417\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117740417<\/a><br>The Muslims are getting desperate.","time":1490174595,"resto":117735552,"id":"ERL\/Yc60","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]},{"posts":[{"no":117730458,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)02:28:15","name":"It&#039;s official","sub":"It&#039;s official","com":"So she&#039;s been redpilled.

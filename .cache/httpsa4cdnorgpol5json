At some point around here it was mentioned, &quot;that stupid roleplaying game&quot; which jack (i assume) played, the lawyer mentioned a few times that she does not play the game, it seemed as if she had her identity stolen by\/because of this game. At about this point the lawyer said something along the lines of &quot;you had better hope i keep talking to you or else you will have no defense&quot; which sounded as if other people were going to either Interrogate or do something to jack, who seems to be in a room\/court. she kept talking about the roleplaying game and she said that the game was real (no idea what is meant by this but it seems that the identities in the roleplaying game are real, also the roleplaying game seems to be related to pornography), she kept on talking about how stupid the game is etc... but now this next thing spooked me, im not sure whether i interpreted it wrong but it seemed like the lawyer said something along the lines of this &quot;julia gillard (among others i couldnt hear) is on that game&quot;----- CONT","time":1490956927,"resto":119044363,"id":"tacw2fOO","country":"AU","trip":"!!7x\/1T0S+vo8","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":119044771,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)06:42:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"----she said important people were on the game (among the &quot;other&quot; peoples names, some i recognized as other political figures but i forgot the actual names), and whether she meant just had identities stolen onto the game or were actually PLAYING the roleplaying game i am not sure. The next thing the lawyer was talking about was about the owners or creators of the game, she said that they were all psychopaths, and kept stressing that point, I believe she said there were 3 owners\/creators of the game, what i will write next is what she was saying about one of the (i think) creators. She said that one of the creators (female) was someone the lawyer vaguely knew (dont quote me on that), she almost seemed to talk favourably about this person. She said which (high?) school the game creator went to, which i dont think i should reveal just yet, but it may mean that she (the game creator\/owner) could be relatively young. The lawyer also talked about how the game creators were pedophiles(not sure if the she explicitly said this), she said something about them having a 6 year old (in game) but i couldnt hear the rest of what was said. the lawyer was also talking about the intelligence agencies being involved in this game somehow, intelligence agencies were mentioned about 3 times. Let me make it clear that she stressed the federal police, the department of defense, the department of security an awful lot. she also mentioned that the courts have all access to the roleplaying game (we already know this though). <br><br>i will try to answer any related questions, and there may be things ive forgotten that i will remember again, bear with me please.","time":1490956978,"resto":119044363,"id":"tacw2fOO","country":"AU","trip":"!!7x\/1T0S+vo8","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":119045509,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)06:54:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"The only game that comes to mind is Second Life.

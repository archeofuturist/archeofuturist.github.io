The company, which is still in the earliest stages of existence and has no public presence whatsoever, is centered on creating devices that can be implanted in the human brain, with the eventual purpose of helping human beings merge with software and keep pace with advancements in artificial intelligence. These enhancements could improve memory or allow for more direct interfacing with computing devices.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Musk has hinted at the existence of Neuralink a few times over the last six months or so. More recently, Musk told a crowd in Dubai, \u201cOver time I think we will probably see a closer merger of biological intelligence and digital intelligence.\u201d He added that \u201cit&#039;s mostly about the bandwidth, the speed of the connection between your brain and the digital version of yourself, particularly output.&quot; On Twitter, Musk has responded to inquiring fans about his progress on a so-called \u201cneural lace,\u201d which is sci-fi shorthand for a brain-computer interface humans could use to improve themselves. <\/span><br><br>https:\/\/archive.is\/VKs3T<br><br>http:\/\/www theverge.com\/2017\/3\/27\/15077864\/elo<wbr>n-musk-neuralink-brain-computer-int<wbr>erface-ai-cyborgs","filename":"7ee242bcb76893182c42e8ebe04820f5694dc2f5c9f02dec1880c66ed6644b31","ext":".png","w":935,"h":828,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":221,"tim":1490650119592,"time":1490650119,"md5":"cdR2r3FuMInqG73bKEN\/1A==","fsize":175380,"resto":0,"id":"JHniG4jB","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"elon-musks-new-startup-to-merge-human-brain-and","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":191,"images":30,"omitted_posts":186,"omitted_images":28,"tail_size":50},{"no":118578725,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)19:26:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118573268\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118573268<\/a><br>&lt;forced cnn stream <br><br><br>Now this is a real nightmare, hehehehe","time":1490657205,"resto":118564701,"id":"kex3yrWa","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118578754,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)19:27:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118578606\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118578606<\/a><br>Cyborgs can have kill-switches too.","time":1490657224,"resto":118564701,"id":"skf8VgBB","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":118578755,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)19:27:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"Now if he could only figure out how to make a profitable company.","filename":"1490021619938","ext":".jpg","w":450,"h":600,"tn_w":93,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490657224792,"time":1490657224,"md5":"ElEQusxXeccwsKflUoYvfg==","fsize":30515,"resto":118564701,"id":"5Au\/3+TN","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118578799,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)19:27:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"muh iron mann<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;greatest inventor of all time according to reddit<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;made website<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;didn&#039;t invent electric car<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;didn&#039;t invent rocket<\/span><br><br>this dude is as much of an inventor as Steve Jobs, as much of a scientist as black meme guy","time":1490657249,"resto":118564701,"id":"n1rDjrcf","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118578869,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)19:28:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"Let&#039;s hook ourselves up to a computer network that&#039;s increasingly used to control thought and freedom under the whims of an Orwellian A.I. system sold as enhancement","filename":"279ADE1500000578-3040405-Dr_Bombelli_said_his_inspiration_came_from_the_1999_movie_The_Ma-a-6_1429117959440","ext":".jpg","w":634,"h":418,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":82,"tim":1490657285492,"time":1490657285,"md5":"f74U\/kdTvbSjYBHHkxBlEA==","fsize":72083,"resto":118564701,"id":"EGcxKX6n","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118553450,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)15:58:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Be Macedonia<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Be 30 years old<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Claim to be Ancient Macedonians<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Actually a Slavic people <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Greek name<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Bulgarian genetics, Bulgarian language<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Build cheap statues of historical figures from Bulgaria and Greece, claiming them as your own<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Become laughing stock of the world<\/span><br><br>So, \/pol\/, how do we solve the Macedonian question?","filename":"Flag_map_of_the_Republic_of_Macedonia.svg","ext":".png","w":2000,"h":1571,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":196,"tim":1490644685820,"time":1490644685,"md5":"F8br6Hu8zTi94cyLDuS1iA==","fsize":124035,"resto":0,"id":"Z4g8QZPY","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"be-macedonia","country_name":"Canada","replies":120,"images":34,"omitted_posts":115,"omitted_images":32,"tail_size":50},{"no":118577992,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)19:20:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118577645\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118577645<\/a><br>Same here, the Show is called Orange, comes from Portugal.","time":1490656816,"resto":118553450,"id":"cxgek5+c","country":"AL","country_name":"Albania"},{"no":118578060,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)19:20:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118577261\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118577261<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Islam in the fastest shrinking demographic in Albania<\/span><br>interesting, provide statistics maybe?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;do you really think we could just tear down religious sites indiscriminately without causing a massive uproar and rise of radicalism?<\/span><br>that&#039;s because albanians are muslim though.

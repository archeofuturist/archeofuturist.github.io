The left organizes all their radical groups through NGOS and other ways. One thing I&#039;m wondering is why haven&#039;t the altright or conservatives actively engaged and joined forces with the HOTEPS? They&#039;re based and want what most conservative thinkers or right leaning people want. They want to sustain communities, grow food, have big government out of their business, stop all the wasteful spending to build up our country. They are NATIONALISTS and their movement is gaining members of the black community and are based\/woke. What are we going to do to engage? Groups like these need eachother. I was watching podcasts by conservatives and the left always attacks with &quot;racists&quot; to keep people away. Why don&#039;t big podcasts invite HOTEPS to get their message and &quot;our&quot; message out?

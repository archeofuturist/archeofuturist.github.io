Real smart guy, says this hurricane is bad, talks for half an hour and convinces my dad that we need to evacuate. Funnily enough, our house wasn&#039;t touched, we got back a month later and got everything before leaving. Except for the fridge, of course. The fridge was a real tragedy because we had just picked like 20 pounds of blueberries. You ever smell 20 pounds of rotten blueberries?

The hospital had one of those automatic double doors, and there was literally a foot of water slowly gushing in through it. <br>So, we run up stairs and by the end of the day, the water was up to the tops of the houses. I remember people talking about the hospital being completely fucked, and they had just put in a bunch of new equipment. I didn&#039;t check later, but I&#039;m pretty sure the hospital closed. My dad was pissed because he had just bought a new car (well technically used), it wasn&#039;t insured, and we weren&#039;t as well off those days. I&#039;m pretty sure the cell towers got fucked too, I remember everyone standing on the roof with their shitty little fliphones trying to get a signal. I roamed the upper floors of that hospital, I&#039;m sure I could draw a map from memory, but it would be a child&#039;s map: the dimensions all wrong. I can&#039;t remember what we ate, not sure if my parents packed or not. I did learn that you could make some great fucking balloons out of latex gloves.

As I said before, dropping the baby and having to dive after it was the running joke in the hospital. I was too young to distinguish between true or false, but I think it was true. We finally got on a boat and went to a prison which had been made into a makeshift hospital. I was shielded to this by my youth, but with the power failures and general trauma, I&#039;m sure a lot of patients died. So, I&#039;m following my dad running around this prison trying to administer medicine. Finally another boat comes, and I lose track of the number of boats at this time. I do remember riding along the tops of street lights. Waters been going down this whole team, and we get to a place where we get sweatshirts with the world new Orleans in pink lettering. I remember being torn between having this trophy and wearing something subtlety pink. I think it was just a gutted store that we were legally robbing, overseen by the police or whatever. I remember shelves. More boat rides. We finally get out, and I remember it being night. There were volunteering driving buses to shuttle people out of the city.

Six years ago, I would have called practically everyone here the enemy. The conditioning from years of public education and media indoctrination were strong. Oddly enough what broke it was the left&#039;s all out assault on firearms after Sandy Hook. The left had gone pretty much silent running on guns about the time the 1994 Federal Assault weapons Ban sunsetted in 2004. I got into competitive shooting about 2006. And being a nerd, I learned all I could about my new hobby. technical details of the firearms themselves, as well as all the laws surrounding guns, of which there are a lot. And aside from to occasional nutty outburst from the New York and California politicians, the left stayed quiet about guns. That all changed with Sandy Hook. I watched as people I believed lied their asses of about guns, gun laws and gun death statistics. And that made me wonder, &quot;If they&#039;re lying about this, what else are they lying about?&quot; See, I knew the Neocons and the Tea Partywere all lying sacks of shit, but somehow, I believed the Democrats were the good guys. Turns out, they just lie about different things. And once Obama got his second term and lost the Senate in 2014, he went full Social Justice retard, and that kicked it right over the edge. Cause when the party you thought had your interests in mind actually openly talks about your extinction being a good thing, well, time to get on the trump train, sister. Trump may be a lying sack of shit, but he&#039;s our lying sack of shit who plans to stick it to the flaming bag of dog shit that is the current Democratic Party. And that&#039;s good enough for me.

Afghan, Iraw, and Cablegate were all done by Black Cube under the direction of EJ. Then 2016 election season comes around knowing Hillary would continue Obama&#039;s policies it would eternally BTFO Israel if she won. That is when EJ and Black Cube hacked the DNC to end it. Remember how bad it was for Israel especially when Obama humiliated them in the last month of his presidency. <br><br>All this drama with WL is due to Black Cube being behind the curtain.

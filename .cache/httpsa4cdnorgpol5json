I live in a very poor state and in my area there might be like 2-3 small ones. <br>DESU its not worth it. The rent is close enough to actual apartment rent that for 100 bucks more you could live in something nice. If you shop around its worth it. Paying 150 bucks lot rent is hella cheap.","time":1493863903,"resto":123981552,"id":"Fl08LSLB","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124002703,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)22:12:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124001905\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124001905<\/a><br>LOL, SAD BUT TRUE!!!","time":1493863923,"resto":123981552,"id":"+hAR\/Rvx","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124002812,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)22:13:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123990406\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123990406<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;what happens?<\/span><br><br>detroit\/post-apocalyptic cities and crack houses.<br><br>and trailer parks become nice, safe places to live as a part of a community. maybe.","time":1493863983,"resto":123981552,"id":"Gb90+S7C","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"}]},{"posts":[{"no":123973340,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)18:10:23","name":"NORTH KOREA HAPPENING","com":"i suggest those on the left coast get your nuclear bunkers and your guns ready, oh wait you dont have any. to those in any big cities in cali, good luck being completely defenseless in a tightly confined metropolitan area with little to no water experiencing heavy drought when the shit hits the fan. it aint gonna be pretty for you guys.<br><br>https:\/\/www.thesun.co.uk\/news\/34616<wbr>65\/satellite-images-north-korea-bar<wbr>ge-long-range-missiles-us\/","filename":"SAM_2069","ext":".jpg","w":1696,"h":954,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1493849423902,"time":1493849423,"md5":"Wtdn4DYZf4VgaSfIX1ueEQ==","fsize":629834,"resto":0,"id":"QWQnPkGq","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"i-suggest-those-on-the-left-coast-get-your","country_name":"United States","replies":177,"images":53,"omitted_posts":172,"omitted_images":52,"tail_size":50},{"no":124000876,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)21:56:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124000372\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124000372<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Everyone laugh ITT at the retards<\/span><br><br>your english is a shit.","filename":"1480536569246","ext":".gif","w":488,"h":291,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":74,"tim":1493862960770,"time":1493862960,"md5":"hiOH0v3yCinNeuavpxdqSA==","fsize":3876093,"resto":123973340,"id":"RDJjfceo","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124002245,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)22:08:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123980847\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123980847<\/a><br>There&#039;s always military aircraft flying around that area, its by Edwards and China Lake.

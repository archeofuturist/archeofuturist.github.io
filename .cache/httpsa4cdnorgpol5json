The answer to that question is noone. You might think the elites might use it to rid the earth of their enemies and reduce population, but even for them this way of doing it a) causes to many side effects and influence on nature and b) has too many variables, since you can&#039;t be sure who nukes where and you can&#039;t plan the outcome good enough to be able to stabilize a new society afterwards.<br><br>I mean look at the war zones we have today, war isn&#039;t what it used to be and the war in those countries is neverending. In a land where the infrastructure is destroyed, economics don&#039;t exist anymore and people lost all good belief there will be only chaos. This chaos would last for at least some decades and again the outcome would be very unstable and hard to plan for.<br><br>Second we have to ask ourselves why everyone keeps their bombs then. This one is simple and you heard it before: So no madman can push the button without killing himself. And there is a second answer: You can use nuclear weapons on a smaller scale for tactical combat. Small rounds with nuclear parts that wreck a lot of devastation will come, will be in use and will not influence nature too much. You can predict the outcome. This is very dangerous and unsettling, but won&#039;t lead to an all out nuclear war.<br><br>And there there is someting else people don&#039;t think about enough: Having an all out nuclear war only occurs when it is clear who shot first. All scenarios are like &quot;A attacks B who is partners with C, they shoot back but A is partners with D and will retaliate.&quot; and so on. Have you ever thought about that the &quot;new&quot; nuclear danger is not countries nuking it each other, but CovertOps looking like terrorist action? If you are Putin you could easily set up a CovertOps of Pseudo-Terrorists getting a quite small bomb into NY for example. You could blow up the city, and the US could not react.","filename":"1491895215258","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":720,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1493797981930,"time":1493797981,"md5":"pRjhfHES9WqEZXiEPeEJLg==","fsize":61326,"resto":0,"id":"kv3GATkr","country":"DE","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"will-there-be-nuclear-war","country_name":"Germany","replies":66,"images":7,"omitted_posts":61,"omitted_images":5},{"no":123892025,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)04:47:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123891812\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123891812<\/a><br><br>they might plan to live underground for a long time. they might plan to live in space. russia has developed cobalt nukes<br><br>they aren&#039;t selling cobalt nukes to jihadists. just regular bomb-grade nuclear material<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I doubt muzzies could turn fissile uranium into a devastating bomb.<\/span><br><br>muzzies like Pakistan?","time":1493801247,"resto":123888374,"id":"q2wOzSEb","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123892151,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)04:49:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123891729\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123891729<\/a><br>actually they could activate your weak dna and made you a human zombie, oh wait.. anyway and made you a human zombie and you become a fearful jihad warrior and a syrian national hero","time":1493801348,"resto":123888374,"id":"HzE8lXTe","country":"PT","country_name":"Portugal"},{"no":123892362,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)04:52:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123891013\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123891013<\/a><br>That is something unconfirmed, therefore I can&#039;t say anything about it.

My husband knows my dedication to &quot;conspiracy theories..&quot; and has known this about me since we met.<br>Trusting in the fact that he usually listens to me when I research a new topic, I flat out said to him &quot;Holy shit, I don&#039;t think Hitler did anything wrong...He was just trying to save the people and stood up for his country.&quot;<br><br>The fucking look he gave me...<br>I quote, &quot;I don&#039;t care, what the fuck is wrong with you? I don&#039;t believe that. Dont get all white supremacist on me.&quot;<br>And I said something along the lines of &quot;if the jews control the media, don&#039;t you think they&#039;d control that narrative?&quot;<br>He replied &quot;I doubt it, I&#039;m cool with taking the blue pill.&quot;<br><br>I was pretty turned off.<br>I should have listened to \/pol\/<br><br>And yeah, I&#039;m a degenerate nigger for posting this. But I&#039;ll take the hate.","filename":"feels","ext":".png","w":2400,"h":2400,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493788220347,"time":1493788220,"md5":"edomFkDNVvHrgUeiC+kAkw==","fsize":230629,"resto":0,"id":"XCiqLYsX","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"i-didnt-listen","country_name":"United States","replies":102,"images":15,"omitted_posts":97,"omitted_images":13,"tail_size":50},{"no":123891796,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)04:44:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123875017\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123875017<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;He was just trying to save the people and stood up for his country.<\/span><br><br>which is like saying you&#039;re just protecting your family if your neighbor is keeping them up late with noise population so you murder him and his family and then force your family to die fighting all your other neighbors who try to stop you and then burn down your own house and kill yourself","time":1493801042,"resto":123875017,"id":"AHZuXpWt","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123891911,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)04:45:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123875017\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123875017<\/a><br>Homosexuality is a sin.","time":1493801147,"resto":123875017,"id":"59kn2Ccr","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123892053,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)04:47:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123891796\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123891796<\/a><br>fellow brit, germany could and should have done whatever it wanted with (((their))) problem, there was fuck all reason a silly drunk needed to take us into it.<br><br>churchill was a bigger all round cunt than hitler.","time":1493801263,"resto":123875017,"id":"pBsnmkld","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123892150,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)04:49:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"DO GIRLS EVER POST TITS ANYMORE?<br><br>The rules exist for a reason.","time":1493801347,"resto":123875017,"id":"KghuPVjz","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123892369,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)04:52:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123892150\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123892150<\/a><br>No. It should stay that way.","time":1493801531,"resto":123875017,"id":"z6yuSwtU","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}]}

Proto-Baltic is then thought to have split into East Baltic and West Baltic branches. However, more recent scholarship has suggested that there was no unified Proto-Baltic stage, but that Proto-Balto-Slavic split directly into three groups: Slavic, East Baltic and West Baltic. Under this view, the Baltic family is paraphyletic, and consists of all Balto-Slavic languages that are not Slavic. This would imply that Proto-Baltic, the last common ancestor of all Baltic languages, would be identical to Proto-Balto-Slavic itself, rather than distinct from it.<br><br>Finally, there is a minority of scholars who argue that Baltic descended directly from Proto-Indo-European, without an intermediate common Balto-Slavic stage. They argue that the many similarities and shared innovations between Baltic and Slavic are due to several millennia of contact between the groups, rather than shared heritage.","time":1492345684,"resto":121327004,"id":"uDmAIFlG","country":"LV","country_name":"Latvia"},{"no":121354118,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)08:38:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121352918\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121352918<\/a><br>if you&#039;d read up about the soviet russification of the baltics you&#039;d understand why calling it a conspiracy is retarded.","time":1492346338,"resto":121327004,"id":"313tTqRI","country":"LV","country_name":"Latvia"},{"no":121355227,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)08:52:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"Fuck Germany.

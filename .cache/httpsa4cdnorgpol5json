This idea that the Democrats are the part of non-whites needs to die for the good of non-white Americans. First off it feeds into the idea that the left wants to flood the country with non-whites that will vote for them regardless of what happens so that they can have a dependable voting bloc that they can use to stay in power. If this continues then my family and many of my friends will be seen as nothing more than the tools of criminals that seek to rape our country. Secondly the left wishes to make non-whites (and Muslims especially) a protected class. This is how tolerance dies. This is not asking for equality, this is asking for supremacy over the white man and I don&#039;t want this. When the white man&#039;s only two options are submission or hatred can you really blame him for choosing hatred? We must do away with hate crime laws and affirmative action so that we can have real equality. The killings of Sikhs by white men in this country will not stop when some blue-haired leftist tells rednecks that racism is wrong; it will stop when we are respected as equals and this can only be done by us doing good work and enriching the lives of all Americans by contributing to the arts and sciences.","filename":"Sikh of Islamic Terrorism","ext":".jpg","w":654,"h":875,"tn_w":186,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491187535748,"time":1491187535,"md5":"oJqCQ5+Ss2whsEDbiAaPWA==","fsize":120267,"resto":0,"id":"vv9DPQu4","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"how-do-we-end-the-democrats-stranglehold-on","country_name":"United States","replies":21,"images":1,"omitted_posts":16,"omitted_images":1},{"no":119283007,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)23:08:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119280967\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119280967<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;But that&#039;s objectively what they&#039;re trying to do.<\/span><br><br>Both sides are trying to do it because bringing in low skilled workers is how they want to generate wealth and stimulate the economy.

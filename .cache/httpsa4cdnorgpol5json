Sitting down with these people and speaking with them is good. As a christian i want to always understand my fellow man and get a firm grasp on why they went down this path. Christianity plays a big role in all of this since we are the people who made them. For Christianity to reach the ultimate end, it needs balance Agnostics\/Atheist are the doubters or non-believers which where throughout the bible.I dont believe these people are inherently evil or mis-guided, but i cant grasp living a life without faith.","filename":"1484259761199","ext":".png","w":900,"h":300,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":41,"tim":1490368387291,"time":1490368387,"md5":"ARonuHrJKKvGH30xwDkLPA==","fsize":68770,"resto":118085008,"id":"3L5IYNs4","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118076820,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)08:45:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"Search within your heart, you know it to be true.","filename":"shitstorm maker","ext":".jpg","w":800,"h":800,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490359513442,"time":1490359513,"md5":"yljgyc2Yi6mRFLrmqlrkWA==","fsize":87016,"resto":0,"id":"i6ZgzWHB","country":"IL","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"search-within-your-heart-you-know-it-to-be-true","country_name":"Israel","replies":175,"images":48,"omitted_posts":170,"omitted_images":46,"tail_size":50},{"no":118089287,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)11:06:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118076820\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118076820<\/a><br>Australia is Chaotic good.<br>Israel is chaotic evil.","time":1490368011,"resto":118076820,"id":"3oGvVCz0","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":118089303,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)11:07:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118076820\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118076820<\/a><br>fuck off kike","time":1490368021,"resto":118076820,"id":"xI2oi2m5","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118089641,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)11:10:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118088039\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118088039<\/a><br>immigration in us in the 1800s would be chaotic. giving them full furnished apartments and jobs is not. swedes are lawfultards and you know it.","time":1490368240,"resto":118076820,"id":"ZWP8oezI","country":"DK","country_name":"Denmark"},{"no":118089688,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)11:11:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118086190\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118086190<\/a><br>Made a few improvements.","filename":"14812124789142789124","ext":".jpg","w":800,"h":800,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490368272888,"time":1490368272,"md5":"lsAz\/yLHbfw0dFJtCtg3vQ==","fsize":99812,"resto":118076820,"id":"nbqJAlgU","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":118089872,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)11:13:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118076820\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118076820<\/a><br><br>America would definitely be one of the chaotic, definitely not lawful.

If you try to have a solar farm in the north of Canada, you won&#039;t have very efficient energy production.

In the context of stuff like this, i.e. food, no freedom of choice should not be taken away. It&#039;s not the pizza&#039;s fault people are fat and unhealthy it&#039;s theirs. I&#039;m not living in a country where the state watches over every facet of my life and decide what&#039;s best for me to consume, do, work, behave, etc. Anyone who genuinely asks &quot;should we ban x,y,z? XD I don&#039;t like it.&quot; Should go live in an authoritarian communist state and live in their utopia.","time":1491489482,"resto":119720218,"id":"ng7\/UKhT","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119748897,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)10:42:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119736339\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119736339<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Are you really willing to drive 10+ minutes away to dosh out the prices you see at Godiva shops for a chocolate craving?<\/span><br><br>I already buy spices I can&#039;t find in bumfuck super markets on Amazon, if I cared about chocolate I&#039;d do it too.<br><br>Speaking of which who here makes their own pizza?

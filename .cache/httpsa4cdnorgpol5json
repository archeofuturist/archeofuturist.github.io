This charge is well founded. The Communist philosopy was drawn up by Karl Marx who descended from a long line of Rabbis. His ideology of anti-Christian and Socialist thought is outlined in the Jewish \u201cTALMUD\u201d which is the \u201cbible\u201d of the Jews. Of the four political groups which overthrew the Christan Czar of Russia two were 100% Jewish. They were the Mensheviks and The Jewish Bund. The other two were the Socialist Revolutionary Party and the Bolsheviks. Both were headed by Jews but had some Gentile members. Today we now know that Lenin was Jewish and all of the leaders of his first government were Jews. They were Trotsky, Zinoviev, Kamenev and Sverdlow. The wealthiest Jewish banker in the world at that time, Jacob Schiff of Kuhn, Loeb investment bank of New York City, gave Trotsky and Lenin $20 million to overthrow the Czar and establish the Soviet tyranny (according to the \u201cNEW YORK JOURNAL-AMERICAN\u201d of February 3, 1949.)<\/span>","filename":"1484623946263","ext":".png","w":637,"h":1097,"tn_w":72,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490355315555,"time":1490355315,"md5":"ludTmL0+D8Xvi+31mkZSdQ==","fsize":177772,"resto":118054364,"id":"yVP5r5e0","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118072458,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)07:45:41","name":"Anonymous","filename":"1455045543006","ext":".jpg","w":722,"h":342,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":59,"tim":1490355941543,"time":1490355941,"md5":"rtHnBKf1q6h2d3pS+4gMZA==","fsize":260468,"resto":118054364,"id":"yVP5r5e0","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118073100,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)07:55:50","name":"Anonymous","filename":"1448918942070","ext":".jpg","w":1600,"h":1175,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":91,"tim":1490356550495,"time":1490356550,"md5":"+VK9\/xEHQyA\/lCjuSPY7GA==","fsize":365042,"resto":118054364,"id":"yVP5r5e0","country":"CA","m_img":1,"country_name":"Canada"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118068127,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)06:39:07","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Femi-nazi bitch trying to make her vid viral","com":"Looks like we have a femi-nazi running a campaign to get likes and comments on her youtube video. <br><br>Im tired of these nazi bitches thinking all white men are cunts, so outspoken that they make fucking music videos about it<br><br>see thread: <a href=\"\/mu\/thread\/71754659#p71754983\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;&gt;\/mu\/71754983<\/a><br><br>Here&#039;s the fucking video: <br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=E4A<wbr>cXEpr2yQ","filename":"test12","ext":".png","w":408,"h":416,"tn_w":245,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490351947640,"time":1490351947,"md5":"tti9Kn9aicEOG2vQsU5ttg==","fsize":77048,"resto":0,"id":"VGZSG6cY","country":"ES","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"feminazi-bitch-trying-to-make-her-vid-viral","country_name":"Spain","replies":14,"images":3,"omitted_posts":9,"omitted_images":2},{"no":118070433,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)07:15:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118068954\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118068954<\/a><br><br>This.

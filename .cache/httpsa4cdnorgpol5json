In particular, \/pol\/, the &quot;Politically Incorrect&quot; board, has been a central figure in the outlandish 2016 US election season, as it has often been linked to the alt-right movement and its rhetoric of hate and racism. However, 4chan remains relatively unstudied by the scientific community: little is known about its user base, the content it generates, and how it affects other parts of the Web. In this paper, we start addressing this gap by analyzing \/pol\/ along several axes, using a dataset of over 8M posts we collected over two and a half months. First, we perform a general characterization, showing that \/pol\/ users are well distributed around the world and that 4chan&#039;s unique features encourage fresh discussions. We also analyze content, finding, for instance, that YouTube links and hate speech are predominant on \/pol\/. Overall, our analysis not only provides the first measurement study of \/pol\/, but also insight into online harassment and hate speech trends in social media.<\/span><br><br>https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1610.03452<br>https:\/\/arxiv.org\/pdf\/1610.03452.pd<wbr>f","filename":"11906233_1661938980737600_1330127617_n","ext":".jpg","w":480,"h":480,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490771465969,"time":1490771465,"md5":"OEuOpn+b3Pn08jwliM9QbQ==","fsize":37964,"resto":0,"id":"udLRojoq","country":"EE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"daily-reminder-that-there-is-a-uni-research-paper","country_name":"Estonia","replies":137,"images":39,"omitted_posts":132,"omitted_images":37,"tail_size":50},{"no":118776704,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)07:41:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118764634\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118764634<\/a><br>you gosh darn idiot","time":1490787695,"resto":118759493,"id":"wCZHjhc5","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":118776935,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)07:44:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;hate hate racism prejudice hate hate speech harassment racism hate racism bad goyim alt-right<\/span><br><br>I&#039;m going to open this study, find at least one Jewish name and find further evidence for what I believe.","filename":"sheesh","ext":".jpg","w":393,"h":311,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":98,"tim":1490787858311,"time":1490787858,"md5":"KrCVd\/D+Rmfd20WYpFRO2A==","fsize":22081,"resto":118759493,"id":"12ebQxQ+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118777544,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)07:52:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118764406\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118764406<\/a><br>Friendly reminder that Denmark is a nice hateful country, surrounded by cucks.","filename":"1483624259184","ext":".jpg","w":4212,"h":2122,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":62,"tim":1490788337709,"time":1490788337,"md5":"eKhdVsO8F0V6VN9mRHdpug==","fsize":781382,"resto":118759493,"id":"IbKw\/Q\/1","country":"DK","m_img":1,"country_name":"Denmark"},{"no":118777862,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)07:56:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118759710\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118759710<\/a><br>We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children.","time":1490788569,"resto":118759493,"id":"\/tWW3YJI","country":"CL","country_name":"Chile"},{"no":118779115,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)08:09:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118759493\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118759493<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;This research<\/span><br>is supported by the European Union\u2019s H2020-MSCA-RISE<br>grant \u201cENCASE\u201d (GA No. 691025) and by the EPSRC under<br>grant EP\/N008448\/1<br><br>The fucking EU funded this shit","filename":"deadpol perplexed","ext":".gif","w":442,"h":402,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":113,"tim":1490789390001,"time":1490789390,"md5":"n4OJpKOXP9pr1gR5rdwlfw==","fsize":2105669,"resto":118759493,"id":"GQbx+W0x","country":"IT","country_name":"Italy"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118779102,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)08:09:38","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Milk has become racist.

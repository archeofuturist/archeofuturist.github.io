But now a research team out of the University of Toronto Mississauga (Ashlyn Swift-Gallant, Lindsay A. Coome, D. Ashley Monks, and Doug P. VanderLaan) has investigated variation within the population of gay men based on their anal-sex roles (that is bottom, or receptive, top, or penetrative, and versatile, or both receptive and penetrative depending on circumstance). The results of two of their studies suggest there very well could be biological subgroups of gay men, which is to say that one\u2019s biological makeup could possibly (and most likely, indirectly) influence whether or not he likes to fuck or get fucked (or both).<br><br>When it has been studied, anal-sex role has been viewed as a result of social factors (more on that in a minute). Despite every study I\u2019ve read that asks about the anal-sex role of its respondents has found that the majority men who have sex with men identify as versatile (including the two studies at hand from the University of Toronto team) as well as my own anecdotal experience suggesting as much, the top\/bottom binary persists in gay culture. It comes with predictable cultural baggage for those who firmly fit on either pole (pun intended\u2014but only for the bottoms). Tops are stereotyped as masculine, taking up the male tradition of putting their dicks in things, while bottoms are regarded as more feminine (despite the overwhelming evidence to the contrary in porn, and the preponderance of self-identified \u201cmasc bottoms\u201d in sex-app profiles). And with the assumptions of femininity in men come insults (\u201cbottom\u201d as a pejorative amongst gay men) and with those come a specific kind of shame in addition to the shame many gay men already experience merely living in a heterosexual world.","filename":"Screen Shot 2017-05-01 at 10.35.26 AM","ext":".png","w":1614,"h":1304,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":201,"tim":1493649500638,"time":1493649500,"md5":"s+KviB5VfcUMCUYUQRA9Aw==","fsize":2152567,"resto":0,"id":"h24dVcRW","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"science-proves-being-gay-is-genetic","country_name":"United States","replies":144,"images":18,"omitted_posts":139,"omitted_images":17,"tail_size":50},{"no":123635597,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)11:53:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123635460\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123635460<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;this isn&#039;t gay because it&#039;s girls underwear<\/span>","filename":"9cb79d30e1a8c74b2254153ca06dd5fdf53f2145e12d31fd395778fc7f084435","ext":".jpg","w":101,"h":126,"tn_w":100,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493654031434,"time":1493654031,"md5":"fQOUPTubHAU5xu3YaUHXew==","fsize":2067,"resto":123627464,"id":"uXLIGsB4","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":123635615,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)11:54:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123634887\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123634887<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;sorry, you must not know how evolution works.<\/span><br>Go look up kin selection.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Let us suppose that you carry a rare gene that affects your behaviour so that you jump into a flooded river and save a child, but you have one chance in ten of being drowned, while I do not possess the gene, and stand on the bank and watch the child drown.

If you try to save your first cousin once removed the population is more likely to lose this valuable gene than to gain it. \u2026 It is clear that genes making for conduct of this kind would only have a chance of spreading in rather small populations when most of the children were fairly near relatives of the man who risked his life.<\/span>","time":1493654041,"resto":123627464,"id":"7whD3QsO","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":123635902,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)11:56:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"Gay people can still have children.

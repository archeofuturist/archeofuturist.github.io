Because if you count that genocide you should also call every single massacre made in Africa and Americas by France, England and Spain genocides as well.<br><br>They weren&#039;t massacres made in order to prevent rebellions inside a 600 yo empire that is about to fall during a world war either. Those people were massacred because Europe needed more colonies.<br><br>Even if Turkey DOES accept that there was an armenian genocide, Turkey wouldn&#039;t be responsible for it as Turkey =\/= Ottoman Empire. In no way is Turkey responsible for anything that is done by the Ottoman Empire.<br><br>Tl;dr no shit the rating is 5\/10","time":1492493184,"resto":121636913,"id":"pKekbL+m","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":121636959,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)00:21:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;tfw no hitch to destroy the regressive left for their idiotic love for islamofascism<\/span>","filename":"hitchens","ext":".jpg","w":568,"h":346,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":152,"tim":1492489270263,"time":1492489270,"md5":"18\/XHABANzkSKJHsM5FZnw==","fsize":21555,"resto":0,"id":"vxEyGVGD","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"tfw-no-hitch-to-destroy-the-regressive-left-for","country_name":"United States","replies":34,"images":3,"omitted_posts":29,"omitted_images":3},{"no":121643339,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)01:20:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121642923\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121642923<\/a><br>I dunno, he just seemed lost and it seemed he didn&#039;t understand some of the terminology.<br>Granted, it&#039;s philosophical and a priori so Hitchens didn&#039;t really have much need to debunk it either way, but it still didn&#039;t look good.","time":1492492840,"resto":121636959,"id":"E0q\/ehPH","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121643542,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)01:22:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"Hey guys, here&#039;s a joke.

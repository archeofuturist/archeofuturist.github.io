I feel they are allowed to exist because they give people a way to take out their anger which makes them less likely to actually revolt and get violent.<br><br>I cant exactly articulate it, but i feel as though comfort is the source of most of the degeneracy around us. Just compare the great depression era generation to boomers and what has continued to come after them. Specifically i think about women and how different things are when the world is comfortable and easy vs when it is rough and they actually have to rely on men. Modern women are literally a byproduct of this shit.

The genie cannot be put back into the bottle, but even if it could, the majority of people dont even want it to be put back in because many people benefit from it.

Also this division of labor would apply to the government as well.

The frontrunners are goddess emperor Marine Le Pen and centrist beta cuck Emmanuel MACRON. If Marine Le Pen wins, she will liberate France from the globalists and crumble the EU. Macron will continue to give in to the rapefugees, and kneel at the feet of Merkel. We need to find anything we can on Macron, and ensure it is a victory for Le Pen. We need memes, scandals, fake news and anything that undermines Macron. If you don&#039;t speak french use translate, because this is a multilingual meme war now. This election could save europe, and pave the way for it&#039;s liberation. Remember- our candidate is Marine Le Pen.<br>First Round of the election- 23rd April 2017<br>Second round of the election, where the two highest polling candidates from the first round compete for 50%- 7th May 2017<br>VIVE LA FRANCE","filename":"FB_IMG_1487974791429","ext":".jpg","w":552,"h":503,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":227,"tim":1490444838195,"time":1490444838,"md5":"Fc1SDlixLp+cS+PjBOabBA==","fsize":26924,"resto":0,"id":"kcgZjth5","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"french-meme-war","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":118184760,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)00:22:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"With all these CIA\/NSA revelations and the ISPs to be selling my porn history in December I&#039;d like to know how I can get away from all this &quot;smart&quot; technology.<br><br>Seems integrated into fucking everything.

Being the first woman created by the gods, she was sent as a punishment. However, Pandora was not always despised as the bringer of evil.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Over the years, Pandora went from a revered goddess to the root of all evil, later to be conflated with other religions and immortalized in art and myth.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The earliest written myth of Pandora comes from Hesiod in \u201cWorks and Days\u201d, as well as his \u201cTheogony\u201d to a lesser extent. It is in these works that we see the first version of her as an ill-fated human that brought evil into the world. As the myth goes, she was the first woman created by the gods, Hephaestus and Athena at the request of Zeus. Zeus requested that she be made as a punishment to be unleashed on mankind, due to the transgressions of Prometheus, who had stolen fire from the gods and given it to man. Hephaestus molded her from the earth, just as man was created, but all of the gods gave her unique and seductive gifts<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;When Pandora was delivered to mankind, she brought with her a pithos (an ancient Greek vessel), later misconstrued as a box, which contained disease, pain, and various other evils that were released to the world. However, once the box was opened and Pandora saw all the evils fly out of it, she attempted to replace the lid, leaving one thing behind - hope. Thus, ended the Golden Age of man and the Silver Age began, in which man was not subjected to death. With the introduction of women came birth, leading to the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth.<\/span><br><br>http :\/\/www.ancient-origins.net\/myths-le<wbr>gends\/pandora-tale-good-girl-gone-b<wbr>ad-007773?nopaging=1","filename":"pandora","ext":".jpg","w":1200,"h":630,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":131,"tim":1490425136842,"time":1490425136,"md5":"GRutcnxw7iRYoL+Yt1ULkw==","fsize":51133,"resto":0,"id":"eEKySBL7","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"dude-the-greeks-had-it-all-figured-out-3000-yrs","country_name":"United States","replies":221,"images":20,"omitted_posts":216,"omitted_images":20,"tail_size":50},{"no":118218535,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)08:11:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118198125\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118198125<\/a><br>nothing is new under the sun lad","time":1490443903,"resto":118198125,"id":"g58yxG3y","country":"IT","country_name":"Italy"},{"no":118218740,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)08:14:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118218282\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118218282<\/a><br>We allowed women to vote and the majority always vote to the left, also we have liberal hell hole cities like Melbourne and Sydney who vote majority left too","time":1490444072,"resto":118198125,"id":"ESX0dtiS","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":118218906,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)08:16:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118218427\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118218427<\/a><br>and most definently a cis scum racist American trumpet kkk loving xenophobe!<br>no excuse me while I cry myself to sleep in my safespace (cuck cage)","time":1490444208,"resto":118198125,"id":"oP\/PjMlX","country":"IS","country_name":"Iceland"},{"no":118219518,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)08:25:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118218305\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118218305<\/a><br>The idea of &#039;hate crime&#039; is absolutely bollocks if it was applied evenly the law wouldn&#039;t exist as you couldn&#039;t prove what crime is concerned a &#039;hate crime&#039;.

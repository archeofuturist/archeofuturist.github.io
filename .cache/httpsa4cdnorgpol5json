Christian values had a better foothold in the populace. So there was a backlash against it and the traces of that still linger today \u2013 the word &quot;satanism&quot; evokes a gut response, a flinch reaction similar to words like &quot;racism&quot; and &quot;sexism&quot;, where people don&#039;t want to be associated with it (although not as severe). Because of this, people use the label to be cool and trendy, to go against the grain and spoop people out by LARPing as an occultist.

When any of their publications are outlawed and labeled \u201cextremist\u201d, Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses comply with the law and remove it from their places of worship and homes. However this does not stop the persecution. Russian authorities consistently plant evidence to falsely accuse them of breaking the law.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Step 2) Ban everyone from teaching the Bible outside their places of worship. Why did Russian authorities take this measure? The teachings of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses are found in the Bible, therefore the study aids they publish are not essential to their faith. As a result, the Russian authorities in their effort to protect the teachings of the Russian Orthodox Church, must resort to suppressing freedom of speech and pass laws banning evangelism outside of church<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Step 3) Ban Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, by labeling them \u201cextremists\u201d. This will effectively allow Russia to take over all of the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses\u2019 legally registered and established places of worship throughout the country affecting over 100,000 of their citizens. In doing so Russia would be able to criminally prosecute any members of the faith.

And the power of living is very rich and almost all millionaires, officials are terrible, and this despite the fact that the majority of the poor population.<br>4. disastrous climate. If you&#039;re not in the Sochi gotovsya to what 9 months of the year - winter and very cold winters, the temperature drops to minus 10-20 degrees Celsius, and it is very annoying.<br>5. Horrible architecture. All of these square blocks of flats is ugliness and squalor<br>6. No social assistance. Hospitals are terrible, small pensions, police terrible laugh and can not do anything even if you get beaten in the street.<br>7. Stray dogs. Because of stupid zoozaschitnikov stray dogs are caught and not if the was on the street nobody cares. These dogs get in packs and can bite people and even kill and nobody cares.

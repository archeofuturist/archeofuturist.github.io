Resources are finite, and therefore scarce, as is time. A good or service cannot be used exclusively by two people at the same time, and goods, once consumed, cannot be consumed again later. The only system that can prevent the conflict of 2 people thinking they own the same thing is private property acquired by either original appropriation or voluntary mutually beneficial exchange. People that refuse to understand this are a menace to society. If communists want to, they can start a commune somewhere and no one would bother them, but their system is too retarded to exist so they have to leach off capitalism, and push democracy and socialism on the ignorant masses. This is a million times worse then yelling fire in a theatre. Their goal is a one world communist government with a one world global bank that uses fiat fractional currency hebrew alchemy to run a perpetual monopoly.

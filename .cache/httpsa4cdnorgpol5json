It does not take into account enemy escalation, or the potential for large amounts of nuclear weapons to be unharmed. If they are, it implies a counterattack which by an enemy who will not be as courteous in it&#039;s discrimination of valid targets.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;You said we didn&#039;t test ICBMs, I showed you that we did. You then said that proves nothing because that wasn&#039;t us testing an interceptor. I then provided multiple articles showing every GMD test from &#039;99-&#039;16, and another article showing that we are planning on doing another test next month. How is that not proving you wrong? I have provided proof as to why you are wrong on every single instance.<\/span><br><br>You said we do it all the time. The article above says that it&#039;s only been physically simulated (a complete simulation) only once. Reread your article, because it&#039;s contradicting you pretty hard right now. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Thinking a Cessna is comparable to a KH102<\/span><br><br>And this is the amazing part. It&#039;s like you&#039;re trying to be ignorant. <br><br>Hold my hand:<br>If an enemy is launching a bomber that has long range cruise missiles<br><br>The bomber doesn&#039;t have to get close. The missiles have a range of 2700 nautical miles. <br><br>These missiles AND the bombers may very likely have plasma radome technology for enhanced stealth. Something you still haven&#039;t commented on. I&#039;m interested to see what you can teach me about cryptology and next gen radio technology, anon.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Again, size != role. If I use a 1Mt bomb on a battlegroup, it is still a tactical weapon.<\/span><br><br>And this is the crux of the argument. KH102&#039;s primary target&#039;s are civilian population centers. Kh101&#039;s (the non-nuclear variant) are designed to knockout hardened silo&#039;s if they have to. Kh102&#039;s are purpose designed for strategic attacks.","filename":"arguing with pigeons","ext":".jpg","w":403,"h":470,"tn_w":107,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491584829451,"time":1491584829,"md5":"MakxxszCCfBBlQ3eHWzjfA==","fsize":39065,"resto":119946424,"id":"YoHk8nN\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119983815,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)13:11:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119981859\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119981859<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Strategic bombing does not win wars.<\/span><br><br>Sounds like you&#039;re a fan of the Anglo-American air force leadership of ww2. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Unfortunately you don&#039;t have enough weapons to kill an entire country.<\/span><br><br>Are you kidding?

Bank of Cyprus is a front for Putin and Russian Oligarchs via 10% ownership, Dimitry Rybolovlev and that its known to be where Russian Billionaires stash their money.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Rybolovlev purchased Maison de L&#039;Amitie from Trump for $95 million, after Trump paid $41 million for it four years earlier. To some this might seem like a savvy real estate deal \u2014 however, in the context of the vast money laundering schemes involving Deutsche Bank, Russian Billionaires, and New York Real Estate, followed by Trump&#039;s immediate repayment of a close-to-default $50 million dollar loan to Deutsche Bank, it looks like a money laundering scheme to get money out of Russia, and in to Trump&#039;s hands. At this point, Trump became inextricably compromised by Russia. This is why he won&#039;t release his tax returns - it will reveal the extent of his current liabilities and who owns them (hint: it&#039;s Russians)<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Rybolovlev also owns MKATE \u2014 a plane which made about 25-30 stops in bizarre airports around the US throughout the Presidential Campaign; suspicious since these are places a Russian billionaire has no business going and almost always overlapping with the presence of Trump&#039;s 757. The secret: it was for Michael Cohen to move in and out of the country without record of transit. There&#039;s also a second set of planes that took Cohen&#039;s family around the world that also overlap with MKATE and would allow for surreptitious travel.<\/span><br><br>cont.","filename":"1485827836453","ext":".png","w":554,"h":618,"tn_w":224,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491262260243,"time":1491262260,"md5":"\/Dm\/hGPs+\/WOWKMrkksPrw==","fsize":119513,"resto":0,"id":"fbJ9bkPs","country":"AU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"insider-information-on-trump-investigation","country_name":"Australia","replies":65,"images":23,"omitted_posts":60,"omitted_images":21},{"no":119409253,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)21:10:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119408471\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119408471<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;lel here a baby I&#039;m hardcore :^)<\/span><br><br>Go back to \/b\/ little one.","time":1491268222,"resto":119398013,"id":"wP29ZUGP","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119409488,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)21:12:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"mediocre shitpost thread from mediocre shitpost country<br><br>know this OP, if ever a leaf wanted to they could create a bullshit Russian info shitpost that made this look like babies first time crawling across the fucking keyboard","time":1491268336,"resto":119398013,"id":"hKUd3B7v","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119409489,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)21:12:16","name":"Hope You Have A Strong Stomach","com":"<a href=\"#p119409253\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119409253<\/a><br>Im just warming up","filename":"Feminist","ext":".jpg","w":1030,"h":1100,"tn_w":117,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491268336604,"time":1491268336,"md5":"yAbHH2p+xE1bp\/nKXzJbWg==","fsize":704529,"resto":119398013,"id":"4WKwSgVc","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":119409569,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)21:13:03","name":"How does this make you feel?","com":"Does it make you hungry?","filename":"How the fuck was the cut so clean","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":375,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1491268383395,"time":1491268383,"md5":"8uVoO8w9XGrsapoF1YYfMQ==","fsize":32086,"resto":119398013,"id":"4WKwSgVc","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119409693,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)21:14:00","name":"What does this mean?","com":"<a href=\"#p119409253\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119409253<\/a><br>Look women, where they belong :)","filename":"Piked Up","ext":".jpg","w":253,"h":199,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":98,"tim":1491268440241,"time":1491268440,"md5":"LGCpdjKxFwrh6zNJtq7rTA==","fsize":7906,"resto":119398013,"id":"4WKwSgVc","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}]}

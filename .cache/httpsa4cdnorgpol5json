Look promptly at the Urinal. See that round mint floating there in what looks like residue piss? Go ahead and grab that and place it directly under your tongue. Its the latest progressive trend and everyone is doing it! The real high doesn&#039;t kick in until you go look in the mirror. Go ahead take a nice long look. After you have fulfilled your homosexual desires fucking bash your god damn head into the sink repeatedly until the mint under your tongue begins to taste like a black-cock foreskin.","filename":"1490979449282","ext":".png","w":2000,"h":3235,"tn_w":77,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491236812806,"time":1491236812,"md5":"nwcJH6OQyYxl1+nap0k\/SA==","fsize":149585,"resto":119343711,"id":"f\/n5kOas","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":119342732,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)11:55:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;meet perfect girl on paper<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;says her dream is to be &quot;stay at home mom and wife&quot;<\/span><br><br>Is this a good thing, \/pol\/?

If you want to have your children not screwed over by the state or lack of love by their parents, you need to have on of them at home.

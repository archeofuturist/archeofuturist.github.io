This blatant anti semitism also makes my blood boil. I asked him about the death camps and he became silent. I told him he must share his experience otherwise his story would be lost forever. He was born in Poland and the Nazis took him and his wife&#039;s disabled black son and put them on the train where they survived for four months by drinking each others urine. Once in the camp system each had a tattoo. My grandfather chose a tribal design while his wife&#039;s son went for numbers, which was the trend at that time. They were showered, fed and clothed. Luckily, both survived the gas showers because they both had heavy colds, and my grandfather told of how blocked noses saved their lives that day. In another camp, they stayed for seven days, but fortunately the green smoke meant that that week was Albanian gypsys being cremated. How fortunate for them that the smoke was not purple. They escaped from seventeen death camps in total. It turned out that my grandfather was 10\/10 at escaping, but 0\/10 at not getting recaptured. At his final camp, Auschwitz, they told him that if he worked hard they would set him free. He did, and he was set free in 1938. He told me that the Jews feared the showers at Auschwitz. It was not because gas came out of them, oh no, it was because they would get warm and comfortable, and without warning cold for a minute, and then warm, and then cold again. The Jews hated this above all else. I am glad that my grandfather shared these stories with me, otherwise how would I have known that he died 157 times.

I&#039;ve heard that some guy on \/pol\/ is starting some &quot;blue shirt&quot; club. <br><br>First off Antifa now stands for Anti Free Americans. They are the new KKK. Just like the old KKK. They are white democrats. They are communists. They wear hoods. They hide their faces with masks. We will meme this to the masses so when Antifa goes to cities blacks and other minorities will lynch them in the street. We will not be &quot;blue shirts.&quot; We will do as we always have and hide our power level. We will call ourselves the Free Americans since AntiFA stands for Anti Free Americans AKA the ones who want to bring back slavery. Lets turn the tables on these fascists fucks. This guy who said we should call ourselves blue shirts and wear black ties tucked in thought that would make us not look like Nazis. OK fucker lets call ourselves the blue shirts instead of brown shirts??? We shouldn&#039;t have a consistent uniform. We will wear either solid red, white, or blue color shirts with an American flag patch sewed onto it. That&#039;s the fuckin uniform. We are the Americans or the Free Americans and we fight the communist, new KKK, anti American, racist, Anti Free speech, pro slavery group that calls themselves Antifa. <br><br>https:\/\/m.liveleak.com\/view?i=9bc_1<wbr>492995052","filename":"IMG_1416","ext":".png","w":722,"h":373,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":129,"tim":1493350644522,"time":1493350644,"md5":"BeJ0MeZ89pEbH1vbJJmc5w==","fsize":604614,"resto":0,"id":"vDlKKEv0","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"does-antifa-relize-that-they-are-the-fascists-my","country_name":"United States","replies":52,"images":8,"omitted_posts":47,"omitted_images":8},{"no":123149271,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)00:50:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123148932\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123148932<\/a><br>Not an arguement<br>Just because your brainlet mind fails to comprehend complete political theories doesn&#039;t mean it&#039;s irrelevant<br>Stay mad normie","time":1493355037,"resto":123140313,"id":"Zi\/\/bUNr","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123149408,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)00:51:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123148876\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123148876<\/a><br>You bring down Antifa by continuing to allow them to chimp out, and filming and talking about it.

I am simply trying to capture as much of what my inner monologue\/thoughts are on a subject, as quickly as I can, and as fast as I can get them out. I have an extensive history of concussions and a possible but unknown insult to brain when I was deprived and extremely low on oxygen for about 4 minutes during an pulmonary embolism. I NEVER \u201ccoded\u201d or needed full blown CPR for anyone who is curious and knows far more than me on the subject. (Like note taking or openly brainstorming) This called mental vomit<br><br>- I wanted to make this point so nobody thinks I\u2019m just flippantly ignoring netiquite. I\u2019m not. I\u2019m going through a personal experience I just cannot explain in a way I think anyone will understand. When I try to come up with an explanation the only words my mind comes up with is, \u201cPure Understanding.\u201d<br><br>- This is NOT a \u201cLARP\u201d in what I think is 4chan \u201cspeak.\u201d I have taken the policy of when it comes to trying to find answers on this, to think in the now and be completely honest because I\u2019ll never get anywhere TRUE if I\u2019m not being honest. A lie can spark a lie and I VERY MUCH want to avoid that.<br> <br>- **STRONG URGE** to write \u2013 \u201cCareful this could be what you fear as fulfilling purpose and you\u2019re about to die.\u201d - Is this just my imagination or is that thought real? The urge to FINISH THIS PORTION is overwhelming and overcoming<br><br>- I make ZERO claim I am \u201cin contact\u201d with anyone about any of what you will read. I am simply a stay home father who has been so out of financial necessity since daughter needs so much care and we don\u2019t trust home nurses except for one.

There are millions of people fleeing war and famine from many middle eastern countries who are in urgent need of refuge. Western nations have the land and resources to shelter these people, and under normal conditions these people would be accepted into our societies. However, many working class people in the West don&#039;t want to let these people in. Why? Many will say that they don&#039;t want refugees because of the economy or because of unemployment and some genuinely feel this way. Others have more prejudice reasons. Racism and Islamophobia to name a few. As much as my heart goes out to the working class of developed nations, they are not in need. The refugees are in need. The way I see it we have a serious moral dilemma here. If we listen to the public: millions will die. The other option is to ignore the public, suspend our constitutions and force the people to let the refugees in. As much as it pains me to say this. We need to suspend democracy in order to save the people it exists for!","filename":"syrian-refugees","ext":".jpg","w":615,"h":410,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1493487321230,"time":1493487321,"md5":"LK9xXZC2JfulbTUdAazr9Q==","fsize":133310,"resto":0,"id":"mrpEyVw6","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"moral-dilemma","country_name":"United States","replies":30,"images":10,"omitted_posts":25,"omitted_images":8},{"no":123360533,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)14:09:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123356648\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123356648<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;We need to suspend democracy in order to save the people it exists for!<\/span><br><br>TIL American democracy existed for Middle Eastern Islamists.

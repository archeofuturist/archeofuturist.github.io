Here&#039;s why.<br>1.China&#039;s 2016 GDP Annual Growth Rate was merely 6.8%, meanwhile China Inflation Rate (CPI) was 2% and the devaluation of China&#039;s Yuan to US dollar was about -6.8%, which means China&#039;s GDP actually decreased 2% in 2016 if we use US dollar to measure it.<br>you can watch the vid in that thread if you don&#039;t believe me &gt;&gt;<a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/119449928#p119449928\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119449928<\/a> <br>2.

Finally, the elephant in the room - China&#039;s housing bubble. The size of housing market in China is about 240 trillion, and China&#039;s GDP is 65 trillion (using Chinese yuan), that&#039;s almost 400% of its GDP. The burst of the bubble will make the 2008 US subprime mortgage crisis looks like a fairy tale. All the elites in China are going overseas to buy houses trying to avoid the inevitable hard landing of China&#039;s economy.<br>My most optimistic estimate for China&#039;s collapse is in 2021, only 5 years ahead.<br>Feel free to ask me any questions, I will try my best to answer with facts only.","filename":"China_Hard_Landing","ext":".png","w":809,"h":409,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":126,"tim":1491317694608,"time":1491317694,"md5":"WyLyrUR7ARLm\/+qjM4go9w==","fsize":172995,"resto":0,"id":"ZXNo+\/XX","country":"DE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"redpills-on-china","country_name":"Germany","replies":6,"images":0,"omitted_posts":1,"omitted_images":0},{"no":119477817,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)11:06:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119476682\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119476682<\/a><br>I&#039;m thinking about teaching English just east of Xi&#039;an to travel while I&#039;m still 24. 2 years NEET.

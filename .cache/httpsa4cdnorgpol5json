I got out of university with useless diplomas, but self taught me coding and photoshop. I did some jobs for web designers. I wrote a book and corrected\/co-authored another one. I inherited a small piece of land from a family member and i sold it for a good price. I sold everything i didn&#039;t needed and invested it in wall street when things were going great in the 2000&#039;s. I got scared by how insane it was going up and pulled out actually too early, around 1 year and a half before it crashed. I bought gold with it. I got scared when it went so high and sold it when it hit 1100$ per ounces i think. Stupid from my part cause it kept on climbing.<br><br>I invested in safe stuff with secured small % interests and bought a shitty house. I renovated it myself and put it on rent for a nice monthly income. I live on family land from dad, and get income and free food from farm. I don&#039;t work hard, cattle and plants take care of themselves here. I have really low level of expenses, so what i earn is enough to sustain me, without hitting the capital. I loose a little due to inflation, but the value of lands goes up, so in the end, if i have a real problem i can always sell some assets.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Pic of old stone temple that is the heart of all the polynesian culture.

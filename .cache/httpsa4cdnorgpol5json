Jon Stewart completely changed the direction on the show to be political propaganda and anything that made fun of the left was slowly quashed out. Writers, staff, comedians would not get air time if they made fun of the left. It was not brain washing but it was propaganda. It billed itself as making fun of politics but especially political news BUT it would always got really hard on the right and go extremely light on the left. Stewart did this from the very beginning.","time":1493590050,"resto":123509660,"id":"IXvfOeRv","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123534498,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)18:08:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123533039\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123533039<\/a><br>SNL was always trash, but you know things are bad when the world is taken over by bad SNL knockoff propaganda.","time":1493590125,"resto":123509660,"id":"uVhsAxNB","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123534807,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)18:11:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;123534606<\/span><br><a href=\"#p123509660\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123509660<\/a> (OP)<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;smug liberal problem<\/span><br>Here is the video link for OP<br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=2au<wbr>awHMdzzs","time":1493590278,"resto":123509660,"id":"aVn6yjps","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123534918,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)18:12:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123510568\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123510568<\/a><br>It&#039;s worse that her, her husband and the other rich parents of her children&#039;s school fought to keep black kids out of that school.","time":1493590334,"resto":123509660,"id":"k4yiwvAd","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123535038,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)18:13:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123509660\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123509660<\/a><br>Remember when she mocked the cancer kid?","filename":"1490239073745","ext":".gif","w":658,"h":800,"tn_w":102,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493590391234,"time":1493590391,"md5":"w5uuvH19sgDY\/CLae052fQ==","fsize":2660214,"resto":123509660,"id":"2xgjgKOM","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":123535033,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)18:13:08","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Karl Marx","com":"What the hell...

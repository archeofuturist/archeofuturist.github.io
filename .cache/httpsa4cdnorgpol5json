A few months ago George Clooney made a PROPAGANDA movie about them. They are funded by the US, UK, France, and other western governments, but claim to be &quot;nuetral&quot; and there to help. They essentially make fake videos and sometimes kill people beforehand then film themselves trying to &quot;save them&quot;. They were behind many of the viral photos\/videos that the MSM has tried to push to get people against Assad. The kikes in Hollywood just gave an Oscar to this propaganda film about them. An organization of Swedish doctors have gone after them after watching their videos and noticing they are not performing any standard medical procedures and appear to be harming and even killing the people they&#039;re supposed to be saving. There are multiple Syrian accounts of the white helmets seen working for the terrorists and killing innocent people.

And we&#039;ve seen in the debate how retarded she can be sometimes. I&#039;ve often thought that there isn&#039;t any reason why a woman couldn&#039;t be a president, but now I&#039;ve completely changed my mind. We need a real leader, not a mother. But don&#039;t get me wrong, Macron looks like an absolute pussy. His voice is like that of a 14 y\/o kid and he is a granny fucker : he is absolute garbage and his program is inexistent. But if Le Pen gets elected, in 5 years the french people will surely be disappointed in the National Front, and given how many of them already dislike the party, they will without a doubt vote again for stupid new-comers like Macaroni who claim they can and will change everything.<br><br>Now in the West, we have two choices at the end of this huge mess : we either keep those niggers, mudslims, gooks and other filths in our countries, or we kick them all back to their shitholes.<br>With Macron elected, the disdain and distrust for politicians will rise considerably, and with his stupid program the hate for immigrants will slowly grow, and get more cemented in nationalist minds.<br>Right now we still have too many people who doesn&#039;t realise the problems immigrants are causing,a dn the threat they represent to our civilisation. Nationalists have to be a majority, otherwise it will still be a shitfest on the political scene for a long time.

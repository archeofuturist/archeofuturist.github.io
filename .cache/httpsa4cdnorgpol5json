This thread is for gathering all currently available memes showing the irresponsible reporting and outright lies propagated by CNN. This thread is also for the creation of new memes about CNN from the most recently available material. Once created we spread these memes. Once these start appearing on the Zuckbook feeds of angry Boomer normies we can hope to see the Boomers begin to do what they do best - which is complain. Over time, we need to have CNN turned off in as many public places as possible. Some well crafted memes posted to the local dentist or doctors office with a question as to why they still play CNN could work wonders.","filename":"170226132128-how-trump-turned-fake-news-into-a-slur-00021929-full-169","ext":".jpg","w":1600,"h":900,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1491359179514,"time":1491359179,"md5":"jYw6BxiS16c2IARAthO+lw==","fsize":208548,"resto":0,"id":"WEc64uTp","country":"CA","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"cnnmwg-cnn-meme-war-general","country_name":"Canada","replies":140,"images":65,"omitted_posts":135,"omitted_images":65,"tail_size":50},{"no":119569289,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)00:57:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119560815\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119560815<\/a><br><br>it already began. a three university&#039;s &quot;study&quot; came out with oxford university as the centerpiece stating that russian bots were everywhere in a strategic offensive aimed to support trump. <br><br>problem is that they were unable to acquire reliable geolocation information... and get this, the definition of a bot is someone who was tweeting\/retweeting pro trump messages fifty times or more in a day during the final debate and the days of the other debates. <br><br>that&#039;s what the finest minds came up with. everyone you and i know are russian bots.

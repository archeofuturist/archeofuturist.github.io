The case was said to reach &quot;the highest levels of the Republican party&quot;. A documentary about the scandal, Conspiracy of Silence, was listed in the TV guide to air on the Discovery Channel in May of 1993 but was mysteriously pulled without notice at the last minute.<br><br>While the courts ruled that the entire case was a &quot;carefully crafted hoax,&quot; there&#039;s plenty evidence to suggest otherwise. Two of the plaintiffs (Alisha Owen and Paul Bonacci) served time in prison because they refused to recant their testimonies while two other plaintiffs (Troy Boner and Danny King) recanted, supposedly under FBI pressure. Another victim, Eulice Washington, refused to recant but served no time. Paul Bonacci was later awarded $1 million dollars in civil court by a judge who believed his allegations of abuse.<br><br>The victims were able to describe rooms of the White House in great detail and matched alleged travel dates with airline receipts. There were several mysterious deaths of key players, such as the explosion of a plane carrying Gary Caradori, private investigator for the plaintiffs. All of his records were promptly impounded by the FBI.<br>http:\/\/spotlightonabuse.wordpress.c<wbr>om\/2013\/05\/02\/tim-tate-on-the-makin<wbr>g-of-the-franklin-scandal-documenta<wbr>ry-conspiracy-of-silence\/","filename":"IMG_4293","ext":".jpg","w":1011,"h":1005,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":248,"tim":1493315747227,"time":1493315747,"md5":"+SdeQQI8hkIAN21B369cTg==","fsize":233320,"resto":0,"id":"IaNihOGU","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"cia-government-pedophila-franklin-scandal-general","country_name":"United States","replies":7,"images":1,"omitted_posts":2,"omitted_images":1},{"no":123068212,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)14:34:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"you need memes my dude","time":1493318050,"resto":123063838,"id":"Ah0TQW9t","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123068908,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)14:39:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123068212\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123068212<\/a><br>I know!

While I am a proponent of equality, the simple fact of the matter is that women and men are not built the same. Women sometimes need outlets to express their frustrations, and their male partners are often appropriate means to vent those feelings. Men take it because they are not just a woman&#039;s partner but a sort of &quot;stress-ball.&quot; Furthermore, this actually helps the relationship, since the woman is now calmer and happier and, by extension, the man, because his spouse is naturally the source of his happiness. When she&#039;s happy, everyone&#039;s happy.<br><br>However, a man cannot do the same. Men are heavier, bulkier, and physically stronger. When a man hits a woman he can cause serious harm, and often is done less for reasons of improving the relationship than simply being aggressive. When men get aggressive they are violent.

If a man can provide an outlet for womens&#039; pent-up aggression, why shouldn&#039;t they?

Since then, I&#039;ve been enthralled and enlightened by some of the cool dialoguing going on here. I&#039;ve noticed a bit of a fallacy in the dialogue though and as an outsider it&#039;s been really sharp to me. How can you guys hate on Israel when it&#039;s by far the most based country. Let&#039;s look at the facts:<br>1. Strong against Muslims<br>2. Democratic with liberty and justice for all<br>3. Strong military<br>4. Lot&#039;s of entrepreneurs like Trump<br>5. Strong culture and history<br>6. Pretty traditional women<br><br>We sort of lose credibility as a movement when we deride Israel due to our emotions. I&#039;ll admit for the first week or so on \/pol\/ I started to question Israel but after think things through it seems the facts are settled on the matter.<br><br>Everyday at 9PM Est I&#039;ll be hosting \/IST\/ so we can better learn about Israel and it&#039;s contribution to the based world like America and Europe. Anti-Israelis will be kicked from the thread or muted.","filename":"Report-US-Israel-ready-to-clinch-largest-American-security-aid-deal-in-history","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":400,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1493773107847,"time":1493773107,"md5":"UM9upqARjjgweLnaSEsxKA==","fsize":50734,"resto":0,"id":"luo+fvaQ","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"israel-support-thread-ist-general","country_name":"United States","replies":209,"images":84,"omitted_posts":204,"omitted_images":82,"tail_size":50},{"no":123865720,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)23:36:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"i thought israeli jews were supposed to be cool and its the diaspora that are huge fagets","time":1493782569,"resto":123847823,"id":"pB4Yv1aV","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123865922,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)23:37:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123865463\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123865463<\/a><br>He also said that the strong should rule over the weak as the rule of Darwinian natural selection dictates and then lost the only war he ever started in such a manner that the faggotry echoed through the generations and probably will destroy europe.","filename":"1489548619342","ext":".jpg","w":468,"h":412,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":110,"tim":1493782672079,"time":1493782672,"md5":"9pfAhRMHOm+n4JtiD+EdPw==","fsize":33617,"resto":123847823,"id":"0Rq4i36y","country":"IL","country_name":"Israel"},{"no":123866046,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)23:39:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123865463\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123865463<\/a><br>&#039;The star of David steadily ascended as the will to national self preservation declined&#039;","time":1493782746,"resto":123847823,"id":"t955kG0V","country":"NZ","country_name":"New Zealand"},{"no":123866214,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)23:40:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"Fuck off with your Synagogue of Satan bullshit you MAGA hat wearing transexual spicy based nigger cunt.<br>You JIDF le Donald faggots are an abomination.","time":1493782834,"resto":123847823,"id":"xoiYjcmR","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":123866487,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)23:42:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123865922\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123865922<\/a><br>&#039;The strong must dominate, and not mate with the weaker&#039;<br><br>Nothing wrong with it.

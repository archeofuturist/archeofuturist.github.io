If Trump gets mired down in another open ME war, he&#039;s finished. I&#039;m beginning to think that&#039;s why (((they))) have let him win. It doesn&#039;t look good when it&#039;s a Dem invading a country, but it&#039;s ok for them to continue it (see Bush and Clinton, Bush and Obama). They wanted this war for a long time, but they didn&#039;t want it to be backed by the left. <br>As it is, Trump will invade, you&#039;ll see gorillions of leftists on the streets with peace signs, he will quit before the year is over and be replaced by some empty suit neocon Republican who will then be replaced by another hopey changey lib in 2020 (probably a woman for &quot;peace&quot;). <br>Syria will become Iraq 2.0 and the steady supply of rapefugees will never dry up.","time":1491497839,"resto":119758549,"id":"zZWXimLk","country":"AT","country_name":"Austria"}]},{"posts":[{"no":119762733,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)12:56:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK","filename":"Capture","ext":".png","w":632,"h":314,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":124,"tim":1491497766786,"time":1491497766,"md5":"NqHf\/TSJlpdGzIwhheTEjA==","fsize":40291,"resto":0,"id":"fyEfz1rc","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"fuck-fuck-fuck-fuck-fuck-fuck-fuck-fuck-fuck-fuck","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0},{"no":119762883,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)12:57:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119762733\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119762733<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;UN<\/span><br><br>Everyone knows the UN is useless.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Genocide in Rwanda<\/span>","time":1491497834,"resto":119762733,"id":"chGi\/YOS","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]},{"posts":[{"no":119751706,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)11:12:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"Sorry children, Nunes just stepped down.","filename":"where-are-all-the-trump-supporters-who-said-that-anybody-17270690","ext":".png","w":500,"h":522,"tn_w":239,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491491555994,"time":1491491555,"md5":"a+J1SnHPztDBPieMql4\/xw==","fsize":86318,"resto":0,"id":"SAysnTpI","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"sorry-children-nunes-just-stepped-down","country_name":"United States","replies":62,"images":9,"omitted_posts":57,"omitted_images":9},{"no":119758920,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)12:24:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119755406\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119755406<\/a><br>That&#039;ll feel more pricks than a 2nd hand dart board.","time":1491495842,"resto":119751706,"id":"WC\/nwvMq","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119759147,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)12:25:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119755059\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119755059<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;progresstribune<\/span><br>You going to link a creation science website to give me information about dinosaurs next?","time":1491495952,"resto":119751706,"id":"G3rEJGcd","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119760230,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)12:34:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"SEND IN THE GOWDY.","filename":"trey-gowdy-irs-commissioner-koskinen","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":371,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":77,"tim":1491496488166,"time":1491496488,"md5":"lvFe\/zLaU\/axm2qhRQ+vwg==","fsize":55171,"resto":119751706,"id":"Jh1QNV85","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119760642,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)12:38:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119758801\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119758801<\/a><br>Get a load of this guy.<br><br>Activists filed allegations.

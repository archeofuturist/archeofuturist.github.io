They went as far as organizing racial purity safaris where top SS members would tour the inner valleys of Norway to look at what a true pure-blooded aryan should look like. Their idea to raise the purity in germany was to simply import large groups of norwegians, swedes, danes and dutch to live and breed with aryan germans, creating the new blonde, tall and pure aryan race the SS&#039; envisioned.<br><br>It is important to note the difference between the average talk of the \u00fcbermensch from the NSDAP and the more romantic\/far fetched talk of the \u00fcbermensch from the SS. As a group the SS was essentially the NSDAP on steroids. Hitler of course had an ambivalent relationship with the SS, but it is clear that for large parts of the NSDAP\/SS it wasnt just about looking aryan (or rather non-slavic) but to both be racially pure in blood, mind, spirit and soul. The idea of aryanness was much more complex than most people think, it wassnt a question of blue eyes and blond hair. It was a quest for the na\u00efve natural leaders (aryans) to defeat the mongrel jewish masses. In essence an underdog story where finally the natural (genetically determined) leaders of the world would finally take back what was rightfully theirs.<br><br>When norwegians joined the waffen SS, their german instructors were ordered by Himmler to not use force, shouting and brutality to get them prepared for military life and battle. They were (in Himmlers eyes) already natural leaders (&quot;petty-Kings&quot;) and their fighting spirit and viking nature would emerge by itself and a simple (lowly) german officer had nothing to say or do regarding this-- It was inevitable. And in Himmlers words, Aryans (unlike germans) had not been beaten into a collective submission, and they would therefor not react well to the spartan methods that worked on the german soldiers.","filename":"himmler","ext":".jpg","w":2830,"h":4211,"tn_w":168,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490912254055,"time":1490912254,"md5":"jzV8EwuNA2GRPhZQA1uFSw==","fsize":1874875,"resto":0,"id":"bKa0SNTB","country":"NL","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-ss-calculated-that-the-german-people-had","country_name":"Netherlands","replies":24,"images":8,"omitted_posts":19,"omitted_images":7},{"no":118979913,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)18:38:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118977080\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118977080<\/a><br>This is a Jewish talking point.

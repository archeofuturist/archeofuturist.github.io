From February to March 1952, more bulletins reported disease outbreaks in the area of Chorwon, Pyongyang, Kimhwa and even Manchuria.[3] The Chinese soon became concerned when 13 Korean and 16 Chinese soldiers contracted cholera and the plague, while another 44 recently deceased were tested positive for meningitis.[4] Although the Chinese and the North Koreans did not know exactly how the soldiers contracted the diseases, the suspicions soon shifted to the Americans.[4]<br><br>On 22 February 1952, the North Korean Foreign Ministry made a formal allegation that American planes had been dropping infected insects onto North Korea. This was immediately denied by the US government. The accusation was supported by eye-witness accounts by the Australian reporter Wilfred Burchett and others.[5][6]<br><br>In June 1952 the United States proposed to the United Nations Security Council that the Council request the International Red Cross investigate the allegations. The Soviet Union vetoed the American resolution, and, along with its allies, continued to insist on the veracity of the biological warfare accusations.","time":1493876482,"resto":124018203,"id":"351rbWaO","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124025850,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)01:41:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124025809\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124025809<\/a><br>In February 1953, China and North Korea produced two captured U.S. Marine Corps pilots to support the allegations.

The Germans planned to slowly but surely replace Christian universalism with racial consciousness, and the vision to create the best possible people you can on the individual and collective level, creating a new breed of supermen over generations. I think this is taking the findings of a conscious perspective of history and science, and then applying it to mankind to make a new type of person that is more rooted in the reality of what we have here, the evolution that has come before us and brought us to where we are now, rather than religious dreams.

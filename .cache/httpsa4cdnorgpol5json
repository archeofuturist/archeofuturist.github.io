But all it does is confuse your brain. Can you operate machinery on shrooms? Can you even talk to your parents? No, you&#039;re in an unstable frame of mind and you&#039;re seeing shit. It&#039;s a distraction and doesn&#039;t redpill you on anything except maybe how easy your brain is to reconfigure into a babbling child. I know some of you will be offended by this since you thought you discovered the redpill to end all redpills on your last DMT trip, but all it did was confuse you and never provided any meaningful, hardcore TRUTH to your experience, just altered state of consciousness.","filename":"1488939373382","ext":".png","w":500,"h":628,"tn_w":199,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492002260535,"time":1492002260,"md5":"hOS6IZA2FwlixUtztaX7Cg==","fsize":102161,"resto":0,"id":"HlKEIceE","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"drugs-are-not-redpilled","country_name":"United States","replies":6,"images":1,"omitted_posts":1,"omitted_images":0},{"no":120754031,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)09:17:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120753811\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120753811<\/a><br>nigger that was 44 pounds of cocaine","time":1492003061,"resto":120752832,"id":"H4N3dLmb","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120754208,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)09:19:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120752832\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120752832<\/a><br>i have a question<br>if i ever have to amputate my own leg should i get really high on heroin first?<br>i heard that it is pretty good for when you need to concentrate","time":1492003175,"resto":120752832,"id":"HL0tzy7u","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120754503,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)09:22:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120752832\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120752832<\/a><br><br>Pic related.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; &#039;intoxicants&#039;<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; &#039;social lubrication&#039;<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; &#039;sip a glass&#039;<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; &#039;whiskey&#039;<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; &#039;discuss politics&#039;<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; &#039;cordial setting&#039;<\/span><br><br>Just from OP&#039;s language, you can tell he&#039;s never been out on a Friday night, sunk a few, and gome home with an 8 or 9.","filename":"O P ","ext":".jpg","w":675,"h":1200,"tn_w":70,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492003363019,"time":1492003363,"md5":"RAm\/Kb\/kIEp3JKP0emT+zg==","fsize":103733,"resto":120752832,"id":"PvtJQFxR","country":"AU","m_img":1,"country_name":"Australia"},{"no":120754727,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)09:24:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120752832\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120752832<\/a><br>you&#039;re a faggot retard, nice picture you really understand what you&#039;re talking about","time":1492003496,"resto":120752832,"id":"6ayXAPNf","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120754869,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)09:26:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120754208\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120754208<\/a><br>Well I was given fentanyl when I had a car crash a few years ago.

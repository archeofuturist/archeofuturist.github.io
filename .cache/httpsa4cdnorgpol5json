Everybody is being labelled a shill nowadays, and it&#039;s hard to even think clearly, nevermind participate in post-Ron Paul \/pol\/, nevermind post 2016 election. Believe it or not, \/pol\/ is not one person. One of the main reasons I supported Trump was his non-interventionist, anti-globalist, America First policy. Shooting missiles over a few dead kids violates that, in my opinion. While I&#039;m not dumping Trump, I will always support my beliefs over any personality. Lately I&#039;ve been fearing that I was essentially voting for Bannon, not Trump. And now Kike Kushner, who I don&#039;t know if he has a real position in the cabinet, seems to have a more influential position than our actual secretary of state. The nose knows, I guess. <br>I&#039;ve always believed that actions speak louder than words as well. Trump spoke of politicians being all talk and no action, and now we see him close to stepping in the moccasins of Bush, Hillary, and Obama. My support is behind Trump for now, but I&#039;m starting to get skeptical. He is a politician now, and power corrupts. He seems to be willing to betray his voting base to make everybody else happy. If you watch old Can&#039;t Stump the Trump videos or have attending one of his rallies irl and felt the energy, things are definitely much different now. I was a Rand supporter until July 2015 where I hopped onto the Trump Train. Has he lost his energy? This is a very conflicting time for me and I&#039;m sure for others as well.

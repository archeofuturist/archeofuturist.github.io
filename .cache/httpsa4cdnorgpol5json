If I were in circumstances that demanded the consumption of meat and animal byproducts, I would do so, but I have the option not to. <br><br>Meat may provide you with lots of protein but you don&#039;t actually need that much, let alone the fact that animal protein is acidic. In order to digest it your body takes calcium phosphate out of your blood, uses the phosphate to neutralize the acid and gets rid of the calcium through urine. Hence the widespread occurrence of osteoporosis. In addition, you&#039;re eating fat and getting excess cholesterol, because you&#039;re body produces all the cholesterol that you need. <br><br>Dairy is even worse. Full of hormones, estrogen, and the shit they pump into cows. Cow milk is meant to grow a calf into a full-grown bovine; the only milk that we need we get from our own mothers. Plus, the alternatives (soy, almond, cashew milk) have more calcium and minerals than regular dairy milk. <br><br>And then there is the ethical side of the argument, which most people do not care about. However there is something to be said about the estrangement between consumers and what they consume: odds are that if people worked in slaughterhouses they&#039;d have a different view of what they put into their mouths. People who have grown up in agrarian\/rural communities know that meat is a luxury, and that usually you have some kind of relationship with the animals you might eventually eat. But just like Apple sells iPhones by way of an inspirational marketing campaign, the meat, dairy and fast food industries mask the reality of their practices with humor, caricatures of animals, and clever slogans, because they really are purveyors of death and slaughter, they do not care about our health.","time":1490733728,"resto":118649405,"id":"qo9y2Djt","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118693771,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)16:43:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118693577\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118693577<\/a><br>walnut milk is the new new","time":1490733821,"resto":118649405,"id":"a1Ifr6Pe","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118677853,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)14:23:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;there are people on this board who would report her to the ICE just for being undocumented even though she is an upstanding member of society with a job and just wants to finish her education<\/span><br><br>Admit it, you&#039;re all just edgy racist white supremacists that would get a girl like this deported just for some &quot;lulz&quot;","filename":"436473hf","ext":".png","w":1198,"h":885,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":184,"tim":1490725421295,"time":1490725421,"md5":"44zzzIItjZmVaIMYjKAcyA==","fsize":282325,"resto":0,"id":"l4imP7tt","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"there-are-people-on-this-board-who-would-report","country_name":"United States","replies":133,"images":14,"omitted_posts":128,"omitted_images":14,"tail_size":50},{"no":118693511,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)16:41:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118677853\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118677853<\/a><br>They sneak into our country then want us to pay for their education.

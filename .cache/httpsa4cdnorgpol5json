Liberals say &quot;proven&quot; elements of it couldn&#039;t be written by trolls and that Russians wouldn&#039;t have been murdered and arrested for providing the info if it was all fake.<br><br>Also I&#039;m aware of the actual troll excerpts on \/pol\/ about anime porn movies or some shit which isn&#039;t actually in the dossier, because I actually read the whole fucking when I thought it actually said that.

So really who even cares if some hookers peed on a bed.<br><br>That aside, I&#039;ve scoured the internet for information about elements like Kalugin, and it seems more likely that the dossier was correct on that guy.

Maybe McCain is the first to blame. Possibly even Flynn depending on what you read.<br><br>So what the fuck am I supposed to think? How can you counter shilling to this degree?

We had just lit the candles to celebrate the Sabbath when an SS officer and a Greek policeman burst into the house. They told us we should get ourselves ready for a big trip.&quot;<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The 85-year-old slides the sleeve of his shirt up and uncovers his left forearm. The number 182558 is tattooed there in dark-blue ink.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The transport to Auschwitz took two weeks. His sick father died on the journey. Upon arrival, they had to strip and submit to an inspection. Ganon&#039;s mother and five siblings were then sent to the gas chambers.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Yitzhak Ganon was taken to the Auschwitz-Birkenau hospital, where Josef Mengele, the so-called &quot;Angel of Death,&quot; conducted grisly experiments on Jewish prisoners.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Ganon had to lie down on a table and was tied down. Without any anesthetics, Mengele cut him open and removed his kidney. &quot;I saw the kidney pulsing in his hand and cried like a crazy man,&quot; Ganon says. &quot;I screamed the &#039;Shema Yisrael.&#039; I begged for death, to stop the suffering.&quot;<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;After the &quot;operation,&quot; he had to work in the Auschwitz sewing room without painkillers. Among other things, he had to clean bloody medical instruments. Once, he had to spend the whole night in a bath of ice-cold water because Mengele wanted to &quot;test&quot; his lung function. Altogether, Ganon spent six and a half months in the concentration camp&#039;s hospital.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;When they had no more use for him, the Nazis sent him to the gas chamber. He survived only by chance: The gas chamber held only 200 people.

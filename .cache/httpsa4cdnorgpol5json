ENOUGH OF THESE MUSLIM SCUMBAGS<br><br>After they gave notice in February 2015, Alabi says he bent over backwards to accommodate the Egyptian-born couple in booking acceptable times to show their apartment to prospective new tenants. At first, Madkour tried to argue that the landlord couldn\u2019t show the unit when his wife was home. Alabi explained that with 24 hours notice, the law gave him the authority to enter even if she was there.<br><br>They called the police, claiming that his shovelling snow outside their apartment was harassment. The officers confirmed that Alabi was legally allowed to show their unit when they were there. That\u2019s when they suddenly raised the religion issue, he says, and told him he couldn\u2019t enter during their prayer times. He agreed.<br><br>That still wasn\u2019t enough, Alabi says.<br><br>In addition to the 24-hour notice, and the prayer times, they also wanted him to text in advance. But when he texted them, they didn\u2019t reply - so he stopped.<br><br>And then there was the issue of removing his shoes. At the tribunal, the couple said they prayed in their bedroom and the floor had to remain clean. Yet Alabi claims the couple never had a problem before when he wore his shoes to make repairs in the apartment. And he wasn\u2019t wearing outside shoes, but the shoes he wore in his own home.

For that, he was accused of being racist.","filename":"(((macleans)))","ext":".jpg","w":501,"h":676,"tn_w":185,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493908772548,"time":1493908772,"md5":"7Y8q4\/CiU0AnLCo7xS07NA==","fsize":37112,"resto":0,"id":"v5pTvSH0","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"canada-is-a-muslim-country","country_name":"Canada","replies":39,"images":13,"omitted_posts":34,"omitted_images":10},{"no":124076246,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)12:23:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124065860\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124065860<\/a><br>Tbh I thought canada was a exterior territory of China.","time":1493915019,"resto":124065860,"id":"fvvldzpA","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124076335,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)12:24:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124076246\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124076246<\/a><br>The chink owns everything from Vancouver to Saskatchewan.

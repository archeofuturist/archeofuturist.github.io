Most of Polish farmers found other markets to replace Russian one, but they didn&#039;t want to burn bridges, because sanctions don&#039;t last forever, so they export their stuff to Russia but visa proxy: Belarus, Kazakhstan and other countries of so called &quot;russian world&quot;. F.e.: Belarus began to import 26x more plums and 30x more milk from Poland after sanctions were introduced, which surely looks kind of suspicious but Russians probably don&#039;t care xD. Later on Belarusians mark these things with their trademark and sell to Russia as &quot;Belarusian product&quot;. Sometimes they are even too lazy to mark it as a product from Belarus, so they send trucks full of Polish products straight to Russian shops, risking that they are going to be checked by Russian police.

Being the first woman created by the gods, she was sent as a punishment. However, Pandora was not always despised as the bringer of evil.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Over the years, Pandora went from a revered goddess to the root of all evil, later to be conflated with other religions and immortalized in art and myth.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The earliest written myth of Pandora comes from Hesiod in \u201cWorks and Days\u201d, as well as his \u201cTheogony\u201d to a lesser extent. It is in these works that we see the first version of her as an ill-fated human that brought evil into the world. As the myth goes, she was the first woman created by the gods, Hephaestus and Athena at the request of Zeus. Zeus requested that she be made as a punishment to be unleashed on mankind, due to the transgressions of Prometheus, who had stolen fire from the gods and given it to man. Hephaestus molded her from the earth, just as man was created, but all of the gods gave her unique and seductive gifts<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;When Pandora was delivered to mankind, she brought with her a pithos (an ancient Greek vessel), later misconstrued as a box, which contained disease, pain, and various other evils that were released to the world. However, once the box was opened and Pandora saw all the evils fly out of it, she attempted to replace the lid, leaving one thing behind - hope. Thus, ended the Golden Age of man and the Silver Age began, in which man was not subjected to death.

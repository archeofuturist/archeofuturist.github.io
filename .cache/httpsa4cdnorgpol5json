This server has been mentioned in connection to investigations.<br><br>* Nobody knew who TeaLeaves was. Some speculated it was L Jean Camp herself which is the closest guess. It turned out to be a colleague of hers. See the info above for the damning proof. <br><br>* Tealeaves has a years-old wordpress account coincidentally named in leetspeak teakettle (t34k3ttl3). That&#039;s him. BTW I don&#039;t believe that FeelTheEmailMistake guy found it the way he says. I think he had to present it in a more eh &quot;public safe&quot; manner if you get my drift. Based on some other posts of his i think this guy is into some seriously heavy shit...and think about the timing of all this.<br><br>* The DNS logs contain + signs -- meaning recursive nameserver-nameserver queries which just doesnt happen. Even if we say the Russian nameservers have some weird setup -- well, the American medical nameservers have the same weird setup. Every damn nameserver has the same weird setup. Terribly unlikely...<br><br>* The guy mentions 6 indicators of forgery... says hes only &#039;reasonably confident&#039; based on the indicator above... but it&#039;s pretty fucking damning all by itself. My suspicion is that another indicator is based on meticulous analysis of TTLS and cache behavior","filename":"tumblr_nqtxhaDF1S1t6vkcqo1_1280","ext":".gif","w":640,"h":453,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":176,"tim":1490449212669,"time":1490449212,"md5":"TGJ9IiO2S0CMxgP6I1juAw==","fsize":612527,"resto":0,"id":"EKxJRbNd","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"clinton-crony-forged-dns-logs-for-russia","country_name":"United States","replies":12,"images":3,"omitted_posts":7,"omitted_images":1},{"no":118226188,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)09:53:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"No slide","time":1490450015,"resto":118224969,"id":"eupDEnJY","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118226236,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)09:54:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118226139\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118226139<\/a><br><br>Supposedly this guy found out that the Emily Mcmuffin didn&#039;t have a connection to Evan but yeah Evan McMullin is implicated in this finding","time":1490450052,"resto":118224969,"id":"EKxJRbNd","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118226250,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)09:54:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118226033\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118226033<\/a><br><a href=\"#p118225734\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118225734<\/a><br>He probably already committed suicide by shooting himself 4 times in the back of the head","time":1490450066,"resto":118224969,"id":"mw3zEhK4","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":118226316,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)09:55:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"Keep making these and ill keep bumping OP.","filename":"octopussy","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":640,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490450112790,"time":1490450112,"md5":"VP51PIo01dxFfM9RyhBpgQ==","fsize":61344,"resto":118224969,"id":"fmW\/aqzH","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118226433,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)09:57:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"Should anyone be contacted of this new information?<br><br>For something as big as this, no one seems to be saying anything.","time":1490450222,"resto":118224969,"id":"BqwCbkeU","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118212844,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)06:45:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"When will you take the socialism pill, pol?

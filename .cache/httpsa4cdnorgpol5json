I wake up, usually hungover, and roll over to my computer and wipe the crust out of my eyes as I stare at the blinding glow of my screen. I play something like CS or TF2 for a minute or two, something that&#039;s fast-paced enough to wake me up, without having to think to much. After that I&#039;ll sneak my mom&#039;s debit card out of her purse and go buy Mcdonalds breakfast. By the time I finish I still dont know what the fuck I&#039;m going to do for the rest of the day. So I pack a few bowls and of course get fucking high as shit. That&#039;s when I&#039;m in the mood for something more intellectually stimulating, like a jRPG... the stories in those usually never let me down, and being the hero in fictional universe is just the thing I need for the soulcrushing reality taht is my life. After a few hours I loose interest, and usually end up plugging my fleshlight before passing out into a nice afternoon weednap. When I wake up it usually takes a few hours to climb out of bed anyway, so it&#039;s usually dark by then. So I&#039;ll play something that&#039;s more fitting for night time -- something scary, dark &amp; moody -- Doom 3 for example, love replaying that one, I&#039;ve played threw it 20 times in the past 8 years. A pint of Captain later and it&#039;s basically like Im on the martian soil, blowing away demons &amp; monsters with my shot gun, like I&#039;m actually a space marine. I go to bed still fealing unfulfilled, like Ive been living the same day (though slightly varied) for the past 20 years. Even hearing the song Summer of &#039;69, I cant help but think of all the gaming experiences I had, for those truely were the best days of my life.

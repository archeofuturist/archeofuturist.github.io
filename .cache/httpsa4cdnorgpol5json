It\u2019s not about how you&#039;re connected to other people but what connects you with them. My connection is the shared humanity and love. All that connects you is your anger towards the world, edgy shock humor, bankrupted and anti-Semitic western ideals, making white supremacist OK signs and spreading hateful frog memes. That\u2019s all you have in your small community while mine is shared across the world in every culture.<br><br>Also it seems that while you were busy trying to divide me, your bigoted president has actually divided you. Sad. It really shows what all that lonely nerd resentment leads to in the end. I tried to welcome you guys and let you share the love and togetherness that HWNDU was all about but all you wanted was to ruin the joy for everyone else. Keep the flag if it\u2019s the only thing that makes you feel important. You are nothing but a bunch of fascists and thieves.

Middle ages Europe lost 1\/3 of it&#039;s population on a bad year to starvation.","time":1493648084,"resto":123623354,"id":"WYaa75gi","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123625713,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)10:21:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123623354\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123623354<\/a>","filename":"download","ext":".jpg","w":271,"h":186,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":85,"tim":1493648472440,"time":1493648472,"md5":"cQ00yFulVt4YU+lhTujiYg==","fsize":6083,"resto":123623354,"id":"oB5pEvVq","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123625935,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)10:23:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123625063\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123625063<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;aid to Africa<\/span><br><br>You mean paralyzing Children?","time":1493648602,"resto":123623354,"id":"ZlvS6\/Vk","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123626157,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)10:25:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123623909\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123623909<\/a><br>Bien dicho.","time":1493648736,"resto":123623354,"id":"Z+pHSSLf","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":123626221,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)10:26:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"Wooooooo, this is some low quality bait","filename":"pa08z7t0j2uy","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":480,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1493648768289,"time":1493648768,"md5":"XtTLIoTflTn2c0OoxJGNFA==","fsize":44788,"resto":123623354,"id":"Du80Wsyt","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]},{"posts":[{"no":123625976,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)10:23:49","name":"Anonymous","sub":"US Civil war","com":"Will the second american civil war be the greatest clusterfuck of all times?<br>I mean with all the racial,ethnic,political,religious and economic variables in the play it would be a massacre.<br>It would probably be yugoslavia multiplied by libya and then multiplied by somalia.","filename":"USA[1]","ext":".jpg","w":1200,"h":841,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":175,"tim":1493648629663,"time":1493648629,"md5":"qO865+LlgJ4CENs0FRi3yQ==","fsize":294098,"resto":0,"id":"s18MG+Xs","country":"HR","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"us-civil-war","country_name":"Croatia","replies":3,"images":0},{"no":123626138,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)10:25:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"Americans are too comfortable now, they won&#039;t fight back against the government","time":1493648726,"resto":123625976,"id":"7zpbPGsE","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123626214,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)10:26:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123626138\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123626138<\/a><br>\/Thread","time":1493648766,"resto":123625976,"id":"8Bk7QkU+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123626393,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)10:27:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123626214\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123626214<\/a><br>Yeah i know americans won&#039;t fight back but in a hypothetical situation where economic crisis or something similar struck where all the requirments for a civil war were fullfilled what do you think it would look like?","time":1493648873,"resto":123625976,"id":"s18MG+Xs","country":"HR","country_name":"Croatia"}]},{"posts":[{"no":123599148,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)05:06:28","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Conman Musk","com":"Finally people are beginning to call this scam artist out on his bullshit.

The book criticizes the party for being fascist, not left-wing. INGSOC is basically if the Nazis had more control because they still use money, trading, capitalism, and as they say the proles are allowed to believe in God.<br><br>However what really ticked me off was the relationship with Julia. Winston said he was &quot;overjoyed&quot; to know that Julia slept with over 100 men and enjoyed it all. He said he loved the fact that she had sex with tons of men who were also part of the outerparty. This is clearly a pro-sexual revolution book and is liberal in essence.","filename":"orwell","ext":".jpg","w":590,"h":320,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":135,"tim":1491941085660,"time":1491941085,"md5":"ksJp\/ZYHe0xxeu9rQKvtkg==","fsize":32460,"resto":0,"id":"D+KmcFTD","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"just-read-1984-bluepilled-hippy-propaganda","country_name":"Canada","replies":162,"images":14,"omitted_posts":157,"omitted_images":14,"tail_size":50},{"no":120661506,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)17:36:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120651450\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120651450<\/a><br>republicans were fucking savages, &#039;spanish republic&#039; was in fact a mere euphemism, and people dare to criticize Franco","filename":"iglesias1936_560x280","ext":".jpg","w":560,"h":280,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":62,"tim":1491946618663,"time":1491946618,"md5":"oB+vxmje8b7KdKk8gHLXgw==","fsize":38338,"resto":120647725,"id":"ApyH0J0V","country":"AR","country_name":"Argentina"},{"no":120661589,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)17:37:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120661098\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120661098<\/a><br>You&#039;re a bad troll.<br><br><a href=\"#p120661391\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120661391<\/a><br>you&#039;re dumb","time":1491946650,"resto":120647725,"id":"D+KmcFTD","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120662003,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)17:40:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120661589\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120661589<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;no argument<\/span><br><br>not surprised , cuck","time":1491946834,"resto":120647725,"id":"bNUnPMFd","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120662237,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)17:42:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120647725\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120647725<\/a><br>When some pleb says the US is turning into 1984, I verbally bitchslap them with the fact that we more closely resemble Brave New World.","time":1491946948,"resto":120647725,"id":"Ws11KkaW","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120662392,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)17:43:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120647725\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120647725<\/a><br>1984 is shit in comparison to Brave New World.

build, but there were frequent cross-border skirmishes, largely at Iran&#039;s instigation.[15]Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini called on Iraqis to overthrow the Ba&#039;ath government, which was received with considerable anger in Baghdad.[56] On 17 July 1979, despite Khomeini&#039;s call, Saddam gave a speech praising the Iranian Revolution and called for an Iraqi-Iranian friendship based on non-interference in each other&#039;s internal affairs.[56] When Khomeini rejected Saddam&#039;s overture by calling for Islamic revolution[46] in Iraq, Saddam was alarmed.[56] Iran&#039;s new Islamic administration was regarded in Baghdad as an irrational, existential threat to the Ba&#039;ath government, especially because the Ba&#039;ath party, having a secular nature, discriminated and posed a threat to the Shia movement in Iraq, whose clerics were Iran&#039;s allies within Iraq and whom Khomeini saw as oppressed.[56]<\/span>","time":1492436242,"resto":121514494,"id":"2WLx8m0z","country":"MA","country_name":"Morocco"},{"no":121526484,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)09:38:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a

Maybe younger white guys but not once they&#039;ve matured. Hollywood doesn&#039;t really realize that they&#039;ve lost this demographic and they&#039;re suffering in Hollywood. Alot of the studios are nearly bankrupt. Most of retail sales, which are about 70-80% of the US economy, are driven by women and children. The shop til you drop meme is true. Women buy way too much shit and are way too gullible. I see more guys complain more about this and it&#039;s getting to the boiling point. Women are so programmed to buy shit and to socialize that they&#039;re losing sight of what&#039;s important; namely raising and educating children properly. Common core has risen very much from the notion that education is about socialization. About passing tests and not about understanding subject matter.<br>Women (white women) are wrecking the social construct. They&#039;re the ones to blame. They&#039;re the collateral range. I see more and more of them literally over socializing their kids with there peers and their mothers to the point that once the weekend rolls around the new 9-5 grind starts. George Carlin got it right about how kids today are over booked, over manag d and over scheduled.

There are a fuck ton of average to smart people (not speaking relatively. Just numbers). Poor people are SO numerous in India that you have to stop yourself from crying just walking from one place to another because of what you get to see.

In fact, the word &quot;graduated&quot; in India means that you have a 4 year post secondary degree and not just passing high school, which is not even celebrated. I am not saying Indians are special, I am just saying that if you have that large of a population with education at the forefront of their minds, you will get very educated people and among them you will get very smart people.

You need to get your diet in check, stay active, and raise your testosterone. <br><br>DIET<br><br>Drink reverse osmosis or distilled water. (If you do distilled, supplement with minerals.) Avoid drinks with sugar or high fructose corn syrup. Energy drinks are fine but get the zero cal ones. <br><br>Make sure your carbs, proteins, and fats are coming from non-poisoned or non-refined sources. <br><br>Carbs -- get your carbs from clean sources like potatoes, rice, and quinoa. Avoid wheat and sugar at all costs. <br><br>Fats -- get fats from olive oil, nuts, coconut oil, avocado, etc. Avoid hydrogenated oils. <br><br>Protein -- get protein from animals. Bison is packed with more nutrients than beef. Make sure your fish are wild caught and not from sources with mercury. Avoid soy and other processed fake proteins at all costs. <br><br>Veggies and fruits -- get them at your local farmers market and make sure they&#039;re either organic or free of pesticides. <br><br>RAISING TESTOSTERONE<br><br>Get a blood test to see what your level is currently at. Our ancestors had around 1000 ng naturally. To raise it, first try it the natural way, by changing your diet and lifestyle habits. (You can find plenty of info online to do this.)

This might be a little long but it is has really happened, which will maybe make it worth to read.<br><br>So, currently I am 21 years old and have been fantasizing about my mother since my teenage years (around 16). No thought nor no porn excites me so much as thinking about having sex with my mother.<br><br>Enough back story, I&#039;m getting right to the point. One day I woke up with a hard on and decided to jerk off because I was horny. Thinking about my mom, it took me barely 5 minutes to get close to orgasm. I was so deep into my thoughts that i did not notice the steps towards my door. You can usually hear if someone is walking nearby.<br><br>I reached the point of no return and I was cumming. Really hard. Before I could realise, she opened the door and just stood there. I continued beating my meat and cumming pretty high and intense.<br><br>Having a couple strokes left, it struck me. My mom is in my room. But i kept stroking a couple more times before i could let go of my dick and pull up the blanket over me (I was fully naked and the sheets were pulled down to my knees while i was laying on my back.<br><br>So, after just having an intense orgasm, my heart was racing. It all happened so fast. Before i could say anything she started talking and asked me if I were hungry because she made some breakfast. I said that im not hungry and she casually said &quot;alright&quot; and closed the door.<br><br>After she left, I was like FUCK! She has not only seen my dick, but she has also seen me cumming. While processing what just happened, I got so hard again and started jerking off a second time, thinking about how this scenario could have played out differently and to this day I still like to think about it.<br><br>Just wanted to share this story.

It doesn&#039;t offer room for intellectualism or fact-based refutation. It operates entirely on clickbait, imagery and quick replies, especially on the faster boards like \/pol\/. On other websites such as NYT, reddit or more traditional forums, you are able to view and respond to a post hours after it has been made. This type of structure offers a much more intellectual-based dialog in which points can be refuted with facts and highlighted to be seen by many. In short, this disparity creates a very clear divide in political opinions and views - one based on facts and intellectual standards, and one based on imagery and propaganda.<br><br>What does \/pol\/ think?","filename":"0c308ea2a1cbe32781c1704734a1b21f","ext":".jpg","w":236,"h":236,"tn_w":236,"tn_h":236,"tim":1493873681622,"time":1493873681,"md5":"lmTyM1CKgjrgpBvrTJPM2w==","fsize":8492,"resto":0,"id":"wTJpg5ZN","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-problem-with-pol","country_name":"United States","replies":76,"images":12,"omitted_posts":71,"omitted_images":12},{"no":124030137,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)02:30:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124020957\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124020957<\/a><br><a href=\"#p124030030\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124030030<\/a><br><a href=\"#p124030071\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124030071<\/a>","filename":"identitypolitics3","ext":".png","w":1328,"h":3374,"tn_w":49,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493879409866,"time":1493879409,"md5":"XbLFnCvTW1IiEdPkxmB7lg==","fsize":536189,"resto":124020957,"id":"f4LMdt9B","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":124030238,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)02:31:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124030085\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124030085<\/a><br><br>Is not dead and changeable.

I do feel though that I am locked out of higher knowledge by some artificial constraints which can&#039;t be overcome with science because we don&#039;t have enough understanding of the brain or of the universe. <br><br>One night however I was having this thought, I believe in parallel universes and that there are infinite copies of me. And I thought that at least one of these copies is doing the exact same thing right now, laying in bed and thinking about the same thing as me. Then I thought, what if the limitation of the brain being able to perceive from parallel mes can be overcome by trying to make contact through thought\/consciousness with my copy who is thinking the exact same thing right now and basically is aware that I exist, just how I am aware that he does? And I shit you not I laid there in bed and just tried to focus really hard to make some kind of contact with my copy through consciousness and as I did that I could feel parts of my brain feeling really funny, like if they were changing or forming new connections or something. It kinda felt ticklish and &quot;airy&quot; almost like when you smoked weed, just even more moldable. Not a pothead btw I smoked like 5 timed my entire life. But as I felt that in my brain I got kind of nervous and anxious about what&#039;s happening so I stopped and just went to sleep. <br><br>I feel like I was about to unlock some new form og perception from parallel universe brains of myself or something. I feel like all the brains of one individual conscious mind\/soul are connected through parallelism but we don&#039;t know how to unlock it. But if we do however that means you&#039;ll gain access to infinite knowledge from all your infinite copies, knowledge of the past, present and future where things were exactly the same, slightly different or completely different (history and science wise).

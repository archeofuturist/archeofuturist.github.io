As they loomed over her, she began to sniffle, quieting down, and looking up at them, fear evident in her pretty blue eyes.

He then climbed under, sliding his feet over the pvc pipe keeping her legs spread, and pressing her nubile body against his large muscular one. Her pale white skin contrasted sharply with his dark, coaly black skin. He lifted her by the hips, and slid his huge meaty cock into her now well-used, well-lubed pussy. His four comrades stood over them, watching and working their cocks, as Taji began to pump his hips, working his dick in and out of Taylor\u2019s pussy.","filename":"blacked tay","ext":".png","w":796,"h":973,"tn_w":102,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490929366178,"time":1490929366,"md5":"x+B1xdI+J0cxZJVsmUPGEQ==","fsize":1832227,"resto":119008640,"id":"OsSI9lLE","country":"NZ","country_name":"New Zealand"},{"no":119010843,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)23:03:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119009204\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119009204<\/a><br>1488er here, eat shit you weak-kneed faggot","time":1490929420,"resto":119008640,"id":"OLJruH+Y","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119011316,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)23:08:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119008640\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119008640<\/a><br><br>Is that actually her?

LGBT voters are strongly Democratic, and the Democrats basically have their votes for life.<br><br>That&#039;s why the Democrats are pushing this shit so much. They need to convert young voters into LGBT to turn them into reliable voters and counter this trend among non-LGBT Millennials and Gen Zers.<br><br>They have had some success at doing this, but we can reverse the tide of degeneracy and leftism if we stop leftists from indoctrinating our youth into becoming LGBT.<br><br>This requires both attacking the Public School system and Media on a macro level, as well as the presence of strong male and female role models on the micro level.<br><br>If you have any siblings, children, or other relatives in Gen Z, I implore you to teach your children gender roles and be a good role model in that regard so they are not as easily convinced by leftists that they are LGBT.

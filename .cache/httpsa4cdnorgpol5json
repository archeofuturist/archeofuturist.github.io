Trump is not going to risk a major war and population centers in Seoul and Tokyo being hit. It is just a diversion and a way to have a &quot;patriotic&quot; us vs. them war state warm up for the real war. <br><br>This is the same reason North Korea was included in the &quot;axis of evil&quot; in the Bush II years, to obfuscate the race war for Israel\/Britain that our foreign policy actually is. <br><br>The reason for the (PR) hostilities is to divert world attention from Trumps&#039; blitzkreig against Syria and his attempt to fulfill the Oded Yinon Zionist &quot;Greater Israel&quot; plan. <br><br>My guess is it starts this summer. The attempt will be to reverse all of the US losses in Iraq War II, the Iran nuclear deal, Israel&#039;s loss to Lebanon in 2006, etc. Good luck with that. De facto, it will be to defend ISIS, which will be eradicated from both Iraq and Syria if urgent action is not taken. <br><br>Sadly, there is no way that it can turn out better than the Iraq war. <br><br>Moreover, it cannot but bring the wrath of God, for the explicit (unstated) purpose would be to save ISIS from destruction. I shudder to think of the consequences of this, when America has already been so weakened after Iraq war II.","filename":"Flag_of_North_Korea.svg","ext":".png","w":1280,"h":640,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492232031133,"time":1492232031,"md5":"PFwLgHmiiVlp5C02cT1PLg==","fsize":16342,"resto":0,"id":"FE5SOqNy","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"north-korea-a-diversion","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":1},{"no":121172228,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)00:57:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"It&#039;s always the god damned jews behind everything","filename":"1490707484701","ext":".jpg","w":3434,"h":2959,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":107,"tim":1492232247946,"time":1492232247,"md5":"cou5Awf7XaPqzTv6c1PQEw==","fsize":2096205,"resto":121171921,"id":"xT6Lo+E7","country":"AU","m_img":1,"country_name":"Australia"}]},{"posts":[{"no":121167576,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)00:12:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;le god emperor TRUMP won le election hahah cucks BTFO!!!!<\/span><br><br>Um, no sweetie.

Rule by majority is part of why the colonies were so under represented in the first place.

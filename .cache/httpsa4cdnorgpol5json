Everybody relates to the spectrum but what about the pyramid? The pyramid comes first, then at the bottom you get your left and right sectors which are broken up into smaller sectors. some are the same colors at the higher blocks. liberals and conservatives need to band together instead of fighting each other, this only creates more chaos which is needed. it&#039;s a distraction method while your country is being overrun, your rights have been given up. <br><br>did anyone notice the change in patterns in society since ww2? how many of you respect your grandparents for how they are as people, humble and hard workers. they grew up in hard times which made them into the people they were\/are. this goes the same for your parents. what you have now is not hard times, this is you being a whiny brat looking for handouts and an easy life. <br><br>well since half of you are not smart enough to educate yourself, you will realize when you do find out... the hard way, that what your giving up for a temporary easy life, will be drown in hard times and sorrow. when people do come to realize what is happening - you think suicide rates are high now? <br><br>wake up, work together, be humble and stand up for one another. the country isn&#039;t build on people fighting each other, its built with teamwork and hard effort, some more than others. but if you want to see what your country will be like in 20 years? when your too old to give a shit? look at south africa, look at brazil, look at north korea, look at indonesia. <br><br>last but not least, the key to working together is having an open mind. just because you don&#039;t like something one person says, by turning away or shunning it won&#039;t do anything. if you do that, you only have one side working to get things done and the person doing the shunning will not be happy, once again.<br><br>again, wake up, enjoy life, educate yourself. stop being a fool","filename":"migraines","ext":".gif","w":150,"h":150,"tn_w":150,"tn_h":150,"tim":1490171059996,"time":1490171059,"md5":"dm8x5cdGrDSObtSXi4r2aQ==","fsize":70997,"resto":0,"id":"p+AkW4Gl","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"remember-folks-its-not-left-or-right-anymore-is","country_name":"Canada","replies":2,"images":1},{"no":117741304,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)05:10:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117738448\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117738448<\/a><br>The public will see the pyramid soon enough.","filename":"8974254_orig","ext":".jpg","w":1002,"h":800,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":99,"tim":1490173842582,"time":1490173842,"md5":"zkuQtC4lmZhGt4+yg7R0\/g==","fsize":502893,"resto":117738448,"id":"q2ATSUho","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117744580,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)06:09:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117741304\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117741304<\/a><br>But who will care?<br><br>The blue pilled normies were given everything on Hilldawg right up front and still wanted to vote for her knowing what she&#039;s done and been a part of.

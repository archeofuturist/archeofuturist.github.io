In the first round, because there&#039;s so many candidates, everyone will pretty much have the option to find a candidate that is exactly as they desire. But the second round is reduced to two politicians, one of whom is seen as the epitome of establishment (Macron) which is problematic in this situation, and the other of which (Le Pen) is seen as &#039;taboo&#039; to support. As I understand it, unlike the first round, a large portion of France is still &#039;undecided.&#039; So even if the polls right now show Macron winning by 20, I think it&#039;s not unrealistic to contemplate the possibility that Macron will not in fact win by that much on election day. Maybe Macron will still win, but I don&#039;t think it&#039;s outside the realm of possibility for Le Pen to get in the lower to mid 40&#039;s. Even if she loses, getting that much of the vote would be significant because she would no longer be seen as a &quot;fringe&quot; candidate by the time the next elections roll around.","time":1493805655,"resto":123893870,"id":"OKJpT+Yt","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123896838,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)06:02:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"When&#039;s the big debate?<br><br>I want him to keep his promise and pull out like a coward after half an hour.","time":1493805777,"resto":123893870,"id":"fs3nxykr","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":123897327,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)06:11:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123894210\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123894210<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Whatever you say you fucking normie.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;normie<\/span><br><br>enormous fag detected","time":1493806265,"resto":123893870,"id":"0gXfj3Wl","country":"AT","country_name":"Austria"}]},{"posts":[{"no":123887714,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)03:44:14","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Name ONE (1) good thing communism has done for humanity.","filename":"(You)","ext":".png","w":1029,"h":1029,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493797454913,"time":1493797454,"md5":"Ujhr2V\/8yw9CFED1CfYynw==","fsize":614905,"resto":0,"id":"1TEl1vq9","country":"NZ","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"name-one-1-good-thing-communism-has-done-for","country_name":"New Zealand","replies":96,"images":14,"omitted_posts":91,"omitted_images":14},{"no":123896080,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)05:50:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"What I learned from communism is...<br>What I learned from communism is...<br>WHAT I LEARNED FROM COMMUNISM IS...","filename":"din_lern_nuffin","ext":".jpg","w":321,"h":321,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493805048434,"time":1493805048,"md5":"DhVQIiADedVH8hK9QMaRtw==","fsize":20058,"resto":123887714,"id":"4093vMA3","country":"CY","country_name":"Cyprus"},{"no":123897054,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)06:06:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123894285\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123894285<\/a><br><a href=\"#p123894319\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123894319<\/a>","filename":"nature14558-st1 FST","ext":".jpg","w":946,"h":1140,"tn_w":103,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493805988733,"time":1493805988,"md5":"ciF8V6dsh9ZWH0VcKM1OJg==","fsize":361940,"resto":123887714,"id":"yOiHVuTE","country":"PL","m_img":1,"country_name":"Poland"},{"no":123897149,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)06:08:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123897054\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123897054<\/a>","filename":"gGyqNg6 FST","ext":".png","w":518,"h":3636,"tn_w":17,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493806084921,"time":1493806084,"md5":"lgEoRsxkvW+HSgYN278rSw==","fsize":251666,"resto":123887714,"id":"yOiHVuTE","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":123897220,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)06:09:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;you got me on that one.<\/span>","time":1493806158,"resto":123887714,"id":"e6+i6hcc","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":123897325,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)06:10:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123897149\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123897149<\/a>","filename":"nature17993-st5 FST","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":601,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":117,"tim":1493806259236,"time":1493806259,"md5":"ARI6PUF2lOpmaQqEjzaYMQ==","fsize":161974,"resto":123887714,"id":"yOiHVuTE","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"}]},{"posts":[{"no":123896727,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)06:01:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"What can be done about the extreme population growth that will happen in Nigeria?","filename":"IMG_3837","ext":".png","w":270,"h":270,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493805674710,"time":1493805674,"md5":"gcDLMVvHn+WuKCAPw0LCJw==","fsize":33890,"resto":0,"id":"izW6WW5l","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"what-can-be-done-about-the-extreme-population","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0},{"no":123897320,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)06:10:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123896727\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123896727<\/a><br>Nature will find a solution itself: Starvation.","time":1493806256,"resto":123896727,"id":"QX7hZxfK","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"}]},{"posts":[{"no":123885743,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)03:17:52","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Why does all the worst anti-gay shit happen in the shittiest parts of the U.S. ?","com":"http:\/\/archive.is\/eVOgs<br><br>Do people in poor and rural areas of the U.S. feel some sort of pathological need to fuck with gay people?<br><br>--<br><br>The couple\u2019s nephew, John Gaspari, made the arrangements ahead of time with Picayune Funeral Home, the only funeral home in the county with an on-site crematory, according to the complaint.

I married the love of my life, started as a real estate agent and I was filled with optimism. I dont wanna bore you with every detail of my marriage so lets move on.<br><br>Two years ago, my wife decided to divorce me, because I was her only sex-partner and she wanted to experiment sex with other men and women. At this point I made a good high six figure income and the judge decided I had to pay alimoney and child support, only seeing my children every second weekend.<br>I felt into a depression, everything I worked for so hard in life was suddenly taken away, because my ex-wife decided it to be the right choice. I decided to hang myself, end my useless existence, atleast she wont get a free meal-ticket. <br><br>In 2015 I visited \/pol\/ and saw a women-hate-thread, this thread filled me with rage and anger, I decided not to kill myself. I decided to take vengeance on my ex-wife and society, I will force feed them the red pill of marriage.<br><br>Yeah, I work hard, pay my ex-wife the alimoney and have a new hobby.

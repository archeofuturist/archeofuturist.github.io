You can argue about what IQ measures or how significant it is, but the fact is it measures something. And that something correlates with how people, regardless of race, behave, function and co-exist in society.

If you fap to gay porn, that&#039;s 2 guys, and that&#039;s 100% gay. If you fap to &#039;straight&#039; porn, then that has a woman, sure, but you&#039;re also fapping to a guy, which makes it 50% gay. But a trap is like half male, half female, and thus a trap with a girl would add up to 75% girl, and thus only 25% gay. 2 women would be ideal, but that would be a lesbian relationship, which brings it around to gay again. If you fap to furry porn, then it&#039;s in a weird gray area, where if it&#039;s people in fursuits, the same rules apply, but if it&#039;s with animals, I would think it depends on said animal&#039;s sexuality. Then there&#039;s consent. If a person doesn&#039;t consent to something, but the other person does it anyway, that makes the other person stronger, and thus less gay. Let&#039;s say that means they&#039;re about 50% less gay. If it was gay rape, that means that it&#039;s now 75% gay. If it&#039;s straight rape by a man, then it&#039;s 25% gay. And, if it&#039;s trap gay porn, than that&#039;s 12.5% gay. So technically, yes, rape trap porn is the least gay porn there is, but that&#039;s still looped in with trap porn, hence why fapping to trap porn is the least gay thing there is.","time":1492991894,"resto":122500168,"id":"oI5obmDw","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]},{"posts":[{"no":122506411,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)19:20:15","name":"Anonymous","sub":"bookies have marcon at 90\u2105+ chance of winning","com":"lepen fags BTFO","filename":"il_570xN.666010287_lj93","ext":".jpg","w":570,"h":854,"tn_w":166,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492989615496,"time":1492989615,"md5":"c890gq6HZruBPRW5Nkre+Q==","fsize":84774,"resto":0,"id":"XeD9NYv6","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"bookies-have-marcon-at-90-chance-of-winning","country_name":"United States","replies":18,"images":7,"omitted_posts":13,"omitted_images":5},{"no":122510882,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)19:54:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122509543\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122509543<\/a><br>Politics is the new &quot;Americas got talent&quot; for women.

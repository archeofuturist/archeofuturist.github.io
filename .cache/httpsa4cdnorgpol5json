But I guess a TL;DR would be: it&#039;s like natural ressources. In good governed countries - very rare in Africa - they improve the situation. A little bit. In failed, corrupt, war torn countries however they make everything much worse. Money goes to the war lord, unsustainable family situations are created and the black African mindset is usually &quot;rich is, when you have a lot of people&quot;.<br><br>So while the west is reducing its native population and burning through it thanks to economic capitalism and cultural leftism, it is also subsidizing the birth explosion of Africa. And needless to say: the leftists in the west would looove to import the black Africans. As one famous headline said: &quot;Europe will become black - so what?&quot;<br><br>Why could it happen? Birthrate explosions create a lot of unemployed men and men who fail to find a mating partner. Literal Harem&#039;s form is not uncommon, especially in Islamic countries. These young men do what?

President Trump created a new, co-equal position specifically for Bannon to occupy: Chief Strategist.<br><br>In a similar arrangement during the campaign, below Trump himself there were always two chief administrators of the Trump campaign: a campaign manager and a chief executive. <br><br>Trump went through three campaign managers during the presidential campaign, two being fired upon their first major blunders and replaced with a subordinate. In order from first to last, including the primaries, they were Lewandowski, Manafort, and Conway. All the while, however, the same chief executive stayed on from start to finish: Bannon.<br><br>Bannon is an ideologue. Bannon is deeply political. Bannon isn&#039;t doing this because someone is paying him, or because he has some personal motivation to be close to the president. He has clear goals concerning America and this planet.<br><br>Some quotes from him:<br><br>&quot;I\u2019m a Leninist. Lenin wanted to destroy the state, and that\u2019s my goal too.

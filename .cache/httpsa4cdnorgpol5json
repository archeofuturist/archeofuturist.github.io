These women think they are super sophisticated.. they dont really like white men, especially in a sexual way. Do you even wonder why you hear about mail order brides from thailand, vietnam, phillipines but never from china? There is a reason for this. China is communist.. You cannot be casual or talk about politics.. Your woman is going to be fearful and cunt like.. It is totally impractical.

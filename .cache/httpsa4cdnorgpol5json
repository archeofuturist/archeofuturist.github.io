Most of Polish farmers found other markets to replace Russian one, but they didn&#039;t want to burn bridges, because sanctions don&#039;t last forever, so they export their stuff to Russia but visa proxy: Belarus, Kazakhstan and other countries of so called &quot;russian world&quot;. F.e.: Belarus began to import 26x more plums and 30x more milk from Poland after sanctions were introduced, which surely looks kind of suspicious but Russians probably don&#039;t care xD. Later on Belarusians mark these things with their trademark and sell to Russia as &quot;Belarusian product&quot;. Sometimes they are even too lazy to mark it as a product from Belarus, so they send trucks full of Polish products straight to Russian shops, risking that they are going to be checked by Russian police. If the Russian policeman is not bribed propery, it indeed happens, and then all these products are destroyed in front of camera accordingto Putin&#039;s Law, and showed in Russian TV to the audience. <br><br>Thanks to sanctions and Putin&#039;s grand strategy Poland sells as much products to the East as never before, for higher prices.

Other research also shows a huge surge in growth for Christianity in China which is currently the world&#039;s most &quot;atheist&quot; nation because of the atheist communist government suppressing religion, the research suggests that China will soon become the world&#039;s most Christian nation within 15 years. <br><br>This is simply history repeating itself: Christianity prospered in Rome back in the ancient era when it was suppressed and it still grew in the militant atheist soviet Russia when it was suppressed there only a century ago with the majority of Russians today now also identifying as Christian. Just goes to show that atheist suppression of religion still doesn&#039;t stop religion.<br><br>Sources for the legion of whiny \/Redditor\/ fedoras that will no doubt show up it this thread:<br><br>http:\/\/www.pewforum.org\/2015\/04\/02\/<wbr>religious-projections-2010-2050\/<br>http:\/\/www.pewforum.org\/2012\/12\/18\/<wbr>global-religious-landscape-unaffili<wbr>ated\/<br>http:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/news\/wor<wbr>ldnews\/asia\/china\/10776023\/China-on<wbr>-course-to-become-worlds-most-Chris<wbr>tian-nation-within-15-years.html<br>http:\/\/masterrussian.com\/russia\/fac<wbr>ts.htm","filename":"1490142549767","ext":".jpg","w":608,"h":755,"tn_w":201,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490437086537,"time":1490437086,"md5":"gbLQR\/M\/TdWWLU+dYjIA+Q==","fsize":123410,"resto":0,"id":"MpxPJwTX","country":"PL","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"atheism-is-the-fastest-shrinking-religion-in-the","country_name":"Poland","replies":21,"images":6,"omitted_posts":16,"omitted_images":4},{"no":118213391,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)06:52:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118211797\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118211797<\/a><br>The same can be said about you.<br><br>I say we bring back the old testament ways.","time":1490439171,"resto":118211033,"id":"hol8MsJ6","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118213538,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)06:54:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118212221\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118212221<\/a><br><br>It should probably be noted that almost every single major figure in the atheist movement is Jewish. You could make a compelling argument that atheism is specifically being pushed by Jews in today&#039;s society, and they seem to largely be targeting western Christians and only them.<br><br>For example, Sam Harris, Chapman Cohen, David Silverman, Michael Newdow, Gregory Epstein, Sherman Wine, Bill Maher, Eric Kaufmann, and of course, Richard Dawkins&#039;s mother has a Jewish surname and was stated to have lived in the only Jewish suburb of the city she grew up in.

The southern Koreans are proud of their race but they are ashamed of their state, which they view as a puppet state. That&#039;s why there are millions of people protesting Park Geun Hye, there are millions of people importing the import of US beef, burning American effiges, rioting against US military presence, there are millions protesting when a south Korean school girl gets run over by an American tank. Yet when there is an anti-DPRK protest there are only 30 people, mostly old veterans, one foot in the grave already.

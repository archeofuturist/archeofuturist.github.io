A nuclear blast is only so large and if a another country is going to strike America, the are going to either hit a major city or a major military base. No one will bother nuking nowhereville. Even staying with someone outside of the high risk zone for a while until the worst of the threat has subsided will work.<br><br>2. Reinforce your shelter. There is a good chance that your shit shack will collapse in the shock wave. There is a good chance you will die if your shelter collapses.<br><br>3. Limit flammable materials around and on your shelter. Fire will spread throughout the city after the blast. It is only a matter of time before the flames hit your property. The less around your shelter the less likely that the flames will destroy your shelter. <br><br>4. Make your property wet. Roof? wet. Lawn? wet. Trees? remove them and fill the hole with water. The idea is to make your shelter as unwelcoming to any flames as you can. Remember in a fallout, no can help you. If your shelter is burning all of your preparation is as good as gone. A kiddie pool on top your roof looks weird, but can help. If the fire spreads close enough, the heat will melt the plastic releasing the water on the side with the fire.<br><br>5. Get a back up plan. What if you are nowhere near your shelter when the blast hits? What if getting to your shelter would put you in greater risk? What if your shelter is no longer safe? Try and figure out where a nuke might be dropped near you. Using the most probable locations figure out back up plans based on your common activities. You won&#039;t have a lot of warning to get back to your shelter with. A subway tunnel might make a decent makeshift shelter if you can&#039;t get back to your shelter. A large river might save you from burning to death in the after blaze.","time":1492183652,"resto":121059377,"id":"INpjyp6l","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121072661,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)11:28:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121059377\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121059377<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;yfw when the newfags thought we were joking <\/span><br><br>http:\/\/www.msn.com\/en-au\/news\/world<wbr>\/n-korean-official-ready-for-war-if<wbr>-trump-wants-it\/ar-BBzQnec?li=AAgfY<wbr>rC&amp;OCID=HPCDHP<br><br>let it be known \/pol\/ was right again","time":1492183697,"resto":121059377,"id":"XXGuFZbw","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":121072664,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)11:28:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121072383\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121072383<\/a><br>The particles from Chernobyl infected sheep and deer in northern England at the time, they had to be culled.

Instead, drug users scan a card and enter a unique ID number in order to vend one of the colorfully gift-wrapped boxes inside.<br><br>The center worked in collaboration with the Southern Nevada Health District and the Nevada AIDS Research and Education Society (NARES) to install the new machines, which will be available at three different locations by the end of May. Each client will be limited to two kits a week; each box contains syringes, alcohol wipes, safe sex supplies, and a sharps disposal box.<br><br>Nevada is the first U.S. state to launch a vending machine program for clean syringes, but the vending machine model has been in use for several years in Puerto Rico, Europe, and Australia.<br><br>According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), heroin use among young people ages 18-25 has more than doubled over the past decade. And between 2002 and 2013, the rate of heroin overdose deaths more than quadrupled.<br><br>In January 2016, Congress ended a ban on federal funding to syringe exchange programs. The move was made partially in response to the highly publicized 2015 HIV crisis that hit a tiny county in rural Indiana \u2014 where nearly 200 people were diagnosed with HIV in relation to a &quot;close network&quot;

Simply put, the naturalistic fallacy does not apply to humans anymore because we are artificially disconnected from nature. Perhaps biologically speaking, there are clear distinctions between male and female. But we are not dumb stupid animals anymore whose only purpose is to breed and reproduce. We are intelligent sentient beings that are able to shape our own destinies not letting biology or nature dictate what we are capable of.

In the quadripartite caste system of ancient Aryan civilizations they were the warrior caste, the best physically, the best morally, etc. Above them were only the priestly caste and sometimes a king, in whom the functions of the warrior and priestly caste were united (hence purple is the royal color - a sort of blend of red for the virile warrior caste, and white from the priestly caste). <br><br>But things have reached such a point today that there are no caste systems anywhere, no hierarchy. The watchword is &quot;equality&quot; everywhere you look. The best are hated by the envious inferiors which are much more numerous. <br><br>I think this whole situation will have to get much worse before it can get better.","time":1492306951,"resto":121289725,"id":"vcmC8CW1","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121296814,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)21:43:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121296468\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121296468<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;fuck that<\/span><br>You&#039;ve forgotten how we&#039;ve tamed the savages in the past.","time":1492306990,"resto":121289725,"id":"cZKX11NQ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":121294503,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)21:25:03","name":"Anonymous","sub":"STUDY: Female binge drinkers unfairly stigmatised by media","com":"STUDY: Female binge drinkers unfairly stigmatised by media<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Glasgow academics say women\u2019s binge drinking given more coverage in press, despite men drinking more in reality<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Women who binge drink are portrayed more negatively by the media than men who do the same, according to a study.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Researchers at the University of Glasgow and Glasgow Caledonian University examined how the media report women\u2019s and men\u2019s drinking habits.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The study, published in BMJ Open, analysed 308 articles published over two years in seven UK national newspapers and found women\u2019s binge drinking was given more coverage, despite men drinking more in reality.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;It also found that as well as misrepresenting differences in the amount each gender drinks, articles depicted women\u2019s and men\u2019s binge drinking in different ways.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Academics say the articles typically linked women\u2019s binge drinking to how it affected their appearance and presented them as haggard, vulnerable, socially transgressive and a burden to their male drinking companions.<\/span><br><br>https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/society<wbr>\/2016\/dec\/28\/female-binge-drinkers-<wbr>unfairly-stigmatised-by-media-says-<wbr>study<br><br>---<br><br>Looks like yet another double standard against women has discovered in our male-dominated society.<br><br>What do you think about this?","filename":"CRP_017","ext":".webm","w":1080,"h":1806,"tn_w":149,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492305903999,"time":1492305903,"md5":"z0PzV2juI1IOu9oWjWaWxw==","fsize":3072744,"resto":0,"id":"aJV4kAot","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"study-female-binge-drinkers-unfairly-stigmatised","country_name":"United States","replies":8,"images":3,"omitted_posts":3,"omitted_images":3},{"no":121295348,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)21:31:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"Tbh drunk bitches are annoying af, I can see why they would be stigmatized","time":1492306284,"resto":121294503,"id":"UdxkhNUN","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121295440,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)21:32:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121294704\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121294704<\/a><br>let it post a couple more guvna","time":1492306325,"resto":121294503,"id":"GntNPYbp","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":121295562,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)21:33:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Glasgow academics<\/span>","filename":"1459732961797","ext":".png","w":495,"h":498,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492306390890,"time":1492306390,"md5":"qJP3WcaMOohAXyuXKiDnIQ==","fsize":334940,"resto":121294503,"id":"6tEFcKz3","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121295787,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)21:34:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121295348\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121295348<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Tbh drunk bitches are annoying<\/span><br><br>And the men who get drunk and try to start fights aren&#039;t, riiiiight?","filename":"CRP_054","ext":".webm","w":1080,"h":1870,"tn_w":72,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492306498442,"time":1492306498,"md5":"g5x9W4apyOJL20lw98i2Og==","fsize":3097355,"resto":121294503,"id":"aJV4kAot","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121296808,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)21:43:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"Drunk women that have been drinking are more vulnerable to a sexual assault than men are.","filename":"vintage-ads-disease","ext":".jpg","w":394,"h":290,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":92,"tim":1492306985159,"time":1492306985,"md5":"IwDGhndtJB+YeJy3Oysb3A==","fsize":37048,"resto":121294503,"id":"MNBM\/Lqa","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":121248807,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)15:31:29","name":"Anonymous","sub":"R1a, are Poles the ultimate Aryans\/Iranians?","com":"This is the second thread I am posting about this, the last one I&#039;ve posted a few months back and I got some interesting responses. <br><br>If you look at the map of R1a, you will notice that there are two places where the R1a haplogroup is very prevalent.

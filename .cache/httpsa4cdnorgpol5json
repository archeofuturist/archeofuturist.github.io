I remember that I was sitting down and I started thinking, maybe for 5 minutes, maybe for an hour, I couldn&#039;t tell and neither of my friends knows, they didn&#039;t even knew where I was. As some of you may know, after the initial trip, these psychedelics leave a residual state of mental acuity for the next few days.<br>I had an epiphany, it&#039;s really difficult to explain it.

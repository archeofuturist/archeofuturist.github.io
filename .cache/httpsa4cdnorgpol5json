So instead of rolling over like a fag he is going there anyway. Antifa is going to be shipped in nationwide to oppose him. Everyone is welcome to stand up for free speech and come listen to Spencer. <\/span><br><br>If you ever wanted to see Spencer or organize against anti-white commies here is your chance boys. You might even make some friends <br><br>The march is at Auburn University in Alabama this Tuesday at 7pm.<br><br>So here are some ground rules to keep people safe and on message.<br><br>1. Do not dress in black. tactical mistake. That is the garb of communists. Wear whatever you can &quot;protest&quot; in comfortably. Business casual is fine, or whatever you can wear that doesn&#039;t look like shit. Ballcap and sunglasses are fine. Feel free to wear Trump hats, Auburn hats, or other patriotic apparel.<br><br>2. No guns. Yes Alabama is a progun state, but guns are not allowed on college campuses. Leave your gun at home. There may be fights. Defend yourself but DO NOT ACT UNPROVOKED. Boys will have your back at all times. A shooting - justified or not - will hurt everything we are trying to do.<br><br>3. No blatant KKK\/Neo-Nazi\/&quot;Nigger&quot; &quot;kike&quot; stuff. Memes are fine. But try to keep it topical to free speech on colleges, anti-antifa, or pro-white identity - stuff that people will see on the news and agree with. If you have blatantly crazy shit on your sign or assault somebody millions will see it and decide who to side with based on that. It&#039;s shit optics.<br><br>4. Bring medical supplies to help your friends out. Stuff like gauze and whole milk for pepper spray (and chugging infront of antifa). Baking soda and water is great for pepper spray too. If you want to go full prepper and bring your EMS bag its up to you. <br><br>5. Have fun, bring\/make friends, and get phone numbers. This summer is going to be wild and this is just the beginning. There will be MANY MANY more events like this.","filename":"spencerflag","ext":".png","w":1500,"h":1000,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1492372981168,"time":1492372981,"md5":"LBGG+y6bMeub2euW2QLf+Q==","fsize":679613,"resto":0,"id":"IFnjIg+x","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"letspencerspeak-in-auburn-al","country_name":"United States","replies":149,"images":22,"omitted_posts":144,"omitted_images":19,"tail_size":50},{"no":121416770,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)17:22:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121409015\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121409015<\/a><br>MY SIDES","time":1492377747,"resto":121405297,"id":"4mvrv9i9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121416848,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)17:22:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121414343\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121414343<\/a><br>Im not trolling anyone.

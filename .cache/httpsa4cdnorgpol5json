I&#039;m using an American proxy, appropriately, perhaps, since soon my country will be (((Americanized))), in spite of my best efforts to keep it racially pure and culturally traditional. I fear I will suffer the fate of Hitler, relegated to the ignominious role of villain in a (((manufactured))) history written by the inevitable winners: You.<br><br>I know what you&#039;re thinking: &quot;Faggot LARPer.&quot; Wrong. I have reached out amidst the fray to declare my unabashed admiration for what you do here. Keep fighting the good fight.

This has been no accident, as my country has been experimenting with inter-dimensional polytheistic nationalism for some time now, as a stratagem to be employed against (((them))) in a world where the flow of information is fastidiously controlled. <br><br>For example, you may be wondering why my english is so formal, and why I do not seem, in my true person, to be the bloviating, insecure dictator spouting off anti-western soundbites in hilariously broken english.

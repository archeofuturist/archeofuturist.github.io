San Francisco dermatologist Andrea Hui says balding millennials are coming to her more than ever, asking her for everything from natural supplements like Nutrafol to more invasive procedures like PRP, which involves injecting your own plasma into your scalp. New York City stylist Angelo David has seen a \u201ctremendous\u201d number of young and balding clients too: \u201cThe new hair extension story is no longer short to long but thin to thick,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople want full and voluminous hair.\u201d One of his most recent clients, in fact, was a college student just shy of her 20th birthday who had severe hair loss. \u201cShe was devastated,\u201d he says, spending roughly $4000 on a customized, couture wig to cover up the issue.<br><br>One big reason for the follicle freakout? High stress, say both Hui and David. Indeed, millennials are more stressed out that any other generation, according to research from the American Psychological Association. And that stress can lead to hair loss, research shows. There\u2019s a condition called telogen effluvium, which happens when \u201csignificant stress pushes large numbers of hair follicles into a resting phase\u201d and then hair falls out, and one called alopecia areata, in which your immune system attacks the hair follicles, which can be exacerbated by stress. There\u2019s also a disorder called trichotillomania, in which stressed-out people feel an irresistible urge to pull their hair out.","filename":"1492763413132s","ext":".jpg","w":250,"h":250,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493676414790,"time":1493676414,"md5":"lb828YT4AxrxrHU6BFMmOA==","fsize":8195,"resto":0,"id":"XDYYUblI","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"what-the-actual-fuck-is-going-on-is-it-the-gay","country_name":"United States","replies":29,"images":6,"omitted_posts":24,"omitted_images":5},{"no":123688572,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)19:09:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123680658\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123680658<\/a><br>it&#039;s the stress right","filename":"image","ext":".jpg","w":688,"h":456,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":82,"tim":1493680154914,"time":1493680154,"md5":"YFobQmuf+Da5hsaxuGdCgg==","fsize":51949,"resto":123680658,"id":"uKrWXscz","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":123688796,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)19:11:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123688572\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123688572<\/a><br><br>Fucking kikes!

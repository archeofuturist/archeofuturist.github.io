You few who saw what this world would become if we kept down the leftist path by pure luck, higher understanding, or if you&#039;re like me, the grace of God, stood up to the most powerful cabal on the planet and beat them for the most powerful seat on the face of the planet. <br><br>You did this, \/pol\/. <br>And we are not done yet.<br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=E3c<wbr>FiWtcT4k<br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=yCC<wbr>WB5z1uG0<br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=5WX<wbr>V1PxUiAM<br><br>Only good feels in this thread. I&#039;d like to make this a continuous thing to bring a little more life to you guys. You are dangerous when you allow the walls around your heart to come down. Cynicism may seem like the only way to go right now but that&#039;s only because normies have become cynical too in recent years.","filename":"brothers","ext":".jpg","w":652,"h":344,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":131,"tim":1490671146764,"time":1490671146,"md5":"yycXLiibffEZL3g4AoXzjw==","fsize":95353,"resto":0,"id":"ivqHk68D","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"hope-thread","country_name":"United States","replies":75,"images":29,"omitted_posts":70,"omitted_images":25},{"no":118612435,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)00:49:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118609830\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118609830<\/a><br>ah fair enough, thanks","time":1490676557,"resto":118604017,"id":"U1b0JvBy","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":118612712,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)00:52:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118612130\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118612130<\/a><br>Keep your head up and keep to yourself.<br>You&#039;ve got friends, you just don&#039;t know them yet.","time":1490676732,"resto":118604017,"id":"fmwrpRM4","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118612982,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)00:55:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118610864\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118610864<\/a><br>I&#039;m concerned about that as much as anyone else, for sure. My thoughts are that the evil that controls aspects of our government are going to be selfish as fuck. Selfish, greedy, and out for themselves - as we know. I think that they would also want to avoid any catastrophic global disaster\/conflict (nuke etc) in order to continue their endeavors into physical pleasures. Just as we want to simply live happily without devolving into world conflict, so to would they, but their reason for wanting to persist on Earth is to fuck children. Or whatever the flavor of evil may be. <br><br>Regardless of how much technology progresses, we seem to adapt well to it. There will always be a place to carve out our own section of the world. There will always be that guy that decides to program his own messenger app with encryption because the Snowden revelations freaked him out. There will always be someone who makes videos about these corrupt gapefags and end up becoming popular, exposing the truth to millions. <br><br>Evil seeks itself out of necessity. They are the minority, and their survival is based off of secretive maneuvers among a somewhat small group of people. <br><br>Good does not by default seek itself out, which leaves us at a disadvantage in the first few turns of the game. We are unsuspecting, idealistic, optimistic. But when we finally understand the breadth of the evil that has its hands in our lives, the good is just as efficient at seeking eachother out as Evil, except that here&#039;s the thing: Good doesn&#039;t seek itself out out of necessity like Evil does. The good people in humanity seek eachother out not to hide like the evil does but instead simply be free, and that&#039;s why Good will win.","filename":"maxresdefault","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":720,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1490676930942,"time":1490676930,"md5":"Y8xXxiwerCK5762WEfvYAw==","fsize":69172,"resto":118604017,"id":"WCcZwmm5","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":118613027,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)00:56:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118612130\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118612130<\/a><br>I live in SoCal as well anon, and though we not know each other you&#039;ve got a friend in me.","time":1490676960,"resto":118604017,"id":"DpJkVLB1","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118613091,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)00:56:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118609141\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118609141<\/a>","filename":"we are powerfull together","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":373,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1490677009450,"time":1490677009,"md5":"I+Zu56\/MnlhSVZabdRzOrg==","fsize":78851,"resto":118604017,"id":"6VgtxU3b","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118611538,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)00:39:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"Huh.... really makes you..... think......","filename":"hmm","ext":".jpg","w":235,"h":214,"tn_w":235,"tn_h":214,"tim":1490675988953,"time":1490675988,"md5":"pemIFQ\/vkivumtmrCtJYWw==","fsize":10235,"resto":0,"id":"HcQfwNvx","country":"NZ","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"huh-really-makes-you-think","country_name":"New Zealand","replies":14,"images":1,"omitted_posts":9,"omitted_images":0},{"no":118612777,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)00:53:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118612416\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118612416<\/a><br>Maoris are obviously one of the finest iterations of homo sapien mixed ape...<br><br>His size is truly impressive on average they are fucking tall and fucking wide...<br><br>They are the only native population to fight the british to treaty whilst also engaging in intertribal warfare.<br><br>They are actually descended from asian except they have been head hunting each other with sticks for years.<br><br>They are time honed killing machines and one of the types of ape that should be preserved for posterity and rugby","time":1490676780,"resto":118611538,"id":"mTku4EMk","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":118612836,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)00:53:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118612416\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118612416<\/a><br>very hospitable as well.","time":1490676825,"resto":118611538,"id":"mTku4EMk","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":118612879,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)00:54:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118612777\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118612777<\/a><br>They&#039;re they&#039;re a bunch of dumb angry fatsos and I&#039;m saying that as an American.","time":1490676858,"resto":118611538,"id":"85w2a80e","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118613037,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)00:56:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118612180\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118612180<\/a><br>red pilled","time":1490676969,"resto":118611538,"id":"1ULg2ES6","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118613064,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)00:56:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118612879\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118612879<\/a><br>This may be true of a lot of em.

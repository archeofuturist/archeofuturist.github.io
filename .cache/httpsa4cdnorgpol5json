O&#039;Leary has been polling higher, but polls also indicate that he has a much higher percentage of &quot;never O&#039;Leary&quot; voters than Bernier has &quot;never Bernier&quot; voters. So, while no candidate has the 50%+1 needed to win the leadership on the first-choice ballot, the second and third will likely do it.<br><br>Remember: In a ranked ballot, the lowest scoring candidates are the ones who are eliminated first. So since Bernier is in the top 2 based on polls, it&#039;s unlikely that a Bernier voter&#039;s second rank ballots will actually go anywhere. It&#039;s far more critical for people who vote for Scheer, Blaney, O&#039;Toole or Leitch, for instance. If those voters don&#039;t have second or third rank ballots, then they might end up with O&#039;Leary even if they hate his guts.<br><br>Ranked ballots are better for representation, but they also make it really fucking stressful, since it&#039;s much harder to call who the winner will be ahead of time.

tried, the more she iced me off. and her mother was supporting her through it all.<br><br>when i woke up, it felt like ive had a vision or something. it felt too real.<br><br>a few days later

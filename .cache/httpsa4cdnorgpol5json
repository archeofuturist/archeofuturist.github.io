Against what people meme around, Catalonia is pretty right wing, we&#039;ve had mostly right wing govts. But there&#039;s no real right wing in Spain. Spain has been like a planned economy since the days of Franco, and even the right wing parties constantly boast about MUH PUBLIC SERVICES because they know that&#039;s how they get votes.<br>South is the most left-wing region because all they want is free gib.<br><br>There&#039;s mostly two kinds of British people: pensioners living out their days in the sun, an drunk chav tourists. The former are nice people, the latter are worse scim than Spaniards themselves which is quite a feat.","time":1490661796,"resto":118570343,"id":"uVtZ494K","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":118587645,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)20:49:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"Piedgedemont hara a Catalu\u00f1a independiente?","time":1490662170,"resto":118570343,"id":"\/H5F+nZE","country":"MX","country_name":"Mexico"},{"no":118587907,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)20:51:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118574930\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118574930<\/a><br>because of 1492.","time":1490662306,"resto":118570343,"id":"\/H5F+nZE","country":"MX","country_name":"Mexico"},{"no":118588056,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)20:53:18","name":"LARPer","com":"Second Spanish Civil War when?","filename":"spanish_civil_war","ext":".png","w":324,"h":419,"tn_w":96,"tn_h":124,"tim":1490662398319,"time":1490662398,"md5":"L3Ems0BwfAN1WcGpbxc6xg==","fsize":36204,"resto":118570343,"id":"YD1Yzzfn","country":"PT","country_name":"Portugal"},{"no":118588583,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)20:58:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118588056\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118588056<\/a><br>Catalan referendum will trigger second civil war.<br><br>SCREENCAP THIS","time":1490662681,"resto":118570343,"id":"uVtZ494K","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118562992,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)17:13:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"Prove to me that the 90&#039;s weren&#039;t the best era.<br><br>Protip: You can&#039;t.","filename":"arsenio1","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":430,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":179,"tim":1490649204153,"time":1490649204,"md5":"\/Tv\/BFD7NKJ12e1FG6RszQ==","fsize":103358,"resto":0,"id":"Rd9m0fM0","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"prove-to-me-that-the-90s-werent-the-best-era","country_name":"United States","replies":191,"images":86,"omitted_posts":186,"omitted_images":86,"tail_size":50},{"no":118585811,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)20:31:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118566026\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118566026<\/a><br>Shit to look forward to.

statement can lead people to feel hopeless about our situation, but this ignores one simple and key fact.<br>The reason this is so is solely because there are more blacks and Muslims coming into our countries and having lots of children, NOT because the numbers of whites are decreasing rapidly!<br>I know white birthrates are declining etc, but they are not declining at a rate we should be concerned about. The only reason this decline in birthrates is a cause for concern in the current climate is because of the huge influx of blacks and Muslims skewing the total population percentages - There are still HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF WHITES IN EUROPE!<br><br>Now, look at South Africa and Rhodesia during white rule (e.g. 1950s). Whites ruled these nations while being MINORITIES. Even as low as 10-20% minorities in a country of 80-90% blacks. Think about that for a moment.<br><br>Let&#039;s take the UK as an example:<br>If we kicked EVERY SINGLE non-white and EVEN every single white non-British out, there would still be 51,736,290 white British people living in the UK (as of 2011) - this is just shy of the entire population of the UK in 1960 (52.2M).<br><br>This number is greater than the number of white British living in the UK when the British Empire was the largest and most powerful Empire OF ALL TIME (44.4M in the 1920s). This shows that whites are capable of doing great and amazing things never before seen on the face of the Earth at SMALLER numbers than we have now!<br><br>We are NOT few in number and we are NOT powerless.

This Kekcoin will have the same amount of value as square meters of land owned (Read: 1 square meter of land = 1 Kekcoin). The idea stems from the German Rentenmark. This way, our currency will be the very first one which is backed by actual goods: land.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;2) People who are eligible to live in the MPoK will have to buy those coins, go to the location, and claim a piece of land in relation to how many Kekcoins he spends.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;3) Not everybody will be eligible to live there, but even if you are not eligible, you can invest in the MPoK.

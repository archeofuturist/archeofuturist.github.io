They were at least at intelligent as modern humans but lived in much smaller societies. They first left Africa ~250,000 y.a. and interbred with later homo sapiens who left Africa ~75,000 y.a. <br><br>All populations contain some Neandertal admixture EXCEPT for Sub-Saharan Africans. They contain no Neanderthal DNA and more &quot;archaic hominid&quot; aka homo heidelbergensis or homo erectus, our 2 basal ancestors. <br><br>To further confuse the situation, Australian Aboriginals are so distantly related to all living humans (and least related to Sub-Saharan Africans) that they are all but considered a separate species. Also, there is an extinct group of hominid species called homo denisovan that only interbred with Melanesian (Oceanic Islander) peoples. <br><br>So modern humans are actually 4 distinct sub-species of the genus homo: <br><br>1. Homo sapiens sapiens (modern Sub-Saharan African) <br>2. Homo sapiens eurasia (modern Eurasians. 3-4% Neanderthal admixture) <br>3. Modern Melanesian (3-5% Denisovan admixture)<br>4. Australian Aboriginals. <br><br>This information is clear as day in the modern (post Neanderthal gene sequencing c.a. 2010) literature but has not made it to the public because of the implications. <br><br>Anthropologist AMA","filename":"humanevohistory","ext":".png","w":567,"h":417,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":91,"tim":1490231400283,"time":1490231400,"md5":"QdZCBcYM1CEJzfYkpl9+sA==","fsize":29435,"resto":117853928,"id":"cVFuIq6c","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117862256,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)21:10:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117853928\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117853928<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;have extremely pointy occipital protrusion<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;go to east asia for holiday, people sleep on wooden or marble blocks<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;wonder why this doesn&#039;t hurt them like it does for me<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;mfw they feel my occipital protrusion and think I am some kind of freak<\/span>","time":1490231444,"resto":117853928,"id":"DMLszjpS","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":117862634,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)21:13:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"Apparantly most scandinavians got one and the nazis measured them to see if it correlated with intelligence (It did not)","time":1490231597,"resto":117853928,"id":"eNQHmai6","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"}]},{"posts":[{"no":117862195,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)21:10:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;President Schiff<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Vice President Schiff<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Attorney General Schiff<\/span><br><br>Pick one or more","filename":"Untitled","ext":".png","w":1025,"h":577,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1490231420466,"time":1490231420,"md5":"6hbejtSqztT9KQsv7mk7sg==","fsize":722584,"resto":0,"id":"IT8bDIlC","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"president-schiff","country_name":"United States","replies":3,"images":1},{"no":117862493,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)21:12:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"Inmate Schiff","time":1490231541,"resto":117862195,"id":"Bk3ol1Uh","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":117862630,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)21:13:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117862195\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117862195<\/a>","filename":"charles-logan","ext":".jpg","w":371,"h":500,"tn_w":92,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490231594022,"time":1490231594,"md5":"K\/Do6TEFwAPfoZeJuO2rIg==","fsize":66830,"resto":117862195,"id":"qPUVyxlK","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":117862680,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)21:13:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117862493\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117862493<\/a><br><br>What&#039;s the charge?","time":1490231619,"resto":117862195,"id":"IT8bDIlC","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":117827034,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)17:12:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"Your London attacker","filename":"Palace-of-Westminster-incident[1]","ext":".jpg","w":810,"h":539,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1490217173445,"time":1490217173,"md5":"Z2WhqGwmiATv0GE\/3QB50A==","fsize":73562,"resto":0,"id":"o6fgzQBj","country":"IE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"your-london-attacker","country_name":"Ireland","replies":238,"images":59,"omitted_posts":233,"omitted_images":58,"tail_size":50},{"no":117861895,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)21:08:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117832596\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117832596<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Myanmar taking over Pence&#039;s state<\/span><br><br>I can see why","filename":"7eb2f5d2101ace0a8b64e5b334db2dda","ext":".jpg","w":579,"h":457,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":98,"tim":1490231289589,"time":1490231289,"md5":"ES9JbRhbzKZwR+4w\/ZQTRw==","fsize":45501,"resto":117827034,"id":"0F2opUtR","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117862216,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)21:10:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"So who is always acting a bit mischievously? <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The Nice Attack was a Muslim<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The Paris Attacks were Muslims<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The Shoe Bomber was a Muslim <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The Orlando attack was a Muslim <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The Beltway Snipers were Muslims <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The Fort Hood Shooter was a Muslim <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The Underwear Bomber was a Muslim <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The U.S.S.

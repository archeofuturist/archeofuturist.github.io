And yet it&#039;s not such a complex matter if you have even a modicum of understanding of what life is all about. Reproduction, like all life, is all about sacrifice. If we take the parents as isolated individuals (as opposed to parts of a cosmic chain), they stand to gain nothing from the creation and rearing of children. The benefits they would receive in old age via means of their children&#039;s caretaking are nothing compared to the insane costs they&#039;d have to incur to raise them in the first place, so the transaction is a net expenditure on their part, and by a vast margin. Now the hyperculture of the master race has created a consciousness of how important the rearing process is, and how costly if it is to be done right, so even when members of the master race reproduce, they only create one or two descendants, as opposed to the constant mindless shitting out of fetuses that they used to indulge in when they were uncivilized, or indeed that the subhuman races still continue to this day. So that is one important factor for the master race&#039;s population decline. Without it, things would be dramatically different, since with the amount of resources a typical middle class family lavishes on a single child you could raise an entire village of little Middle Eastern towelheads or niggers. In simple terms, the master race is going for quality over quantity, and that&#039;s a major part of what&#039;s causing the decline.","filename":"designer_babies_urgent_fast_moving_fertility_tech-3","ext":".jpg","w":1408,"h":792,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1491441719126,"time":1491441719,"md5":"x7FGl8eVAitvoX03GsDrbw==","fsize":75172,"resto":0,"id":"sA9+EplF","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-population-decline-of-the-master-race-whites","country_name":"United States","replies":3,"images":2},{"no":119685428,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)21:23:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"Simultaneously, the successive decline of religion, nationalism and finally the importance and sanctity of blood ties and the institution of marriage have created the Individual \u2014 unknown to lower cultures or earlier phases of the master race&#039;s culture \u2014 who is, like all advances, something of a double-edged sword, which many use to advance and improve their lives (or, more correctly: the future of their genes), but which others flail about and cut themselves with.

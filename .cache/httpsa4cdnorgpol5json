The music and arts festival draws almost 100,000 people per day, according to Goldenvoice, including today&#039;s top performers and street-style stars. But every year, the thorn in the festival&#039;s side is appropriative fashion. From the overtly racist to the blindly ignorant, some Coachella attendees see festival fashion as the opportunity \u2014 knowingly or unknowingly \u2014 to demean cultures for Instagram likes.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Bindis, feathered headpieces, dashikis, war paint: Coachella street style is mired in cultural appropriation. And it&#039;s the kind that reeks of privilege. For South Asian women, bindis are a cultural symbol that represents the third eye, a sacred site of wisdom and spiritual development. For some Coachella attendees, it&#039;s just a pretty forehead accessory.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;A feathered headdress is nothing more than an eye-catching look for many festival-goers, but as Adrienne Keene writes on Native Appropriations, &quot;eagle feathers are presented as symbols of honor and respect and have to be earned,&quot; and they&#039;re traditionally worn by male chiefs in sacred ceremonies. But that doesn&#039;t mean anything to those Coachella attendees who don&#039;t respect other cultures. When you can&#039;t see the humanity in people who are different from you, you find no fault in treating their sacred cultural symbols as something to be worn and discarded.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Like fashion, appropriative hairstyles are now ubiquitous at Coachella. Cornrows or box braids are not a &quot;hot new festival trend&quot;; black women have been wearing them for centuries. When outlets cover the hairstyle as if it started with Kylie Jenner, it&#039;s not appreciation; it&#039;s erasure. Those celebratory headlines are yet another reminder that black hairstyles are only acceptable when they&#039;re removed from actual black people.<\/span>","filename":"a18","ext":".jpg","w":533,"h":477,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":223,"tim":1492462695722,"time":1492462695,"md5":"lofDmhArhrln1iWKr7d8GA==","fsize":22382,"resto":0,"id":"GGKawGM5","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"how-to-avoid-cultural-appropriation-at-coachella","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0},{"no":121581183,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)16:59:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"Won&#039;t surprise anyone this author is an SJW-indoctrinated black bitch.

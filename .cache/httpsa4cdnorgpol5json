For over 30 years, she lived in the Stockholm suburb of Tensta but says that she no longer feels safe there. She claims Muslim fundamentalists have taken over and she doesn\u2019t feel she can visit the centre of Tensta without being harassed, Swedish broadcaster SVT reports.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;According to Ms. Pekgul, the situation for women in public life in the area has deteriorated over the past several years. She noted that there has been a rise in religious fundamentalism amongst the men in the area, many of whom come from migrant backgrounds. Pekgul attempted to combat the trend by organising coffee shop meetings but soon abandoned the idea.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Aggression toward feminists, in particular, became an issue she said. \u201cThere were rumours that we wanted to take away women\u2019s veils,\u201d she said. \u201cThey said that I should keep myself, and then I did not feel so safe anymore.\u201d<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Dagli now lives in the inner city area of Stockholm and says she is happier that she can wear or say what she wants without fearing for her safety. She said she would consider returning to Husby, but only if the area became safer for her.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Sanandaji, a Kurdish Iranian immigrant, has been slammed by many in Sweden for his new book Mass Challenge which describes the problems Sweden has faced because of mass migration.

If you want any of your ideas to have any sort on mainstream appeal we must fully embrace civic nationlism even if we dont want it. It&#039;s the only realistic chance of defeating the jew. With the right propaganda it would be incredibly easy to turn blacks and hispanics against jews since they are easier to manipulate than whites. To defeat the enemy we must play the long game.","filename":"Download","ext":".jpg","w":286,"h":176,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":153,"tim":1490995753132,"time":1490995753,"md5":"G7RcXJ3SiyyiaylMwlnG4g==","fsize":8075,"resto":0,"id":"zktSWFbr","country":"DE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"its-time-pol-accepts-the-truth-truth-is-that","country_name":"Germany","replies":2,"images":2},{"no":119103187,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)17:36:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"(((you)))","filename":"1490922513834","ext":".jpg","w":809,"h":743,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":114,"tim":1490996172815,"time":1490996172,"md5":"M+wtEYhSFSLllDIcUeVTSQ==","fsize":364620,"resto":119102384,"id":"JIhgJyuy","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119103859,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)17:42:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;If you want any of your ideas to have any sort on mainstream appeal we must fully embrace civic nationlism even if we dont want it<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;thinks getting the current western general public to vouch for any sort of nationalism\/full-scale anti-semitism voluntarily would actually work<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;implying we can&#039;t just force certain nations to become ethnocentric by the sheer force of total authoritarianism<\/span><br><br>fucking kek","filename":"IMG_1602","ext":".jpg","w":980,"h":552,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1490996542646,"time":1490996542,"md5":"8AIhSqYsEgNT\/EJHnyzj7A==","fsize":154316,"resto":119102384,"id":"A9zkDQ4a","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":119102401,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)17:29:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;was my 25th birthday yesterday<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;told myself I&#039;d give up junk food and coffee and internet time wasting but I&#039;m having all three right now (can&#039;t resist McDonalds)<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;almost every day for the past few years consisted of me telling myself I&#039;d binge on junk food then eat cleanly and work very hard on learning tomorrow<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;literally had confidence in myself every time but always wasted my free time the next day<\/span><br><br>HOW do I get the motivation to work hard when there&#039;s no immediate pressure?

At first, everyone around me was talking and enjoying the evening. Kids were laughing and having fun. Then through the noise and the chatter, I heard the screaming.

I got there right as one of the little hands slipped of. A boy, about 5, was playing with the others when he went off exploring. He had found the edge of the grass, and on the other side a 12 foot drop into a creek that was roaring like a river due to the recent rain. He had slipped and started to fall when he grabbed onto to clumps of grass at the edge. 10 seconds later and he would have fallen and drowned. <br><br>I hoisted him up and returned him to his mother. <br><br>I was a fat guy, and I started running and working out partly because if an emergency ever arose I&#039;d be pretty fucking useless and make it worse.

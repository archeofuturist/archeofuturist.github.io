We put Christians in their place in the 90&#039;s and 2000&#039;s and we finally started seeing the demise of religion.

But as soon as Islam came along, the fucking liberals decided that criticizing, mocking, and joking about Islam is now racist for some reason. Remember all those Christian jokes we used to hear and see coming from the media? Literally just try saying those same jokes but with Mohammad instead of Jesus and you&#039;ll be labeled as a white supremacist.

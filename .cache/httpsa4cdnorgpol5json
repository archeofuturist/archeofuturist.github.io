He uses the example of a child for extra emotional impact. <br>There are a few arguments against this. <br>1. Earth is not heaven, we cannot be free of all suffering, the point in life is to suffer and struggle, only through this can we learn to help one another. Pain and suffering are not bad, they are tests not only of those going through pain but of everyone else and how we react to it. <br>2. The book of Job deals greatly with why God lets us suffer. In the book, the titular character has many monologues in which he is found expressing feelings of nihilism, anger towards God, etc. The kind of stuff most people feel on a day to day basis. The book ends with a vision from God. It espouses that the universe is far more complex than man can ever begin to comprehend. We will never understand why God would do the things that he does, certainly to us they may seem wrong, but ultimately we will never understand the sheer scale of the universe and why everything happens. <br>3. Harris is applying modernist ideas to religious philosophy. What I mean by this is that he believes that what is good is what is nice. Religious philosophy rejects this view.","time":1491643849,"resto":120098510,"id":"mBiQZD39","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120112375,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)05:36:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120111317\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120111317<\/a><br>&quot;Suffering and pain are bad! Why doesn&#039;t God help them all? This means God is not all powerful or just!&quot;<br>This is putting our limited view in front of God; suffering and pain can be a good cure for many evils. My grandmother died of cancer, yet by bearing it with patience and love she gave us an example of how pain can be a door to healing for others. <br>He also says &quot;God is unjust: these people were born in the wrong place and them punishes them, wtf!&quot;; not even us know if these people will be saved or doomed: the final judgement is up to Him, not to us (especially because in the Bible it says that the servant who doesn&#039;t know the rules of the Master will receive a lesser punishment of the one who knew). Harris makes the mistake of jusging God by the lense of the same culture which took from the world which was shaped by Christianity and then says &quot;we made all this by ourselves!&quot;. When he then speaks of narcisism, he does not understand Christianity: I had misery in my life, I was raped and yet I still believe, I care for others and I want to be a tool for Him. <br>The speech about &quot;slavery and witchcraft&quot; are the usual bollocks: the Church was the one who made the trials for witches, sure, but also gave them a defender, a proto-lawer, to speak in their behalf to try and save them. He is comparing also Islam to Christianity, apples and oranges (and no, killing in the name of God is not a good thing, it is an extreme tool and can be used only in a situation in which you must protect the weak or your own kin). Also the joke about the holy Host and th lack of miracles: there are still miracles happening here and there, and there&#039;s a well documented miracle about a &quot;cracker&quot; for the mass that tuned into blood and flesh. <br>Jesus opened a door, then it&#039;s up to us to walk into it, God never force us to save ourselves because He leaves us free.<br><br>He makes also the foolish mistake to say that Christianity is the same as the cults of the pagans who buried children alive.","time":1491644191,"resto":120098510,"id":"Lqq8U3I9","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120114758,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)06:09:32","name":"foxfire","com":"<a href=\"#p120098510\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120098510<\/a><br>definately an atheist it has noting to do with my political affiliation I was simpley born atheist when I saw religion latr in life I knew it was fucked up shit. suck my dick indeed god and while youre at it ream my ass","time":1491646172,"resto":120098510,"id":"cjVy8dCd","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":120113018,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)05:45:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"What&#039;s your opinion on him ?","filename":"image","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":473,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":236,"tim":1491644725143,"time":1491644725,"md5":"AYW68bZtLkZ+biKs5RRc6A==","fsize":70913,"resto":0,"id":"ohuvSPZ8","country":"FR","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"whats-your-opinion-on-him","country_name":"France","replies":37,"images":7,"omitted_posts":32,"omitted_images":7},{"no":120114499,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)06:05:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120114309\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120114309<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The most cucked Marshal went on to become King of Sweden<\/span><br><br>Pottery.","time":1491645954,"resto":120113018,"id":"r4CbtHNF","country":"MK","country_name":"Macedonia"},{"no":120114552,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)06:06:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120114141\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120114141<\/a><br>you were not relevant until germans did your biding<br>you are like the jews and it wouldn&#039;t suprise me if anglos were indeed the lost tribe","time":1491646001,"resto":120113018,"id":"PpSoo9kx","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":120114643,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)06:07:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120113018\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120113018<\/a><br><br>The last old-school conqueror in Europe, who was merely out to plunder, and pillage, and give more power and wealth to himself, his family, and his country - in that order - at the expense of everyone else, without genuinely buying his own propaganda about how he&#039;s just acting for some noble cause.<br><br>Still got too full of himself, tried to grab too much, and ultimately lost everything.","time":1491646079,"resto":120113018,"id":"lAXfGNrl","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":120114671,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)06:08:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120113018\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120113018<\/a><br>Just another pretentious fuck whose retarded foreign policy led to the death of millions of europeans","time":1491646099,"resto":120113018,"id":"iCDUHgls","country":"BG","country_name":"Bulgaria"},{"no":120114756,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)06:09:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120113018\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120113018<\/a><br>He gave the Jews citizenship and freed them from their ghettos?

I fear the same for other elections in Europe, in countries like France, like Germany, and others.<br><br>The question here is: after you elect them. What next? What exactly do they do?

And that uncertainty could prove to be his undoing, our undoing. The meme magic that got him elected is waning, and its influence on Europe is weakening. The left has already gained back some lost ground. Should the incumbent in the European countries notice this weakness and attack it, they may well stay in power, and our work will ultimately be for naught.

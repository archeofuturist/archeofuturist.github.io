Washington is gearing up to launch an offensive on the Islamic State&#039;s stronghold in Raqqa, a mission that could get sidetracked if Russian aircraft fly over the area. U.S. aircraft would have to take steps to avoid them, whether by changing course or aborting the mission. At worst, the Russians could also drop bombs near U.S. targets, forcing Washington to respond by shooting down Russian aircraft -- triggering a much larger flare-up between the two powers. Moscow could try to escalate conflicts elsewhere as well, including in eastern Ukraine, to try to improve its bargaining position with Washington. But this tactic may also run the risk of further souring the prospects of negotiation.<\/span><br><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Of course, the Trump administration&#039;s quick and decisive action in Syria was also designed to send a message to observers beyond the Middle East. As the threat of North Korean nuclearization grows, the move was meant to give Beijing and Pyongyang pause.

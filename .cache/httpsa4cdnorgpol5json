Liberty, THEY DID 9\/11. THEY DID IT. I have had long conversations over the past tow weeks with contacts at the Army War College, at the Headquarters Marine Corps, and I have made it absolutely clear in both cases that it is 100 PERCENT certain that 9\/11 was a MOSSAD OPERATION. Period. . .And the Zionists are playing this as truly an ALL or NOTHING exercise, because if the lose this one, IF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ever realize what happened, they\u2019re done.&quot; Dr Alan Sabosky, Ph.D, University of Michigan (Jewish ancestry) 10 year U.S. Marine Corps veteran and a graduate and former director of studies of the U.S. Army War College.","time":1493248146,"resto":122946536,"id":"WO\/CnnnE","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122955259,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)19:09:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"39. 9\/11 is a cover-up and World Trade Center 7 collapse is the smoking gun. Why is that so?? WTC-7 fully collapsed in a manner that resembles a controlled demolition and this building was not hit by any airplanes. For 2.25 seconds it collapsed at freefall and National Institute of Standards and Technology now admits this. In order for it to freefall for 2.25 seconds you need a uniform gap of approx. 80ft free of any physical impediments (equivalent of blowing out 7 floors almost instantaneously). Fire is not magic and cannot do that and only can be precisely done through human intervention.

Therefore, uranium and thorium atoms which animal life encounter rarely remain in the body long enough to decay, but plutonium concentrates in animals so it will likely decay inside them and cause damage. Potassium, an essential mineral with natural radioactivity, has a low decay energy, and our cellular repair mechanisms evolved specifically to fix the kind of damage it does.<br><br>Besides that, uranium and thorium have extremely long half-lives, on the order of a billion years, which means extremely low radioactivity.

By constantly stressing Christianity, you are:<br><br>-Making it seem like your ideology is based off of faith and not science, which will always get you labelled as the anti-intellectual side<br>-Associating yourself with a religion that has a history of denying evolution. This means that one of the best arguments for right-wingers now - racial realism - is now totally off the table. If you&#039;re not willing to argue that evolution has impacted isolated groups of human beings differently, then you have pretty much no grounds to stand on. In order for Western nationalism to succeed in the modern age you need to argue from a position of science, not religion.<br>-Giving the left the excuse to call themselves the &quot;pro-science&quot; side and thus they will always have the appeal of the intelligentsia and educational sector<br>-By being against abortion due to faith, you are alienating practically all modern women. If right wing parties want to have success they will need many more votes from women. 53% of white women will not be enough in the coming years.<br><br>So please, I don&#039;t get it.

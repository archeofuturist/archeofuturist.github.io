I think it lies somewhere in the middle between the two extremes of &quot;nope, fuck you, nothing to see here, not a single example of anything like this at all in history&quot; and &quot;The Podesta brothers and Clinton Family personally rape children they then murder as a sacrifice to Molech.&quot; If there ever is a case as described like that, I think it would be that they would use the child rape and murder as a binding secret between them so they can&#039;t turn on any other members of the group for any thing else done in the future. They&#039;re unified through doing the worst thing you can do. Perhaps religion\/ritual often surrounds these things to add formality purely to reduce the participants acknowledgment of how horrific it is to commit such acts.

What is legitimate and illegitimate is a very very hard question, and you have to look at it on a case by case basis. But maybe most broadly, we can think of an illegitimate hierarchy as one which is not justifiable, or can&#039;t withstand criticism. For example, a hierarchy which requires coercion to remain in place, is illegitimate. <br><br>When you ask about voluntary hierarchy, the answer I guess is again, I don&#039;t know, it depends. If someone with full knowledge and agency willfully submits to a hierarchy, I mean, whats the problem? If you have a problem with it and you wanted to stop them, I guess you would have to justify it somehow (since you making a decision FOR them constitutes you wielding power and authority over them, a hierarchy). Maybe there is a good reason why we should try and stop them.

I&#039;d say the population is 80% White - but is Browning at a rapid pace. The town is de-industrialized, and has a reputation of being composed of White trash. This has major implications. <br><br>Through a friend, who is a girl, I have discovered that more and more White women are, through social media, meeting foreign, Islamic men in Third World countries, flying over to such men, and marrying these men ON THE SPOT. The girl friend was offered thousands of dollars for doing so. Her friend did it for free, flies over to Pakistan, and expect her &quot;husband&quot; to come over here sometime in the near future. <br><br>I am disgusting - for a few reasons. 1) White women are literally marrying Islamic men, on the spot, without getting to know them, without fully understanding the Islamic religion, and likely converting, while forsaking White Western men and White Western Culture. They are permitting the conquest of this land, essentially, are a complicit in its conquering. 2) Men all around the West can&#039;t get White Western girlfriends, but White Western girlfriends will literally sell themselves to a foreign Islamic man for nothing - without even meeting this person. White Western women are marrying themselves off on the spot. This reveal the folly of Western people and liberalism. <br><br>Women are shapeless. They are chaotic and looking for order. Women must be strictly controlled. They must be dominated. If not, they will find somebody who will dominate them. We live in the Age of Great Deceit, and lies are the foundation of our social order. This is the Great Satan. This is absolutely insane. If we don&#039;t get a grasp, we are going to perish into oblivion - everything for which our fathers fought and died. <br><br>Liberalism is evil. It will consume us if we don&#039;t stop it.","filename":"barbary-slave-trade","ext":".jpg","w":554,"h":375,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":169,"tim":1490555573322,"time":1490555573,"md5":"vBClmKqWnsked5gbYNGq8A==","fsize":41410,"resto":0,"id":"wZiZxIHk","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"american-marrying-foreign-men","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":118396707,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)14:46:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"Is Drumpf actually religious or is he a fraud?","filename":"SHAREBLUE-folder21","ext":".png","w":1672,"h":984,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":147,"tim":1490553982611,"time":1490553982,"md5":"dBgUPL9GoCafzjHc8BzjWA==","fsize":1265307,"resto":0,"id":"ZcFcf3N4","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"is-drumpf-actually-religious-or-is-he-a-fraud","country_name":"United States","replies":11,"images":2,"omitted_posts":6,"omitted_images":1},{"no":118399178,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)15:06:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;can&#039;t quote a single verse of the Bible<\/span>","time":1490555185,"resto":118396707,"id":"VciALvLp","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":118399256,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)15:07:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118399178\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118399178<\/a><br>He barely even understands his own sentences how do you expect him to quote anything.","time":1490555223,"resto":118396707,"id":"p9eWnXvl","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118399260,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)15:07:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"A fraud.

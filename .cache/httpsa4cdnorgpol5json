They are vermin. Intelligent and capable vermin, who find themselves in influential positions in our society: Media, finance, academia, government, business, philanthropy. <br><br>They reach powerful positions in these institutions partly because of personal connections with fellow Jews, but more importantly on merit. Jews are smart, cunning, amoral, and will do whatever it takes to maintain these institutions&#039; death grip on the goyim.<br><br>The Jews aren&#039;t Christian. Even Western atheists are deeply influenced by Christian thought unconciously, whether they would like to admit it or not. <br><br>The Jews are a different breed entirely. They hold no deep values or principles. They are parasites upon whatever culture they plague. They must be eradicated from whatever society they infect. Most of all, our society. A society which has flourished like no other culture in human history, despite the Jews&#039; continual struggle to subjugate it.<br><br>We must remove Jewish control of our culture, or face extiction.","filename":"download (7)","ext":".png","w":307,"h":164,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":133,"tim":1493435033386,"time":1493435033,"md5":"jbRvzirmRBDWdmxRaF7C6A==","fsize":5435,"resto":0,"id":"cLFqX2DH","country":"US","bumplimit":1,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"i-finally-understand","country_name":"United States","replies":303,"images":80,"omitted_posts":298,"omitted_images":77,"tail_size":50},{"no":123297793,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)00:58:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123287241\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123287241<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;They reach powerful positions in these institutions partly because of personal connections with fellow Jews<\/span><br><br>Stopped reading there<br>it&#039;s IQ<br>And im truly sorry if you are inferior, natural selection is a bitch.","filename":"1493266914566m","ext":".jpg","w":731,"h":1024,"tn_w":89,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493441883723,"time":1493441883,"md5":"y+kJffCTdWdgR5nqRf3GQQ==","fsize":139522,"resto":123287241,"id":"NcvGJ+iA","country":"IL","country_name":"Israel"},{"no":123297797,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)00:58:06","name":"Anonymous","filename":"1493377437995s","ext":".jpg","w":125,"h":102,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":102,"tim":1493441886409,"time":1493441886,"md5":"3AC4vQX3jcUYKFrtRFpdmA==","fsize":3588,"resto":123287241,"id":"r\/sO5mZR","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123297901,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)00:59:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123297793\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123297793<\/a><br>nepotism is not based in IQ kike","time":1493441954,"resto":123287241,"id":"r\/sO5mZR","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123297904,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)00:59:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123297793\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123297793<\/a><br>Smart people would promote nepotism right?

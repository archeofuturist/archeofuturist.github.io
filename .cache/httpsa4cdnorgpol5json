For me, it screams of subjectivity and cherry-picking bias:<br><br> The chapters of the Bible are not inspired numbers; they were added later. The assignment of 45 to the chapter about Cyrus is manmade. To link this to the 45th president is arbitrary. (Or, what does Isaiah 44 say about Obama, US president #44? Oh, I&#039;m sure someone could find something that &quot;matches&quot; Obama in there\u2014which is exactly my point about how subjective this all is, instead of objective.)<br> There is nothing in the Bible about 777 unlike there is for 666. (Even 666 is specific to the name of the Antichrist and is not to be applied willy-nilly to other subjects.)<br> Even if there was instruction in the Bible to look for 777 neither 5777 or 70-7-7 are actual matches. Trump would have to be 7 (not 77) years old on the day of his inauguration to be a match, yes? Also, to be fair, we&#039;d have to time travel back 5000 years to make the year 777.<br><br>My point, if it&#039;s not plain already, is that apparent correlations are easily manufactured by our minds to prove any theory that we are predisposed to.

If Trump was installed by God like Nebuchadnezzar, then where is the prophet of God verifying this?<br><br>Oh, we have &quot;Christians prophets&quot; and &quot;Christian words&quot; saying Trump was chosen to be president by God to do big important things. Retired firefighter Mark Taylor claims God showed him in 2011 that Donald Trump would be president. He says God gave him a prophecy:<br><br> For I will use this man to bring honor, respect and restoration to America. America will be respected once again as the most powerful and prosperous nation on earth, (other than Israel). The dollar will be the strongest it has ever been in the history of the United States, and will once again be the currency by which all others are judged.<br><br>Lance Wallnau published a book in September, 2016 called Trump &quot;God&#039;s Chaos Candidate.&quot; In the book he says the Holy Spirit told him Donald Trump is &quot;anointed&quot; by God, like a Cyrus. Just as Cyrus did not know God but was used by God to bless his people Israel, likewise Trump is not a Christian but would be used by God as president to do good. It&#039;s unclear to me from Wallnau&#039;s interviews what that good would entail, something about waking up American Christianity and fixing other things in America.","time":1491602161,"resto":120023212,"id":"940G3fu9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120031558,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)17:56:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120023212\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120023212<\/a><br>Others have seized upon this Cyrus idea and say, like Cyrus specifically did, Trump will enable the Jews to rebuild their temple.<br>&quot;Let the Prophets Speak...and the Others Judge&quot; \u2014 1Cor 14:29<br><br>As Paul instructed the Corinthians, we are not to just accept in blind faith what Christian prophets say. We are to listen to them and then judge or scrutinize the prophecy because many false spirits have gone out into the world (1Jn 4:1).<br><br>How do we do this? There are several tests to discern a message. The most direct is when there is Scripture on the same topic. When someone makes a claim that does not line up with the written revelation of God, then it could not have come from God (Isaiah 8:20). Scripture &quot;trumps&quot; (pun intended) words and personal prophecy.<br><br>Another factor, as mentioned above, is that extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof. When Moses claimed to be sent to liberate the entire nation of Israel from slavery, they did not have to take his word for it. He was equipped by God with three signs: the ability to 1) turn water to blood, 2) turn his hand leprous and 3) turn his staff into a snake (Exodus 4:1-9). This established him beyond question as a prophet to those he was sent. Other prophets of the Bible made prophecies that came true or did miracles to establish they were sent by God.<br><br>This is the pattern of the Bible. God does not expect or want us to accept great claims without the great proof previous prophets could provide. Unless a proven, established prophet like Daniel or Isaiah declares that Trump has been set up by God as king like was done for Nebuchadnezzar (Dan 2) and Cyrus (Isaiah 45), respectively, then it is a suspect claim that deviates from the pattern of biblical revelation and biblical prophets.","time":1491602179,"resto":120023212,"id":"940G3fu9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120031745,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)17:57:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"Conclusion<br><br>For the reasons and Scripture cited above, I see no clear, unbiased evidence that God put Trump in power to bless the nation or even Christians\u2014although obviously God could and has in the past done so for other kings (Dan 2:21).

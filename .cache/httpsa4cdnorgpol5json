Far too many people around the world continue to be denied their most basic human rights simply because of the colour of their skin or their ethnic background.<br><br>\u201cThe Government of Canada strongly condemns any form of discrimination at home and in our global community. We will continue to promote inclusiveness, acceptance, and equality in Canada and around the globe, and will never stop working for a safer, more equal, and more respectful world. <br><br>\u201cOn this important day, we reaffirm our ongoing responsibility to speak out against racism, hate, xenophobia, and bigotry in all its forms.

Sweden will never be what it was before. It is an understanding of what the world actually looks like \u2013 that Sweden is needed as a safe place for people who need refuge. Some yearn back to how it used to be. It\u2019s okay to miss the past and it\u2019s okay to talk about it \u2013 but we have to seek ways forward, and find a way for everyone to live together. Because now we have a Europe and a Sweden that is what it is: in a state of change. It\u2019s time to realise that new Swedes will take up room with cultures, languages and customs, and it\u2019s time we see this as a positive force. The new country is about shaping a new future. Being Swedish needs to be about more than skin color and place of birth. It needs to be you, me and everyone together. It\u2019s not just new Swedes who need to integrate. Everyone needs to be integrated, established Swedes too. Integration does not mean that one party should adapt to the other, or that everyone should think, do and feel the same. Integration is about meetings, and real meetings are built on reciprocity. Let us create a future based on both realism and vision, in equal measure. Let\u2019s formulate a greater sense of \u201cwe\u201d and let\u2019s build a country where we put hatred and fears aside. We all have the new country within us; in our views, thoughts and actions. The time has come to build a country that is proud, inclusive and sustainable \u2013 something new.

While they are without doubt quite stupid and in some cases even agressive, I can honestly say I&#039;d prefer them over leftists and niggers any time. Why? As limited and retarded they are, the downies still have a heart and I dare say a soul. Leftists and niggers have neither and if you try talking to them their understanding and speaking comprehension is actually worse to downies.","filename":"th (12)","ext":".jpg","w":241,"h":160,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":82,"tim":1492170144088,"time":1492170144,"md5":"dMcxDkTtLRjICnUUMRpaOQ==","fsize":12902,"resto":121044409,"id":"9jiDRUL1","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"}]},{"posts":[{"no":121050793,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)07:42:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"Why not make English 100% germanic again?","filename":"1280px-2004_sutton_hoo_01","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":960,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1492170140459,"time":1492170140,"md5":"sWcj\/HZ7IU\/IOqeyi9FyzQ==","fsize":313429,"resto":0,"id":"qJVukFFC","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"why-not-make-english-100-germanic-again","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0},{"no":121050855,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)07:43:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121050793\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121050793<\/a><br><br>Here&#039;s some examples of what English would sound like it was 100% germanic.<br><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/IIo-17SIkws","time":1492170186,"resto":121050793,"id":"qJVukFFC","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":121046899,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)06:50:46","name":"Anonymous","sub":"\/skyking\/ SKYKANGZ GENERAL","com":"http:\/\/blerp2.dyndns.org:8901\/?tune<wbr>=8992usb<br>http:\/\/websdr.ewi.utwente.nl:8901\/?<wbr>tune=8992usb<br>USB 8992 for USAF frequency (already set)<br>Turn on Squelching to filter out noise<br><br>Skyking x1: It hasn&#039;t even begin<br>Skyking x2: It begins<br>skyking x3: You could have prevented this<br>Skyking x4: ITS HAPPENING<br><br>Theory is the more activity and more skykings the more serious and uncertain global conflicts.

He immediately launched one of the most ambitious programmes for social and economic change ever attempted on the African continent. To symbolize this new autonomy and rebirth, he renamed the country from the French colonial Upper Volta to Burkina Faso (&quot;Land of Upright Man&quot;). His foreign policies were centered on anti-imperialism, with his government eschewing all foreign aid, pushing for odious debt reduction, nationalizing all land and mineral wealth, and averting the power and influence of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank. His domestic policies were focused on preventing famine with agrarian self-sufficiency and land reform, prioritizing education with a nationwide literacy campaign, and promoting public health by vaccinating 2.5 million children against meningitis, yellow fever, and measles.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Sankara was assasinated in 1987, his body was dismembered and he was quickly buried in an unmarked grave, while his widow Mariam and two children fled the nation.

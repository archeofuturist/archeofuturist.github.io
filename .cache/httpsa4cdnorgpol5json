It would cost $500 billion, and cut your launch costs from $2000\/kg to $1\/kg. <br><br>A Launch Loop would cost $30 billion and cut your launch costs to $3\/kg. $30 billion is NASA&#039;s annual budget. Way easier to pull of politically.<br><br>They both reduce your costs by orders of magnitude,but a Launch Loop is cheaper and easier to engineer. Once it&#039;s up, we could put your homosexual Orbital Ring up for another $20 billion or so.<br><br>The Launch Loop still lets you mine asteroids and earn trillions of dollars, and it still lets you produce space-based solar power for under 1c\/kwh.That&#039;s so cheap they pay for themselves with 2-3 years.

If you knew me in real life, you would ridicule me to no end. I am much too liberal to fully be apart of your community, so I mostly lurk. However, I am very much interested in the protection of those with European descent. We as a people have been demonized and marked for death the past few years especially. It&#039;s only going to get worse unless action is taken. I am based in LA (yes go ahead and call me a fag) and am very immersed in the art scene. I know a lot of people. I know how anti-caucasian people think.. the arguments they use, etc. The hot button issue everyone is talking about is Islam, so of course that is my primary focus. I&#039;ll be blunt, it has no place in the west. The only Muslims I have known have actually been nice people, but the ideology, the passive behavior towards radicalists, and the fact that their religion permits them to lie to persuade or kill infidels is evidence enough that their ideology is incompatible with western societies. We need to organize and tackle these matters. I&#039;m talking about some heavy shit that may include arms dealing. This sounds really LARPy but someone needs to do it. A long term goal is a caucasian ethno-state, though at the moment that is unrealistic. Genocide and ethnic cleansing are not at all apart of my agenda. I have many friends of different ethnicities and orientations that I love dearly, but I also long for the caucasian people to live unmolested by the foreign hordes. I could see this thread getting deleted or meme&#039;d to death, but let&#039;s try and have a discussion anyways.","filename":"article-0-1975158400000578-382_634x802","ext":".jpg","w":634,"h":802,"tn_w":197,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491936328363,"time":1491936328,"md5":"5H2cWKW\/LqoASDb1gArD5w==","fsize":152852,"resto":0,"id":"J\/llRiZV","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"california-takes-action","country_name":"United States","replies":41,"images":11,"omitted_posts":36,"omitted_images":10},{"no":120643045,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)15:34:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120640896\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120640896<\/a><br>Yup.<br><br><a href=\"#p120635760\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120635760<\/a><br>You aren&#039;t liberal in the modern sense, OP.

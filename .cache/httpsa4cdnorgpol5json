Obsessions can cause harm, we can try to help people with them, but they are not themselves the problem, they are symptoms of something else.<br><br>That something else may not be a disorder, either: fragile self; guilt or shame; low or high self esteem; flawed but automatic assumptions, whatever-- but trying to &quot;treat&quot; internet addiction without addressing the underlying problem is like treating cancer with Tylenol. Not only does it not help, it actually makes the situation worse.<br><br>Dr. Block&#039;s intention was to describe a series of behaviors, not to create a new disease. He&#039;s already established believer in the positive power of the net, online games, etc. Unfortunately, psychiatrists will only see this editorial, and come to the wrong conclusions.<br><br>In the article he cites research from South Korea, where the average kid (supposedly) uses the internet 23 hours a week, and thus is at risk for addiction. Compare that to the U.S. 20 years ago, where the concern was 20+ hours of TV a week. I do not recall discussion about kids becoming addicted to TV; we worried they were becoming stupid. What&#039;s changed isn&#039;t the medium or the amount of time on it, or the harm to the intellect or society; what&#039;s changed is the social movement to pathologize, rather than condemn, behaviors.<br><br>I&#039;m not saying let&#039;s go back to condemnation, but to put &quot;Internet Addiction&quot; into the DSM legitimizes the symptom-is-disease approach that has caused such great difficulty for patients, and nearly irreparable harm to humanity.","filename":"spacedicks6","ext":".jpg","w":900,"h":1200,"tn_w":93,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491702222475,"time":1491702222,"md5":"qfwlk0qXPsVSLdWfPg3Gbw==","fsize":171864,"resto":120216872,"id":"sti\/wp41","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":120217898,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)21:46:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"Michael O Church: 3 Ladder System of Social Class -- https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/2012091<wbr>3042351\/http:\/\/michaelochurch.wordp<wbr>ress.com\/2012\/09\/09\/the-3-ladder-sy<wbr>stem-of-social-class-in-the-u-s<br><br>Typical depictions of social class in the United States posit a linear, ordered hierarchy. I\u2019ve actually come to the conclusion that there are 3 distinct ladders, with approximately four social classes on each. Additionally, there is an underclass of people not connected to any of the ladders, creating an unlucky 13th social class. I\u2019ll attempt to explain how this three-ladder system works, what it means, and also why it is a source of conflict. The ladders I will assign the names Labor, Gentry, and Elite. My specific percentage estimates of each category are not derived from anything other than estimation based on what I\u2019ve seen, and my limited understanding of the macroeconomics of income in the United States, so don\u2019t take them for more than an approximation. I\u2019ll assess the social role of each of these classes in order, from bottom to top.<br><br>This is, one should note, an exposition of social class rather than income. Therefore, in many cases, precise income criteria cannot be defined, because there\u2019s so much more involved. Class is more sociological in nature than wealth or income, and much harder to change. People can improve their incomes dramatically, but it\u2019s rare for a person to move more than one or two rungs in a lifetime. Social class determines how a person is perceived, that person\u2019s access to information, and what opportunities will be available to a person.","filename":"spacedicks1","ext":".png","w":397,"h":312,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":98,"tim":1491702383710,"time":1491702383,"md5":"R0lxdUWkkPblQiP\/c6sE\/g==","fsize":222247,"resto":120216872,"id":"sti\/wp41","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120218358,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)21:50:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"The Gervais Principle: https:\/\/www.ribbonfarm.com\/2009\/10\/<wbr>07\/the-gervais-principle-or-the-off<wbr>ice-according-to-the-office\/<br><br>I\u2019ll need to lay just a little bit of groundwork (lest you think this whole post is a riff based on cartoons) before I can get to the principle and my interpretation of The Office. I\u2019ll be basing this entire article on the American version of the show, which is more fully developed than the original British version, though the original is perhaps more satisfyingly bleak. Keep in mind that this is an interpretation of The Office as management science; the truth in the art. Literary\/artistic critics don\u2019t really seem to get it. I\u2019ll have some passing comments to offer on the comedy and art of it all, but this is primarily about the truths revealed by the show, pursued with Dwight-like earnestness.<br><br>Hugh MacLeod\u2019s cartoon is a pitch-perfect symbol of an unorthodox school of management based on the axiom that organizations don\u2019t suffer pathologies; they are intrinsically pathological constructs. Idealized organizations are not perfect. They are perfectly pathological. So while most most management literature is about striving relentlessly towards an ideal by executing organization theories completely, this school, which I\u2019ll call the Whyte school, would recommend that you do the bare minimum organizing to prevent chaos, and then stop. Let a natural, if declawed, individualist Darwinism operate beyond that point. The result is the MacLeod hierarchy. It may be horrible, but like democracy, it is the best you can do.","filename":"spacedicks10","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":600,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491702602399,"time":1491702602,"md5":"8KHkyDBpOusjH1RyNlBzgQ==","fsize":81008,"resto":120216872,"id":"sti\/wp41","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120219392,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)21:58:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120217103\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120217103<\/a><br><br>Sixteen Commandments of Poon: https:\/\/heartiste.wordpress.com\/the<wbr>-sixteen-commandments-of-poon\/ <br><br>(warning: written by a probable Jew. read only to understand that women are different)<br><br>The Sixteen Commandments Of Poon<br>I. Never say \u2018I Love You\u2019 first<br><br>Women want to feel like they have to overcome obstacles to win a man\u2019s heart. They crave the challenge of capturing the interest of a man who has other women competing for his attention, and eventually prevailing over his grudging reluctance to award his committed exclusivity. The man who gives his emotional world away too easily robs women of the satisfaction of earning his love. Though you may be in love with her, don\u2019t say it before she has said it. Show compassionate restraint for her need to struggle toward yin fulfillment. Inspire her to take the leap for you, and she\u2019ll return the favor a thousandfold.<br><br>II. Make her jealous<br><br>Flirt with other women in front of her. Do not dissuade other women from flirting with you. Women will never admit this but jealousy excites them.

The strongest woman and the most strident feminist wants to be led by, and to submit to, a more powerful man. Polarity is the core of a healthy loving relationship. She does not want the prerogative to walk all over you with her capricious demands and mercurial moods. Her emotions are a hurricane, her soul a saboteur.

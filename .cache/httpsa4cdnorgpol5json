Other research also shows a huge surge in growth for Christianity in China which is currently the world&#039;s most &quot;atheist&quot; nation because of the atheist communist government suppressing religion, the research suggests that China will soon become the world&#039;s most Christian nation within 15 years. <br><br>This is simply history repeating itself: Christianity prospered in Rome back in the ancient era when it was suppressed and it still grew in the militant atheist soviet Russia when it was suppressed there only a century ago with the majority of Russians today now also identifying as Christian. Just goes to show that atheist suppression of religion still doesn&#039;t stop religion.<br><br>Sources for the legion of whiny \/Redditor\/ fedoras that will no doubt show up it this thread:<br><br>http:\/\/www.pewforum.org\/2015\/04\/02\/<wbr>religious-projections-2010-2050\/<br>http:\/\/www.pewforum.org\/2012\/12\/18\/<wbr>global-religious-landscape-unaffili<wbr>ated\/<br>http:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/news\/wor<wbr>ldnews\/asia\/china\/10776023\/China-on<wbr>-course-to-become-worlds-most-Chris<wbr>tian-nation-within-15-years.html<br>http:\/\/masterrussian.com\/russia\/fac<wbr>ts.htm","filename":"1490142549767","ext":".jpg","w":608,"h":755,"tn_w":201,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491717426013,"time":1491717426,"md5":"gbLQR\/M\/TdWWLU+dYjIA+Q==","fsize":123410,"resto":0,"id":"W70I1Cgy","country":"PL","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"atheism-is-the-fastest-shrinking-religion-in-the","country_name":"Poland","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":120238951,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)00:43:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt; This angers, confuses and frightens Republicans<\/span>","filename":"Shareblue_Sample_02_Size_Anime_Frog_Girl","ext":".png","w":486,"h":442,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":227,"tim":1491713017044,"time":1491713017,"md5":"EM3j3ZS88foIh39qTo7nHA==","fsize":263761,"resto":0,"id":"arO12hGq","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"this-angers-confuses-and-frightens-republicans","country_name":"United States","replies":26,"images":5,"omitted_posts":21,"omitted_images":4},{"no":120246729,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)01:53:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120238951\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120238951<\/a><br>Capitalist claim to believe in freedom, but they don&#039;t believe in freedom to slave work for the revolution.","filename":"1488654827353","ext":".png","w":982,"h":980,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":124,"tim":1491717222293,"time":1491717222,"md5":"lsWVXSlMHSKIBKJjSjZFDQ==","fsize":826153,"resto":120238951,"id":"ovA7UNlW","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":120246774,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)01:54:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120238951\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120238951<\/a><br>Republicans claim to believe in freedom, but they don&#039;t believe in freedom to allow the government take their money by force","filename":"25c","ext":".jpg","w":484,"h":417,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":107,"tim":1491717254674,"time":1491717254,"md5":"ISk6iKmlsTb1rB8V1RkEoA==","fsize":46915,"resto":120238951,"id":"BUcrUimv","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120246895,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)01:55:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120238951\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120238951<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;freedom to being f o r c e d to buy healthcare<\/span><br><br>If i don&#039;t wish to participate in this system, the government will quite literally send the police with guns to haul me off against my will to jail.<br><br>Can you tell me that&#039;s freedom?<br><br>Universal Healthcare is the gun to the head of society that dictates you must subsidize the healthcare of those who cannot afford to pay it.

To native-speaking non-liberals, it only means &quot;sex.&quot; To liberals, it means whatever society thinks you are. By the latter definition, if you can convince society that you are something, then your gender is that thing. Multiple problems arise from this, however. That one&#039;s gender is meaningless without falsely equivocating it somehow to reality. One such false equivocation is calling one&#039;s gender what you are. Instead of &quot;My gender is a girl,&quot; one says &quot;I&#039;m a girl,&quot; which, if what society thinks you are isn&#039;t necessarily what you are, isn&#039;t necessarily the same thing. Another false equivocation is in the word &quot;gender&quot; itself. When a liberal speaks of their gender, normal people don&#039;t understand that they&#039;re talking about a fantasy, and instead understand &quot;gender&quot; as having basis in sex. Thus when the liberal speaks of their gender, they are committing an implicit false equivocation with &quot;sex,&quot; and are thus also falsely implying that their gender has basis in objective reality. The final problem is that most of these people take it upon themselves to impose what their gender is, based on their own opinion, not society&#039;s, which does not adhere to the liberal definition of gender. It would require a new definition: gender is whatever I say it is. Even with this definiton, though, gender has no basis in reality and instead relies on the same false equivocations to trick people into thinking otherwise.","time":1491717423,"resto":120240527,"id":"4pFvzSz9","country":"TH","country_name":"Thailand"}]},{"posts":[{"no":120244866,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)01:35:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"Is he the most powerful man in the world right now?","filename":"Jared-Kushner","ext":".jpg","w":1440,"h":960,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1491716140370,"time":1491716140,"md5":"puOP5B1HoSi1VhgiGYv8jg==","fsize":334730,"resto":0,"id":"suRmHy1K","country":"MX","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"is-he-the-most-powerful-man-in-the-world-right","country_name":"Mexico","replies":4,"images":2},{"no":120245015,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)01:37:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120244866\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120244866<\/a><br>According to Forbes, it&#039;s Putin #1 then Trump #2 because Putin has a lot more control over his country than Trump does.","time":1491716226,"resto":120244866,"id":"Ygs1714o","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120245546,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)01:42:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120245015\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120245015<\/a><br>That list is for public figures<br><br>(((they))) never appear in those lists","time":1491716534,"resto":120244866,"id":"suRmHy1K","country":"MX","country_name":"Mexico"},{"no":120245697,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)01:43:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120244866\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120244866<\/a><br>https:\/\/cryptome.org\/2016\/11\/fsil-k<wbr>ushner-dox.jpg<br><br>no","filename":"fsil-kushner-dox","ext":".jpg","w":1483,"h":2932,"tn_w":63,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491716615016,"time":1491716615,"md5":"neZSE4vW+zBvRqeGxdxN\/g==","fsize":995324,"resto":120244866,"id":"F7j0iSuN","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":120247052,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)01:57:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"He truly looks evil.","filename":"ivanka-trump-jared-kushner","ext":".jpg","w":1440,"h":960,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1491717420612,"time":1491717420,"md5":"IuhqVdiWbjJSABe4eS5gOg==","fsize":302096,"resto":120244866,"id":"8yR1HBwW","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":120245695,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)01:43:35","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Anti-Feminist Meme Thread","com":"Hey, guys.

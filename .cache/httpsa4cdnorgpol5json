But Goyne pledges to keep speaking out. \u201cThe gay cowboy will never be silenced,\u201d he said. \u201cI will forever be an openly gay cowboy. I will happily give a voice to those too scared to speak up.\u201d<br><br>In his Facebook video, Goyne sticks his neck out to stand up for other gay cowboys without a voice. \u201cThey think they\u2019re gonna stop me from riding in this week\u2019s rodeo\u2014not a chance in hell. I will proudly stand up to any homophobe and say right to their face that I\u2019m a proud openly gay cowboy.\u201d Goyne\u2019s activism has earned him a free trip to to the United States to compete in the \u201cTexas Tradition Rodeo,\u201d sponsored by the Texas Gay Rodeo Association.

If you&#039;re such an expert I don&#039;t have to spell it out for you, the mountain was implied with Qomhana. And Kafraa is a smaller mountain than Zayn al Abideen so once Zayn falls that one will be easier.<br><br>They are not salienting you idiot, they took Kawkab and will likely capture the whole terrain up until Zoghba. They are also moving north of Mhardeh towards Kernaz. The salient is Khattab but that&#039;s just to buttress the main assault from the north. <br><br>And then al Bab was only a salient thanks to SDF and SAA blocking the sides, and while that was awkward rebels have the advantage of Rastan for Hama.<br><br>Lastly, the rebels did not go for Hama before for many reasons, one was the lack of unity, experience and foreign support - Erdogan wanted Aleppo as it was on his border so rebels wasted four years there. Another reason is that Idlib was still not liberated so rebels were tied up. The 2014 Kessab and Hama offensives failed but had the effect of liberating Khan Sheikhoun and besieging Wadi Deif, which then fell and was followed by the rest of Idlib. Then in summer 2015 while they were winning, rebels planned to attack Hama from Qomhana and the airport as well but were distracted by Russia in Aleppo and Latakia, then by Jund al Aqsa and infighting. It&#039;s a bit late now but the moment is finally here, it&#039;s do or die, victory or martyrdom.","time":1490256542,"resto":117847188,"id":"xA3IWg+9","country":"AE","country_name":"United Arab Emirates"},{"no":117906642,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)04:10:51","name":"Countryside General","com":"<a href=\"#p117905475\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117905475<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;you know the dog story<\/span><br><br>Why did I even mention it here I don&#039;t remember <br><br>I really had fun here didn&#039;t I?","time":1490256651,"resto":117847188,"id":"xA3IWg+9","country":"AE","country_name":"United Arab Emirates"}]},{"posts":[{"no":117905983,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)04:01:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"when were you when \/pol\/ was btfo?","filename":"e0f570fd596a7b35ff5c6e164097db63","ext":".png","w":321,"h":376,"tn_w":213,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490256095466,"time":1490256095,"md5":"4PVw\/VlqezX\/XG4WQJfbYw==","fsize":176125,"resto":0,"id":"ZEa6rLCy","country":"KZ","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"when-were-you-when-pol-was-btfo","country_name":"Kazakhstan","replies":5,"images":2},{"no":117906053,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)04:02:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"- REMINDER TO PUT SAGE IN OPTIONS FIELD IN SLIDE &amp;

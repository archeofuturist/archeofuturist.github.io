Example: I go a week of eating healthy\/lifting. I gradually get stressed out about this throughout the week. On my weekend I allow myself the &quot;reward&quot; of gorging myself on pizza donuts and ice cream. Afterwards instead of feeling happier\/less stressed I actually feel let down and depressed.<br><br>If my goals are things like: go to college, get fit, effectively use my time, create art, then why are my dopaminergic reward systems not tied to those goals, and are instead associating that behavior with stress or anxiety? I TRULY want those things. I truly want to be that person. So why are my emotions not tied into those things the way you would expect? Does my brain require more time to rewire itself? I don&#039;t understand why my brain is associating the things I actually want in life with negativity.

A real goal, like running a 5k in a certain time or hitting a specific weight. Once you have that goal, put real effort into sticking to your goal; keep records of your shit and plan out your schedule around your goals. Keeping yourself accountable is a priority if you are looking for success, so set a reminder in the morning to stick to your schedule or ask another anon to remind you of your goals.

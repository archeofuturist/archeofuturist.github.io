Especially where Jesus tells you to sell everything you own and give it to the poor, and where He says that you can&#039;t be His disciple (a real Christian, one worthy of resurrection and eternal life) unless you forsake everything you have. About your fallacy detector going off, remember this: to Christians, their prophet, who we believe to be the Son of God is the standard for all Christians. So He can say who is true and who is false. Christians are supposed to be loving towards all men, even their enemies. Now anyway, back to the doubt. I had all the doubt this would even work, but I found a YouTube channel describing this very teaching of forsaking all to live in community with other Christians. I got in touch with the man running the channel, who has done this command and has been for 30 years, and he got me in touch with a few people who are trying to organize a community of people willing to forsake their old lives for new ones. So I figured this must work, and God must be doing something good if he&#039;s kept a 70 year old man alive for 30 years of living on the streets.","time":1492179807,"resto":121057987,"id":"OGgzJ3ln","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121065768,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)10:27:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121064244\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121064244<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;exaggerating things that may have seemed remarkable to people with practically no understanding of the natural world.<\/span><br>Oddly enough, reading the book of Enoch with exactly this in mind is what got me on the path to believing.","time":1492180045,"resto":121057987,"id":"Izcum9Sm","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121066961,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)10:38:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121057987\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121057987<\/a><br>Why does everyone here think they have to censor the word &quot;God&quot;?","time":1492180713,"resto":121057987,"id":"a3NgwGtv","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121067212,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)10:41:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121062214\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121062214<\/a><br>The logic is not that simple.

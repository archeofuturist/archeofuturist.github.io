Now I read a book and forget everything in it as soon as I put it down.

Ask me about a fiction book I read a year ago and I would be able to tell you literally nothing about it. Non-fiction, I remember maybe a few facts out of the whole thing, and even then I remember them incorrectly. I can still remember conversations and events just like before though, just not media.

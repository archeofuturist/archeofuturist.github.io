There are now many different groups that white Americans actively hate on, which is why they find racially ambiguous minorities to be a convenient scapegoat to take out their vague xenophobia and racism on. After Muslims commit terrorist attacks, it is commonplace for white Americans to commit hate crimes on Indians and Sikhs because they are indistinguishable from Muslims to most Americans. But hapas are in an even worse situation because they can be mistaken for literally any ambiguously brown enemy by most whites. The situation for young hapa boys growing up is going to be even worse than most of us here experienced, and I really fear for the future and the inevitable hapacolypse. You can expect this is what will happen to hapa boys when another minority commits a crime. They will be the literal whipping boys of American society.<br><br>When Jihadists commit a terrorist attack: white bullies find nearest hapa boy, call him a raghead, and beat him up while pouring bacon grease on him<br><br>When illegal hispanic immigrants commit a crime: white bullies find nearest hapa boy, call him a wetback, string him up a tree like a pinata, and beat the shit out of him<br><br>When Russia hacks into American servers and threatens nuclear war: white bullies find the nearest hapa boy, call him a Soviet spy, call the police on him while holding him down and pouring vodka in his eyes<br><br>And of course when manufacturing and tech jobs are outsourced to China: disgruntled out of work white men will find the nearest hapa boy (if they can&#039;t find a full Asian) and beat him to death with a baseball bat like Vincent Chin while calling him anti-Asian racial slurs. Later, when the white men are on trial for murder, they&#039;ll defend themselves by saying, &quot;I&#039;m not racist. My wife is Asian,&quot; as their Asian wives with two black eyes look on and get off with a slap on the wrist.

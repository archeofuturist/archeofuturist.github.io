Either Bannon shoots him down or the constant globalist nagging makes Trump reevaluate his worth as the guy who&#039;s suppose to counter bad media publicity and keep AIPAC out of his way. To get around these obstacles, he uses Ivanka. This is why msm is so hellbent on getting Bannon out of the way and so oddly silent about Kushner. There&#039;s two ways to neutralize him:<br><br>1) Attack his businesses and connections as a distraction. There&#039;s no way in hell he has divested completely from his real estate and media holdings. Dig up connections and keep posting them. Spread rumors about potentially disastrous decisions with his business assets to scare off investors. Force him to publicly intervene and possibly trip up all sorts of conflict of interest flags. Best case scenario is an orchestrated media attack campaign that forces msm to start reporting it. <br><br>2) Bombard Ivanka&#039;s personal and media contacts with news of Israeli atrocities against Palestinian children. Point out the hypocrisy of her pleading with daddy to bomb Syria over some kids getting gassed while continuing to send aid to Israel while they shoot and bomb Palestinian children etc etc. Now I ain&#039;t no mudslime Palestinian sympathizer but what we need is to drive a political wedge between her and hubby. At best, he&#039;ll be more reluctant to try and use her to promote his globalist agenda at the risk of drawing parallels on Israel&#039;s actions.","time":1493354158,"resto":123128928,"id":"F2kVLNgG","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123149432,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)00:52:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123131363\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123131363<\/a><br>Kushner knows exactly what&#039;s up though.

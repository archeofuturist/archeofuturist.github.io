He was self conscious, went through some bullying and rejection by girls and peers. He lacked social skills and would do things spontaneous, like joining a college because he thought it was good and had alot of girls;when he went there, he didn&#039;t talk to anyone and left after not accomplishing his girlfriend goal. I think having no bond with his family, which is why he felt like he could kill his stepmom &amp; brother. The woman in his life belittled him, the dad didn&#039;t teach him life skills and how to be a man and people rejected him.

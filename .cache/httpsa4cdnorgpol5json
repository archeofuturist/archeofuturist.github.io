Random acts of terror (Even against good targets) are bad not just for optics, but more importantly they are ineffective. America is not Afghanistan. Our domestic counter-terror and police forces are brutally effective. For every terror attack that happens in America dozens and dozens are stopped. You might think, &quot;Oh those are dumb kebabs though, whites can do better&quot;, and you may be right, but the odds are still against you. <br><br>But political parties are equally doomed. Infiltrating the Republicans may have some use in the interest of prolonging the white majority and changing cultural norms, but it will never be enough.<br><br>So what then?<br><br>Build parallel societies. This includes off-grid living, but is not limited to it. Building communities, networks of families (And I do mean families, not all single men) that support each other and can be trusted. Creating nationalist villages, safe, legal, but armed and ready, is the future for National Socialism, and greater White Nationalism, if it is to succeed. Promote good ideals, and practice them. Be a man (or woman) that others want to be like. Pillars of the community are models for others to follow. Be one. Local politics, unlike federal politics, are fair game and do have potential. The revolution will not be a coup d&#039;etat, it will not be a regional civil war like the 1860s, it will be largely rural vs. urban, it will be guerilla, and it will be fought by good people. Be one of those good people. Go to church (even if you&#039;re a LARPagan). Get married. Have children. Be involved in your community. Volunteer. Organize. Be such a good white citizen that your nationalism is not a disgrace to you but a grace to the ideology. Like-minded people will find you, and you will find them. Build cvillages, towns, societies that are not dependent on the government. Don&#039;t call 911, call each other. Don&#039;t go on welfare, rely on each other. Our blood and soil is our destiny.","time":1493750552,"resto":123771963,"id":"iapwUrJl","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123801399,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)14:43:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123801177\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123801177<\/a><br>Tell me boy.","time":1493750586,"resto":123771963,"id":"SiQrxrSv","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"}]},{"posts":[{"no":123798369,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)14:21:20","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Clinton takes &quot;personal responsibility&quot; for election loss","com":"Clinton takes &quot;personal responsibility&quot; for her loss, says &quot;I was on the way to winning&quot; before Comey letter and Wikileaks interference.","filename":"VotersScaredOff","ext":".png","w":605,"h":707,"tn_w":213,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493749280804,"time":1493749280,"md5":"UrMG+MgVKB2z+ZXZJ5balQ==","fsize":324941,"resto":0,"id":"hAThfxyz","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"clinton-takes-personal-responsibility-for","country_name":"United States","replies":39,"images":8,"omitted_posts":34,"omitted_images":6},{"no":123801193,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)14:41:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123798369\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123798369<\/a>","filename":"LynnHatesPodesta","ext":".png","w":1025,"h":726,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":88,"tim":1493750481983,"time":1493750481,"md5":"4Onx\/8Zv6NAkRGaQO16WBw==","fsize":317187,"resto":123798369,"id":"S47nEKcH","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123801220,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)14:41:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123798369\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123798369<\/a><br><br>Look at her face, the visage of a worn old woman that knows she got defeated with a side of lust for revenge in her demeanor.","time":1493750495,"resto":123798369,"id":"H+sy+BPX","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123801230,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)14:41:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;I woulda got away with it too if not for that pesky Comey!<\/span>","time":1493750498,"resto":123798369,"id":"TRGIOj0B","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123801260,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)14:41:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123799190\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123799190<\/a><br>Kek, exactly what I was thinking.

One might be fooled by temporary victory with President Trump, however he is not willing to take the necessary actions. Trumps son in law is literally funded by the same Jewish scum that funds hillary, other top dems., the top reps., and much more. Say what you want about Christianity but it is a core aspect of Western Civilization. Jewish media in both the Weimar Republic and the USA today promotes the degradation of Western values, and much more. I literally cannot think of a better parallel. Hindenburg was a popular conservative president just like trump is, however both of them still cannot escape the hooks of the Jews. I dont think we need to worry about the plebeian tear jews so much as the very powerful Jews. The USA is on the same downward spiral that the Weimar Republic was caught in.

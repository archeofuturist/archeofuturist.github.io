Some of you might remember a bunch of \u201cnews reports\u201d about a Sony video camera that could \u201cx-ray\u201d clothes \u2013 this is the effect we are talking about. Now, there are two steps to making one of these at home: 1) remove the IR filter on the camera, and 2) filtering the visible light so that the IR dominates the image.<br>For the first, I recommend this tutorial: [spoiler]<br>https:\/[\/spoiler]\/www.youtube.com\/w<wbr>atch?v=mUtoLBOego4<br>It uses a ~$60 &quot;action camera&quot; clone of the gopro which should have good mounting options for your protest gear.<br>Next, reassemble the camera and glue this: https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B00XU8SHE<wbr>0\/ref=twister_B01DA1ASWU?_encoding=<wbr>UTF8&amp;psc=1#customerReviews over the lens, as close as you can get it to the lens housing. <br>There you go. For less than $100 you should have a basic infrared camera that can see through some clothing. Here&#039;s a video demo of how it works: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=7UB<wbr>bjwPnW1E <br>It&#039;s not perfect, obviously, nor will it unmask every antifa you catch on camera, but it should be able to give our doxsquads more to go on and preserve more evidence for later use. More importantly, antifa won&#039;t know if their masks are protecting them or not. As we saw at Auburn, unmasking them sends them running immediately. I think the psychological aspect may be more potent than the information gathering.","filename":"IMG_0680","ext":".jpg","w":1000,"h":700,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":175,"tim":1492861328166,"time":1492861328,"md5":"NqpztYMGJ3YMTHu5zlWjyg==","fsize":746614,"resto":0,"id":"qAFRaL89","country":"AU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"unmasking-antifa","country_name":"Australia","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":122256160,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)04:51:55","name":"Anonymous","sub":"ANTIFA

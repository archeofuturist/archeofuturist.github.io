Lawyers representing Dow, whose CEO is a close adviser to Trump, and two other manufacturers of organophosphates sent letters last week to the heads of three of Trump&#039;s Cabinet agencies. The companies asked them &quot;to set aside&quot; the results of government studies the companies contend are fundamentally flawed.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Dow Chemical wrote a $1 million check to help underwrite Trump&#039;s inaugural festivities, and its chairman and CEO, Andrew Liveris, heads a White House manufacturing working group. The industry&#039;s request comes after EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt announced last month he was reversing an Obama-era effort to bar the use of Dow&#039;s chlorpyrifos pesticide on food after recent peer-reviewed studies found that even tiny levels of exposure could hinder the development of children&#039;s brains.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Over the past four years, government scientists have compiled an official record running more than 10,000 pages indicating the three pesticides under review \u2014 chlorpyrifos, diazinon and malathion \u2014 pose a risk to nearly every endangered species they studied. Regulators at the three federal agencies, which share responsibilities for enforcing the Endangered Species Act, are close to issuing findings expected to result in new limits on how and where the highly toxic pesticides can be used.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The EPA&#039;s recent biological evaluation of chlorpyrifos found the pesticide is &quot;likely to adversely affect&quot; 1,778 of the 1,835 animals and plants accessed as part of its study, including critically endangered or threatened species of frogs, fish, birds and mammals. Similar results were shown for malathion and diazinon.<\/span>","filename":"Dow-chemical","ext":".jpg","w":540,"h":360,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1492805121887,"time":1492805121,"md5":"jjpEo1EbrC289PiyltccDQ==","fsize":31603,"resto":0,"id":"RUKNU1eQ","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"dow-lobbies-trump-to-bury-pesticide-study","country_name":"United States","replies":3,"images":1},{"no":122177915,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)16:05:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122177890\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122177890<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In a statement, the Dow subsidiary that sells chlorpyrifos said its lawyers asked for the EPA&#039;s biological assessment to be withdrawn because its &quot;scientific basis was not reliable.&quot; FMC Corp., which sells malathion, said the withdrawal of the EPA studies would allow the necessary time for the &quot;best available&quot; scientific data to be compiled. &quot;Malathion is a critical tool in protecting agriculture from damaging pests,&quot; the company said.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Brett Hartl, government affairs director for the Center for Biological Diversity, said Dow&#039;s experts were trying to hold EPA scientists to an unrealistic standard of data collection that could only be achieved under &quot;perfect laboratory conditions.&quot; &quot;You can&#039;t just take an endangered fish out of the wild, take it to the lab and then expose it to enough pesticides until it dies to get that sort of data,&quot; Hartl said. &quot;It&#039;s wrong morally, and it&#039;s illegal.&quot;<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Organophosphorus gas was originally developed as a chemical weapon by Nazi Germany. Dow has been selling Chlorpyrifos for spraying on citrus fruits, apples, cherries and other crops since the 1960s. It is among the most widely used agricultural pesticides in the United States, with Dow selling about 5 million pounds domestically each year.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;As a result, traces of the chemical are commonly found in sources of drinking water. A 2012 study at the University of California at Berkeley found that 87 percent of umbilical-cord blood samples tested from newborn babies contained detectable levels of chlorpyrifos. In 2005, the Bush administration ordered an end to residential use of diazinon to kill yard pests such as ants and grub worms after determining that it poses a human health risk, particularly to children. However it is still approved for use by farmers, who spray it on fruits and vegetables.<\/span>","time":1492805137,"resto":122177890,"id":"RUKNU1eQ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122178448,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)16:10:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122177890\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122177890<\/a><br>I don&#039;t care.

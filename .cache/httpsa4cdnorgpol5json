They will never tell you unless you ask. They say their thanks before and after meals. They make their offerings to the gods and to the dead. They take part in festivals and funerals and observe all holidays. They visit shrines and temples and pay their respects. They respect the Emperor and the priesthoods. They even pray to the kami. They do not believe, but they do these things anyway. They do this because the recognize that these things are in themselves valuable and worthwhile and beautiful. In the West all atheists are utterly insufferable bigots who live empty lives scoffing and sneering at the religion they have rejected yet don&#039;t even understand. It is because there all atheists consider themselves in their hearts foremost apostates and heretics of Christianity, and so they have the bitterness of a failed spirit, and the insolence of a heretic. If they could get over their own arrogance and defensiveness and take part in the spiritual life of their nation despite their pride they would not be this way. In the end you can say they have replaced the Christian God with merely their own ego, and their behaviour demonstrates this.

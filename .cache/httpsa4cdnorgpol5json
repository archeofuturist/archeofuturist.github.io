It is named after the site of La Gravette in the Dordogne region of France where its characteristic tools were first found and studied. The earliest signs of the culture were found at Kozarnika, Bulgaria. One of the earliest artifacts is found in eastern Crimea (Buran-Kaya) (see Crimean Mountains) dated 32,000 years ago. It lasted until 22,000 years ago. Where found, it succeeded the artifacts datable to the Aurignacian culture.<br><br>In August 2013, Romanian archaeologists found a 20,000-year-old Gravettian pendant at the Paleolithic site of Poiana Ciresului (English: &#039;Cherry Glade&#039;), near Piatra Neam\u021b, in eastern Romania. The newly discovered objects will be included in the Paleolithic artifacts collection of the T\u00e2rgovi\u0219te History Museum, in the new section of human evolution. <br><br>The diagnostic characteristic artifacts of the industry are small pointed restruck blade with a blunt but straight back, a carving tool known as a burin. Artistic achievements of the Gravettian cultural stage include hundreds of Venus figurines, which are widely distributed in Europe. <br><br>Gravettian culture is a phase (c. 32,000\u201322,000 ya) of the European Upper Paleolithic that is characterized by a stone-tool industry with small pointed blades used for big-game hunting (bison, horse, reindeer and mammoth). People in the Gravettian period used nets to hunt small game. <br><br>Artifacts and technologies of this and the preceding Aurignacian culture figure centrally in the romanticized adaptation of the culture in the popular fictive prehistory depicted in the Earth&#039;s Children novel series which leans heavily on archeological finds and theories from this era. In the series, the Venus figurines are central to a fertility rite and worship of &quot;The Great Earth Mother,&quot; a spirit from which all life flows.","filename":"Haplogroup_I-borders","ext":".gif","w":800,"h":581,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":90,"tim":1492018508569,"time":1492018508,"md5":"OR98IS8wySAGxQZ9P2C95w==","fsize":96541,"resto":120761827,"id":"vueaWZqN","country":"RO","country_name":"Romania"},{"no":120782882,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)13:46:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120781403\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120781403<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;If there is such a thing like pottery, then this fucking thread should be it.<\/span><br><br>Jewelry too.

It\u2019s not a fucking puzzle, all the history is on the sites. There you crossed ur nerdy hobbies with ur nerdy resentment. Bunch of fucking nerds with your dipshit teenage beefs probably started with a resentment of woman who won\u2019t speak to you and now you think you have become POI radicalized.<br>So how did it happen? How did you become a fucking nazi? A bunch of real Nazis whispered poison in your ears while becoming your only community, your only \u201cfriends\u201d. And they used multiple levels to make irony and bigotry and fascism more acceptable by drowning it in \u201coh we\u2019re just joking\u201d So you combine all this with capitalizing on isolated nerd dude resentment and even deeper isolation, BAM nazi.<br>You can talk to any former \u201cchan\u201d boy and they can tell you how it went from \u201cshotty shock humor\u201d to \u201cwhite supremacist recruitment\u201d. The \u201clol only normies care about hurting others attitude\u201d + the general nerd male resentment of these communities. Its prime fertile ground for actual Nazis to grow. People talk about pol, but you need to see the various communities converge. R9K\u2019s \u201cwho wont woman fuck me\u201d bs \u201canything goes and anyone who gets mad is just a normie\u201d vs endless outbursts of anger at everything. Pol here becomes less of an isolated phenomenon and more of a natural end point for all these circles crashing into one another. And pol, also being its own thing, emans it is rolled back into those communities amplifying your worst aspect then roll it back into pol.<br>So essentially you have an online pressure cooker to turn your typical teenage nerdy bullshit into honest to god fascism. The surrounding of hateful idedas, the detachment from the harm you do? Turning them into \u201cjust jokes\u201d becoming your only friends and that just your community you can see it in many others but again your not a fucking mystery.","filename":"image","ext":".jpg","w":550,"h":550,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492019038016,"time":1492019038,"md5":"rJvbFojloq84ig4JSQeztw==","fsize":101734,"resto":0,"id":"rcUXTKKh","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"im-sick-of-you-fucking-nazis","country_name":"United States","replies":18,"images":7,"omitted_posts":13,"omitted_images":5},{"no":120784825,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)14:02:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120782618\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120782618<\/a><br><br>You post like a redditor.","time":1492020163,"resto":120782618,"id":"+dtGwCzC","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120785070,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)14:04:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120782618\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120782618<\/a><br>Hope you read what I&#039;ll say cause I won&#039;t actually attack you or anything.<br><br>It is true that now that I stand at the dawn of my adult life, my past few years have been filled with sh!t, I&#039;m a small, rejected loner, the girl I fell in love with (Pretty dense sh!t) broke my heart and now I spend my days wallowing in my misery and pain, alone; unable to enjoy anything, and yes - sometimes, angry and full of resentment.

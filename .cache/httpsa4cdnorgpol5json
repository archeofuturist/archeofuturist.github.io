It&#039;s still the minority and a declining one at that. <br><br>The Pew Research Center&#039;s statistics show that atheism is expected to continue to decline all the way into 2050 with a continued growth of religion. Other research also shows a huge surge in growth for Christianity in China which is currently the world&#039;s most &quot;atheist&quot; nation because of the atheist communist government suppressing religion, the research suggests that China will soon become the world&#039;s most Christian nation within 15 years. <br><br>This is simply history repeating itself: Christianity prospered in Rome back in the ancient era when it was suppressed and it still grew in the militant atheist soviet Russia when it was suppressed there only a century ago with the majority of Russians today now also identifying as Christian. Just goes to show that atheist suppression of religion still doesn&#039;t stop religion.<br><br>Sources for the legion of whiny \/Redditor\/ fedoras that will no doubt show up it this thread:<br><br>http:\/\/www.pewforum.org\/2015\/04\/02\/<wbr>religious-projections-2010-2050\/<br>http:\/\/www.pewforum.org\/2012\/12\/18\/<wbr>global-religious-landscape-unaffili<wbr>ated\/<br>http:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/news\/wor<wbr>ldnews\/asia\/china\/10776023\/China-on<wbr>-course-to-become-worlds-most-Chris<wbr>tian-nation-within-15-years.html<br>http:\/\/masterrussian.com\/russia\/fac<wbr>ts.htm","filename":"1490142549767","ext":".jpg","w":608,"h":755,"tn_w":201,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491752108096,"time":1491752108,"md5":"gbLQR\/M\/TdWWLU+dYjIA+Q==","fsize":123410,"resto":0,"id":"uO0N+ysf","country":"PL","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"atheism-is-the-fastest-shrinking-religion-in-the","country_name":"Poland","replies":26,"images":14,"omitted_posts":21,"omitted_images":12},{"no":120297220,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)11:58:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120294419\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120294419<\/a><br>so what youre trying to say is the world is getting stupider?","time":1491753497,"resto":120294419,"id":"wqK+2Wwi","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120297366,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)11:59:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120297220\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120297220<\/a>","filename":"1490312688959","ext":".jpg","w":900,"h":948,"tn_w":118,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491753568580,"time":1491753568,"md5":"PaHQeoTIh0W+SAojAIgfmg==","fsize":89364,"resto":120294419,"id":"mKR0CA\/s","country":"CL","country_name":"Chile"},{"no":120297756,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)12:02:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120297366\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120297366<\/a>","filename":"image","ext":".png","w":1440,"h":1440,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491753754862,"time":1491753754,"md5":"c5Fy9cMIkRgvugqzhEuVqQ==","fsize":533942,"resto":120294419,"id":"7LR5hlj3","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":120298284,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)12:07:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120297756\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120297756<\/a>","filename":"2e8","ext":".jpg","w":829,"h":589,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":88,"tim":1491754036728,"time":1491754036,"md5":"JZezCErlBjcUyuH2pJ89gA==","fsize":94178,"resto":120294419,"id":"mKR0CA\/s","country":"CL","country_name":"Chile"},{"no":120299007,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)12:13:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120298284\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120298284<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Posts another fedora meme and proves the image correct <\/span><br>Kek","time":1491754389,"resto":120294419,"id":"7LR5hlj3","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":120283492,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)09:45:34","name":"Anonymous","sub":"T_D is delusional as fuck","com":"How can any sane American still support Trump?

These are usually &quot;crazy&quot; sites but I DID find a few OBSCURE MSM articles that somewhat confirm what the crazy sites are saying.

Also on the other hand, a welfare program for those who can&#039;t work to subsidize the costs should be instituted.<br>Insurance is gambling. Which is under prohibition.

That&#039;s why you join an insurance group. A for-profit company that stands to finance can only remove money from the system adding cost to the buyer. It is not a hedge it is a gamble. More likely than not stand to lose more than you will gain. You are quite literally betting bi-monthly via subscription that eventually you will be sick enough to require Health Care. The insurance company is gambling that within your group, the total some of premiums paid will be enough to offset the risk of having to pay out for healthcare in the event a couple of people in the group get sick. There is a good chance that you will never see a return on the investment of insurance especially with a disaster plan. In fact that actually needs to happen in order for a insurance company to be for-profit.

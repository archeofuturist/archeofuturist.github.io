We have quite a laugh at you CHAPS here across THE POND, how you pat each other on the back at every opportunity!! ... I was Captain of the infamous OXFORD UNIVERSITY FENCING TEAM! A gentleman&#039;s sport which takes brains as well as brawn. I was Lightweight Amateur Champion that year. Unfortunately, while on a book signing tour I injured my wrist and was unable to continue or pursue a professional career. I subsequently entered the NOTTINGHAM CUP Rose GARDENING Championships and placed second, which was quite the coup for a novice. If any of you are ever lucky enough to take a guided bus tour of OXFORD UNIVERSITY, go to the GREAT HALL and look up my vast accomplishments. My award winning roses still adorn the entrance way. I was able to parlay my Fencing fame into my current Asst. Managerial position in one of the finest men&#039;s clothing stores in all of London. I will also have you know that i give PRUNING SEMINARS in the English countryside on weekends. Goes to show you Yankee WAGS, hard work and perseverance (and picking up a book once in awhile) do indeed pay off then!<br><br>Richard Harcourt Weatherbee III<br>Oxford University - Champion Fencer &amp; Gardener<br>GPA 9.945.86","filename":"b","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":684,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1493167078332,"time":1493167078,"md5":"DmcvT8KVgXY37F+gk2O\/5g==","fsize":249827,"resto":122788830,"id":"MIf6\/V6F","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122815466,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)20:43:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"bump","time":1493167392,"resto":122788830,"id":"5K+X\/lZe","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122815513,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)20:43:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122791922\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122791922<\/a><br>I am in North Texas how fucked would electronics be?

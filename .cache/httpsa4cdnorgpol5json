Things started off okay. Students debated with me on why that wasn&#039;t okay. That&#039;s great! I&#039;m glad to have a debate. Hell, if someone wants to hold up a sign criticizing me, go for it. Anyway, here&#039;s the kicker... word got back to the teacher and now she&#039;s contacting the higher ups about it. I don&#039;t know what they&#039;re going to do, but it&#039;s worrying.<br><br>This whole situation doesn&#039;t even make sense. We have an extremely tiny free speech zone on campus, and because I didn&#039;t criticize the teacher in our laughably small free speech zone, I&#039;m breaking the rules. This is so stupid, so I can only criticize her if I&#039;m standing at a certain corner of the college? Why? Does my speech somehow become less offensive if I&#039;m standing in a different corner?<br><br> If you&#039;re willing to fight for free speech, and you want to criticize their attempts to silence it, feel free to contact them. I&#039;m not sure if I am legally allowed to provide their phone number or email addresses, though I&#039;m sure you can look it up if you just do a quick Google search.<br><br>Cypress College<br>9200 Valley View St<br>Cypress, CA 90630<br>United States<br><br>I&#039;m not responsible for anything you might tell them.","filename":"IMG_3905","ext":".png","w":1136,"h":640,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1492453711695,"time":1492453711,"md5":"1KCl1HuLzJAzAgHi36\/cMw==","fsize":721946,"resto":0,"id":"FJJJSjHA","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"im-making-this-thread-to-give-an-update-on-a","country_name":"United States","replies":23,"images":0,"omitted_posts":18,"omitted_images":0},{"no":121565562,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)15:09:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121565288\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121565288<\/a><br> Yeah, you kind of need to get an attorney to help you with that.","time":1492456168,"resto":121559885,"id":"FJJJSjHA","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121565898,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)15:12:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121565288\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121565288<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;taken down for a cartoon frog<\/span><br>lmao I&#039;m glad I graduated a long time ago because I wouldn&#039;t put up with this shit.

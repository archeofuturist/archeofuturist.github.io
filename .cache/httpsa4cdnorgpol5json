Sex is not very gratifying for the average non-deviant woman. To women, sex is mostly just a gift she gives to a man. Women are attracted to men the same way men are attracted to men: socially, not sexually. There are actually studies that show women find other women to be better looking than men. The orgasms some women can experience is really just a male orgasm. The clitoris is just a vestigial penis. The vulva is not related to the vagina at all. The actual vagina itself is nothing more than a birth canal. Embryos start off as &quot;sexually undifferentiated&quot;, meaning it has the parts necessary become male and female. The internal female parts degrade if a y chromosome is present to activate maleness, and the internal male parts degrade if maleness is simply never activated. The vulva is the embryo&#039;s penis\/phallus template. Men have useless nipples they will never use for similar reasons. The female orgasm is sort of like a pleasurable &quot;trick&quot; some women can get themselves to do. Just like men can make their nipples lactate with enough effort.<br><br>Women just were not shaped by evolution to enjoy sex. &quot;Female sexuality&quot; is a mostly new idea that feminist invented.","filename":"mOvZJ4s","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":768,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1490057447481,"time":1490057447,"md5":"F95cPomUZv7UZ69T9g7nbA==","fsize":76747,"resto":117554113,"id":"o1OakpCI","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117562284,"now":"03\/20\/17(Mon)20:55:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117561186\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117561186<\/a><br>I don&#039;t see why women can&#039;t be warped by early experience too.

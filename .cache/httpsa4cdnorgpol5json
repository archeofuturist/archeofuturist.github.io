My point is simply that the convenience of the situation for the establishment is not enough to say that they orchestrated it. These things happen because of enormous glaciers moving in the population, and any reactionary movement will start fringe and then explode, and then will spawn a resurgence of their polar opposite (see GL). It&#039;s the same as has happened many times over with the center collapsing, currently in other countries in europe but also throughout history (last time being the 30s probably). <br><br>Your example of them putting FvD behind the PVV is a good one though, and I believe that they do such things at least partially on purpose. But like I said in my previous comment, this is also a result of how some people view the world (good vs bad) and how the party is fringe for a reason. It&#039;s very easy to spot malice on a small scale (like specific anti-FvD bloggers) but these people are not orchestrating anything. It always happens that a reactionary movement grows as the discard pile of those people that the establishment refuses to acknowledge.","filename":"1463991629149","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":640,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490704593329,"time":1490704593,"md5":"kdOYl3238N7GDEwZejU\/yQ==","fsize":44242,"resto":118616298,"id":"OpsqCdVv","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":118644421,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)08:37:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"Jezus Christus, wie is die dikke walvis?","time":1490704670,"resto":118616298,"id":"ITZOMuSD","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":118644704,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)08:41:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118640914\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118640914<\/a><br><br>Mykeru&#039;s video&#039;s might be hard to understand if you weren&#039;t closely aware of the clusterfuck that was the &#039;infighting&#039; withint the atheist\/skeptic community 5\/6 years back.<br><br>Noelplum also makes well-thougt out video&#039;s, that go much deeper than your average run of the mill Sargon clone.","time":1490704888,"resto":118616298,"id":"w6qNsl7g","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118638625,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)07:17:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"Is manspreading real, \/pol\/?","filename":"image","ext":".jpg","w":2048,"h":1450,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":177,"tim":1490699868687,"time":1490699868,"md5":"FxbnBMmrHRLNgVtfFgWIdQ==","fsize":684074,"resto":0,"id":"h76ATTdI","country":"GB","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"is-manspreading-real-pol","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":16,"images":2,"omitted_posts":11,"omitted_images":2},{"no":118643545,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)08:25:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118642084\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118642084<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;manspreading is when a man spreads his physical body to take up as much space as possible<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;physical body<\/span><br>I only manspread with my astral body, am I doing it wrong?","filename":"healing crystals","ext":".jpg","w":1250,"h":831,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1490703909621,"time":1490703909,"md5":"BhFNArQ86ibKQDQS+tJnjg==","fsize":206997,"resto":118638625,"id":"bQxkq9mT","country":"NO","m_img":1,"country_name":"Norway"},{"no":118643560,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)08:25:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118638625\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118638625<\/a><br>My knees are always together and I sit legs crossed, sweetie.","time":1490703923,"resto":118638625,"id":"8wO1THSs","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118643890,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)08:30:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118638848\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118638848<\/a><br>Transphobic!","time":1490704218,"resto":118638625,"id":"u4AwueWN","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":118643921,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)08:30:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118638625\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118638625<\/a><br><br>fuck off","time":1490704247,"resto":118638625,"id":"sdqztlYo","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118644689,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)08:41:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118638625\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118638625<\/a><br>If drinking milk is now cow nip sucking than yes.

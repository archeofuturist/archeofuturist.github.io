In the middle ages the church believed, and rightly so, that Jews were spreading a dangerous heresy of denying the lord and savior jesus Christ. It was only recently that the catholic church even opened up to the idea that jews could possibly enter heaven as &quot;No one comes to the father except through me&quot;. Hitler himself was baptized catholic and it was not until Vatican two that any of these horrible heresies against Christ were ever believed by catholics. I myself am a roman catholic and a proud white nationalist. There is a need now, more than ever for white nationalists to join the catholic faith. Aside from the numerous religious reasons, it is only through the acceptance of an anti birth control ideology that the white race has any chance to grow again. But if we do join together as a race under one religion again we can not only reform the church but begin to reform society and bring back that golden age of white christain dominance that led to the wonders of the 19th and 20th centuries","time":1493492100,"resto":123357019,"id":"IclSz4Rv","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123366093,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)14:58:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123365676\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123365676<\/a><br>This guy knows what&#039;s up.","filename":"9389614298_9190b4c28f_k-1024x767","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":767,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1493492311952,"time":1493492311,"md5":"sG6pmY8gz2hMhofgymQpgA==","fsize":384321,"resto":123357019,"id":"5XkOsqK9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":123363780,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)14:38:14","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Brazilian strike international coverage","com":"Guys, I really need some infographics about who owns the international media.

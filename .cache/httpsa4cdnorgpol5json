Instead, it is intended for Iranian-supported groups and advisors on the ground in Syria to combat the SVBIED threat posed by the so-called Islamic State or the vast distances that forces are finding themselves engaging each other in the Syrian civil war. The reason why I say this is that there isn\u2019t an adoption notice of the rifle by the Iranian Ground Forces and the Iranians already have a number of more advanced anti-material options at their disposal. Such as the Shaher .50 Cal rifle or the 20mm Arash, or even the locally produced versions of the Steyer HS 50.<\/span><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=JM3<wbr>p2BLums8 <br>Bideo from the article.","filename":"n3441341-5774349","ext":".jpg","w":1200,"h":830,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":86,"tim":1492779429233,"time":1492779429,"md5":"ctBE0+AbTO4OtvbmusjgMw==","fsize":817646,"resto":122126885,"id":"Xe7ufSTY","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":122132071,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)08:50:22","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Zionists BBQ next to jailed Fakestinian child killers on hunger strike","com":"Why Americans are allowed to BBQ next to jailed Al Qaeda terrorist, but when Zionists do it it&#039;s evil?","filename":"C92ooF7XcAApUzQ","ext":".jpg","w":1200,"h":900,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1492779022479,"time":1492779022,"md5":"FCpRkfWblTcC\/Xf49hpr6Q==","fsize":302496,"resto":0,"id":"nST4c4mL","country":"IL","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"zionists-bbq-next-to-jailed-fakestinian-child","country_name":"Israel","replies":2,"images":1},{"no":122132390,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)08:54:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"We need to fire up germanys ovens again","time":1492779262,"resto":122132071,"id":"Nr9xNju8","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":122132630,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)08:57:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"You still are going to get gas shlomo","filename":"1492750015965","ext":".png","w":440,"h":720,"tn_w":76,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492779426369,"time":1492779426,"md5":"dnJ4gJzWGYjxibCQYqGTNA==","fsize":413654,"resto":122132071,"id":"z9MO1gOe","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]},{"posts":[{"no":122100147,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)01:14:26","name":"Anonymous","sub":"what will the next trans be?","com":"With the trans community exhausting all of their trans labels (Everything from gender, to animals, to objects) what will their next trans trend be?","filename":"what will the next trans be","ext":".png","w":1004,"h":1320,"tn_w":190,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492751666719,"time":1492751666,"md5":"8qkmzuVje7hTAjIVrwuzlQ==","fsize":534859,"resto":0,"id":"I8mTv+iW","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"what-will-the-next-trans-be","country_name":"United States","replies":182,"images":35,"omitted_posts":177,"omitted_images":35,"tail_size":50},{"no":122131287,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)08:40:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122100147\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122100147<\/a><br>Transmission<br><br>As in it is our mission to kill trannys","time":1492778433,"resto":122100147,"id":"DP\/HxlrB","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122131359,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)08:41:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122100147\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122100147<\/a><br>transautist","time":1492778487,"resto":122100147,"id":"PPT3tSas","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122132181,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)08:51:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122107614\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122107614<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;transplanar<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;identifies as a 2D loli.<\/span>","time":1492779099,"resto":122100147,"id":"+5EswZ\/k","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":122132480,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)08:55:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122111168\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122111168<\/a><br>Someone ought to post that mentally ill female who got her legs chopped because she felt she was handicaped at heart.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;female<\/span><br>Or was it a tranny, can&#039;t remember.","time":1492779318,"resto":122100147,"id":"+5EswZ\/k","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":122132628,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)08:57:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122102156\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122102156<\/a><br>The ultimate genderfluid","time":1492779423,"resto":122100147,"id":"hx5mnGMy","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":122132620,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)08:56:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"Is race actually more than skin color?

Now, my parents truly want me to question everything and never accept anything at face value, except the Holocaust, that&#039;s something they say shouldn&#039;t be doubted or questioned because then it trivialises the horror of it, and lessens the seriousness of it.<br><br>My dad was saying about growing up he was facisnated by it and did so much research and it all pointed to numbers around 15 million total deaths or both jews and minorities like gypsies and disabled and such. Apparently half of Autchwitz was destroyed before the war had ended in a bid to hide evidence. The little tour they take you through in the remnants of that place doesn&#039;t cover the true scale of it.<br><br>I just don&#039;t know what to believe, you know? It&#039;s annoying, in an age where information is so accessible that information on one of the greatest clusterfucks of mass genocide in history is so well hidden. Dad has said the numbers seem crazy, but there were 40k camps in Europe operating, from small camps of 100 to places like Autchwitz that killed upto 2000 people every few hours. I said 40k wasn&#039;t feasible, so he asked me how many would I think? I said it had to be much lower, lets be generous and say 3000 camps, the maths works out for 15mil at around 2000 odd people per camp, which doesn&#039;t seem unrealistic. Just 2000 people a day, across 365 days is over 2 million.<br><br>At the end of our convo, it did put things into perspective, but I&#039;m still not convinced.<br><br>Both mum and dad are saying I should watch &#039;A World at War&#039; which is a documentary series they watched growing up that looks at things objectively and not too biased, even against Nazi&#039;s.<br><br>Even so.

He met the boy through the make a wish foundation as he did with numeruos other sick children. He was told that the boy was terminally ill and that his dying wish was to meet him, so he moved him and his family into Neverland to help them. He paid Gavin&#039;s medical bills, brought his family a car, took them on shopping sprees, brought them gifts, ran blood drives at neverland, etc. The prosecution tried to argue that all these nice things were part of some pedophilic grooming process--No they weren&#039;t. They were part of the healing process of a terminally ill cancer survivor and to help his family who were very poor and couldn&#039;t afford much. Michael Jackson was one of the biggest humanitarians in the world. Once Gavin got better, Jackson felt that his work was done and had stopped paying attention to him. In fact, this was mentioned by Gavin himself. He testified on the witness stand that after he was done with his cancer, he didn&#039;t see MJ as much and felt that his best friend had abandoned him. He talked about how his number had changed and how he couldn&#039;t get a hold of him. He also mentioned an incident where he had visited Neverland and was told by MJ&#039;s bodyguards that he wasn&#039;t home, but later ran into him and MJ seemed surprised to see him. Gavin stated that this broke his heart because it meant that MJ had told his bodyguards to lie and say that he wasn&#039;t home, which meant that his friend didn&#039;t want to see him. So no, this kid was not one of MJ&#039;s &quot;special&quot; friends, nor was his family one of MJ&#039;s &quot;chosen&quot; families. It wasn&#039;t until AFTER the Bashir documentary aired, and all the negative chain of events starting happening that they all of a sudden came up with their allegations of kidnapping and sexual abuse. The jury saw right through their BS under cross examination where they each crumbled like cookies. They couldn&#039;t stop getting caught in their own lies.","time":1491815910,"resto":120400955,"id":"IHPkx1E+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120417745,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)05:22:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120411319\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120411319<\/a><br>Accusations, allegations, etc. <br>The shit he had was tame as fuck for porn and the art pieces were edgy at best.

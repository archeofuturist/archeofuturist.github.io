I have been whacking it to the same vanilla porn since the day I started. I will grant you that it does make you disinterested in real women, but I argue that regular masturbation does as well. No erectile disfunction, this is a meme or a sideeffect of literally jerking off ten times a day. Not depressed, not motivated either too much but periods of nofap have never had an effect on that, therefore it doesnt seem to be the cause. Not addicted whatsoever, can stop now and stay stopped for a month without even trying. No excessive whacking here either, nothing is stopping you from whacking twice a week for example. The rest of your arguments I cant really argue against.","time":1491759768,"resto":120285835,"id":"LPX8xUQ9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":120309165,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)13:40:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"T_D : Trump is so great, and our position is so sound we&#039;ll ban anyone who disagrees with us.<br><br>Aren&#039;t you tired of these flip flopping neoconservatives that follow a person rather than an ideology?","filename":"Screenshot_20170409-133851","ext":".png","w":1080,"h":1920,"tn_w":140,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491759639968,"time":1491759639,"md5":"6Ij244vXfV47DKgsBd81Kw==","fsize":233593,"resto":0,"id":"DpIrG63J","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"td-trump-is-so-great-and-our-position-is-so-sound","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":1},{"no":120309406,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)13:42:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;we voted for a man, not the principles behind him<\/span><br><br>reddit was a mistake","filename":"le patriot face","ext":".png","w":1571,"h":910,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":72,"tim":1491759755937,"time":1491759755,"md5":"QJ8qRRMyIpxqGJTEsZTxEQ==","fsize":254766,"resto":120309165,"id":"S6ypO6CE","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":120309678,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)13:44:48","name":"Powered by Russian Hackers","com":"CTR<br> ShareBlue<br> CREW<br> Sage and hide shill threads<br><br> a9438b6c-4905-458e-9544-5811511c64a<wbr>7","time":1491759888,"resto":120309165,"id":"K8MBaYJD","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"}]},{"posts":[{"no":120304564,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)13:02:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"How do we recover?","filename":"1x2sxfjdziqy","ext":".jpg","w":720,"h":720,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491757335311,"time":1491757335,"md5":"atLDUnYh5m30uDFUQwoIgA==","fsize":41969,"resto":0,"id":"Woeh2IZp","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"how-do-we-recover","country_name":"United States","replies":44,"images":20,"omitted_posts":39,"omitted_images":16},{"no":120308747,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)13:37:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120304564\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120304564<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;1 in 3 billion<\/span><br>Complete and utter bullshit, not even a literal retard would fall for that.","time":1491759421,"resto":120304564,"id":"+JRykOkS","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":120308801,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)13:37:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120306880\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120306880<\/a><br>I think a better statistic to consider is the number of terrorist attacks in a country compared to the size of that country&#039;s muslim population.

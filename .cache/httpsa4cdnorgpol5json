He was worshipped during ceremonies that involved human sacrifice, cannibalism and homosexual orgies. As the god of destruction, he became the god of the Egyptian military. In ancient Rome, he was worshipped as the god Saturn by the Roman military (often with baptism by blood). Thus we see that Satan (Set, Saturn, Molech etc.) was worshipped by Solomon and his wives as he grew old and senile. This involved heterosexual sex orgies (Ashteroth), homosexual sex orgies (Baal, Set, Satan, Molech), human sacrifice (Molech) and even cannibalism (Set, Molech). Our modern high-level military leadership appears to have the same values as the ancients.","filename":"seth5","ext":".jpg","w":638,"h":479,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1493043798085,"time":1493043798,"md5":"qYH0JQTRR2G74y2p8gFHUw==","fsize":98570,"resto":122589953,"id":"zVMZDNli","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122590878,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)10:24:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122590731\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122590731<\/a><br>That is the symbol of Saturn.<br><br>ALL GLORY TO SATURN!","filename":"molochhat","ext":".jpg","w":623,"h":443,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":88,"tim":1493043882929,"time":1493043882,"md5":"ssjCF3HgexCoMmk9S\/UXUw==","fsize":58514,"resto":122589953,"id":"zVMZDNli","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122591183,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)10:28:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122590750\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122590750<\/a><br>You know nothing.

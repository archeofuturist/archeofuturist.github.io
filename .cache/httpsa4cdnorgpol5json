I know how anti-caucasian people think.. the arguments they use, etc. The hot button issue everyone is talking about is Islam, so of course that is my primary focus. I&#039;ll be blunt, it has no place in the west. The only Muslims I have known have actually been nice people, but the ideology, the passive behavior towards radicalists, and the fact that their religion permits them to lie to persuade or kill infidels is evidence enough that their ideology is incompatible with western societies. We need to organize and tackle these matters. I&#039;m talking about some heavy shit that may include arms dealing. This sounds really LARPy but someone needs to do it. A long term goal is a caucasian ethno-state, though at the moment that is unrealistic. Genocide and ethnic cleansing are not at all apart of my agenda. I have many friends of different ethnicities and orientations that I love dearly, but I also long for the caucasian people to live unmolested by the foreign hordes.

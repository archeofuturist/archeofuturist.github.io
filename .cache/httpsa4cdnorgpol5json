Apparently Ben was connected to this filmmaker David Crowley, who&#039;d appeared on the Alex Jones show a few years ago, and had been making a documentary called &#039;Gray State&#039; about the US government&#039;s role in creating ISIS. He was found dead in his home along with his wife and 5yo daughter by gunshot wound in January - coincidentally the very same day Ben Swann released his Pizzagate piece. What&#039;s more, supposedly the pic attached was found in his home, yet the police were quick to rule it as a homicide\/suicide, saying David had gone crazy and killed his wife\/daughter before killing himself.

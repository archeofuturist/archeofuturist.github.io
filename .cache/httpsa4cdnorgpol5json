But as an olderfag I have to say that to some extent it&#039;s always been true. There have always been people like what <a href=\"#p118472899\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118472899<\/a> described. You just knew to fucking avoid the hell out of them. That is still good advice. Believe me, there are still decent people who want relationships. Go with your gut, always, and keep your eye open for one of the right ones; she may show up when you least expect it.","time":1490590523,"resto":118451757,"id":"LGYQzPXI","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118473762,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)00:56:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118469776\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118469776<\/a><br>Wh... wha...what type of girl has a dick?","filename":"IMG_2922","ext":".jpg","w":278,"h":300,"tn_w":115,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490590576607,"time":1490590576,"md5":"DzrBPvQpwSjjtHIHF2y6tQ==","fsize":31330,"resto":118451757,"id":"g6rAXOUh","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":118473783,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)00:56:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118464538\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118464538<\/a><br>That&#039;s depressing.<br>At least she&#039;s not fat.","time":1490590588,"resto":118451757,"id":"0iag8NmJ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118467182,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)23:50:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;\/pol\/ will defend this<\/span>","filename":"1487783189792","ext":".png","w":1080,"h":1199,"tn_w":225,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490586613582,"time":1490586613,"md5":"RQr9C+eBMa0229Z3TJbljQ==","fsize":882101,"resto":0,"id":"NxuhBxGQ","country":"BR","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"pol-will-defend-this","country_name":"Brazil","replies":37,"images":8,"omitted_posts":32,"omitted_images":6},{"no":118473514,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)00:53:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118471989\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118471989<\/a><br>Getting ionized sucks ass but it&#039;s hardly fatal at a long range.

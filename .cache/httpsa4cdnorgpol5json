Been moving freely through the whole city my whole life. It&#039;s true that we have some ghettos in the northern part of town where you risk to get mugged or beaten up if you look like a rich kid. It&#039;s true that police prefer to have backup when going there, it&#039;s true that sometimes ambulances or other emergency services prefer to have police backup when going there. It&#039;s utter bullshit that those are literal &quot;sharia-controlled&quot; zones where nobody else can go. If anything there are some streets &quot;controlled&quot; by drug dealers and mobsters, but guess what? Those get raided by cops all the time. Just like your ghettos, or similar ghettos everywhere else on this planet.<br><br>For a &quot;real&quot; no-go zone like the former Walled City of Kowloon - we don&#039;t have such places in Europe.

These combination toilet-bidets (washlet) with seat warmers, or attachable bidets are particularly popular in Japan and South Korea, found in approximately 60% of households.[citation needed] They are commonly found in hotels and even some public facilities.

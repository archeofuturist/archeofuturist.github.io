Previously, developing the tools and techniques to create quality art was the challenge. Now, to be an artist of high quality, all you need is devotion and time because all the techniques are clearly laid out for you. You can find step by step guides to reproducing the Mona Lisa with a quick google search.<br>What&#039;s worse is people such as Pollock going as far as to legitimise skill-less art. Any fuckwit who likes pretty shapes and colours can be an artist.","time":1492837598,"resto":122226934,"id":"6sf8sjLV","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":122239297,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)01:09:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122226934\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122226934<\/a><br>try being right wing and talented and be open about it<br><br>you will realize quickly that you learn to keep your mouth shut and lie to fit in<br><br>the redpill is,there are MANY right wing artists,they just keep quiet becuase of the backlash<br><br>if you want a career as an artist you gotta pretend to be a leftist,i suspect taylor swift is one hence why she aint chimed in on trump","time":1492837781,"resto":122226934,"id":"ZyXFinD6","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122239460,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)01:11:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"...Harold Fox","filename":"dmv","ext":".jpg","w":670,"h":500,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1492837877026,"time":1492837877,"md5":"rbKtzaDkLDSjJzvHkbTHoA==","fsize":180238,"resto":122226934,"id":"Ihf6PEEz","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":122238505,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)01:00:55","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Somali Pirates","com":"How does \/pol\/ feel about Somali pirates? <br><br>Ever wondered what it&#039;s like to literally be paid to kill niggers? <br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=tpN<wbr>pDM-enLw","filename":"dead pirates","ext":".png","w":1285,"h":722,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1492837255973,"time":1492837255,"md5":"ig1jYyIx2aC3MrYerjg5kg==","fsize":925165,"resto":0,"id":"W+hoLa+i","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"somali-pirates","country_name":"United States","replies":6,"images":3,"omitted_posts":1,"omitted_images":1},{"no":122238932,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)01:05:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"around black waters never relax","time":1492837552,"resto":122238505,"id":"vVryK0xv","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122239065,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)01:07:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"Here&#039;s some more with sniper action<br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=15y<wbr>mRh_M-UU","filename":"1453088033659","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":640,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492837651699,"time":1492837651,"md5":"s1Y5Ty850Fd8KIr4VPan6Q==","fsize":100619,"resto":122238505,"id":"W+hoLa+i","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122239179,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)01:08:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122238505\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122238505<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Shooting niggers on a big boat<\/span><br><br>Sign me up!","time":1492837717,"resto":122238505,"id":"+yIlzA0a","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122239454,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)01:11:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122238505\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122238505<\/a><br>Somalian pirates are just another case of MSM fake news.<br><br>What would you do if European ships dumped toxic waste of your coast and contaminated your fish supply?

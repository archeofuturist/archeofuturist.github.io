What they have in common is they use superheroes or popular characters like peppa or spongebob, they involve fighting, shitting, farting and killing, they have tens of millions of views and thousands of automatically generated comments and responses. I tried to dig deeper but couldn&#039;t really find anything substantial on this topic... this stuff is really worrying. I think they are trying to confuse childrens&#039; brains with this bullshit or something.. hope you could help me out here and share your thoughts or knowledge on this.<br><br>Examples:<br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=E0Y<wbr>-3lK1Ak8<br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=_81<wbr>JoYTeFnU&amp;t=327s<br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=pCA<wbr>FG-DIc6M","filename":"don&#039;t call us bossy merchant happy","ext":".gif","w":490,"h":534,"tn_w":229,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492814623350,"time":1492814623,"md5":"1IGcUNeBB0bciAstZm3n4g==","fsize":312283,"resto":0,"id":"FoxaB9YS","country":"DE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"jewtube-is-poisoning-childrens-brains","country_name":"Germany","replies":174,"images":18,"omitted_posts":169,"omitted_images":18,"tail_size":50},{"no":122220507,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)22:09:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122197149\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122197149<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Jew propaganda<\/span><br><br><br>The truth about immigration, by the numbers:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=LP<wbr>jzfGChGlE<\/span><br><br>Cultural Marxist Jews Admit Organizing White Genocide<br><br>The plan to eliminate the white race: <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=bO<wbr>gkGzMdieI <\/span><br><br>Cultural Marxism in action\u2026 Political Correctness, the tip of the blade:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=q6<wbr>c_dinY3fM<\/span><br><br>Cultural Marxism &amp; Social Justice Explained:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=xn<wbr>qIj8C2Aek<\/span><br><br>Why are we in Decline - Cultural Marxism:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Vg<wbr>gFao85vTs<\/span><br><br>also see<br><br>The facts about slavery in North America:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=b5<wbr>tci36bNjg <\/span><br><br>Cultural Marxist Jews fund media propaganda against whites on an enormous scale:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=-4<wbr>Ojbi6lXQI<\/span><br><br>Does this sound familiar at all?

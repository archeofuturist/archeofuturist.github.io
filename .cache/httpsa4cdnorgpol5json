Another senate bill authored by the same pair of ambitious religious freedom fighters would allow people employed in any of Texas&#039;s 65 licensed occupations to refuse service to people if those folks violate their SHRB.<br><br>So, for example, private medical providers wouldn&#039;t really have to help trans patients if they assert that being transgender violates their SHRB; barbers wouldn&#039;t have to cut gay people&#039;s hair if they didn&#039;t feel like it; plumbers could let toilets overflow and electricians could keep people in the dark if they happened to religiously disagree with the customer&#039;s sexual orientation. And the bill would prohibit the state from disciplining them for any of this.<br><br>Other bills allow wedding-industry businesses, such as cake makers and florists, to refuse service to LGBT couples (HB 2876 by Rep. Scott Sanford), allow &quot;conscientious refusal&quot; of healthcare services of any kind based moral beliefs (HB 2878 by Sanford) and allow child welfare service providers to refuse to take in LGBT kids (SB 892\u2014also by Senator Perry).<br><br>None of these bills has made significant headway in the Lege, at least not yet. The so-called bathroom bill, SB 6, has passed in the Senate, but its future is far less certain in the house. A House substitute, HB 2899, is less restrictive than SB 6 and does not include provisions about requiring school districts and cities to enforce bathroom bills based on biological sex, but prohibits jurisdictions from passing trans-inclusive bathroom policies. Which, to the LGBT community, is not much better.","filename":"protests","ext":".jpg","w":745,"h":559,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1493253652100,"time":1493253652,"md5":"WUe20+E8dSZEYIQROa47HQ==","fsize":124520,"resto":0,"id":"d1Sf++8t","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"texas-attempts-to-pass-a-dozen-antigay-religious","country_name":"United States","replies":3,"images":0},{"no":122966903,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)20:41:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122966755\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122966755<\/a><br>if we allow full religious freedom then this must pass<br>otherwise its b\/s discrimination against christians","time":1493253716,"resto":122966755,"id":"OUV\/Os8h","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122967117,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)20:43:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122966903\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122966903<\/a><br>Discrimination against Christians is prohibited by federal law.","time":1493253812,"resto":122966755,"id":"d1Sf++8t","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122967159,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)20:43:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122966903\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122966903<\/a><br>WE WUZ OPPRESSED N SHIET","time":1493253832,"resto":122966755,"id":"CzhcWPn+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":122962130,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)20:05:37","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Sagebook Loves &quot;Man&quot; Tits","com":"Pic-related: person posts pic of girls boobies and FB removes it because muh community standards.

Elected state&#039;s chief justice in 2000, he installed a granite monument depicting the Ten Commandments in the Heflin-Torbert Judicial Building in Montgomery. The move led to controversies and additional legal action. When U.S. District Judge Myron Thompson ordered the monument removed, Moore refused to obey. That led to charges against Moore and, eventually, his removal from the bench in 2003.<br><br>After two unsuccessful campaigns for governor, Moore won re-election as chief justice in 2012. In Jan. 2016, Moore circulated an order telling probate judges not to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. The order, largely ignored, flew in the face of the U.S. Supreme Court&#039;s 2015 ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges striking down state bans on same-sex marriage.<br><br>Following complaints, the Judicial Inquiry Commission filed charges against Moore last May, leading to his automatic suspension from the bench. Moore accused LGBT groups of conspiring to remove him, but his attorneys in court took a more moderate tone, arguing Moore&#039;s order was meant as guidance and did not change the status quo on same-sex marriage. The Court of the Judiciary disagreed, and suspended Moore for the remainder of his term in September.","filename":"RoyMoore","ext":".jpg","w":777,"h":437,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1493253720298,"time":1493253720,"md5":"QsKulnwGeLggzE0NiktNBQ==","fsize":41102,"resto":0,"id":"89Kle337","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"alabaman-former-supreme-court-chief-running-for","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0},{"no":122967135,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)20:43:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122966913\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122966913<\/a><br>Yes, 100%.

Of course they have degrees and of course these big name &quot;intellectuals&quot; are their anointed heroes. Naturally, these are the people they look up to. they do this because it makes them feel as if they fit in with the intellectuals themselves. it&#039;s the same reason they love Ted Talks. It&#039;s easy and they feel it gives them intellectual superiority (IE. they don&#039;t have to waste time on actually getting a degree, even the Soros-paid protesters can spend 15 minutes to watch one of those on the ride to the BLM protest, right?).","filename":"48976546849","ext":".png","w":1273,"h":1117,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":219,"tim":1493007980022,"time":1493007980,"md5":"Bp6B2rnbHjjOJr1Kct8JeA==","fsize":633444,"resto":0,"id":"eW+7nwls","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"arguments-understanding-the-psychology-of","country_name":"United States","replies":17,"images":4,"omitted_posts":12,"omitted_images":3},{"no":122546903,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)01:15:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122545361\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122545361<\/a><br>Most of the beliefs in his manifesto are actually pretty common, but he expresses them with incredible eloquence.","time":1493010916,"resto":122542054,"id":"991NlcT\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122548554,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)01:33:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"bump","filename":"1467447229208","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":315,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":65,"tim":1493012002709,"time":1493012002,"md5":"K1Bw+1UyFNkyoTa9Htl8cA==","fsize":25015,"resto":122542054,"id":"eW+7nwls","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122549108,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)01:39:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122542054\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122542054<\/a><br>https:\/\/www.google.ca\/amp\/reason.co<wbr>m\/blog\/2017\/03\/01\/moral-outrage-is-<wbr>self-serving\/amp<br>I like this article on moral outrage.

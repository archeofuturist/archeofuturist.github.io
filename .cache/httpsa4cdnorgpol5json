The San Francisco Bay Area... a very racially diverse area, but not necessarily the highest concentration of blacks in a greater area like houston or atlanta or the new orleans ghettos which are basically mini-africas seeting with crime. The history of civil rights causes and supporting racial diversity in this area has made it the unofficial headquarters of liberal marxist anti-racist group think. Babyboomers like my parents in the 60&#039;s have basically led this area to what sweden\/germany is turning in to now. <br><br>One of the most annoying things that gets to me about living in this kind of environment is that whatever the situation, if it is created by a rude negro, it can no way be blamed on the individual because we hold them to such a low standard.<br><br>I have seen belligerent negroes instigate violence over nothing and im sick of it. I&#039;ve ridden public transportation for years for work in northern california and for business in Southern California. And maybe 1% of the time aggressive altercations were started by people that were non blacks.

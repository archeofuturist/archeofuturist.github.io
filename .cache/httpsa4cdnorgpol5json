Nearly every Wensday and Sunday I attended 2 hour masses. Granted at the time it was mostly because my school forced me to. However now I feel that regular Christianity just isn&#039;t enough.

On the other I want my offspring to lead a life that I can consider morally sound. <br><br>Although I&#039;m not leaving this decision entirely up to you guys I at least want to hear what you guys have to say.

Over the last few months, however, we&#039;ve seen Congressman Schiff, James Comey, etc., who are suggesting there are such connections and that further investigation is necessary. These two premises could be reconciled if we assumed the IC only began investigating Trump after Jan 20, as that would explain why Clapper wouldn&#039;t be privy to any evidence of a Russian-connection. BUT, we now know that isn&#039;t true: the intelligence agencies &amp; Obama administration were investigating\/monitoring Trump for nearly a year (or more). [For reference, here is Clapper on March 5: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ycZ<wbr>j5-5KJwA]<br><br>The way I see it, 1 of 3 things must be the case, but none of them makes sense: <br><br>1. Clapper lied on Mar 5. Clapper actually had seen evidence of a Trump-Russia connection, but he lied by saying he had seen no evidence. If so, then why would he lie? Clapper would&#039;ve lied on Meet the Press, but also in the DNI&#039;s report to Congress.<br><br>2. Clapper was telling the truth on Mar 5 (i.e. the IC had seen no evidence of collusion before Jan 20) BUT, since that time, they HAVE FOUND some new piece of evidence. If so, how could that be? The objectionable conduct would&#039;ve occurred when Clapper was still in office (i.e. before the inauguration) during a time when the intelligence agencies were already monitoring Trump. Wouldn&#039;t this info have been available to Clapper?<br><br>3. Clapper was telling the truth on March 5 (i.e. the IC had seen no evidence of collusion before Jan 20) AND, since that time, they HAVE NOT FOUND any additional piece evidence. If so, then why would the Dems\/Media push a narrative so hard knowing that evidence of a connection, if it existed, should have surfaced by now? Why would Comey undertake this investigation with nothing to go on?","filename":"Clapper March 5","ext":".png","w":1224,"h":704,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":143,"tim":1491291830265,"time":1491291830,"md5":"KmCESRAYfodxs2zmc174bA==","fsize":724930,"resto":0,"id":"c8ACZ32h","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"this-doesnt-make-sense-james-clapper-back-on","country_name":"United States","replies":3,"images":1},{"no":119446276,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)03:53:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"It&#039;s 100% political posturing to cover their asses for spying.","time":1491292429,"resto":119445655,"id":"2q1whxE4","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119447067,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)04:06:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"None of it does","time":1491293165,"resto":119445655,"id":"+SnQAKER","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119447453,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)04:11:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119445655\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119445655<\/a>","filename":"p-internet","ext":".jpg","w":1000,"h":800,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":100,"tim":1491293477965,"time":1491293477,"md5":"2G5Dp+08Z1rVDLWdQy3Evw==","fsize":62302,"resto":119445655,"id":"Cn8RlrMH","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":119445829,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)03:46:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"Why do people bitch about the electoral college so much because it gives a slight edge to smaller states in the presidential election when the fucking Senate, the upper chamber of Congress that every single piece of legislature ever written has to pass through, gives every single state completely equal representation with no accounting for population size at all?<br><br>Sure, an Alaskan&#039;s vote is worth almost 3 times as much in the presidential election than a Californian&#039;s, but they have 50 TIMES as much representation in the Senate.","filename":"ummm_1237346i","ext":".jpg","w":620,"h":400,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":161,"tim":1491292007397,"time":1491292007,"md5":"gYSImVbR4znr8VVxSxjFag==","fsize":32104,"resto":0,"id":"wx3L0Jn8","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"why-do-people-bitch-about-the-electoral-college","country_name":"United States","replies":6,"images":1,"omitted_posts":1,"omitted_images":0},{"no":119446053,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)03:50:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119445829\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119445829<\/a><br><br>This cartoon literally summarizes the lead up to Election Night and the aftermath....","filename":"Election Night","ext":".jpg","w":960,"h":616,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":80,"tim":1491292227214,"time":1491292227,"md5":"UCCFj2IZmJXWNTBAazVKrg==","fsize":134446,"resto":119445829,"id":"bQE+e0Kp","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119446100,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)03:51:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119446053\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119446053<\/a><br><br>Shit art style tho","time":1491292262,"resto":119445829,"id":"BCybaotf","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119446700,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)04:00:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"If Trump and Hillary swapped they&#039;d be defending it 100%.","time":1491292851,"resto":119445829,"id":"BeiS\/Rra","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119447037,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)04:05:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119446700\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119446700<\/a><br><a href=\"#p119445914\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119445914<\/a><br><br>Missing the entire point of OP. <br><br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Conne<wbr>cticut_Compromise<br><br>Some dudes decided this would be a good idea because they were afraid of Virginia and Massachusetts.

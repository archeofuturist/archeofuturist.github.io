Especially compared to like Western Europeans. It&#039;s like the two opposite extremes.

Most of it was illegal.<br>In the Great War the British under General Allenby had come into possession of the Palestinian territories and established a Mandate that was ostensibly neutral, with the official intention of reaching a two-state solution. Jewish mass migration was reaching intolerable levels so the authorities attempted to curb them to no serious effect.<br>By 1948 the violence and civil unrest had reached a point where the UN plan to enact the two-state solution (in large part from the pressure of the British authorities, who were already seen as pro-Arab) caused the Zionist terrorist groups to break out into open revolt. The UN withdrew, &quot;Israel&quot; was formed, that&#039;s the end of it.","time":1492959595,"resto":122410233,"id":"7sFwpsRP","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122434314,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)11:08:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122411676\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122411676<\/a><br>He isn&#039;t wrong, however there was an Arab Higher Committee (that I believed was present at UN meetings) and an Arab League that was ostensibly supposed to represent Palestinians.<br>The more honest Israelis will just admit that might makes right, the less honest ones will lead you down contorted roads with pointless sophistry about what a &quot;nation&quot; is, etc.","time":1492960085,"resto":122410233,"id":"7sFwpsRP","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122434676,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)11:11:21","name":"syrian Christian","com":"Jews=cancer","time":1492960281,"resto":122410233,"id":"r8jBOybR","country":"US","trip":"!Ei57qO5Jsg","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122434682,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)11:11:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122432132\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122432132<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;im lovin it<\/span><br>mcdonalds shill","time":1492960285,"resto":122410233,"id":"YWjr3k0d","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122434782,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)11:12:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122410233\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122410233<\/a><br>French Jew named Herzl got butthurt over another jewish man being arrested as a spy, the Dreyfus affair, and decided Jews had to steal a country for themselves. <br>His zionist organization threw around a lot of suggestions of which country to steal but being an ethnoreligious group they decided they should steal what was then known as Palestine from the British. <br>They started moving there at the end of the 1890s but it wasn&#039;t until 1919 that the Jews in Britain had lobbyed hard enough to get some official support through the Balfour Declaration.

As long as they&#039;re a minority, I&#039;m prepared to welcome Asians (the good ones, Koreans, Japanese, etc.) into the White ethnostate. Their personality traits mostly check out - there&#039;s a bit of a lack of creativity and entrepreneurship, but they make up for it in pure productivity. They&#039;re hardworking, technically intelligent, and have light skin. Even more importantly, they have very white noses - at worst Grecian, at best English and snubby. The slanty eyes aren&#039;t ideal, but honestly they breed out in one or two generations. To boot, many of them are already Christians.<br><br>I think East Asians would make a solid ally for Whites and could play a great role in the coming war, and I definitely want them on our side.

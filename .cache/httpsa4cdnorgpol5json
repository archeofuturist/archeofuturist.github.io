If you knew me in real life, you would ridicule me to no end. I am much too liberal to fully be apart of your community, so I mostly lurk. However, I am very much interested in the protection of those with European descent. We as a people have been demonized and marked for death the past few years especially. It&#039;s only going to get worse unless action is taken. I am based in LA (yes go ahead and call me a fag) and am very immersed in the art scene. I know a lot of people. I know how anti-caucasian people think.. the arguments they use, etc. The hot button issue everyone is talking about is Islam, so of course that is my primary focus. I&#039;ll be blunt, it has no place in the west. The only Muslims I have known have actually been nice people, but the ideology, the passive behavior towards radicalists, and the fact that their religion permits them to lie to persuade or kill infidels is evidence enough that their ideology is incompatible with western societies. We need to organize and tackle these matters. I&#039;m talking about some heavy shit that may include arms dealing. This sounds really LARPy but someone needs to do it. A long term goal is a caucasian ethno-state, though at the moment that is unrealistic. Genocide and ethnic cleansing are not at all apart of my agenda. I have many friends of different ethnicities and orientations that I love dearly, but I also long for the caucasian people to live unmolested by the foreign hordes. I could see this thread getting deleted or meme&#039;d to death, but let&#039;s try and have a discussion anyways.","filename":"article-0-1975158400000578-382_634x802","ext":".jpg","w":634,"h":802,"tn_w":197,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491936328363,"time":1491936328,"md5":"5H2cWKW\/LqoASDb1gArD5w==","fsize":152852,"resto":0,"id":"J\/llRiZV","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"california-takes-action","country_name":"United States","replies":6,"images":2,"omitted_posts":1,"omitted_images":1},{"no":120636681,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)14:52:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"This is why we fight","filename":"1491918579013","ext":".jpg","w":460,"h":817,"tn_w":70,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491936720527,"time":1491936720,"md5":"bSDaKGr\/HJz8lC5hLADzzQ==","fsize":58381,"resto":120635760,"id":"J\/llRiZV","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120636921,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)14:53:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120635760\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120635760<\/a><br>bumpo","time":1491936818,"resto":120635760,"id":"bvMpaEH7","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120637223,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)14:55:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120635760\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120635760<\/a><br>bump","time":1491936944,"resto":120635760,"id":"tC3O933E","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120637506,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)14:57:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120635760\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120635760<\/a><br>k","time":1491937078,"resto":120635760,"id":"N6ICsF9N","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120637549,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)14:58:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120635760\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120635760<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I&#039;m not one of you, I am much too liberal<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I am very much interested in the protection of those with European descent<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Islam has no place in the west<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;their ideology is incompatible with western societies<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I&#039;m talking about some heavy shit that may include arms dealing.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;A long term goal is a caucasian ethno-state<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I also long for the caucasian people to live unmolested by the foreign hordes<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I am much too liberal<\/span><br>I don&#039;t know, that doesn&#039;t sound too liberal to me.","filename":"Magnus s\u00f6derman","ext":".jpg","w":512,"h":512,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491937099840,"time":1491937099,"md5":"p3p3lOfjo+ZCHQX81rQptg==","fsize":56060,"resto":120635760,"id":"fC9Q1\/2A","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"}]},{"posts":[{"no":120637492,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)14:57:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"CCA and the private prison industry is one of the most corrupt and unjust institutions in the developed world, and showcases the dark side of capitalism (not that I think there&#039;s a better economic system at the moment). <br><br>They are a conflict of interest in the pursuit of justice and should be outlawed.

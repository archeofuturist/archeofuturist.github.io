Somebody voices an opinion, usually saying they disagree with something our infallible saint of a president has done, and instantly a swarm of SJW idiots start responding calling them a &quot;troll&quot; or a &quot;shill.&quot; No counter-arguments, no attempts to disprove what they said or offer a differing opinion. Just &quot;YOU&#039;RE A SHILL.&quot; Name-calling people to avoid having to consider or respond to anything they actually said is a typical leftist tactic, except now we have &quot;troll\/shill&quot; instead of &quot;racist.&quot;<br><br>It&#039;s even worse over on Breitshart. Ever since they added the ability to block people in the comments section, all of the special snowflakes have taken to blocking anybody they see saying anything they disagree with. Go to any article about Trump and look at the comments section for yourself. Somebody so much as says they disagree with this particular thing Trump did and it&#039;s instantly &quot;fuck off troll. BLOCKED!&quot; The only things that it DOES seem to be ok to criticise Trump on are articles about him hiring women or non-whites to positions of power.

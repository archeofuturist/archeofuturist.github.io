Gotta do something I guess.<br><br>Not only do I get begged for my pills but the people who found out I take them told other people and now a bunch of people (some I don&#039;t even really know) basically harass me. I&#039;ve never given anyone a single pill and I never will, but holy fuck people want this shit more than anything else in their lives. More than anything.<br><br>Fucking bullshit degenerate pieces of shit ruin everything. <br><br>Know what&#039;s funny... everyone I know that uses opioids is either a liberal or someone with idiotic political views. People tell me all the time that we should just make opioids legal and let anyone buy them from pharmacies as much as they want without a prescription. <br><br>Kill everyone alive.","filename":"pepe on fire","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":500,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490837406448,"time":1490837406,"md5":"y2LgNZjOlIgLtXmHwvRbTA==","fsize":41244,"resto":118854977,"id":"Em015qar","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118864613,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)21:41:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118863375\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118863375<\/a><br>I know you&#039;re against medical marijuana","time":1490838096,"resto":118854977,"id":"+wBhSYAz","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118856133,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)20:22:41","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Why did Obama spend so much time golfing?","com":"Why didn&#039;t anyone care?","filename":"obama_vacation","ext":".jpg","w":2424,"h":1617,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1490833361304,"time":1490833361,"md5":"JPhFKyDFXAgDtQNAOM+vAg==","fsize":1255918,"resto":0,"id":"OBDq\/Ogd","country":"CA","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"why-did-obama-spend-so-much-time-golfing","country_name":"Canada","replies":46,"images":18,"omitted_posts":41,"omitted_images":16},{"no":118864504,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)21:40:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"Golf is such a shit &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;sport&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;","time":1490838034,"resto":118856133,"id":"wP43XuwF","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118864537,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)21:40:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118856133\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118856133<\/a><br>A niggers natural environment is in the field.

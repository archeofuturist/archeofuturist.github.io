Black children adopted by white parents average 89 on IQ tests at age 17 (slightly better than the 85 average for blacks nationally).

The aim of the study was to determine the contribution of environmental and genetic factors to the poor performance of black children on IQ tests as compared to white children. The studies\u2019 general findings were that the IQs of children of a particular race did not differ significantly depending on whether they were raised by their biological parents or by adoptive parents of a different race.

Let&#039;s make no mistakes here; people are not in fact equal. While it can be hard to stomach for a newfag or a normie, the truth is that evidence shows that different human races- be it white, black, asian, hispanic- are fundamentally different in ways aside from physical and cultural. Natural selection in different environments saw to that.<br><br>Undeniable proof comes in the example of social and technological development over history; even though they didn&#039;t really arrive at largely different times to each continent, Europeans in the 18th century were a sophisticated culture with high technology and social developments. The African culture of that time was still largely tribal, with very few developments compared to those of the Europeans, and at a much slower pace. One can bitch about isolation in this point, but it doesn&#039;t matter; just look at Japan and China, who were isolated from the West and still developed large, advanced cultures without European influence until recently in history. One has to look at these and wonder, &quot;could there be a reason?&quot; That&#039;s a simple answer: blacks are fundamentally inferior to whites and asians, and largely depended upon forcible integration into other cultures. Things like slavery in the American South integrated blacks into Western culture for practically the first time on a large scale. Had it not been for these racists, America today would lack a large black minority; the blacks would have received their Westernization in the form of late 19th century imperialism, which would have gone far worse.","filename":"dindu","ext":".jpg","w":780,"h":3524,"tn_w":55,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491778703106,"time":1491778703,"md5":"GCNzsrHYHj2\/x6ikKTgXnQ==","fsize":638578,"resto":0,"id":"PBBD6heS","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"itt-liberalnormie-arguments-and-rebuttals","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":120345592,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)18:09:27","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Ok hol up","com":"So after 2 years of unwavering support you decide that you hate trump because he blew up an empty building?","filename":"1491583378062","ext":".jpg","w":218,"h":605,"tn_w":90,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491775767395,"time":1491775767,"md5":"vCLKi9x\/FxmYhF\/xGQ0ocg==","fsize":32149,"resto":0,"id":"N7DuUlFD","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"ok-hol-up","country_name":"United States","replies":36,"images":6,"omitted_posts":31,"omitted_images":5},{"no":120351629,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)18:53:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120345592\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120345592<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;So after 2 years of unwavering support<\/span><br><br>I voted Hillary suckaaaaz","filename":"came in building","ext":".png","w":423,"h":317,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":93,"tim":1491778420102,"time":1491778420,"md5":"GbgJPYCiCysYHHCDPWUeQQ==","fsize":220468,"resto":120345592,"id":"MkiAWLTn","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120351944,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)18:56:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120351627\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120351627<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I&#039;ll take &quot;Things That Never Happened&quot; for $200, Alex.<\/span>","time":1491778561,"resto":120345592,"id":"y8aUYg5r","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120352169,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)18:57:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120351535\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120351535<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;against ISIS<\/span>","time":1491778657,"resto":120345592,"id":"N7DuUlFD","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120352247,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)18:58:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120352169\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120352169<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;false pretext<\/span>","time":1491778693,"resto":120345592,"id":"y8aUYg5r","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120352271,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)18:58:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120351627\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120351627<\/a><br>wait, did you shoot him in the back or the mudhole?","filename":"cute or smart","ext":".jpg","w":507,"h":518,"tn_w":122,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491778702688,"time":1491778702,"md5":"g6F9Ia2NM9ctQOG6WJ\/eoQ==","fsize":48534,"resto":120345592,"id":"MkiAWLTn","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":120313536,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)14:15:34","name":"Anonymous","sub":"\/pol\/ communism general","com":"Hello Comrades. This general is for the discussion of Marxism-Leninism, the ideology of revolutionary socialism and communism.<br><br>Communism is the next stage of humanity following the capitalist stage.<br><br>What exactly is communism according to Marxist-Leninists:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Communism is a stage of society in which the productive infrastructure is socially owned, and goods are produced not in order to sell for profit, but in order to meet a social need.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Communism in it&#039;s full form is a stateless, classless society that follows the maxim &quot;From each according to their ability, to each according to their need.&quot;<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;To achieve such a society Marxism-Leninism teaches us that we must replace the capitalist state, which is controlled by the capitalist class, by a socialist state, which is controlled by the working class. Then, a period of class struggle follows in which the capitalist class is liquidated by the working class. When the capitalist class has been completely vanquished, there will be only one class, the working class, and eventually the functions of the state will become indistinguishable from the functions of the society as a whole, and the state as such will &#039;wither away&#039; as Marx said.<\/span><br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/ma<wbr>rx\/works\/1847\/11\/prin-com.htm<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/ma<wbr>rx\/works\/1848\/communist-manifesto\/<br><br>ML uses a philosophy called dialectical materialism, see here:<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/reference\/<wbr>archive\/stalin\/works\/1938\/09.htm<br><br>It is recommended that you read some of the critical works of Marxism-Leninism so you can make an informed assessment of the ideology.<br><br>Resources:<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/ma<wbr>rx\/works\/sw\/<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/le<wbr>nin\/works\/sw\/<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/reference\/<wbr>archive\/stalin\/works\/decades-index.<wbr>htm<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/reference\/<wbr>archive\/mao\/selected-works\/<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/ma<wbr>rx\/works\/1884\/origin-family\/<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/le<wbr>nin\/works\/1914\/mar\/11.htm","filename":"1481244074852","ext":".png","w":1010,"h":1010,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491761734122,"time":1491761734,"md5":"676S1nirnOI5InkeibSxFw==","fsize":177742,"resto":0,"id":"Un\/xTy4J","country":"ES","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"pol-communism-general","country_name":"Spain","replies":194,"images":65,"omitted_posts":189,"omitted_images":61,"tail_size":50},{"no":120351259,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)18:51:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120350667\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120350667<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;but you will have the honor to pay up when their business project won&#039;t be fruitful.<\/span><br>You really have no idea how the real world works do you?<br>In construction, the contractors AND the customer are required to take out bonds the project, like an insurance policy. The contractor pays his premiums and if he ever default on the contract the bond company pay to the customer the contractors bond. This allows the customer to hire another contractor. At the same time, the customer is required to purchase a bond as well. If the customer doens&#039;t pay the contractor, the bond company pays the contractor for work done. <br>In either case, the bond company would sue the customer\/contractor for breach of contract on the bond.

If their was parity between population size and the ratio of mixed couples stayed the same we would have a huge percentage of mixed race couples. Right now, 3% of the 60% white crowd is married to part of the 13% groid crowd. That is a massive number when taken in context, and only relates to married couples, the majority of interracial couples are not married... You must remember that most of white America does not live around nigs, this is why the number still seems small. I unfortunately do, and I can say their is a very large percentage of mixed race couples in my area, I&#039;d say 1 in 5 minimum. <br><br>Also, it&#039;s not about race, at least with me. Its about the fact that nigs and nig culture is garbage. Nigs in the US have a 90% abandonment rate after having a child with a white woman, and 78% abandonment rate with PoC races. That is abhorrent, the niggers will leave a whole generation of children screwed. Keep in mind, the best indicator for future success of a child, wealth, health, mental well being, etc etc, is being raised in a home with both of their biological parents. Their is no better indicator of future success than that, and yet all these children are being denied that chance at a decent future because of selfish low agency niggers. Add to that the burden put onto taxpayers and the welfare state caused by all of these single moms raising children without a father or child support and you can see that race mixing is the fast track to a destroyed nation.","time":1490263697,"resto":117906210,"id":"TlvCvf10","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117916319,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)06:24:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"obvious MK Ultra agent....<br><br>\/pol\/ hero<br><br><br>\/pol\/ sucks the fed cock","time":1490264665,"resto":117906210,"id":"LOt8Agcz","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":117913776,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)05:50:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"Why is \/pol\/ so hypocritical?","filename":"Defend this pol","ext":".png","w":669,"h":492,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":183,"tim":1490262609720,"time":1490262609,"md5":"UOSbKZz6jn\/Kz4z11KDelg==","fsize":311994,"resto":0,"id":"rG5v\/0E7","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"why-is-pol-so-hypocritical","country_name":"United States","replies":22,"images":3,"omitted_posts":17,"omitted_images":3},{"no":117916205,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)06:22:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117913776\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117913776<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Why is \/pol\/ so hypocritical?<\/span><br>what are you babbling about.....<br>comedy comes in the form of context. <br>bathroom jokes were funny when i was 12yrs old, but not anymore. fuck that stupid cunt.","time":1490264574,"resto":117913776,"id":"YB1ZatQn","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117916218,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)06:23:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"The left is cute and humorous, the right is 3DPD and unfunny.

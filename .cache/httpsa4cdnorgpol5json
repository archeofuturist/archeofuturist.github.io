She isn&#039;t the type of person who seems duplicitous or conniving. Politically, she&#039;s very blue pilled and strongly supported Hillary. CIA recruitment, at least for analyst positions, appears designed to only get very straight laced people. For example, people who partied in college are disqualified because lie detector tests are used to weed out anyone who has used drugs.<br><br>The best comparison I can think of is that the CIA mostly recruits hall monitors. At least for the people doing the brunt of the intelligence work, their goal is to get bright, but submissive people.

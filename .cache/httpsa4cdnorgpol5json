This is largely based on the fact that the extension of European empires and trading companies in the post-Columbus period created global-level changes (in consumption of foods and goods, disease environments, cultural practices, etc.). But historians like Sanjay Subrahmanyam at UCLA have also argued that advanced polities like those of South Asia can be regarded as &quot;early modern&quot; in the sense that they underwent political, economic and technological developments that were comprable to those of Western Europe in the same period. I&#039;d point to Giancarlo Casale&#039;s The Ottoman Age of Exploration for more on this, and several of Subrahmanyam&#039;s articles, such as &quot;Connected Histories: Notes towards a Reconfiguration of Early Modern Eurasia.&quot; Its true that historians don&#039;t talk about &quot;early modern Fiji,&quot; but they in fact do talk about &quot;early modern Japan&quot; or &quot;early modern India,&quot; as a quick Google search will demonstrate.","filename":"l235","ext":".jpg","w":1239,"h":929,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1493198225004,"time":1493198225,"md5":"QLn3BvTb1ljWkKR8UY\/XFQ==","fsize":284956,"resto":0,"id":"PNNMgtvY","country":"CA","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"im-in-training-as-an-historian-of-the-17th18th","country_name":"Canada","replies":2,"images":0},{"no":122865055,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)05:21:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122864790\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122864790<\/a><br>Don&#039;t confuse \/pol\/ with facts.","time":1493198472,"resto":122864790,"id":"+rmuzUEo","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122865343,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)05:25:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122864790\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122864790<\/a><br><br>And your point is ?","time":1493198749,"resto":122864790,"id":"veJrXhA9","country":"RO","country_name":"Romania"}]},{"posts":[{"no":122863894,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)05:02:35","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Holy shit","com":"The guy that got cracked over the head with a bike lock by Eric Clanton at the Berkeley riots denies this fat guy a high five in his video<br><br>Guy getting hit with bike lock:<br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=9qK<wbr>Cl9NL1Cg<br><br>Guy denying fatty a high five at 2:42<br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/7u3uhKxNPNg?t=2m42<wbr>s","filename":"pepsichallengeguy","ext":".jpg","w":1279,"h":882,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":172,"tim":1493197355731,"time":1493197355,"md5":"w31HlP75c\/iipfPC8rFz+g==","fsize":264118,"resto":0,"id":"rMxNSeTw","country":"CA","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"holy-shit","country_name":"Canada","replies":13,"images":5,"omitted_posts":8,"omitted_images":4},{"no":122864435,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)05:11:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122864348\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122864348<\/a><br>thought so.","time":1493197900,"resto":122863894,"id":"fgnE84Gb","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122864488,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)05:12:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122864435\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122864435<\/a><br>Why would a shill name the bike lock guy (Eric Clanton) by name?

Women need to keep a lid on it and understand their limits. Both in terms of their looks and in terms of how their bodies work. They need to understand they will age in their 20s and their bodies will become unresponsive to male contact if they slut to much. <br><br>In terms of girls being able to pull men (and by pull I mean keep around) I see every girl around me severely limited. Honestly every girl between a 5 and an 8 just has to end up with a normal guy. There is no other way. Some play it a little better than other but that&#039;s it.<br><br>Yet every single time I meet a girl she&#039;s fucking playing around as if she has tons of options. This gets really frustrating when you know that you are just looking to fuck her and she&#039;s thinking of herself as some &#039;player&#039; who still needs to weigh her options. <br><br>Bitch please, she has no options. Most guys talking to her are guys that want to fuck. Even the betas are generally just clueless horndogs. This wastes allot of energy and it&#039;s why our society is so inefficient. <br><br>Because we have to deal with a mating ritual more complex than the inner workings of the universe. Man rarely has time to get good at one thing and yet now he hast to deal with this shit. It&#039;s all so tiresome. Dating should be simpler than this. The online chatting shit makes it even more annoying. I swear I hate talking to girls on my WhatsApp because all they do is waste time. I just reply every couple or dozen so hours and lose interest because they are contributing absolutely nothing to the table.","filename":"478244828","ext":".jpg","w":509,"h":339,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1490572094238,"time":1490572094,"md5":"3aF\/Lvt5e4QbNcCPEFf0FQ==","fsize":63134,"resto":118392126,"id":"sw5d0QNU","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":118440774,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)20:04:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118436056\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118436056<\/a><br>bet she got liver cancer from watching that dude dance","time":1490573064,"resto":118392126,"id":"t7ecRFmx","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118441942,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)20:12:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118392126\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118392126<\/a><br>There is not a single perfect body in that pic.<br>Top is too thin, bottom is too thicc.","time":1490573552,"resto":118392126,"id":"lHWW9vab","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118436664,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)19:35:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;itt we pretend its the days leading up to the invasion of Poland <\/span><br><br>GUYS WE HAVE TO FOLLOW BRITIAN INTO WAR WITH GERMANY, REMEMBER WW1 REMEMBER WW1 REMEMBER WW1 IF HITLER WAS ACTUALLY BASED HE WOULD JUST LEAVE COMMIES IN THE EAST ALONE COMMIES WILL MAKE THE WORLD GOOD","filename":"axis and allies","ext":".png","w":1480,"h":625,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":105,"tim":1490571302817,"time":1490571302,"md5":"GYuKuDtIuIkzFlTJ5WbE2w==","fsize":73175,"resto":0,"id":"XkEEWHQL","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"itt-we-pretend-its-the-days-leading-up-to-the","country_name":"Canada","replies":4,"images":0},{"no":118437874,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)19:43:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;WE HAVE TO FOLLOW BRITIAN INTO WAR WITH GERMANY<\/span><br>Oh no, I&#039;m not falling for this again.

Previously, Western Civilization enforced monogamy through various legal, religious and social pressures. As these restrictions have been removed, we are regressing back to the jungle in which women have multiple sexual partners with a small subset of the male population. In primitive societies this results in the harem. In such an arrangement the top 20% of the males sexually monopolize 80% of the females. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; We have seen such behavior for years in the inner city in which women have multiple \u201cbaby daddies\u201d. If you should visit a city such as Detroit, you will have a hard time finding a woman who has multiple children from the same father. What is interesting about these arrangements is that the biological fathers tend to be a small subset of the male population within the city. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;We find that 80% of these women share the 20% of the men in an unofficial polygamous arrangement. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; The problem with such a polygamous arrangement is that 80% of the men are left out of the sexual marketplace.

No aspie with underdeveloped social skills posting here is an autist, and in a culture or timeframe where forced virtue-signaling extraversion and group cohesion is not the social norm no one would pay much attention to deviations. (Which may actually be an unexpected side effect of mixed gender schools and workplaces, as girl and boy group dynamics are very different and incompatible.)<br> If you had not realised it by now, women&#039;s minds are so malleable by their social environment and conflict-avoidant nature that they usually internalise any consistent positions and values that the important people around them hold, given a modicum of time. This is evident in how they eagerly accept and follow rules from a position of social authorityand viciously attack any challenge to said rules coming from a position of lower social authority. Furthermore, the most important people in their lives are the man they love and their children. They also have an imperative to shit-test and challenge said man, trying to test if he can be trusted to not harm them, either intentionally or unintentionally by giving in to the constant uncertainty that plagues them.<br> If you have demonstrated that you can take care of yourself and her, that you can be trusted to keep your cool through all her hissyfits and other bullshit a woman will naturally adopt your values and authority. This has a great impact on their stress levels and resilience, to the point where over time &quot;disorders&quot; disappear. Unfortunately, today&#039;s society has only made this worse, by forcing women into big social groups with many different and sometimes conflicting points of authority (bosses, social circles etc), and it is a hard and thankless task.","time":1491344983,"resto":119470578,"id":"nmcRyVE8","country":"BG","country_name":"Bulgaria"},{"no":119527264,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)18:34:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119470678\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119470678<\/a><br>holy bantz","filename":"laughing harder","ext":".jpg","w":528,"h":805,"tn_w":81,"tn_h":124,"tim":1491345245270,"time":1491345245,"md5":"HhbT+R+QVKUy7B5rE9UCog==","fsize":124126,"resto":119470578,"id":"quw8+u48","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119527429,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)18:35:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119525777\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119525777<\/a><br>Trips says yea probably but probably shouldn&#039;t have outright said &quot;too many red flags&quot; next time just cancel without explanation","time":1491345329,"resto":119470578,"id":"RVIRLXsh","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119528274,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)18:42:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119475927\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119475927<\/a><br>The more women there are in the workforce, the more people are paying taxes, so the lower the taxes have to be.<br><br>As counterintuitive as it is, ever rising debt is totally sustainable.","time":1491345752,"resto":119470578,"id":"jy+fQA2P","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"}]},{"posts":[{"no":119527998,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)18:40:13","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Why does \/pol\/ vote for the corporate cock sucking party ?","filename":"IMG_4345","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":640,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491345613225,"time":1491345613,"md5":"HoiuCBTujeaHrSxLmnj0lg==","fsize":144588,"resto":0,"id":"9gzDFuos","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"why-does-pol-vote-for-the-corporate-cock-sucking","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":0},{"no":119528270,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)18:42:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119527998\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119527998<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;we can&#039;t<\/span><br>The Republicans don&#039;t get to decide if Trump releases his tax returns.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;but here&#039;s<\/span><br>The Republicans aren&#039;t giving anyone anything.

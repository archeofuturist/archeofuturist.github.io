She had only known Heinrich&#039;s baton on her back-side, but now she wanted to suck it while Hitler furiously fucked her asshole. Himmler, slowly pulling his baton out, teased Anne&#039;s willing pink lips with the end. Hitler then forced her head down on Heinrich&#039;s baton while jamming three fingers in her little Jewish pussy.

And I would agree with you that if the Church tries to control people directly that is a bad thing to do.<br><br>In fact I think that the importance of Christianity in particular is that it gives a basis for individual people to chose to do good and moral things themselves. If you look at the New Testament, Jesus does not force or compel anyone to do anything. He does say what is good and what is bad, and how one can obtain salvation, but it is always up to the individual to chose act that way. This is important for any sort of free society to exist. People must chose to do the right thing not because they fear some sort punishment, or government sanction but because it is simply the right thing to do. Now it is possible a society could exist where government exists to compel everyone to do the right thing but that would be a police state.<br><br>And how do you suppose this Godless society would arrive at deciding what is the &#039;right&#039; thing? Maybe at first it would start with people genuinely trying to formulate what they feel is best, but eventually, especially if this is a police state, it would be those in power who decide on what is right and what is wrong. And I am certain it would lead to those in power creating rules that benefit them and their cronies. Look at every socialist\/communist regime ever for proof. The masses are just cogs in the machine to benefit the elite.","time":1493444157,"resto":123285783,"id":"Pjo4LRhN","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123301379,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)01:42:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"Christians have proven to be the worst religious.

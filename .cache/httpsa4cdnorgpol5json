Guys i see lots of shitposting around here about my country and i wanted to tell you all news about it. First of all there are only one agency that have right to watch votes and publish it -which is belonged to goverment-. Turkey has at least 80 millions of population and 50 millions of voter. Yet acording to that agency it was over in 2 hours. When this agency said that it is over, it was actually %69 over and CHP(other political party) object to %60 of them. There should be a seal on the voting paper&#039;s back. Yet there are nearly 2.5 millions of voting papers that have no seal. There are no other time that this papers are accepted and it is totally illegal, there are no way that you can accept that. Goverment published that they will be counted as well. This is what happens in the capitals. What about towns? Well they are just voting themself, i can post tens of videos that they are voting yes on tens of papers. Even in all these situations the results are 51vs49. Which means that at least %60 of Turkey really doesnt want that. Also there are lots of people who votes yes are not even wanting that, they are forced to do that bc of their jobs or threats. They have all the media, even the internet. Acording to politicians Akp has 7000 internet trolls that is working with money. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Akp won, kurds btfo, nationalists won<\/span><br>No, these vids that i have been talking about: they guys whose are voting yes by illegally are speaking kurdish.

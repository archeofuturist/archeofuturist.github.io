One point of interest. I live in the Southern U.S. in a small town in northwest Alabama. There&#039;s a fairly large college here. For whatever reason, we seem to get waves of foreign students. I guess the college goes recruiting. Anyway, in the early 2000&#039;s a fuckton of Asians showed up. Mostly Japanese, but some Chinese and Koreans. The first year the majority of them were here, telling the girls apart from the boys took some observation. Partly because they all dressed alike, and partly because they were androgynous. The guys didn&#039;t look very masculine and the girls weren&#039;t particularly feminine. I mean, you could tell if you looked, but it wasn&#039;t obvious. That changed a year later. Most of these kids stayed in the dorms for the summer. And after a lifetime of eating rice, veggies and some occasional meat, they were dumped into a country where you can afford to eat beef for every meal if you want to. A few got fat, but mostly, the guys bulked up and the girls got curvy. It was a huge contrast when the next wave of Asian freshmen showed up the next year. The kids who had stayed here a year looked like Americans compared to the new arrivals.","time":1491959351,"resto":120686970,"id":"dAdj9J6X","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120690031,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)21:11:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120689201\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120689201<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;mfw swole manlet<\/span><br>I&#039;m not tall so I might as well be strong anon","filename":"aidskid","ext":".jpg","w":462,"h":353,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":95,"tim":1491959461448,"time":1491959461,"md5":"yJG1AZQT3Zv3H7xsT8IJpQ==","fsize":21191,"resto":120686970,"id":"Dx0GPxud","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120690035,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)21:11:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120688689\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120688689<\/a><br>Diet absolutely has an effect, see<a href=\"#p120689830\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120689830<\/a>","time":1491959463,"resto":120686970,"id":"dAdj9J6X","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120690133,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)21:11:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120686970\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120686970<\/a><br><br>lifting doesn&#039;t fix their face for most of them. that guy just looks freakish","time":1491959512,"resto":120686970,"id":"IWLd0qeg","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120690252,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)21:12:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120686970\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120686970<\/a><br>I will say Ive never seen such a hairy asian..<br><br>Is her part armo or something?","time":1491959567,"resto":120686970,"id":"hIbOm6r+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}]}

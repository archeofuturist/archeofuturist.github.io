Britain and America are best buds and have been for ~150 years, we will literally never fight against each other and will always come to others aid even if they don&#039;t deserve it, we&#039;re family. That being the case russia is backed into a corner, they are the third most powerful navy on earth, but first and second are aligned solidly against them. During the cold war the USSR did keep pace, the red fleet was huge and powerful, See image <a href=\"#p121641076\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121641076<\/a> but modern russia can&#039;t afford that, it was largely the building and maintaining of that fleet that caused the USSR to collapse from economic stress, they spent more than they had for so long they literally ran out of money. <br><br>So that being the case as long as the American navy exists the British have really no naval competition, they outclass russia and they REALLY COMPLETELY outclass everyone else, they have all the naval advantage they need and they don&#039;t need to spend money to get more, so they can afford to spend less money on a less powerful carrier design, because everyone they intend to bully with those carriers don&#039;t really even have a navy at all to contest the matter.

Let me see here. This concept that you brought up about &quot;drug licences&quot; makes the case that someone who is mature enough to understand the effects of drug usage would be able to purchase drugs. Fair point. But what I had said was that actions like this do not stop people from using it on children or other people, despite the potential effects of said drugs being known for decades.<br><br>There was a story of a mom who fed her 5-year-old son cocaine for no specified reason.

Would they have to go down to the nitty-gritty or would it be simple? Would they have to study? Would they have the time to study if they have jobs to go to and money to obtain? Wouldn&#039;t it end up resulting in a school situation in which they take the test once but in the end but later on forget or even not know what they put on a test?<br><br>This entire system makes the assumption that the public are trusted to make sane decisions. This, in a way, is also still decriminalizing because you&#039;re requiring hospitals for permission to have access to certain drugs for usage, especially when you need to ask doctors or clinics for the best drugs that were illegal before in order to alleviate yourself of whatever pain or sickness or whatever that you have.<br><br>Also, that &quot;infringing on your rights&quot; principle was not directed at the system itself, but rather what OP said when he said that we should eliminate societal bias against drugs. That bias will not be forgotten. It will still exist. As I said, there will be an existence of the pros and cons when it comes to drugs. That itself is an infringement on personal rights because you&#039;re trying to keep people who want to believe that drugs are bad from believing that drugs are bad, regardless.","time":1492493569,"resto":121621270,"id":"DVLPIGih","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121644957,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)01:36:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121621270\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121621270<\/a><br>I miss hot lindsay lohan","time":1492493777,"resto":121621270,"id":"MICVMdZl","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121645616,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)01:42:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"DAILY REMINDER THAT THE US GOVERNMENT HAS HELD A MEDICAL MARIJUANA PATENT SINCE 1999<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;tfw it&#039;s still a schedule 1 narcotic with NO medical use according to federal law<\/span><br>If you&#039;ll believe what they tell you without questioning it, then what else do you know that&#039;s wrong?","filename":"patent6630507","ext":".png","w":1005,"h":692,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":86,"tim":1492494161326,"time":1492494161,"md5":"e09EY5oIV4gcH2kqYvfdew==","fsize":56678,"resto":121621270,"id":"H91m+vFe","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121645625,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)01:42:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121643349\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121643349<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Heroin dealer here<\/span>","time":1492494169,"resto":121621270,"id":"9B+LfVIZ","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"}]},{"posts":[{"no":121602823,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)19:39:20","name":"Anonymous","sub":"GAME ON POL","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;https:\/\/medium.com\/@nicholas.w.mci<wbr>ntosh\/subverting-the-alt-right-7d70<wbr>3a843807<\/span><br><br>See this \/pol\/ and alt-right cucks, we understand you.

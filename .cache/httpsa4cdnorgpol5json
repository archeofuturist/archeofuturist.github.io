The US would bomb the fuck out of them, and use all missile defence systems in the area to shoot down everything the NKs put up. South Korea, with the help of several thousand US marines would hold or just cross the 38th. They would not go very deep into NK territory, and take up defensive positions after blowing the fuck out of any Howitzers or munitions that could hit Seoul. The Japanese will take defensive precautions and allow US missions to be flown from there, but mostly stay the fuck out of it. <br><br>Here&#039;s where it gets interesting. To appease the Chinese, America and its allies in the region would allow China (this has probably been agreed upon already) to invade from the North. Chinese troops have already massed in great numbers along the northern border. They would then push to the 38th parallel crushing all resistance with both Chinese and US air support backing them up. After completely destroying NKs armies, they will stop at the 38th. A demilitarized zone would then be established. China will then have a great big new province, which will justify their actions to the Chinese people. They will also gain a lot of landmass. This will make the Chinese very happy. South Korea will then become just Korea. The Chinese with the help of the Americans will rebuild the newly formed Chinese territory and both economies will go fucking gangbusters with rebuilding projects. This will end up being a major bridge between the US and China that will lead to years of peace and prosperity, as well as reducing tensions. China will be very happy to get this much landmass, they&#039;ll forget about building dinky little islands for quite some time.<br><br>One more thing. The North Korean people, will have a much better standard of living being under China. Many others will be allowed to immigrate to the newly minted Korea.<br><br>Make your move Kim... please.","filename":"Flag_of_North_Korea","ext":".png","w":1200,"h":600,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493357166988,"time":1493357166,"md5":"gg2+Nj4+7hogspAY7Own6g==","fsize":15077,"resto":0,"id":"e3v88CWZ","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"just","country_name":"Canada","replies":90,"images":9,"omitted_posts":85,"omitted_images":7},{"no":123164221,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)03:21:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"Will N.Korea be able to end kpop and Samsung?","time":1493364084,"resto":123152973,"id":"j\/8Z+Nzc","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123164405,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)03:23:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123157132\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123157132<\/a><br>Public execution","time":1493364229,"resto":123152973,"id":"FzhM2XGh","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123164427,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)03:23:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123163601\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123163601<\/a><br>but again, those artillery are strategically hidden deep within mountain valleys. you couldn&#039;t target them with missiles from afar that drop from an angle. and bombing runs from planes don&#039;t have the precision necessary to be effective","time":1493364238,"resto":123152973,"id":"TsCDESBS","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123164576,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)03:25:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123164111\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123164111<\/a><br>and do you really think Russia wants to open a second front?

We will call ourselves the Free Americans since AntiFA stands for Anti Free Americans AKA the ones who want to bring back slavery. Lets turn the tables on these fascists fucks. This guy who said we should call ourselves blue shirts and wear black ties tucked in thought that would make us not look like Nazis. OK fucker lets call ourselves the blue shirts instead of brown shirts??? We shouldn&#039;t have a consistent uniform. We will wear either solid red, white, or blue color shirts with an American flag patch sewed onto it. That&#039;s the fuckin uniform. We are the Americans or the Free Americans and we fight the communist, new KKK, anti American, racist, Anti Free speech, pro slavery group that calls themselves Antifa. <br><br>https:\/\/m.liveleak.com\/view?i=9bc_1<wbr>492995052","filename":"IMG_1416","ext":".png","w":722,"h":373,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":129,"tim":1493350644522,"time":1493350644,"md5":"BeJ0MeZ89pEbH1vbJJmc5w==","fsize":604614,"resto":0,"id":"vDlKKEv0","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"does-antifa-relize-that-they-are-the-fascists-my","country_name":"United States","replies":146,"images":23,"omitted_posts":141,"omitted_images":23,"tail_size":50},{"no":123161050,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)02:45:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123160366\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123160366<\/a><br>Top kek.

These combination toilet-bidets (washlet) with seat warmers, or attachable bidets are particularly popular in Japan and South Korea, found in approximately 60% of households.[citation needed] They are commonly found in hotels and even some public facilities.

WMAW sons like Elliot grow up and see first hand how bad Asian women really are, which is why they only go for white women and would rather die than date an Asian woman, but when they realize society is deeply racist against men who look Asian, they take out their internalized racist hatred on Asian men whom they scapegoat for their failure and white women who they perceive to be rejecting them.<br><br>That is the huge difference between AMWW and WMAW.

Whereas there isn&#039;t a punishment for the clothes and foods, and he doesn&#039;t hold it against the other nations that they eat and dress differently. A lot of those things were to give Israel a culture (food, clothing, manners) separate from their surroundings, so that they felt separate and didn&#039;t intermingle with the surrounding nations. (He said that he didn&#039;t want that to happen a number of times.) Some of those laws seemed strange to me too, because initially I tended to lump them all in as &quot;commandments from God&quot;, but when I read the Bible, I realized that much of it is just creating a culture, and much of it is simply case-law.

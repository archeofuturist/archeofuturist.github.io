CALL YOUR FUCKING CONGRESSMAN. Pick up your phone. Right now. It takes THREE minutes.<br><br>&quot;Hello, my name is ________. I am a strong supporter of Donald Trump. Over a 511-day election season, he has repeatedly promised no more foreign intervention, and he has promised to cooperate with Russia to take on ISIS. Now, there are rumors - unfounded rumors, but rumors nonetheless - that he is considering to intervene in Syria. I did NOT vote for this, my family did NOT vote for this, and should this happen, we will NOT be voting for the Republican Party during the midterm elections OR the presidential election of 2020.&quot;<br><br>IT TAKES FIVE MINUTES.

This general is for the discussion of Marxism-Leninism, the ideology of revolutionary socialism and communism.<br><br>Communism is the next stage of humanity following the capitalist stage.<br><br>What exactly is communism according to Marxist-Leninists:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Communism is a stage of society in which the productive infrastructure is socially owned, and goods are produced not in order to sell for profit, but in order to meet a social need.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Communism in it&#039;s full form is a stateless, classless society that follows the maxim &quot;From each according to their ability, to each according to their need.&quot;<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;To achieve such a society Marxism-Leninism teaches us that we must replace the capitalist state, which is controlled by the capitalist class, by a socialist state, which is controlled by the working class. Then, a period of class struggle follows in which the capitalist class is liquidated by the working class. When the capitalist class has been completely vanquished, there will be only one class, the working class, and eventually the functions of the state will become indistinguishable from the functions of the society as a whole, and the state as such will &#039;wither away&#039; as Marx said.<\/span><br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/ma<wbr>rx\/works\/1847\/11\/prin-com.htm<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/ma<wbr>rx\/works\/1848\/communist-manifesto\/<br><br>ML uses a philosophy called dialectical materialism, see here:<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/reference\/<wbr>archive\/stalin\/works\/1938\/09.htm<br><br>It is recommended that you read some of the critical works of Marxism-Leninism so you can make an informed assessment of the ideology.<br><br>Resources:<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/ma<wbr>rx\/works\/sw\/<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/le<wbr>nin\/works\/sw\/<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/reference\/<wbr>archive\/stalin\/works\/decades-index.<wbr>htm<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/reference\/<wbr>archive\/mao\/selected-works\/<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/ma<wbr>rx\/works\/1884\/origin-family\/<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/le<wbr>nin\/works\/1914\/mar\/11.htm","filename":"1481244074852","ext":".png","w":1010,"h":1010,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491504801914,"time":1491504801,"md5":"676S1nirnOI5InkeibSxFw==","fsize":177742,"resto":0,"id":"mMv9Qakm","country":"ES","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"pol-communism-general","country_name":"Spain","replies":58,"images":48,"omitted_posts":53,"omitted_images":46},{"no":119785200,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)15:55:06","name":"Anonymous","filename":"The Brave","ext":".jpg","w":5268,"h":2080,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":49,"tim":1491508506553,"time":1491508506,"md5":"WwLyLVmD\/ZVrt+5F8pQR1g==","fsize":1939949,"resto":119776914,"id":"N4QO24g0","country":"DE","m_img":1,"country_name":"Germany"},{"no":119785213,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)15:55:13","name":"Anonymous","filename":"1490126352400","ext":".jpg","w":540,"h":477,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":110,"tim":1491508513827,"time":1491508513,"md5":"gKUsE4GeFEhNyXsTWB+9CQ==","fsize":91921,"resto":119776914,"id":"mMv9Qakm","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":119785317,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)15:55:57","name":"Anonymous","filename":"24e977069a3f76c50c3f47abe6b5e796f37dbbcbfe87de0f3a3b8d1c995cbe97","ext":".png","w":640,"h":457,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":89,"tim":1491508557938,"time":1491508557,"md5":"uKKE+WZVZL+EYEo8PEag7w==","fsize":450125,"resto":119776914,"id":"mMv9Qakm","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":119785459,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)15:56:58","name":"Anonymous","filename":"6fb306a90caa2ebb3fcfcb52e64db5483ed91af2","ext":".jpg","w":630,"h":630,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491508618813,"time":1491508618,"md5":"2Mf0dusmEP0UjnOv48ExlQ==","fsize":83681,"resto":119776914,"id":"mMv9Qakm","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":119785509,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)15:57:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119784856\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119784856<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;industrial output is better than ones individual GDP or a countrys GDP<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;we were doing great, thats why we begged every country on earth for resources,weapons,food,medicine etc because we were to busy creating god knows what but still couldnt even feed the people atleast once a day<\/span><br>wow, really showed me. wtf i love communism now","filename":"why brittain declared war","ext":".jpg","w":807,"h":883,"tn_w":114,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491508642835,"time":1491508642,"md5":"UsWIVHUsPv8nx5aLYgDdOw==","fsize":145022,"resto":119776914,"id":"oRj0RM\/0","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}]}

Men who keep themselves from falling to quickly into the relationship trap have more time to build assets and job security while avoiding debt and divorce traps rigged by the jew. Meanwhile, the weak-minded and more degenerate women get picked off by niggers and other multiculturalist agents who end up murdering them or leaving them with mongrel children looking for gullible cucks willing to provide a meal ticket. <br><br>In the end, the ones that are left are men of means who have the benefit of experience through learning from the mistakes of those who failed and the smart women who knew better than to lay with animals and see the benefit of conforming to what men want in a stable relationship partner. And from those, smarter and more successful children are born. <br><br>Of course, going MGTOW forever is suicide, but holding off until you are in your late 20s to early 30s means a more quality relationship while avoiding the typical traps set by the jew to enslave you with debt, alimony and child support.","time":1490502792,"resto":118318144,"id":"KuI0Pwgx","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118319836,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)00:33:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118318310\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118318310<\/a><br><br>MGTOW wants to kill feminism and mainstream culture and advertising pushing degeneracy<br><br>its a last ditch effort before western civ collapses<br><br>on the side it will also kill the jewish controlled diamond and wedding industry","time":1490502824,"resto":118318144,"id":"h7rM8Wra","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118321026,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)00:46:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118319789\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118319789<\/a><br><br>this too<br><br>its social darwinism, key word SOCIAL, not sexual, S O C I A L, as in society, how humans interact with one another, how they lie and deceive and use other personalities to play off one another, <br><br>not pseudo tribalist hedonist society of &quot;BRO I FUCKED X BITCHES SO IM MORE IMPORTANT&quot; which now a days benefits from modern society<br><br>MGTOW removes the backup marriage options from women in society and forces the Alpha positives to deal with the degenerate Alpha negative assclowns (see niggers and corrupt trash) of the world holding back society when women start turning on them once women realize they dont have anyone to provide financial support because the economy is shit thanks to the alpha positives who drank the socialist koolaid\/ were out breeded by beta socialists in a democratic system<br><br>of course alpha positve wont like alpha negative fucking with their families, so they will either be forced to break the laws in dealing with alpha negative (which is bad because we a re a society of laws) or they decide it needs to be abolished (which is more respectable), and then they can deal with femenism easier<br><br><br>either way, it forces alpha positives to reverse on democracy all together, and MGTOW will be best prepared for that world","time":1490503597,"resto":118318144,"id":"h7rM8Wra","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118323130,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)01:10:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118318813\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118318813<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;318813<\/span><br><br>What did Thoth mean by this?","time":1490505042,"resto":118318144,"id":"SStc1U3X","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118323222,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)01:11:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118321026\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118321026<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;its social darwinism<\/span><br>Why are you guys so ashamed of being beta virgins?

The resulting multi-lens system provides an opportunity to help correct aberration, a condition where lenses fail to bring all wavelengths of color to a single focal point, which in turn may facilitate higher quality imaging from smaller devices, researchers added.<br><br>The researchers developed the 3D lenses by blasting a light-sensitive material onto a glass substrate with a femtosecond laser, which has pulse durations shorter than 100 femtoseconds. The material then absorbed two photons that exposed it and crosslinked polymers within the material. The unexposed material was washed using a solvent, leaving the hardened, crosslinked polymer that will then serve as the optical element.<br><br>The resulting lens\u2019 diameter measures about 120 millionths of a meter, which makes it easily as small as a grain of table salt. The lenses can go from wide to narrow and may provide low to high image resolutions. Each of the lenses has a specific line of sight \u2013 clear at the center, blurry at the sides \u2013 capped by a curvature at the end. This mechanism mimics how the fovea, the small depression in the middle of the retina, collects light, and how the brain connects images from both eyes to come up with a single, distinct picture.","filename":"bre1","ext":".jpg","w":1084,"h":626,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":144,"tim":1490498345935,"time":1490498345,"md5":"XC6zDkcjKPwFMqlYjpudRQ==","fsize":72220,"resto":0,"id":"5bQNx5UM","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"its-over-niggers-the-jews-won","country_name":"United States","replies":107,"images":26,"omitted_posts":102,"omitted_images":26,"tail_size":50},{"no":118322118,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)00:59:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"HERE IS MORE NORMIE FREINDLY INFO ON THE TOPIC.

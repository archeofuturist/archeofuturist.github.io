On Tuesday, Lambda Legal joined the suit, which seeks damages for breach of contract, negligent misrepresentation, and the intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress. Zawadski and Gaspari aren\u2019t suing the funeral home for engaging in anti-gay discrimination because Mississippi does not protect LGBTQ people from refusal of service. Indeed, the state\u2019s notorious HB 1523 actually protects businesses\u2019 right to turn away LGBTQ customers\u2014though the courts have put that law on hold for now.<br><br>Initially, the nearby Picayune Funeral Home seemed like a perfect choice, and Gaspari paid the company $1,795 to transport and cremate Huskey\u2019s body once he passed. But when Huskey died and the nursing home contacted the funeral home to pick up his body, it refused to do so. The funeral home had discovered that Huskey\u2019s next-of-kin was his husband, and realizing Huskey was gay, informed the nursing home that it did not \u201cdeal with their kind.\u201d","filename":"urn","ext":".jpg","w":450,"h":450,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493758535238,"time":1493758535,"md5":"V1p5v7PgCP\/FWUdDGSQAxQ==","fsize":71251,"resto":0,"id":"UOfJ+qHL","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"man-sues-antigay-mississippi-funeral-home-for","country_name":"United States","replies":8,"images":1,"omitted_posts":3,"omitted_images":0},{"no":123819478,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)17:07:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123819124\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123819124<\/a><br>I&#039;m not sure how a funeral home cremating a dead guy would be considered an endorsement of homosexuality\/violate any specific religious beliefs though.","time":1493759254,"resto":123818002,"id":"UOfJ+qHL","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123819784,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)17:09:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123819478\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123819478<\/a><br>I agree.

Really obvious way to tell when you&#039;re speaking to a lying kike or someone pretending they&#039;ve read Mein kampf, but haven&#039;t. Here&#039;s what it actually says:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;By handing Russia to Bolshevism, it robbed the Russian nation of that intelligentsia which previously brought about and guaranteed its existence as a state. For the organization of a Russian state formation was not the result of the political abilities of the Slavs in Russia, but only a wonderful example of the state-forming efficacity of the German element in an inferior race. Numerous mighty empires on earth have been created in this way. Lower nations led by Germanic organizers and overlords have more than once grown to be mighty state formations and have endured as long as the racial nudeus of the creative state race maintained itself. For centuries Russia drew nourishment from this Germanic nucleus of its upper leading strata. Today it can be regarded as almost totally exterminated and extinguished. It has been replaced by the Jew. Impossible as it is for the Russian by himself to shake off the yoke of the Jew by his own resources, it is equally impossible for the Jew to maintain the mighty empire forever. He himself is no element of organization, but a ferment of decomposition. The Persian I empire in the east is ripe for collapse. And the end of Jewish rule in Russia will also be the end of Russia as a state. We have been chosen by Fate as witnesses of a catastrophe which will be the mightiest confirmation of the soundness of the folkish theory.<\/span>","filename":"germanized_russians_vs_bolshevik_jews","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":852,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":104,"tim":1493758116282,"time":1493758116,"md5":"ILO3QpKJnX6Dd\/iNVs55Bg==","fsize":142374,"resto":123771963,"id":"ZJeor4gp","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123817357,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)16:50:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123771963\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123771963<\/a><br>New cross thread<br><br>Who ever gets elected in France , we&#039;ll still win.<br><br><a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/123815490#p123815490\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123815490<\/a> (Cross-thread)","time":1493758222,"resto":123771963,"id":"g\/fVF+PI","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123818520,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)16:59:34","name":"k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a","filename":"Aryan","ext":".jpg","w":1600,"h":2400,"tn_w":83,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493758774525,"time":1493758774,"md5":"BbrMkF\/78t+f+WwBnVjg9Q==","fsize":346539,"resto":123771963,"id":"Du9laX5V","country":"GB","m_img":1,"trip":"!!8ulOY0Lj8qr","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123820205,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)17:13:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123796863\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123796863<\/a><br>that&#039;s very sad to read","time":1493759606,"resto":123771963,"id":"9Qw6LQKV","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"}]},{"posts":[{"no":123810256,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)15:53:34","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Chechens are whiter than any Southern European","com":"Prove me wrong","filename":"chechen_mujahid_by_0243design-d5ckjbz","ext":".png","w":800,"h":600,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1493754814632,"time":1493754814,"md5":"j90WBob0GsyAcMyl3xyjqw==","fsize":1030860,"resto":0,"id":"Zm8sYxkL","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"chechens-are-whiter-than-any-southern-european","country_name":"United States","replies":65,"images":19,"omitted_posts":60,"omitted_images":19},{"no":123819617,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)17:08:34","name":"Anon","com":"There was a previous thread related to them.<br><br>They&#039;re discussing where did they come from, ethnicity.<br><br><a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/123675672#p123675672\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123675672<\/a><br><br><a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/123675672#p123700703\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123700703<\/a><br><a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/123675672#p123699174\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123699174<\/a><br><a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/123675672#p123704106\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123704106<\/a><br><a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/123675672#p123712739\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123712739<\/a><br><br>Th thread also talks about Kadyrov, Chechen Wars, they wanting EU refugee status to get gibsmedat, and some gay shills ranting about the &quot;gay Shoah&quot; in Chechenya<br><br>There are a lot of Chechen diaspora here in \/pol\/.

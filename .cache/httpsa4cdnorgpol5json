Have you not heard of nuclear weapons? <br><br>Perhaps this adendum to the Fermi Paradox can illustrate the fallacy that is technological &quot;progress.&quot;<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;This is the argument that technological civilizations may usually or invariably destroy themselves before or shortly after developing radio or spaceflight technology. Possible means of annihilation are many,[68] including war, accidental environmental contamination or damage, resource depletion,[69] or poorly designed artificial intelligence. This general theme is explored both in fiction and in scientific hypothesizing.[70] In 1966, Sagan and Shklovskii speculated that technological civilizations will either tend to destroy themselves within a century of developing interstellar communicative capability or master their self-destructive tendencies and survive for billion-year timescales.[71] Self-annihilation may also be viewed in terms of thermodynamics: insofar as life is an ordered system that can sustain itself against the tendency to disorder, the &quot;external transmission&quot; or interstellar communicative phase may be the point at which the system becomes unstable and self-destructs.<\/span>","time":1490766930,"resto":118747514,"id":"tDHjme5V","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118754278,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)01:56:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118754009\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118754009<\/a><br>I agree but you have to account for all possible visions of a globalist society if you want your answer to stick.

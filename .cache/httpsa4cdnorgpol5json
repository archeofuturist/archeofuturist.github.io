We have enjoyed many more freedoms here in the U.S.A. than other counties have or continue to have but we are losing them. The Federal Government became more centralized overtime when it realized it needed more power to provide law and order within the new country such as during Bacon&#039;s Rebellion. Sure, the founders feared the common people especially after what happened during the French Revolution and there has always been a check on the will of the masses perhaps for good reason, but I would argue that now the elite have over infringed upon their place in society. We did win but we slowly became what we hated. The Russian revolution was crippled from the beginning because it assumes a natural hierarchy based upon the abilities one was born with with no chance for social mobility. From each according to his ability to each according to his need. In America we believe all men (now women too) are create equal. It seems though that some men have become more equal than others which has led us to our current predicament.

Concerning that \/pol\/ was about to be kill, the original users made a discord and advertised the discord on the thread. Month after month hundreds and thousands of users flocked to the discord for a more structured and organized place for politically incorrect discussion. There were raids against many foes and friendships were founded with other discords. Many famous autists and kameraden from the board passed through the doors of the server. There was drama, too much fucking drama holy shit.Over that time the community grew and grew. New channels were introduced to represent the growing community and the mod group was expanded. Happenings happened, memes were memed, and there was autism on a scale that had never been seen before. A lot of fun times are had in this discord, and every night when you hop on you; will see channels full of people talking in text. You hop on voice chat in the general channels and you hear \/pol\/, in all its grandeur.

NY Times Article<br>In recent months, a group under the auspices of the Carnegie Council in New York, led by Janos Pasztor, a former United Nations climate official, has begun to work through the thorny international issues of governance and ethics.

Jasanoff also points out that each technology potentially enables rogue agents to act without societal consent.","time":1492918136,"resto":122369263,"id":"P13map5G","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122373022,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)23:31:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"the fuck is your point?","time":1492918261,"resto":122369263,"id":"R6Y\/SV\/r","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":122373316,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)23:33:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122373022\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122373022<\/a><br>How about read the archives linked if you do not understand the snippets and how it is impacting our lives right now.","time":1492918412,"resto":122369263,"id":"P13map5G","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122373668,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)23:36:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122373316\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122373316<\/a><br>What are you gonna do about it?<br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=NkU<wbr>TGpegZN0","filename":"odom-no-flinch","ext":".png","w":1280,"h":720,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1492918586291,"time":1492918586,"md5":"TuCPuBdyNBIhTSs0z1iEAA==","fsize":2212986,"resto":122369263,"id":"R6Y\/SV\/r","country":"NO","m_img":1,"country_name":"Norway"},{"no":122374317,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)23:42:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122369263\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122369263<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;CCS<\/span><br>Have fun with that","time":1492918948,"resto":122369263,"id":"6Cm1mBw3","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":122373346,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)23:33:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"Ask a quadracial person anything","filename":"Race-OpeningPostcard-v3-Front","ext":".jpg","w":737,"h":1024,"tn_w":179,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492918426152,"time":1492918426,"md5":"9OwlHVJMfFHCvs1KohORpQ==","fsize":191759,"resto":0,"id":"MBX\/a4Ci","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"ask-a-quadracial-person-anything","country_name":"United States","replies":11,"images":2,"omitted_posts":6,"omitted_images":2},{"no":122373716,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)23:36:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122373346\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122373346<\/a><br>Being you must be a hell","time":1492918611,"resto":122373346,"id":"UUwMqiNM","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":122373740,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)23:37:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122373346\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122373346<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;quadracial<\/span><br>mutt","time":1492918622,"resto":122373346,"id":"zJWYR\/4N","country":"MY","country_name":"Malaysia"},{"no":122373773,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)23:37:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122373346\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122373346<\/a><br>How many special snowflake points do you get with libtards?

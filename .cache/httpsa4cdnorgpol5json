Not the most relevant ones but things you might find interesting anyway:<br>Most business owners are actually a lot dumber than they look, and the reason they succeed is that they just know the right people. Or perhaps it&#039;s not really that they&#039;re dumb, it&#039;s just that they know they don&#039;t need to be that smart. <br>Simple and predictable let you and everyone else focus on making money elsewhere. Of course there are exceptions, for example, Google reinvented the yellow pages; keep an eye on things like these if you can, especially if you are new, but also make sure you don&#039;t miss real opportunities because you&#039;re too busy reinventing something irrelevant.<br>Don&#039;t be afraid to take other peoples&#039; money and get into partnerships, but make sure they are good ones. The key to any successful partnership is that the partners make more money together than they would otherwise. Make sure you pull your own weight and you will be safe; but if you don&#039;t, don&#039;t rely on honesty or whatever keeping you in. Also don&#039;t obsess over details, whether you like your partners, how hard they work, etc. Just ask yourself, at the end of the year\/term\/whatever, will I have more or less money without him?<br>Personal relationships are extremely important, perhaps the most important thing of them all. You don&#039;t need to be objectively the best, if you know the right people. Or, rather, you are objectively the best if you&#039;re &#039;decent&#039;, and also a lot more trustworthy and easier to work with than some new hotshot who might represent a risk or require a lot of oversight. The time your business partners don&#039;t spend in you is time they spend making money elsewhere.","time":1492250025,"resto":121191014,"id":"2EXFfpzH","country":"UY","country_name":"Uruguay"}]},{"posts":[{"no":121153074,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)22:13:29","name":"Anonymous","sub":"\/sg\/ - Syria General - God bless Syria Edition","com":"Everything you need to know<br>https:\/\/syriagenerals.wordpress.com<wbr>\/<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;YouTube<\/span><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCS<wbr>elGrgxKyKFrugrfns3FBA\/<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Twitter<\/span><br>https:\/\/twitter.com\/SyriaGeneral<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;SOUTHFRONT Apr14<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/3UiI2OQ0Yb4 <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Newest Interviews with Assad<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/Bnpy7mrGMS0 [NEW] <br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/ZpgYBIDk43Q <br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/MlrpvKNl9D8<br><br>PERMANENT MAPS<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Maeplet<\/span><br>http:\/\/maeplet.com\/<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Livemap<\/span><br>https:\/\/globaleventmap.org<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;hohol livemap<\/span><br>http:\/\/syria.liveuamap.com\/<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Military map<\/span><br>http:\/\/militarymaps.info\/<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Syria conflict map<\/span><br>http:\/\/www.cartercenter.org\/syria-c<wbr>onflict-map\/<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Fan maps<\/span><br>https:\/\/twitter.com\/syria_protector<wbr><br>https:\/\/twitter.com\/PetoLucem<br>https:\/\/twitter.com\/miladvisor<br>https:\/\/twitter.com\/a7_mirza<br>https:\/\/twitter.com\/hamza_780<br>http:\/\/www.edmaps.com<br>http:\/\/www.syriancivilwarmap.com<br><br>RECENT MAPS<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Raqqa Apr14<\/span><br>http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/iGgcY7F.jpg<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Jobar Arp14<\/span><br>http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/NXDtN1k.jpg<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Daara Apr14<\/span><br>http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/9CpwSOJ.jpg<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mosul Apr13<\/span><br>http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/Hpq09Sg.jpg<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;N Aleppo Apr11<\/span><br>http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/yFn46c9.jpg<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Palmyra Apr11<\/span><br>http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/nB560y0.jpg<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;N Hama Apr3<\/span><br>http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/vVulpSs.jpg<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;DeZ Feb23<\/span><br>http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/NqoTYa2.jpg<br><br>Developments Apr14<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;SAA encircles Al-Qaboun District<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;N Hama:SAA offensive in axis of Halfaya faild<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;DeZ:SAA offensive continues, new hiltop captured, 3Km from airport<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Daara:HTS captures 2 SAA army bases<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;2jihadist strongholds in W Damascus under SAA control after pop swap<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Phase 4 of Raqqa operation begun, SDF ~30KIA, allegedly US SOF ~20 KIA<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Terrorists withdraw their forces from Anadan [n Aleppo]<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Coalition planes kill 18 SDF with friendly bomb<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Assad:Khan Shaykhun was a false flag<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;UNSC transcript by based Brazilbro <a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/120792007#p120792007\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120792007<\/a> or https:\/\/pastebin.com\/VB75kRZr<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;China FM: New korean war might break out,Air China to suspend Beijing-Pyongyang flights<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;N Korea: In case of US aggression ready to strike US bases in Jap&amp;S Korea+aircraftcarrier<\/span><br><br>Previous: <a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/121121289#p121121289\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121121289<\/a>","filename":"C9Z29eFUAAA5P7f","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":480,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1492222409679,"time":1492222409,"md5":"GPz6wzXCFE3lnJXu4EXogA==","fsize":39490,"resto":0,"id":"SWYSGDQO","country":"MX","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"sg-syria-general-god-bless-syria-edition","country_name":"Mexico","replies":182,"images":82,"omitted_posts":177,"omitted_images":77,"tail_size":50},{"no":121193408,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)05:41:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;N.

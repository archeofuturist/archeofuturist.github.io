CNN had an interview with a pedo as well. You could tell the interviewer was about to crawl out of her skin. Trasngenders make up less than 1% of the population, yet the Left is pushing trans acceptance hard now. There are two reasons. The first is political expedience. The legalization of gay marriage effectively tool away a major rallying point for the liberal cause. They needed a new one, hence, the Transgender acceptance campaign. The second reason is to normalize pedophilia. If a prepubescent child has the cognitive ability to &quot;choose their gender,&quot; it follows that they also have the cognitive ability to consent to sex with an adult. This will be the line of argument. The articles and interviews were a tentative probe to see if the public was ready for pedophiles to be normalized. (they&#039;re like us, they just want to fuck kids.) They pulled back after the backlash. Instead, they&#039;re going full bore on the transgender normilization.

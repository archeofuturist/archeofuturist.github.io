Try actually reading &quot;The Confessions&quot;. Admittedly, you have to admire the guy for keeping his word in that book. He starts off by boasting that he is going to do something no one has ever done before him: give a completely truthful portrait of his life. Particularly because the book was written a long time ago, before the modern vogue for ugliness and sordidness in literature, you think to yourself, when you read that &quot;yeah, cool story bro&quot;.<br><br>But he then proceeds to confess to having done things that people would hesitate to confess to having done even today in the degenerate, shameless 21st Century: getting people punished for crimes he himself had committed; abandoning sick friends in the middle of the street in strange cities, and above all a series of truly degrading sexual perversions, including lurking in alleyways to expose himself to young girls coming to fetch water from a well and being repeatedly chased away and beaten by their relatives or boyfriends.<br><br>The reason why the claim that &quot;Rousseau ruined everything&quot; is one that can be strongly argued for is because Rousseau somehow seemed psychologically to be able to combine this awareness that he was a criminal, a coward, a pervert and a monster with the belief that he was a saint, or at least someone infinitely purer and more virtuous than 99% of the people around him. In that respect, he provides the model and the specious justification for characters like Robespierre and Marat - who really DID ruin everything by establishing the type of the dictator who commits mass murder in order to establish &quot;the reign of love and virtue&quot;.","time":1492344310,"resto":121341824,"id":"YxOfs31A","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":121351629,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)08:08:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"This cock sucker sold us out.","filename":"IMG_7581","ext":".jpg","w":605,"h":328,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":67,"tim":1492344485531,"time":1492344485,"md5":"Lj4BNTbru0+QO\/2AmldKjQ==","fsize":37012,"resto":121341824,"id":"xe1pPt6k","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":121351627,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)08:08:05","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Battle of Berkley","com":"JUDGED","filename":"1492294094290","ext":".jpg","w":756,"h":429,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":141,"tim":1492344485300,"time":1492344485,"md5":"jyclbcUh6Ely4JqgRKqZhw==","fsize":47903,"resto":0,"id":"0dNNJiTf","country":"PT","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"battle-of-berkley","country_name":"Portugal","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":121342824,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)05:55:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"Daily reminder that the Jews killed Jesus.<br><br>Jews are the number one foe of Christians.","filename":"Jews","ext":".png","w":1916,"h":849,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":110,"tim":1492336533839,"time":1492336533,"md5":"derrlObDpxLPOdDtWSuzPA==","fsize":3548087,"resto":0,"id":"kxZgdHNn","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"daily-reminder-that-the-jews-killed-jesus","country_name":"United States","replies":24,"images":3,"omitted_posts":19,"omitted_images":1},{"no":121351158,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)08:01:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121342824\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121342824<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Disciples were Jews<\/span><br><br>non-Messianic Jews are the problem anon.","time":1492344084,"resto":121342824,"id":"caNYJcqO","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121351227,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)08:02:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121343363\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121343363<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Jesus<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;jew<\/span><br>Nice memerino, goldstein","time":1492344147,"resto":121342824,"id":"zypBR0rZ","country":"MX","country_name":"Mexico"},{"no":121351342,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)08:04:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121345595\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121345595<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;wanting a timeline of we wuz chosen n shit.<\/span>","time":1492344243,"resto":121342824,"id":"Ix6eTImi","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121351483,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)08:06:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121349759\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121349759<\/a><br>Thissssss.","time":1492344361,"resto":121342824,"id":"gnuSRLPc","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":121351605,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)08:07:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121345505\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121345505<\/a><br>No except for the part where the bible originates from judaism","time":1492344470,"resto":121342824,"id":"gnuSRLPc","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"}]},{"posts":[{"no":121347595,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)07:08:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;(((NGOs))) act as a ferry service between North Africa and Europe, bringing thousands upon thousands of migrants that would never have made it otherwise<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;mostly use relatively small and easily sinkable converted fishing boats, oil supply ships etc<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;underwater cutting torches and scuba rebreathers can be bought for a couple of thousand dollars<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;a few dedicated patriots could wipe out the entire (((rescue))) industry in a few nights<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;if they weren&#039;t stupid about it, no one would be hurt and they would never be caught<\/span><br><br>So why haven&#039;t you put those scuba lessons you learnt on that ladyboy holiday to Koh Samui to the test and done your part to save Europe?","filename":"maxresdefault","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":720,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1492340931216,"time":1492340931,"md5":"F7zGB+zgcD3wEMKThUEi0w==","fsize":54685,"resto":0,"id":"yR\/jKAwU","country":"AU","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"ngos-act-as-a-ferry-service-between-north-africa","country_name":"Australia","replies":2,"images":0},{"no":121349629,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)07:39:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121347595\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121347595<\/a><br>they are not NGO&#039;s.

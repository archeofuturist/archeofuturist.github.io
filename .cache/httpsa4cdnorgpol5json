Concerning that \/pol\/ was about to be kill, the original users made a discord and advertised the discord on the thread. Month after month hundreds and thousands of users flocked to the discord for a more structured and organized place for politically incorrect discussion. There were raids against many foes and friendships were founded with other discords. Many famous autists and kameraden from the board passed through the doors of the server. There was drama, too much fucking drama holy shit.Over that time the community grew and grew. New channels were introduced to represent the growing community and the mod group was expanded. Happenings happened, memes were memed, and there was autism on a scale that had never been seen before. A lot of fun times are had in this discord, and every night when you hop on you; will see channels full of people talking in text. You hop on voice chat in the general channels and you hear \/pol\/, in all its grandeur.

There is consciousness everywhere. There are beings all around us that are invisible. We are invisible to them. Like humans some are good some are malevolent and some are a mix. We can&#039;t interact with or sense them physically but we can psychically under certain conditions. Most of these beings are not even complete individuals, they are like psychic parasites and they cannot exist separate from us. Insanity, dreams, shamanic rituals and hallucinogens essentially open the doorway between our worlds. Sometimes these beings help or hurt people. Every culture has a tradition regarding how to interact with and (if need be) control them. These range from good things like exorcism to diabolical witchcraft.<br><br>I would recommend reading Transcendental Magic by Eliphas Levi, the Three Books by Agrippa, and The Secret Teachings of All Ages by Manly P.

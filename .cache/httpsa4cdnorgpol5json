New legislation merged the Crown and the old East India Company courts and introduced a new penal code as well as new codes of civil and criminal procedure, based largely on English law. In the 1860s\u20131880s the Raj set up compulsory registration of births, deaths, and marriages, as well as adoptions, property deeds, and wills. The goal was to create a stable, usable public record and verifiable identities. However, there was opposition from both Muslim and Hindu elements who complained that the new procedures for census-taking and registration threatened to uncover female privacy. Purdah rules prohibited women from saying their husband&#039;s name or having their photograph taken. An all-India census was conducted between 1868 and 1871, often using total numbers of females in a household rather than individual names. Select groups which the Raj reformers wanted to monitor statistically included those reputed to practice female infanticide, prostitutes, lepers, and eunuchs.<\/span>","time":1492611903,"resto":121844940,"id":"RXORmQxL","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121849176,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)10:27:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121844940\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121844940<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;There is no sound of flushing water in the villages, only an eternity of squatting and shitting in the streets and the laughter of their animal gods<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;and the laughter of their animal gods<\/span><br><br>maximum laff","filename":"1486409794057","ext":".png","w":720,"h":582,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":101,"tim":1492612039877,"time":1492612039,"md5":"wJWekZwknzbrN2x+4d1jnA==","fsize":183129,"resto":121844940,"id":"sOojc8+2","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121849190,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)10:27:26","name":"Anonymous","filename":"indian mansion","ext":".jpg","w":366,"h":409,"tn_w":111,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492612046310,"time":1492612046,"md5":"a94zO0Ighh\/C8I5SIOXMgA==","fsize":65103,"resto":121844940,"id":"Xjznx6zy","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121849204,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)10:27:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121848957\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121848957<\/a><br><br>He&#039;s not saying that&#039;s a Bad Thing, he&#039;s saying he&#039;s upset it wasn&#039;t Japan who would have appreciated being raped and looted so much more","filename":"maximum-belgium","ext":".jpg","w":1373,"h":1739,"tn_w":98,"tn_h":124,"tim":1492612056318,"time":1492612056,"md5":"Q3wPEh7iwvq56AQlaZ7dLw==","fsize":217268,"resto":121844940,"id":"GlrUxGab","country":"GB","m_img":1,"country_name":"United Kingdom"}]},{"posts":[{"no":121843743,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)09:27:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"the call that saved mcdonalds","filename":"170417153401-steve-stephens-phone-full-169","ext":".jpg","w":1600,"h":900,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1492608458358,"time":1492608458,"md5":"FzI9xlHrrhL19pCkdMGJpw==","fsize":106098,"resto":0,"id":"U0J8AbQb","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-call-that-saved-mcdonalds","country_name":"United States","replies":14,"images":4,"omitted_posts":9,"omitted_images":3},{"no":121846220,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)09:55:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121846102\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121846102<\/a><br>Of course not you dum dum<br><br>You can tell by the pixels","time":1492610114,"resto":121843743,"id":"mb8lCPVI","country":"AR","country_name":"Argentina"},{"no":121846269,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)09:55:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121846102\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121846102<\/a><br>Yes it is.","time":1492610148,"resto":121843743,"id":"3r8Bn2N4","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121846342,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)09:56:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"Rip Aaron Hernandez, God&#039;s sweetest little angel baby boy","filename":"PicsArt_04-19-08.06.39","ext":".jpg","w":540,"h":655,"tn_w":103,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492610198516,"time":1492610198,"md5":"tQUp3aox6tDahrbmfozThw==","fsize":76336,"resto":121843743,"id":"kZHG1qq1","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121846783,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)10:01:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121846102\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121846102<\/a><br>no- the &quot;dark white skin&quot;

You can feed yourself for $150\/month, and pay the bills for maybe $200\/month, thus staying alive for under $5k a year in your $20k house. Alternately, you could eat out sometimes, buy beer on weekends, own a car, etc. and double or triple that easily. Post-scarcity is this dynamic on steroids.<br><br>The idea of communism is AFAICT that all material goods will be so easy to create that everyone can own a car, drink beer, eat tasty food, and the total cost will be a bare fraction of the total productivity of society. At some point, anyone still working who DOESN&#039;T have access to basic material goods will be really pissed off, and those people will rise up and take over. Since doing work is a core value of the working class, the value system post-revolution will prize and reward people who work with the resources that are still scarce: living in good areas, public recognition, interesting work, services like daycares and taxis and dry cleaners, rarities like white truffles or diamonds, etc. The difference is that only zero-sum goods will be awarded for hard work: post-scarcity ensures that most material goods are virtually unlimited.<br><br>This seems pretty fucking stupid and overcomplicated to me, but whatever.","time":1492610635,"resto":121840903,"id":"C8khFbsd","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":121849157,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)10:27:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121847011\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121847011<\/a><br>What do you mean by zero-sum goods?<br><br>Also, I think you pretty much hit the nail on the head, OP is forgetting that technology is making human labour less and less necessary every year.","time":1492612032,"resto":121840903,"id":"8uC9isSy","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"}]},{"posts":[{"no":121849144,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)10:27:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;tfw we were winning bigly a few months ago<\/span><br><br>How did it all go so wrong?","filename":"IMG_7338","ext":".jpg","w":368,"h":1033,"tn_w":89,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492612027514,"time":1492612027,"md5":"Syoe0\/Wlqxfq6hKebswxKA==","fsize":97865,"resto":0,"id":"+XYAmwc1","country":"AU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"tfw-we-were-winning-bigly-a-few-months-ago","country_name":"Australia","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":121823820,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)05:03:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"Post bands that share your political outlook","filename":"ratm","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":500,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492592589868,"time":1492592589,"md5":"bPwIlojmnhFxL5SfviGsBA==","fsize":47136,"resto":0,"id":"fXv1Tuia","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"post-bands-that-share-your-political-outlook","country_name":"United States","replies":161,"images":65,"omitted_posts":156,"omitted_images":61,"tail_size":50},{"no":121848605,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)10:21:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121823820\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121823820<\/a><br>I&#039;ll just leave this here","filename":"onlyalad","ext":".jpg","w":1000,"h":1000,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492611697898,"time":1492611697,"md5":"L9wbl9P8nkV61gR3dYgG7g==","fsize":359323,"resto":121823820,"id":"GQsumCFr","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121848660,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)10:22:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121823820\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121823820<\/a><br>do you fker know that burning monk was fake?","filename":"why_me","ext":".jpg","w":675,"h":576,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":106,"tim":1492611730087,"time":1492611730,"md5":"IFFnq1bWAQJHcSYSnOofwg==","fsize":43445,"resto":121823820,"id":"tfPGVnYL","country":"VN","country_name":"Vietnam"},{"no":121848880,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)10:24:17","name":"Anonymous","filename":"a0472586567_10","ext":".jpg","w":1200,"h":1200,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492611857541,"time":1492611857,"md5":"QVq36fJUzg2qfuEZvAG4XQ==","fsize":542764,"resto":121823820,"id":"JTb3QR64","country":"SE","m_img":1,"country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":121848974,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)10:25:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121847806\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121847806<\/a><br>He&#039;s made money off them and he&#039;s redpilled.

I suggest checking out the Army Barracks stores. The closest one to Boston is in Saugus. <br>They have helmets for $20, knee pads and elbow pads for $15-$20 a pair, and protection goggles for $10 and up. The one I saw in Saugus actually had an anti riot shield for sale.<br> For other New England bros coming they have other locations too, also check out other army surplus stores; they should have similar products.","time":1492744338,"resto":122068187,"id":"a8ovB9cS","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122087524,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)23:12:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122087072\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122087072<\/a><br>could be the OP isnt aware of mass laws","time":1492744354,"resto":122068187,"id":"EEDF2y6R","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122087552,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)23:12:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122087479\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122087479<\/a><br>yep","filename":"berkeleyfight","ext":".webm","w":1280,"h":720,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1492744370827,"time":1492744370,"md5":"YV7nXEj\/tsa+9+bdWhdVYA==","fsize":1402184,"resto":122068187,"id":"sXXF62Ww","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}]}

My parents explained what was happening in a way that I could understand at such a young age. He not only covered the Watergate break-in, but through masterful investigative journalism was a key figure in exposing it. It was like a combination of truth-finding detective work mixed with socially transformative storytelling to further the causes of justice and honesty. This would define who I was as a person, for the rest of my life I would seek to honor and fulfill the values he had shown me as a young boy.<br><br>I would be successful. Though sometimes failing to measure up to his level of mastery, I always sought to improve my work, to bring honest news to the American people. I also noticed that in the preventative side of Carl Senpai&#039;s work he was no less masterful, cultivating an image that was a mix of hardened, resolved academic muster and grandfatherly warmth. You wanted to trust him just by looking at him, and he wanted you to make him earn that trust. Just as he had inspired a big part of my career, I decided to pay him an homage by adopting some of the traits of his persona, even fancying that he would notice this tip of the hat and approve. I certainly wouldn&#039;t have minded anyone else noticing my honorific imitation.<br><br>But then something magical happened, the perfect night and the perfect moment. In the middle of breaking the key part of this generation&#039;s Watergate, a story on intelligence issue suggesting coordination between Trump associations and Russians, I had Carl Senpai on as a guest. We were both wearing our signature glasses. In the middle of our discussion he looked at me in the eye through the camera and gave this proud smile. He knew. Having been a parental figure before, he was now like a brother to me. We were peers.","filename":"senpai","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":281,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1490277218666,"time":1490277218,"md5":"v1+Ub\/6kVUJoxLYNrp54kg==","fsize":91182,"resto":0,"id":"Hfs7BDxb","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"memories-of-72","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0},{"no":117933367,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)09:58:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117932853\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117932853<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;(Berstein)<\/span>","time":1490277507,"resto":117932853,"id":"IT1oZwUL","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":117931257,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)09:39:07","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Greekfag here","com":"Ask me anything.","filename":"flag","ext":".jpg","w":1920,"h":1080,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1490276347047,"time":1490276347,"md5":"sJcfIKxS5O+mFgDs4O4iwA==","fsize":51814,"resto":0,"id":"SzBD3WVk","country":"GR","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"greekfag-here","country_name":"Greece","replies":15,"images":2,"omitted_posts":10,"omitted_images":2},{"no":117932439,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)09:49:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"Full Brit who grew up between ages 6-17 in Greece, this is my perspective:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Politicians are corrupt and black market economy=&gt;what&#039;s on books<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Greece has historically been a debt slave since the industrialization era of Kapodistrias<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Greece has one of highest suicide rates in Europe due to (((Austerity)))<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Pardon the faggotry, but not all Greeks are lying scheming faggots who enjoy siestas too much and are lazy\/inadequate\/non-productive<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Greece is gorgeous, as long as you have islands for the money<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I grew up in the north of the island of Corfu, where the Rothschilds have their villas and established the &#039;&#039;friendly company\/Masonic Order of the Phoenix that liberated Greece from the Ottomans to be our proxy resource mining centre<\/span>","filename":"reee","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":637,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":124,"tim":1490276976675,"time":1490276976,"md5":"p+dYqUHQ\/CeFT2a0VNXfyQ==","fsize":65864,"resto":117931257,"id":"giaK10Xv","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":117932492,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)09:50:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117931744\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117931744<\/a><br>I don&#039;t know, most of the time they happen earlier than the 4 years.

Honestly if you wanted to create a class of feral subhumans, the inner cities in America are probably the best way to do it:<br><br>1) No fathers<br>2) Shitty diets, lots of corn and corn derived products<br>3) Retarded nigger culture from (((Hollywood)))<br>4) No actual opportunities, hence crime, hence getting shot hence point 1<br><br>I mean obviously HBD exists but black countries that have managed to keep civilization running usually are nice places to visit. It seems like the perquisites for a functional black society are:<br><br>1) Only black people. If you have poo in loos or whites their differential success will cause resentment.<br>2) No \/ minimal nigger culture - TV \/ radio in Caribbean countries is mostly from South America which has some Catholic influences on its major broadcasters to keep the degeneracy down. Internet will ruin this though.<br>3) No abortions. Condoms are probably a good thing, and the pill is very expensive. Encourages marriage.<br>4) Christianity or Islam. Obviously Christianity is better b\/c there are less hard and fast laws and more general principles - this means that there can be more local influence into the religion which makes people like it more. <br>5) The main thing is marriage. You can have a civilization with 85 IQ people, as plenty of East African and Caribbean countries demonstrate, as long as female hypergamy and male competition for harems is constrained. You can&#039;t have a lasting civilization even with smart people if you let people&#039;s base nature take over. In rich high IQ countries it might look more like well, the current year rather than just niggers being niggers but the consequences are the same.<br>6) I think tropical latitudes are important because of sunlight, lack of extreme seasonal differences and good temperatures.","time":1491751627,"resto":120289576,"id":"oWX\/OW5g","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120293581,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)11:28:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120289794\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120289794<\/a><br>ahahaha it&#039;s about school cheating not relationship\/sex cheating","time":1491751684,"resto":120289576,"id":"k+Ha7wc9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120293612,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)11:28:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120289576\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120289576<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;in my country Cheating is considered equivalent to rape and murder ( no one does that)<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;rape and murder ( no one does that)<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;India<\/span>","filename":"wat (10)","ext":".gif","w":245,"h":276,"tn_w":110,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491751703679,"time":1491751703,"md5":"b6JgxoFCf3LvJFoB51JJsg==","fsize":1995601,"resto":120289576,"id":"4XDRjVRS","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"}]},{"posts":[{"no":120292185,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)11:14:56","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Europe","com":"ITT Best countries in Europe in 2017<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Poland<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Austria<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Switzerland<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Czech Republic<\/span><br>Are the germans or the british still in this list?","filename":"Europe_flags","ext":".png","w":1200,"h":996,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":207,"tim":1491750896403,"time":1491750896,"md5":"9umpJ\/AuyuRqhqN968lt5A==","fsize":95893,"resto":0,"id":"d0jwwhNe","country":"RO","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"europe","country_name":"Romania","replies":20,"images":3,"omitted_posts":15,"omitted_images":2},{"no":120293360,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)11:25:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120293087\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120293087<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;latvia<\/span><br>they are the shit patty between two mediocre buns","time":1491751555,"resto":120292185,"id":"RE2ULwts","country":"EE","country_name":"Estonia"},{"no":120293400,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)11:26:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120292185\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120292185<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Poland<\/span><br><br>Explain why so many Poles move to western Europe","time":1491751576,"resto":120292185,"id":"RLErOHpY","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":120293469,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)11:26:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120293087\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120293087<\/a><br>Not hearing about them in the news<br>Close to Germany -&gt;

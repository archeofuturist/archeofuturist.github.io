I&#039;m transgender, identify as female, so yes, obviously many of these men are still attracted to the female form. But that doesn&#039;t change the fact that they&#039;re in the gay club, around dozens of gay men, who are all eyeing these guys and wondering if they want to get bent over in the bathroom, yet they don&#039;t want to be caught dead around gay men in public.<br><br>The problem is that you can&#039;t do anything with a conservative guy. He wants to be secretive. It&#039;s just a big thrill for them. They want a fuck and then run away back to their safe space with their red-cap wearing buddies and go mudding on the weekend or some redneck shit. No conservative man will take me on a date. But that doesn&#039;t stop them from calling me on Friday and Saturday night wanting to know if I want to &quot;hook up again&quot;, to which I tell most of them no.<br><br>Then there&#039;s the married men. I&#039;d say a quarter of all the conservative men are married. They won&#039;t tell you, they *usually* hide their rings. Some don&#039;t. Usually ones who won&#039;t hide their rings are the ones who want *you* to fuck *them*, which I sometimes oblige if the mood strikes me despite the moral disparity involved.<br><br>If so many conservative men are going to engage in gay behavior but openly act homophobic then there&#039;s something fundamentally wrong in the conservative psyche that needs to be addressed.","filename":"1490499792722","ext":".png","w":2176,"h":1856,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":213,"tim":1490750549463,"time":1490750549,"md5":"EHDFbub311eVDbQIbhVNBw==","fsize":1231763,"resto":0,"id":"exgufP5q","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"we-need-to-do-something-about-the-gay-image","country_name":"United States","replies":71,"images":13,"omitted_posts":66,"omitted_images":13},{"no":118740499,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)23:25:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118740158\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118740158<\/a><br>Moving would be optimal but that&#039;s not happening anytime soon.<br><br>Identifying as transgender on a dating site just puts a target on you for hateful and sick people.

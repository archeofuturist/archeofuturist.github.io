The point is that it&#039;s unforgivable. Short version: what is required for forgiveness to occur? Repentance on the part of the offender and a willingness on the part of the offended to let it go. Without that willingness to repent (usually articulated as in some fully-informed state as has been mentioned), whatever God might do wouldn&#039;t qualify as forgiveness.

That almost every media outlet is part of a propaganda bubble that envelops our entire society. Through following this board, I&#039;ve had the opportunity to step outside that, and follow events the MSM doesn&#039;t cover. Then when they finally jump in and cover it, I can immediately see the lies and bullshit for what they are. Take the Syrian war generals for a perfect example of this. We have anons following daily events in minute detail. We have reports from people on the ground. We know exactly what&#039;s happening at any given time. When the media steps in with their narrative, the lies are not only transparent, they&#039;re lazy and so inconsistent a child could pick them apart.<br>And it&#039;s like that with nearly everything in the news, politics, international relations. The narrative is almost 100% absolute horseshit, and places like this are one of the only ways of breaking out of it.","time":1491786793,"resto":120363925,"id":"qZT\/9Z4s","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"},{"no":120369010,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)21:13:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120366578\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120366578<\/a><br>Nationalities is the one that gets me.<br><br>It&#039;s so tiring when threads just devolve into americans\/Europeans\/Canadians\/aus\/N<wbr>Z bickering over which country is more cucked<br><br>Divide any conquer works on\/pop\/ like a charm and stops anything from happening","time":1491786807,"resto":120363925,"id":"x3geOpAi","country":"NZ","country_name":"New Zealand"},{"no":120369018,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)21:13:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120363925\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120363925<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;leafs<\/span>","time":1491786809,"resto":120363925,"id":"QIrvvvdb","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":120349345,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)18:37:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"Thoughts on PJW Flip flopping?","filename":"1491752568148","ext":".jpg","w":1240,"h":620,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":124,"tim":1491777436104,"time":1491777436,"md5":"ez3qfPGCyzWZIciFqMxnLg==","fsize":85588,"resto":0,"id":"wRRA3lA7","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"thoughts-on-pjw-flip-flopping","country_name":"United States","replies":60,"images":12,"omitted_posts":55,"omitted_images":11},{"no":120366617,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)20:53:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120350672\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120350672<\/a><br>even the UN report did not explicitly attribute blame to Syria<br><br>it is unknowable at this point who perpetrated the gas attack. we just happen to know that it would be a stupid move for Assad because he was winning the war anyway and gas was the &quot;red line&quot; Obama set.<br><br>Trump is doing this for other reasons, mostly related to controlling narrative back home.

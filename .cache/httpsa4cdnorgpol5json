I felt kind of sick after eating it and biting on chunks of fat made me gag and my stomach turn. For about 5 years I went full vegetarian. Even smelling meat was hard and disgusting. <br><br>It changed when I was invited to a celebration feast for a completed apprenticeship. We&#039;ve been about 20 guys an a big table with pretty much anything from salat to fish to meat and bread, in a nice restaurant. <br><br>Of course I started with salat and vegetables, but everything was so awsome and tasty, more tasty than anything I&#039;ve eaten before in my life. I enjoyed it so much, I had to try everything on the table including the various meat dishes. Not only it was so good I felt like crying, only a few minutes later a unique satisfying wave of warmth filled every cell in my body. Only then I understood my body desired this for a very long time and I selfishly denied it. Nothing can compare to giving your body what it truly wants and needs.<br><br>Days after that meal I felt like a changed person. I could think better and was full of energy. My face had a healthy color and smelled better. <br><br>No matter what anyone says, you cannot replace meat in your diet. Soja Product and various other Products to get the Proteins? It&#039;s all a lie.<br><br>Don&#039;t buy cheap shit from a discouter. Nothing can compare to quality meat and a cook who knows what he&#039;s doing. Never looked back to the vegetarian life, I only regret beeing so dumb for many years and miss out on good food.<br><br>Also, many politically correct people seem to be vegetarians and vegans thus making eating meat politically incorrect for some reason. Proof, the following posts made by SJW calling me an inhuman moster and showing cute animals while asking &quot;How can you hurt this cute animal!?&quot;<br><br>Thanks for reading my blog.","filename":"Meat","ext":".jpg","w":969,"h":545,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1490167107792,"time":1490167107,"md5":"FvKpNS49rQPNOJsJN\/thIg==","fsize":242930,"resto":0,"id":"4FYUBzlv","country":"DE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"as-teenager-i-stopped-eating-meat-i-felt-kind-of","country_name":"Germany","replies":14,"images":2,"omitted_posts":9,"omitted_images":1},{"no":117737035,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)04:01:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117734152\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117734152<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;kraut being a total fucking pussy bitch<\/span><br>Not surprised, losing ww2 and getting gang raped by Russia really fucked you up.","time":1490169705,"resto":117734152,"id":"s5H33x8b","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117737231,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)04:04:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117736723\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117736723<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Real alfa men are carnivorus motherfuckers<\/span><br><br>t. fragile masculinity","time":1490169889,"resto":117734152,"id":"TwsdIjiR","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":117737510,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)04:09:43","name":"Myosotis","com":"<a href=\"#p117734152\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117734152<\/a><br>Hitler lost because he didn&#039;t had a good steak at this day","filename":"fms","ext":".jpg","w":540,"h":534,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":123,"tim":1490170183685,"time":1490170183,"md5":"zenwHaM\/kPKg8jj5h6pC+g==","fsize":68648,"resto":117734152,"id":"xGW91bDb","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":117737532,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)04:10:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117734152\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117734152<\/a><br>Good for you.<br><br><br>Still dont eat bread, dairy and refined sugars, they are literally the CANCER of our society ans should be avoided at all cost.<br><br>Veganism has nothing to do with libtards or SJW, it&#039;s a healthy detoxification process of liver and guts, meat is not bad per se but requires a lot of effort to be diggested","time":1490170208,"resto":117734152,"id":"FTPeTWvJ","country":"MX","country_name":"Mexico"},{"no":117737649,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)04:11:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"yeah I get vegetarianism but they really are just trying to fool themselves.

In nature, what we call &quot;homosexual behavior&quot; is only a tendency in communities with high male populations, and even then its merely bisexual behavior. Once male horniness reaches a peak they don&#039;t care what they fuck. Once you have several generations of men convinced they are &quot;women trapped in men&#039;s bodies&quot;, the crossdreser\/tranny is the next step in that long line of degeneration. Jews then weaponized the trannies by making them popular to make women even more degenerate than they ever were to begin with. What better way to know what a man finds sexual than to convince a man to think he&#039;s a woman and dress the part? Once women saw it, their competition to attract instinct kicked in and we&#039;ve been on a downward spiral ever since. Jews and the media softened boomers and their offspring up to the idea of &quot;men in drag&quot; on tv and in cartoons.

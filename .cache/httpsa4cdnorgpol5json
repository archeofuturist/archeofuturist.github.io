Christ, it&#039;s not like I hate the Jews like half of the people here seem to do, but I&#039;m goddamn tired of this narrative because it&#039;s simply not true. Many similar genocides happened during that time, and the Holocaust very clearly WASN&#039;T &quot;the most organized genocide in history&quot; because they only came up with it years after they started deporting Jews. It boggles my fucking mind how the term &quot;Final Solution&quot; is so commonly used, yet no-one sees it in the obvious context of the problem having to have existed for a while before a &quot;Final Solution&quot; is even considered. If it were the plan from the start, they wouldn&#039;t have needed to come up with a final solution, now would they? I think the Holocaust narrative is harmful. It provides ammunition for the unironically racist, anti-Western\/white leftist argument that we need to feel guilty. Because it was exceptional, and we somehow all carry heriditary guilt.<br><br>My parents are Jew and Israel fetishists. While I support Israel&#039;s right to exist (even more so because the left and islam get so insanely asspained by of it) and I treat Judaism exactly the same as I treat other religions (no special rights, no exceptions, no state funding) it does irk me, just as much as it irks me when leftists go on and on about some non-Western country being better. In modern society there is no reason to worship a foreign people, but not move to that country. And as such I have limited tolerance for the worship of foreign cultures, not because I hate them, but because I love my own country and culture, and anyone who doesn&#039;t isn&#039;t actually being forced to stay here.","time":1492512816,"resto":121657415,"id":"WuNK3t6O","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":121669909,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)06:54:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121668450\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121668450<\/a><br>Honestly what type of mental shit are you on.

If it is not reasonable to suppose the Jews who did die from the remaining 1 millionish were dead due to supply shortages and typhus rather then mass executions of a people the nazis were purposefully trying to keep alive by not dying from tryphus by spending the energy on delousing their clothing and buzzing their hair and wasting many of the other resources why would they then afterwords kill them?

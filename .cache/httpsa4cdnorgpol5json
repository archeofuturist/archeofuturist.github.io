The part played by the <br>Press is to keep pointing our requirements supposed to be indispensable, to give voice <br>to the complaints of the people, to express and to create discontent. It is in the Press <br>that the triumph of freedom of speech finds its incarnation. But the GOYIM States <br>have not known how to make use of this force; and it has fallen into our hands. <br>Through the Press we have gained the power to influence while remaining ourselves in <br>the shade; thanks to the Press we have got the GOLD in our hands, notwithstanding <br>that we have had to gather it out of the oceans of blood and tears. But it has paid us, <br>though we have sacrificed many of our people. Each victim on our side is worth in the <br>sight of God a thousand GOYIM.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;T.

I prefer a woman who knows when it is appropriate to get all done up but who is equally comfortable with herself when she puts her hair in a pony tail, throws on a pair of sweatpants, and still feels comfortable in her own skin. If some chick is comfortable with herself unshaven, and some guy finds that sexy and attractive, they are symbiotic and I&#039;m completely fine with happy people.","filename":"rachel_bilson_1491448979066","ext":".jpg","w":1960,"h":3008,"tn_w":81,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491501826827,"time":1491501826,"md5":"clVBMWreXMzZRT421YRN4A==","fsize":637621,"resto":119757829,"id":"9DV0c0Xs","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":119770960,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)14:05:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"Scratch an unshaved woman, and you&#039;ll find a woman who hates bearded men.","time":1491501944,"resto":119757829,"id":"KoKPEk\/3","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119772221,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)14:16:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119757829\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119757829<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Shitting and pissing on the ground is also natural.

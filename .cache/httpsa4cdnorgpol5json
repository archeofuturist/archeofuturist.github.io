Even Einstein&#039;s theories and equations aren&#039;t completely correct, but we still teach Newtonian physics because they&#039;re true enough for the average person. Likewise science technically runs on assumptions that can&#039;t be made according to logic, since no matter how much something happened one way in the past, it could always happen differently in the future. Nevertheless, the process works far better than what we had before, so it&#039;s good enough.","time":1490113532,"resto":117628115,"id":"ZSomg1PN","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117640079,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)12:25:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"this is a simple philosophical assertion you degenerate philistines","filename":"1486527844117","ext":".jpg","w":297,"h":350,"tn_w":106,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490113556734,"time":1490113556,"md5":"Y+Fv+qIHsIO+gIKqKSfBpA==","fsize":19601,"resto":117628115,"id":"mGfZI1cs","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"},{"no":117640270,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)12:27:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117639443\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117639443<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;modern scientistic attitude - we&#039;ve explained everything <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;nothing special about life<\/span><br>Life is special in many ways.

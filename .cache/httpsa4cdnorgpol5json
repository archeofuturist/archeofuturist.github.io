Civic Nationalism works, and it works well, but one must not that some &quot;violent&quot; things are necessary. Like a group like the stormtroopers in Nazi germany. Basically they need to serve as a protection force, not and offensive one. However they still must be there. Above all else order and aethstics in regards to these warriors is important. In regards to more civic ideas yes it is completely compatible, read Mussolini, Mosley, work on this matter since both dealt with multi-ethnic nations. <br>https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Essays-Fasci<wbr>sm-Classic-Library-Mussolini\/dp\/191<wbr>0881023<br><br>but to give you a tldr answer, in order for Civic nationalism to work in a multi-ethnic state you must create a unified identity somehow, through religion, culture, and an idea of patriotism. If my knowledge on brazil is correct then like america, most of the people have multiple ethnicity and &quot;purebloods&quot; are amongst the minority. Even if this isnt the case look at how america has assimilated people in the past, through that you will find some more insight. It doesn&#039;t really matter what you believe in regards to religion, all thats important is you recognize its ability to unify different tribes of people especially with Christianity, and I assume you want to emulate Western Civ, so thats what I would do.","filename":"id invade that","ext":".png","w":157,"h":162,"tn_w":121,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493099045735,"time":1493099045,"md5":"M0LTf5rtwDtYc13rgwUTlg==","fsize":52679,"resto":122687339,"id":"AVLS1MDN","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122699932,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)01:50:19","name":"The Sage King","com":"<a href=\"#p122698431\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122698431<\/a><br>Brother believe me I too want to go and bash their faces in, what true man wouldn&#039;t! however we must think of the bigger picture. If you do go I wouldnt display any NatSoc anything, otherwise it hurts us. Also yes it probably would lead to some sort of trap if you asked randies online. What you ought to do is start to foster similar sentiments amongst your friends or those who would sympathies with NatSoc. You cant be overly aggressive you need to be diplomatic about it. once you have a group of Brothers who will back you that you know and trust would be the only time I would ever think it would be safe and smart to do. You pin pointed the idea when you brought up Yukio Mishima. basically we need to uphold a chivalric code to an extant when it comes to combat.

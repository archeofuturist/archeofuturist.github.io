Show your girlfriend that&#039;s your competent financially, that you can make the dough together so it won&#039;t be a problem in the future. To be honest though, 4 is unrealistic. 2 yes, but 4? You sure you and your wife can save up for all 4 of them without going into debt? My bro has a 3rd child (he has no self control - even had to abort his first child with current wife bcuz relationship was unstable) and he ALOT of debt. Was paying $400 in interest until his wife found out and flipped. I recommend for you to reconsider 4.

But around 11th grade I became good looking all of a sudden, got a better hairstyle, and dressed better<\/span><br><br>So what I&#039;m basically asking is, should I go to prom without a date? My nerdy friends are going without dates (obviously) and they want me to go. Will it still be fun to go with just friends? Should I just ask out a girl?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;also, what were your experiences at prom, did u have a date?<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;is there any chance of me going to prom alone, and hooking up with a girl there? I&#039;m trying to lose my virginity guys!!!!<\/span>","filename":"16-reasons-you-should-go-to-prom-without-a-date-2-16727-1428692280-34_dblbig","ext":".jpg","w":625,"h":415,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1493579526974,"time":1493579526,"md5":"pxv2XWsOWvjDCqYAXL+T6w==","fsize":45744,"resto":0,"id":"evH0kkYf","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"should-i-go-to-prom-alone","country_name":"United States","replies":7,"images":1,"unique_ips":7},{"no":123512824,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)15:17:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"Listen.

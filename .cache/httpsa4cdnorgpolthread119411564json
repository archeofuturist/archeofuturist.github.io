Without the support of an initiatic chain, you run the risk of accessing the subconscious rather than the superconscious dimension. A great risk involved here is that you &quot;tear down&quot; the &quot;wall&quot; which divides your conscious being from the subconscious, opening the door to all sorts of subtle influences and suggestions, many of a nefarious nature.

Even remote useless land in my state (no access, sharp hills, covered in trees and brush) is 1000 an acre. Nothing under 10 acres stays that price either. No matter the condition. So pretty much you need 30k+ to even buy decent land. No one lends that kind of money, especially on raw land. Other than that, i got the know how to build just about everything, from solar to water pumping. Hell you can spend very little on the whole thing if you have some year round running water for god tier hydro. You can also supplement with a gas engine run on wood gas. A generator or a DC alternator generator. Starting out power wise can be very cheap. Building up a large solar system is easy. Just go 24 volts to start and buy cheap golf cart batteries. Buy up solar panels until the batteries are at max charge than set them aside. A cheap basic pwm controller goes for 60-90 bucks for a decent model or you can spend 120 ish for a good 60 amp model. 30 amps should handle about 800 watts, 60 amps, 1600. Upgrade the system later with the battery bank of choice and down cycle the current batteries to smaller system or lighting or just to run a specific refrigerator.<br>The actual house I would pour concrete pears and build a pole barn with a simple apartment in the back.","time":1490842095,"resto":118853371,"id":"o3DXjGSZ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118871998,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)22:50:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118871227\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118871227<\/a><br>Depends on what state and what county.

I considered doing this but with an upright freezer. A chest freezer running as a fridge uses 100-150 watts a day. However, they get moldy and wet easy and you still need to run it on an inverter. Inverters are typically 85% efficient at peak and as low as 50% efficient at lower levels. You need a larger inverter to start the motor but it might only draw 100 watts. That is likely to put it on the less efficient part of its curve plus the self draw of the inverter. A 1500 watt inverter would run the freezer, but you would have to be careful not to be running appliances when it kicks on or the inverter will over load and shut off. 1500 watt inverters typically run 12 watts of self draw. So that 100 watts of motor is now 125 from waste heat plus 24\/7 inverter self draw. That 150 watt load is now 400-500. They do make chest DC freezers with variable thermostats that use even less. <br>Root cellars are awesome but don&#039;t reach cold enough temps unless you live farther north. You can use a DC dometic DIY refrigeration kit to make your own walk in cooler though. Insulation is key. You can also use to to make a freezer or fridge. Runs about 700 bucks but you can make a SUPER efficient refrigerator with crazy insulation. A 8 x 10 room could use less than 400 watts a day if its buried and kept at 38 degrees with 12 inches of insulation.","time":1490843879,"resto":118853371,"id":"o3DXjGSZ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118874906,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)23:18:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118874525\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118874525<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;buying expensive plumbing systems built from an inefficient globalist system to serve the purpose of a simple latrine<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;600 acres<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;no streams to dam up for electricity<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;maintenance are killers<\/span><br>what else would you do with your time desu? you&#039;re not wagecucking so thats a shitton of free time<br><br>internet is where i&#039;d draw the line, just for the reason i&#039;m not 100% motivated by the purist idea","time":1490843887,"resto":118853371,"id":"H98ZsB45","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118874991,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)23:18:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118874508\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118874508<\/a><br>Which takes more panels and larger batteries to run.

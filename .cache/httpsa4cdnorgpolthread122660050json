Too bad the world is going to be completely flooded within a decade as a result of the climate warming a few degrees even though it hasn&#039;t gotten warmer at all in the past 15 years. Despite knowing this is going to happen with 100% certainly (97% percent of all scientists agree after all) I&#039;m not going to sell my Florida residence and move in-land. In fact I&#039;m not going to change anything about my life. I&#039;m just going to keep saying that disastrous anthropogenic climate change is occurring but I&#039;m not going to live like I really believe that because that would just be too inconvenient. Now excuse me, I need to go buy some non-GMO bread because that&#039;s a thing.","time":1493080099,"resto":122660050,"id":"5B5C+YMF","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122664040,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)20:31:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122663632\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122663632<\/a><br>Global warming prevented us from experiencing the cool grapeless perfection of the 1750s!!!

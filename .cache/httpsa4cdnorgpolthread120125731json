They are easy to spot, piece of shit, cancer. They don&#039;t get any of the humor, can&#039;t discern irony from sincerity and are easily hurt when they&#039;re favorite TV,internet figureheads are attacked. All they can do is reply with FAKE NEWS or sad! and try to &quot;btfo anti trump shills&quot; by copying his retarded tweet style that was done as joke and taken literally (which these retards probably think is a legitimate compliment to trump and a copy his style of tweet replies as a form of endearment). Trump fucked up and betrayed his base. And look at all the butthurt t_D posters who immediately started posting threads in all caps with the images of people like Sam and everyone else they watched and worshipped, getting all angry and resentful towards anybody who isn&#039;t blindly sucking Trumps cock and instead criticize those engaging in critical thinking.

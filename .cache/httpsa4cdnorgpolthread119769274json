The fundamental axiom is that of a struggle between an unambiguous good and an unambiguous evil. Within their belief systems there is an unambiguous ethic passed down to them from a higher power. This ethic dictates right and wrong for the follower and leaves no room for independent ethical reservations. Since this system is by definition good, everything that lies outside of it is evil and must be attacked. Furthermore they believe that the natural state of the world is good. If anything bad ever happens then it must be the result of the conscious action of a malicious force. Keeping along with that same line of reasoning reveals a telling statement about human agency. The statement being that people are automata. And that they behave in very predictable ways when left to their own devices. The leftist leader thinks of themselves as a sort of shepherd. If the shepherd wasn&#039;t there the sheep would fall prey to wolves. Were there no wolves the sheep would leave in peace among eachother. In the presence of a malicious force the leftist leader, seeing themselves as being above and beyond the common man, takes it upon themselves to curtail the free action of his livestock, to prevent them from coming to a ruinous end at the hands of some great devil.

If there is a problem it is never incidental to the nature of the subject matter. It is consciously being caused by some wicked force. And if that wicked force were only weeded out there would be harmony. They see the chosen force, be it the rich or the banks or whatever, as a pure devil rather than human beings. They decry the utility and humanity of their chosen antagonist, and do everything in the name of a crusade against this enemy. Ironically, the stated goals are almost always in conflict with the actions of such groups. But since they see themselves as an unequivocal good, they proceed as the crusader did, believing that their infallible god will cover their mistakes. Whenever they fail to achueve a goal they take it as evidence of an even greater evil behind the scenes, and resolve to replay the dualist drama on a larger scale against a different devil, lest they admit defeat and consequently the fallibility of their god. The pathological crusader mindset is actually aggravated by atheism rather than diminished by it. For a Christian falling in the holy land, there is Paradise as a reward. The only reward for materialist martyrdom is the satisfaction of any masochistic tendencies that may have been incidental to the ordeal. For mortal, failure is not an option. Death is a dead end. And giving up will leave them without purpose, a fate worse than death. The only option is to continue the fight even if there&#039;s no hope of victory. Because victory was never the goal in the first place.(cont)","filename":"dems_then_and_now[1]","ext":".jpg","w":326,"h":339,"tn_w":120,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491502738941,"time":1491502738,"md5":"p4LbZOaklTYms+fuqAo\/sQ==","fsize":41969,"resto":119769274,"id":"l0EHbRyo","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119773308,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)14:25:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119769274\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119769274<\/a><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=W8N<wbr>3FF_3KvU&amp;list=PLMNj_r5bccUw40CpD-JY<wbr>XJyVsDYsj7ITD","time":1491503144,"resto":119769274,"id":"iVvLV1dB","country":"IN","country_name":"India"},{"no":119773963,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)14:30:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119769274\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119769274<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Another fact I&#039;ve realized is the consistency of historical &quot;left&quot; revolutions, most revolutions are by nature left-formed. <\/span><br><br>I am not sure about that one.

However, a utopia can only instilled and maintained by methoods that most utopians disaprove of. The freedom fighter is rather the pathological revolutionary. These are the people for whom the goal and the struggle are both rebelion. After most successful revolutions, for instance in the soviet union and Cuba, you will see a purging of supporters that helped the current regime cpme to power. This no accident, nor is it coincidence. The pathological revolutionary is not ideaological, although they may believe that they are. To them, order itself is the enemy. It would be no sooner than the success of a communist revolution, that the same revolutionaries woukd be claiming that this new order is not true communism and must be dismantled. For them, victory is transitory. There must be constant revolution in order to satisfy them. It&#039;s how they draw meaning from a sterile and mechanical world. The combination of utopians, such as Karl Marx, revolutionaries, such as Trotsky, and authoritarian planners, such as Stalin, is what makes up the body of all leftisim and authoritarianism in general. A utopian tells the masses that everything would be perfect, if only some small wrong were righted. This spurs the revolutionaries to action and tempts the ordinary man to tolerance. Once the revolutionaries have succeeded, the planners purge them, and either attempt to exploit the consolidation of power, or sincerely believe that they are above their fellow men in terms of humanity. No matter which, the result is the same.","filename":"1489066696967","ext":".png","w":793,"h":794,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":124,"tim":1491503852394,"time":1491503852,"md5":"tBX7VAF6vFkF7jv6fZewCw==","fsize":279138,"resto":119769274,"id":"l0EHbRyo","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119775228,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)14:40:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119769274\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119769274<\/a><br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Doubl<wbr>ethink","time":1491504044,"resto":119769274,"id":"DYQY6jl3","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":119776066,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)14:46:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119769757\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119769757<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;left<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;diplomacy; pacifism<\/span><br>topkek","time":1491504418,"resto":119769274,"id":"XJZzwT1A","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119776939,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)14:53:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119774813\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119774813<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;falsely calls marx an utopian<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;is unironically an ancap<\/span>","time":1491504816,"resto":119769274,"id":"4kVxIxkc","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":119777254,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)14:55:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119774813\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119774813<\/a><br>Where are the roads nigger?","time":1491504959,"resto":119769274,"id":"9Z3A8P1K","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":119777274,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)14:56:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119776939\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119776939<\/a><br>Im not ancap.

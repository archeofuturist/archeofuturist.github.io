The fundamental axiom is that of a struggle between an unambiguous good and an unambiguous evil. Within their belief systems there is an unambiguous ethic passed down to them from a higher power. This ethic dictates right and wrong for the follower and leaves no room for independent ethical reservations. Since this system is by definition good, everything that lies outside of it is evil and must be attacked. Furthermore they believe that the natural state of the world is good. If anything bad ever happens then it must be the result of the conscious action of a malicious force. Keeping along with that same line of reasoning reveals a telling statement about human agency. The statement being that people are automata. And that they behave in very predictable ways when left to their own devices. The leftist leader thinks of themselves as a sort of shepherd. If the shepherd wasn&#039;t there the sheep would fall prey to wolves. Were there no wolves the sheep would leave in peace among eachother. In the presence of a malicious force the leftist leader, seeing themselves as being above and beyond the common man, takes it upon themselves to curtail the free action of his livestock, to prevent them from coming to a ruinous end at the hands of some great devil.

If there is a problem it is never incidental to the nature of the subject matter. It is consciously being caused by some wicked force. And if that wicked force were only weeded out there would be harmony. They see the chosen force, be it the rich or the banks or whatever, as a pure devil rather than human beings. They decry the utility and humanity of their chosen antagonist, and do everything in the name of a crusade against this enemy. Ironically, the stated goals are almost always in conflict with the actions of such groups. But since they see themselves as an unequivocal good, they proceed as the crusader did, believing that their infallible god will cover their mistakes. Whenever they fail to achueve a goal they take it as evidence of an even greater evil behind the scenes, and resolve to replay the dualist drama on a larger scale against a different devil, lest they admit defeat and consequently the fallibility of their god. The pathological crusader mindset is actually aggravated by atheism rather than diminished by it. For a Christian falling in the holy land, there is Paradise as a reward. The only reward for materialist martyrdom is the satisfaction of any masochistic tendencies that may have been incidental to the ordeal. For mortal, failure is not an option. Death is a dead end. And giving up will leave them without purpose, a fate worse than death. The only option is to continue the fight even if there&#039;s no hope of victory. Because victory was never the goal in the first place.(cont)","filename":"dems_then_and_now[1]","ext":".jpg","w":326,"h":339,"tn_w":120,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491502738941,"time":1491502738,"md5":"p4LbZOaklTYms+fuqAo\/sQ==","fsize":41969,"resto":119769274,"id":"l0EHbRyo","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119773308,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)14:25:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119769274\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119769274<\/a><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=W8N<wbr>3FF_3KvU&amp;list=PLMNj_r5bccUw40CpD-JY<wbr>XJyVsDYsj7ITD","time":1491503144,"resto":119769274,"id":"iVvLV1dB","country":"IN","country_name":"India"}]}

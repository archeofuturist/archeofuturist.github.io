Atheism is in decline worldwide, with the number of atheists falling from 4.5% of the world&#039;s population in 1970 to 2.0% in 2010 and projected to drop to 1.8% by 2020, <br><br>Real surveys and statistics say atheism is on the decline worldwide. Sorry atheists but atheism is not on the rise nor is it winning. It&#039;s still the minority and a declining one at that. <br><br>The Pew Research Center&#039;s statistics show that atheism is expected to continue to decline all the way into 2050 with a continued growth of religion. Other research also shows a huge surge in growth for Christianity in China which is currently the world&#039;s most &quot;atheist&quot; nation because of the atheist communist government suppressing religion, the research suggests that China will soon become the world&#039;s most Christian nation within 15 years. <br><br>This is simply history repeating itself: Christianity prospered in Rome back in the ancient era when it was suppressed and it still grew in the militant atheist soviet Russia when it was suppressed there only a century ago with the majority of Russians today now also identifying as Christian. Just goes to show that atheist suppression of religion still doesn&#039;t stop religion.<br><br>Sources for the legion of whiny \/Redditor\/ fedoras that will no doubt show up it this thread:<br><br>http:\/\/www.pewforum.org\/2015\/04\/02\/<wbr>religious-projections-2010-2050\/<br>http:\/\/www.pewforum.org\/2012\/12\/18\/<wbr>global-religious-landscape-unaffili<wbr>ated\/<br>http:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/news\/wor<wbr>ldnews\/asia\/china\/10776023\/China-on<wbr>-course-to-become-worlds-most-Chris<wbr>tian-nation-within-15-years.html<br>http:\/\/masterrussian.com\/russia\/fac<wbr>ts.htm","filename":"1490142549767","ext":".jpg","w":608,"h":755,"tn_w":201,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492341120688,"time":1492341120,"md5":"gbLQR\/M\/TdWWLU+dYjIA+Q==","fsize":123410,"resto":0,"id":"lCJEXadL","country":"PL","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"atheism-is-the-fastest-shrinking-religion-in-the","country_name":"Poland","replies":96,"images":27,"unique_ips":42},{"no":121347881,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)07:13:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121347781\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121347781<\/a><br>okay","time":1492341201,"resto":121347781,"id":"ORfyC\/0I","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121348389,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)07:20:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121347781\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121347781<\/a><br>From your first source:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Atheists, agnostics and other people who do not affiliate with any religion \u2013 though increasing in countries such as the United States and France \u2013 will make up a declining share of the world\u2019s total population.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In the United States, Christians will decline from more than three-quarters of the population in 2010 to two-thirds in 2050, and Judaism will no longer be the largest non-Christian religion.

If that was real, there would be a way to reproduce it or detect it with the same level of development from 2000 years ago. However, there were no observed resurrections ever since, nor any observable side effects (such as e.g. high radioactivity) in the area where supposed resurrection occurred. Thus we can either a) accept it as true without evidence, but that would be very retarded way of reasoning or b) say that&#039;s at least improbable and await further proof. Since for 2000 years, there has been utter and complete failure at performing and observing resurrections with primitive technology level, I am inclined to go with it being bullshit.

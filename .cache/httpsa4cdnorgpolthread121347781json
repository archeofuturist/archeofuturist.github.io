Atheism is in decline worldwide, with the number of atheists falling from 4.5% of the world&#039;s population in 1970 to 2.0% in 2010 and projected to drop to 1.8% by 2020, <br><br>Real surveys and statistics say atheism is on the decline worldwide. Sorry atheists but atheism is not on the rise nor is it winning. It&#039;s still the minority and a declining one at that. <br><br>The Pew Research Center&#039;s statistics show that atheism is expected to continue to decline all the way into 2050 with a continued growth of religion. Other research also shows a huge surge in growth for Christianity in China which is currently the world&#039;s most &quot;atheist&quot; nation because of the atheist communist government suppressing religion, the research suggests that China will soon become the world&#039;s most Christian nation within 15 years. <br><br>This is simply history repeating itself: Christianity prospered in Rome back in the ancient era when it was suppressed and it still grew in the militant atheist soviet Russia when it was suppressed there only a century ago with the majority of Russians today now also identifying as Christian. Just goes to show that atheist suppression of religion still doesn&#039;t stop religion.<br><br>Sources for the legion of whiny \/Redditor\/ fedoras that will no doubt show up it this thread:<br><br>http:\/\/www.pewforum.org\/2015\/04\/02\/<wbr>religious-projections-2010-2050\/<br>http:\/\/www.pewforum.org\/2012\/12\/18\/<wbr>global-religious-landscape-unaffili<wbr>ated\/<br>http:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/news\/wor<wbr>ldnews\/asia\/china\/10776023\/China-on<wbr>-course-to-become-worlds-most-Chris<wbr>tian-nation-within-15-years.html<br>http:\/\/masterrussian.com\/russia\/fac<wbr>ts.htm","filename":"1490142549767","ext":".jpg","w":608,"h":755,"tn_w":201,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492341120688,"time":1492341120,"md5":"gbLQR\/M\/TdWWLU+dYjIA+Q==","fsize":123410,"resto":0,"id":"lCJEXadL","country":"PL","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"atheism-is-the-fastest-shrinking-religion-in-the","country_name":"Poland","replies":137,"images":41,"unique_ips":63,"tail_size":50},{"no":121347881,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)07:13:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121347781\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121347781<\/a><br>okay","time":1492341201,"resto":121347781,"id":"ORfyC\/0I","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121348389,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)07:20:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121347781\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121347781<\/a><br>From your first source:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Atheists, agnostics and other people who do not affiliate with any religion \u2013 though increasing in countries such as the United States and France \u2013 will make up a declining share of the world\u2019s total population.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In the United States, Christians will decline from more than three-quarters of the population in 2010 to two-thirds in 2050, and Judaism will no longer be the largest non-Christian religion.

Thus we can either a) accept it as true without evidence, but that would be very retarded way of reasoning or b) say that&#039;s at least improbable and await further proof. Since for 2000 years, there has been utter and complete failure at performing and observing resurrections with primitive technology level, I am inclined to go with it being bullshit.

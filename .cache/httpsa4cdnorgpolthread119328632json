Being &quot;liberal with spaces&quot; is a trait that is associated with being part of the out group, an easy identifier that you are NOT one of us. There are fundamental differences in the mindset of someone who uses Reddit and someone who uses 4chan, differences that manifest themselves in the ways listed in that picture which you obviously did not read. It is those differences that people care about. When you come here, and refuse to integrate, you are eroding, no destroying, the fifteen year old image board culture.<br><br>People who post on 4chan do not care about having a personal identity, while people on Reddit THRIVE on having a personal identity. On Reddit, anyone can instantly click on your profile and see a complete history of everything you have said. On 4chan, you are completely Anonymous unless you choose not to be, the fact that people despite given this option, choose anonymity, says a lot about what it is that 4channers value. When an identity is not tied to an idea, it allows that idea to be evaluated independent of who created that idea. It is not possible to independently evaluate an idea on Reddit. You have the identity of the person who has posted it, and a numeric representation of how it is the community feels about the idea. <br><br>The karma system discourages unpopular opinions from being expressed on Reddit. Popular opinions are more visible, and this encourages a very predictable hivemind mentality in every single subreddit that exists. This is why on \/r\/theDonald you cannot even begin to criticize Donald Trump, because the collective idea that was selected for was &quot;Donald Trump is good&quot; which was then amplified and transformed into &quot;Donald Trump is ALWAYS good&quot;.

Why is it that the majority of Reddit is liberal, while the majority of 4chan is conservative? Most people in general, particularly young people, are liberal. This means that on Reddit, whose primary user base is young people, liberal ideas are dominant. On 4chan, nobody cares what is or is not popular in terms of evaluating an argument. You claim that we &quot;can&#039;t hoard the truth&quot; but have you ever considered how it is we managed to discover that truth while you and the other Redditors have not? On 4chan it&#039;s possible to discover truth because it&#039;s possible to express an unpopular idea, and defend it on the basis of it being logical, which is NOT possible on Reddit. <br><br>Not only do you have to deal with the karma system, which is effectively user moderated censorship, you have to deal with the actual rules and moderators. If you express a sentiment on Reddit that is against the rules (most of which include things like no racism, trolling,etc) then your post is removed. The moderators themselves of course hold the same majority opinions that Redditors do, and use these very general rules to remove posts that they disagree with yet CANNOT argue against. You claim that you&#039;re able to use the echoes on Reddit, okay. Try actually making an argument suggesting that Jews are pushing for multiculturalism in the West, and you will be instantly banned for anti-semitism, even if you only include pure facts. <br><br>On 4chan you are free to express any opinion, no matter how racist, sexist, anti-semtic, transphobic, whatever. That allows the ideas that you consider &quot;truth&quot; to be discussed in the first place. Not at all possible on Reddit. Now the last point I have to make will be in the third post which ties it all together.","time":1491238509,"resto":119328632,"id":"KEquQeuf","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119349284,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)12:55:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119347593\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119347593<\/a><br>Ethno-national identity &gt; Internet identity.<br><br>Yes there are differences and the_donald does not arrive at the truth, but it is a stage to get to the truth, just as Trump himself is a step in the right direction, he&#039;s not the destination.<br><br>A lot of people here were liberal faggots at some point, but we grew out of it, just as the_donald can grow out of it.

You must be successful, reliable, hardworking, and, above all, happy. Do people in your life trust and respect you? What does your family think about you? Racial politics doesn&#039;t have to be the only factor of that. If you can&#039;t achieve these things in your real life, then you are not ready to be a political activist, either online or in real life. <br><br>Always remember: We live in first world countries, and have opportunity that most people born on this planet don&#039;t. Spend your time wisely and keep your real life priorities in order. Nothing on the internet should ever take away from your real life.","time":1491350618,"resto":119537365,"id":"XSs0Lk2w","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

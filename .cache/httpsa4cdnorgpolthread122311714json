It also encouraged women to become sluts, making them unmarryable, because the more partners you have, the harder it is to stay faithful. It also encouraged women to divorce because she can get half his shit so easily, discouraging men from marrying. Making marriage so unattractive for men removes motivation for them to work hard, leading to a decline in society. Sluttiness also led to increased birth control usage, flooding our water with hormones.

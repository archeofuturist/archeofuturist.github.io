We are the future of this country, they are on the wrong side of history.<br><br>Its time to stop listening to the remaining Trump supporters and pretending they are anything but backwards and morally reprehensible. This false equivalence needs to stop, we are vastly intellectually superior and worthy of leading the country, and no we do not need to normalize their small minded bigotry.<br><br>Our views are based on science and facts, they are driven by emotional anger and a sense of white supremacy. I&#039;m so tired at having to pretend there are two valid views and two equal sides, when all of the anti-Trump &quot;liberal elites&quot; who eat organic kale, browse Reddit and watch John Oliver are better informed, more intelligent and just vastly better people than those &quot;patriotic red meat eating&quot; Trump supporters.<br><br>After 100 days of this disaster that is the Trump presidency, its clear that the Republicans are the deplorable bad guys while we are the good guys.<br><br>Trump represents the last dying breath of an uneducated class of whites who are afraid that America is diversifying and that they will lose their white privilege. While we liberals in big vibrantly diverse cities like San Francisco, LA and Chicago are advancing our nation by promoting social justice, feminism, democratic socialism and tolerance, they are the vestigial part of Baby Boomer America that is holding us back.<br><br>They know that we will use our intellectual superiority to eventually destroy their conservative towns by automating their jobs with robots and AI, and they want to stick it to us one last time.<br><br>They know that the future of America is one of tolerance and diversity, that we will become more like Sweden and less like their ideal of a racist 1950&#039;s utopia.","filename":"PtOfhC9","ext":".png","w":1003,"h":1054,"tn_w":237,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493655447769,"time":1493655447,"md5":"38Z5f+RQMbF9AFH+Gq+HMw==","fsize":311652,"resto":0,"id":"oIRRn91V","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"that-tiny-crowd-just-proves-how-little-trump","country_name":"United States","replies":4,"images":0,"unique_ips":4},{"no":123638079,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)12:18:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"So they elected the one man who is disgusting enough to go out there and spew the hate and xenophobia and sexism that would lead to this vision.<br><br>But instead Donald Trump is drowning.<br><br>He&#039;s in over his head, and somewhere in the dim recesses of his addled mind, he knows it.

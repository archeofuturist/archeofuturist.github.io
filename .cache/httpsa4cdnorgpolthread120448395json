Have you ever read the Satanic Bible? Where is the source for that quote from LeVay? The main point that LeVay makes is that the constant guilt-induced self-sacrifice that the Christians feel compelled to preform plays into their hypocritical nature. He advocated self-sacrifice for those who deserve it, like ones family and community.

They had to use their brains to justify and at the same time systematize the faith. But Muslims never needed that: they started with a powerful state and never even needed to have a dialogue with other ideas, philosophy. Early Christians were strongly influenced by Neoplatonism and St. Augustine systematized the faith in such a beautiful way it never became despotic like the other two. In his Confessions this brilliant man even added to the antiquity: inner self, which leads to self reflection. Later it was not Renaissance but Scholasticism of the church that rediscovered Aristotle and this time with St. Thomas the great ancient philosopher was incorporated into Christianity. Additionally, the scholastic Occam with his extreme nominalism introduced terms and signs - which lead to possibility of mathematical explanation of nature - and gave birth to modern natural sciences. <br><br>When I see people bashing Christianity it rattles me, Nordic paganism didn&#039;t create any knowledge, didn&#039;t contribute in anyway except in popular fiction.

I would never take a bullet for a stranger, but for my brother, or sister, or mother or father, of course.

Using it promotes confusion and misunderstanding. The term has been thrown around by various people throughout history - yes - but that doesn&#039;t magically make it real. If we start calling the Japanese &quot;mexicans&quot; and refer to them as that for 1000 years, does that mean were Mexicans? No. <br><br>And from the beginning it has been used as a term with negative connotations - with the message\/idea that the ancient peoples of the british isles were &quot;evil&quot; or &quot;barbarians&quot; or ignorant or backwards before they were conquered. Part of the psychological warfare. Same deal with &quot;pagans&quot;, except it (celtic) is used less so in \/that\/ manner. <br><br>Gaels is a better, more proper term, both factually in a historical sense (not totally free from problems though), and also because Gaels doesn&#039;t misrepresent those ancient people.","filename":"pepe really","ext":".jpg","w":251,"h":242,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":120,"tim":1491857451110,"time":1491857451,"md5":"hafggGOVaqVdO9A8KO5GIg==","fsize":37584,"resto":120448395,"id":"wbwsMFhA","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":120488908,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)16:51:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120488206\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120488206<\/a><br>Might want to look up what the collective unconscious is you illiterate nigger , religion is an expression of the moral ethos of a folk <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Muh culture muh heritage<\/span><br><br>Did you forget where you are kiddo?

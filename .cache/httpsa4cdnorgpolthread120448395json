Have you ever read the Satanic Bible? Where is the source for that quote from LeVay? The main point that LeVay makes is that the constant guilt-induced self-sacrifice that the Christians feel compelled to preform plays into their hypocritical nature. He advocated self-sacrifice for those who deserve it, like ones family and community.

They had to use their brains to justify and at the same time systematize the faith. But Muslims never needed that: they started with a powerful state and never even needed to have a dialogue with other ideas, philosophy. Early Christians were strongly influenced by Neoplatonism and St. Augustine systematized the faith in such a beautiful way it never became despotic like the other two. In his Confessions this brilliant man even added to the antiquity: inner self, which leads to self reflection. Later it was not Renaissance but Scholasticism of the church that rediscovered Aristotle and this time with St. Thomas the great ancient philosopher was incorporated into Christianity. Additionally, the scholastic Occam with his extreme nominalism introduced terms and signs - which lead to possibility of mathematical explanation of nature - and gave birth to modern natural sciences. <br><br>When I see people bashing Christianity it rattles me, Nordic paganism didn&#039;t create any knowledge, didn&#039;t contribute in anyway except in popular fiction.

The 1960s had an establishment conservative push-back against civil rights and social liberalism that was ended the large hangers-on of pre-war conservationism and nationalism. <br><br>The 1980s had a far right revival with neo-nazis and racist skinheads but it was only a subcultural revolt against immigration. While it had no significant political outcome it made a greater impact than the failed 1960s conservative push back and had a legacy some of them carried on.<br><br>The early and mid 00s had another push-back from a mixture of ageing 1980s far-right types and some newcomers against multiculturalism and mass immigration. It failed, but it made limited political breakthroughs for the first time. A lot of people carried on after it spiked but joined more moderate groups afterwards. <br><br>Then we have today&#039;s reactionary spike from 2014 on. It&#039;s had major breakthroughs in places, taken control in places and is as much a cultural revolution as a political and social one. While it might not succeed, it went right up to the reaches of the mainstream. It&#039;s gains might wash away in the near future but unlike before there&#039;s going to be a large base and infrastructure left for next time. <br><br>Care to guess what happens next if now is a flash-in-the-pan? The next wave of reactionary sentiment will succeed in a total victory because it&#039;ll have not only all the infrastructure in place but a generation of whites imprinted by our surge. Once the last remnants of the war generation die off and boomers start dying off in large numbers the numbers are ours. You can point to demographics all you like, but galvanise a large ethnic group even if it&#039;s a large minority by then and then you have all you need to succeed. This wave might have failed to but the next will galvanise all but outlier whites as a reactionary demographic.","time":1492995411,"resto":122507972,"id":"c4poDtXq","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122518747,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)20:59:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122507972\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122507972<\/a><br>oh shut the fuck up, nigger","time":1492995544,"resto":122507972,"id":"aQbq2fE1","country":"SA","country_name":"Saudi Arabia"},{"no":122519081,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)21:02:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"when will the left start protesting against the power elite instead of getting caught up in trivial partisan left-right bullshit?","time":1492995730,"resto":122507972,"id":"ytt7OXdg","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122519385,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)21:04:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122512710\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122512710<\/a><br>lol you are so short sighted<br><br>come back in 5 years, europe is going to be a sectarian, religious hellhole","time":1492995889,"resto":122507972,"id":"ytt7OXdg","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122519429,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)21:05:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122507972\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122507972<\/a><br>Nah, we will just have to resort to violence.","time":1492995914,"resto":122507972,"id":"tb5htc+U","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122519673,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)21:07:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122508814\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122508814<\/a><br>The world never did shit.

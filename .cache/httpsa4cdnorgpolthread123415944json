It has been used as a preservative in vaccines, immunoglobulin preparations, skin test antigens, antivenins, ophthalmic and nasal products, and tattoo inks. In the U.S., Thiomersal has been removed from or reduced to trace amounts in all vaccines routinely recommended for children 6 years of age and younger with the exception of inactivated influenza vaccine. Thiomersal is very toxic by inhalation, ingestion, and in contact with skin (EC hazard symbol T+), with a danger of cumulative effects. It is also very toxic to aquatic organisms and may cause long-term adverse effects in aquatic environments (EC hazard symbol N).[20] In the body, it is metabolized or degraded to ethylmercury (C2H5Hg+) and thiosalicylate.[13] Cases have been reported of severe Mercury poisoning by accidental exposure or attempted suicide, with some fatalities.[21] Animal experiments suggest that thiomersal rapidly dissociates to release ethylmercury after injection; that the disposition patterns of mercury are similar to those after exposure to equivalent doses of ethylmercury chloride; and that the central nervous system and the kidneys are targets, with lack of motor coordination being a common sign. Similar signs and symptoms have been observed in accidental human poisonings. The mechanisms of toxic action are unknown. Fecal excretion accounts for most of the elimination from the body. Ethylmercury clears from blood with a half-life of about 18 days in adults by breakdown into other chemicals, including inorganic mercury.","time":1493515893,"resto":123415944,"id":"Gebi7VsV","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123416472,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)21:31:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123415944\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123415944<\/a><br>unless you are a 90 year old women or immunocompromised or work in hospitals there is absolutely no reason for a healthy young person to get a flu shot","time":1493515913,"resto":123415944,"id":"Tx5btbgy","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"}]}

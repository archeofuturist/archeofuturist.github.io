However it is addictive. You start to doubt every narrative and look for the cynical, logical, but highly unlikely explanations for any events. This leads one to become a conspiracy theorist: Someone who now ignores mountains of evidence for a conventional version of events (e.g. the years of research, thousands of workers accounts, the existence of the rocket itself, and telescopic evidence for the moon landing) in favour of shreds of possible evidence for a logical but absurdly unlikely alternative explanation (they perfectly faked the moon landing and covered it up).<br><br>Note that this the mind set of the average Russian. They still deny they supplied the means to shoot down that civilian aircraft over Ukraine, despite a thorough investigation by a third party. This irrationality suits their conspiracy based logic and political views nicely. The average \/pol\/ user should be above these ways of thinking.<br><br>tl, dr: You&#039;re all addicted to red pills and it&#039;s made you disconnected for logic, evidence, and rationality.","filename":"IBM_classic","ext":".jpg","w":1200,"h":865,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":180,"tim":1491551710291,"time":1491551710,"md5":"QBxhNc4k1cgJQNp7ffmdYw==","fsize":190136,"resto":0,"id":"6m5g2NH0","country":"GB","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"whats-more-likely","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":13,"images":3,"unique_ips":13},{"no":119910441,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)03:58:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119910077\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119910077<\/a><br><br>They didn&#039;t gas themselives you fucking moron.

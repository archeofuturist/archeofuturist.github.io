I can&#039;t take it any more. Have any of you even worked a labor job? I&#039;m talking a simple assembly line job. A job in which a corporation or large company pays you for. <br><br>Have you ever seen the forms you need to fill out and identifications you need? Do you know how fast an illegal would get fired and possibly deported if co-workers even smelled a wife of &quot;illegal&quot; on a fucking mexicunt. <br><br>Holy shit. Where&#039;d the jobs really go? Over seas people. Companies don&#039;t want to pay minimum wage, so they simply use a loophole like every disgusting bottom line saving technique they all do, for all of American history. <br><br>When will you faggots realize it&#039;s all a ruse that you dumb fucks gobble right the fuck up and then ask for seconds of bullshit.<br><br>The stupidity here is killing me. Our middle class is disappearing if not completely gone already without intervention. <br><br>The next time you hear some dumb fucking idiot saying illegal immigration is taking jobs for hard working Americans, or anything close to it, punch them in the stupid goddamn head. <br><br>I hate dirty Mexicans. Don&#039;t get me wrong. I&#039;m not here supporting immigration. Don&#039;t let them in and kick them out when you find them. Just smarten the fuck up when it comes to what the TRUE problem is. Stop looking so fucking dumb you idiots. I&#039;m calling you, the idiot, if you&#039;ve ever believed this to be the reason for middle class jobs disappearing. You are a fucking idiot. Get your shit straight, dumb ass. <br><br>Oh yeah, illegals would be all but eliminated literally in a month if richer faggots stopped hiring them for bullshit, under the table work. Simply make it a clas A felony if someone&#039;s caught hiring.<br><br>tl;dr you stupid fucks think illegal immigrants take jobs. They don&#039;t, dumb fuck.

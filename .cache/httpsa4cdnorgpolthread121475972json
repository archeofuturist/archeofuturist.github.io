That said, there&#039;s something all of you don&#039;t quite understand.<br><br>Every time you try to &quot;red pill&quot; a woman about rapefugees by pointing out the fact that they are, in fact, violent rapists, it falls on deaf ears. Why? Women don&#039;t care.<br><br>They don&#039;t care? Nope. This statement probably confuses even the most hardcore of redpilled misogynists, &quot;But women are always going on and on about rape and rape culture!&quot; That&#039;s just an extension of their rape fantasies. You&#039;re probably clued in on female masochism by now but few of you actually realize it seeps into politics. Women use the made-up concept of &quot;rape culture&quot; to talk about their #1 fantasy, rape. It&#039;s like if a guy who you know has a femdom fetish talks about the &quot;epidemic&quot; of women going around kicking guys in the balls and spitting on them. &quot;Yeah OK, Rick. That&#039;s nice, you weird perverted asshole.&quot;<br><br>However, it isn&#039;t subconscious desire to fuck Arab rapists that leads to women&#039;s apathy regarding rapefugees. It&#039;s a lot more subtle. Think about your reaction to hearing about a 12 year old boy who scored with a hot MILF teacher. It&#039;s probably not one of disgust. But you probably condemn male pedophiles all the time. Why? Your sexual fetish has left you in a state of moral ambivalence. Instead of judging with your mind, you judge with your dick. If you had low testosterone, you might view the situation differently.<br><br>Women know importing tens of thousands of inbred rapists is a bad idea on a logical level but seldom do women use logic when making decisions as I&#039;m sure you all know. On the surface they will condemn any rape, but in their heart they don&#039;t give a shit about the victim. They think about the rape and self-insert, to feel warm and cuddly for one quick moment at the thought of being ravaged by a hairy, villainous sultan. It feels good, feels feminine. Then they put down the newspaper.<br><br>And they think, &quot;It will never ACTUALLY happen to me. It&#039;s just a fantasy.&quot;","filename":"compactmaternalfornicator","ext":".jpg","w":381,"h":422,"tn_w":225,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492401499689,"time":1492401499,"md5":"k+5a+EnQgbtyQM2sigBO2Q==","fsize":18752,"resto":0,"id":"lLKjpggC","country":"US","bumplimit":1,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"i-dont-think-pol-gets-it","country_name":"United States","replies":303,"images":58,"unique_ips":100,"tail_size":50},{"no":121476209,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)00:00:35","name":"\u25b6","com":"<a href=\"#p121475972\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121475972<\/a><br>Also cunts probably subconsciously side with rapists.

I find it hard to believe that she wanted to get raped.<br><br>Also I think unmarried women with no children tend to be most vulnerable to this mentality . All Women, whether feminist or traditionalist or childless, have this innate desire to nurture children and be a mother. This is encoded in every womens DNA. Women who dont have children, like the majority of feminist, channel this desire to nurture to those that deem as persecuted like refugees and dindus. This is why feminists tend to treat minorities like children, and when these refugees do something bad, they absolve them from responsibility and blame the system , similarly like a mother who can&#039;t believe that her own child could be a monster. Just look at Merkel for example. Women with children tend to be a bit more redpilled as they are concerned about their own kids welfare and most dont want their children to grow up in a Marxist shithole. I bet the majority of women who voted for trump were mothers. Women can only be emotionally invested in the welfare of their society if they have children. This is why childless women are so dangerous.

It seems to me that they were always treated as a novelty or oddity, though. If the civilization accepted them, they had their niche, and if not, at worst they tolerated them or threatened to kill them. I think what is taking place in the West would be the first time in modern history that being a tranny would be normalized and openly accepted.<br><br>What ramifications does this pose for our society at large? I imagine that we&#039;ll see the demographic expanded, since more children will question their gender when this shit is shoved in their face and all over the cartoons they watch and taught in schools. I&#039;m not entirely sure having an entire group of people so reliant on the medical industry for their hormones and sex change operations is such a good thing for the future of our nation. We are devoting entirely too much time, energy and resources toward these people and their fixation on their genitals.<br><br>Anybody got anything else?","filename":"Trannies","ext":".jpg","w":632,"h":461,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":182,"tim":1490320798697,"time":1490320798,"md5":"1iX7+NBj9q8TcV1hS2PfkQ==","fsize":188625,"resto":0,"id":"1QX8n7\/b","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-usual-claims-of-degeneracy-aside-what-threats","country_name":"United States","replies":20,"images":0,"unique_ips":13},{"no":118023252,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)22:02:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"Feminizes the white man and makes him castrate himself through hormone injections.

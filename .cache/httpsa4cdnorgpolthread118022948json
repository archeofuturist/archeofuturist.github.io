It seems to me that they were always treated as a novelty or oddity, though.

I imagine that we&#039;ll see the demographic expanded, since more children will question their gender when this shit is shoved in their face and all over the cartoons they watch and taught in schools. I&#039;m not entirely sure having an entire group of people so reliant on the medical industry for their hormones and sex change operations is such a good thing for the future of our nation.

Still much more likely to commit suicide.<br>Johns Hopkins was the first place to do sex changes way back in the &#039;70s. Then they did a survey to find out how suicidal these people felt before and after. There was literally no change in suicidal tendencies so they stopped doing them. But because they stopped doing them this made them an enemy of trannies. And that&#039;s what the real irony of that situation is. They genuinely want to help them while trannies throw retarded &quot;solutions&quot; like sex changes around because they &quot;know&quot; what they want and what you end up with is literally lunatics running the asylum. If I went to a doctor and demanded he put me on a repeat prescription of Prozac he would throw me out and if he did give me it he would be struck off the panel. For the trannies though the (((good doctors))) have no reason not to take their money in return for mutilation, after all it goes directly towards what they want and if they ever appeared before the ethics committee (ethics, top fucking kek) it would make no difference because they&#039;re the same (((people))). <br>If you want to solve the tranny issue then give people the traditional roles they had or put them on a course of Pimozide.

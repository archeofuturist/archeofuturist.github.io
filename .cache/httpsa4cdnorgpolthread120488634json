What\u2019s China\u2019s comment? Second, it is reported that to prepare for potential emergencies in the DPRK, an additional 150,000 troops were deployed to China\u2019s border with the DPRK. Can you confirm that?<br><br>A: About your first question, China has been closely following the developments of the situation on the Korean Peninsula. We believe that, given the current situation, all relevant parties should exercise restraint and avoid activities that may escalate the tension. <br><br>As for the second question, I am not aware of that. There were similar reports by the Yonhap News Agency in the past, which were proved groundless and false in the end. I\u2019m wondering where you got this information. <br><br>Q: US Secretary of State Tillerson said in an interview on Sunday that during the meeting of Chinese and US presidents, China expressed agreement that the situation on the Peninsula has reached a new level of seriousness and threat, and wanted to be supportive in terms of causing the regime in Pyongyang to change its view. What\u2019s your comment on that?<br><br>A: During the Mar-a-Lago summit, both sides confirmed their commitment to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, reiterated that they would continue to fully implement relevant UN Security Council resolutions, and agreed to maintain close communication and coordination on the issue. The Chinese side reaffirmed its commitment to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, peace and stability on the Peninsula and a settlement through dialogue and consultation. We further elaborated on the \u201cdual-track\u201d approach and \u201csuspension for suspension\u201d proposal. We believe that these proposals are legitimate, objective and impartial.

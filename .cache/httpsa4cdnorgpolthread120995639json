The stats are stats but can be both be used as arguments for both allowing them into a country or not letting them in. <br><br>For the side that says let them come in, They can argue that the one should shelter the minority of &quot;non extremists&quot; from the majority and essentially let the majority kill themselves while nurturing and letting grow up new generations of moderate Muslims away from the bad majority in relative peace.<br><br>And then the same stats could be used to argue that naw why take a chance since so many of them are extremist that why take the chance and possibly endangers one own population for.<br><br><br>Though sadly shit is super more nuanced than a bunch of multiple and yes or no questions can show. Since for one the real number of extremist Muslims is kinda hard to genuinely know since many live in places where saying other wise or the opposite could and will end up getting them punished severely or even killed.<br><br><br>So claims or arguments or anything should not be taken at face value since while it could be right the reasoning as to how one got there can be entirely flawed.<br><br>So TL;DR never get to complacent about shit ,especially when it comes to from where or whom one gets ones info about the world, since people and methodologys can be wrong or flawed even if they get they are technically correct.","time":1492134863,"resto":120995639,"id":"P\/xC4Z6z","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121002122,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)22:05:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120995639\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120995639<\/a><br><br>someone post the infograph that shows politifact is run be democratic jews","time":1492135551,"resto":120995639,"id":"Npa1ihAs","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

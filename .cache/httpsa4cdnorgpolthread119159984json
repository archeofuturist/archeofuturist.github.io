Friendly reminder that the war on drugs is unconstitutional:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Paul Hager makes the case that the War on Drugs in the United States is an illegal form of prohibition, which violates the principles of a limited government embodied in the Constitution. Alcohol prohibition required amending the Constitution, because this was not a power granted to the federal government. Hager asserts if this is true, then marijuana prohibition should likewise require a Constitutional amendment.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In her dissent in Gonzales v. Raich (a case argued by Randy Barnett), Justice Sandra Day O&#039;Connor argued that drug prohibition is an improper usurpation of the power to regulate interstate commerce, and the power to prohibit should be reserved by the states. In the same case, Justice Clarence Thomas wrote a stronger dissent expressing a similar idea. Chief Justice William Rehnquist joined O&#039;Connor&#039;s dissent.<\/span>","time":1491035984,"resto":119159984,"id":"rkuPjk2Z","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"}]}

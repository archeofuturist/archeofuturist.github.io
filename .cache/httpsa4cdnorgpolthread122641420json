Further, aerial and ground photographs document the use of the burning pits beyond any doubt.<br>Carlo Mattogno, an Italian Holocaust denier, performed complicated calculations to prove the ovens at Auschwitz-Birkenau couldn\u2019t possibly have cremated the bodies of nearly 900,000 Jews. However, his complex calculations are irrelevant because when there were too many bodies to be handled by the cremation ovens, they were cremated in open-air burning pits behind Crema 5 and one of the two cottages adapted into gas chambers at the back of Birkenau.","filename":"download","ext":".jpg","w":273,"h":185,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":169,"tim":1493069627040,"time":1493069627,"md5":"g0DMc+fxaCI\/FIj0MSYv5g==","fsize":10949,"resto":0,"id":"JaBvku3b","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"how-do-we-know-that-openair-burning-pits-for","country_name":"United States","replies":3,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":122641880,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)17:37:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122641420\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122641420<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;couldn\u2019t possibly have cremated the bodies of nearly 900,000 Jews<\/span><br>That&#039;s holocaust denial.

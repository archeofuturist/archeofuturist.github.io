He said &quot;In the last decades, a profound crisis is shaking the foundations of European culture. A new raison d&#039;etat imposes its law and tries to relegate the Christian roots of Europe to a secondary plane. It would seem that, in the name of secularism, the Bible must be relativised, to be dissolved in a religious pluralism and disappear as a normative cultural reference.&quot;<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Ouellet believes that many Catholics interpreted the teachings of the Second Vatican Council in far too liberal a way and by doing so disconnected from the core of their faith. Relativism led to priests abandoning celibacy, a drop in proper religious education, and a general infusion of leftist politics \u2013 all of which was not the intention of the council. Ouellet stated: \u201cAfter the council, the sense of mission was replaced by the idea of dialogue. That we should dialogue with other faiths and not attempt to bring them the Gospels, to convert. Since then, relativism has been developing more broadly.\u201d<\/span><br><br>And other things that are more Quebec-specific","time":1493846345,"resto":123963596,"id":"d2A2Xh6b","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123966193,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)17:20:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123963596\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123963596<\/a><br>Muslims aren&#039;t the enemy, Jews are.

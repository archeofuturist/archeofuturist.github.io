TAA-affiliated tobacconists are almost always knowledgeable as hell. (They&#039;ll usually have a sign in the window with the TAA logo visible.) They&#039;ll fit you with a pipe that suits your budget and experience.

(You can graduate to meerschaum pipes when you know what you&#039;re doing. Don&#039;t splurge on a meerschaum pipe until you know what size and shape you like to smoke.) Always use matches or a soft flame butane lighter to light the pipe--anything else will either destroy the pipe or the tobacco or both. These are things that your tobacconist will teach you. Your tobacconist can also recommend a good starter tobacco, and will show you how to properly pack and light your pipe.

Next time I see Joshua fucking Feurstein tell me &quot;hur Catholics stop praying to statues and Mary&quot; I&#039;ll have an aneurism. <br><br>Protestanism is shit, its so shit there are probably hundreds of different types because they can&#039;t make up their minds. Catholicism and Eastern Orthadoxy have a structure, a set of rules and teachings set by Saint Peter and Mark themselves, and not some pissy monk, horny king, or literal charlaton (fucking mormons). Either convert to the true faith or just take the next and become an atheist because you&#039;re already a degenerate turncoat.","filename":"IMG_3723","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":235,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":117,"tim":1491952879703,"time":1491952879,"md5":"+1kglooilEQvDQYG\/6DWCw==","fsize":49060,"resto":0,"id":"UaaPZ6nB","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"protestantism-is-trash","country_name":"United States","replies":14,"images":5,"unique_ips":14},{"no":120677553,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)19:35:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120675794\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120675794<\/a><br>any doctrine or ideology is another mans treasure part of balancing act in bread and circuses fairgrounds.

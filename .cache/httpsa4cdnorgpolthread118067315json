No he is not being blackmailed since as any acting President who is being blackmailed (even if it is legitimate) has the resources to make a blackmailing less effective, neutralize it, or prevent it all together by threatening to blackmail back with whatever information loyalist in US spy agencies have.","time":1490354711,"resto":118067315,"id":"cET5gMLx","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118071190,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)07:26:54","name":"Alex","com":"He is a socialist that doesn&#039;t like Russia.

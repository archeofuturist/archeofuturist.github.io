I&#039;m not an jingo, but I believe I wouldn&#039;t mind a death in war. <br><br>And so I ask, I want to become a just leader. I&#039;m in college, but I have haven&#039;t taken anything related to history, politics, or economics. I would like to study subjects related to those in the meantime so that I can become a knowledge leader when I finally amass enough money.<br><br>So where would you recommend I begin? Please ELI5. Currently I have no direction, but I&#039;m reading on Francis Bacon.","filename":"C__Data_Users_DefApps_AppData_INTERNETEXPLORER_Temp_Saved Images_Squelette_bras_full_en","ext":".jpg","w":943,"h":1249,"tn_w":188,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493747093742,"time":1493747093,"md5":"y4+d\/pgE64U3ELX5gMxmZg==","fsize":290836,"resto":0,"id":"JuvzCvR4","country":"BS","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"unrelated-pic-of-studies","country_name":"Bahamas","replies":1,"images":1,"unique_ips":2},{"no":123793904,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)13:47:44","name":"k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a","com":"<a href=\"#p123793561\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123793561<\/a><br>there&#039;s no point<br>the west is fucked","filename":"Kamikaze","ext":".jpg","w":420,"h":584,"tn_w":89,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493747264621,"time":1493747264,"md5":"4ApV2EKNpGC1QA9CX3+SbA==","fsize":103866,"resto":123793561,"id":"aPxHBjwR","country":"GB","trip":"!!8ulOY0Lj8qr","country_name":"United Kingdom"}]}

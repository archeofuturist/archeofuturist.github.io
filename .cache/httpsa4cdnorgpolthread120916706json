Rich Wingo, R-Tuscaloosa, on a 7 to 1 vote. Sen. Linda Coleman-Madison, D-Birmingham, cast the only no vote. The bill passed the Alabama House of Representatives March 16.<br><br>Wingo said religious-based organizations make up 30 percent of child placement agencies in the state.<br><br>\u201cThis bill is simply saying not to discriminate against faith-based child agencies, and not to force them to place children in homes that go against their religious beliefs,\u201d he said.<br><br>Critics of the legislation said it could land the state in legal trouble and prevent children from reaching caring families. Alan Jackson of Pike Road showed the committee a picture of his family, including his husband and his three-year-old nephew, who they have cared since the boy was a year old. The bill, Jackson said, could use a person\u2019s sexuality to deny adoption rights.<br><br>Tabitha Isner, a minister who has served as a foster parent, told the committee she \u201ccouldn\u2019t see what\u2019s to be gained from this.\u201d<br><br>\u201cNo child placement agency in Alabama has ever been threatened with adverse action based on a decision it made for a religious reason, but here we are making a bill to protect them from that never-happened thing,\u201d she said.<br><br>The bill moves on to the full Senate.<br><br>The Senate Health Committee Wednesday passed a host of bills that included a ban on assisted suicide; a health care provider conscience law and a constitutional amendment declaring Alabama a pro-life state. The bills could trigger lawsuits if they become law. Sen. Cam Ward, R-Alabaster, who supported the legislation, said in committee he would add amendments on the Senate floor requiring the state to use in-house counsel should Alabama find itself defending the laws in court.","filename":"adoption","ext":".jpg","w":700,"h":525,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1492094579614,"time":1492094579,"md5":"DAe83IVkLH+VJMNye0Mobg==","fsize":147373,"resto":0,"id":"DBXJrnP\/","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"bill-passes-alabama-house-allowing-religious","country_name":"United States","replies":4,"images":1,"unique_ips":5},{"no":120917201,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)10:47:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120916706\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120916706<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;maybe you should tell heterosexual couples to stop having children they wont take care of<\/span><br><br>But I do?

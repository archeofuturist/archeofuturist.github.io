The first big political initiative for every admin is usually the hardest because its where the rubber meets the road, and uncertainty about where everyone stands.<br><br>I&#039;m trying to look at how Trump will go forward by how looking back at his business career and books (read all but I think 1 over the years). Rhetoric aside, he is very consistent in how he conducts his business. <br><br>We wants to reward loyalty and avenge disloyalty. He is open to making deals - 50% is better than 0%. Most importantly, in his business dealing, though it may come as a shock to some, he is a long-term strategist. The 100-day list of goals is a shift from what he has done in the past, but he will forgo short-term loss for long-term gain.<br><br>We shouldn&#039;t be stressing about this so much - and trying to fire or blame people just b\/c of this.

This brings the unrelated postings to the top of the forum list, and the critical posting &#039;slides&#039; down the front page, and quickly out of public view. Although it is difficult or impossible to censor the posting it is now lost in a sea of unrelated and unuseful postings. By this means it becomes effective to keep the readers of the forum reading unrelated and non-issue items.<\/span><br><br>(continues)","filename":"1484143233666","ext":".gif","w":768,"h":410,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":66,"tim":1490470569964,"time":1490470569,"md5":"ZkwjCLlE+QgDTSbAhWwHpA==","fsize":373964,"resto":118260483,"id":"uxjDsBUu","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118261885,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)15:36:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"TIFFANY IS HOTTER IVANKA&#039;S AN UGLY KIKE","time":1490470579,"resto":118260483,"id":"Ly2dr\/dT","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118261895,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)15:36:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118261773\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118261773<\/a><br>The fur of a wolfgirl","time":1490470582,"resto":118260483,"id":"94\/\/z8Cj","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":118261897,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)15:36:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118261616\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118261616<\/a><br>She is going to put Madcow to shame.

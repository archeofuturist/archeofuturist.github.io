The first big political initiative for every admin is usually the hardest because its where the rubber meets the road, and uncertainty about where everyone stands.<br><br>I&#039;m trying to look at how Trump will go forward by how looking back at his business career and books (read all but I think 1 over the years). Rhetoric aside, he is very consistent in how he conducts his business. <br><br>We wants to reward loyalty and avenge disloyalty. He is open to making deals - 50% is better than 0%. Most importantly, in his business dealing, though it may come as a shock to some, he is a long-term strategist. The 100-day list of goals is a shift from what he has done in the past, but he will forgo short-term loss for long-term gain.<br><br>We shouldn&#039;t be stressing about this so much - and trying to fire or blame people just b\/c of this.

They watch the news. The read newspapers. Or John Oliver. Or SNL. You get the picture. And what do they see on these programs? They see an absolute buffoon of a man, someone who&#039;s simultaneously ridiculously stupid, racist and lucky beyond comprehension. To them, all of this simply must be true without question.

So now they demonize and dehumanize Trump and his supporters as a means of building common ground, may that be through jokes or virtue signaling to everyone how much of a good person they are. And thus begins a cycle of irrational hatred.<br><br>I love Trump, but he is not a perfect man, and there is plenty to criticize him for. But to hate him at the level others do? It is unnatural, and frankly, unreasonable to do so. I don&#039;t think that they actually hate Trump the person, just the concept of an evil man with the name of Trump.

Here&#039;s my criticism:<br><br>While its good that he speaks his mind, its sometimes foolish statements, half truths, cryptic answers, or unrelated things that come out of his mouth (baron is great with computers for example). In addition he cannot convey his points as fluid as would be desirable. This leads to weeks of he-said she-said which detracts from getting more important things discussed or accomplished, which doesnt help when the media is after him like the snakes they are. In addition, while this may seem as appealing to some he lacks tact where it is necessary. No bullshit tactic is all well and good until you phrase something wrong and piss off the wrong people, and this is evidenced by even estranging himself from those he should keep close, even if theyre not really his friends. Plus he acts a tad childish sometimes when someone gets on his ass, takes it real personally. Forsnt act like the bigger man when it might be mote prudent. Pick your battles and all that.<br><br>Most importantly he needs to learn the ins and outs of government and fast. His first few months in office (to no fault of his own) have been bumbling around trying to figure out how to manage the stupid amounts of red tape he has to navigate. Its not like his days as the executive of the company where he says jump and people say how high, he now has to manage oppose g factions with power. If he wants to keep his promises he best shape up in the coming months.<br><br>I also dislike his cabinet picks. DeVos for example.

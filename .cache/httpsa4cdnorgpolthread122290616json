Pay special attention to the S fund as long as Trump is in office and congress is controlled by GOP.<br><br>-Have a separate savings acct w\/ Navy Federal--their rates are awesome. Put money into a CD for the length of your term in, or, better yet, save up cash (besides cash you&#039;re putting in to your TSP) to ladder up with CD accts so you can get a good healthy down payment on a house.<br><br>-VA loan--use it. The Navy is a great option for someone who wants to invest in real estate because you&#039;ll be stationed in places where houses appreciate at ridiculously high rates like southern CA or FL. Once you have a good down (probably after your term) (try to get at least 20% down on whatever place you&#039;re looking at), BUY A HOUSE. Do not rent. Buy. <br><br>-Get married for that BAH--it&#039;s triple what you&#039;d be paid as an E-nothing. Take this advice with caution, though; a divorce can be many times more expensive than the total cost of the marriage. Best qualities in a marriage partner: chill, trustworthy, intelligent and ambitious. Learn what personality disorders are, learn the signs, and no matter how hot a bitch is who displays any red flags of narcissism or Borderline Personality Disorder...RUN, don&#039;t walk, the other way. Don&#039;t even fuck her. <br><br>-Don&#039;t be a promiscuous asshole. San Diego, for instance, has one of the highest rates in the WORLD for HIV for military members. Vet your sexual partners.<br><br>-Don&#039;t drink too much at bars. If you do, pregame. This is a huge money sink and will lead to more huge money sinks. <br><br>-Don&#039;t get dishonorably or generally discharged. This sounds obvious but believe me, it isn&#039;t for a lot of retards out there.<br><br>-UTILIZE YOUR EDUCATION BENEFITS. If you don&#039;t already have college, or even if you do, be aware of small things that will save you a lot of cash in the long run--CLEP tests and DSST tests, for instance, are wholly free for active duty members.","time":1492877500,"resto":122290616,"id":"qbPdXagW","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122293474,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)12:14:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122292980\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122292980<\/a><br>Brother is in the air Force, best food and you get protected.

The qualities you&#039;re looking for in a marriage partner, not surprisingly, are qualities you want to look for in friends. Even if you aren&#039;t religious, genuinely religious people make pretty good friends who probably won&#039;t fuck you over. Look for people who have a middle-class upbringing or are the kind of people who will become middle class. Guys from Utah, New York state, Montana and other areas with an emphasis on labor (and areas that typically feature a large politically conservative population) bear people with a great work ethic who are loyal to their friends, and will get you far. <br><br>-Hide you fucking power level. If you are in any way a racist or whatever, keep in mind you will be working for\/with black and Mexican people, and even people from other countries. Keep in mind that the demands of the military tend to sift out the niggers from the Blacks and spics from Hispanics. If you want to avoid an integrated workplace to some extent, do not go into logistics (LS), operations (BM), or administration (PS\/YN). Also FYI: black people are awesome to work with and so are Mexicans to a large degree unless you&#039;re in engineering. Avoid Asians and Filipinos, they all suck as a general rule and only look out for each other.<br><br>-Learn a different language and take a DLPT for it. Even if you aren&#039;t in a rate where it&#039;s relevant, you will receive a stipend depending on what you learn. Currently, I believe only languages like Russian, Mandarin Chinese, and middle-eastern languages (Arabic, Pashtu) will get you cash. Hebrew might as well. Spanish and Tagalog probably *won&#039;t*. Look into it.<br><br>-Don&#039;t buy a new fucking car. Dealerships and salesmen in high-density military areas are absolute sharks. In fact, for the first two years, just avoid buying a car altogether--you aren&#039;t going to use it. All it will be is a liability, I fucking promise you.","time":1492878148,"resto":122290616,"id":"qbPdXagW","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122295003,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)12:27:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"Do it for a few years then Join a private security firm like blackwater","time":1492878432,"resto":122290616,"id":"VVgtTwc5","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122295335,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)12:30:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122294483\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122294483<\/a><br><br>cont.<br><br>-Just like what <a href=\"#p122293825\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122293825<\/a> said.

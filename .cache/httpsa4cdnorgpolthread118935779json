materialist then it is spread for the sake of (((Tikkun Olam))). The doctrine Tikkun Olam is to destroy all belief systems to cause a catastrophic end forcing (((their))) god to come and unfuck everything, though it ends with a Zionist world order.<br><br> Atheism isn&#039;t necessarily bad, but most atheists are edgy retards and don&#039;t hold stable values, they follow in line with feminists in being critical of every social system, but they never see the importance in the systems they seek to overthrow. A society cannot maintain itself with completely amorphous values, some people realize that and just elect to keep their brand of atheism to themselves.<br><br>Ask an atheist man this, who do you trust to be more stable in a relationship a woman who has been religious her entire life, or one who is completely liberated and scoffs at every traditional system? I&#039;m an athiest myself, but I see the value in some of the practices other religions have setup; their guidelines and laws weren&#039;t pulled out of thin air, they were developed thousands of years ago by warlords, priests, warriors, and politicians who wanted their civilizations to survive. Not all religions do that necessarily, but it isn&#039;t too hard to figure out which ones are better to have around than others.

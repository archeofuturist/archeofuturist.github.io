I check out of society one and a while and feel like an outsider looking in when it comes to this event in Syria. I generally avoid news of any kind outside of the web and am not up to snuff on why Trumpers feel so betrayed as of this weekend? Why is this a bad thing and can their not be an ulterior motive like all his other plays have revealed in hindsight since January?","time":1491764275,"resto":120303541,"id":"WxpV7M5k","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120319276,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)14:59:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120314560\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120314560<\/a><br><a href=\"#p120312212\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120312212<\/a><br><a href=\"#p120312581\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120312581<\/a><br>Pic related, This is why<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;You=BTFO<\/span><br><a href=\"#p120314560\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120314560<\/a><br>Stop saying &quot;nigga&quot; you sound like a mongoloid from Detroit <br><a href=\"#p120314560\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120314560<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;HURR DURR I CAN SHOOP IT<\/span><br>discord.gg\/wjDVqW4<br><br>Go look for your self faggot","filename":"1491760490042","ext":".png","w":636,"h":337,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":66,"tim":1491764359975,"time":1491764359,"md5":"X82h22VgT7LmSOD+jvyJqg==","fsize":46149,"resto":120303541,"id":"FPAP0MhG","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120319309,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)14:59:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120303541\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120303541<\/a><br>stage 4<br>fuck trump","filename":"kubler_ross","ext":".jpg","w":880,"h":369,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":52,"tim":1491764381127,"time":1491764381,"md5":"3wI+lM+bzHbGcY0YzhrdGQ==","fsize":69008,"resto":120303541,"id":"8B8EXOjz","country":"AT","country_name":"Austria"},{"no":120319543,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)15:01:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"Sage this plebbit tier thread","filename":"IMG_1373","ext":".png","w":800,"h":820,"tn_w":121,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491764487696,"time":1491764487,"md5":"8Gcuk04zWKLO9M6h9Ey8Fg==","fsize":471854,"resto":120303541,"id":"a4\/c+erh","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120319616,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)15:02:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120319089\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120319089<\/a><br>People arent betrayed its just a coordinated shill effort because they&#039;re dumb as fuck<br>See<br><a href=\"#p120319276\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120319276<\/a><br>Rex Tillerson is already sayinf that we aren&#039;t going to ww3 in syria, in fact we&#039;re cooperating somewhat with them<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;WTF HOW??<\/span><br>Cause 4d chess is too intelligent for idiot shills like <a href=\"#p120317680\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120317680<\/a>","time":1491764525,"resto":120303541,"id":"FPAP0MhG","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120319633,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)15:02:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120309655\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120309655<\/a><br>I feel the same.

You cant get a good job because of lack of experience, you cant get experience because not one privateer will take you in for training and give you a document proving you worked for experience because that costs him 100e a month.<br>On the other hand, you can always run off to the village, farm your own food, eat your own animals, brew your own alcohol and even smoke your own tobacco.<br>There are no luxuries unless you can find a steady earning in the village, and you are sooner to find treasure of Tzar Dushan than to earn a proper dime form agriculture.<br>Is it worth coming to the west in search for jobs?<br>Bare in mind i have never seen a faggot, a nigger or an arab in person. Id be nauseous and agitated if i did see a faggot.","filename":"1485771048499","ext":".jpg","w":274,"h":206,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1490117038456,"time":1490117038,"md5":"I9+oXC3ywLz9a1T+Pjj5tA==","fsize":13583,"resto":0,"id":"MF4WRAmh","country":"BA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"my-bosniak-aunt-that-ran-away-from-war-she","country_name":"Bosnia and Herzegovina","replies":4,"images":3,"unique_ips":4},{"no":117646341,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)13:25:07","name":"Anonymous","filename":"tri-prsta","ext":".jpg","w":480,"h":290,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":75,"tim":1490117107143,"time":1490117107,"md5":"h6bl12BB27zKGyadM1zYuw==","fsize":15762,"resto":117646200,"id":"L\/5Gn0JU","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":117646447,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)13:26:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117646341\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117646341<\/a><br>aj ne seri","filename":"25347697","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":480,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1490117166364,"time":1490117166,"md5":"837qmv7+H8tcpPjmfKSoMQ==","fsize":76561,"resto":117646200,"id":"MF4WRAmh","country":"BA","country_name":"Bosnia and Herzegovina"},{"no":117646717,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)13:28:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117646447\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117646447<\/a>","filename":"25347699","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":405,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":84,"tim":1490117318528,"time":1490117318,"md5":"th6Km\/usvutkU37ACTxMMQ==","fsize":48578,"resto":117646200,"id":"M\/5rm30e","country":"BA","country_name":"Bosnia and Herzegovina"},{"no":117648012,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)13:40:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117646200\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117646200<\/a><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=--9<wbr>qJHSW3A8<br><br>Probably race riots because the white brits don`t want to be replaced by the likes of those in the link above but I don`t see any Yugoslavia scale happening.<br><br>I went to Maglaj and Sarajevo last year and I thought it was pretty cool.

So even though we are not saved by works, our works flow from faith. Actually, Peter Kreeft put it well,<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Faith is the root, the necessary beginning. Hope is the stem, the energy that makes the plant grow. Love is the fruit, the flower, the visible product, the bottom line. The plant of our new life in Christ is one; the life of God comes into us by faith, through us by hope, and out of us by the works of love.<\/span>","time":1491519735,"resto":119809939,"id":"cQa9OeYY","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":119812844,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)19:14:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119811133\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119811133<\/a><br>What are you gonna do?","filename":"IMG_1703","ext":".png","w":1334,"h":750,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":70,"tim":1491520489850,"time":1491520489,"md5":"juqxGHdJbSExvN3aEm3EJg==","fsize":1262462,"resto":119809939,"id":"yH75qLeI","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":119813525,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)19:19:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119810333\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119810333<\/a><br>Did you attend the school","time":1491520798,"resto":119809939,"id":"yH75qLeI","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119814574,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)19:27:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119810333\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119810333<\/a><br>Are you B J F?","time":1491521227,"resto":119809939,"id":"yH75qLeI","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

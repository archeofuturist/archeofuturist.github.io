You can live in truly masculine (or even hypermasculine) environments or have the freedom to express yourself and not live in fear of expressing your feminine qualities. You will live your true life. Your partner will understand your body and sex drive unlike any woman could. You will be free to do whatever kinky shit you&#039;ve always wanted to do and can explore the full extent of your sex drive. You know when your partner orgasms. Although you are at a higher risk for some std&#039;s, you can easily get tested and wear a condom. If you&#039;re both clean you can have sex without the fear of pregnancy. There are no periods. You fully understand the way your partner communicates, like another man. <br><br>Masculinity is always revered and the male form is always seen as beautiful. You can literally find men anywhere in the world on your phone who are willing to have sex with you.","filename":"prostate","ext":".gif","w":500,"h":373,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":186,"tim":1493160764331,"time":1493160764,"md5":"s4JKlgy5\/MLczgQtx8tMpg==","fsize":156940,"resto":0,"id":"qcomUgH5","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"homosexuality-is-the-ultimate-redpill","country_name":"United States","replies":10,"images":1,"unique_ips":7},{"no":122803142,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)19:04:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"bumping the truth","time":1493161462,"resto":122801539,"id":"QaYoGcEj","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122804919,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)19:17:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122801539\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122801539<\/a><br>Increased risk of AIDS<br>Rectal Tearing<br>No Kids to keep us from becoming like Zimbabwe, South Africa, or Brazil.<br><br>No thanks.

A lot of it is covered by municipal taxes. But the federal system takes over because roads are also needed federally in the advent of a war where the army would need to use it so they have federal funding for it.<br><br>Currently there are taxes at the pump in certain countries for road maintenance so the motorists are targetted to fund this. This isn&#039;t a bad idea but I find the cost so negligible it could just be all transfered to municipal taxes it wouldn&#039;t make much a difference.","time":1492569965,"resto":121777567,"id":"NoSj3Q4v","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121789433,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)22:49:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121788285\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121788285<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121788338\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121788338<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;muh cayman islands<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;muh panama papers<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;muh corporations going to ireland<\/span><br><br>you can have your high tax rate but when people pack up and leave it really is annoying when you whine about it desu<br><br><a href=\"#p121788882\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121788882<\/a><br>they seem to think roads need to be ripped out and redone every week with the amount they like to allocate to it","time":1492570196,"resto":121777567,"id":"YSMthFfs","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":121790359,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)22:56:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121788250\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121788250<\/a><br>a divine rights order is an order where the king who recieves his right to rule over a people by God. It&#039;s a monarchy, an absolute monarchy. It&#039;s what we had before the coup d&#039;\u00e9tat revolutions. For thousands of years, as far as I know, under such orders we had NO socialism because a man is entitled to the sweat of his brow. <br><br>When you have a king he is the state. There&#039;s no power behind him. The biggest influence on him is the church. No lobby, no special interest, nothing. He raises just enough taxes to pay for all that he needs to keep the roads, the justice system and the military. <br><br>In France there was a three tier system which also separated how and who paid taxes (and remember they paid between 1-5% if they were collected at all and the latter in times of war. There was the clerical tier which paid no taxes. There were the nobles which paid less taxes. Basically a noble is someone who has merited to get into this tier through valor on the battlefield or subsequently through such privileged lineage. The nobles were the ones who fought the wars. And finally there were the commoners which included just about everyone and they paid normal tax rates (again 1-5%).<br><br>It happened that the taxes were so low sometimes the state suffered and didn&#039;t want to raise them so they indebted themselves or they had to stop building things to lower expenditures. Basically the only time taxes were really raised was during wars. The very rich who had big houses during that time (who were very few) paid at most 10%, out of war it was 5% for them. So the average peasent paid 1% or less, the rich 5% and that&#039;s about it.<br><br>You can read up on monarchic times or check out documentaries on youtube about it.","time":1492570617,"resto":121777567,"id":"NoSj3Q4v","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121790654,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)22:59:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121788278\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121788278<\/a><br>because all things you can get under a social program the free market can provide better for you at a lower cost.

His agenda is our agenda, shared by 70-80+% of the population - get our economy back on track, have peace with others, and bring back jobs. We don&#039;t want feckless wars or internal strife. <br><br>These last two weeks have been tough on him and us. Let&#039;s especially fast and pray for him Friday through Sunday.

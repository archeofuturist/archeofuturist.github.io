I had to look at my 7 year old daughter, with my eyes filled with tears that the first woman President didn&#039;t win. I never, ever want to relive that day. Just put yourself in her shoes - She heard her daddy tell her everything Donald Trump has said about women, it was unfathomable that he would win. All of her hopes and dreams instantly crushed.<br><br>It took weeks for me to recover, I hid away, took leave off work and spent most of my time sleeping. I didn&#039;t want to live in a world where the President elect is a racist, transphobic misogynist.<br><br>This continued for days. I couldn&#039;t eat, I was neglecting my family, I cried, I watched Netflix until my eyes burned and I drank my sorrows away.<br><br>Days later, it dawned on me. America isn&#039;t as lost as I thought it was. More people, more patriotic Americans saw that this man could not be trusted. They cast their votes for the first female President and she won the popular vote.<br><br>Hillary Rodham Clinton won the election. Hillary Clinton is the President of the United States.","filename":"hillarywon","ext":".jpg","w":1920,"h":1080,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1492500907775,"time":1492500907,"md5":"cg6Qg5kWQN3BBJ3C2y1jIA==","fsize":191212,"resto":0,"id":"hroMxREn","country":"AU","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"hillary-clinton-won","country_name":"Australia","replies":16,"images":4,"unique_ips":16},{"no":121654769,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)03:36:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"Take into account the rigging that went on and illegals that voted and I&#039;m pretty sure PRESIDENT TRUMP won, shill.","filename":"trump laugh","ext":".jpg","w":400,"h":400,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492501003245,"time":1492501003,"md5":"SDvS57BcULZNKwwv2Dd61Q==","fsize":12825,"resto":121654676,"id":"rJkKeJDG","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121654848,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)03:37:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121654676\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121654676<\/a><br><br>Lmaooo eat shit cunt.

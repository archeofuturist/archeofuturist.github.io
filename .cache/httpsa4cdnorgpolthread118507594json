In 1999, Russia was a dynamically developing young democracy with independent presidential, parliamentary and judicial branches of power, political competition, a real multi-party system and working federalism. After 15 years of Pytin&#039;s rule, Russia is an authoritarian regime adopting all the worst features of the USSR that led to its collapse, with the absolute powers of the president, the lack of political competition, the semi-party system and the actual appointment of local authorities. Fail.<br><br>Society. In 1999, Russian society was secular and focused on the values of the civilized world, in Russian cities the population was monoracially Russian, the media was free, there was no censorship on the Internet. After 15 years of Pytin&#039;s rule, Russian society was trapped in archaic values and ideas about life, a significant percentage of the population of once Russian cities are immigrants from the Caucasus, Africa, Southeast and Central Asia, far from civilized norms of life and morality, the media turned into a propaganda tool, censorship is being introduced on the Internet.

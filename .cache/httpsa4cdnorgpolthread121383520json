Unfortunately, the US&#039; war on drugs has created such a mental roadblock for everyone here that without thinking about it for even a second, drug addicts are viewed as criminals, not people who need help. A heroin addict is no different from a heroin dealer in most American eyes. It&#039;s odd that this same attitude towards personal responsibility applied elsewhere would probably have decimated the catholic clergy for their pedophilia and put lots of the same people doing the persecution in jail for their significant alcohol-related problems.","time":1492363460,"resto":121383520,"id":"ZG9Qc7Jc","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121385141,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)13:26:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121384432\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121384432<\/a><br>I&#039;ve never tried it because I know it&#039;ll be enjoyable, and I&#039;d want to do it again.

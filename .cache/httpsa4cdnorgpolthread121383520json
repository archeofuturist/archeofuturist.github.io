Drug addictions are formed out of medical dependencies all the time, so saying all drug addicts are degenerates who just want to get, and stay, fucked-up is extremely closed-minded. Heroin dependency is created from prescription opiate addictions all the time once the opiates stop being prescribed. Those who have never been addicted to anything have no idea how strong the desire is; it&#039;s like hunger or thirst, and becomes your only concern. That&#039;s why people willingly lose families and careers for drugs, not because they&#039;re degenerates who don&#039;t deserve help. My point is that there arte facets about this discussion that you either aren&#039;t considering, or simply have no experience to aid the formation of a well-considers op[inion for you. As hard as it is to think about, your own children may develop a drug problem one day, and you&#039;ll be forced to face the fact that this issue is more complex than one that can be solved simply by shitting on the afflicted until they stop doing drugs. Psychologists often compare the personality traits of those who are typically drawn to drugs as natural as those that steer a person towards organization or being thorough. It isn&#039;t always about just making a bad decision out of hedonistic desires. It could happen to you, too. The conditions would probably have to be extreme, but never think addiction can&#039;t touch you in a way that would force you to abandon the urge to simply discard the afflicted.","time":1492367084,"resto":121383520,"id":"ZG9Qc7Jc","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121392786,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)14:24:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121392351\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121392351<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;heroin became hugely unpopular about 20 years ago<\/span><br>Right, why do you think this happened?<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;t. guy who saw Platzspitz and Letten with his own eyes.<\/span>","time":1492367097,"resto":121383520,"id":"LV8Wkoge","country":"CH","country_name":"Switzerland"},{"no":121393000,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)14:26:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121392368\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121392368<\/a><br>Really how can you NIGGERS rationalize being cancer in foreign countries, helping your future lords to undercut local tradition and create slaves.

Chrysaor is believed to be related to the Pegasus spyware that was first identified on iOS and analyzed by Citizen Lab and Lookout.<br><br>Late last year, after receiving a list of suspicious package names from Lookout, we discovered that a few dozen Android devices may have installed an application related to Pegasus, which we named Chrysaor. Although the applications were never available in Google Play, we immediately identified the scope of the problem by using Verify Apps. We gathered information from affected devices, and concurrently, attempted to acquire Chrysaor apps to better understand its impact on users. We&#039;ve contacted the potentially affected users, disabled the applications on affected devices, and implemented changes in Verify Apps to protect all users.","filename":"2475921168","ext":".jpg","w":512,"h":288,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1491297669505,"time":1491297669,"md5":"FYgy9fEcl8UzCr5GEr5JKw==","fsize":36859,"resto":0,"id":"AC5NRnlu","country":"IL","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"an-investigation-of-israeli-malware-on-android","country_name":"Israel","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

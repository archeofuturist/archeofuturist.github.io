This image would not have been appropriate for their time and would not have been understood by their Greek contemporaries. In contrast, a study of the origins of the Hexaemeron, the six-day account of creation, found in the first chapter of Genesis reveals that it was written to respond to the seemingly victorious Babylonian civilization confronted by the Israelites several centuries before their encounter with the Greeks. Here, the human author of the sacred text used images familiar to their pagan contemporaries to refute the Enuma Elish, the Babylonian creation account that claimed that the world was created when Marduk, the god of light, killed the primordial dragon. 14 Thus, as Cardinal Ratzinger points out, it is not surprising that nearly every word of the first creation account addresses a particular confusion of the Babylonian age. For instance, when the Sacred Scriptures affirm that in the beginning, the earth was without form and void (cf. Gen. 1:2), the sacred text refutes the existence of a primordial dragon. When they refer to the sun and the moon as lamps that God has hung in the sky for the measurement of time (cf. Gen. 1:14), the text refutes the divinity of these two great celestial bodies believed to be Babylonian gods.<\/span>","time":1493406858,"resto":123226276,"id":"pc97pa8O","country":"IN","country_name":"India"},{"no":123231874,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)15:15:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"For the Poles http:\/\/episkopat.pl\/en\/benedykt-xvi<wbr>-do-uczestnikow-konferencji-o-konce<wbr>pcji-panstwa-wybrany-temat-prowadzi<wbr>-wladze-panstwowe-i-koscielne-do-di<wbr>alogu\/<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Pope Benedict XVI says atheism &amp; radical Islam create an explosive situation that threaten OUR continent<\/span>","time":1493406903,"resto":123226276,"id":"JnveH6XM","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123232292,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)15:18:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123228721\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123228721<\/a><br>He was a great man who understood the faith and people so well.

He commanded us to celebrate sacrifices and services, and that it should not be thoughtlessly or disorderly, but at fixed times and hours. He has Himself fixed by His supreme will the places and persons whom He desires for these celebrations, in order that all things may be done piously according to His good pleasure, and be acceptable to His will. So then those who offer their oblations at the appointed seasons are acceptable and blessed, but they follow the laws of the Master and do not sin. For to the high priest his proper ministrations are allotted, and to the priests the proper place has been appointed, and on Levites their proper services have been imposed.

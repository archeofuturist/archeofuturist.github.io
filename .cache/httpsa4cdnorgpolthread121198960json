Despite the perception of the epidemic as primarily afflicting the rural working class, drug overdoses account for a greater percentage of deaths among the young in large cities and their suburbs, with urban and suburban whites most at risk.<br><br>The crisis has hit particularly hard in New England and in parts of Ohio, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. Those are the places where fentanyl, a potent synthetic opioid, started to flood into the heroin supply five to 10 years ago. Bodies began piling up.<br><br>\u201cIt just blew through all the measures we\u2019d been taking,\u201d said Dr. Alex Walley, the director of the Boston University Addiction Medicine Fellowship program. Fentanyl, which acts on opioid receptors in the brain but isn\u2019t made from the opium poppy, is up to 50 times more powerful than heroin. Because of that potency, Dr. Walley said, there\u2019s less time after an overdose for someone to intervene. The drug\u2019s short half-life means that users have to inject more frequently, increasing the risk of transmitting H.I.V., hepatitis and other blood-borne diseases.<br><br>https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/interactive<wbr>\/2017\/04\/14\/upshot\/drug-overdose-ep<wbr>idemic-you-draw-it.html","filename":"Screen Shot 2017-04-15 at 6.56.24 AM","ext":".png","w":1078,"h":826,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":191,"tim":1492254130445,"time":1492254130,"md5":"XTQdoU6TJ5cD5FAYNYxayA==","fsize":115909,"resto":0,"id":"6QJIC1fc","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"how-can-we-keep-our-kids-from-getting-hooked-on","country_name":"United States","replies":3,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":121199127,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)07:04:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121198960\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121198960<\/a><br>This has nothing to do with drugs and everything to do with the Soviet style collapse of the USA and American society. 2008 was your 1991, but you don&#039;t admit it. <br><br>The same shit with drugs\/alcohol happened in Russia after 1991.

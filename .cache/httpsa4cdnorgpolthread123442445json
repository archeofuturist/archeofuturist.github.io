Real life is happening all around, but all their attention is on social media. In the 80&#039;s people made much deeper connections because they were always interacting with each other without interruption. The only connection to the outside world was a phone attached to the wall. When it rang, it was much more important too. It wasn&#039;t a telemarketer or an alert that someone you barely remember from high school posted a picture on Faceberg. People verbally made plans in person and were expected to show up. The plans weren&#039;t tentative and cancelled with a text message because a 3rd party texted a more appealing option. It was much more difficult for women to get attention so they would become desperate and do a lot of really cute and awkward things for you to notice them. It seems the more connected we become, the less we value those connections.","filename":"1492124536394","ext":".jpg","w":620,"h":800,"tn_w":96,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493536168272,"time":1493536168,"md5":"9nsI7P642qRvnfFsN5jEwQ==","fsize":73962,"resto":123442445,"id":"VycYdhl+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123450061,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)03:09:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123442445\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123442445<\/a><br>When I was 12 my dad asked the flight crew if I could go and have a look in the cockpit and they said yes. <br><br>Went and had a look, it was sweet","time":1493536195,"resto":123442445,"id":"XSsSoHfs","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":123450156,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)03:10:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123448770\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123448770<\/a><br>Dragon 32 &gt; Commodore 64 &gt; Amiga 500 &gt; Amiga 1200 later upgraded to some monster in a full tower.<br><br>The first video game I ever played was my cousins Atari Pong machine.","time":1493536258,"resto":123442445,"id":"0Wxy7Xru","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":123450194,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)03:11:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123449642\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123449642<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;used to be you could spend months on a game before you finished it, not hours.<\/span><br><br>Kids these days will never know this horror.

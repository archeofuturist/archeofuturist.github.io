To the contrary: the extent of a fiefdom was measured not by its area but by the number of serfs, because for most of its history Russia suffered a shortage of workforce relative to the size of its arable territory. The other thing that did not quite happen so often as the text suggests are the petty wars of nobles, although it did happen sporadically, especially in the Troubled Century.<br><br>I think whoever wrote this was extrapolating from Western serfdom.

This means the bot can post, upvote and downvote all it wants but it will have no way of telling if it&#039;s shadowbanned. In fact, you could be shadowbanned right now and not know it. Until I reply to your comment, then you know you aren&#039;t shadow banned. The reason they do this is because if the bot knew it was banned, it would just make a new bot and continue exploiting. This way, the bot will keep doing stupid stuff not knowing it&#039;s been banned all along, and no new bot will replace it until it finds out.<br><br>This is where the reason for fuzzing comes in. Once the bot downvotes, reddit detects it was a downvote from a shadowbanned bot and tacks on an upvote to balance that banned bot&#039;s vote. This way, the total upvote count is totally unaffected by all shadowbanned bot votes, and the shadowbanned bots actually think their vote counted (but it did not.) This is vote fuzzing. It also randomly adds both 1 downvote and 1 upvote at random intervals so that the bot can&#039;t tell if its downvote just got upvote cancelled, or if it&#039;s just reddit doing its fuzzing. The total end count stays totally accurate, but when you see the background numbers (you aren&#039;t really supposed to be able to see the background votes) you can see the fuzzing happening.<br><br>This is also why you see almost perfectly agreeable posts get thousands of downvotes. They aren&#039;t real downvotes, they are fuzzed. It might literally have 10 downvotes, but the fuzzing will add a lot more on.<br><br>Example: A comment or post with 14572 upvotes and 11442 downvotes could very well be closer to something like 3504 upvotes and 374 downvotes. However, both values still result in the end tally of a total of 3130 up.&quot;<br><br>You can see this just by refreshing any given page and see the votes change every single time on every entry and comment.","time":1490689779,"resto":118594143,"id":"0nyn7CQD","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118628711,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)04:31:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118605637\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118605637<\/a><br>Niiiice","time":1490689885,"resto":118594143,"id":"JqF\/lVXt","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":118628970,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)04:36:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118628606\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118628606<\/a><br>Fuck i was wondering why that kept happening to my posts.","time":1490690169,"resto":118594143,"id":"8bZZKy7Q","country":"NZ","country_name":"New Zealand"},{"no":118629315,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)04:42:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118626747\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118626747<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;doesnt know how to read 2 seperate charts<\/span><br><br>fucking retard","time":1490690550,"resto":118594143,"id":"NhAuRBqD","country":"NZ","country_name":"New Zealand"},{"no":118629395,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)04:43:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118605637\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118605637<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Do that again but REALLY put your back into it this time<\/span>","filename":"ray1","ext":".jpg","w":745,"h":569,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":95,"tim":1490690637427,"time":1490690637,"md5":"7mILKHiHEhFIGOZcVXl69Q==","fsize":93036,"resto":118594143,"id":"ns+otp5d","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":118629687,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)04:49:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118612837\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118612837<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;doesnt know what sarcasm is<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;literal autism<\/span>","time":1490690982,"resto":118594143,"id":"NhAuRBqD","country":"NZ","country_name":"New Zealand"},{"no":118629896,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)04:53:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118594494\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118594494<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Chinese Americans don&#039;t exist<\/span><br>Nice.","time":1490691190,"resto":118594143,"id":"geAFTffs","country":"TR","country_name":"Turkey"},{"no":118630135,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)04:57:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118627777\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118627777<\/a><br>Czeched","time":1490691440,"resto":118594143,"id":"+wIzSJof","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118630147,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)04:57:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118628606\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118628606<\/a><br>That was only for submitted posts and it was removed. <br><br><a href=\"#p118628970\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118628970<\/a><br>It doesn&#039;t work with normal comments.","time":1490691449,"resto":118594143,"id":"v5syHvDj","country":"EE","country_name":"Estonia"},{"no":118630148,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)04:57:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118627612\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118627612<\/a><br>maybe<br><br><a href=\"#p118627777\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118627777<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;no one has checked these quads yet<\/span>","time":1490691450,"resto":118594143,"id":"NhAuRBqD","country":"NZ","country_name":"New Zealand"}]}

If we take the behavior of those engaging in immorality at this university as a standard, and multiply it across the country to include those currently in education across the country, and then if we assume this behavior has been happening in a similar fashion for the last 30 years then you can begin to see the scale of the problem. Drugs, violence, alcohol, misguided politics, laziness, and an outright denial of the moral good, pumped out of universities all across the country for years is a truly unforgivable crime. It is a crime that is being unpunished, and actively encouraged by the university system itself.","time":1491134609,"resto":119173708,"id":"3pFr5G9y","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119192849,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)08:04:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119191638\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119191638<\/a><br>Nice one mate, any idea where you want to go?<br>If you get offered RAMC as a medical support officer do not take it.

Focus on excluding outside influence, social pressure, institutional pressure, peer pressure to engage in immorality. That means traditional media, non-traditional media, groups of peers, any opinions of the staff and faculties should be immediately and irrevocably discarded. Focus solely on your studies. Do not attempt to engage them on any level other than claiming any educational benefit for yourself. Do not let yourself be infected by this destructive immorality. Cleaning your mind of filth is difficult, and there is a chance you will be derided, in the same way a smoker derides non-smokers yet fills their body with cancerous chemicals and will die much sooner and a lot poorer. These people are your mortal enemy.","time":1491134667,"resto":119173708,"id":"3pFr5G9y","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119192939,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)08:05:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119192813\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119192813<\/a><br>don&#039;t use &quot;degeneracy&quot;<br>in fact it&#039;s good with just three &quot;vice, debt and lies&quot;","time":1491134725,"resto":119173708,"id":"horfNaM2","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119193148,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)08:08:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119192878\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119192878<\/a><br>and thats all i have so far. <br><br>Thinking of going through drugs, alcohol, partying, sexual relations, left wing politics giving examples of each and condemning them all.<br><br>just for a laugh","time":1491134919,"resto":119173708,"id":"3pFr5G9y","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119193215,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)08:09:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119178520\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119178520<\/a><br>Yeah I&#039;m alright","filename":"cf4d1342ffa3bb0d26c7116f9c4348d5","ext":".png","w":599,"h":396,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":82,"tim":1491134977904,"time":1491134977,"md5":"z00TQv+juw0mxxFvnENI1Q==","fsize":192019,"resto":119173708,"id":"lAE9IRUe","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119193238,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)08:09:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119192516\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119192516<\/a><br>Go ahead and show me some footage of him sucking in debates.","time":1491134988,"resto":119173708,"id":"KQCxXr8g","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119193419,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)08:12:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119192813\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119192813<\/a><br><a href=\"#p119192878\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119192878<\/a><br>It&#039;s going to hit deaf ears.

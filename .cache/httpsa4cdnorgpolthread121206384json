The Jews? Boomer conspiracy?<br><br>--<br><br>The rate of stroke among young people has apparently been rising steadily since 1995, according to a study published this week. Hospitalization rates for stroke increased for women between the ages of 18 and 44, and nearly doubled for men in that age range from 1995 through 2012.<br>Using more-detailed data for 2003 through 2012, the researchers found that rates of hospitalizations for acute ischemic stroke increased by nearly 42 percent for men 35 to 44, while rates for women of the same age group increased by 30 percent over the same time, the study published in the JAMA, the Journal of the American Medical Association.<br>Across all adults, including those in older age ranges, stroke was the fifth leading cause of death in 2013. Overall mortality rates from strokes have significantly decreased over the past 50 years due to multiple factors, including better treatment for hypertension and increased use of aspirin, even as incidence of acute ischemic stroke among young adults has been on the rise.<br>The study also looked at stroke risk factors and whether there were any changes in their prevalence from 2003 to 2012. The likelihood of having three or more of five common risk factors \u2014 diabetes, hypertension, lipid disorders, obesity and tobacco use \u2014 doubled in men and women hospitalized for acute ischemic strokes.","filename":"stroke","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":594,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":247,"tim":1492260142892,"time":1492260142,"md5":"MEixDSsP1KGAhRRWDWK+iQ==","fsize":126995,"resto":0,"id":"EAr8ikoU","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"stroke-rates-appear-to-be-rising-steadily-in","country_name":"United States","replies":7,"images":1,"unique_ips":7},{"no":121206589,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)08:44:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"Maybe stop eating so much then you wouldn&#039;t have more strokes amerifat","time":1492260294,"resto":121206384,"id":"bMZ8I7vN","country":"LT","country_name":"Lithuania"},{"no":121206722,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)08:46:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121206589\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121206589<\/a><br>Carbs are addicting, it is not my fault. <br><br>Also, not all who get them are fat:<br><br>https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/nati<wbr>onal\/health-science\/this-fit-young-<wbr>woman-was-having-strokes-and-doctor<wbr>s-didnt-know-why\/2017\/01\/09\/54797c8<wbr>4-c47a-11e6-8422-eac61c0ef74d_story<wbr>.html","time":1492260396,"resto":121206384,"id":"EAr8ikoU","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121209988,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)09:25:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"Bump","time":1492262755,"resto":121206384,"id":"Bk9B838H","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":121210816,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)09:36:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121206722\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121206722<\/a><br>http:\/\/www.cochrane.org\/CD011054\/FE<wbr>RTILREG_risk-heart-attack-and-strok<wbr>e-women-using-birth-control-pills<br>also, dysgenics (inherited clotting disorders) played a part, but don&#039;t expect a study on it anytime soon","time":1492263386,"resto":121206384,"id":"VEK2ZIli","country":"MY","country_name":"Malaysia"},{"no":121210881,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)09:37:16","name":"Deathstroke","com":"<a href=\"#p121206384\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121206384<\/a><br>We eat some much platified shit now, no wonder we get cancer","time":1492263436,"resto":121206384,"id":"21dDs5Mo","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121210972,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)09:38:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121206384\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121206384<\/a><br>Can&#039;t believe I voted for this conman.

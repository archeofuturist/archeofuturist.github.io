There are women who are based and critically evaluate their opinions that deserve a say in politics and can think for themselves. And women are attracted to emotional dependence - they&#039;re not attracted to you because you&#039;re a miserable piece of shit who has wasted away his entire life. There are many women who deserve a voice - and what they say is far more important than anything that comes out of your cucked mouth. <br><br>Sage.","time":1493535102,"resto":123446024,"id":"hK04cZKS","country":"NZ","country_name":"New Zealand"},{"no":123449300,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)03:00:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123446024\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123446024<\/a><br>Get cucked trudindu","time":1493535639,"resto":123446024,"id":"6YI80VoA","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123449522,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)03:03:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123448570\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123448570<\/a><br>You&#039;re either a woman, a fagot, a virgin or a cuck.. Women are easily manipulated perpetual teenagers who have zero loyalty to tribe. You really can&#039;t rely on womens instincts when it comes to politics. Sure there are women who are based, but they are in the minority. It&#039;s not a good idea to give an entire group that power and responsibility based of a few cherry picked persons. The solution honestly is to have voter qualification. Like a civics exam for people who become US citizens. This way only based and informed people get a say. If you can&#039;t name the vice president you have no business deciding the future of my country period! And I&#039;ve met countless women who vote based on &quot;oh he&#039;s cute&quot;.","time":1493535802,"resto":123446024,"id":"nvhkeomQ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123450519,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)03:16:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123448570\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123448570<\/a><br><br>^^ one of the SJWs targeting \/pol\/ for a class assignment. <br><br>&quot;women are attracted to emotional dependence&quot;<br><br>Hahahahaahahahaaaaaaaaaaa","time":1493536585,"resto":123446024,"id":"Sv28hWCy","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

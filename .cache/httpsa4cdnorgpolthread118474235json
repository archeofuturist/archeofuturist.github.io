His path will be much easier if he thinks and behaves as the system requires. In that sense the system is acting for the benefit of the individual when it brainwashes him into conformity.&quot;<br><br>This is interesting. The system does all that it can to preserve the system - that includes modifying human behavior via psychology and perhaps in biological techniques. In school, we go through vast amounts of Holocaust education, vast amounts of diversity training, and vast amounts of anti-Western propaganda. This is to ensure that the system is preserve. The system is not merely academia or the media - it&#039;s everything. It&#039;s the foundational myths of our society, which is liberty, equality, and fraternity. The system wants to make women whores. The system wants race-mixing. The system wants homosexuality and trans-gender. This is the government. This is the media. This is academia. The Moldbug called the Cathedral. It will do anything it can to ensure that the system is preserved. <br><br>Most on \/pol\/ fell so demoralized and so hurt to find out the truth about our society and system. It is one gigantic lie. And the system is so vast and so powerful, that attempting to challenge it will produce nothing by frustration and stress and demoralization and low-self esteem, and depression. This is why \/pol\/ feels as it does - and even though \/pol\/ was warned, \/pol\/ persisted. And that&#039;s what it must do, because it is the honorable thing to do. <br><br>Most people know that they can&#039;t fight the historical trend toward which we&#039;re heading, and they know they cannot fight government and corporation. So they fall in line with the system, even though they know the system, too, produces great unhappiness and great stress and great frustration.","time":1490593538,"resto":118474235,"id":"ukBIrR62","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118478668,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)01:49:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118474235\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118474235<\/a><br>Jacques Ellul &gt;&gt; Ted Kaczynski<br><br>Ted was on the right track but needed to focus more on the importance of tradition over what&#039;s wrong with our current system.

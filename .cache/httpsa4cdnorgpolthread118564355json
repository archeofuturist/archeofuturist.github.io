What happened with ryancare? What have they been doing for the past 8 years? They should have been planning this, and now substantial tax reform is going to be exponentially more difficult to accomplish. It won&#039;t be long before DJT starts courting Pelosi and Schumer, he hates incompetence and that is exactly what the Republicans have demonstrated. I voted for Trump, and I plan on doing that again, but the party of Reagan just shit the bed.","filename":"image","ext":".png","w":1484,"h":939,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":158,"tim":1490649907356,"time":1490649907,"md5":"qJSXSIl+qWINKcOk6fUWzA==","fsize":682762,"resto":0,"id":"GY6frAB5","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"and-so-it-begins","country_name":"United States","replies":18,"images":2,"unique_ips":13},{"no":118564784,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)17:29:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118564355\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118564355<\/a><br>Trump will have to court the dems to fix some issues that many of them agree with him on, ex (((insurance companies))), state lines.<br><br>But why will tax reform be harder?","time":1490650157,"resto":118564355,"id":"rjuA1Asx","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118565602,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)17:36:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118564784\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118564784<\/a><br>Government spending would have gone down trillions had the healthcare budget reform passed, giving more wiggle room and a larger budget for tax cuts.","time":1490650601,"resto":118564355,"id":"GY6frAB5","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118565739,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)17:37:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118564355\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118564355<\/a><br>Most republicans, including Ryan were preparing for 2020 when Trump became president. <br><br>Pelosi and Schumer will lose political support from the far left if they talk with Trump.

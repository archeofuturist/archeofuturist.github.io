So here&#039;s the basic gestalt about Assad:<br><br>- Only secular leader in the middle east (protect Christian minorities...)<br>- Is directly at war with ISIS<br>- Most of the rebels against him (if not all) are islamists<br>- Is against israel and keep them in check<br>- Never done anything against the west<br><br>Removing him would mean:<br><br>- Another chaos like in Iraq\/Lybia<br>- Islamists taking over<br>- More terrorists and more immigration<br>- Increased Israel and Saudi influence in the area<br>- More dead Americans for nothing<br><br>I memed for Trump during the presidential race and i don&#039;t regret it, better him than shillary. The situation is way too unclear for now to know if he truly betrayed us or if it was another 11D chess move, i still hope it&#039;s the latter. We need to calm the fuck down about this and to be more pragmatic. Reminder that we put principles over politicians and that the results are the only thing that truly matters.","filename":"can&#039;t mossad the assad","ext":".jpg","w":480,"h":359,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":186,"tim":1491648370800,"time":1491648370,"md5":"oGoUi98KVWDcv1fWHNAqyQ==","fsize":13579,"resto":0,"id":"JDr1SCWJ","country":"FR","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"why-pol-support-assad","country_name":"France","replies":168,"images":30,"unique_ips":64,"tail_size":50},{"no":120117524,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)06:47:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120117468\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120117468<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; More dead Americans for nothing<\/span><br>As something bad.","time":1491648431,"resto":120117468,"id":"iAk34GJS","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":120117601,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)06:48:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"((They)) hate him, good enough for me.","time":1491648509,"resto":120117468,"id":"kouFUxyw","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120117687,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)06:49:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"Because everytime arabs lose their dictadors they turn insane.

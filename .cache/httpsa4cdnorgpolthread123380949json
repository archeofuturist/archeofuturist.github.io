This is the perfect moment for us, Romanians, to unite under our glorious flag and reconsider our position inside the Union. We have known for too long what it is like to be under foreign countries control and our ancestors always fought against the dominance imposed by these monsters ( see Russian Tsardom, Austro-Hungarian Empire, Ottoman Empire, Communist USSR ). <br><br>We&#039;ve been played and passed around but ALWAYS managed to break free from our &quot;puppet masters&quot;. The time has come again. We are losing our traditions and embracing foreign ones which have nothing in common to ours, we are indoctrinated and enslaved in a world where we must obey what is being commanded from Luxembourg. We are working ourselves until exhaustion for minimum wage, yet the taxes and contributions we pay are being misused and are not improving our nation&#039;s healthcare, education, industry and transport system. We instead look at beautiful and useless expensive decorations, pointless architecture being built and events organised, all of these being made by our politicians, things which boost the masses happiness for a few weeks in order to vote them again.","filename":"acvila-romaneasca","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":281,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1493499698362,"time":1493499698,"md5":"eqtPheu4AnRvWfw8hptIzw==","fsize":34642,"resto":0,"id":"spnJVL7+","country":"RO","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"nationalism-in-romania","country_name":"Romania","replies":31,"images":2,"unique_ips":13},{"no":123380994,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)17:02:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123380949\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123380949<\/a><br>This leads to our country&#039;s political parties.

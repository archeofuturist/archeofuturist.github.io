I live in the 666 Fifth Avenue building on the 11th floor. I&#039;m 36 years old. I believe in taking care of myself and a balanced diet and rigorous exercise routine. In the morning if my face is a little puffy I&#039;ll put on an ice pack while doing stomach crunches. I can do 1000 now. After I remove the ice pack I use a deep pore cleanser lotion. In the shower I use a water activated gel cleanser, then a honey almond body scrub, and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub. Then I apply an herb-mint facial mask which I leave on for 10 minutes while I prepare the rest of my routine. I always use an after shave lotion with little or no alcohol, because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look older. Then moisturizer, then an anti-aging eye balm followed by a final moisturizing protective lotion.","filename":"1491768418656","ext":".jpg","w":300,"h":162,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":67,"tim":1492604160394,"time":1492604160,"md5":"nz129bSQed7pgNAmrjq7eA==","fsize":6991,"resto":121837207,"id":"BScuMwuS","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121837409,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)08:16:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/121828650#p121837255\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121837255<\/a><br>It&#039;s Georgia, the dems have almost no chance in a runoff.<br><br>Plus, if the dems use the same strategy they did this time (flooding TV, radio, and billboards with adds for their candidate) Georgia voters will vote repub just to spite them.

Atheism is in decline worldwide, with the number of atheists falling from 4.5% of the world&#039;s population in 1970 to 2.0% in 2010 and projected to drop to 1.8% by 2020, <br><br>Real surveys and statistics say atheism is on the decline worldwide. Sorry atheists but atheism is not on the rise nor is it winning. It&#039;s still the minority and a declining one at that. <br><br>The Pew Research Center&#039;s statistics show that atheism is expected to continue to decline all the way into 2050 with a continued growth of religion. Other research also shows a huge surge in growth for Christianity in China which is currently the world&#039;s most &quot;atheist&quot; nation because of the atheist communist government suppressing religion, the research suggests that China will soon become the world&#039;s most Christian nation within 15 years. <br><br>This is simply history repeating itself: Christianity prospered in Rome back in the ancient era when it was suppressed and it still grew in the militant atheist soviet Russia when it was suppressed there only a century ago with the majority of Russians today now also identifying as Christian. Just goes to show that atheist suppression of religion still doesn&#039;t stop religion.<br><br>Sources for the legion of whiny \/Redditor\/ fedoras that will no doubt show up it this thread:<br><br>http:\/\/www.pewforum.org\/2015\/04\/02\/<wbr>religious-projections-2010-2050\/<br>http:\/\/www.pewforum.org\/2012\/12\/18\/<wbr>global-religious-landscape-unaffili<wbr>ated\/<br>http:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/news\/wor<wbr>ldnews\/asia\/china\/10776023\/China-on<wbr>-course-to-become-worlds-most-Chris<wbr>tian-nation-within-15-years.html<br>http:\/\/masterrussian.com\/russia\/fac<wbr>ts.htm","filename":"1490142549767","ext":".jpg","w":608,"h":755,"tn_w":201,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491514652986,"time":1491514652,"md5":"gbLQR\/M\/TdWWLU+dYjIA+Q==","fsize":123410,"resto":0,"id":"jcxlOfwC","country":"PL","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"atheism-is-the-fastest-shrinking-religion-in-the","country_name":"Poland","replies":9,"images":1,"unique_ips":8},{"no":119799337,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)17:39:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119799046\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119799046<\/a><br>those niglets look retarded as shit<br>like zika retarded","time":1491514770,"resto":119799046,"id":"hsATtCyX","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119799478,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)17:40:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;to smart too breed<\/span>","time":1491514833,"resto":119799046,"id":"Yf2v7weX","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119800033,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)17:44:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"Atheism isn&#039;t a religion, you stupid cunt.","time":1491515086,"resto":119799046,"id":"sbrKxnLp","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"},{"no":119800203,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)17:46:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119799046\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119799046<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Atheism<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;religion<\/span><br><br>My sides","time":1491515166,"resto":119799046,"id":"Vb7zvVdo","country":"BE","country_name":"Belgium"},{"no":119800209,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)17:46:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"This is a copypasta thread down to the image, fuck off with the shit spam.","time":1491515168,"resto":119799046,"id":"sCLrk0Es","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119800525,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)17:48:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119800209\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119800209<\/a><br>Truth deserves to be said over and over again.","time":1491515313,"resto":119799046,"id":"jcxlOfwC","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":119800532,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)17:48:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119800033\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119800033<\/a><br>Hello newfag. <br>it must suck being a lonely virgin","time":1491515317,"resto":119799046,"id":"RS5oYolw","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119800541,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)17:48:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"Nice edit, Christfag.","filename":"Original","ext":".jpg","w":608,"h":755,"tn_w":100,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491515321836,"time":1491515321,"md5":"x9N7IPhcEu3nAJFdtnd+Pg==","fsize":134861,"resto":119799046,"id":"zuJ86YS\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119800794,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)17:50:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119800541\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119800541<\/a><br>I wouldn&#039;t call it nice.

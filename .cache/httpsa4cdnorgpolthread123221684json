Why do I never hear about Whites doing this? Anyone here in the hospitality industry with experience with dine and dashers who can fill me in?<br><br>--<br><br>Bar staff at The Queen Vic had roughly $250 walk out the door Sunday night courtesy of a group of diners that brazenly exited the neighborhood pub \u2014 with their meals and dinnerware in tow.<br><br>\u201cIt\u2019s really odd. In my 30 years of doing this in the business, I have never seen this,\u201d owner Ryan Gordon, who wound up posting security camera footage of the head-scratching heist on social media, said of the bizarre exodus. \u201cIt caught me off guard.\u201d<br><br>The crime occurred at 11:05 p.m. on Sunday, he reports; the offenders did the deed while the bartender went into the kitchen to get food for someone else.<br><br>Gordon estimates the loss at $100 for food, plus drinks, and $150 for the plates \u2014 which \u201care expensive,\u201d he sighs. He didn\u2019t call the cops, however, because it wasn\u2019t that big a deal in the grand scheme of things. (And the waiter at the scene claims the perpetrators must be from \u201cout of town,\u201d as he\u2019s never seen them in the neighborhood before.)<br><br>\u201cIt\u2019s such a minor thing I wanted to do a shame thing vs. anything else,\u201d Gordon said, of posting their mugs on the internet.","filename":"securitycam","ext":".jpg","w":960,"h":720,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1493401931461,"time":1493401931,"md5":"89fY4Ewzv74lyuCYor14Rw==","fsize":56502,"resto":0,"id":"YaY3e8RU","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"out-of-town-diners-dash-off-with-250-dollars-of","country_name":"United States","replies":7,"images":0,"unique_ips":8},{"no":123222052,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)13:55:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"Niggers believe they are entitled to steal because of slabery an sheeyit.

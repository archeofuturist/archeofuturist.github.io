Then, a period of prepping follows in which the bull is pleasured by the cuck. When the bull class has been prepped, there will be time for wife to get mounted by the bull, and eventually the functions of the husband will become indistinguishable from the functions of a porn shot fluffer, and his genitalia will &#039;wither away&#039; as Marx said.<\/span><br><br>I don&#039;t have any websites but i&#039;m pretty sure OP can help me with that.","filename":"1490568985404","ext":".png","w":1010,"h":1010,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492522799667,"time":1492522799,"md5":"l8vZtt4WUtUw+3\/dqcoJeg==","fsize":212480,"resto":121678433,"id":"weElgRnz","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":121685618,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)09:40:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"hElLO c0mRaDeS!!!~~ tHiS g3nErAl iS 4 tHe DiScU55 of MaRxIsM-lEnInIsM, ThE iDeOl0gY oFFFFF ReVoLuTioNaRy SoCiAlIsM aNd CoMuNiSm~~~ (LoVe!!!!)<br><br>C0MMUNI5M~~~ iS THE NEXT BIG THING iN lIkE 4eVa!~~~~<br>WhAt eXcLy i5 CoMuNiSm:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;CoMuNiSm HoPiN h3 wILL n0tIcE u~~~<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;CoMuNiSm iS bEiN iNsEpArAtAbLe FrOm u FRIENDS!!!~~~~~<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;To MaKe CoMuNiSm U nEeD 2 sEiZe MeMes (LOL SO RANDOM XDDDDD) oF pRoDuCtIoN fRoM tOsE FAKE BOURGEIZE SLUTS (i hate them so much! )<\/span><br>https:\/\/www.livejournal.com\/archive<wbr>\/marx\/works\/1847\/11\/prin-com.htm<br>https:\/\/www.livejournal.com\/archive<wbr>\/marx\/works\/1848\/communist-manifest<wbr>o\/","filename":"1490896750207","ext":".gif","w":400,"h":400,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492522848722,"time":1492522848,"md5":"HWBi2i3h+wSahpUt7HVasA==","fsize":314328,"resto":121678433,"id":"weElgRnz","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":121685686,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)09:41:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"yo KANGZ an KWEENZ.

During the lifetime of great revolutionaries, the oppressing classes constantly hounded them, received their theories with the most savage malice, the most furious hatred and the most unscrupulous campaigns of lies and slander. After their death, attempts are made to convert them into harmless icons, to canonize them, so to say, and to hallow their names to a certain extent for the \u201cconsolation\u201d of the oppressed classes and with the object of duping the latter, while at the same time robbing the revolutionary theory of its substance, blunting its revolutionary edge and vulgarizing it. Today, the bourgeoisie and the opportunists within the labor movement concur in this doctoring of Marxism. They omit, obscure, or distort the revolutionary side of this theory, its revolutionary soul. They push to the foreground and extol what is or seems acceptable to the bourgeoisie. All the social-chauvinists are now \u201cMarxists\u201d (don&#039;t laugh!). And more and more frequently German bourgeois scholars, only yesterday specialists in the annihilation of Marxism, are speaking of the \u201cnational-German\u201d Marx, who, they claim, educated the labor unions which are so splendidly organized for the purpose of waging a predatory war!<\/span>","filename":"2614250-lenin","ext":".jpg","w":300,"h":338,"tn_w":110,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492535272493,"time":1492535272,"md5":"\/dQI7iXXUY7fVrXX4g+PqQ==","fsize":13726,"resto":121678433,"id":"ED0xstNe","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":121708676,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)13:09:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121706178\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121706178<\/a><br>Venezuela was a disaster for a little while before Chavez came in.

Then, a period of prepping follows in which the bull is pleasured by the cuck. When the bull class has been prepped, there will be time for wife to get mounted by the bull, and eventually the functions of the husband will become indistinguishable from the functions of a porn shot fluffer, and his genitalia will &#039;wither away&#039; as Marx said.<\/span><br><br>I don&#039;t have any websites but i&#039;m pretty sure OP can help me with that.","filename":"1490568985404","ext":".png","w":1010,"h":1010,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492522799667,"time":1492522799,"md5":"l8vZtt4WUtUw+3\/dqcoJeg==","fsize":212480,"resto":121678433,"id":"weElgRnz","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":121685618,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)09:40:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"hElLO c0mRaDeS!!!~~ tHiS g3nErAl iS 4 tHe DiScU55 of MaRxIsM-lEnInIsM, ThE iDeOl0gY oFFFFF ReVoLuTioNaRy SoCiAlIsM aNd CoMuNiSm~~~ (LoVe!!!!)<br><br>C0MMUNI5M~~~ iS THE NEXT BIG THING iN lIkE 4eVa!~~~~<br>WhAt eXcLy i5 CoMuNiSm:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;CoMuNiSm HoPiN h3 wILL n0tIcE u~~~<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;CoMuNiSm iS bEiN iNsEpArAtAbLe FrOm u FRIENDS!!!~~~~~<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;To MaKe CoMuNiSm U nEeD 2 sEiZe MeMes (LOL SO RANDOM XDDDDD) oF pRoDuCtIoN fRoM tOsE FAKE BOURGEIZE SLUTS (i hate them so much! )<\/span><br>https:\/\/www.livejournal.com\/archive<wbr>\/marx\/works\/1847\/11\/prin-com.htm<br>https:\/\/www.livejournal.com\/archive<wbr>\/marx\/works\/1848\/communist-manifest<wbr>o\/","filename":"1490896750207","ext":".gif","w":400,"h":400,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492522848722,"time":1492522848,"md5":"HWBi2i3h+wSahpUt7HVasA==","fsize":314328,"resto":121678433,"id":"weElgRnz","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":121685686,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)09:41:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"yo KANGZ an KWEENZ.

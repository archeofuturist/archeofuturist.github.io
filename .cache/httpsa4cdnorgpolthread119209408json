You can do the exercises slowly, which stretches the muscles more, or fast, which increases the strength (nowadays, we&#039;d say speed strength or explosive strength) more and tones the inner organs. But you shouldn&#039;t train more than 6-8 minutes.<br><br>There are also exercises with apparatus, for which no rep scheme is included. But it&#039;s said that one may never be exhausted after doing them, so vary the reps appropriately.<br><br>I am looking for the book: <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;H.Dv. 475.

I don&#039;t read schnitzel-runes, but from what I can tell from the illustrations, the exercises are really similar to what was being published in Boy Scout manuals of the same era. Low-impact calisthenics and stretching. Not really useful for building strength or stamina as any modern routine, except if you&#039;re a fatass or a lanklet, as conditioning for real workouts. And in that case you&#039;ve probably be better off just doing a real workout as much as you can than using this kind of stuff to build to it. <br><br>Physical culture really changed between the first half of the 20th century and the second. Some of the changes were bad, the &quot;use steroids and cable machines to get JACKED&quot; ones, but most of the changes were for the better. The routines in Sandow and co&#039;s books really didn&#039;t age well, at all.","time":1491148726,"resto":119209408,"id":"VFE3F7gU","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119212927,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)11:58:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119212742\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119212742<\/a><br>Would be thousand times better than being a ladyboy.","time":1491148727,"resto":119209408,"id":"dK9Td9\/a","country":"BG","country_name":"Bulgaria"}]}

The U.S. would beat North Korea in a war but South Korea would pay a heavy price.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;TOKYO \u2014 If the United States were to strike North Korea, Kim Jong Un\u2019s regime would retaliate by unleashing its conventional weaponry lined up on the demilitarized zone that has separated the two Koreas for about seven decades. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The Second Corps of the Korean People\u2019s Army stationed at Kaesong on the northern side of the DMZ has about 500 artillery pieces, Bermudez said. And this is just one army corps; similar corps are on either side of it.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;All the artillery pieces in the Second Corps can reach the northern outskirts of Seoul, just 30 miles from the DMZ, but the largest projectiles could fly to the south of the capital. About 25 million people \u2014 or half of the South Korean population \u2014 live in the greater Seoul metropolitan area. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u201cThis could do a lot of damage,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they hit a high-rise building with a couple of rounds of artillery, people get into their cars, causing huge traffic jams, so North Korea could target highways and bridges in cascades.\u201d <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;If North Korea were to start unleashing its artillery on the South, it would be able to fire about 4,000 rounds an hour, Roger Cavazos of the Nautilus Institute estimated in a 2012 study. There would be 2,811 fatalities in the initial volley and 64,000 people could be killed that first day, the majority of them in the first three hours, he wrote. <\/span><br><br>https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/worl<wbr>d\/asia_pacific\/twenty-five-million-<wbr>reasons-the-us-cant-strike-north-ko<wbr>rea\/2017\/04\/21\/47df9fea-2513-11e7-9<wbr>28e-3624539060e8_story.html","filename":"North Korean artillery range","ext":".jpg","w":1484,"h":1511,"tn_w":245,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492862565356,"time":1492862565,"md5":"1QyyYdmYcB3IAZRaoZDslg==","fsize":522759,"resto":0,"id":"KTgCU0Of","country":"GB","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"twentyfive-million-reasons-the-us-hasnt-struck","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":8,"images":1,"unique_ips":8},{"no":122270078,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)08:07:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122269741\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122269741<\/a><br>The us lost in vietnam against some gooks with sticks.What makes you think they would win against a country thats been preparing for war for 50 years?","time":1492862826,"resto":122269741,"id":"Q1UKQIzD","country":"HU","country_name":"Hungary"},{"no":122270251,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)08:09:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"norks lol<br><br>without china to back them up they would get BTFO","time":1492862962,"resto":122269741,"id":"3EAv9+vy","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122270480,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)08:12:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122270078\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122270078<\/a><br>Why do people keep spreading this meme?<br>The US won almost every battle they fought and completed their main objectives.

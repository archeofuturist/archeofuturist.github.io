Drugs, such as cocaine, nicotine and amphetamines, also lead to an increase of dopamine in the reward system of the brain. Addiction is an extreme form of behaviour that employs existing neuronal networks that produce manic behaviour, manifested as elation, increased cognition and grandiose self-perceptions. Hitler, Stalin and Napoleon, for example, all appeared incapable of empathy and of comprehending the value of human life, condemning thousands to death in suicidal military campaigns. Yet, it is likely that power itself (rather than any specific behavioural aberration), may have been responsible for exaggerating certain behavioural traits that each individual exhibited.<br>http:\/\/theconversation.com\/the-neur<wbr>ochemistry-of-power-has-implication<wbr>s-for-political-change-23844","time":1490467389,"resto":118243142,"id":"p4CMC+Br","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118256129,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)14:46:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118243142\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118243142<\/a><br>No you,<br>sloth and self-wrath is a sin.","time":1490467603,"resto":118243142,"id":"vFE6wglO","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":118256218,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)14:47:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118245932\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118245932<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I&#039;m here<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;But why am I here?<\/span><br>Blind.","time":1490467652,"resto":118243142,"id":"vFE6wglO","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":118256337,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)14:48:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118247877\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118247877<\/a><br>Some people wished they&#039;d die when they died.<br>But the problem is we don&#039;t know.","time":1490467714,"resto":118243142,"id":"vFE6wglO","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":118256433,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)14:49:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118248101\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118248101<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;1. people are in denial about the fact that there is no God<\/span><br>Science is esotericism.<br>Esotericism is the discovery of god.<br><br>Lurk moar.","time":1490467769,"resto":118243142,"id":"vFE6wglO","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":118256437,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)14:49:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118244998\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118244998<\/a><br><br>this<br><br>lol@ jews and muslims ignoring the savior","time":1490467771,"resto":118243142,"id":"mKRfxlgl","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118256624,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)14:51:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118254094\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118254094<\/a><br>Look up &quot;keys to the kingdom&quot;.<br><br>Jesus told them to be esoteric.","time":1490467883,"resto":118243142,"id":"vFE6wglO","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":118256989,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)14:54:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"Faith is the most bluepilled concept known to man.","time":1490468062,"resto":118243142,"id":"MXJW9fWu","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118257093,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)14:55:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118243142\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118243142<\/a><br>The picture supposing to represent Jesus is itself a sin.<br><br>btfo","time":1490468120,"resto":118243142,"id":"IHQk5XgK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118257315,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)14:57:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118257093\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118257093<\/a><br>You shall not make for yourself an idol, or any likeness of what is in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the water under the earth.<br><br>Being then the children of God, we ought not to think that the Divine Nature is like gold or silver or stone, an image formed by the art and thought of man.","time":1490468238,"resto":118243142,"id":"IHQk5XgK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118257345,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)14:57:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"Lord Jesus, I am a sinner.

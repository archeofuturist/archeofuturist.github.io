If you&#039;re on a computer all day, make sure that your monitors are adjusted to a proper height. While there are guides that say that your eye line should line up with the top of the monitor, I find that 1\/3rd the way down leads to better posture over time. Most of the things you do will be in the middle of the bottom of your screen more than the top. If you need to constantly look up all the time, it can be tiring for your head as well. <br><br>Make sure your monitors are further away. This reduces the angle you would have to stare downwards at when you are looking at your screen. <br><br>Also most importantly is your seat. If you&#039;re a shitposting, you sit in your chair most of your waking day. You should get a good chair, or a chair that has good back support. Where I live in Norcal, you can get a used Aeron chair for like 300 bucks, but if you&#039;re elsewhere there are other chairs out there. <br><br>Seat rests are fine for you, but keep in mind that you&#039;ll be tempted to use them more and you might end up being hunched up on them.

If your keyboard is too low, you&#039;ll often have to hunch up to reach it. <br><br>Laptops, cell phones, and tablets are actually terrible for your posture. Because a laptop screen is connected to the keyboard, in order to operate it comfortably with your hands you&#039;ll have to position it pretty low compared to your eye level. This forces your head to bend, and often you&#039;ll end up hunching over to just look at your laptop. <br><br>If you&#039;re using a cell phone while walking, chances are you&#039;re looking down and putting great strain on your neck. Your head is heavy, and looking down at a cell phone all the time is going to fuck your neck up. Worse, your upper back will try to take the strain off a bit, and start to curve. Stop using cell phones all the time while walking, and if using them for a long time try doing it on your back or something in bed instead of bending down to use them. You can also hold them out in front of your face, but you&#039;ll look like a retard. <br><br>The rotation of your shoulders matters quite a bit. Here&#039;s a good way to test your posture. If you stand, and your palms naturally face backwards, that means that your posture is wrong and you have rounded shoulders. Try to do a normal position of having your palms face you. You should be doing this when you&#039;re walking or standing. <br><br>Google stretches for rounded shoulders. What I like to do (that&#039;s doable from a sitting position is to stick my arms straight out to my side, and put my palms up once in a while. This forces the shoulders to rotate back instead of tilting forward, and also forces your chest to come out. This also stretches those muscles so it&#039;ll feel more relaxed being in a neutral position. If you&#039;re sitting, this also forces your spine to be straight somewhat.

Then there are the muscles in your shoulder\/arms. These need to be stretched. Also the legs. It is advisable to try to learn or at least stretch the splits. In a split the leg behind you is having its hip flexor muscles stretched. The hip flexor muscles are very important in a backbend.<br><br>I started by doing cobra stretches on the floor, this focused on the lower back. I did wall stretches where I would reach up the wall and slide my arms down as my back arched and my butt would stick out backwards. You can target different parts of the back this way and also target the shoulders. I also tried to stretch the hip flexors by doing lunge stretches and eventually split training.<br><br>Once I was more advanced I began laying on my stomach and bringing my foot above my head from behind and trying to keep it there. That took a while to achieve. The shoulders\/arms are the most difficult to target and I do so by doing the pose from my earlier post and trying to straighten the legs to put the weight on the arms and thus putting pressure to stretch the arm\/shoulder muscles muscles.<br><br>Essentially for beginners, cobras for lower spine, lunges for hip flexors, wall stretches to try and target the upper back. You have to really feel the spine and feel where it is being stretched. You want to utilize your whole spine, not just one part. Also feel the hip flexor muscles and the muscles in your belly stretch as you do it.<br><br>When you get more advanced more stretching options open up. My goal is to be like one of the contortionists that can do chest stands and bring both of their feet to either side of their head like pic related.","filename":"539w","ext":".jpg","w":539,"h":352,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":81,"tim":1492486485546,"time":1492486485,"md5":"WUMwbZ54vnrSnAJZmoS+FQ==","fsize":19894,"resto":121591667,"id":"lIZykjaG","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121631763,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)23:35:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121614731\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121614731<\/a><br>Not much, I train my running more than I train my upper body.

If you are consistent and relatively healthy and not old you should be able to get to where I am in less than a year, perhaps less than six months if you are really dedicated. Some people have gotten to full blown contortionist in less than a year but you have to be crazy dedicated.<br><br>One thing to know is that in my experience, stretching the back can make you sore. You want to do small stretches almost every day but save your long deepest stretching sessions to once per week or you will not leave enough time to recover and seem to be going backwards in your training. This can be extremely frustrating to experience. <br><br>One of the best resources to go to is contortionistsunite ning com (add dots between the spaces) Lots of people here who know their stuff.

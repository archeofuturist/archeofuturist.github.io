If you&#039;re on a computer all day, make sure that your monitors are adjusted to a proper height. While there are guides that say that your eye line should line up with the top of the monitor, I find that 1\/3rd the way down leads to better posture over time. Most of the things you do will be in the middle of the bottom of your screen more than the top. If you need to constantly look up all the time, it can be tiring for your head as well. <br><br>Make sure your monitors are further away. This reduces the angle you would have to stare downwards at when you are looking at your screen. <br><br>Also most importantly is your seat. If you&#039;re a shitposting, you sit in your chair most of your waking day. You should get a good chair, or a chair that has good back support. Where I live in Norcal, you can get a used Aeron chair for like 300 bucks, but if you&#039;re elsewhere there are other chairs out there. <br><br>Seat rests are fine for you, but keep in mind that you&#039;ll be tempted to use them more and you might end up being hunched up on them.

If your keyboard is too low, you&#039;ll often have to hunch up to reach it. <br><br>Laptops, cell phones, and tablets are actually terrible for your posture. Because a laptop screen is connected to the keyboard, in order to operate it comfortably with your hands you&#039;ll have to position it pretty low compared to your eye level. This forces your head to bend, and often you&#039;ll end up hunching over to just look at your laptop. <br><br>If you&#039;re using a cell phone while walking, chances are you&#039;re looking down and putting great strain on your neck. Your head is heavy, and looking down at a cell phone all the time is going to fuck your neck up. Worse, your upper back will try to take the strain off a bit, and start to curve. Stop using cell phones all the time while walking, and if using them for a long time try doing it on your back or something in bed instead of bending down to use them. You can also hold them out in front of your face, but you&#039;ll look like a retard. <br><br>The rotation of your shoulders matters quite a bit. Here&#039;s a good way to test your posture. If you stand, and your palms naturally face backwards, that means that your posture is wrong and you have rounded shoulders. Try to do a normal position of having your palms face you. You should be doing this when you&#039;re walking or standing. <br><br>Google stretches for rounded shoulders. What I like to do (that&#039;s doable from a sitting position is to stick my arms straight out to my side, and put my palms up once in a while. This forces the shoulders to rotate back instead of tilting forward, and also forces your chest to come out. This also stretches those muscles so it&#039;ll feel more relaxed being in a neutral position. If you&#039;re sitting, this also forces your spine to be straight somewhat.

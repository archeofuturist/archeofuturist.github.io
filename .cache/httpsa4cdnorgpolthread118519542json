We can&#039;t ban or downvote anyone&#039;s post so it becomes spoilered or deleted. The only way to get rid of a post on 4chan is for it to be deleted by the mods -- who don&#039;t even do their jobs in the first place, so that&#039;s not even a threat -- or to let it slide into oblivion -- which autists can&#039;t do because they have to reply to everything.<br><br>What 4chan does is allows anyone of opposing opinions to post, using whatever facts or resources they want without fear of being banned for it. Sure, people may call you mean names and greentext at you, but they can&#039;t ignore the data you put out. Leddit, meanwhile, has the authority to put a neg out on whatever is posted, or shadowban users to the point where there voices can&#039;t be heard at all.<br><br>4chan allows people to post Blacked porn, make Communism threads, talk about the virtues of Islam, and, of course, call Trump the God-Emperor of Mankind. Other sites don&#039;t do that. Other sites don&#039;t allow that. 4chan, by its very nature, is not an echo chamber. We have just gone through all the data, and become heavily Trump-leaning in our opinions because that&#039;s where the facts lead.<br><br>The reason other places, outside of 4chan, are general sewage dumps is because it&#039;s well-known knowledge at this point that any right-leaning sites being made are all controlled by the American Alphabet as a means of tagging and identifying anyone who has contrarian opinions. Even 4chan has been breached and is a honeypot for &quot;potential fascists&quot;. Those sites, being inherently controlled opposition, are automatically trash because they are, for lack of a better definition, &quot;soulless machines&quot; where there is no real spirit or identity for the users. 4chan, meanwhile, has a thirteen and a half year history of people turning it into what it is now.","time":1490627730,"resto":118519542,"id":"C8pG4DcE","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118521756,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)11:16:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118519542\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118519542<\/a><br>we wuz mainstream","filename":"1474923106055","ext":".png","w":1178,"h":940,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":99,"tim":1490627781057,"time":1490627781,"md5":"veowmdYHmKRTIT2Sw\/Z2Hw==","fsize":169780,"resto":118519542,"id":"nijgrOPZ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118522008,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)11:18:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118519542\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118519542<\/a><br><br>No you are losing.

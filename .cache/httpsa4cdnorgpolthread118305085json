You avoid calling it slavery for some strange reason and also assume only Africans fulfilled the role of slavery.<br><br>Even ignoring the simple fact that there were WHITE SLAVES in america (technically indentured servants with an end date for their term of service along with certain rights and privileges. These however actually encouraged the owner to kill them before their term was served in order to avoid giving them certain perks they received at the end of their term.) the fact is that america would still have became the super power it is today, if not even greater.<br><br>For example, a large portion of the american population is people who moved there for the simple purpose of escaping Europe. Be it for religious (various christian sects either left Europe because of persecution, or in the case of puritans, in order to persecute as they wished), political (the Russian migrants of 1916-ish, escaping the rise of communism), economic (the Irish and such) or other such issues.<br><br>Arguably, without slaves from africa, more Europeans would have been brought across as indentured servants to fill the gap. This would have slowed the growth initially (they cost more) but would be balanced by various benefits like a complete lack of any sort of slave revolts (as the indentured servant seeks to join the society around them, they won&#039;t attempt to destroy it) or other such problems.<br><br><br>Then there is your example of the Asian labour coming to build american railways. This is quite possibly your strongest point but still is quite flawed. At the end of the day, the railroads would have been completed, at most a year or two slower. I would point out that things like steam-drills, explosives and such did more to speed up the process than cheap labour and if that was truly what they needed then they could quite easily have gotten it.<br><br><br>(P 1 \/ 2)","time":1490495457,"resto":118305085,"id":"zsPQGHuP","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118308847,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)22:36:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118305085\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118305085<\/a><br>No. Try harder (((Shareblue)))","time":1490495762,"resto":118305085,"id":"5V\/r\/7ux","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118309094,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)22:38:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118305085\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118305085<\/a><br>http:\/\/journals.sagepub.com\/doi\/abs<wbr>\/10.1177\/0003122415577989","time":1490495891,"resto":118305085,"id":"Ra1BuLxD","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118309132,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)22:38:38","name":"T.O.A.N.","com":"<a href=\"#p118305085\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118305085<\/a><br><br>It was never a strength back when this country was exceeding every other nation before it in valor, technology, and exploration.<br><br>So no, it&#039;s not a fucking strength but rather a plot to destroy us.","time":1490495918,"resto":118305085,"id":"GTqCUFgg","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118309226,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)22:39:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118308321\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118308321<\/a><br>Lastly the point of black contributions to musical culture and culture in general.<br><br><br>I would quite like to point out I have a formal education in music, including it&#039;s evolution in the 20th century.

I wanted to gather a consensus on what the average anon considers to be the most damaging aspect to the cohesion of modern society. I believe we are in this stagnant state of &quot;SJWs v. Nazis&quot; because both sides have polarized to the point were the idea of the opposing ideology&#039;s tenets are inconceivable to the other. Once that happens, it&#039;s a slippery slope towards dehumanization, then encouraging violence (Gas the Kikes, Punch a Nazi). Somethings gotta give, but nobody will reach out.

I recently asked some students why they hated Donald Trump, and none of them could give me a straight answer without resorting to &quot;he&#039;s racist!&quot; or &quot;he&#039;s sexist!&quot;. These same people wouldn&#039;t acknowledge that certain media outlets (such as The Guardian or the BBC) have a left-wing bias. They truly believed that British media is 100% neutral and presents facts without bias. These people suck up viewpoints from biased news stations then reinforce these opinions through the tweets or facebook posts they read. Without ever seeing any facts or any arguments with actual substance, they form opinions like &quot;Donald Trump hates black people!&quot; Can&#039;t even be bothered ranting about it, you people have seen the state of the mainstream media today","time":1490486479,"resto":118291205,"id":"F9PEmOHy","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118293423,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)20:09:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118291205\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118291205<\/a><br><br>As someone on one end of the spectrum, the whole meming and insulting has been fun and a good way to express opposition. But lately I&#039;ve started to grow genuinely curious of why people with opposing views think what they think. The reports of Tim Pool in Sweden made me realize that Malmo is not a full-blown war zone at all (although I still firmly believe that Sweden and Europe have problems that will become detrimental later on). I can&#039;t be the only one? If I am not the only one, maybe this is the time to both find some middle ground in our thinking.","time":1490486978,"resto":118291205,"id":"TJvdu2FV","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"}]}

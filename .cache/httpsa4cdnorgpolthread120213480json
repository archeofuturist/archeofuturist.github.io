Traditional thought says that we are what we are and we can actualise ourselves within those bounds only - but you can&#039;t identify those bounds without meeting them. <br><br>I suggest philosophy. Memory you can supplement with notation - read a chapter and summarise it for yourself, write some notes. Not all works are complicated, but even then you can work up to the complicated ones by developing foundations of understanding over time. Try Meditations by Marcus Aurelius.<br><br>External circumstances are not spontaneously going to change, all that can change is your inner orientation and only you can change that.

I feel like five seasons are the right amount for the show, and I&#039;m surprised that, after 13 years off the air, Season 5 has picked up in such a strong way. I also think the move to Adult Swim was great. Watching the first four seasons of Samurai Jack, it&#039;s definitely awesome, but I felt like it was inhibited at times by being on Cartoon Network, meant to be a kid&#039;s show.<br><br>The mature themes that are coming out of Season 5 are more intense than previous seasons, and I love it. I&#039;m not an expert on Saurai Jack because, like I said, I literally just bingewatched it over the weekend. I&#039;m just stating my opinion here, having just gone through all of it. But I feel like Samurai Jack should have had some of those harder-set mature tones from the start.<br><br>I&#039;m not saying the first four seasons were bad or anything. I just really love the current season. I also love how it hasn&#039;t been ruined for once by age and the forces of SJWism that infiltrate reboots.","time":1493184169,"resto":122840987,"id":"6uNArSKw","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122847939,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)01:23:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122847709\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122847709<\/a><br>I can&#039;t believe I&#039;m saying this but the concept of maturity has been co-opted for marketing purposes.<br><br>The only real difference between a kid and an adult is brain and body development, otherwise they can have identical shit taste.","time":1493184183,"resto":122840987,"id":"rfP1KlU3","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122847950,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)01:23:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122847793\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122847793<\/a><br>Too bad it&#039;s only Shinn for the first half, and the rest of the show is Athrun being a hypocritical fucknut that gives his protege horrible advice then tries to murder him for following it.

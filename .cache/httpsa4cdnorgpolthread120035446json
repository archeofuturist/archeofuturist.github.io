Suh told The Post in a phone interview Friday that she later messaged the host to ask if she could add two friends and two puppies to the reservation and was told it would be fine.<br><br>\u201cIf you think 4 people and 2 dogs ate getting a room fir $50 a night on big bear mountain during the busiest weekend of the year ..\u2026 You are insanely high,\u201d the host texted her, according to Suh\u2019s screenshots of the exchange. The host, identified as \u201cTami\u201d in the images, also called Suh \u201ca con artist\u201d and canceled the reservation.<br><br>Suh said she was shocked, then protested, telling the host that she had screenshots of their earlier messages showing she had agreed to the reservation changes.<br><br>\u201cGo ahead. I wouldn\u2019t rent to u if you were the last person on earth,\u201d the host wrote back to Suh. \u201cOne word says it all. Asian\u201d<br><br>When Suh replied that she would report the host to Airbnb for being racist, the host told her to \u201cGo ahead\u201d and \u201cIt\u2019s why we have trump.\u201d<br><br>\u201cAnd I will not allow this country to be told what to do by foreigners,\u201d the host added.<br><br>Suh said in the video that she has been living in the United States since she was 3 years old. She currently is enrolled in the Critical Race Studies Program at the UCLA School of Law.<br><br>\u201cI\u2019m an American citizen. This is my home,\u201d Suh said in the video. \u201cIt stings. It stings that after living in the U.S. for over 23 years, this is what happens.\u201d<br><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/nuZn8iVQbSc","filename":"Screen Shot 2017-04-07 at 6.16.38 PM","ext":".png","w":1940,"h":1330,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":171,"tim":1491603774504,"time":1491603774,"md5":"n0hFLIupu\/2ZqPCieMDUrA==","fsize":1524576,"resto":0,"id":"bQUL1LHN","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"one-word-says-it-all-asian-airbnb-host-banned-for","country_name":"United States","replies":29,"images":18,"unique_ips":16},{"no":120035783,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)18:25:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120035446\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120035446<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Critical Race Studies Program at UCLA School of Law<\/span><br><br>This is too perfect not to be falsified.","time":1491603902,"resto":120035446,"id":"yQ0Gcge2","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120035996,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)18:26:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120035446\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120035446<\/a>","filename":"airbnb2","ext":".jpg","w":720,"h":1280,"tn_w":70,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491603978054,"time":1491603978,"md5":"N6qqw6U7mN64F2reKXou4w==","fsize":67250,"resto":120035446,"id":"bQUL1LHN","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":120036403,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)18:28:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;325 posts by this ID<\/span>","time":1491604135,"resto":120035446,"id":"jy1O\/rZB","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120036640,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)18:30:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120035446\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120035446<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;$50 a night for 4 people and 2 dogs<\/span><br><br>Asian bitch should have been decked in the teeth for even thinking of such a thing.","time":1491604222,"resto":120035446,"id":"Txsvryye","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120036754,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)18:31:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120036640\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120036640<\/a><br>Yeah without hearing the owner&#039;s side of the story I wonder how much of this was her refusing to pay more for adding 2 people and 2 dogs on.","time":1491604272,"resto":120035446,"id":"bQUL1LHN","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120036874,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)18:31:49","name":"Bard of \/Pol\/","com":"<a href=\"#p120035446\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120035446<\/a><br><a href=\"#p120036640\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120036640<\/a><br><br>to be fair, those 2 dogs are there to feed the four Asians.","filename":"1488379923934","ext":".jpg","w":394,"h":370,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":117,"tim":1491604309113,"time":1491604309,"md5":"xDmy8EW\/bNLsb+aU7Cp2SQ==","fsize":24516,"resto":120035446,"id":"tF7f04NM","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":120036925,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)18:32:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120035996\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120035996<\/a>","filename":"hqdefault[1]","ext":".jpg","w":480,"h":360,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1491604330646,"time":1491604330,"md5":"2w465IxLUOaSlg0PjtLoUQ==","fsize":14643,"resto":120035446,"id":"sP3yEz6n","country":"DK","country_name":"Denmark"},{"no":120036998,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)18:32:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"don&#039;t gorget <br><br>This is how she actually looks like","filename":"image","ext":".jpg","w":1080,"h":1315,"tn_w":102,"tn_h":124,"tim":1491604358647,"time":1491604358,"md5":"CiNljtLOyKaYwpsxedSiHQ==","fsize":156819,"resto":120035446,"id":"Ioq5o73r","country":"GB","m_img":1,"country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120037066,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)18:33:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120036925\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120036925<\/a><br>STOP CONDONE RACISM","filename":"image","ext":".jpg","w":284,"h":177,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":77,"tim":1491604391266,"time":1491604391,"md5":"iE\/vgw53WLU\/ytj2w9OHNA==","fsize":11065,"resto":120035446,"id":"Ioq5o73r","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120037143,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)18:33:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120036754\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120036754<\/a><br>I SMOTE YOU BY ALLAH<br><br>\u02bfIlm al-Kal\u0101m (Arabic: \u0639\u0644\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0644\u0627\u0645) is the philosophy that seeks Islamic theological principles through dialectic.

From the 9th century onward, due to Caliph al-Ma&#039;mun and his successor, ancient Greek philosophy was introduced among the arabs and the Peripatetic School began to find able representatives. Among them were Al-Kindi, Al-Farabi, Avicenna and Averroes. Another trend, represented by the Brethren of Purity, used Aristotelian language to expound a fundamentally Neoplatonic and Neopythagorean world view.<br><br>During the Abbasid caliphate, a number of thinkers and scientists, some of them heterodox Muslims or non-Muslims, played a role in transmitting Greek, Hindu and other pre-Islamic knowledge to the Christian West. They contributed to making Aristotle known in Christian Europe.

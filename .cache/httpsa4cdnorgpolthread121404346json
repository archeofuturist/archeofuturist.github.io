They simply don&#039;t quite understand, <br>what this is about. Many good people think that it is about Donald Trump <br>as the Don Quixote with the wooden spear going after the deep <br>state establishment, the evil ? that have had hijacked America since <br>at least the 1970s, even further back maybe, and some see Donald <br>Trump as saint on a white horse or lone ranger or whatever, who was <br>going to slay all those dragons. <br><br>What I maintain since well before the elections is that Trump is a project, <br>he is not a physical thinking being like John Kennedy or even Richard <br>Nixon or others who have been POTUS, George Eisenhower \u2013 <br>these are not presidents whos agenda I entirely agree with by any means, <br>but these were at least people where you would say: \u201eOk, at least <br>I can understand why he is POTUS, the world&#039;s greatest power, <br>because he was commander in chief of the US forces during WW 2, <br>or he was president of Columbia university, or was senator of the <br>US, with forays into global politics, whatever.\u201c","filename":"160518-trump-portrait-jsw-145p_1c226e6636be4572928409c157f0d50a.nbcnews-ux-2880-1000","ext":".jpg","w":1572,"h":1000,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":159,"tim":1492372550514,"time":1492372550,"md5":"d3YAtQ6xOwyRcVVf2y8MgQ==","fsize":91460,"resto":0,"id":"szlO+svN","country":"AT","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"trump-is-a-project-a-sincere-analysis","country_name":"Austria","replies":5,"images":1,"unique_ips":3},{"no":121404618,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)15:57:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121404346\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121404346<\/a><br>With Donald Trump you got a mafiosi real estate mogul, whos <br>background is gambling casinos with some of the dirtiest money <br>laundering figures of the planet, like Sheldon Adelson and others, <br>and his qualifications to become president are only, that for the <br>patriarchy I call them, <br>the David Rockefellers \u2013 Soros pretends to be in the opposition to <br>Trump \u2013 it&#039;s all a game \u2013 In my view, the Trump presidency is perfect, <br>because as Henry Kissinger said: he is a tabula rasa, he is a blank slate, <br>nobody knows, what he is gonna do, so we can make of him anywhing, <br>we want to: he doesn&#039;t carry baggage of a democratic party, the <br>doesn&#039;t carry baggage of a John McCain republican party \u2013 he is what <br>we want to make him.<br><br>I think we have to go a level deeper and say: \u201eOk, what is the dominating <br>power in the USA?\u201c It are these patriarchies, american oligarchs, who <br>have the idea, that they own us, and they own the nation and they own <br>all the ressources, and the whole world, and I&#039;d call them psychopathic, <br>because they don&#039;t.

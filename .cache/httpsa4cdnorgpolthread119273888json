The absolute number one thing to never allow is letting Priests marry. There is a very good reason for this. Look at the incredibly high rates of deviancy and mental illness in children of Lawyers, Judges, Politicians, and Preachers. As the child grows up and develops, he receives the social law through the father. When the father is also one of society&#039;s law-givers, the effect on the child is compounded.<br><br>If the Priest\/Judge\/General father makes one mistake, has an affair, gets abusive, divorce, whatever, this RUINS the child&#039;s perception of the Law and the Father. Personal family stuff that happens that wouldn&#039;t be common knowledge among the rest of the people who receive the law from the father is intimately known by the child who then must resolve the conflict in his worldview. My Father gives the law, but he is also a lawbreaker, so the law must be worthless, my father must be a hypocrite.<br><br>So now the son of the law giver becomes an anarchist, turns to crime and degeneracy, and is either disowned or abandons the family. And the rest of the society sees that the law giver&#039;s family has fallen apart. Thus the society itself turns away from the law.<br><br>All because you let priests get married and have kids. This leads to the end of the Church. This is why Protestantism is a direct path to social Atheism. Everyone fucks up, but when the Law Giver with a family fucks up, it ruins his family and the ruin of his family ruins the Church.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;But Muslim clerics get married, with multiple wives<\/span><br><br>And they&#039;re able to get away with this because the resulting sexual deviancy is either just ignored or normalized (sex with slaves, sex with pubescents, young boys, or goats) or is punished by death. So when the law giver betrays the law in the Muslim society, he is just executed and the law is upheld rather than the faith being abandoned by society.","time":1491191551,"resto":119273888,"id":"8oTMDH9S","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119287360,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)23:55:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119287046\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119287046<\/a><br>Yeah I wanna listen to a whole hour of some faggot who parrots the same shit fedoras do but is too retarded to realize he&#039;s a living caricature to kill himself.","time":1491191735,"resto":119273888,"id":"c0VlgNNe","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119287823,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)00:00:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"Not going to lie, my Grandpa was Russian Orthodox.

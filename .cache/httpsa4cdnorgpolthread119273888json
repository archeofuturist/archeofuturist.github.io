Fix the aesthetics like you said, make it inspiring once again. Bring back gothic cathethrals in all their glory.<br><br>2. Stop trying to preach the bible as literal fact, it makes the religion look fucking retarded and it was never really taken that way in the past. Genesis isn&#039;t fact, but it was never meant to be taken that way. At the same time stop compromising with Islam<br><br>3. Allow priests to marry. Sure keep it only men (which I think is a good idea) and no gays, but not allowing marriage is killing the religion in many ways. A vow of celibacy should be an optional thing and venerated, but not compulsory as it sends a terrible message.","time":1491190563,"resto":119273888,"id":"50rmM\/4P","country":"NZ","country_name":"New Zealand"},{"no":119285722,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)23:37:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119285176\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119285176<\/a><br>Give him some credit, he&#039;s actually trying to use apologetics against Orthodoxy, which Evangelicals are hilariously bad and ignorant about.<br><br>Not surprised he went with, &quot;LOL They&#039;re just Catholics WHORE OF BABYLON!&quot;","time":1491190643,"resto":119273888,"id":"c0VlgNNe","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119285790,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)23:38:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119273888\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119273888<\/a><br>DIGITS<br><br>https:\/\/discord.gg\/KyhHe5M","filename":"duesvult","ext":".png","w":600,"h":860,"tn_w":87,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491190694690,"time":1491190694,"md5":"v6EySDhZHL16RyhDKj1x6w==","fsize":323072,"resto":119273888,"id":"aCCf+Uv+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119285856,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)23:39:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119285593\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119285593<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Stop trying to preach the bible as literal fact,<\/span><br>What kind of Crypto-Evangelical Catholic Church have you gone to?","time":1491190740,"resto":119273888,"id":"c0VlgNNe","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119285943,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)23:39:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119283050\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119283050<\/a><br>thanks","time":1491190798,"resto":119273888,"id":"8TP0P3oP","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":119286054,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)23:41:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119283852\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119283852<\/a><br><br>Well out of curiosity what church do you belong to","time":1491190870,"resto":119273888,"id":"SwBAmq9S","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119286180,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)23:42:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119273888\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119273888<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; you will never be orthodox<\/span>","filename":"9a60sm","ext":".jpg","w":221,"h":276,"tn_w":100,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491190960970,"time":1491190960,"md5":"03DNjfWWvw1+QUF4klOtjg==","fsize":11516,"resto":119273888,"id":"zCml17rq","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

Unveiled late last year, the package attracted widespread criticism for pushing the concept of \u201cmale privilege\u201d and \u201chegemonic masculinity\u201d into classrooms, and for failing to consider the multiple, complex drivers of family violence, which also has an impact on men and boys.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;last week a &quot;transwoman&quot; won a Women&#039;s Weight-Lifting competition in Australia<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;now this<\/span><br><br>What the fuck happened to the &quot;badass no-nonsense Australians hunting crocodiles, punching kangaroos &#039;n shiiiiet &quot;?

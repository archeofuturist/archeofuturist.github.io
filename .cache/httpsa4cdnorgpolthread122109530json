Everytime someone fires a gun somewhere \/pol\/ gets spammed with &quot;omg there&#039;ll be war&quot; threads.

You were cutting those for decades, because your own generals thought that after the cold war the only thing European soldiers will ever be doing is building gender equal schools in thirld world shitholes as &quot;peacekeeping&quot;.<br><br>Third of all Trump is really pushing European allies to defend themselves because he&#039;s focusing on China and East Asia and the US is weaker than it was due to losing in Iraq and Afghanistan. Some Euro-establishment are enthusiastic about it because they always liked the idea of less Americans on the continent and a buildup could get domestic arms industry going.<br><br>It all doesn&#039;t even matter because your government thought a million &quot;refugees&quot; a year are just grand, your politicians think your borders don&#039;t exist and your intellectuals want to abolish the German people as some grand new progressive revolutiuon. No the AfD is not coming, you will get at least 4 more years of Merkel Groko.","filename":"#refugeeswelcome","ext":".jpg","w":275,"h":183,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1492760118371,"time":1492760118,"md5":"H+YxDNdo6vy1EhLWyHJUhg==","fsize":10193,"resto":122109530,"id":"wMk3fCzT","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"}]}

However, I travel for work and have stayed in multiple states since graduating from U of I.. <br>Living in other states has really disillusioned me on living in the state of Illinois. Taxes are ridiculous and getting worse, and it&#039;s all because of Chicago. I&#039;m from southern Illinois and really tired of how much their politics (idiocracy) affects the rest of us. <br><br>I think people in New York State feel similarly about NYC??<br><br>Now crap like this from Rahm Emanuel? What a slap in the face upon an already failed city. I&#039;m not even going to cite statistics here, why waste my time? There will be 25 more shootings today.<br>What do you guys think about this bullshit?

Have you ever considered that someone who is falsely accused would probably like to be out of prison more than they would like to see their false accuser in prison? Getting the falsely accused out of prison should be your first priority. Charging women for confessing false accusations will ensure that the falsely accused stay in prison because no one will ever recant their lies.","time":1493779794,"resto":123837883,"id":"BJ2iZj7+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123860774,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)22:51:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123837883\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123837883<\/a><br>put her in a men&#039;s prison. show her the true meaning of sexual assault.","time":1493779860,"resto":123837883,"id":"MTcsXqP0","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123860968,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)22:52:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123860672\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123860672<\/a><br>I wonder if this guy will kill her and then suicide.

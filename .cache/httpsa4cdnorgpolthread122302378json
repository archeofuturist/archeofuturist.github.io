The &quot;50 State Strategy&quot; was born in 2005, to basically force the DNC to spend huge in ALL 50 states and to field candidates in ALL House\/Senate races, no matter what. In general, the DNC are lazy shits who allow 80-90 House races to go uncontested, meaning the Republican candidate runs unopposed and as such, ALWAYS gets re-elected. Also in the Senate, only the big name Senate Democrats or those who are connected with the higher ups, get money\/support from the DNC. Most states, when Senate elections come up, are ignored and either the DNC doesn&#039;t run anyone or whoever does run, is not given any funds or support from the DNC, meaning the Democrat running has to fund his own campaign and tend to get slaughtered by the Republican candidate, who has access to RNC coffers (letting them outspend the Democrat challenger) and RNC machine (meaning you can get big named Republicans to help campaign against the Democrat and have access to resources to help you massacre them). <br><br>Dean&#039;s &quot;50 State Strategy&quot; is WHY Democrats were able to reclaim Congress from Republicans in 2006 and how they were able to deliver Obama a veto proof majority in his first two years in office. But Obama did not give a shit about it, one iota. <br><br>He fired Dean as head of DNC, because of his own backroom deal with Hillary: Hillary wanted her own people in charge of the DNC so they could wholesale rig the primaries when Hillary ran in 2016 so that she would be the nominee.","time":1492883536,"resto":122302378,"id":"P56MtIXE","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122304683,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)13:52:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122302626\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122302626<\/a><br>The &quot;win&quot; is that instead of Poles you&#039;ll get more Pakis.","time":1492883538,"resto":122302378,"id":"oqFmT\/d0","country":"HU","country_name":"Hungary"},{"no":122304753,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)13:52:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122302378\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122302378<\/a><br>They keep insisting Hilly won","time":1492883570,"resto":122302378,"id":"vnu3de64","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122304872,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)13:53:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122304676\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122304676<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;Continue<\/span><br><br>Like Obama, Hillary didn&#039;t give a shit about the &quot;50 State Strategy&quot; and Howard Dean was bought off to make sure he said nothing as they wholesale dismantled the strategy, meaning Democrats lost their majority and later BOTH houses of Congress and state-level government.

So it means that the DNC is, in theory, going to throw all sorts of money into these sorts of races, in hopes that they can slowly reclaim control over Congress and state governments in hopes of reclaiming the House in 2018, since the Senate is out of reach but the House is possibly obtainable in terms of winning back","time":1492883623,"resto":122302378,"id":"P56MtIXE","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122305224,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)13:56:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122302378\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122302378<\/a><br><br>They ran a 30 something millenial Jewish hipster in a Republican stronghold because they couldn&#039;t find a white christian boy cut of the peanut farmer Jimmy Carter cloth to run there.<br><br>They&#039;re fucked.

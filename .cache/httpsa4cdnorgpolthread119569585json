The report defines gender minorities as those who identify as lesbian, gay or bisexual as well as those who \u201creport sexual or romantic attractions to those of the same-sex but do not identify as LGB.\u201d<br><br>The report found striking differences in the breakdown of incarcerated boys and girls identified as queer. A survey conducted for the report determined 39.4 percent of girls in juvenile corrections facilities identify as LGB, with an additional 18.5 percent identifying as \u201cmostly straight,\u201d compared to just 3.2 percent of boys who identify as gay or bisexual, with an additional 3.9 percent who self-identify as \u201cmostly straight.\u201d Boys make up a much higher percentage of incarcerated youths. In total, the study found 6.5 percent of all youth in custody identify as LGB, and the number jumps to 11.8 percent when those who describe themselves as \u201cmostly straight\u201d get added to that group.<br><br>A recent study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests nearly 12 of high school girls are lesbian, gay or bisexual compared to 4.5 percent of boys.<br><br>And while in custody, LGB youth are more likely to be sexually victimized. \u201cReports of sexual victimization by staff were lower for girls than boys and varied from 2.2 percent for straight girls to 15.1 percent for gay\/bisexual boys. Youth-perpetrated sexual assaults and injury were the most commonly victimization experienced across all population subgroups. Sexual victimization by other youth using force varied from 1.9 percent for straight boys to 20.6 percent for gay\/bisexual boys.\u201d<br><br>--<br>Pic Unrelated","filename":"HaroldShipman","ext":".jpg","w":610,"h":429,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":175,"tim":1491368461813,"time":1491368461,"md5":"XbOxPEQZAQ0hjBJEP+Au7g==","fsize":42585,"resto":0,"id":"46Y\/wtV\/","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"40-of-women-in-juvie-are-gay-20-of-male-gay","country_name":"United States","replies":4,"images":1,"unique_ips":5},{"no":119569921,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)01:04:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"Dysfunction begets dysfunction - I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll find that many inmates suffer from other mental illnesses as well. <br><br>The liberals will blame this on homophobia just as they blame racism whenever niggers commit atrocities. <br><br>Fun fact - homosexuals are also radically over-represented in the form of serial killers.","filename":"1479433474296","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":392,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":98,"tim":1491368688441,"time":1491368688,"md5":"xYbEQ+MGrqPyC6amgyODxw==","fsize":92917,"resto":119569585,"id":"bu7Em+\/s","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119570244,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)01:08:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119569585\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119569585<\/a><br>What does Harold Shipman have to do with this?","time":1491368909,"resto":119569585,"id":"IBoPxVhr","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"},{"no":119570245,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)01:08:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119569585\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119569585<\/a><br>bump","time":1491368911,"resto":119569585,"id":"0g3PcOj9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119570679,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)01:13:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119569585\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119569585<\/a><br>100% of women are bisexual.

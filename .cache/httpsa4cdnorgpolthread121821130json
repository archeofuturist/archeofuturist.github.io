The numbers:<br><br>Le Pen - 25%<br>Melenchon - 21.7%<br>Macron - 21.0%<br>Fillon - 20.2%<br>Hamon - 5.2%<br><br>Shut up an trust me on that. I will be right. Le Pen historically always overperforms her polls unless there is another credible right wing candidate for her votes to go to. There isn&#039;t. I have used a variety of other methods to calculate the other numbers; to be very brief, always remember that Macron&#039;s base is FRAGILE (1\/3 of voters could change minds) and is attracted to Melenchon&#039;s base, where as Fillon has stalled because of Penelopegate, and there is no reason to vote for Hamon as Melenchon becomes the candidate for the Left. <br><br>2nd Round will be 51.43% for Le Pen and 48.51% for Melenchon. Polls after the first round will show roughly a 54\/46 race, favouring Melenchon. <br><br>The crucial moment will come when Fillon ENDORSES Le Pen (or several prominent members of his party). Why would he\/they do that, you ask? Because they support Le Pen AGAINST the commie Melenchon (he wants 100% tax on rich). ALSO, they will have a parliamentary majority, and want to get shit done. THEY CAN GET SHIT DONE WITH LE PEN, BUT NOT WITH MELENCHON. This is crucial to remember.<br><br>This will be the FINAL BLOW. Currently (((polls))) predict the abstention rates of Fillon supporters in a 2nd round Le Pen\/Melenchon to be approximately 50%. (i.e. 50% do not vote at all). Fillon\/his party&#039;s endorsement of Le Pen will reduce this rate to approximately 30%, which results in the 51.43% victory I described above. So, add all these factors in and Le Pen will Make France Great Again. I&#039;m waiting, \/pol\/. Shortly, you will see that I was right.","filename":"presidentlepen","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":720,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1492589938472,"time":1492589938,"md5":"df5FUFBiXd\/yCZVKj6QXiw==","fsize":110927,"resto":0,"id":"KxqN++CX","country":"AU","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"le-pen-will-win-guaranteed-i-explain-how","country_name":"Australia","replies":66,"images":18,"unique_ips":31},{"no":121821505,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)04:25:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121821130\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121821130<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Fillon ENDORSES Le Pen<\/span><br>kek<br>go back fucking your kangaroos instead of writing bullshit<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;inb4 swiss FIDF<\/span>","time":1492590311,"resto":121821130,"id":"PMikbntM","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":121821592,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)04:26:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121821505\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121821505<\/a><br>Why wouldn&#039;t it happen, jackass?

Let&#039;s take a look at current (((polling))), for whatever it&#039;s worth. The most recent poll has Le Pen at 43%, and Melenchon at 57%.<br><br>First, its important to note that this gap is declining daily (look at polling aggregates) as voters increasingly become aware of Melenchon&#039;s communist platform and its dangers. So, where is Le Pen falling short?<br><br>Surprisingly, the answer is the turnout of right wing voters. At most, according to polls, 10% of conservative voters will vote for the commie against Le Pen. 10%. Most, and we can basically assume almost all, will either not vote, or vote for Le Pen to block the commie. So how many are not voting (abstaining)?<br><br>Polls suggest that number to be roughly 50% at the moment, where as Macron&#039;s abstention rate can be as low as 30%, and most of his supporters are not excited to vote for Melenchon against Le Pen, but they are holding their noses anyway.<br><br>My argument is simple. Fillon, or some part of his party will endorse a vote against Melenchon because of this <a href=\"#p121823184\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121823184<\/a>. All Le Pen needs to do to win is reduce that abstention rate in the right wing, and will a Republican tepid endorsement, it is ABSOLUTELY possible. One aspect of Fillon voters is how intensely loyal polls show them to be - they will literally do whatever Fillon says. An endorsement against Melenchon WILL reduce the abstention rate. And my calcuations say they only need to reduce the abstention rate by 15% amongst right wing voters for Le Pen to win.<br><br>I think its not only achievable - I think it is likely.","time":1492593622,"resto":121821130,"id":"KxqN++CX","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":121825058,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)05:20:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121824707\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121824707<\/a><br>AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;THERE IS NO FUTURE FOR FRANCE WITHOUT NORTH AFRICAN PEOPLE&quot;<\/span><br>SIGNED MELANCHON<br><br>\/pol\/ IS NOT YOUR HOME MELANSHILL","time":1492593659,"resto":121821130,"id":"ESGLj8An","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":121825079,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)05:21:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121821130\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121821130<\/a><br>Wow, I hope this is true.

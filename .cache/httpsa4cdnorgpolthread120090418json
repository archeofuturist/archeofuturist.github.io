In fact, the cost\/benefit ratio of going to college is already so out of whack that the whole system has to change radically. A college degree, even now, is of only marginal value; most everybody has one. And things that everybody has are devalued. You\u2019re quite correct that colleges and universities today are dead ducks as businesses. Unless you\u2019re going to learn a trade, like doctoring or lawyering, or you\u2019re going for science, engineering, or math, where you need the formal discipline and where you need lab courses, it\u2019s a total misallocation, even a waste of money to go to college today.<\/span>","time":1491628274,"resto":120090418,"id":"v29B6bWw","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120090761,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)01:11:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"I didn&#039;t get in?","filename":"youtu.be-Qg4NBOIbwXc","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":720,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1491628310882,"time":1491628310,"md5":"+P3PT+i9iep2B8b+VzPSJA==","fsize":46629,"resto":120090418,"id":"IkNXv9TQ","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":120090809,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)01:12:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120090418\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120090418<\/a><br>didnt this guy have like a 4.0 and a 2400+ on his SATs, and an internship with hilary clinton? he could&#039;ve wiped his ass with the application essay and still got in with those credentials","time":1491628338,"resto":120090418,"id":"kHo0LLjg","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120090900,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)01:13:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"most colleges have become nothing more than safe spaces and a day care for adult children.","filename":"dfdg","ext":".jpg","w":467,"h":605,"tn_w":96,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491628388330,"time":1491628388,"md5":"5ZIg8sUyWW5CAWpA0Uw2Bw==","fsize":61010,"resto":120090418,"id":"bOFzZSkH","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

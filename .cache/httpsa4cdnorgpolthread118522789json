She has a great sense of humor and is pretty easy going when it comes to almost everything except for one thing. <br><br>We&#039;ve had a couple of discussions on the refugee crisis and I have the stance that it&#039;s incredibly mishandled and open boarder policies don&#039;t work as long as Islam is as archaic as it is.<br><br>She says that we &quot;owe&quot; the refugees our protection because the west continuously bombed the middle east.<br><br>I already explained that Germany wasn&#039;t even involved in most middle eastern conflicts and that those places were war-zones way before western interference. Some of the countries people &quot;flee&quot; from aren&#039;t even war-zones. Their living conditions are below western standards and that&#039;s why economic migration seems to be the preferable option.<br><br>She won&#039;t budge and insists that all the things I&#039;ve mentioned are also an indirect result of western interference (ex. Germany benefits economically from the plight of people in the east so they are just as responsible for their problems) <br><br>What should I do? Keep in mind that she has a great ass.","filename":"1479488029940","ext":".jpg","w":1538,"h":2048,"tn_w":187,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490628391417,"time":1490628391,"md5":"o1g6iP7HHtVcbpwIzM4xqA==","fsize":446255,"resto":0,"id":"qYHPYF48","country":"DE","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"so-im-in-a-relationship-with-this-girl-she-has-a","country_name":"Germany","replies":23,"images":2,"unique_ips":21},{"no":118523064,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)11:29:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"Keep pushing the Germany didn&#039;t involve in the conflict aspect.

I come here occasionally for Kek and racist memes against niggers and muslims. But now I&#039;m starting to pay attention to all this Shadow Gov stuff and Lobbies and this Globalism matter (thank to your fucking redpills).<br><br>So, my question is: why the Globalism? Why they want the race mixing so hard? Why all this &quot;racism and white privilege&quot;? What they could gain from the gender theory and the SJW movement? It&#039;s only a matter of money? If money are the only real goal why they don&#039;t put all their bets on ppl like us (working white or black ppl with good ideas, ppl who aren&#039;t just crying babies on social networks)? Why they keep supporting SJW, unskilled teens who put all their lives on a blog and retarded people like them? This is just driving me crazy.","filename":"17458073_614094978794547_2285031251774310673_n","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":571,"tn_w":218,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490570273190,"time":1490570273,"md5":"gCmvKOw8KOKq2atL5gx\/Rg==","fsize":37566,"resto":0,"id":"wcQ954Ii","country":"IT","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"i-have-a-question-for-you-and-this-doubt-is-under","country_name":"Italy","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

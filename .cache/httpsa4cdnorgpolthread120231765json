Let us not despair of renewing grace for the conversion of the greatest sinners, nor let such despair of the pardoning mercy of God for the greatest sin. It is a signal token of Divine favour, if God, by the inward working of his grace, or the outward events of his providence, stops us from prosecuting or executing sinful purposes. Saul saw that Just One, ch. 22:14; 26:13. How near to us is the unseen world! It is but for God to draw aside the veil, and objects are presented to the view, compared with which, whatever is most admired on earth is mean and contemptible. Saul submitted without reserve, desirous to know what the Lord Jesus would have him to do. Christ&#039;s discoveries of himself to poor souls are humbling; they lay them very low, in mean thoughts of themselves. For three days Saul took no food, and it pleased God to leave him for that time without relief. His sins were now set in order before him; he was in the dark concerning his own spiritual state, and wounded in spirit for sin. When a sinner is brought to a proper sense of his own state and conduct, he will cast himself wholly on the mercy of the Saviour, asking what he would have him to do. God will direct the humbled sinner, and though he does not often bring transgressors to joy and peace in believing, without sorrows and distress of conscience, under which the soul is deeply engaged as to eternal things, yet happy are those who sow in tears, for they shall reap in joy.","filename":"1346258797657","ext":".jpg","w":1727,"h":1426,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":206,"tim":1491709134352,"time":1491709134,"md5":"N2cPbqq5CUg09zzLL1b96A==","fsize":308976,"resto":0,"id":"oqWz+Z0I","country":"CA","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"road-to-damascus-moment-trump-the-apostle-edition","country_name":"Canada","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

They had me baptized at 12 years old but I&#039;ve never done it of MY own free will. It was because my parents felt it was necessary. It was a Methodist church who did it and they don&#039;t do second baptisms. I also have no interest in joining any church because I&#039;ve seen for myself they teach doctrines that just aren&#039;t biblical at all. <br>Another reason I want to do this is because I&#039;m ready to start being the real deal. I will admit I&#039;ve been a lukewarm Christian at best and I&#039;m seeing the world the way it is these days and people really need to see us owning up to what we preach. They see degeneracy and sick shit all day long and where have we been? I&#039;m ready to start actually practicing my religion now. I don&#039;t want to be like the majority of &quot;Christians&quot; I see who are in it just for the label and hope for a ride up to the kingdom just to save their own asses. <br><br>So who or what church will do this for me without me having to join their church?","filename":"Baptism-of-Christ","ext":".jpg","w":576,"h":720,"tn_w":200,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493190450429,"time":1493190450,"md5":"6wk2Bd\/hqUf9se95QnMJhw==","fsize":149957,"resto":0,"id":"n\/qvophw","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"baptism","country_name":"United States","replies":7,"images":0,"unique_ips":5},{"no":122857208,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)03:12:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"Go to your local baptist church.

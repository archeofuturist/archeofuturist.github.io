In the country you see in the pic (whatever shithole that is) there is probably not a single member of the government or any official figure working for the state, who believes in his country or gives a shit about it. Cucks always complain about colonialism for a reason, but they always forget the second crucial part of it. This part is the fact that some poor fucker who managed to get out of the pool of shit that is average life in those countries will bite and tear at every finger reached out to him. He will drain state funds, pay off the law, fuck over commoners for a quick buck and he will get away with it, because his fellow new &quot;aristocrats&quot; in this country are vultures like he is. You can not give some underdeveloped country advanced technology, political structures and ressources and expect those people to be civil with each other after you leave. It is like expecting little children to be responsible after you leave them alone for the first time. The west had a series of extremely bloody wars leading up to their current state and they only developed one step at a time.<br> Third-worlders basically overdosed on their new possibilities and the only doctor around left. Now you see them dying from it.<br><br> I am only speaking about absolute poverty here obviously, because that is what your image implied.","time":1492521640,"resto":121679628,"id":"ZqmC1aOI","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":121683882,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)09:22:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121679628\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121679628<\/a><br>jewish banks","time":1492521723,"resto":121679628,"id":"GuyzH7zA","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":121684204,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)09:25:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121679628\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121679628<\/a><br>Top 1% plucking the chickens.

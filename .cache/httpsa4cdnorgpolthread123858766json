Growing up my dad was a cuck and never taught me to hunt and didn&#039;t put me in boxing or anything like that, so I never learned how to fight or how to tolerate the sight of injuries and blood.<br><br>To this day whenever I see someone with a nosebleed or something it makes me want to vomit. The thought of getting stabbed or even seeing someone get stabbed makes me visibly shudder, and while I&#039;ve never really had a problem with the thought of fighting someone, I try to avoid all physical altercations as much as possible, going so far as to probably seem beta as fuck to most people.<br><br>So how do I get over these? You&#039;re not really a man if you aren&#039;t at least capable of warfare, hunting, and survival, and my track record shows that I would probably crack in any kind of a stressful situation with blood and bodily harm all around me.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;tl;dr<\/span><br>My dad was a faggot and didn&#039;t raise me to be a man, how do I stop being a spineless coward who vomits at the sight of blood?","filename":"1477878595872","ext":".jpg","w":960,"h":952,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":247,"tim":1493778743152,"time":1493778743,"md5":"fH8ZUxyqHFgrDnIkAi2PQA==","fsize":230403,"resto":0,"id":"j9UjPZdG","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"how-do-i-stop-being-a-coward","country_name":"United States","replies":9,"images":1,"unique_ips":5},{"no":123859536,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)22:39:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123858766\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123858766<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;How do I stop being a coward?<\/span><br>Buy a gun.","time":1493779150,"resto":123858766,"id":"qoq6ee1+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123859557,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)22:39:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"At least you had a dad","time":1493779162,"resto":123858766,"id":"DCGCXlnG","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123859687,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)22:40:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123859536\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123859536<\/a><br>I have a gun.

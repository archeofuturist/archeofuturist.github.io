But as they are a consulting company I dont have any direct access to HR or any shit like that and this work involves trips that have physical discomfort and hazards and extreme overtime. Something they did not mention. They say after a year you can switch etc. But I can tell company culture sucks and its gonna be a gamble to find a good assignment. Their overtime structure is whacked out because they follow some formula that has weekly pay\/hours overtime for hourly. For example I worked 32 hours of overtime one week and got oaid 8.25 and hour, next week I worked 38 and got aroud 7.50. Fuck that shit fuck this company.

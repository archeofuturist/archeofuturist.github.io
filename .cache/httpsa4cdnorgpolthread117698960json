They have not advanced, and have stagnated over the decades due to a floundering economy. The only tricks they have up their sleeves is reliable launch vehicle designs (which they are getting worse at making), and titanium alloys that we have yet to reproduce (in America) because everyone involved is dead, and they are state secrets of the highest level over in Russia. <br><br>Third, rockets are the most complex machines built - ever. The LHC is the most complex machine ever built, but rockets are built en mass and have to do insane things to function. The Saturn 5 for instance was made up of over 3 million individual parts. All of which had to withstand the astronomical (literally) power produced by the machine upon launch and its ascent. <br><br>This has not changed, every rocket ever designed uses well over a million parts, each one is a bespoke device, and even the Shuttle program (after 25 years of use) was only able to get the potential failure odds down to 1 in 15. The Saturn 5 had a 1 in 4 chance to detonate every time it was used due to how insanely complex they were. <br><br>Rockets blow up now because we are applying new techniques to them, or because a single piece of equipment in those over a million separate pieces failed. Yes, a single point of failure on a rocket is enough to cause an RUD. This will always be the case due to the science behind them. <br><br>In the two SpaceX detonations, the first one was because of a fault in production by a 3rd party manufacturer, and the second was an unknown consequence of their new fueling procedure combined with the carbon fiber interior of the rocket. <br><br>You simply cannot know everything, and rockets will always blow up.

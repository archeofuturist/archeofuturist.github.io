They have not advanced, and have stagnated over the decades due to a floundering economy.

The LHC is the most complex machine ever built, but rockets are built en mass and have to do insane things to function. The Saturn 5 for instance was made up of over 3 million individual parts. All of which had to withstand the astronomical (literally) power produced by the machine upon launch and its ascent. <br><br>This has not changed, every rocket ever designed uses well over a million parts, each one is a bespoke device, and even the Shuttle program (after 25 years of use) was only able to get the potential failure odds down to 1 in 15. The Saturn 5 had a 1 in 4 chance to detonate every time it was used due to how insanely complex they were. <br><br>Rockets blow up now because we are applying new techniques to them, or because a single piece of equipment in those over a million separate pieces failed. Yes, a single point of failure on a rocket is enough to cause an RUD. This will always be the case due to the science behind them. <br><br>In the two SpaceX detonations, the first one was because of a fault in production by a 3rd party manufacturer, and the second was an unknown consequence of their new fueling procedure combined with the carbon fiber interior of the rocket. <br><br>You simply cannot know everything, and rockets will always blow up.

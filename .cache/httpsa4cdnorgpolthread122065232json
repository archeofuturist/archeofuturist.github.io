The richest and most secular from each country. Unlike europe, we can do that because we have an ocean between us and shitskinistan. It&#039;s called brain drain and it hurts all the countries we do it to to (India China etc) because they lose their most successful people. It might benefit us but even that is arguable. It certainly fucking hurts the milleneals because we can&#039;t afford to own property in our own fucking country we were born in. We will be paying rent our whole lives to Chinese landlords. It hurts so much I try not to think about it.","time":1492734516,"resto":122065232,"id":"+q721ij1","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]}

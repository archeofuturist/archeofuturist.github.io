It&#039;s generally not well understood, even among people who say they have it.<br><br>Broadly there&#039;s three types of depression:<br>1) fake depression. This is where your dog died and you&#039;re really sad. You say you&#039;re depressed because depression = muh sadness, but you don&#039;t &#039;have depression&#039;.<br><br>Real clinical depression is different to sadness, includes symptoms like insomnia, fatigue, thinking\/concentration problems, etc, for at least two weeks.<br><br>2) neurotic\/reactive depression. This is like having anger management issues except with sadness. Your dog died, you&#039;re so sad that you quit your job and stay home drinking, lose sleep. etc. You need to toughen up and get over it, you should go to a therapist to learn how. Medication is about as effective as placebo. About 90% of clinical depression is this type.<br><br>3) biological\/endogenous depression. This is more a biological problem like diabetes, but with cognitive symptoms. Nothing happened but you&#039;re sad, you quit your job and stay home drinking, losing sleep, etc. anyway. Medication is effective, therapy usually isn&#039;t. About 10% of clinical depression is this type.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;How do we find the right way to look and handle it?<\/span><br><br>Know there are different types that need different treatments.","time":1490939666,"resto":119021876,"id":"6VyH0Dvh","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"}]}

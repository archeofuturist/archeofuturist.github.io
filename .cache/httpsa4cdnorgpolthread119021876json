It&#039;s generally not well understood, even among people who say they have it.<br><br>Broadly there&#039;s three types of depression:<br>1) fake depression. This is where your dog died and you&#039;re really sad. You say you&#039;re depressed because depression = muh sadness, but you don&#039;t &#039;have depression&#039;.<br><br>Real clinical depression is different to sadness, includes symptoms like insomnia, fatigue, thinking\/concentration problems, etc, for at least two weeks.<br><br>2) neurotic\/reactive depression. This is like having anger management issues except with sadness. Your dog died, you&#039;re so sad that you quit your job and stay home drinking, lose sleep. etc. You need to toughen up and get over it, you should go to a therapist to learn how. Medication is about as effective as placebo. About 90% of clinical depression is this type.<br><br>3) biological\/endogenous depression. This is more a biological problem like diabetes, but with cognitive symptoms. Nothing happened but you&#039;re sad, you quit your job and stay home drinking, losing sleep, etc. anyway. Medication is effective, therapy usually isn&#039;t.

It&#039;s disgraceful and belittles people who have serious problems. People who are required to be removed from society and live alone on $800\/month. <br><br>Leftists are as of lately counterproductive to the very field of psychology they claim to support by belittling the plights of the mentally ill and marginalizing people with serious mental illness.","filename":"123123156666","ext":".png","w":600,"h":600,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490940756303,"time":1490940756,"md5":"OjJYODokDoy4+FGZWgrOnA==","fsize":451110,"resto":119021876,"id":"SjlrsUU3","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119028586,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)02:15:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119022474\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119022474<\/a><br><br>Little bitch","time":1490940948,"resto":119021876,"id":"Mzuorqt6","country":"HR","country_name":"Croatia"},{"no":119029329,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)02:26:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"I thought it was a meme until I couldn&#039;t even watch TV and slept 14h\/day.

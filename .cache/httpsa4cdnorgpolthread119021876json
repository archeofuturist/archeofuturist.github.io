It&#039;s generally not well understood, even among people who say they have it.<br><br>Broadly there&#039;s three types of depression:<br>1) fake depression. This is where your dog died and you&#039;re really sad. You say you&#039;re depressed because depression = muh sadness, but you don&#039;t &#039;have depression&#039;.<br><br>Real clinical depression is different to sadness, includes symptoms like insomnia, fatigue, thinking\/concentration problems, etc, for at least two weeks.<br><br>2) neurotic\/reactive depression. This is like having anger management issues except with sadness. Your dog died, you&#039;re so sad that you quit your job and stay home drinking, lose sleep. etc. You need to toughen up and get over it, you should go to a therapist to learn how. Medication is about as effective as placebo. About 90% of clinical depression is this type.<br><br>3) biological\/endogenous depression. This is more a biological problem like diabetes, but with cognitive symptoms. Nothing happened but you&#039;re sad, you quit your job and stay home drinking, losing sleep, etc. anyway. Medication is effective, therapy usually isn&#039;t. About 10% of clinical depression is this type.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;How do we find the right way to look and handle it?<\/span><br><br>Know there are different types that need different treatments.","time":1490939666,"resto":119021876,"id":"6VyH0Dvh","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":119027871,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)02:05:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119027040\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119027040<\/a><br>Type 2 here, been there for bout 10 years.

I&#039;m biased. It&#039;s a serious mental illness that requires time, therapy and sometimes psychotropics to overcome. <br><br>However in recent years it has become one of the most overblown mental illnesses ever. Every kid with a computer and some angst thinks they have depression. It&#039;s very annoying when they try to come into my office to tell me what they have when I know that they don&#039;t after the first hour.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;How do we find the right way to look and handle it?<\/span><br>If someone has a diagnosis and takes legitimate medication for their illness you should treat it like you would any other illness. Don&#039;t feel sorry for them but at least acknowledge it for what it is. Show them support in their endeavor they might be going through a lot. That&#039;s not to say you should patronize them and make it out to be a big deal. They&#039;ll get over it but being demonized for it isn&#039;t going to help. That&#039;s the exact reason they&#039;re depressed in the first place and you&#039;re only contributing to it.<br><br>People who aren&#039;t on medication and don&#039;t have a formal diagnosis should be slapped by every person they tell it to. It&#039;s disgraceful and belittles people who have serious problems. People who are required to be removed from society and live alone on $800\/month. <br><br>Leftists are as of lately counterproductive to the very field of psychology they claim to support by belittling the plights of the mentally ill and marginalizing people with serious mental illness.","filename":"123123156666","ext":".png","w":600,"h":600,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490940756303,"time":1490940756,"md5":"OjJYODokDoy4+FGZWgrOnA==","fsize":451110,"resto":119021876,"id":"SjlrsUU3","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119028586,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)02:15:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119022474\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119022474<\/a><br><br>Little bitch","time":1490940948,"resto":119021876,"id":"Mzuorqt6","country":"HR","country_name":"Croatia"},{"no":119029329,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)02:26:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"I thought it was a meme until I couldn&#039;t even watch TV and slept 14h\/day.

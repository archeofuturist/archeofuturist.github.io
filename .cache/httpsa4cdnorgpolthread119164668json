In late August 2014, the Grand Mufti of Saudi Arabia, Abdul-Aziz ibn Abdullah Al ash-Sheikh, condemned ISIL and al-Qaeda saying, &quot;Extremist and militant ideas and terrorism which spread decay on Earth, destroying human civilization, are not in any way part of Islam, but are enemy number one of Islam, and Muslims are their first victims&quot;.[372] In late September 2014, 126 Sunni imams and Islamic scholars\u2014primarily Sufi[373]\u2014from around the Muslim world signed an open letter to the Islamic State&#039;s leader al-Baghdadi, explicitly rejecting and refuting his group&#039;s interpretations of Islamic scriptures, the Quran and hadith, which it used in order to justify its actions.[374][375] &quot;[You] have misinterpreted Islam into a religion of harshness, brutality, torture and murder ... this is a great wrong and an offence to Islam, to Muslims and to the entire world&quot;, the letter states.[376] It rebukes the Islamic State for its killing of prisoners, describing the killings as &quot;heinous war crimes&quot; and its persecution of the Yazidis of Iraq as &quot;abominable&quot;. Referring to the &quot;self-described &#039;Islamic State&#039;&quot;, the letter censures the group for carrying out killings and acts of brutality under the guise of jihad\u2014holy struggle\u2014saying that its &quot;sacrifice&quot; without legitimate cause, goals and intention &quot;is not jihad at all, but rather, warmongering and criminality&quot;.[376][377] It also accuses the group of instigating fitna\u2014sedition\u2014by instituting slavery under its rule in contravention of the anti-slavery consensus of the Islamic scholarly community.","filename":"Wien_-_Kobane-Demo_2014-10-10_-_V","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":853,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1491039984581,"time":1491039984,"md5":"6sC2RkLkgN27ektekQduYA==","fsize":263841,"resto":0,"id":"KDW2mPsP","country":"CA","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"terrorists-represent-all-musli","country_name":"Canada","replies":1,"images":1,"unique_ips":1},{"no":119164820,"now":"04\/01\/17(Sat)05:48:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;when pol realizes all the most populous Muslim countries designate ISIS as a terrorist organization.<\/span>","filename":"terrorist organization","ext":".png","w":895,"h":648,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":90,"tim":1491040120433,"time":1491040120,"md5":"2X5nuHMMD4f5WOs9e2RGNA==","fsize":68645,"resto":119164668,"id":"KDW2mPsP","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]}

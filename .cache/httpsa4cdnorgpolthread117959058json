I don&#039;t care if it&#039;s a so-called &#039;forgery&#039;. The Protocols Of The Elders Of Zion are in agreement with direct observation of the world as it is today. Not only that, but Henry Ford said &quot;The only statement I care to make about the Protocols is that they fit in with what is going on. They are sixteen years old and they have fit the world situation up to this time. They fit it now.&quot;. That was almost a century ago now, yet the Protocols Of The Elders Of Zion is depressingly EVEN MORE TRUE NOW than it was back then.","filename":"148461319","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":500,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490291440317,"time":1490291440,"md5":"ujMGQvT0T2cSPERDsrNabQ==","fsize":286590,"resto":0,"id":"awPZkwPd","country":"AU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"if-the-protocols-of-the-elders-of-zion-is-a","country_name":"Australia","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

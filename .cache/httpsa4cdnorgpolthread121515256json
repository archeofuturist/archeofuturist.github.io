Western civilization stripped us of our spirituality and our connection to our land and now Europe is being flooded with shitskins to replace the Europeans themselves.","time":1492438879,"resto":121515256,"id":"ZRsIw0rr","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121530974,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)10:23:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121530736\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121530736<\/a><br>uhuh, nice story, Varg","filename":"1482796559372","ext":".jpg","w":350,"h":350,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492439031415,"time":1492439031,"md5":"7Iy09Cz537iL6L5YfNh\/bw==","fsize":104379,"resto":121515256,"id":"zDLs8x15","country":"GE","country_name":"Georgia"},{"no":121532579,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)10:38:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121518408\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121518408<\/a><br> REV. 2: 2-5 \u2018I know your deeds and your toil and perseverance, and that you cannot tolerate evil men, and you put to the test those who call themselves apostles, and they are not, and you found them to be false; 3and you have perseverance and have endured for My name\u2019s sake, and have not grown weary. 4\u2018But I have this against you, that you have left your first love. 5\u2018Therefore remember from where you have fallen, and repent and do the deeds you did at first; or else I am coming to you and will remove your lampstand out of its place\u2014unless you repent.","time":1492439933,"resto":121515256,"id":"uHkEOPux","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121533622,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)10:47:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121518408\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121518408<\/a><br> 38For I am convinced that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers, 39nor height, nor depth, nor any other created thing, will be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.

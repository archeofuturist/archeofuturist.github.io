It usually is related to it, so this scrying is more like a help to be one step ahead of future events.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;But what info do I need?<\/span><br>Your query, a number, a picture that reminds you to that query and your favourite quote. (Simple right?)<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What do I ask in exchange?<\/span><br>A reading based on this question, with your query (with the info needed - see above)<br>(I am a 23 years old Male Capricorn btw)<br><br><br>\u25cfWill I start a lovr relationship between what&#039;s left of April to the end of June?

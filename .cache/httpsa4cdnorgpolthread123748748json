I found out about 4chan after coming across some weird gif compilations on youtube. I thought it was made by a guy with the username &quot;4chan&quot;, but then found out it was a website. i was eventually let to the source of the memes: good old \/b\/. At first, I was shocked at all the porn, gore, excessive use of the word nigger, etc., so I would quickly get off and erase my history, but then in the middle of night, my curiosity would get the best of me and I would peek in it again. I came across a thread where someone released a bunch of passwords to a Christian dating site and everyone was fucking up everyone&#039;s profiles. Being the edgelord, I fucked up someone&#039;s profile and there was something really arousing about it, even though I was a Christfag. I soon became a fedorafag and participated in some raids like on Habbo Hotel, Tom Green, prank calls. I just thought it was fun spouting out these random words and phrases called &quot;memes&quot;.

I loved calling Pizza Hut and asking if they had grapes because it would get them really mad for some reason.<br>I think when I got exposed to atheism, it was like an entry level redpill, even though I&#039;m not an atheist anymore.

Also, even when shooting .22LR use some ear protection. I never did when I was a kid and I think I can hear OK now but it seems like a lot of people really take it seriously. Larger calibers will do more damage and sound scarier without earpro. Check out hickok45 on youtube and watch his videos too.

Fire shots in the general direction of the target without really aiming. Grip the gun really hard. Let your hand really absorb it. You&#039;ll see that it&#039;s not so bad. If it is, buy those grip trainer things. They go up to ridiculously high weights. Work your way up until recoil isn&#039;t uncontrollable for you.<br>Rifle is a similar thing, but you really are going to just have to nut up when it comes to recoil. Go to a gym also. It&#039;ll help. Eventually you&#039;ll relax at the thought of the coming recoil and noise.","time":1492407855,"resto":121486018,"id":"jxSg+QNY","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121486638,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)01:44:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121486018\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121486018<\/a><br>Suppressors","time":1492407891,"resto":121486018,"id":"v\/kBXLTf","country":"PH","country_name":"Philippines"},{"no":121486782,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)01:46:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121486018\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121486018<\/a><br>Go to the range with your own rifle until you realize the gunshots don&#039;t phase you anymore.","time":1492407969,"resto":121486018,"id":"7zZhwOMN","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121486850,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)01:46:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121486638\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121486638<\/a><br>Until based Trump helps the hearing protection act in the US get through suppressors require a tax stamp (fee), months to get, and you get put on a list.<br><br>Could roll your own out of an oil can or something though.","time":1492408010,"resto":121486018,"id":"7M2zoFll","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121486971,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)01:48:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121486338\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121486338<\/a><br>\/thread","time":1492408088,"resto":121486018,"id":"NjvqEHHV","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121487301,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)01:51:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121486018\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121486018<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I&#039;ve started to prep for the incoming race wars<\/span><br><br>Do you guys ever read what you write on here, this sounds retarded as fuck. <br><br>Muh race war lmao<br>Please step back into reality.","time":1492408302,"resto":121486018,"id":"S4zZAdkr","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121487630,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)01:55:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121487301\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121487301<\/a><br>What the fuck is wrong with the sentence?","time":1492408510,"resto":121486018,"id":"YVMPWizm","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121487905,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)01:58:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121486018\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121486018<\/a><br>Go to a gun range and rent an AR-15.

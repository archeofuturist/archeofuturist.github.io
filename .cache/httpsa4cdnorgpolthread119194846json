Rand Paul of Kentucky and Rep. Tim Walberg of Michigan have introduced legislation to reform civil asset forfeiture, a practice by which law enforcement agencies seize the property and assets of individuals with minimal due process.<br><br>The practice has encouraged \u201cpolicing for profit,\u201d distorting the mission of police agencies toward revenue generation to the detriment of the property rights of Americans. Paul\u2019s and Walberg\u2019s bill should unite those concerned with upholding constitutional rights and justice more broadly.<br><br>The FAIR (Fifth Amendment Integrity Restoration) Act, previously introduced by Paul in 2014, seeks to shore up the rights of Americans facing civil asset forfeiture proceedings and curb the perverse profit incentives which underline the practice.<br><br>\u201cThe federal government has made it far too easy for government agencies to take and profit from the property of those who have not been convicted of a crime,\u201d said Paul. \u201cThe FAIR Act will protect Americans\u2019 Fifth Amendment rights from being infringed upon by ensuring that government agencies no longer profit from taking the property of U.S. citizens without due process.\u201d<br><br>Under current practices, federal agencies, often in partnership with state and local police departments, may seize a person\u2019s cash, home or vehicle simply upon the suspicion that such assets were connected to criminal activity. One need not even be charged or convicted of a crime to have personal assets permanently seized.<br><br>Pic Unrelated","filename":"whitegirl","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":640,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491136403300,"time":1491136403,"md5":"va4ge7gmFkL+x5RzcyO+2A==","fsize":30761,"resto":0,"id":"fCTiM6TB","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"where-does-pol-stand-on-civil-forfeitures","country_name":"United States","replies":33,"images":8,"unique_ips":26},{"no":119194916,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)08:34:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"Spooky","time":1491136464,"resto":119194846,"id":"W0mtoH89","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":119194972,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)08:35:13","name":"[\u00df\u00df\u2b50redpilled\u00b0trap]","com":"<a href=\"#p119194846\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119194846<\/a><br>Government should keep their hands off others property","time":1491136513,"resto":119194846,"id":"+9MZwiRJ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119195092,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)08:36:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119194846\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119194846<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;That arche<\/span>","time":1491136615,"resto":119194846,"id":"\/q0YvHga","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119195103,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)08:37:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119194846\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119194846<\/a><br>taking from non whites is okay if they are really nasty and mean, taking from jews is double okay and should be encouraged.","filename":"1487277691523","ext":".jpg","w":430,"h":302,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":87,"tim":1491136624838,"time":1491136624,"md5":"CfKkWw3BGOXVva6FTwG29A==","fsize":45969,"resto":119194846,"id":"nuUsp\/2M","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":119195154,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)08:37:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"It&#039;s unAmerican.","time":1491136666,"resto":119194846,"id":"wGwliAwP","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119195400,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)08:41:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"Government theft.<br>Just like taxation ;D","time":1491136897,"resto":119194846,"id":"\/YGxDrBh","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":119195450,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)08:42:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119194846\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119194846<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;that pic<\/span>","filename":"image","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":480,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":100,"tim":1491136943245,"time":1491136943,"md5":"vTghk497jDHDmJcd4xl+aw==","fsize":59419,"resto":119194846,"id":"vyHc3eBO","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119195586,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)08:44:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119194846\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119194846<\/a><br>Is it wrong that I want to kiss that foot?","filename":"sweating","ext":".jpg","w":300,"h":300,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491137065559,"time":1491137065,"md5":"aNK6FwN8olOV8\/jSfC5ywA==","fsize":15013,"resto":119194846,"id":"OhUumwVO","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":119195655,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)08:45:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"&quot;You&#039;re not under arrest, buy your money is!&quot;<br><br>It&#039;s a complete scam and John Oliver of all people had a good bit about it before his show was sold to Hillarys Globalist Campaign","time":1491137125,"resto":119194846,"id":"KvoJCN3+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119195664,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)08:45:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119195450\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119195450<\/a><br><a href=\"#p119195586\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119195586<\/a><br>KIDS ARE NOT FOR LEWD <br><br>REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE","time":1491137136,"resto":119194846,"id":"\/+GixWOY","country":"NZ","country_name":"New Zealand"},{"no":119195801,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)08:47:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119194846\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119194846<\/a><br>why is she in a car seat she&#039;s like 8","filename":"1489702170311","ext":".gif","w":414,"h":382,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":115,"tim":1491137254178,"time":1491137254,"md5":"j8Gv77ysRNsEI1T1OUM2tQ==","fsize":2961925,"resto":119194846,"id":"k1IWXx8y","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119197938,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)09:16:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119194846\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119194846<\/a><br>I see this image and I&#039;m like &quot;I&#039;m not saving that image&quot;

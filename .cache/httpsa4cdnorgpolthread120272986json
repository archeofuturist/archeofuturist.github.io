Let me explain. Trump waited with the atttack until he was with chinese president at Mar-a-lago, Why? It&#039;s called force projection and was supposed to show chinese leader that Trump is not weak like Obama, and china needs to take America seriously (which btw they didn&#039;t during Obama presidency, because Obama kept backing off). So basically it was force projection diplomacy. Secondarily neither Russia or US is happy that Assad keeps using chemical weapons. So basically Russia partially greenlid operation punish Assad, for chem weapons. However it was done in such a way as not to offend Assad from Russian side directly. For cucks such as sweden this move showed that Trump is serious political leader, who will be more like any other previous US president and not mr.weirdo. Also since they are cucks, they actually really care about syrian suffering so it was good PR. Good Trump destroying evil Assad lair. I bet no one at white house shed a tear for syrians, it&#039;s all about realpolitik. What worries me thou is more shaky position of Bannon, but the whole thing might be smoke and mirrors, since he will still participate in those meetings, just not as council member (btw during previous presidents this was a case with political advisors).","time":1491738943,"resto":120272986,"id":"5xttCzDP","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":120274834,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)07:56:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120272986\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120272986<\/a><br>It&#039;s indefensible.","time":1491738998,"resto":120272986,"id":"38GlkDTy","country":"TH","country_name":"Thailand"},{"no":120275678,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)08:09:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"muh biblical truth <br>only democracy in the middle east","time":1491739760,"resto":120272986,"id":"1mqHoMZp","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":120275738,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)08:10:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120272986\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120272986<\/a><br>I didn&#039;t know leftism and sjwism is the new american policy","time":1491739816,"resto":120272986,"id":"7eguzBd5","country":"FR","country_name":"France"}]}

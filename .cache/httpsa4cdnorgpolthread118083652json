Six years ago, I would have called practically everyone here the enemy. The conditioning from years of public education and media indoctrination were strong. Oddly enough what broke it was the left&#039;s all out assault on firearms after Sandy Hook. The left had gone pretty much silent running on guns about the time the 1994 Federal Assault weapons Ban sunsetted in 2004. I got into competitive shooting about 2006. And being a nerd, I learned all I could about my new hobby. technical details of the firearms themselves, as well as all the laws surrounding guns, of which there are a lot. And aside from to occasional nutty outburst from the New York and California politicians, the left stayed quiet about guns. That all changed with Sandy Hook. I watched as people I believed lied their asses of about guns, gun laws and gun death statistics. And that made me wonder, &quot;If they&#039;re lying about this, what else are they lying about?&quot; See, I knew the Neocons and the Tea Partywere all lying sacks of shit, but somehow, I believed the Democrats were the good guys. Turns out, they just lie about different things. And once Obama got his second term and lost the Senate in 2014, he went full Social Justice retard, and that kicked it right over the edge. Cause when the party you thought had your interests in mind actually openly talks about your extinction being a good thing, well, time to get on the trump train, sister. Trump may be a lying sack of shit, but he&#039;s our lying sack of shit who plans to stick it to the flaming bag of dog shit that is the current Democratic Party. And that&#039;s good enough for me.

I think the mental mechanism is a profound sense of betrayal. Which, looking back, isn&#039;t entirely realistic. I mean, I didn&#039;t really care about or know about the whole firearms thing back in the 1990&#039;s. I mean, i owned a couple of guns, but what Southerner doesn&#039;t? From a political standpoint, the smarter people on the Left had realized gun control was a loosing issue and had shut the hell up about it by the time i got into the shooting sports in a serious way. So I was able to rationalize that the left had given up on gun control and the rest of their agenda (equality, multiculturalism, Yeah!) was a good thing. Then sandy Hook happened, and they thought they had their Dunblaine or Port Aurther. This ignored the fact that Americans had responded to the assault weapons and Brady Bill by going out and buying more guns, which caused an explosion in the shooting sports. And like I said, they lied their asses of about everything to do with firearms to try and get their way. Which left me feeling betrayed. I recognize this is not entirely rational. But it is what it is. The the Zimmerman shooting happened and in the interest of pushing their narrative, the media &quot;promoted&quot; George Zimmerman, a half Jewish one quarter Native Peruvian, one quarter Black man to &quot;white.&quot; And Obama, the president himself, stepped in to fan the flames of racial tension. And it just kept going. So here I am. In about six years I&#039;ve gone from being a &quot;moderate&quot; leftist to a member of the &quot;Alt Right,&quot; for whatever it&#039;s worth. To OP&#039;s baity point, maybe I&#039;m not a &quot;good guy,&quot; but I sure as hell ain&#039;t one of (((them))) or one of their minions. And neither is Trump.

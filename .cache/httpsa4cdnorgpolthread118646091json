In fact, most of our countries have Pan-Slavic colors on our flag in one way or another (White, Red and Blue), so check that box. <br><br>There are many things that all Slavs have in common: our languages are ridiculously similar (it might not seem that way but I know for a fact that about 6 months of intensive learning of another Slavic language can get you fluent if you are diligent enough), we&#039;re all Christians and yes, we do like to drink, as sad as it is. But more importantly we all value our cultures and get quite defensive about them. We don&#039;t like mass-immigration coming from culturally alien countries, we take pride in our history and don&#039;t try to edit it for the sake of political correctness, we do not forget our heroes of the past. <br><br>Imagine what we could accomplish if we worked together. We could have a European Union without its failures such as multiculturalism (because our cultures are similar and we do not accept immigration), promotion of useless rights (SJWs, homosexuals and so on) and so on. What does \/pol\/ think of it?<br><br>There have, of course, been many feuds between the Slavs: the Poles captured Moscow, the Russians divided Poland a few times and so on and so forth. But do we really need to go a few hundred years back to find some quarrel that has no effect on our lives today? The UK and the US work together, yet, may I remind you that they waged several wars against each other.<br><br>And, yeah, I&#039;d like to stress that a proposed Pan-Slavic Union should not be a unitary political entity: in other words larger countries such as Russia or Poland should not be able to infringe the interests of smaller nations such as Serbia or Belarus.","filename":"CyrilMethodius","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":960,"tn_w":156,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490706008368,"time":1490706008,"md5":"lO8QD553c2fs9gb0Ko4jsw==","fsize":143528,"resto":0,"id":"CWlo24QL","country":"AU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"panslavism-thread","country_name":"Australia","replies":2,"images":1,"unique_ips":1},{"no":118646351,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)09:03:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"inb4:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;%countryname%<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;slav<\/span>","time":1490706212,"resto":118646091,"id":"CWlo24QL","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":118647115,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)09:12:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"By the way, artificial Slavic languages like Slovio are fairly understandable to any Slav.

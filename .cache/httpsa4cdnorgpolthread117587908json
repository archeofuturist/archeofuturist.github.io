If the countries in Europe haven&#039;t woken up by this point, I don&#039;t think they ever will. It&#039;s clear that no matter how many terrorist attacks happen, or how many migrants come in, it will just keep happening in the West. Even closing the borders now would just buy time; a lot of the problem is INSIDE the Western nations and growing. Not to mention, millions of citizens, if not the majority, are utterly brainwashed into globalist dogma. It&#039;s going to be bad when millenials get control of government, as these liberal freaks will do everything they can to destroy the nations. Sometimes it feels hopeless.","filename":"3b11bdd4645cb956c62d0561386ebba8","ext":".jpg","w":564,"h":423,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":187,"tim":1490071254584,"time":1490071254,"md5":"CSJaylMmQ5gCUDw67rOVZg==","fsize":50784,"resto":0,"id":"6mulxMHX","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-blackpill","country_name":"United States","replies":6,"images":0,"unique_ips":5},{"no":117588066,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)00:42:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117587908\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117587908<\/a><br>I feel exactly the same, anon.

Surely people would vote to save their countries?

Meanwhile in Europe their white majority countries seem to keep wanting more pain. And that fact that Trump\/Brexit voters tend to skew older is another thing that makes me really pessimistic about the future. I think future governments are determined so that Trump\/Brexit could never happen again.","time":1490071846,"resto":117587908,"id":"6mulxMHX","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117589092,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)00:52:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"I think people are waking up, albeit slowly.

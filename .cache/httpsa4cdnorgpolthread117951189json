Already more than 22 conservative and moderate republicans said they would not vote for the bill, so I dont think it will pass unless there are some serious last min negotiations. As far as if I like it, im mixed. The massive tax cuts for the wealthy are pointless. Block granting medicaid to the states will help lower the deficit but millions of lower income people will loose healthcare. AND Medicaid wont cover drug rehab anymore so thats aids.

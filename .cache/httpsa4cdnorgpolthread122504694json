You can thank us later for solving another one of humanity&#039;s longstanding existential issues.<br><br>And like the more cerebral burger said, there is easily a confusion of terms between free will and absolute freedom. It is specifically the &quot;will&quot; that is denoted as being free, and even then it is a very technical definition. No, we are not born into this world with an existential game shark at our disposal, although I suspect in the next decades that will constitute our greatest temptation as a human race. And so we do not have freedom to make every choice that can possibly be imagined. But if we are defining freedom as the minimum prerequisite to give us the status of responsible--rather than fully innocent, like animals--beings, then yes, our will, though seriously compromised, has just enough requisite agency to makes us beings who bear responsibility. <br><br>The picture also changes if we stop analyzing the level of freedom in our willing function as if we were just looking at a single moment frozen in time where a person chooses between two things. In reality our lives are substantially, though not fully, the sum of our admittedly weak wills making incremental progress toward an imagined end by choices which at the moment seem inconsequential. It seems a mystery to us because we can&#039;t analyze that lifelong series of incremental influences on reality on a spreadsheet, but if you could, you&#039;d see huge disparities between how people have used the opportunity of being a willing creature.<br><br>Faith comes into play too, because it is God who ratifies and empowers the will when it reaches out in its weakness.

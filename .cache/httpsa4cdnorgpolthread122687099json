If men refuse, they&#039;re evil sexists and misogynists. But once women are in it, they don&#039;t join in the camaraderie, which like here involves a lot of bantz and insults, which is how people develop thicker skin and gain some humility. But women take it seriously, get offended, then everyone needs to learn sensitivity, and the next thing we know soldiers and marines are forced to march in high heels and understand transgenderism, etc. They never get that the reason we want exclusively male scenes is because women don&#039;t understand and constantly try to spoil the social dynamics that makes it possible for boys to learn how to be men.<br>As a kid, I got bullied a lot, but I never really get that bothered by bullying from boys. I&#039;d just insult them back, get in fights sometimes, and sometimes that worked and improved my status in the group. I hated social environments with girls, because there everyone has to be sensitive, and pretend everyone is equal. But they really aren&#039;t, and there&#039;s always little cliques and status hierarchies based on who the girls like the most. Even if you&#039;re the omega-male, in a male environment you can still earn respect and improve your place, and there a many times as a kid where I was able to do that.<br>But in these censored sensitivity-policed environments, if you&#039;re the loner or pariah then you&#039;re hopeless, there&#039;s practically nothing you can do to change it. You&#039;re just shunned as the weirdo loner, while you have to listen to everyone pat themselves on the back about how egalitarian and sensitive they are. I think that&#039;s what really makes a lot of men, especially the kinds of guys who come here, so angry and disgusted. We know these feminized liberal types are total hypocrites, that if anything they have they have the most rigid and oppressive social hierarchies, where once assigned a place you can&#039;t really do anything to change it. And yet we&#039;re the bad guys.","time":1493096648,"resto":122687099,"id":"B3Gie8a\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122695497,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)01:04:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122695429\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122695429<\/a><br>You lucky bastard","time":1493096670,"resto":122687099,"id":"oDRRoObs","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122695528,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)01:04:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122695445\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122695445<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;They never get that the reason we want exclusively male scenes is because women don&#039;t understand and constantly try to spoil the social dynamics that makes it possible for boys to learn how to be men.<\/span><br>(((They))) understand.

And part of why I snapped out of it was I could see this.<br>Anything you suggest in leftist circles that might improve things for real people here and now, is always rejected. It&#039;s like how Marx called religion the &quot;opium of the masses.&quot; Anything that makes people happy, gives them fulfillment, is just lulling them into sleep and accepting &quot;exploitation.&quot; We need more alienation, more unhappiness, because supposedly that will lead to some glorious revolution and create utopia. Marxism itself, especially the Leninist revolutionary form, advocates this in economics too - the goal of reforms within capitalist society isn&#039;t to help the working class, it&#039;s to &quot;intensify the contradictions&quot; until the system breaks. That&#039;s how leftists justify their alliance with the globalists, who in turn give lip service to socialist\/progressive rhetoric - because leftists (correctly) know globalism will fail, will just lead to even greater inequality and oppression, but leftists think that will in turn lead to global revolution. I had even heard of some Marxist academics supporting mass immigration for that reason - the white working class is too content, to accepting of capitalism, so they have to be replaced with poor, miserable, angry people who can supposedly be won over to communism.<br>I got in some very heated arguments with people when I was involved in this, because I couldn&#039;t accept that kind of logic. And ultimately I had to accept that that&#039;s just how leftists are. They don&#039;t really know how to create anything positive, so this myth of some ultimate revolution is an excuse for what&#039;s really just negative, destructive behavior now. Leftists get under your skin enough from the outside, but from the inside, if you are a decent person at heart, they really really get under your skin. It&#039;s hard not to just hate and write people off, but then I have to remember that there are a lot of leftists who were like me, who are just misguided.","time":1493097222,"resto":122687099,"id":"B3Gie8a\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122696391,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)01:14:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122696121\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122696121<\/a><br>Thats because we dont bag it","time":1493097241,"resto":122687099,"id":"jXJJnzTy","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122696394,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)01:14:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"Let Canada burn","time":1493097243,"resto":122687099,"id":"VeQhgpez","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122696452,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)01:14:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122696225\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122696225<\/a><br>The Leafs chose to be cucks might as well get a piece of the action","time":1493097288,"resto":122687099,"id":"ZH8Rozl3","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122696540,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)01:15:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122695979\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122695979<\/a><br>tribute now","time":1493097346,"resto":122687099,"id":"cSTZYjB8","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122696546,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)01:15:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122696209\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122696209<\/a><br>Valley of the Fallen in Spain.<br><br>Monument to those who died fighting commies in the Spanish civil war","time":1493097350,"resto":122687099,"id":"Q3C0qQ3b","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122696588,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)01:16:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122696209\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122696209<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Nice pics.

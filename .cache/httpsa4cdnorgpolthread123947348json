It&#039;s those, sometimes annoying, rules that keep the game coherent and recognisable as Monopoly. The instant someone cheats, the instant they step outside the rules of the game in an effort to establish individualistic rule, they ruin the game for everyone and nothing is fair anymore.<br><br>Society is just a game and in order to maintain the society, to stop it crumbling in to an unrecognisable mess, we must enforce the original rules of the game to the letter. The people we allow in, the concepts we allow to flourish, they are intent on changing the rules of the game, on changing how Monopoly is played. And if we allow them to do it they will craft rules in their benefit while telling every other player it&#039;s for their benefit too, but truth is they have their hand in the bank while you&#039;re looking the other way. So of course they win, you let them win because you thought individualistic rule was better as it didn&#039;t make them upset. You wanted to make that player feel free and by doing so you transformed the game in to anything goes.<br><br>Now each new player learns these new &quot;rules&quot; and plays by them. Before you know it you&#039;re the only one left actualy sticking to the real rules of the game, but you keep losing unfairly. So you bring it up, you ask them to go back to the original rules but they shout you down by saying you&#039;re just jealous that you never win, you&#039;re just trying to ruin the game. They laugh at you and mock you, they tell all their friends about how much of a sore loser you are. Then when you get angry, when you can longer take the self-righteous actions of the the other players and you lash out, they call the police on you and have you taken away.","filename":"1489335133461","ext":".jpg","w":1336,"h":744,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":69,"tim":1493842102677,"time":1493842102,"md5":"qnNNUtxSlJtvnviWICFpAQ==","fsize":364162,"resto":123947348,"id":"pTGWjMHd","country":"GB","m_img":1,"country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123956395,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)16:13:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123954956\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123954956<\/a><br>Additionally...","filename":"1493350675552","ext":".png","w":952,"h":1103,"tn_w":107,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493842438747,"time":1493842438,"md5":"+YJzEx1RVbcAwuoD\/xPRJA==","fsize":832147,"resto":123947348,"id":"6kko3JCL","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":123956698,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)16:15:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123947348\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123947348<\/a><br>You have the wrong, individualistic mindset. Individualism ignores people&#039;s actions as part of a group, though you might think you only interact with people as individuals, their actions as groups do affect you. If you chose to ignore that entire sphere, you as part of your group will be vulnerable due to inaction.<br><br>When groups interact, there&#039;s no moral of virtue guidelines, there are the group interests. &quot;Alright people&quot; do look after the people they care about, that makes them good people too. But it&#039;s at the detriment of outgroups, the world is a competition.<br><br>The preface of the book Culture of Critique goes in depth about individualistic and collectivistic cultures. The conclusion is that, much more important than &quot;not all Xs are Ys!&quot; or &quot;There are many good Xs too!&quot;, is considering their community affiliations, their identity, and their consideration of group interests when acting.<br><br>The rest of the book analyzes Jews, their primary identification as Jews, and their if they have Jewish interests in mind when acting.<br><br>No matter if they were businessmen, artists or communists, Jewish identity is very strong and primary. They also very commonly prioritize Jewish interests, whether Jews as a whole would benefit has always been a central point to their interests and actions.<br><br>So your latino friend who is very helpful, loyal and friendly might legitly be a good person, but if there&#039;s a conflict of interest, say electing a pro or anti immigration politician, don&#039;t expect him to take an action that would benefit you to his detriment. Why would he, and would it even be virtuous? Which of these positions are the most moral? It&#039;s all group interests.","time":1493842559,"resto":123947348,"id":"A\/jcohnm","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":123956983,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)16:17:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123954713\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123954713<\/a><br>When the rest of the country isn&#039;t white it doesn&#039;t matter how white your place is, Federal law will be dictated by non-whites in their favour and you&#039;ll suffer.

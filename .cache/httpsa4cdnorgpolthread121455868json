Now I feel like I can&#039;t trust any major news outlet and whenever my friends talk about politics I get very aggressive and annoyed (most of them being liberal). I don&#039;t like this change and I want to fix it how should I do it? Stop going on pol? I feel like it&#039;s to late to turn back and I&#039;m already corrupted.

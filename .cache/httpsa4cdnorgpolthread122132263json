I would be happy if she won, to see EU cucks and the rest of the rampant faggots buttmad, Merkel, Schulz, Junkier pissing themselves with angst, but we have to accept the fact it&#039;s impossible. EU is beyond saving. Don&#039;t try to meme shit out the day before the election, it&#039;s futile. Trump&#039;s campaign was all memes all day for two years, that&#039;s why he won. Le Pen is not the same, nobody here even understands what she&#039;s talking about and every single European is too afraid of being called a Nazi, so he&#039;ll vote for amorphous bureaucratic status quo politician in a grey suit with a grey face saying grey expressions, even if that means he&#039;ll get his head cut off and his 4-year old daughter raped to death and cannibalized by a feral pack of Somalian niggers that politician helped import.<br><br>This is grim truth, but fear of being called a Nazi is too strong here, up to the point aforementioned. <br><br>It&#039;s game over, man. Trump and Putin must nuke us to liberate us.","filename":"16003293_1139902886128578_5807381293044567114_n","ext":".jpg","w":550,"h":442,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":200,"tim":1492779168068,"time":1492779168,"md5":"6LHj4xaHPbmzoQKRK+nnnw==","fsize":70313,"resto":0,"id":"5T4RAdrD","country":"HR","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"le-pen-will-unfortunately-lose","country_name":"Croatia","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

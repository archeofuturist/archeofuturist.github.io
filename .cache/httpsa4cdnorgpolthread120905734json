I believe it would give a good background to criticism of social sciences. <br><br>I&#039;d say there are two main issues:<br><br>1) Social scientists weave narratives. This is a problem because they are ideologically extreme, and dishonest in how they do it.<br><br>One is absurd overstretching: &quot;We see that people in a controlled setting when told by an authority to administer electric shocks do so. This could shed some light on how Hitler rose to power and that the mechanisms behind it are not gone. <br><br>Another is narrative-crafting using possibility-words - could-should-might. Social sciences maintain a false label of scientific inquiry by avoiding strong conclusions - but instead, narratives are crafted using the most vague and double-sided words like &quot;could&quot;, &quot;may&quot;, that create impressions and feelings with no cost or justification. If X &quot;could&quot; be the case, then the opposite of X &quot;could&quot; also be the case.<br><br>Another way is by selecting who they quote. &quot;Science&quot; is supposed to be crafted on a &quot;brick by brick&quot; model, which is supposed to include quoting a number of authors. But in reality there are so many authors with so many perspectives, that they have free choice to &quot;quote&quot; whatever view they want to promote.<br><br>Another is the ideological extremism of people in the field, as regularly witnessed.<br><br>These factors add together. A rabid feminist author will make some statements that men are inherently misogynist. Then she writes a &quot;paper&quot; where she quotes only rabid feminists, and concludes that &quot;the results of this experiment could illuminate Trump&#039;s rise to power&quot;.<br><br>Fun story: I went to a top university and wrote a very long essay. After writing it, I searched in journals to find random people who had said things to support my narrative, and inserted them as sources, adding them on with (Bobson, 1957) at the end of my sentences. I got a very good grade on it.","time":1492091742,"resto":120905734,"id":"El4Stv4S","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":120914534,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)10:21:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120911987\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120911987<\/a><br>Oh, the second problem:<br><br>- What they find appears so often to be common sense, that &quot;everyone could have told you&quot;.

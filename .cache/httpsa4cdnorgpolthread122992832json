We&#039;ve already won. Your further crying is just the cherry on top. Look at the polls, 96% of people who voted for him don&#039;t regret it.

God I hated Hillary, but didn&#039;t trust Trump.<br><br>Then I saw a video of a bunch of tolerant liberals kicking some homeless black woman for trying to stop them from decimating Trump&#039;s star in Los Angeles. At this point I just thought these people can&#039;t be allowed to get power, they don&#039;t really care about what they say they do. They&#039;re just a cult. <br><br>I hate a lot of the positions republicans have on scientific research and policy, but the left is far worse. They turn it into a religion. They try to make all the social justice bullshit a science, like trans people and gender fluidity. That&#039;s pseudoscience just like they bitch at the republicans about. Everything with their ideology is a dogma, and its worse than mixing true religions and state because there&#039;s nothing blocking that dogma since it wouldn&#039;t be recognized as a religion. <br><br>This shit needed to stop, and yes I did base half my vote on it?<br><br><a href=\"#p122992988\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122992988<\/a><br>So yes, call me a cancer, I don&#039;t give a fuck.

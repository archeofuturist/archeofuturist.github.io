These are isotopes which have short half lives and so do not occur naturally in measurably significant abundance. They also have unique decay profiles which means that a single atom&#039;s decay can be detected and identified.<br><br>We detect this uptick in these &quot;artificial&quot; isotopes almost worldwide. It won&#039;t be statistically significant in the southern hemisphere because the Coriolis effect means wind and water patterns tend not to transport material between hemispheres but pretty much anywhere in the northern hemisphere you could detect above-background Cs-137, for example. Finding just two or three atoms of it would be above background.<br><br>As far as the important thing, &quot;how dangerous is it&quot;, the answer is if you&#039;re living in Fukushima right now, &quot;basically not at all&quot;. Assuming linear no-threshold is appropriate (an assumption the WHO does not currently back) the worst case scenario would be that a statistically significant uptick in a couple cancers i.e. leukemia could be detectable in the local population. Over a very extended period of time living there and drinking the water and eating the crops grown there it may be enough to cause a couple dozen cancers and kill a couple people out of the hundreds of thousands in the area. If some non-linear model of risk is appropriate, as is likely, it is much less dangerous even than this.<br><br>If you do not live in the immediate area, the risk is waaaaaaaaay below noise. *technically* you could get ONE atom of Sr-90 in your body, which COULD decay and COULD cause a mutation that COULD cause cancer that COULD kill you... But if you spread this amount of radioactive material around the world you&#039;re not even at a billionth of the background which we are exposed to every day. For example, the pacific ocean contains 2.8 x 10^13kg of K-40, a natural beta-emitter.

What was never clear to me was when this began or whether it affects all apple products or only specifically targeted ones.<br>-Amazon has a deal with the CIA to enable them to access hardware, but also backdoors to their web and server services. Again i know there&#039;s details I&#039;m missing here. <br>-Backdoors to almost every single OS, including Linux and Tails, and every single version of windows since ME at least.<br>-Ability to turn any smart device, including Samsung TVs into listening devices (i don&#039;t know why anyone is surprised, Samsung already admitted that their TVs are always &#039;listening&#039;). This is exactly why people were suspicious of the &#039;always on, phoning home&#039;s feature on XBones.<br>- Talk of XBones and PS4s\/PS3s also being used like this, at least ones with microphone\/cam attachments<br>-Android hacking tools.<br>- NSA and CIA had separate sigint data collection programmes developed in competition and have almost been at war behind the scenes over this for years.<br>- finally, all of the above backdoors\/exploits\/jailbreaks were lost to unknown actors. Even after discovering the security breaches neither agency sought to inform any of the companies that a) there were vulnerabilities and b) knowledge of those vulnerabilities and how to exploit them was compromised and now &#039;in the wild&#039; for anyone to use.<br><br>What else?

What is daily life like there? Are your people happy?<\/span><br>You need to understand that Russia is a study in contradictions. Grozny (Capital of Chechnya), St-Pb(Northern capital) and Vladivostok(Literally: Ruler of The east) have very little in common with each other as far as daily life goes. And that&#039;s before you start looking outside major cities.<br>Overall It&#039;s fine. Happier in Cities, much the same as everywhere in Europe.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;2. Is it a good place to visit? I&#039;d like to go to Russia but it looks extremely depressing, cold and outright shitty. There has to be some good nightlife somewhere or some beautiful scenery.<\/span><br>Beautiful scenery is pretty much all over, it&#039;s just that not everyone find same things beautiful, thankfully russia spans all climate zones sans desert. As to good tourism places with night life, I&#039;d recommend SPb, it would be least culturally shocking for a foreigner and has plenty night life. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;3.

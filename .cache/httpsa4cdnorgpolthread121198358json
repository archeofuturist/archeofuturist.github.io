What is daily life like there? Are your people happy?<\/span><br>You need to understand that Russia is a study in contradictions. Grozny (Capital of Chechnya), St-Pb(Northern capital) and Vladivostok(Literally: Ruler of The east) have very little in common with each other as far as daily life goes. And that&#039;s before you start looking outside major cities.<br>Overall It&#039;s fine. Happier in Cities, much the same as everywhere in Europe.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;2. Is it a good place to visit? I&#039;d like to go to Russia but it looks extremely depressing, cold and outright shitty. There has to be some good nightlife somewhere or some beautiful scenery.<\/span><br>Beautiful scenery is pretty much all over, it&#039;s just that not everyone find same things beautiful, thankfully russia spans all climate zones sans desert. As to good tourism places with night life, I&#039;d recommend SPb, it would be least culturally shocking for a foreigner and has plenty night life. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;3. What are your women like? Are they leftist cunts like in America and Australia, are they redpilled or just normal?<\/span><br>It, much like everything else, depends on what part of russia you are in. Young ones tend more towards golddiging and manipulation than most others, but not by much.","time":1492254439,"resto":121198358,"id":"zb\/qTNKA","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":121199339,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)07:07:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121198358\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121198358<\/a><br>Daily life is ok, it is really different from your country I guess<br><br>Yes, Russia is a great place, full of beautifull places, if I were you I would not even visit the capital cities, but go to smaller old towns to feel the soul of this country<br><br>Women are the same as everywhere I guess, maybe the difference is that our do see their eventual goal in life as becoming wives and mothers","time":1492254439,"resto":121198358,"id":"dbF91ULF","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":121199590,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)07:10:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121199337\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121199337<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121199339\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121199339<\/a><br><br>So is it similar to Australia in that there is a fuck load of uninhabited land?","time":1492254647,"resto":121198358,"id":"ZUUVfj6A","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":121199774,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)07:13:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121199590\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121199590<\/a><br>Our population density is about twice that of yours, but overall - yes, most of russia is uninhabited.","time":1492254817,"resto":121198358,"id":"zb\/qTNKA","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":121199973,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)07:16:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121198358\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121198358<\/a><br>Stay away from here, you aussie cunt.","time":1492254973,"resto":121198358,"id":"fwY4k0Un","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":121200175,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)07:19:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121199590\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121199590<\/a><br>yes, just change the temperature from + to -","time":1492255154,"resto":121198358,"id":"dbF91ULF","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":121200339,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)07:21:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121198358\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121198358<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What is daily life like there?<\/span><br>Depends on the place.

Some of it involving hate speech and other just non family friend content. Because of this it was widely reported that big advertisers were pulling out due to the current climate of that social justice movements for decades have been strengthening. While Google may be claiming that these problems are \u201cvery very very small\u201d and that the ad controversies will be rectified. They have slowly been rolling out changes, such as channels not being able to monetize unless they hit a certain threshold for views.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; how Google is apparently handling it:<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; \u201cWe\u2019re also raising the bar for our ads policies to further safeguard our advertisers\u2019 brands.\u201d\u2026That statement followed a more direct plea to advertisers earlier this week in which Google promised it would be giving brands more direct control over and insight into where ads were placed on YouTube and Google-partnered third-party sites. The company also promised new tools like artificial intelligence-powered filtering that would detect offensive language and other contents within a video and flag it. Bloomberg reports that Google plans on implementing these new tools and changes as soon as this Sunday, according to an internal company memo. Yet it\u2019s unclear just how effective Google\u2019s new tools will be, and what it might take to bring advertisers back.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; According to newer guidelines, YouTube won\u2019t monetize the following types of videos:<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Sexually Suggestive Content , Including Partial Nudity and Sexual Humour<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Violence , Including Display of serious Injury and Events Related to Violent Extremism<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Inappropriate Language , Including Harassment , Profanity and Vulgar Language<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Promotion of Drugs and Regulated substances , Including selling , Use and abuse of such Items<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Controversial Related to WAR , POLITICAL CONFLICTS , natural disasters and Tragedies , Even If Graphic Imagery Is not Shown<\/span>","filename":"1492126366032","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":720,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1492134551059,"time":1492134551,"md5":"MMC7mVekL3ILBld+dwd3+Q==","fsize":35013,"resto":0,"id":"P7xlZoU4","country":"IN","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"youtube-is-kill-sjws-beat-youtube-into-submission","country_name":"India","replies":2,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":121000526,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)21:52:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"This is the reality \/pol\/ accept it. <br><br>Its youtube today, tomorrow your nation.

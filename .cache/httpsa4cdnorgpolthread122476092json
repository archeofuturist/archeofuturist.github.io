Le Pen is hated and despised. Called a racist. A traitor. Most people are rational and goodhearted, and they know a woman like that has no business in the highest office. To say nothing of the marginalized and persecuted minorities who will flock to support Macron, who promises them a brighter future. Go to your neighbor and tell them you support Le Pen. Then watch as they slam the door in your face.<br><br>I&#039;m serious. Go out in public and see what happens when you make your political views public to your social circles. Your family, your friends and your co-workers.<br><br>You will be an outcast in days while progressice views are accepted as the norm.","filename":"Marine Le Pen elei\u00e7\u00f5es 2013","ext":".jpg","w":518,"h":744,"tn_w":174,"tn_h":249,"tim":1492977329040,"time":1492977329,"md5":"ch5Y6LossXlC9sHSI6H4pA==","fsize":71337,"resto":0,"id":"DvdWLpe0","country":"BR","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"why-le-pen-will-lose","country_name":"Brazil","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":122478105,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)16:07:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"Shill<br>Side<br>Shill<br>Side<br>You know both words seem to fit in this box<br><br><br>Sage","time":1492978036,"resto":122476092,"id":"\/bid0fyH","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

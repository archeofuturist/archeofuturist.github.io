But, that was the hand Trump was dealt from Obama, weather you or I like it or not. He needs to take advantage of the hand he&#039;s been given, and removing Russian sactions is his ultimate Trump card (no pun intended) in Russia\/USA relations. Getting them removed is obv somthing Russia really wants, so we should only remove them when Russia is prepared to give us something we really want in exchange. <br>The current chilly Russia\/USA relations can only go up from here. And when they start thawing, we hold the Trump card of removing sanctions, not them.","time":1492870091,"resto":122278344,"id":"eJ6bxfwZ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122280290,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)10:10:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"I&#039;d be trying to distance myself from Russia too.

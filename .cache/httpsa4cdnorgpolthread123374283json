Thus the only way leftwing thought can exist as a prevailing ideology is for a society to enforce rules that treat feelings as if they somehow magically change reality: AKA limit free speech.<br><br>Pic related is a perfect example of this truth in action. The leftist mindset of placing the importance of &quot;muh fweelingz&quot; takes precedent over the obvious medical fact that being a hamplanet is extremely unhealthy. The leftist thus gravitates toward the social bubble that is willing to ignore the facts and just tell them things that will make them feel better. The sad part is, this comic isn&#039;t satire. It is actually written by a real leftist who is entirely serious in their belief that feels are reals. <br><br>This is how leftists actually think. This can be applied to almost all leftist theory. For example, socialism is based entirely on leftist &quot;feelings&quot; that capitalism breeds inequality and that&#039;s &quot;not fair&quot;, but they ignore the fact that in practice socialism does not work and instead tell themselves the lie that it wasn&#039;t &quot;real socialism&quot;. They are able to tell themselves this lie because they still &quot;feel&quot; like socialism should work, so any time it doesn&#039;t work there must be something wrong.

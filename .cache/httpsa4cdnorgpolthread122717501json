Another tried to get my boss to do all her work. She was a wierd looking woman, over 6 foot tall, we called her lurch.

They started monitoring her computer - she spent all day on dating sites flirting with black dudes. They found a box of her g-strings under the desk. (my boss said &quot;Thank god I didn&#039;t have to talk to her about having to wear underwear in the office!&quot; They fired her, and found out that she&#039;s been stuffing things into filing cabinets randomly.

The VP was a Asian woman who was married to another VP. This was a medium sized company, too. She was never in the office. She was constantly traveling to hr &quot;seminars&quot;. She was in the office MAYBE 5 days a month. Her department did nothing, because there was no manager below her. I had the misfortune of doing a project that involved them - they&#039;d set a deadline that wasn&#039;t enough time, sweat us to get it to them, and then they&#039;d sit on it for months. This was stuff that had to be done, by law. Our project, that we worked on a year, was scrapped because nobody would sign off on it, and they literally physically cut and pasted stuff together to have something to file - and then blamed it on us when it was rejected. We learned quickly, if you complained to HR, they would help the person you were complaining about get you fired. If you complained, they would sit you down and haul in that person, or get them on the phone, and expect YOU to work it out, while they sat there getting fatter. Luckily I never tangled with them. There was one decent woman in there, but she left quickly. <br><br>The only conflict I ever had, was at a video store. I worked there in college - we all got along, great crew, cool boss. Then the owner hired this fat fucking CUNT of a woman, in her late 40&#039;s, husband threw her out, and she was living in a van. Day one, our toilet\/sink bathroom became HER bathroom. She washed in the sink. She stank. We all hated her - and for no reason, she decided she hated me. She&#039;d try to get me fired almost every day. It got to the point where my boss (a killer chick) would sneak me into the office, and we&#039;d listen to the latest cunty voicemail about me. My boss would laugh, say &quot;don&#039;t worry, we checked the video, you&#039;re safe.&quot; She quit in a cunty huff because they wouldn&#039;t give her more than part time hours - none of us did.

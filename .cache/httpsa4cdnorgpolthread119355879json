Then, after the election, did they self reflect and change? No, instead they used control of MSM to keep pushing their narrative. As if anyone fucking listens to this shit anymore. People only voted Hillary because they hated Trump more.They seem to think that due to the fact their views are on TV and Trump lost the popular vote, that they still represent any kind of majority. Nobody gives a fuck anymore, they are so out of touch. They lose more and more of the peoples faith every day, even by just refusing to move on. You lost the election okay? Holy fuck, get over it and start looking at went wrong. They are completely out of touch, they&#039;re sitting with their own personal circles, connected to MSM Jews and sponsors, still pushing the same garbage.

I just read all the relevant news articles, and I have a profile for you.<br><br>The killer is a white male, aged 40-55, medium build, between 5&#039;8 and 6&#039;3. He has short hair. He is physically strong, but does not use force as the primary means to overpower the victims.<br><br>He operates a taxi or owns a nice 4-door vehicle. He may have a history of misdemeanor offenses, probably dating back to over a decade ago. I would start with a list of men arrested for solicitation of prostitution between 2005-2010. I would cross reference this with arrests for simple battery.<br><br>The victim profile is white men in their early twenties, slim build or effeminate features, usually intoxicated. Often they have been stuck outside in cold weather without a jacket. He initiates the encounter by offering them a lift, or a chance to warm up in his vehicle.<br><br>I do not have access to any autopsy findings, but I suspect a careful autopsy would discover burn marks on the left side of the victims&#039; torsos. Perhaps the decay after being dumped in the water makes this impossible to detect.<br><br>He uses a stun gun or a hand-held taser to subdue his victims, probably after driving away from the scene where they were picked up.<br><br>He has a location (not a house, but possibly a property or a storage unit) in the north or west end where he kills the victims. Cause of death is probably suffocation (not strangulation) and there may or may not be some kind of sexual or physical abuse.<br><br>TLDR;<br><br>You are looking for a white male, 40-55, medium build, 5&#039;8-6&#039;3, who owns a nice 4-door vehicle, owns property or rents a storage locker in the north or west end, has a history of solicitation and\/or battery charges from 2005-2010.

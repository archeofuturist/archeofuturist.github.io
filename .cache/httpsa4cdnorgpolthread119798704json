You know what a barrel bomb is right? This is no normal run of the mil bomb son, its made from a fucking BARREL. Let that sink in for a minute, A BARREL. Chemical weapons are a downgrade to that kind of destruction in my opinion.","time":1491515889,"resto":119798704,"id":"CNznWeGm","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119801924,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)17:58:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119801541\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119801541<\/a><br>You&#039;re literally do what everybody else gets annoyed with on a daily basis. <br><br><a href=\"#p119801675\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119801675<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;awoo = awoobaker<\/span>","time":1491515907,"resto":119798704,"id":"HSfCN4YQ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119801925,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)17:58:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119801541\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119801541<\/a><br>bullshit <br><br>anything can be explained on 4chan in under 30 seconds and under 100 characters <br><br>wikipedia- (50 pages)<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Caus<wbr>es_of_World_War_II<\/span><br><br>4chan- (two words)<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;the jews<\/span>","time":1491515909,"resto":119798704,"id":"rvYrrr7U","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119801955,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)17:58:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119800608\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119800608<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;they kept Islamists in check<\/span><br>Yea so much so that those Islamists are running around creating false flag chemical attacks. 7 years of civil war and multiple world-wide terrorist attacks = Assad keeping islamists in check","time":1491515919,"resto":119798704,"id":"hhIVcfpq","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119801961,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)17:58:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"is it just me or is https:\/\/futurism.com\/ blatant leftist muh science.

The syrian government and the russians never denied that they bombed the area to shit since the rebels started a big offensive there two weeks ago.

It&#039;s also possible that the airstrike just happend to hit a stockpile of shit they intended to use. Or that it really was a falseflag by whoever. Well, or that the government really dropped CWs there, but they&#039;d have absolutely no reason to do so. If they wanted to kill a few civvies they could&#039;ve done so with conventional weapons. Using gas on a small scale makes no sense.<br><br><br>From what tillerson said earlier (ISIS still main target in syria, assad has to go, political transition after country is stable, negotiating with international partners) i&#039;d just assume that trump and his administration are going with the current MSM shitstorm without planning military action. Just like back in 2013 or during the reconquest of aleppo with that boy in the orange seat the MSM has found sad pictures of dead children and are shilling a narrative hard. Going with it for now allows trump and his administration to please his critics on all sides without making any concessions.","time":1491515978,"resto":119798704,"id":"vq4XhL6q","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"}]}

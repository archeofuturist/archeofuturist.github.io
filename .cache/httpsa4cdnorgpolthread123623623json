Precisely because your system isn&#039;t set up to handle that. Republicans and Democrats keep making up rules for how elections should happen, how districts should look, who is allowed to join, when, how, where, with what questions, what media companies.. how much you need to poll to enter a debate keeps changing because those pesky third party people rise in the polls.<br><br>It&#039;s gatekeeping of the worst kind and it&#039;s not a right they have, just a right they&#039;ve assumed.

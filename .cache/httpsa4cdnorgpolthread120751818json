I&#039;m not saying that all great art is born and instantly appreciated as great art. That&#039;s silly. Sometimes, great art takes time to be appreciated and accepted by the larger collective.

He was writing dick jokes, fart jokes, sex jokes, and wanted and expected his work to be played for the masses.

Was it even a house?<br><br>That being said, when something does become a pop phenomenon, there&#039;s often a reason.

Maybe it&#039;s best for you to shelve it and come back to it later in your life? It&#039;s the same as how the collective things become popular, go away for a while, and then experience a resurgence.

And again I would say that now more than ever, there are people with the technical skill, education, and resources to produce art in vast quantities. I really think the failure of art runs deeper than &#039;inadequate artists&#039;. Its something like, the language of art itself has run out of possibilities (or is running out). The way art speaks to us has exhausted its possible configurations. And I reiterate that there is nothing more to talk about. Art functions as a repository of common cultural understanding, the fact that the topics art confronts have become more and more contrived and irrelevant is an embodiment of this fact. In their desperate search for something worth saying, artists mostly just talk about art itself now.","time":1492009663,"resto":120751818,"id":"7nfajLZ3","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120766943,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)11:22:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120763843\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120763843<\/a><br>Youre asking me what makes a house a house... that pretty tough.<br><br>What is a house&#039;s essence.

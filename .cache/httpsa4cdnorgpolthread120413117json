Back in the days, you used to browse this board for 2 years before posting anything - and that was the quality control \/pol\/ so badly needed. <br><br>As much as I supported Trum,p in the election, I can&#039;t say that I&#039;m glad to be on a board with some of his brainwashed supporters. T_d is the prime example of that - protecting their &quot;daddy&quot; to the last straw, even thought he might be wrong. That&#039;s the same delusion Hillary supporters had, with them not believing anything bad that revolved around their empress. <br><br>It&#039;s one thing to support a cause, it&#039;s another thing to die for that cause even if you know you&#039;re jack shit wrong. And that&#039;s the main difference between actual \/pol\/acks and newfags - the later are completely unable to admit a mistake, when necessary.","filename":"1479476164393","ext":".jpg","w":1020,"h":512,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":62,"tim":1491820697353,"time":1491820697,"md5":"yWvxfq9wDbbghjVfQO7big==","fsize":132918,"resto":120413117,"id":"w8c9MY57","country":"RO","country_name":"Romania"},{"no":120423408,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)06:39:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120413523\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120413523<\/a><br>This, don&#039;t fall to a russian officials speeches\/posts\/etc, historically when they design some serious plans they are silent as fuck.","time":1491820743,"resto":120413117,"id":"6ti9+42s","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":120423575,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)06:41:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120421945\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120421945<\/a><br>You yanks have absolutely no idea how much we mock you behind your backs.<br><br>General consensus is you guys could not navigate your arses around a truck without a computer telling you how.<br><br>After I left the service my mates told me nothings changed, they hate being put with Yanks, they would rather patrol with professionals.

The Turks of Asia Minor had since 1263 been raiding and expanding into Byzantine territory in Asia Minor. Anatolia, which had formed the very heart of the shrinking empire, was systematically lost to numerous Turkic ghazis, whose raids evolved into conquering expeditions inspired by Islamic zeal. With a decreasing source of food and manpower, the Palaiologoi were forced to fight on several fronts, most of them being Christian states: the Second Bulgarian Empire, the Serbian Empire, the remnants of the Latin Empire and even the Knights Hospitaller.<br><br>The loss of land in the east to the Turks and in the west to the Bulgarians was complemented by two disastrous civil wars, the Black Death and the 1354 earthquake at Gallipoli, whose destruction and evacuation allowed the Turks to occupy it. By 1380, the Byzantine Empire consisted of the capital Constantinople and a few other isolated exclaves, which only nominally recognized the Emperor as their lord. Nonetheless, Byzantine diplomacy coupled with the adroit exploitation of internal divisions and external threats among their enemies, and above all the invasion of Anatolia by Timur, allowed Byzantium to survive until 1453. The last remnants of the Byzantine Empire, the Despotate of the Morea and the Empire of Trebizond, fell shortly afterwards.&quot;<br><br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Byzan<wbr>tine_Empire_under_the_Palaiologos_d<wbr>ynasty","time":1492692215,"resto":121985964,"id":"GjHRSwn6","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121990914,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)08:43:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121989046\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121989046<\/a><br>forgetting about the massacre of the latins I see","time":1492692217,"resto":121985964,"id":"eqCS+gW3","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121990960,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)08:44:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121986775\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121986775<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;not turning it into the Roman Empire and reclaiming lost land<\/span><br>Why","time":1492692267,"resto":121985964,"id":"NgSLh6rW","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121991393,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)08:50:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121990859\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121990859<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Shitty position<\/span><br>You mean geographically?

The Serbs were gallavanting around after their brief stint as top dog; the Bulgarians were dumb and split their diminishing kingdom into 3 smaller ones (plus local feudal lords), so like...who was there even left to unite?

Can you imagine what kind of dirt they&#039;d get on Trump if they had access to all his dealings? And what about the majority of the Republican congress for that matter? They&#039;re probably fucking little boys on Sundays and their male personal assistants in the bathroom between sessions then voting on gay marriage bans when back at work.<br><br>Trump is a manchild with no understanding of the adult world. His world existed of people flirting with him to get his money. He was something people wanted so they had to be nice to him. Now peoples&#039; lives are in his hands. Now peoples&#039; livelihoods are in his hands. That means he&#039;s going to get yelled at. That means he&#039;s going to get challenged. <br><br>And that means he&#039;s going to fail, because ultimately, he&#039;s a failure as a person and as a businessman. A man who comes from a silver spoon upbringing and tens of millions of dollars of loans, and after a lifetime of business, he can&#039;t even crack double digit billions. He can&#039;t even crack 5 billion. There&#039;s almost two hundred other people in America alone with way more money than him, and most of them started from nothing.<br><br>So just remember. When you get drafted and carted off to Korea, don&#039;t expect parades and welcomes when you get home. Don&#039;t expect the GOP to survive when mothers and wives are burying their kids and husbands by the hundreds if not thousands.<br><br>There&#039;s no scenario where Trump is the winner, and that comes back on you.","filename":"60df520c08affc88e740a304bd88e2bb","ext":".jpg","w":564,"h":396,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":175,"tim":1491720469979,"time":1491720469,"md5":"A\/\/Ov5vYstpcd+QQ8wdl\/w==","fsize":71375,"resto":0,"id":"Du72\/XnZ","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"unfriendly-reminder-that-ifwhen-trump-plunges-us","country_name":"United States","replies":59,"images":17,"unique_ips":41},{"no":120253784,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)03:12:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Hillary was probably the most legit politician there is<\/span><br><br>argument ends there.","time":1491721953,"resto":120251648,"id":"QnYBbxuX","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120253883,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)03:13:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120251648\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120251648<\/a><br>SUBTLE","filename":"Know How To Beat Em!","ext":".png","w":1156,"h":2031,"tn_w":71,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491722015999,"time":1491722015,"md5":"MQYcjjFVppI3Vdhe7m4ajw==","fsize":296781,"resto":120251648,"id":"iaT3ZsgI","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120254050,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)03:15:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"Anybody who thinks War with Norks is even remotely likely is a low information retard.<br><br>China put Kim on notice two years ago.

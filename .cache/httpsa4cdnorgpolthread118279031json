When the Mexicans saw that Cortes had passed the fatal opening without filling it up, their object was gained. An immense body of troops, with numbers of canoes, which lay concealed for this purpose in places where the brigantines could not get at them, now suddenly rushed forth from their hiding places, and fell upon this ill-fated division with incredible fierceness, accompanied by the most fearful yells. It was impossible for the men to make any stand against this overwhelming power, and nothing now remained for our men but to close their ranks firmly, and commence a retreat. But the enemy kept rushing on in such crowds, that our men, just as they had retreated as far back as the dangerous opening, gave up all further resistance, and fled precipitately.

Around it, the Aztecs created a large artificial island using a system similar to the creation of chinampas. To overcome the problems of drinking water, the Aztecs built a system of dams to separate the salty waters of the lake from the rain water of the effluents. It also permitted them to control the level of the lake. The city also had an inner system of channels that helped to control the water.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;During Cort\u00e9s&#039; siege of Tenochtitlan in 1521, the dams were destroyed, and never rebuilt, so flooding became a big problem for the new Mexico City built over Tenochtitlan.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mexico City suffered from periodic floods; in 1604 the lake flooded the city, with an even more severe flood following in 1607. Under the direction of Enrico Mart\u00ednez, a drain was built to control the level of the lake, but in 1629 another flood kept most of the city covered for five years. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Eventually the lake was drained by the channels and a tunnel to the P\u00e1nuco River, but even that could not stop floods, since by then most of the city was under the water table. The flooding could not be completely controlled until 1967, with the construction of a Deep Drainage System.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The ecological consequences of the draining were enormous. Parts of the valleys were turned semi-arid, and even today Mexico City suffers for lack of water. Due to overdrafting that is depleting the aquifer beneath the city, Mexico City is estimated to have dropped 10 meters in the last century. Furthermore, because soft lake sediments underlie most of Mexico City, the city has proven vulnerable to soil liquefaction during earthquakes, most notably in the 1985 earthquake when hundreds of buildings collapsed and thousands of lives were lost.<\/span>","filename":"Tenochtitlan-Mexico City","ext":".jpg","w":687,"h":715,"tn_w":120,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490486343930,"time":1490486343,"md5":"epk3ZaKxt0oYwr0nM\/0dpw==","fsize":247678,"resto":118279031,"id":"NQWUDSB7","country":"MX","country_name":"Mexico"},{"no":118292218,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)19:59:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118290917\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118290917<\/a><br><br> Los \u00edberos son un pueblo guerrero.

Many Aztecs kept resisting, which is why in the central Mexico country side, there is like 2 million Nahuas (Aztecs) and that is not counting children and those who cant speak Nahuatl. The city folk of the Aztec empire were assimilated and mixed with the Spanish but the country side till this day resists. The Spaniards got their asses kicked all through Mexico, yeah they won a lot of battles and wars, but they lost a lot as well which is why Mexico has 30 million full blooded Natives. There is tribes like the Yaqui, Huichol, Tarahumara and Maya who were never conquered or defeated. And some of those tribes were armed with nothing more than wooden weapons. You got to give them props for that. My grandpa&#039;s tribe is Tarahumara he is descendant of a band of Tarahumaras who fought with a Tarahumara warrior called Teporaca.

Let me give an example: <br>Gen 1: find orphaned horse foal, tame them by feeding them and getting them used to your presence. <br>Gen 2: breed your tamed horses, out of the next generation select the most easily tamed specimens and only breed them. <br>Gen 50: Your horses have become progressively more and more domesticated (domestication is a spectrum, not a binary is\/isn&#039;t) until finally almost anyone can ride them without befriending them. <br><br>This is honestly the same argument I get from creationists who go &#039;well maybe you&#039;ve demonstrated micro evolution in the lab, but no one has any proof of macro evolution&#039;.

You cannot domesticate without taming, and you will eventually domesticate if you keep on taming. <br><br>t, evolutionary historian<br><br>Once, horses were no different from gazelles and zebra.

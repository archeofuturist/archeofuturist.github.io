The UK has been the biggest advocate of neoliberalism\/globalism out of any member state. For example the UK was the driving force in pushing for TTIP, it was Germany and France who were skeptical. Our government liked TTIP primarily because it would have committed the UK to back door deregulation and privitisation on a grand scale in a way that future governments could not easily change. <br><br>We&#039;re likely going to get TTIP on steroids just without the public service protections and EU consumer standards that were at least protected by the EU in negotiations. TTIP had provisions to protect things like the NHS, countries could opt into them as they individual situations warranted. The UK government chose not to protect the NHS within TTIP. The threat of TTIP to the NHS only ever came from our government, not the EU.<br><br>The EU is pushing towards reform of taxation to reduce corporate avoidance and evasion. The only party in the EU pushing for more unmitigated globalisation was the UK. You seem to think that the UK has voted against globalisation whereas it&#039;s likely that the government will cosy up to global corporations with tax breaks as a way to attempt to weather the Brexit storm.","filename":"U1ytuZS","ext":".png","w":700,"h":1500,"tn_w":58,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493204030518,"time":1493204030,"md5":"neOME0KDUmnMFmReJEk6FQ==","fsize":56057,"resto":122869629,"id":"8rGMVul5","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122871215,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)06:54:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122870946\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122870946<\/a><br>Your country was literally a part of Turkey lmao","time":1493204069,"resto":122869629,"id":"qyNG5Iuc","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122871245,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)06:54:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;White<\/span>","filename":"1492808509520","ext":".jpg","w":199,"h":253,"tn_w":98,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493204099504,"time":1493204099,"md5":"hIVRxKrPa7D7AprqBpJ6Eg==","fsize":12886,"resto":122869629,"id":"1d4+YtPX","country":"AT","country_name":"Austria"},{"no":122871313,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)06:55:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122869629\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122869629<\/a><br><br>Yes the conservatives are well known for there anti-globalism.

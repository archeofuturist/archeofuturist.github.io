Not just his presidency, but the person. They are completely obsessed with every fine detail of him. They&#039;ll criticize how he walks, talks, breathes, smiles, and even discuss the fact he doesn&#039;t have a dog in the White House. <br><br>Why is this? Is it because they feel personally bullied by him, like he destroyed their ideology? It&#039;s the kind of obsession I see between an ex-girlfriend who feels rejected, so they completely obsess over their ex and find imperfections. <br><br>Since June 2015, leftists have been obsessing over Trump. I know people who post about him nearly every day. I barely thought about Obama twice, but the average leftist I know cannot stop thinking and talking about Donald Trump.","filename":"IMG_7920","ext":".jpg","w":720,"h":714,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":247,"tim":1491026576923,"time":1491026576,"md5":"IXUKiIXL0w8SAb+8wKH+pQ==","fsize":63210,"resto":0,"id":"3ZIUbhqX","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"leftists-obsessed-with-trump","country_name":"United States","replies":4,"images":3,"unique_ips":2},{"no":119152255,"now":"04\/01\/17(Sat)02:04:59","name":"Anonymous","filename":"IMG_7914","ext":".jpg","w":1242,"h":768,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":77,"tim":1491026699298,"time":1491026699,"md5":"T6lrNXF8FuKE3L+\/y7nVsA==","fsize":85571,"resto":119152096,"id":"3ZIUbhqX","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":119152467,"now":"04\/01\/17(Sat)02:07:56","name":"Anonymous","filename":"IMG_7909","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":808,"tn_w":99,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491026876947,"time":1491026876,"md5":"8Jm+WDJAFxTixDiSOePGSg==","fsize":78786,"resto":119152096,"id":"3ZIUbhqX","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119152655,"now":"04\/01\/17(Sat)02:10:12","name":"Anonymous","filename":"IMG_7915","ext":".jpg","w":794,"h":796,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491027012614,"time":1491027012,"md5":"rZFNUwCdaCfbGZyIQOPeGw==","fsize":74369,"resto":119152096,"id":"3ZIUbhqX","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119153472,"now":"04\/01\/17(Sat)02:20:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119152096\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119152096<\/a><br>tbf, right wing shills were obsessed with shit like birth certificates, lattes, and tan suits.

The entire debate is pointless as there will never be an answer that ends it.<br>Instead, ask yourself whether you want God to exist or not. People who are religious want God to exist for various reasons- usually it&#039;s because they want to be rewarded in the afterlife. On the other side of the spectrum you have Atheists who deny Gods existence. They believe that God does not exist because of their belief in science. They believe that when you die you die and nothing else happens. Because they believe it, they also want it to be true- which means that they do not want God to exist. They would rather die and nothing happen than be sent to heaven to see their loved ones, be reincarnated into something new or even be gifted with 72 virgins.<br>Which would you prefer:<br>An afterlife or nothingness?","filename":"1465603304805","ext":".jpg","w":575,"h":960,"tn_w":74,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493766445733,"time":1493766445,"md5":"8jQpJk5Ndz6Tn5Q4Qzf5Tg==","fsize":41051,"resto":123833731,"id":"r4jG9aZu","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123834786,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)19:07:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123834312\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123834312<\/a><br>wtf I love the EU now.","time":1493766448,"resto":123833731,"id":"TwadsnY5","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123834859,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)19:08:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123834258\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123834258<\/a><br>Plz respond","time":1493766481,"resto":123833731,"id":"+tDm11qn","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123834875,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)19:08:10","name":"Anonymous","filename":"based macmillan","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":355,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":43,"tim":1493766490259,"time":1493766490,"md5":"iTpAPYD3DbuzFWu2+j0aSQ==","fsize":83586,"resto":123833731,"id":"mCKdwEDk","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123834896,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)19:08:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123834859\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123834859<\/a><br>No.","time":1493766498,"resto":123833731,"id":"eeM8i6tJ","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123834926,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)19:08:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123834589\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123834589<\/a><br>The White Walkers were a bigger bastard than the English ever where.<br>Nightking &gt; Thatcher","time":1493766513,"resto":123833731,"id":"DJs3L\/19","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"},{"no":123834979,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)19:08:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123834503\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123834503<\/a><br>He&#039;s already been on enough horses in his time by the sounds of things.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The Mail on Sunday claimed yesterday that Cox, who left in September, had behaved inappropriately towards women at the charity - he denies the allegations<\/span><br><br>http:\/\/www.thirdsector.co.uk\/save-c<wbr>hildren-refuses-comment-allegations<wbr>-against-former-director-policy-bre<wbr>ndan-cox\/management\/article\/1370951<wbr>","filename":"1470707328221","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":770,"tn_w":97,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493766536493,"time":1493766536,"md5":"cp3bqeTLsXuIZNiWDtFmOg==","fsize":130441,"resto":123833731,"id":"YLouEG0x","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123835197,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)19:10:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123834258\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123834258<\/a><br>Check out Pete North&#039;s Politics blog.","filename":"1477506232870","ext":".jpg","w":512,"h":512,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493766642123,"time":1493766642,"md5":"QNSg1sE0dd49YMpaCkJsWw==","fsize":37114,"resto":123833731,"id":"TwadsnY5","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123835227,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)19:10:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123834775\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123834775<\/a><br>L I T E R A L L Y <br><br>M A D","filename":"ire-sep09-fig1","ext":".gif","w":575,"h":384,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1493766658659,"time":1493766658,"md5":"crpcMoc44F57diLSZtBB7Q==","fsize":14231,"resto":123833731,"id":"2Sc\/z+qa","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123835285,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)19:11:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/123825717#p123828385\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123828385<\/a><br>Read Nietzsche and Heidegger <br><br><a href=\"#p123834875\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123834875<\/a><br>indeed, and Wilson kept us out of Vietnam.","time":1493766689,"resto":123833731,"id":"ePQeueHB","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123835377,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)19:12:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123833820\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123833820<\/a><br><a href=\"#p123833895\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123833895<\/a><br>Nice genetics. <br><a href=\"#p123834025\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123834025<\/a><br>It&#039;s a good idea.

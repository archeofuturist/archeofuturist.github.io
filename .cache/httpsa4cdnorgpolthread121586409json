She tried to incorporate elements of Bernie&#039;s campaign into hers and failed spectacularly. She ran against a right-wing populist and ignored the working class. Her organization sent around a 37 page manual on how to get the most out of their polling and actively meddled in the polling numbers. 96% of people in the media who donated to campaigns donated to hers, and pushed the narrative (sometimes at her campaigns direction) that it was her turn and that she could not possibly lose to Donald Trump. She aimed way too high on maslows pyramids of needs, and went after City people who have not been ruined by globalization, immigration, and free trade. If you didn&#039;t live within 30 miles of a city, she didn&#039;t care about you. She routinely held rallies of 50 to 100 people, while Trump held rallies in the tens of thousands. The media, of course, told us this was all irrelevant. They even had to hold concerts just to get people to listen to her talk. Even that, the media ignored. I almost forgot, her and her party actively kneecaped the Bernie Sanders campaign as it was gaining momentum between the first and second Super Tuesdays. Reducing the number of polling stations in Arizona down to about 20% of what they were before, and calling her the victory based on the results of early voting. They did the same thing in Missouri. There was even a bureau of New York City, or some 10,000 people voted, and not one of them voted for Bernie &quot;free shit&quot; Sanders.<br><br>She was a horrible candidate. You can even go back and watch videos of Democrats in 2008 talking about how bad of a candidate she would be because Republicans are salivating to run against her. Why do you think there were 17 Republicans in the beginning of the campaign? Because they were unorganized? No. Because Hillary Clinton is that bad.","filename":"1478955330950","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":731,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":89,"tim":1492471530897,"time":1492471530,"md5":"xVuEV1g6SpUMaOUCVXalzQ==","fsize":152071,"resto":121586409,"id":"YhJuZayB","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121600890,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)19:25:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"How do you go from this...","filename":"1481172794328","ext":".jpg","w":811,"h":1024,"tn_w":98,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492471542669,"time":1492471542,"md5":"a0aopxcK4uU\/XNS\/Q3L47g==","fsize":93108,"resto":121586409,"id":"3hzDPDBB","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121600895,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)19:25:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121586409\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121586409<\/a><br>Xcom baby","filename":"Xcombaby","ext":".png","w":791,"h":750,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":118,"tim":1492471544600,"time":1492471544,"md5":"3nfFYMVmqbTXrMTkMvjJgw==","fsize":979861,"resto":121586409,"id":"fXMlDwuE","country":"IT","country_name":"Italy"},{"no":121600952,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)19:26:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121586409\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121586409<\/a><br>In the shortest sense: Hillary pandered to SJW crap, Trump pandered to jobs.

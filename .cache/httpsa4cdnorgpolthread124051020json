Hence John Locke&#039;s proviso that one has &quot;property&quot; in land only to the extent that there is &quot;enough, and as good left in common for others.&quot; When there is not, land begins to have rental value. Thus, the rental value of land reflects the extent to which Locke&#039;s proviso has been violated, thereby making community-collection of rent (CCR) a just and necessary means of upholding the Lockean principle of private property. In the late 19th century, CCR became known as the &quot;Single Tax&quot; -- a term often used to denote Henry George&#039;s proposal to abolish all taxation save for a single tax on the value of land (irrespective of the value of improvements in or on it). Throughout the rest of this FAQ I will often refer to the Single Tax as the LVT (land value tax).","filename":"landright","ext":".jpg","w":327,"h":154,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":58,"tim":1493907781061,"time":1493907781,"md5":"P3JWnRXzb8WQ+N\/Nqfa0sg==","fsize":12543,"resto":124051020,"id":"5utW0pPH","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124064994,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)10:30:31","name":"Anonymous","filename":"8709ab5987febdc2d8c7c9142332fa16f7f3c3d0f333dfffdb263c61a83a41f4_1","ext":".jpg","w":800,"h":681,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":106,"tim":1493908231208,"time":1493908231,"md5":"pEj1OO4IhI87NvFji0lH1g==","fsize":99107,"resto":124051020,"id":"URWAuzVT","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":124065529,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)10:36:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124064290\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124064290<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Left-Libertarians, and other Shit-Libs need to fuck off.<\/span>","time":1493908570,"resto":124051020,"id":"J0Lh5xFw","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124065737,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)10:38:24","name":"What is Geolibertarianism?","com":"<a href=\"#p124065529\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124065529<\/a><br>Royal libertarians are ideologically inconsistent","filename":"rigtwinglpidiots","ext":".jpg","w":754,"h":382,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":63,"tim":1493908704178,"time":1493908704,"md5":"epAmD8wdd5Cn+GGrYMX9Hg==","fsize":42369,"resto":124051020,"id":"5utW0pPH","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124066317,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)10:44:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"Yes goys open the borders for the free market","time":1493909064,"resto":124051020,"id":"Y3HGTs7p","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124066500,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)10:46:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124066317\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124066317<\/a><br>No, fuck open borders fag.","filename":"merchant_piano","ext":".jpg","w":700,"h":525,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1493909178692,"time":1493909178,"md5":"RSo5Qyg4KIMnYDVLC9IubA==","fsize":75989,"resto":124051020,"id":"J0Lh5xFw","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124066555,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)10:46:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124053142\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124053142<\/a><br>The problem of open-borders is complicated. There could be no immigration restriction in Ancapistan that would violate the right of freedom of travel. The libertarian stance on open-borders should be therefore exactly that and like for any other government program that extends government power it should be opposed. However, the immigration of further nonintegrable &quot;citizens&quot; threatens to bloat the welfare state and extend government power anyway so in the long run it&#039;s a non-issue. A re-arrengement of priorities needs to happen, otherwise the state makes it impossible for you to consistently stick by your ideals. The reason why those people are flocking to the West is benefits in the first place so the welfare state needs go to first. Being anti or for immigration doesn&#039;t matter after that. Either way, one thing you can be sure is that no ancap would hold the liberal position of accepting even more refugees.

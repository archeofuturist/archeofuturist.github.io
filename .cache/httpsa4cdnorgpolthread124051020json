Hence John Locke&#039;s proviso that one has &quot;property&quot; in land only to the extent that there is &quot;enough, and as good left in common for others.&quot; When there is not, land begins to have rental value. Thus, the rental value of land reflects the extent to which Locke&#039;s proviso has been violated, thereby making community-collection of rent (CCR) a just and necessary means of upholding the Lockean principle of private property. In the late 19th century, CCR became known as the &quot;Single Tax&quot; -- a term often used to denote Henry George&#039;s proposal to abolish all taxation save for a single tax on the value of land (irrespective of the value of improvements in or on it).

The right to the use of land belongs at birth to each individual. So while the consent of others is not needed, it is, nevertheless, necessary that in the exercise of that right, one does not infringe upon the equal right of others -- i.e., violate Locke&#039;s proviso that there be &quot;enough, and as good left in common for others.&quot; And since the rental value of land provides an accurate measure of the extent to which said proviso has been violated, &quot;others&quot; should be compensated in accordance with that value. At the same time, of course, all taxes on labor and capital should be abolished, since they violate the exclusive right that each individual has to the fruits of his own labor.","filename":"capita","ext":".jpg","w":571,"h":290,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":63,"tim":1493913650868,"time":1493913650,"md5":"W72SLUCJ6GP4ILTMYuThWw==","fsize":68580,"resto":124051020,"id":"5utW0pPH","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124074342,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)12:04:22","name":"What is Geolibertarianism?","com":"<a href=\"#p124073979\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124073979<\/a><br>Sick memes bro<br><br>The classical liberal distinctions between land, labor and capital were greatly confused by socialists, and particularly Marxists, who substituted the fuzzy abstract term, &quot;means of production,&quot; for all three factors.

Economic life is not meant solely to multiply goods produced and increase profit or power; it is ordered first of all to the service of persons, of the whole man, and of the entire human community. Economic activity, conducted according to its own proper methods, is to be exercised within the limits of the moral order, in keeping with social justice so as to correspond to God&#039;s plan for man.<\/span><br>Any alternative to capitalism will lead to starvation and tyranny.

For a criminal would only lose his right to life if he had first deprived some victim of that same right. It would not be permissible, then, for a merchant whose bubble gum had been stolen, to execute the convicted bubble gum thief. If he did so, then he, the merchant, would be an unjustifiable murderer, who could be brought to the bar of justice by the heirs or assigns of the bubble gum thief.<br><br>But, in libertarian law, there would be no compulsion on the plaintiff, or his heirs, to exact this maximum penalty. If the plaintiff or his heir, for example, did not believe in capital punishment, for whatever reason, he could voluntarily forgive the victim of part or all of his penalty. If he were a Tolstoyan, and was opposed to punishment altogether, he could simply forgive the criminal, and that would be that.<br><br>Or \u2014 and this has a long and honorable tradition in older Western law \u2014 the victim or his heir could allow the criminal to buy his way out of part or all of his punishment. Thus, if proportionality allowed the victim to send the criminal to jail for ten years, the criminal could, if the victim wished, pay the victim to reduce or eliminate this sentence.

This problem could be taken care of simply by people stating in their wills what punishment they should like to inflict on their possible murderers. The believer in strict retribution, as well as the Tolstoyan opponent of all punishment, could then have their wishes precisely carried out. The deceased, indeed, could provide in his will for, say, a crime insurance company to which he subscribes to be the prosecutor of his possible murderer.<br><br>If, then, proportionality sets the upper bound to punishment, how may we establish proportionality itself? The first point is that the emphasis in punishment must be not on paying one&#039;s debt to &quot;society,&quot; whatever that may mean, but in paying one&#039;s &quot;debt&quot; to the victim. Certainly, the initial part of that debt is restitution. This works clearly in cases of theft. If A has stolen $15,000 from B, then the first, or initial, part of A&#039;s punishment must be to restore that $15,000 to the hands of B (plus damages, judicial and police costs, and interest foregone).<br><br>Suppose that, as in most cases, the thief has already spent the money. In that case, the first step of proper libertarian punishment is to force the thief to work, and to allocate the ensuing income to the victim until the victim has been repaid.

Then, the government, instead of forcing A to repay B or to work at forced labor until that debt is paid, forces B, the victim, to pay taxes to support the criminal in prison for ten or twenty years&#039; time. Where in the world is the justice here? The victim not only loses his money, but pays more money besides for the dubious thrill of catching, convicting, and then supporting the criminal; and the criminal is still enslaved, but not to the good purpose of recompensing his victim.<br><br>The idea of primacy for restitution to the victim has great precedent in law; indeed, it is an ancient principle of law which has been allowed to wither away as the State has aggrandized and monopolized the institutions of justice. In medieval Ireland, for example, a king was not the head of State but rather a crime-insurer; if someone committed a crime, the first thing that happened was that the king paid the &quot;insurance&quot; benefit to the victim, and then proceeded to force the criminal to pay the king in turn (restitution to the victim&#039;s insurance company being completely derived from the idea of restitution to the victim).<br><br>In many parts of colonial America, which were too poor to afford the dubious luxury of prisons, the thief was indentured out by the courts to his victim, there to be forced to work for his victim until his &quot;debt&quot; was paid. This does not necessarily mean that prisons would disappear in the libertarian society, but they would undoubtedly change drastically, since their major goal would be to force the criminals to provide restitution to their victims.4","time":1493919509,"resto":124051020,"id":"+PnQNlaa","country":"PT","country_name":"Portugal"}]}

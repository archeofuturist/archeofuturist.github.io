Hence John Locke&#039;s proviso that one has &quot;property&quot; in land only to the extent that there is &quot;enough, and as good left in common for others.&quot; When there is not, land begins to have rental value. Thus, the rental value of land reflects the extent to which Locke&#039;s proviso has been violated, thereby making community-collection of rent (CCR) a just and necessary means of upholding the Lockean principle of private property. In the late 19th century, CCR became known as the &quot;Single Tax&quot; -- a term often used to denote Henry George&#039;s proposal to abolish all taxation save for a single tax on the value of land (irrespective of the value of improvements in or on it).

The right to the use of land belongs at birth to each individual. So while the consent of others is not needed, it is, nevertheless, necessary that in the exercise of that right, one does not infringe upon the equal right of others -- i.e., violate Locke&#039;s proviso that there be &quot;enough, and as good left in common for others.&quot; And since the rental value of land provides an accurate measure of the extent to which said proviso has been violated, &quot;others&quot; should be compensated in accordance with that value. At the same time, of course, all taxes on labor and capital should be abolished, since they violate the exclusive right that each individual has to the fruits of his own labor.","filename":"capita","ext":".jpg","w":571,"h":290,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":63,"tim":1493913650868,"time":1493913650,"md5":"W72SLUCJ6GP4ILTMYuThWw==","fsize":68580,"resto":124051020,"id":"5utW0pPH","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124074342,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)12:04:22","name":"What is Geolibertarianism?","com":"<a href=\"#p124073979\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124073979<\/a><br>Sick memes bro<br><br>The classical liberal distinctions between land, labor and capital were greatly confused by socialists, and particularly Marxists, who substituted the fuzzy abstract term, &quot;means of production,&quot; for all three factors.

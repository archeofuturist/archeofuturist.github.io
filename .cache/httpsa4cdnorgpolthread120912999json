It makes you look like an authoritarian dictator. Thats not an exaggeration, it would forever taint him if the instant he got into office after the roughest campaign in American history he started arrested political enemies.<br><br>So yes, I do recognize that Trump did not appoint a special prosecutor on the first day of his presidency.<br><br>However, before you start celebrating and try to extrapolate on my statement, I still think he and the DoJ are going after her and Obama. Trump would not publicly call for an investigation into wiretapping if he were not serious. The investigation into the Clinton Foundation, her emails, and Obama&#039;s wrongdoings are still going on. You cannot deny that. They recently just got a warrant to view more of her emails and you just saw an Obama stooge get charged with Treason. The only &#039;evidence&#039; to support your claim is that Trump is not cheering for her to be locked up at stump speeches. Thats an incredibly flimsy argument to make.<br><br>It makes little difference to me or anyone else if Hillary Clinton is arrested on Day 1 or Day 200.

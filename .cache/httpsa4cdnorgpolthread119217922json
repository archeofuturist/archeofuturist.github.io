inequality.<br>The base of this system is that all workers get paid based on the time they work,the difficulty of their work and time spent learning to perform that work.So the value of products in this system is determined only by the factors stated above.So<br>Salary=worktime*workdifficulty(ment<wbr>al and physical)+timespentlearningtowork(d<wbr>ivided of course between multiple salaries)-tax.Notice that the value of products produced doesnt effect salary.So if a job produces less than another job for the same work both workers would be paid the same by selling the product of the less productive job at a higher price.<br>From the above comes the second important part of this system.Because production is effected by equipment which equipment to aquire requires an already existing capital and also to prevent competition which would cause a deacrese in salary to those that their products remain unsold and would also lead to wasted work all job positions are handed out by the government which monitors supply and demand and acts accordingly.Also salaries for each job are decided by the goverment but not handed out by them unless of course they are buyers of your products.Any equipment required to work is also given by the goverment but is still property of the goverment.<br><br>Prt1","filename":"1-SuCING533VLJ8GpGL1rV5w","ext":".png","w":600,"h":554,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":230,"tim":1491151931703,"time":1491151931,"md5":"e2jzm49JsbWWZbT6p2YZMA==","fsize":65836,"resto":0,"id":"NB\/qkaP2","country":"CY","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"so-pol-ive-been-making-in-my-mind-lately-an","country_name":"Cyprus","replies":23,"images":1,"unique_ips":10},{"no":119218215,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)12:55:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a

infastructure and also to improve it by funding reseasrch.Improved infastructure would lead to increased production for the same amount of work.<br>Also i forgot.Any product that does not and cant exist in sufficient quantities to meet demand will have have a buying limit.This means an individual can buy only so much of this product unless another individual doesnt want any.In that case the product meant for that individual is rendered accessible to be bought by others.<br>I know that like almost any system this system is vulnerable to fraud but due to the small amount of wealth and assets under each persons ownership or care(in case of goverment assets) an important amount of money can never be stolen from the system.<br>Also i know that in the present state of the world even if this system indeed works the goym wouldnt be allowed to implement it as it removes the ability of a jew to have more money than what his work is worth.<br>So thats about it.What do you think

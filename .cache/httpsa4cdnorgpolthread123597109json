The area is dominated by grasslands, rivers and small belts of jungle. <br>The attitude against whites has become more peaceful in DRC, and they actually trust white people more than the Chinese that currently exploit their lands. The Kinshasa government is almost nonexistent outside of Kinshasa, and the officials in the villages is very corrupt. <br>We would need people with some serious survival skills, also skills in agriculture could be useful. <br>The first 10 years are going to be very harsh, and some of us will properly fall for diseases or die of other reasons. <br><br>Currently I am alone about the planning, but have been in contact with some interested South Africans and a few men from EU. <br>There will be sent scouts out the first May next year, and after that larger groups of settlers will follow. <br>Right now this is on a very early stage, and therefore don&#039;t expect all problems we face to have been solved already. <br><br>Please check our website, it will be updated with a blog soon!<br>www.newrhodesia.com<br><br>We are not planning an invasion of DRC, it is a peaceful settlement and we would do our best to strike a peaceful deal with the Kinshasa government!!!","filename":"2000px-Flag_of_Rhodesia.svg","ext":".png","w":2000,"h":1000,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493627665816,"time":1493627665,"md5":"5PUiLz4NWBZfjMcClDFSuQ==","fsize":262655,"resto":0,"id":"qwvpN74z","country":"DK","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"nrg-new-rhodesia-general","country_name":"Denmark","replies":8,"images":1,"unique_ips":5},{"no":123597212,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)04:35:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123597109\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123597109<\/a><br>why the fuck would you do it in the centre of Niggeristan?","time":1493627744,"resto":123597109,"id":"zud8avh8","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":123597540,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)04:40:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123597212\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123597212<\/a><br>Check the website mate.<br>http:\/\/newrhodesia.com\/75-2\/","filename":"Rhodesia_poster01","ext":".jpg","w":271,"h":300,"tn_w":112,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493628055497,"time":1493628055,"md5":"XL1vFpkfKm9OnvHy9kl6lQ==","fsize":42129,"resto":123597109,"id":"qwvpN74z","country":"DK","country_name":"Denmark"},{"no":123598191,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)04:50:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123597540\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123597540<\/a><br>Without professional farmers, mechanics etc your project will be doomed to fail.

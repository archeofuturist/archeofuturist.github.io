Multiple experts and even Israel had to admit that their progress was quite good over the last year. Once they reach that point they will be able to pressure the US and other countries. This is unacceptable for many countries and won&#039;t happen.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;If NK gets invaded to disable the nuclear program chances are high Seoul, one of the biggest cities in the world (10mio gooks), would be laid to ashes either by a nuke or artillery, since it&#039;s extremely close to the NK border. Same goes for other cities and bases in Japan. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;A regime change can&#039;t be done for the same reasons: As soon as the leaders of NK would realize their end is coming they would go batshit crazy.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Same goes for trade pressure \/ starving them with help from China e.g. since again, when the NK government would realize their reign is coming to an end they would probably kamikaze the whole country.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Preemptive nuclear strike disabling any chances to react is impossible, since it would draw the attention of the whole world, anger many countries, make China go batshit crazy and has overall horrible implications since millions of civilians would die.<\/span>","filename":"kim-jong-boom","ext":".jpg","w":236,"h":213,"tn_w":236,"tn_h":213,"tim":1491893058023,"time":1491893058,"md5":"p9As4osczZL2+AQkrrjzUg==","fsize":9883,"resto":0,"id":"udmlemmi","country":"DE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"bkg-best-korea-general-kim-jong-boom-edition","country_name":"Germany","replies":1,"images":1,"unique_ips":1},{"no":120565955,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)02:44:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"CURRENT NEWS:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;South Korea warns of \u2018greater provocations\u2019 by North Korea as tensions rise<\/span><br>http:\/\/www.theglobeandmail.com\/news<wbr>\/world\/south-korea-warns-of-greater<wbr>-provocations-by-north-korea-as-ten<wbr>sions-rise\/article34662939\/<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;North Korea issues warning as US strike group heads to Korean Peninsula<\/span><br>http:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2017\/04\/10\/polit<wbr>ics\/us-aircraft-carrier-carl-vinson<wbr>-north-korea-strike-capabilities\/in<wbr>dex.html<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;North Korea &#039;ready for war&#039; after US navy strike team redeploys<\/span><br>https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2<wbr>017\/apr\/11\/north-korea-ready-for-wa<wbr>r-us-navy-redeploys<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;North Korea vows &#039;catastrophic consequences&#039; for US aircraft carrier dispatch<\/span><br>http:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/world\/2017\/0<wbr>4\/11\/north-korea-vows-catastrophic-<wbr>consequences-for-us-aircraft-carrie<wbr>r-dispatch.html<br>https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2<wbr>017\/apr\/11\/north-korea-ready-for-wa<wbr>r-us-navy-redeploys","filename":"170213_north_korea","ext":".jpg","w":960,"h":684,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":89,"tim":1491893073349,"time":1491893073,"md5":"OJWVBRkEWy7BFhGtTprLkg==","fsize":237990,"resto":120565930,"id":"udmlemmi","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"}]}

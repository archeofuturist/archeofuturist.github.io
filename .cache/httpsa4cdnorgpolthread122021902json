I&#039;ll tell you.<br><br>Homosexuality is the result of a genetic disorder. Schizophrenia is also the result of a genetic disorder. Now, imagine for a moment, if you will, that the Government passed a law requiring you to indulge schizos in their delusions. Some homeless fuck on the street wobbles up to you one day and says he&#039;s Napoleon Bonaparte, and you have to agree despite knowing damn well that crazy bastard never once in his life conquered Egypt. But it&#039;s the law. How would you feel? What would this mean for society? How does it relate to gays? Because, despite homosexuality being a genetic disorder, everyone who is actually normal has to pretend homosexuals are good, normal people. Because it&#039;s the law. So what are gays doing about their disorder? Are they demanding Government funding for discovering a cure for their sexual abnormality? Of course not! But even the schizophrenic, who has absolutely no grasp on reality, will eventually seek treatment! How worse off are the gays, who are more deluded and confused than the mentally ill. No. The faggot rubs his abominable, unnatural sexuality in the face of society. When we otherwise wouldn&#039;t care about his sexuality, he rubs it in our faces and makes sure we know just how big of a queer he is. And lastly, what&#039;s worst than all, is the fact gays are more likely to catch sexually transmitted diseases, be raped, indulge in pedophilia, and get murdered than heterosexual people. But does this humble the gay community? Of course not! They hide their fear of AIDS by acting flamboyant, once again making sure you know they&#039;re gay, as they double-down on degeneracy.<br><br>That&#039;s why gays are bad and God will one day destroy them (by providing man with a cure for homosexuality).","filename":"gay stats","ext":".jpg","w":3099,"h":1854,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":74,"tim":1492712647374,"time":1492712647,"md5":"mZ9VVXYLT93i7zz340mlhg==","fsize":802200,"resto":122021902,"id":"IInceXR5","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":122023201,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)14:24:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122022941\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122022941<\/a><br><a href=\"#p122023100\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122023100<\/a><br>I never said if I was for or against it my dudes","time":1492712656,"resto":122021902,"id":"FeM14Nw4","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":122023247,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)14:24:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"someone change the nazi to isis","time":1492712677,"resto":122021902,"id":"jBaNtZQO","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122023315,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)14:25:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122023201\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122023201<\/a><br>didnt have to, fag","time":1492712708,"resto":122021902,"id":"jBaNtZQO","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122023456,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)14:26:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122021902\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122021902<\/a><br>i oppose this because it doesn&#039;t use our \/pol\/-tan, and instead uses lgbt&#039;s old version of \/pol\/-tan because they don&#039;t have any drawfags anymore apparently","time":1492712787,"resto":122021902,"id":"uWdMwnZy","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122023533,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)14:27:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"Justify this fags.

The ones I do know are totally ostracized by faggots or would be if they told them how they really feel (don&#039;t agree with gay &quot;marriage&quot;, adoption etc). I&#039;ve also never known any be in a romantic relationship together or at least not in the traditional sense. Do they live together? Yes. Do they still have multiple partners and spread disease at an incredible rate? Yes.<br>In a way the ones who are honorary redpilled suffer from the same problem as the majority of \/pol\/. If an HRF told their true feelings to the fag community they would be ostracized for their views, though the HRF wouldn&#039;t ostracize completely degenerate fags for the views they hold. That&#039;s similar to most of \/pol\/, because while the majority of posters would identify as National Socialist (or at the very very least nationalists) they wouldn&#039;t immediately cut ties with someone who disagrees with their views, but the reverse IS true and happens almost constantly. How many times have you been on faceberg and seen &quot;just had to have a good clear out of the racists from my friends list&quot;? These people are braindead, can&#039;t see they&#039;re everything they claim to oppose, and while I want to see them fail, I don&#039;t wish to see them dead (unless we turn complete Sweden tier). Even if I said I did want to see them dead wouldn&#039;t that be expected from a &quot;Nazi&quot; or a &quot;racist&quot; anyway, at least in their eyes? And yet they preach the opposite while being worse than those the demonize. Like I said they&#039;re braindead.

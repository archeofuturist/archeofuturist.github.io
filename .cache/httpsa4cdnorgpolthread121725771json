BoJo, Amber Rudd, Philip Hammond are all there because they have some influence within the party which allows her to gather enough votes to push the least controversial legislations through. They&#039;re all awful at their jobs and a reshuffle under these circumstances would most likely result in she losing support from within the party. <br><br>It is virtually impossible to get a decent post-Brexit environment with these idiots in charge of such important departments. Rudd is incapable of implementing anything remotely right wing and she seems to be under the impression the electorate gives a fuck about non-issues like the made up &quot;pay gap&quot; or sex workers exploitation. Johnson is a clown plain and simple and May knows he isn&#039;t taken seriously in any country he travels to. Hammond is a closet socialist and that became obvious from his last budget statement. <br><br>Having said all this, she is taking a huge gamble. Yes Labour is in disarray and the &quot;&quot;&quot;polls&quot;&quot;&quot; show the conservatives are comfortably ahead of everyone else, but having won an election in 2015 it will be very difficult to convince tory voters to show up in large numbers to vote.

In 2019, towards the end of the Brexit negotiations (we get two years to thrash out the deal, according to the Article 50 terms, which we&#039;ve already triggered), the Tories will have to fight an election - the 2020 election which is currently scheduled. The Tories might be less popular in the polls then, in which case, the EU will be able to bully the Tory party, because they&#039;ll say &quot;haha!

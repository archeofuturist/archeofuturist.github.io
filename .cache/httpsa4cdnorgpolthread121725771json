BoJo, Amber Rudd, Philip Hammond are all there because they have some influence within the party which allows her to gather enough votes to push the least controversial legislations through. They&#039;re all awful at their jobs and a reshuffle under these circumstances would most likely result in she losing support from within the party. <br><br>It is virtually impossible to get a decent post-Brexit environment with these idiots in charge of such important departments. Rudd is incapable of implementing anything remotely right wing and she seems to be under the impression the electorate gives a fuck about non-issues like the made up &quot;pay gap&quot; or sex workers exploitation. Johnson is a clown plain and simple and May knows he isn&#039;t taken seriously in any country he travels to. Hammond is a closet socialist and that became obvious from his last budget statement. <br><br>Having said all this, she is taking a huge gamble. Yes Labour is in disarray and the &quot;&quot;&quot;polls&quot;&quot;&quot; show the conservatives are comfortably ahead of everyone else, but having won an election in 2015 it will be very difficult to convince tory voters to show up in large numbers to vote. People are never enthusiastic about voting for the status quo as opposed to all the angry hippies, remoaners and trade union drones who are have become extremely butthurt over everything that has been going on over the last 2 years and will definitely be more motivated to vote. <br><br>My bet: Tories win a majority, but not too different from the one they have now.","time":1492545167,"resto":121725771,"id":"0M0N1Xyy","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121730578,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)15:56:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121725771\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121725771<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121728223\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121728223<\/a><br>I see it very differently.

I mean for fuck&#039;s sake, it&#039;s politics 101 that a campaign will radically change what the polls look like now. It&#039;s also politics 101 that complacency is electoral suicide (just look at Hillary Clinton who thought no one could POSSIBLY vote for the alternative).

Perhaps it is the Greens as well.<br><br>May&#039;s being fucking arrogant here and I think it will backfire. I think it will blow up in her face just like David Cameron&#039;s referendum - another vote that was called out of arrogance.

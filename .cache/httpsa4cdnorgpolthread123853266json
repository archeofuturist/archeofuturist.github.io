Benavidez heard the radio appeal for help and boarded a helicopter to respond. Armed only with a knife, he jumped from the helicopter carrying his medical bag and ran to help the trapped patrol. Benavidez &quot;distinguished himself by a series of daring and extremely valorous actions... and because of his gallant choice to join voluntarily his comrades who were in critical straits, to expose himself constantly to withering enemy fire, and his refusal to be stopped despite numerous severe wounds, saved the lives of at least eight men.&quot; At one point in the battle an NVA soldier accosted him and stabbed him with his bayonet. Benavidez pulled it out, yanked out his own knife, killed him and kept going, leaving his knife in the NVA soldier&#039;s body. After the battle, he was evacuated to the base camp, examined, and thought to be dead. As he was placed in a body bag among the other dead in body bags, he was suddenly recognized by a friend who called for help. A doctor came and examined him but believed Benavidez was dead. The doctor was about to zip up the body bag when Benavidez managed to spit in his face, alerting the doctor that he was alive.[3](see medal citation below) Benavidez had a total of 37 separate bullet, bayonet, and shrapnel wounds from the six-hour fight with the enemy battalion.[4]<\/span><br><br>Call me when you&#039;ve got roaches this

Durka Durka, the intrepid Turkroach, heard the sound of his comrades calling for help through their tin cans tied together with string from the hair of a camel spider. Armed with only his five year old concubine, he jumped from his magic carpet carrying his koran and ran to help the trapped patrol. Durka &quot;distinguished himself by running away while shitting himself and began aggressively fucking a goat, forsaking the lives of all 18 men (and 32 camels).&quot; At one point in the goat orgy, the dominant male accosted him and stabbed him up the ass with its horns. Durka pulled it out, yanked out his own dick, stabbed the goat, and kept going, leaving his dong in the animal&#039;s body. After the goat-orgy, he was evacuated by Swedish UN workers, bathed, and praised as a champion of animal rights by German Chancellor Angela Merkel. As he was placed in the tub to wash the semen and goat blood off his body, he managed to spit in the UN worker&#039;s face before pulling a hand grenade out of his ass and screaming &quot;ALLAHU ACKBAR&quot; and blowing the entire tent up. A goat was later found with a total of 37 separate kinds of body fluids in its fur from the six-hour raping.<\/span>","time":1493778276,"resto":123853266,"id":"Ba0ZHWDh","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123857833,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)22:24:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"This kills the American.","filename":"762x39BULK","ext":".jpg","w":359,"h":249,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":86,"tim":1493778282841,"time":1493778282,"md5":"Cch7aSxjIO7WEWvk9vWh5w==","fsize":19809,"resto":123853266,"id":"7o90n1jo","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123857844,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)22:24:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123857615\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123857615<\/a><br>Dude I&#039;m a normal person.

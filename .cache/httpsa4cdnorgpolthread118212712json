Cap it at $10000 for the young, and graduate it upwards as you age. Separate, catastrophic plans optionally available from the free market, which will by it&#039;s nature will be very cheap. If you need more, and you didn&#039;t plan ahead, you lose your house and savings as God intended, but you either pay the hospital bill or go to a halfway house until you work it off.<br>The only .gov involvement is the law about the paycheck deduction. But unlike social security taxes, it doesn&#039;t go to the government, it goes to an account in your name. Just like a retirement account, no taxes until it&#039;s used, and then only if it&#039;s not used for medical expenses.<br>Not ideal, but this means I don&#039;t have to pay for the people who put an iphone and data plan ahead of anything else.","filename":"aca","ext":".jpg","w":480,"h":607,"tn_w":197,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490438596811,"time":1490438596,"md5":"6AhOVVw+lWo+6HL8ww560g==","fsize":29423,"resto":0,"id":"D70manb9","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-health-care-bill-should-be-a-mandated-health","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

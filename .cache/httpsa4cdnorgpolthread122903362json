Of the 1.7 million people worldwide who die from unsafe water, sanitation, and hygiene each year, more than 600,000 are in India.<\/span><br><br>The are literally keeping track of toilets by geotagging<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;So far, the progress is impressive. In 2014, when Clean India began, just 42 percent of Indians had access to proper sanitation. Today 63 percent do. And the government has a detailed plan to finish the job by October 2, 2019, the 150th anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi\u2019s birth. Officials know which states are on track and which are lagging behind, thanks to a robust reporting system that includes photographing and geotagging each newly installed toilet.<\/span><br><br>And my favourite part he says word for word that Indians are hard to convince to use toiletes because of habits<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;But giving people access to toilets isn\u2019t enough. You also have to persuade them to use the toilets. That\u2019s the second key to Clean India, and in some ways it is even harder than the first. People can be reluctant to change old habits.<\/span><br><br>And the ways they are trying to convince Indians to poo in loo got me on the floor crying from laughter<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Clean India has ingenious ways of tackling that problem. In some communities, groups of children band together to call out people who are defecating in the open and encourage them to use public toilets instead. In a pilot project that will be expanded next year, the government worked with Google so users in 11 cities could search online for the nearest public toilets, get directions, and read reviews by other users. On streets throughout the country, billboards remind passers-by of the mission. Stars from Bollywood films and cricket teams speak out on TV and radio. Even India\u2019s currency features the Swachh Bharat (Clean India) logo.<\/span>","filename":"Pooinlooland","ext":".png","w":1600,"h":1600,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493224464052,"time":1493224464,"md5":"py8AcWruaXjHYg2ZduY4Vw==","fsize":438271,"resto":0,"id":"MUTYfXkJ","country":"RS","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"india-trying-to-put-poo-in-loo-by-2019","country_name":"Serbia","replies":6,"images":2,"unique_ips":4},{"no":122903562,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)12:35:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"Forgot the original link: https:\/\/www.gatesnotes.com\/Developm<wbr>ent\/Indias-War-on-Human-Waste?WT.mc<wbr>_id=20170426121400_IndiaHumanWaste_<wbr>BG-FB&amp;WT.tsrc=BGFB&amp;linkId=36904840","time":1493224546,"resto":122903362,"id":"MUTYfXkJ","country":"RS","country_name":"Serbia"},{"no":122903642,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)12:36:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Be India<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Become superpower in a next few years<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;cant poo in loo<\/span>","time":1493224585,"resto":122903362,"id":"V614pxEq","country":"CZ","country_name":"Czech Republic"},{"no":122903836,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)12:38:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122903642\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122903642<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Super power by 2020<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Poo in loo by 2019<\/span>","time":1493224685,"resto":122903362,"id":"MUTYfXkJ","country":"RS","country_name":"Serbia"},{"no":122903998,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)12:39:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122903362\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122903362<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;But giving people access to toilets isn\u2019t enough.

I KNOW --as in I proved it to myself-- that everything below is factual. One day this will be common-knowledge.<br><br>A gay guy made a recent post asking how he can stop being gay. I don&#039;t think that&#039;s important --that he should stop being gay-- but I wanted him to read my reply:<br><br>Inside of every person is a demon called the EGO, and this demon overlaps the body as if it is the body. This demon can be straight, gay, bi, trans, et cetera. So that&#039;s why you have men identifying as women, because the demon inside of them is a succubus. (female demon with wings, or the like) This demon&#039;s true form is seen in the dream-state or half-sleep state. It also can induce lucid wet-dreams. (See movies: Monsters Inc. and Ink)<br><br>So this is why you have all these &quot;genders&quot; because the demon within is a narcissist and wants to be special inside of YOUR body, and because (literally) if you&#039;re a chick, and you have an incubus inside of you, then you might like women because you have male desires.<br><br>This topic is ancient but you can find more on this subject below: <br><br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Three<wbr>_Corpses","filename":"Jesus-shroud","ext":".jpg","w":400,"h":500,"tn_w":200,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491945327911,"time":1491945327,"md5":"Mv4TegPst6xO\/Nz3lFHJ3w==","fsize":20001,"resto":0,"id":"knlYb71c","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"taoism-and-the-3-worms","country_name":"United States","replies":12,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":120659039,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)17:20:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"oh wow let s have a spirits thread. cause something you can t measure with instruments. is scholarly as heck.","time":1491945607,"resto":120658358,"id":"tj+WCa00","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120659204,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)17:21:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120659039\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120659039<\/a><br><br>This isn&#039;t a religious thread.

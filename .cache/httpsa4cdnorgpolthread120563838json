It wants to be left unimpeded. There&#039;s a big difference. Russia has every intention of interacting with other nations, including militarily. But only under its own terms with a position of absolute dominance. Its attitude is imperial, not isolationist.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Plenty of nations Russia involved itself in, by contrast, actually did want to just be left alone. If Russia really wants to be left alone, it has to start by . . . leaving them alone. As long as it doesn&#039;t, they have every reason and right to do anything and everything they can to counter it.<\/span>","time":1491891758,"resto":120563838,"id":"ETUDL2oU","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120564159,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)02:23:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120563838\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120563838<\/a><br>Protip: NEVER place your trust in jews, including USrael.","time":1491891824,"resto":120563838,"id":"I7MoMh+l","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120564614,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)02:29:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120563838\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120563838<\/a><br>That was the Tsar&#039;s Russia.

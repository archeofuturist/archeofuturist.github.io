Language, first and foremost. If you try to speak someone&#039;s language, and they can see you&#039;re actually trying, they won&#039;t give you a hard time.<br>Besides that, once I had basic communication established, it would just be a matter of trial and error. Every culture has different unwritten rules that the natives know, but foreigners do not. I&#039;d just ask around for certian things like that.<br><br>Now, I know it isn&#039;t this easy. People coming from Asia and Africa might have a hard time learning the language, as they don&#039;t have the same resources I do. Furthermore, the culture they come from could be completely different, and the person depends on the country. A refugee from war-torn Syria might behave a little different than an Anarchy raised Somali.<br><br>But, it&#039;s still not that fucking hard, right? Once the refugees are established in the country, they have the resources they need. Especially the cucktries that hand over everything to them. <br><br>The fact is that these refugees are HORRIBLY over-pampered. They can&#039;t even try to learn the language or anything because they&#039;re so fucking stubborn.<br><br>What do you guys think?

Attacking Turkish villages etc. They were supported by Russia. Quick way to get rid of Armenian rebels were to deport them, Ottoman put them on a long walk. Many of them died on the way and executed. Was it a genocide? I don&#039;t know, I heard both sides refuse to investigate it and open their archives.","time":1490302620,"resto":117980722,"id":"lZ0H0rcs","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117982390,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)16:59:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117982069\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117982069<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I have conducted a series of conversations with competent and influential Turkish personages, and these are my impressions: A large segment of the Ittihadist [Young Turk] party maintains the viewpoint that the Turkish empire should be based only on the principle of Islam and Pan-Turkism. Its non-Muslim and non-Turkish inhabitants should either be forcibly islamized, or otherwise they ought to be destroyed. These gentlemen believe that the time is propitious for the realization of this plan. The first item on this agenda concerns the liquidation of the Armenians. Ittihad will dangle before the Allies a specter of an alleged revolution prepared by the Armenian Dashnak party. Moreover, local incidents of social unrest and acts of Armenian self defense will deliberately be provoked and inflated and will be used as pretexts to effect the deportations. Once en route, however, the convoys will be attacked and exterminated by Kurdish and Turkish brigands, and in part by gendarmes, who will be instigated for that purpose by Ittihad.[140]<\/span>","time":1490302749,"resto":117980722,"id":"60x\/oTZ1","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

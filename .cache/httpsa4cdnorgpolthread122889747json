It&#039;s going to be an RPG based on some gay urban fantasy stuff, but the reason I&#039;m bringing it up is that it&#039;s set in alt-history Germany during WWII. The decision came out of the blue because the visual design lead really likes that era&#039;s aesthetics, originally we were going to set it in 19th century London, but now it&#039;s in fantasy Berlin. A lot more airships than historical WWII.<br><br>All of the historical research, writing, and setting information has been put in my hands, because I&#039;m the only one who knows or cares at all about history. The game will have readable books, posters, conversations with NPCs for flavor, and a plot about vampires and lovecraftian shit that needs to be entwined with the setting for it to make sense.<br><br>The question is: How do I turn this into subtle NatSoc propaganda. I can&#039;t just go full 1488 because that would be obvious, the Nazis still have to be one of the antagonist factions, but this is a rare opportunity to portray them in a neutral, even slightly positive light.<br><br>Advice? What were some good things about fascism to emphasize? Particularly things which would resonate well with people today.","filename":"Adolf_Hitler","ext":".jpg","w":1165,"h":1549,"tn_w":188,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493217440935,"time":1493217440,"md5":"XgWUbsLQm\/DxZC07COgnqA==","fsize":139343,"resto":0,"id":"UrRJkKCf","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"covert-nazi-propaganda","country_name":"United States","replies":5,"images":1,"unique_ips":5},{"no":122890365,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)10:43:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"Just focus on the positive aspects of nazi germany like nice archidecture, trad women, proud soldiers etc. don&#039;t include anything related to jews or any worded-out propaganda. Play it out as if your goal is to portray alt-historical period from mere fictional interest, don&#039;t promote any &quot;redpill facts&quot; or &quot;moral of the story&quot; kind of stuff. Think about Man in The High Castle, not The Greatest Story Never Told, because normies will take this the wrong way if you include too obvious imagery, propaganda posters or suggestive wording.

Such reactors also present proliferation and nuclear terrorism risks because they involve the continuous separation, or &quot;reprocessing,&quot; of the fuel to remove fission products and to efficiently produce U-233, which is a nuclear weapon-usable material. Moreover, disposal of the used fuel has turned out to be a major challenge.

Since no infrastructure currently exists in the U.S. for thorium-based fuels, and the processing of thorium-based fuels is at a lower level of technical maturity when compared to processing of uranium-based fuels, costs and RD&amp;D [research, development and deployment] requirements for using thorium are anticipated to be higher. <br><br>Thorium 232 is not fissile, that means it can&#039;t split and create power.

While nuclear reactors do not generate sooty particles that wind up in the atmosphere, the heavy dependence on cooling water for nuclear power plants makes nuclear power unfeasible as water temperatures rise around the globe.

It had nothing to do with any inherent faults in the design of their reactors.<br><br>When the earthquake hit, the three reactors that were active were automatically shut down straight away. However, although the reactor was shut down, the fuel in the reactor continues to generate heat through nuclear decay, and since the reactors had shut down, the cooling system could not draw power from the site&#039;s grid, so the emergency backup diesel generators were fired up to keep the cooling system running.<br><br>Now comes the problem. Whilst building a nuclear plant right on the coast, 50 miles from an active undersea fault line is already a retarded idea, TEPCO went full retard and situated the emergency backup generators in one of the basement levels. While the plant didn&#039;t sustain any real damage during the earthquake itself, the tsunami arrived just under an hour later, flooding the basement levels and killing the backup generators. Without anything powering the cooling systems, the three reactors that were shut down quickly overheated and began to melt down, and the rest is history. If the site had been situated 10 miles inland, literally nothing would have happened. The reactors would have automatically shut down when the earthquake hit, the backup generators would have kept the cooling systems running and the reactors would have been started up again once they had been checked for any damage.<br><br>TL;DR - the incident happened not because of any inherent safety risks or failures with the reactors themselves, but because TEPCO built it in a retarded location that essentially made it an accident just waiting to happen.","time":1493250970,"resto":122955298,"id":"Ao3Ue5N4","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122960992,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)19:56:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122958454\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122958454<\/a><br>This thread was worth it just for your replies burger bro","time":1493250983,"resto":122955298,"id":"vLAAVuqO","country":"NZ","country_name":"New Zealand"},{"no":122961090,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)19:57:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122955843\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122955843<\/a><br>Actually you dolt, the smoke stack at the front of a steam engine literally is smoke.

According to El Paso Intelligence Center (EPIC) drug seizure data, most of the cocaine, foreign-source marijuana and methamphetamine, and Mexican-source heroin available in the United States is smuggled into the country across the SWB. The SWB is particularly vulnerable to drug smuggling because of the enormous volume of people and goods legitimately crossing the border between the two countries every day. Moreover, large sections of the nearly 2,000-mile land border between Mexico and the United States are both vast and remote, and this provides additional smuggling opportunities for Mexican DTOs. Once at the border, Mexican traffickers use every method imaginable to smuggle drugs into this country including aircraft, backpackers, couriers, horses and mules, maritime vessels, rail, tunnels, and vehicles.","time":1493124143,"resto":122728611,"id":"boi+Z51u","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122729805,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)08:42:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122729453\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122729453<\/a><br>straight from the horse&#039;s mouth! shills can&#039;t spin this. donny always delivers","time":1493124156,"resto":122728611,"id":"dVs+8XEL","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122729806,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)08:42:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"Somebody get Kasich some pancakes already","time":1493124157,"resto":122728611,"id":"vJ\/2tr77","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122729808,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)08:42:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;122729732<\/span><br>DIE HELLSPAWN DIE.","time":1493124157,"resto":122728611,"id":"ZVGMfipS","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122729856,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)08:43:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122729617\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122729617<\/a><br>No one cares about you favela monkeys.

The belief that all life originated from one singular tiny spec, possibly a single atom, which exploded, creating things where there were never things, nobody knows how or why it burst out like this, but the evidence points to it.<br>Through millions of years slowly, as things tossed from the explosions eventually came to rest, in space, the rocks, gasses, metals and all other debris from the blast began to slowly form into planets, stars, astroid belts, and whatever else floats out there. Eventually, on earth, lifeforms arose that were extremely simple, lifeforms which would gain nutrients, replicate, and gain nutrients, and replicate, and repeat and repeat, until eventually there was a mutation that gave it a special ability that put it above the other replicates. Through trillions of mutations, differents types of these cells in different parts of the oceans began to grow different traits. Some were more resistant to cold, others faster moving, some could replicate very quickly, etc etc etc etc, they would change and adapt to their environment. Eventually, these organisms began to resemble fish, and as the oceans were getting overcrowded for food, some moved onto land. The process was repeated there, as these lifeforms began to crop up in all parts of the world, and slowly evolved into dinosaurs, birds, insects, and whatever else. All life is connected, and this can be proven through DNA, fossil evidence, and rock dating. We can find rocks that have residue from the blast, we can find step by step species that grew and adapted to become better, we can see this by studying the earth.<br>Instead of study however, you would prefer to cling to a book that gives you a bunch of safe answers, so you don&#039;t have to use your pweshus wittle bwain too much, and so you don&#039;t have to be afraid of death, and other scary things.<br>You are a sad strange little man and you have my pity. <br>Farewell.","time":1492911437,"resto":122358376,"id":"vQXBHL7r","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122359947,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)21:38:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122359730\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122359730<\/a><br>EXACTLY, we don&#039;t know, so we assume it&#039;s not true.","time":1492911502,"resto":122358376,"id":"aa2f6rT5","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122360036,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)21:39:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122359813\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122359813<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The belief that all life originated from one singular tiny spec<\/span><br><br>Not life, the universe.<br>Stop giving the retards ideas.","time":1492911556,"resto":122358376,"id":"aa2f6rT5","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122360135,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)21:40:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122359813\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122359813<\/a><br>Well I should correct myself, thats what most atheists believe.

Then in that bloodline, another fish is born with gills strong enough to keep the fish alive while it&#039;s on land.

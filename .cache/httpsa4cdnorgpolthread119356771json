Secondly, education goes at the bottom. Work experience goes at the top. Your GPA is low so just keep it off of your resume. If you get asked your GPA, just say it was a 3.0. I never check GPA&#039;s and I highly doubt any employer will.<br><br>2) &quot;Work Life&quot;<br>WTF IS THIS??? I&#039;m starting to think you&#039;re just trolling us. It is &quot;Work Experience&quot;, not work life lol. Your job descriptions are too vague. You should have at least 4-5 bullet points MINIMUM describing what you did at those jobs.<br><br>3) Skills is fine, although you should elaborate more on them. I see you&#039;re skilled in computers, but how so? I can type on a fucking keyboard and use a mouse and browse facebook, does that mean I&#039;m skilled in computers too?<br><br>4) &quot;Extracurriculurs&quot;<br>Take that the fuck off of your resume. I don&#039;t want anyone that was in a fucking debate club working for me. I&#039;m not employing you to debate, I&#039;m employing you to make me money, bitch.<br><br>5) &quot;Hobbies&quot;<br>Take that off. You&#039;re legit describing yourself as a NEET and I think it&#039;s hilarious but take it off. Do you fuck your family and friends? WHY IS THAT A HOBBY? Take hobbies off of your shit.","filename":"anbMKqE_700b","ext":".jpg","w":700,"h":833,"tn_w":105,"tn_h":124,"tim":1491243299078,"time":1491243299,"md5":"pqFmPkDMI6SvBot9Rdg5mA==","fsize":123156,"resto":119356771,"id":"vS83Y4Pv","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119358844,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)14:15:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"bait","time":1491243334,"resto":119356771,"id":"HYfrRLa9","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":119358915,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)14:16:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119356771\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119356771<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I HAVE AN ENGINERS DEGREE FFS<\/span><br>What kind of engineer are you?","time":1491243364,"resto":119356771,"id":"eVzLYcNu","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":119358933,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)14:16:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119356771\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119356771<\/a><br>This might be the worst resume i&#039;ve ever read.","time":1491243374,"resto":119356771,"id":"f\/4qjr7s","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":119358937,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)14:16:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119358701\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119358701<\/a><br>I hate MLP motherfuckers but I&#039;d actually interview him and grill the shit out of him.

They would spend weeks if not months translating specific, single verses of the bible and going over all available manuscripts and cross-examining with other passages of scripture. As far as I know all of the people involved with the translation were polymaths in one way or another: most spoke 3, 4, 5 languages, had written books in theology, philosophy, had a background in archaeology, etc., etc. There&#039;s more that I&#039;m forgetting I&#039;m sure. My point is that the translation process was incredibly tight and they spent year after year hammering down the most accurate word-for-word translation.<br><br>The KJV is a trustworthy translation when you understand the history of how it came to be. Especially when you compare the 50+ polymaths against the 2-person-&quot;new&quot;-translation teams making the &quot;updated&quot; versions. 50+ geniuses vs 1 kikeberg.

He is stalling on all fronts, unable to deliver on any of his campaign promises. Trump has only made concessions since taking office, many on the wall. He offers only excuses.<br>This is all happening because Trump is incompetent in office and that is ok. Trump reminds me of the real George W. Bush. The world may remember Bush as a stupid man who blundered into a war for oil, but he was a sincere president and an unwavering American. Bush never accomplished anything in office and Trump won&#039;t even try. Trump can keep America stable for the next 8 years, but that&#039;s the full extent of his ability.<br>However, Americans need a wall on the border.

Los Angeles, New York, and Chicago are all majority nonwhite and very diverse, with no ethnic group probably even having a majority in any city, but they&#039;re still fine cities that haven&#039;t fallen apart or anything and still function fine. The same could be said of probably any multiracial European city, they aren&#039;t hellholes and still work out, people aren&#039;t dying en masse, people aren&#039;t becoming noticeably poorer, etc.","filename":"LatinaQTs1","ext":".jpg","w":540,"h":960,"tn_w":140,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493498519315,"time":1493498519,"md5":"Y5YSU0a6VghEClzUp46OiQ==","fsize":60836,"resto":0,"id":"HDnEi5Ry","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"realistically-does-mass-immigration-or","country_name":"United States","replies":7,"images":2,"unique_ips":7},{"no":123378761,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)16:42:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"I take it you&#039;ve never really visited LA, New York, or Chicago.","time":1493498565,"resto":123378677,"id":"BoYi5fM9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123379577,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)16:49:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123378677\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123378677<\/a><br>It means that whites don&#039;t have any real supremacy, at least not the whites below Master Level.<br><br>Yet white supremacy is a regular boogey man trotted out my mass media to justify whites surrendering control of any area where they dominate demographically.<br><br>Why the deception?

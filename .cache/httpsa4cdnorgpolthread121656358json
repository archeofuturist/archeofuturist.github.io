In fact, we&#039;re currently in the middle of an oil surplus, because Saudi Arabia is overproducing for political reasons. Hence why oil is fairly cheap right now. &quot;War for oil&quot; is a meme. The US doesn&#039;t invade countries with the intention of nefariously stealing their oil supply; the vast majority of our oil imports come from Canada and South America. The US mostly goes to war to maintain its diplomatic hegemony and keep the value of the dollar stable.

The EROI has shrunk massively in the last decade alone. The United States burns approximately 20 million barrels of oil per day. Faggots on this board have zero understanding of just how finite a lot of resources on Earth are. Scientists have been warning for decades about the the ridiculous unsustainability of our civilization, and they are eventually going to be right. <br><br>Humans are finally going to figure out what happens when you don&#039;t control your population and you just let people shit out kids with no real plan. This autistic board loves to go on and on about 3rd world shitskins having 10 kids, but those families don&#039;t use even a tenth of the resources that one child born in America uses throughout their life time. Think about all the stupid shit your parents bought you as a kid that you simply out grew or was just thrown in the trash.<br><br>This century will likely devastate Western civilization, bringing it to it&#039;s knees. It was unavoidable, there was always one major flaw in our socioeconomic system: You can&#039;t base an economy on unlimited growth on a planet with finite resources. It was there staring us in the face the whole time, and we will pay dearly for our mistakes. The oil wars of the early 00s will be nothing compared to the water wars that are coming, all of the worlds aquifers are being sucked dry, and don&#039;t replenish for millions of years.

Everybody in my family is a Bernie Sanders supporter or a far left thinking individual (maybe because I&#039;m from Seattle).

If you do do something that will improve the country you could put regulation on the program such as: You need to keep a high grade, need to work in the country twice as long as your course, need to keep a attendance record, if you quit you have to pay the program. If you break any of these rules you must pay the school system. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Media, just disprove the shit they say.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Homeless add into immigration.<\/span>","time":1493849965,"resto":123972573,"id":"DZDkhIR9","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]}

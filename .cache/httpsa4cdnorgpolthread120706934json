A good example is why was Hiroshima getting nuked okay but nukes today are bad - and the answer is quite simple.<br><br>The theory of &#039;Just War&#039; has very simple principles. <br>Any action during a war which leads to a swift end of the conflict is justified. Atomic bombings against Japan ended the war, so it&#039;s justified. If the USA nuked, say, Tehran willy nilly, that would not be justified because of the consequences that would follow - which leads to the next principle of Just War. <br><br>Any action which intensifies the war - which causes more parties to be drawn in than previous - is unjustified. Why was the Bombing of Pearl Harbor against the Just War Theory - not necessarily morally wrong but just practically wrong? Because it brought an isolationist US into WW2 and led to the invasion of Italy and Germany, Japan&#039;s allies.<br><br>We can see this in the case of the Syria conflict. Assad&#039;s bombing campaign, and really it doesn&#039;t matter if it was a chemical attack or not because gas and explosions kill all the same, is reckless and has drawn the US into the conflict. And while Putin can bitch and moan about the US airstrike, Russia was already involved.<br><br>So Trump&#039;s action in Syria was justified in certain interpretations. Trump&#039;s strike has made it clear to Assad that the bombing of civilians will not be tolerated but Assad can continue to use the airfield to hit ISIS.<br><br>Of course, one could criticize Trump for involving the US by interpreting the airstrike as unprevoked, but that relies on certainty that chemical weapons are not in Syria. Not &#039;used&#039;, &#039;in&#039;. ISIS responding to Syrian bombing with chemical weapons would intensify the conflict, which is why Trump believed he needed to get involved.<br><br>Interpret it either way, but pretending Trump was obligated to never ever bomb anyone or just started WW3 is silly.","filename":"1483064714625","ext":".jpg","w":816,"h":1024,"tn_w":199,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491967805420,"time":1491967805,"md5":"T4z+Ayi8e\/Iwt+poyTWDmw==","fsize":84195,"resto":0,"id":"NfftPs58","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"what-shareblue-shills-and-isolationist-idiots","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":1,"unique_ips":2},{"no":120707745,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)23:37:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"tldr","filename":"4e63ea083ac9f5e89100c9c87f2a4053df86db83efa0d71cdcd6a797b9fdc991","ext":".gif","w":394,"h":222,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1491968225394,"time":1491968225,"md5":"L4DAsGjGGFKH882jIuqaLw==","fsize":3295027,"resto":120706934,"id":"rkWk9chC","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

People merely want to shame Trump with allegations of racism, sexism, etc. How is that logical? Where&#039;s the proof? Why are his personal opinions important? What is he doing. What are his actions? That&#039;s important. He speaks in an unpolished manner. He doesn&#039;t have talking points like Obama-Bush-Clinton. Maybe that&#039;s a good thing. Maybe the American people hate being lied to... how&#039;s that for logic?","filename":"sort-yourself-out-bucko1","ext":".png","w":306,"h":242,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":98,"tim":1492055682068,"time":1492055682,"md5":"1D7D\/MgS5fcatgMUxIK0Jg==","fsize":124017,"resto":120842764,"id":"vgsMhBds","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120863133,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)23:55:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"I voted for trump because it would be funny to have him as president<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;mfw he got elected<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;mfw liberals think this is bait<\/span>","time":1492055724,"resto":120842764,"id":"tvlZ9Hpw","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120863414,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)23:58:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120863133\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120863133<\/a><br>Forgot pic","filename":"tumblr_inline_o0r600TuII1rcncm1_500","ext":".jpg","w":499,"h":499,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":124,"tim":1492055897506,"time":1492055897,"md5":"WqOuL\/iJWx2Q0x6v3SJjhw==","fsize":18721,"resto":120842764,"id":"tvlZ9Hpw","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120863451,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)23:58:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Do you support Trump because you actually believe him or just because you hate minorities, muslims, women and his agenda aligns with those dislikes?<\/span><br><br>Both.

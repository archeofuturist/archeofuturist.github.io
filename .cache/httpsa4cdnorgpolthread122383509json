actual voting is not to be taken as proof of consent, even for the time being. On the contrary, it is to be considered that, without his consent having ever been asked, a man finds himself environed by a government that he cannot resist; a government that forces him to pay money, render service, and forego the exercise of many of his natural rights, under peril of weighty punishments. He sees, too, that other men practise this tyranny over him by the use of the ballot. He sees further that, if he will but use the ballot himself, he has some chance of relieving himself from this tyranny of others, by subjecting them to his own. In short, he finds himself, without his consent, so situated that, if he use the ballot, he may become a master; if he does not use it, he must become a slave. And he has no other alternative than these two. In self-defence, he attempts the former. His case is analogous to that of a man who has been forced into battle, where he must either kill others, or be killed himself. Because, to save his own life in battle, a man attempts to take the lives of his opponents, it is not to be inferred that the battle is one of his own choosing. Neither in contests with the ballot -- which is a mere substitute for a bullet -- because, as his only chance of self-preservation, a man uses a ballot, is it to be inferred that the contest is one into which he voluntarily entered; that he voluntarily set up all his own natural rights, as a stake against those of others, to be lost or won by the mere power of numbers. On the contrary, it is to be considered that, in an exigency, into which he had been forced by others, and in which no other means of self-defence offered, he, as a matter of necessity, used the only one that was left to him.","time":1492925252,"resto":122383509,"id":"cQNRLl6f","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122385137,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)01:27:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122384122\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122384122<\/a><br>I need a name for that thiccness","time":1492925263,"resto":122383509,"id":"za0uRIRt","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122385156,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)01:27:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122384953\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122384953<\/a><br>It&#039;s fine when they do it, racist if we do it.

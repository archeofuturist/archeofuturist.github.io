Don&#039;t get me wrong, I&#039;m not saying \/pol\/fags are like plebian die hard Christians Cletus and his incest babies instead they are perfectly capable of realising that religion is for peasants but they try so hard to personalise their political fantasies they somehow manage to think otherwise. I don&#039;t care if you want to enforce Christianity, seeing it as a legit solution to todays problems but where do you lose your own logic and enforce it to yourself? You speak as you defend realism and say we should be able to speak our mind but I honestly can not see any other reason to legitimising Christians other than Political Correctness. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;inb4jew<\/span>","filename":"1492792753611","ext":".jpg","w":1141,"h":711,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":155,"tim":1493467776145,"time":1493467776,"md5":"e2dtcXB8AwbKIO5El2DYnA==","fsize":265810,"resto":0,"id":"KhmPeBAB","country":"FR","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"why-is-everybody-in-pol-such-a-i-was-raped-in","country_name":"France","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

In China capital is owned privately but controlled by the state through a shadow government and draconian regulation. In the USSR capital was owned by the state but controlled privately. Free markets are a consideration because capitalism by definition requires a free market, but although capitalism requires free markets, free markets do not require capitalism. Market socialism, or Strasserism, or a billion other ideas, are all ideologies that change the industrial relations inside firms and not the rivalrous relations between firms. Next time you think that the invisible hand of the market will fix it just remember that the invisible hand of the market works on all firms regardless of who owns and operates them so long as a market exists.<br><br>The myth: Capitalism was responsible for the rapid development of Asia<br>The truth: Post World War Two the USA was 50% of all economic activity in the entire fucking world. South Korea and Japan exploded because they out of all of Asia were able to secure special trade deals with the US as part of their post-war recovery packages. Like the Germans, the Asian economic boom was propped up by massive foreign investment that no other countries had access to.

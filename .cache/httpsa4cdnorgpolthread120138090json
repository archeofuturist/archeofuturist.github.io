In China capital is owned privately but controlled by the state through a shadow government and draconian regulation. In the USSR capital was owned by the state but controlled privately. Free markets are a consideration because capitalism by definition requires a free market, but although capitalism requires free markets, free markets do not require capitalism. Market socialism, or Strasserism, or a billion other ideas, are all ideologies that change the industrial relations inside firms and not the rivalrous relations between firms.

South Korea and Japan exploded because they out of all of Asia were able to secure special trade deals with the US as part of their post-war recovery packages. Like the Germans, the Asian economic boom was propped up by massive foreign investment that no other countries had access to.

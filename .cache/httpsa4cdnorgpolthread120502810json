Its sole mission: dismantling public-sphere affirmative action-style programs Blum says perpetuate inequality and restrict fair opportunities for minorities.&#039;<br><br>Again, &quot;These discriminatory policies in college admissions are expressly forbidden by the Fourteenth Amendment and federal civil rights laws.&quot;<br><br>Asians being the smallest minority group while being discriminated at the largest rate in college admissions can help us dismantle Affirmative-Action. Asians need to make the same argument that they are not looking for the same outcome, but just the same opportunity as black students. If a 3.5 GPA 25 MCAT black student is accepted at a 50% rate, then Asians should have those exact same opportunities as blacks. Asians, it is to bombard every college with lawsuits.","filename":"image","ext":".jpg","w":768,"h":794,"tn_w":241,"tn_h":249,"tim":1491863347251,"time":1491863347,"md5":"JsWOikJbKHAtjMBQuZDhyg==","fsize":132354,"resto":0,"id":"kuoIWbzS","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"asians-help-us-dismantle-affirmativeaction","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

This Lupin guy made a comment on wrestler guy&#039;s picture that he posted of a few wrestlers from the early 00&#039;s, and one of them was looking real faggy. The Lupin guy said the faggy looking guy was looking real &quot;homo&quot; jokingly and then goes on to say he loves that particular wrestler. Wrestling guy responds back with pic related and then it goes on from there. I&#039;m seeing nothing but people bitching about how wrong that is despite it being the truth. The wrestler was looking pretty fruity and the lupin guy clearly didn&#039;t mean anything by it.<br><br>Has political correctness gone too far? It&#039;s gotten to the point where people feel the need to whine about everything including something so minuscule. I have never seen such pettiness until now.","filename":"image","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":918,"tn_w":174,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491415106416,"time":1491415106,"md5":"pdrLRWYXNIOZFPHglNdzQw==","fsize":117574,"resto":0,"id":"gQ+fVwfl","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"so-im-going-through-my-twiiter-feed-and-i-noticed","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

TYTNetwork.com for instance at like #14,000. Yet, he is losing subscribers on YouTube and barely shows up when you search him on Google and TYT is growing for example on YouTube.<br><br>His Live stream shows have like 4k viewers when they air, TYT has like 12k. Meanwhile, not even TYT&#039;s audience like TYT and it&#039;s all a bunch of dislikes and bad comments and Alex Jones&#039;s viewers love his show.<br><br>Every major up and coming YouTube channel that has the same target audience are all growing at a rapid pace, but only InfoWars is in fact shrinking. JRE is growing unprecedented. TYT is growing (these guys are being promoted AF by YouTube), Dave Rubin is growing, Louder with Crowder is growing, but Alex Jones is fucking shrinking.<br><br>That is just YouTube. Alexa ranks don&#039;t lie. Alex Jones would probably have insane YouTube traffic and Google hits and an even higher Alexa rating if Google wasn&#039;t so actively trying to shut him down.<br><br>On top of that they also cut him off of AdSense which is a major disgrace.<br><br>It is insane. If they can successfully do it to him, they will be able to do it to anybody.","filename":"alexjones","ext":".jpg","w":1037,"h":583,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1493166891851,"time":1493166891,"md5":"vurmxnYhIJkJrc1\/l6JRPA==","fsize":234442,"resto":0,"id":"++bkXFZe","country":"SE","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"he-is-fighting-for-his-life-right-now","country_name":"Sweden","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

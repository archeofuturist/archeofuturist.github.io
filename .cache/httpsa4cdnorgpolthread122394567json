I could see value in abstract (modern) art in that sense. The examples seen in the OP&#039;s post do not reveal something higher, I can&#039;t even tell if they are making fun of the modern state of art or if they are serious. What they &quot;reveal&quot; is meant to &quot;make you think&quot; and &quot;shock the bourgeoisie&quot;, but only to come to a predigested and politicized conclusion of shoehorned in by the artist. They think themselves rebels revolting against some imaginary establishment, but they are not, the whole establishment it as leftist as they are and their art merely propaganda.<br><br>Art should not only reveal the ideal but also bring beauty into this world.

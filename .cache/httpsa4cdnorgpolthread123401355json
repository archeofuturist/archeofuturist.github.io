Fuck you. I&#039;ve had it. I&#039;ve tried to play nice. I&#039;ve tried to laugh it off. But enough is enough. The Canada-hate thing is getting old. I know we have a reputation for being kind and polite, but that ends now.<br><br>The Canada-hate has to stop. First of all, it&#039;s based off a lie - that we&#039;re cucked because our Prime Minister is a \u201ccuck\u201d, as you call it. That isn&#039;t even true. Justin Trudeau is a former boxer, snowboarder, and environmentalist. Name me one &quot;real&quot; man who can claim even two of those things! Secondly, Canadians aren&#039;t shitposters. We speak our feelings. We tell you the truth. We share our opinions. If that&#039;s what counts as shitposting these days, then call me an Aussie. I don&#039;t know why Americans are so intimidated by hearing genuine, thoughtful criticism of their country and their politics, but you obviously are. All I can say to that is: deal with it. It&#039;s the 21st century. This is the information age. If information scares you, then go back to your bumfuck trailer somewhere and hang on to your delusions. So what if we welcome refugees and are legalizing weed? Me? I&#039;m a freethinker. I&#039;m an idea man. I thrive off of enthusiasm. And I fucking love science. So when a Canadian is nice enough to offer you constructive criticism, take it as a compliment. Because we want to see you thrive as a country. We want to see you progress and follow us into the future.<br><br>End Canada-hate NOW.","filename":"canflag","ext":".jpg","w":300,"h":168,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1493511034050,"time":1493511034,"md5":"i44tqwWZBy7AHORNrPBqyA==","fsize":13970,"resto":123401355,"id":"SN55ojRM","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123405351,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)20:12:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123401355\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123401355<\/a><br>kek","filename":"drug_routes_2010_8001","ext":".jpg","w":800,"h":570,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":89,"tim":1493511150959,"time":1493511150,"md5":"RzJlTZT0PlcOfZ\/xvFvXLA==","fsize":209709,"resto":123401355,"id":"4EBFeZQl","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123406828,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)20:22:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123401355\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123401355<\/a><br>What TV show can&#039;t be talked about?","time":1493511736,"resto":123401355,"id":"06NsY6wm","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123407302,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)20:25:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123401355\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123401355<\/a><br><br>Western Canada is still sane and pure.

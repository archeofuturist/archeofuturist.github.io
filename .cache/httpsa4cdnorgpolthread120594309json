When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying.<br>The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like \u201cSir, you need to pay for those first.\u201d At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.<br>When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually \u201cto prevent any electrical infetterence,\u201d and then turned around and winked at me. I don\u2019t even think that\u2019s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly.","time":1491922827,"resto":120594309,"id":"ZXSUVbER","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120607598,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)11:03:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"THE LIBURAL MANE STREEM MECHYOR, SEE ENEN, FAWX, UND UNBEESEE BOCKING TROMP, NEYOKUN OBUMAH TOO POINT OWE","filename":"bbc for pjw","ext":".png","w":800,"h":597,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1491923023883,"time":1491923023,"md5":"knsHr\/uzQVja6SST4AQZUg==","fsize":285076,"resto":120594309,"id":"e+qSLKpy","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120607627,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)11:03:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120607231\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120607231<\/a><br>Haaaaw nooooo staaaaaaaahhhhpppp you&#039;re just too funnnnnneeeeehhhh ooooooh muh siiiiiiiiides nooooo staaaahppp hahahaha so funneeeeeeh oh wow now I know why I come to \/pol\/ such funnnnnneeeeehhhhh oh staaaaahhhppp!","time":1491923038,"resto":120594309,"id":"VepJCMbr","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":120607630,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)11:04:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120607228\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120607228<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;15 posts by this ID<\/span>","filename":"20170411_110227","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":768,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1491923040149,"time":1491923040,"md5":"7a4QnUxd+zN1Zg7TQpZQXA==","fsize":275069,"resto":120594309,"id":"xpX6cxfE","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120607677,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)11:04:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120607228\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120607228<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;15 posts by this ID<\/span>","filename":"1476624965924","ext":".jpg","w":300,"h":295,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":122,"tim":1491923064337,"time":1491923064,"md5":"lGo54LN6d4C7NnwBY3LY\/A==","fsize":14745,"resto":120594309,"id":"GzLs6xd6","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120607761,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)11:05:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120594309\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120594309<\/a><br>WELL IMAGINE MY SHOCK","filename":"medier","ext":".png","w":1600,"h":900,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1491923106927,"time":1491923106,"md5":"cH+m6KPP8QC0qA1NB3Q35g==","fsize":1516976,"resto":120594309,"id":"UoD+WBkQ","country":"GR","m_img":1,"country_name":"Greece"},{"no":120607848,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)11:05:56","name":"Anonymous","filename":"MSM","ext":".png","w":800,"h":597,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1491923156000,"time":1491923156,"md5":"8bkJuCaaOb51Yd2gB\/m8jg==","fsize":297998,"resto":120594309,"id":"e+qSLKpy","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120607849,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)11:05:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;16\/105 posts from the same &quot;Frenchman&quot;<\/span>","time":1491923156,"resto":120594309,"id":"4rU7EAcl","country":"HR","country_name":"Croatia"},{"no":120608033,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)11:07:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120607849\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120607849<\/a><br>(((Frenchman)))","filename":"jew_basic","ext":".jpg","w":220,"h":220,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491923261404,"time":1491923261,"md5":"lQj+uKhhZS6j+lzrGVUJ\/A==","fsize":19421,"resto":120594309,"id":"xpX6cxfE","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120608187,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)11:08:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120607630\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120607630<\/a><br><a href=\"#p120607677\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120607677<\/a><br>HAHAHAHAHAH LOL SO FUUUUUNEEEEEHHHH how do you The_Donald morons stay so FUUUUUUUNNNNEHHHHE and still manage to keep licking the shit out of the ass of a globalist traitor like Trump?","time":1491923332,"resto":120594309,"id":"VepJCMbr","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":120608335,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)11:10:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120608187\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120608187<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;17 posts by this ID<\/span>","filename":"1491780405999","ext":".jpg","w":400,"h":400,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491923410705,"time":1491923410,"md5":"sYQ\/JxdreZ5Yp6F2YZhUJw==","fsize":21010,"resto":120594309,"id":"GzLs6xd6","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120608336,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)11:10:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120594309\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120594309<\/a><br>he criticized trumps bombing of syria, therefore he seems to be somewhat honest","time":1491923411,"resto":120594309,"id":"9r5dBtVP","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":120608660,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)11:13:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120608033\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120608033<\/a><br>By the way, observe this closely, those of you browsing this thread who are NOT from Reddit.<br><br>I may have made 16 posts.

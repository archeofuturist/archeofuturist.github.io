There was zero scientific evidence presented to back anything which was being stated, and as a result of this every statement was an unfounded assertion.<br><br>The funny thing is the best episode of the series was the one which followed this mess, even if it was basically an advertisement for various private space organizations. One third of the episode consisted of a conversation between Bill and a panel with the CEO of Virgin Galactic (space tourism), the president and founder of Planetary Resources (asteroid mining), and an assistant director of NASA&#039;s Goddard Space Flight Center. This panel was easily the most qualified and interesting in comparison to the other panels which often had to use comedians and other random people as filler and had no actual talking points.","time":1493179295,"resto":122832802,"id":"bMZFA\/9D","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122839762,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)00:01:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122839433\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122839433<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Bernie Sanders is a hologram that has an orgasm<\/span><br><br>I&#039;m dying","time":1493179304,"resto":122832802,"id":"3qpX\/GTj","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122839993,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)00:04:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"Let&#039;s convince this faggot he&#039;s a chick","filename":"image","ext":".gif","w":450,"h":480,"tn_w":117,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493179443594,"time":1493179443,"md5":"40vjB4t0OHevgkStLSz4sQ==","fsize":110352,"resto":122832802,"id":"I7Yi5TYj","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122840010,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)00:04:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"I wanna bring up the &quot;gender&quot; problem, how some people believe gender is on an infinite spectrum and how others believe it&#039;s simply binary.

He was sitting alone and it looked like he&#039;d only just started eating, so I decided to just go up and say hi (if his friends were there I would have just let him be). Anyway, I walk up and say hello and tell him I&#039;m a huge fan... Nothing. No reaction. Doesn&#039;t say a word. He just sits there, staring right through me. Staring intensely, but with no emotion whatsoever. I begin to feel awkward, so I say &quot;sorry to disturb you&quot; and start to walk away but before I even get a chance to turn he just gets up suddenly and starts walking toward me, still making full eye contact. At first I thought he was going to try and barge into me or something, but at the last minute (like an inch away from me) he turns and heads toward the trash can. Then he starts dumping everything on his plate into it. One by one. Steak, broccoli, everything. He picks up each bit of food up, holds it high above the can and drops it. Some of it (the steak) didn&#039;t even make it into the trash because he wasn&#039;t looking at what she was doing. Finally his plate is empty and this is the part that really fucking weirded me out. He looks around to check no one (but me) is looking, then slides the plate under his jacket and walks out.

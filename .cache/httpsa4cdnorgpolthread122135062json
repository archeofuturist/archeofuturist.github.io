She was 33 and SMOKIN&#039; (like REALLY SMOKIN&#039;) hot. I went to a big liberal arts school in a smaller city, that had a shit ton of artsy types. Lots of chicks with tattoos, and this smokin&#039; hot bartender friend, was literally tatted from her chest to her feet... Full sleeves on both arms, while back, top of thighs, etc. She looked so good even with all those tattoos, you might have gotten the great idea to get one too, thinking it&#039;d look as good on you as it did her... But no. <br><br>Well, I just saw on FB like a weeks ago that she is now, at 44 y\/o, having a mental fucking breakdown about all of her tattoos. She wishes she had the money to get them all removed, hates waking up and looking at them every morning, takes exhaustive efforts to cover them up and basically says she has to dress like a Muslim to go to work in her corporate job every day, even in the summer when she&#039;s sweating her ass off. I know, I know, she&#039;s a stupid cunt for getting them all in the first place. She probably spent $30-30k for it all, too. Buuuut, it&#039;s still really sad to see, cause she wasn&#039;t just hot (and she&#039;s still really hot), she was also one of the most genuinely nice people, I&#039;ve ever met. <br><br>The thing about tattoos like this on chicks is that we can only play them off for so long. Eventually, you&#039;re not as &quot;hot&quot;, after kids, your body looks like an amoeba for fucks sake. You just wanna throw on your JCrew shorts w\/ a ponytail like every other mom and head to your kids PTA meeting without being stared at, like you&#039;re a fucking side show. I have lots of other friends who hate their tattoos now too and they&#039;re not even 1\/4th as bad as this other chick. They just wanna get a tramp stamp removed. <br><br>The other ig thing is those gages.

If I understand it correctly it implies that the blacks never had any kings or kingdoms at all but that is completely false as they had Nubia, Songhai, Kush Kingdom, Egypt (depending on your definition of black) and these are just the ones I&#039;m naming off the top of my head. What makes even less sense is that these very same people who shout WE WUZ then turn around and claim &quot;Aryan Master Race&quot; when there has never been a single notable civilization \/ kingdom in Scandinavia at all and the whole area never developed past small tribes in mud huts until way after the rest of Europe when they could copy their technology.","filename":"social_songhai[1]","ext":".png","w":500,"h":257,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":128,"tim":1493481136238,"time":1493481136,"md5":"Ys2ve8i58LVGGYTHY9zaPA==","fsize":312645,"resto":0,"id":"NYkDecpq","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"they-were-kings-tho","country_name":"United States","replies":6,"images":1,"unique_ips":5},{"no":123346466,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)11:59:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123345773\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123345773<\/a><br>The western ideal for kingship is the Roman imperium.<br><br> Not a collection of mud and stick huts held together by the fear of horse riding rapist bands.<br><br>Now fuck off.","time":1493481551,"resto":123345773,"id":"M4SZy9jB","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123346919,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)12:03:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123346466\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123346466<\/a><br>You are pretty historically illiterate m8...","filename":"jenne-mosque[1]","ext":".jpg","w":550,"h":300,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":68,"tim":1493481831770,"time":1493481831,"md5":"O+0eJoLnPGITJ8KvIUfZpQ==","fsize":64073,"resto":123345773,"id":"NYkDecpq","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123347133,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)12:06:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123345773\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123345773<\/a><br>you do not seem to understand it correctly.<br><br>the meme dos not imply that there were no black kings or kingdoms, it suggests that most, if not all, black people are direct decendants of and are you herefore, in fact, KANGZ!!<br><br>to clarify, think chimplamagne<br><br>and on a final note, stop being a faggot","time":1493481964,"resto":123345773,"id":"g9dHI9FD","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123347660,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)12:11:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123346919\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123346919<\/a><br>Literally working on my history masters right now, m8.<br><br><a href=\"#p123347133\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123347133<\/a><br>^^^","time":1493482267,"resto":123345773,"id":"M4SZy9jB","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123347859,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)12:13:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123346919\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123346919<\/a><br>wow a giant mudhut dedicated to worshipping a pedophile schizophrenic who said he crashed space donkeys into the moon<br><br>incredible accomplishment by the Melanin KANGZ how can white bois compete?","time":1493482381,"resto":123345773,"id":"jiI1zJIH","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123348085,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)12:15:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123346466\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123346466<\/a><br>Are vikings an acception?

You start with nothing on the map and you gradually build up your army and fame. Battles take place on the field with you in third person, kind of like Total War but you are participating. Army size is scaled down to about 50-200 men total depending on your difficulty settings. You can give them commands too ofc. Few hours in and you should have a 50 strong army made up of...whatever you want really.<br><br>You can be a horse archer, knight, a two handed killing machine, whatever you want. You can recruit companions and customize them and later, once you are strong enough to found your own kingdom, you can vassalize them so they have their own armies.<br><br>You can swear loyalty to a king and recieve fiefs. You can lay siege to castles or cities either alone or with other lords. You can rob caravans, raid villages, or travel from city to city buying low and selling high.<br><br>Its very moddable too. Theres a WW1 mod, medieval japan mod, star wars mod, napoleon dlc and dozens of others...It will occupy you for at least hundreds of hours just on single player.","filename":"20170310223919_1","ext":".jpg","w":1680,"h":1050,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":78,"tim":1490957528440,"time":1490957528,"md5":"V3GRa81fMGugitKJpK0LKQ==","fsize":561038,"resto":119036172,"id":"bjUH2jxn","country":"HU","m_img":1,"country_name":"Hungary"},{"no":119045433,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)06:53:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a

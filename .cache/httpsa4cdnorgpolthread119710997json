Democrats do not want Republicans being allowed to auto-vote a nominee in.<br><br>By the way, this goes beyond Supreme Court nominees. If Democrats prove they are unwilling to cooperate with Gorgonzola (I can&#039;t spell his name fuck it), somebody they admit is qualified and a worthy pick, then Republicans see that as a sign that Democrats will never vote in favor of anything Trump related. That means Republicans will just flat out ignore the other parties and go straight to passing laws through any loopholes necessary. This means no compromises.<br><br>Democrats are fucking stupid if they filibuster this nomination. Nearly everybody agrees to just suck it up and let Trump have his nominee pass.","time":1491457494,"resto":119710997,"id":"1WVhbf5L","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119711498,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)01:45:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119711256\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119711256<\/a><br>I hope they are not serious","time":1491457521,"resto":119710997,"id":"qCh2WXIS","country":"HR","country_name":"Croatia"},{"no":119711501,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)01:45:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119711369\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119711369<\/a><br><a href=\"#p119711223\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119711223<\/a>","time":1491457522,"resto":119710997,"id":"VHmUwy+u","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":119711502,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)01:45:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119711247\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119711247<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Makes me sick.<\/span><br><br>Unironically taking a job where your employers openly call you a nerd virgin pretty clearly establishes that you were already sick.","filename":"1491378748637","ext":".png","w":900,"h":900,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491457525312,"time":1491457525,"md5":"xN7818+xg9KwC4ZQzV0PpA==","fsize":336395,"resto":119710997,"id":"J\/TS96+Q","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119711511,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)01:45:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119711427\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119711427<\/a><br>okay","filename":"Brap","ext":".png","w":97,"h":57,"tn_w":97,"tn_h":57,"tim":1491457531820,"time":1491457531,"md5":"e4eq+ZBbqGdvQI4Fluasjw==","fsize":680,"resto":119710997,"id":"Sk8O6RjY","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119711531,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)01:45:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119711354\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119711354<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;tfw no continental army gf<\/span>","filename":"1484924601464","ext":".png","w":1280,"h":720,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1491457548189,"time":1491457548,"md5":"5JsV+94OT0DAeQpjHBxQNg==","fsize":1147993,"resto":119710997,"id":"kC4UIw9e","country":"AU","m_img":1,"country_name":"Australia"},{"no":119711532,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)01:45:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119711286\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119711286<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Shills cheering that Bannon is off NSC<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;He went to an NSC meeting today<\/span>","filename":"1485933999468","ext":".gif","w":480,"h":270,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1491457551932,"time":1491457551,"md5":"TkeJV+d2jnI\/ywuiO1wuaw==","fsize":1958870,"resto":119710997,"id":"XXbvgcJt","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119711536,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)01:45:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"Trump is high on the Kush.","filename":"58084295","ext":".jpg","w":745,"h":422,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1491457553232,"time":1491457553,"md5":"JxiNrr8K9M2YFVPw3pbHHA==","fsize":50024,"resto":119710997,"id":"E38QYpPc","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119711571,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)01:46:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119711341\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119711341<\/a><br>Republicans are retarded, but Democrats unironically want us dead.

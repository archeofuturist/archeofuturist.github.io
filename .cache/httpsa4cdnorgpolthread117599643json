It should come as no surprise that they predicted the future when all they did was: everything in their power to make it happen, no matter how abominable, even if it included &quot;slaying the son of man&quot; presumably by stabbing him in the back. And the other failures were laughable, prophecies that didn&#039;t come true that won&#039;t come true because Judah failed to realised their self fabricated claim of divine right wouldn&#039;t stand the test of time no matter how hard they tried to legitimise themselves. <br><br>The New Testament is a bloody curse, if Jesus was the Christ entirely and eternally then why did he ask why his &quot;father had forsaken&quot; him? The drama of the New Testament was apparent. It&#039;s yet another drama of a bunch of Juden (genetically) corrupted by Lucifer and Babylon trying to deceive, exploit and pacify the uncorrupted &quot;goyim&quot; and dispersed Israelites in order to claim divine right.<br><br>It&#039;s no wonder the world is so mad when a bunch of faggots thought they could cocksuck their way into world domination, the tools.","filename":"Bicycle Ace","ext":".jpg","w":749,"h":1066,"tn_w":175,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490079838437,"time":1490079838,"md5":"0qS5J+QohpjSXOcpdAMh8Q==","fsize":162570,"resto":0,"id":"WoJh2Knv","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"christianity","country_name":"United States","replies":7,"images":1,"unique_ips":1},{"no":117600274,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)03:12:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"Here&#039;s another red pill.<br><br>Why would people put so much effort and input such meticulous specifics into the design and construction of the great pyramids of Giza when science suppose it performed no function?<br><br>The obvious answer is that they wouldn&#039;t.","filename":"joker","ext":".jpg","w":95,"h":124,"tn_w":95,"tn_h":124,"tim":1490080370687,"time":1490080370,"md5":"z8tSwg1Qy3cmlqSVe3tUQw==","fsize":3143,"resto":117599643,"id":"WoJh2Knv","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117600557,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)03:17:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"And another red pill. <br><br>Why do I rarely ever see cool threads made by real people on 4chan? <br><br>The obvious answer is the mods screen new posts and threads extensively.","time":1490080628,"resto":117599643,"id":"WoJh2Knv","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117601194,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)03:26:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"What is this, the media?","time":1490081214,"resto":117599643,"id":"WoJh2Knv","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117601380,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)03:30:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"Is everyone choking on these red pills?

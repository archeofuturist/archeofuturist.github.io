He continually tries to demean, to humiliate, to force unfunny memes about Peterson, because the puppeteers pulling his strings have done just enough research to get a vague idea that shitposting and memes is how discourse is shaped on \/pol\/.<br><br>Yet his memeing always fails, his posts reek of shillery. He cannot possibly emulate the shitposting and memery of a genuine \/pol\/lack, because he lacks something that every \/pol\/-goer has. Humanity, and a free mind. The brotherly pissing contests and trading of jests that makes the bond between anons tighter is predicated on truth. The very same truth that Peterson so passionately promotes. <br><br>And the \/pol\/lack&#039;s memes and shitposting catch on because it fills the posters with the satisfaction of speaking the truth. As Peterson says, one can tell, one can feel, when they are being false. And one can feel the satisfaction of boldly stating the truth. <br><br>\/pol\/ is a board of truth-speakers, and as such is immune to such blatant shillery and lies. New thinktanks, new social media campaigns, new efforts to subvert us pop up continuously, and they always fail. <br><br>The reason is quite simple: the truth is on our side. And while the leaf shilling against Peterson collects his paltry salary for attempting to chop down a great tree with a toothpick, \/pol\/ grows ever further, reaching higher and higher into the light. As he turns in for the night, his body filled with the shame and discomfort of having an occupation devoted to conscious lying, \/pol\/ continues on stronger than ever before. His enemies grow even stronger as his body shudders from the guilt. Such is the way of shadows, to shrink before the sun.","filename":"9277c5a0b22101041e014717a640af7b","ext":".jpg","w":1200,"h":800,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1491347373404,"time":1491347373,"md5":"Y8czg+13pvJPRtXSiGOFKw==","fsize":682217,"resto":119526342,"id":"8GQBu2ej","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":119531536,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)19:10:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119526342\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119526342<\/a><br>Is this fake news?","time":1491347438,"resto":119526342,"id":"iBpAZyjN","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119531566,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)19:10:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119530316\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119530316<\/a><br>I&#039;m sad for you.

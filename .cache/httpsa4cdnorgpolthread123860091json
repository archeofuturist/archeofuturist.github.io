The issue is that costs for treatment for anything over pills is ridiculously over-inflated due to insurance. It&#039;s the same issue as education here, if a business knows someone else will subsidize it in the majority of cases they will increase costs to get as much as they can.<br><br>That said, Kimmel is a highly famous and I&#039;m sure highly paid entertainer who has no problem paying for his child&#039;s treatment. This comes off as disingenuine because anyone with an idea of his role in media should know he is paid extravagantly. The underlying problem is that insurance caused a massive increase in the cost of healthcare in the US, not that people didn&#039;t have insurance in the first place.","time":1493779968,"resto":123860091,"id":"LyxE3X6N","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123861094,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)22:54:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123860091\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123860091<\/a><br>Everyone in America has access to healthcare you fucking retards, hospitals don&#039;t turn you away for not having insurance.

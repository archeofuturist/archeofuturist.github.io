He won only 43% of the white vote in his first election. Honestly, if these people wanted to use a black politician as an example, Tim Scott (R) of South Carolina is probably a better example. Tim Scott has never run against a white candidate. But he has at least gotten a lot of white southerners to vote for him.<br><br>2) White voters know that black people represent only 13% of the population and are no threat to white supremacy in a democracy. In some of the areas that had a lot of white voters going for Obama, like Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Indiana, Ohio, and so on-- black people are an even smaller share of the population, sometimes hardly even visible. White voters in these areas know that ultimately, they hold the power of the ballot box, and what they give to a man like Obama they can take away just as easily. Can we really say that voting for Obama was a vote against systemic racism when white voters who voted for them were not risking their racial privilege?<br><br>3) Assuaging white guilt was a mental point that some white voters convinced themselves Obama&#039;s election would serve. There was the idea &quot;If I vote for him it proves I&#039;m not a racist.&quot; Then, when they go and do something racist (like vote for Trump) they can use their vote for Obama as a defense. &quot;I can&#039;t be racist because I voted Obama!&quot; But does supporting a minority candidate once really mean you can&#039;t be racist forevermore?","filename":"b4f","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":451,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1490865465870,"time":1490865465,"md5":"BjiXmb+rZYULm7ky1yH9TQ==","fsize":24669,"resto":0,"id":"hqDnh2Zu","country":"EE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"when-discussing-the-election-sometimes-someone","country_name":"Estonia","replies":6,"images":1,"unique_ips":6},{"no":118904791,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)05:18:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118904764\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118904764<\/a><br><br>Trump-Clinton brought out new fissures of gender and immigration.<br><br>For gender--women represent 51% of the population and voting population. Minority women already vote Democratic, but if white women--who are 35% of the electorate-- started voting on the basis of gender identity with the minority party, what recourse would white supremacy have left? To rebuild the majority they would have to either reach out to minorities--e.g. abandon white supremacy. Isn&#039;t this a good explanation for why Hillary, as a white woman, was seen as more threatening than Obama, a black man? Her form of identity politics threatened to reconfigure coalitions to actually undermine white patriarchy.<br><br>Secondly, is immigration-- unlike civil rights, immigration changes the numbers of the US population, to the point where minorities can become a larger voting bloc. I believe this explains why the AltRight focuses more on immigration, even though most immigrants are peaceful and hardworking. Someone like Daniela Vargas is more threatening to white supremacy than a violent criminal, or even a terrorist, precisely because she represents legitimate change away from white domination of the electorate.<br><br>Hence since gender politics and immigration are more threatening than a token black man being elected president, was Hillary Clinton&#039;s campaign, which embraced both, more threatening to white supremacy than Obama&#039;s? If so, does the fact that her campaign was rejected prove that the electorate is racist?","time":1490865505,"resto":118904764,"id":"hqDnh2Zu","country":"EE","country_name":"Estonia"},{"no":118905118,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)05:24:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118904764\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118904764<\/a><br>They elected a mulatto twice. <br><br>Seems pretty open to me.","time":1490865873,"resto":118904764,"id":"ww+HVwsz","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118905170,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)05:25:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"Excellent example of neomarxist postmodern pseudophilosophical psychobabble.","time":1490865929,"resto":118904764,"id":"tM9an6WF","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118905223,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)05:26:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"Sage for OP pic","time":1490865990,"resto":118904764,"id":"tME2g3lm","country":"AT","country_name":"Austria"},{"no":118905369,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)05:29:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118904764\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118904764<\/a><br>So you made a whole Thread just to bring out one single argument we had here 1000 times?<br><br>If you consider that black people voted with incredible 95% Obama, doesn&#039;t that mean, that your theory, that you can read racism out of voting data, says that black people are the most racist people?<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;White voters know that black people represent only 13% of the population and are no threat to white supremacy.<\/span><br>If those 13% vote with 95% for their candidate, just because he is black, then they are a threat.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;they can use their vote for Obama as a defense<\/span><br>This is just plain stupid<br><br>Is this your first time on \/pol\/?

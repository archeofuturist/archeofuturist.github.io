There exists no logically valid answer to this question that doesn&#039;t require you to admit one of the following about Yahweh: <br>A- Omnipotence is self defeating and therefore impossible<br>B- Objective morality and truth is a lie and impossible. <br><br>This is why every sane person is at least 25% agnostic. Religious doctrine taken literally always results in constructed beliefs that can be dissected down to an ad-absurdum status by even the most basic of philosophical questions.<br><br>Anyone who bases their core political beliefs purely on religion is an idiot. Someone who seriously votes and maintains a worldview that hinges on the presupposed truth of an unverifiable doctrine is a cancerous shitstain on humanity and their opinions on anything and everything are without merit.","filename":"845562251532","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":853,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1492550731809,"time":1492550731,"md5":"8cfIxt58XZOfUBJO21iQcQ==","fsize":242807,"resto":0,"id":"MVA8hI3A","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"can-an-omnipotetant-and-omnibenevolent-god-create","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

Grocery stores fight over literally 2% profit margins. With the kind of edge you could get hiring women, you could murder the competition.<br><br>Oh wait though, because women spend their time raising kids, and won&#039;t work in the coal mines where they risk losing their arm, we need to give single women gibs and force more women through university despite them not going into jobs after unlike the men. Not because it&#039;s causing more people to actually become employed, but until there is a 50\/50 wage gap, we need to throw our money at inefficiently forcing women through careers they&#039;re too incapable to succeed at without societies help. Which they then quit to raise their kids.<br><br>Women being unable to negotiate higher salaries is patriarchy, clearly what this means isn&#039;t that women should unionize, but that we need more gibs, and unions are bad.<br><br>Careers filled with women having the women all get paid less, and careers with men result in the men all getting paid more, isn&#039;t a sign that women suck and if men let women into their workplace they will GET PAID LESS BY PROXY, no, it means men need to invite MORE women into the workplace! In fact, it&#039;s a lack of female representation that holds workplaces back. I would point out that you don&#039;t want to invite women into the places you work, because it will mean you get paid less, for the sake of kek, it will piss them off SO much because they can&#039;t deny it.<br><br>If only women somehow, had complete control over the child birthing process, and the upper hand in custody battles, and could leverage those advantages to force men to do things. <br>Marriage is patriarchy though. <br><br>Gender equality was a mistake.

But it would be an even bigger defeat for Paul Ryan, who has all but staked his Speakership on passing this bill. And in the hall of mirrors that is Washington, the big winner to emerge out of the health-care debacle could be Steve Bannon. That\u2019s because Bannon has been waging war against Ryan for years. For Bannon, Ryan is the embodiment of the \u201cglobalist-corporatist\u201d Republican elite. A failed bill would be Bannon\u2019s best chance yet to topple Ryan and advance his nationalist-populist economic agenda.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Publicly, Bannon has been working to help the bill pass. But privately he\u2019s talked it down in recent days. According to a source close to the White House, Bannon said that he\u2019s unhappy with the Ryan bill because it \u201cdoesn\u2019t drive down costs\u201d and was \u201cwritten by the insurance industry.\u201d While the bill strips away many of Obamacare\u2019s provisions, it does not go as far as Bannon would wish to \u201cdeconstruct the administrative state\u201d in the realm of health care. Furthermore, Bannon has been distancing himself from the bill to insulate himself from political fallout of it failing. He\u2019s told people that Trump economic adviser Gary Cohn \u2014 a West Wing rival \u2014 has run point on it.

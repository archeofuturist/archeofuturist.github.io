It&#039;s referred to as the &quot;War of Northern Aggression&quot;. They&#039;re not just taught that southern men fought bravely for their homeland. They&#039;re taught that their cause was just. They have monuments to mass murderers in their town squares. Imagine if Einsatzgruppe soldiers were memorialized in modern Germany. Fuck the south. Fuck confederate flags. Yes the civil war was entirely about slavery.","time":1490184896,"resto":117747430,"id":"8xPZgECF","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":117752450,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)08:17:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117752281\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117752281<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;all so they could continue raping black girls and drinking sweet tea on their front porch<\/span><br><br>thats a pretty good reason tbhfam","time":1490185051,"resto":117747430,"id":"W8LjMmeL","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117752601,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)08:19:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117750568\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117750568<\/a><br>Expecting people to watch a 45 minute video are you nuts?! <br><br>...I&#039;ll probably watch it I&#039;m not busy","time":1490185192,"resto":117747430,"id":"8xPZgECF","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":117752763,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)08:22:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117751093\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117751093<\/a><br>Have some more.<br><br><a href=\"#p117752281\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117752281<\/a><br>You guys should build a statue for Rommel.","filename":"1489551091523","ext":".jpg","w":2048,"h":1271,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":77,"tim":1490185322567,"time":1490185322,"md5":"IFIOowGIOu3F8znFqNu1Tg==","fsize":574529,"resto":117747430,"id":"0mgHATEH","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":117752994,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)08:24:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117752763\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117752763<\/a><br>Rommel wasnt that great, hince the reason hitler sent him to the boonies, the allies just considered him an honorable foe","time":1490185496,"resto":117747430,"id":"bYnVUwOT","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117753049,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)08:25:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117747786\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117747786<\/a><br>We did use mass immigration.

Before that, free states and slave states were an equal number, thus both got equal saying. However, after the new territories were acquired, the south wanted them to be slave states because they wanted move west. North refused because it would have made the south too powerful. Things got really heated and in the 1860 elections, the democrats threw a hissy fit about Lincoln saying he will free the slaves. When he won they did the whole he is not my president, and south Carolina left the union. Lincoln tried to calm the south by sending a treaty promising them that they can keep slavery permanently if they want. However, they can&#039;t extend slavery to the newly acquired territories. The south responded by attacking a fort (fort Sumter) like cowards. The officer in charge said he took joy in being one of the few that tore old glory (the US flag). That pissed off the north and war was declared. The south, once realized its getting its ass kicked, tried to get help from Europe (mostly England), so Lincoln made the war about slavery.","time":1490185636,"resto":117747430,"id":"PGMna2FD","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117753239,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)08:28:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117747430\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117747430<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Enslaving sub-humans<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Wrong<\/span><br>I seriously do not see the issue with enslaving niggers.","time":1490185710,"resto":117747430,"id":"TLHaMdEV","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"},{"no":117753320,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)08:29:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117748109\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117748109<\/a><br>Yes and Brazil had taken way more slaves than the US ever did.

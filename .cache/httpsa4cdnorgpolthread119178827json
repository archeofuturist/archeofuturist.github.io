Take WW2 for example. The U.S. had absolutely no interest in entering the war. J.P. Morgan and David Rockefeller however had massive loans made in Britain and in China. If Britain were to lose the war, J.P. Morgan&#039;s bank would experience a bank run and the U.S. economy would have tanked. Rockefeller was heavily investing in China and if Japan were to win the war against China his bank would have experienced a bank run too. <br><br>So these powerful bankers go to FDR and persuade him to support both Britain and China. It starts with the lend-lease program which was when Americans literally paid for war supplies for nations fighting the Axis powers. Next FDR signs documents saying if Axis warships get too close to American merchant ships it will be cause for war. So then FDR smuggles weapons in merchant ships as well as has some smuggler merchant ships sail toward German warships to force them to move or cause war with the U.S. Eventually after losing dozens of warships and even civilian ships the Germans get pissed and decide war with the U.S. is a good idea. In Japan FDR signed the oil embargo leaving Japan with literally 3 months of oil and no oil fields so Japan had to go to war to find oil.<br><br>It&#039;s never about specifically Jewish interests it is about the interests of the fractional reserve banking elite (though most of these elite are Jews). These banking elite controls Central Banks throughout the world.

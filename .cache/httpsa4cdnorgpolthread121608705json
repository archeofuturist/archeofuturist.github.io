I have a major dilemma here. I think I&#039;ll stay with her for a little longer, see how she reacts after communication about these things, and then after this whole situation has died down I think I might move and do exactly what you outlined in your greentext, because I need to find a woman who will allow me to do this stuff to her","time":1492485238,"resto":121608705,"id":"41VJQBFX","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121629365,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)23:14:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121628913\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121628913<\/a><br>To me, there is no reasons other than arbitrary ones to believe in any particular religion&#039;s veracity other the thousands of other religions that exist and have existed.

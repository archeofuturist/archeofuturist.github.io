Most SAM systems are of Soviet design lineage with some locally produced designs, while AA artillery is from both Soviet and local suppliers. MANPADS are used extensively, with over 15,000 units fielded according to a 1995 Pentagon report on the country. North Korea has one of the most extensive integrated air defence systems (IADS) in the world, with many of its radars and launchers positioned on fortified elevating platforms, its aircraft positioned in hardened bunkers and even two underground airbases, and some level of coverage for every town.[28] The addition of the KN-06 SAM, which was flight-tested in the spring of 2011, and a local model of the Pechora 2 (Upgraded SA-3), unveiled at a 2012 military parade have notably expanded the systems capabilities. According IHS Jane&#039;s Defence Weekly currently has on 2014 two different more updated system: the KN-06\/Ponghae-5 was probably related to the Chinese HQ-16A system, while the Ponghae-6 could be related with the HQ-9 or the Russian S-300.[29]<\/span><br><br>Armchair generals are out in numbers today.","time":1491737296,"resto":120270855,"id":"XBpuiVBX","country":"HU","country_name":"Hungary"},{"no":120272795,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)07:29:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120270855\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120270855<\/a><br>I could sink those ships myself.

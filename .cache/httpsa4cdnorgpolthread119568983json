The left is completely brainwashed on Russia by the media, the fact that a sitting president broke surveillance laws on American citizens in order to push the impeachment agenda on false claims. One side is going down, either Trump, which will be a media driven coup followed by war or The Establishment \/ Deep State are going to prison. Both sides are essentially calling the other out for Treason. Obama is hiding in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. I am telling you right now either one will crash markets so fucking hard there will be suicides all over. Over the next few weeks I would start picking up gold, Bitcoin, or some rubbles.","filename":"1491278553604-pol","ext":".png","w":858,"h":725,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":211,"tim":1491368035757,"time":1491368035,"md5":"Bewrar8iq9z07XPMGK5YBw==","fsize":233272,"resto":0,"id":"CEBbm4ZL","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"happening-economic-collapse-imminent","country_name":"United States","replies":5,"images":2,"unique_ips":6},{"no":119569766,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)01:03:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119568983\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119568983<\/a><br>so same shit different day???","filename":"978","ext":".jpg","w":340,"h":565,"tn_w":75,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491368592859,"time":1491368592,"md5":"2MG8HaKMT1DvVmcHWmG4RQ==","fsize":64453,"resto":119568983,"id":"mmcne3SK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119570057,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)01:06:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119568983\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119568983<\/a><br>Good.","filename":"1482646009423","ext":".jpg","w":400,"h":502,"tn_w":99,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491368780348,"time":1491368780,"md5":"iKNPrf+BE6JXBK\/ybqWMsw==","fsize":97437,"resto":119568983,"id":"iyfHV1CM","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119571407,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)01:21:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119568983\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119568983<\/a><br>I would stay away from Rubles, it could drop even more if we start a war with Putin.

I hope you know that Jesus believed that it happened. Just because the jews of today have been corrupted doesn&#039;t mean we have to deny their persecutions. If the Exodus didn&#039;t happen then everything Jesus said was a lie, and Christianity and Islam are all full of false prophets. Unless you are a heathen you couldn&#039;t possible believe such a thing, right \/pol\/? Obviously the Holocaust didn&#039;t happen but it doesn&#039;t mean we have to deny Hebrew slavery. The Hebrews and Israelites of back then are not the same as the Jews of todays.","filename":"egypt","ext":".png","w":1440,"h":819,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":142,"tim":1492047440507,"time":1492047440,"md5":"EzZRsWwrc3r3PTfaT9i4fw==","fsize":1341271,"resto":0,"id":"W819N2e7","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"exodus-deniers-get-out-pol-will-always-be-a","country_name":"United States","replies":20,"images":4,"unique_ips":15},{"no":120848793,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)21:52:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120846681\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120846681<\/a><br>Sure.

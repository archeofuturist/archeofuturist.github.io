I hope you know that Jesus believed that it happened. Just because the jews of today have been corrupted doesn&#039;t mean we have to deny their persecutions. If the Exodus didn&#039;t happen then everything Jesus said was a lie, and Christianity and Islam are all full of false prophets. Unless you are a heathen you couldn&#039;t possible believe such a thing, right \/pol\/? Obviously the Holocaust didn&#039;t happen but it doesn&#039;t mean we have to deny Hebrew slavery.

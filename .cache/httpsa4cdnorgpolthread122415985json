The \u201canti-Slavic\u201d and \u201canti-Russian\u201d claims are merely the product of postwar propaganda, reliant on the fact that almost no one would have the chance to actually read the publication for themselves.<br>The reason for this was that after the war, the Allied occupying powers in Germany ordered all copies of the publication seized and burned. As a result, only a tiny handful were saved, and it is from one of these very few surviving copies, that this edition has been prepared.<br>In addition to its rarity, the text has also never been correctly and fully translated into English (until now), a fact which has greatly eased the task of those seeking to distort what it actually says.<br>Ideologically hostile Jewish propagandists have, for example, engaged in outright forgery and misrepresentation of its contents, while a single translation made by an ideologically sympathetic postwar publisher suffered from serious grammatical and translation distortion errors.<br>This edition is therefore the very first complete and accurate translation into English of this 52 page oversize booklet.<br>Far from being anti-Slavic, the reader will see that the SS Head Office publication portrayed Russians as victims of Communism\u2014and then specifically blamed Jews as being behind Communism, and, ideologically speaking, inheritors of a far older, far eastern attack on Europe which had started with Genghis Khan and the Mongols.

Austria-Hungary was pretty good for us, but it took us a revolution to achieve it. Of course you were jealous of our privileges, but you have never raised arms against your German overlords since the 30 years war, and even then it was the typical spineless Czech fashion, pushing people out of the windows. Rebellions or proper warfare are alien to the Czech spirit, ass-licking and then spieneless backstabbing suits you way more.","time":1492967250,"resto":122415985,"id":"VJWEFGhz","country":"HU","country_name":"Hungary"},{"no":122448833,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)13:07:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122435833\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122435833<\/a><br>rare","time":1492967255,"resto":122415985,"id":"hkRJWEDh","country":"BA","country_name":"Bosnia and Herzegovina"},{"no":122448996,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)13:08:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122424625\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122424625<\/a><br>I was about to say Italy should know the flag of it&#039;s neighbors, but I guess I&#039;m not much better","time":1492967326,"resto":122415985,"id":"xsGP3e9L","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":122449648,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)13:13:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122427088\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122427088<\/a><br>Hell future white nu-germany if it ever happens!","filename":"1492788045411","ext":".jpg","w":960,"h":540,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1492967611144,"time":1492967611,"md5":"uqnzQbtb0mG3Ye971G\/sSA==","fsize":70650,"resto":122415985,"id":"eS4BS+Jl","country":"AR","country_name":"Argentina"},{"no":122449860,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)13:14:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122415985\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122415985<\/a><br>Of course I do.

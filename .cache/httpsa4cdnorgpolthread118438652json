We doxxed CTR with precision unlike anything you have seen before and got the shills to delete their LinkedIn accounts out of sheer terror.<br><br>Tell me sweetie, do you think your little raid will be any more successful than the ones done by the faggots we&#039;ve defeated in the past?<br><br>Um... no.<br><br>We&#039;ll learn your tactics and turn them against you.<br><br>We&#039;ll spot your threads and report them.<br><br>And if you still keep this sit up, we&#039;ll go on 8 chan and look for your personal info.<br><br>You won&#039;t know what hit you and we&#039;ll make a joke out of your pathetic little shill force in a matter of months.<br><br>So by all means, keep trying to fuck with \/pol\/.

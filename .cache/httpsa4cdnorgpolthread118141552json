My understanding is that fascism is closer to monarchy or dictatorships, which would make sense as being &quot;far right&quot; in Europe since that was the previous way of government, but in the US wouldn&#039;t the furthest right simply mean classical liberalism since that was the founding ideology of the country? Just wondering what this forum would think.","filename":"left-right","ext":".png","w":680,"h":340,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490394061196,"time":1490394061,"md5":"RBE9AnwzfEA0qLIa26uaEw==","fsize":22950,"resto":0,"id":"xjfqobKK","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"is-fascism-correctly-located-on-the-political","country_name":"United States","replies":3,"images":1,"unique_ips":3},{"no":118141815,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)18:22:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"One Axis political spectrums are garbage","time":1490394165,"resto":118141552,"id":"osUPPkVY","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118142169,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)18:25:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118141815\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118141815<\/a><br>I agree they are very misleading.","time":1490394322,"resto":118141552,"id":"xjfqobKK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118142500,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)18:27:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"Left-Right comes from the French Revolution, between those who wanted radical change who sat on the left side of national assembly and those who wanted to keep things as they were who sat on the right side of national assembly, however since the French revolution there has been political developments in individualism vs collectivism, pic related is more reliable in a modern sense.","filename":"JjcJ8GE","ext":".png","w":795,"h":718,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":112,"tim":1490394470203,"time":1490394470,"md5":"AOcnOPeVDurSAen3\/GS8JA==","fsize":129428,"resto":118141552,"id":"f+xFS\/wB","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"}]}

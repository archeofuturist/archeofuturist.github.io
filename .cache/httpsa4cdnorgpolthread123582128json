I still voted for Trump. Honestly I most politically align with Teddy Roosevelt who would be considered a classical liberal. The word liberal today has kind of lost its original meaning. Now it just means some dumb progressive cunt that has 0 critical thinking skills democrats definitely don&#039;t represent us even if they claim to do. So I really wouldn&#039;t worry about it. Seem like your a moderate more than anything desu.","filename":"Mudkip","ext":".gif","w":421,"h":544,"tn_w":96,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493616018162,"time":1493616018,"md5":"odJ\/+1cegyviucDJCNG\/XA==","fsize":37468,"resto":123582128,"id":"d1vtkYLC","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123583102,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)01:24:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123582722\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123582722<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;73% left wing econ<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;But relatively libertarian<\/span><br>Makes sense<br> He&#039;s like Angela Merkel","filename":"Screenshot_20170429-041247","ext":".png","w":1440,"h":2560,"tn_w":70,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493616247415,"time":1493616247,"md5":"DFSu6OX+s5TbaDq4MN6sdg==","fsize":419349,"resto":123582128,"id":"9qyEohaR","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

This is the result of right winged politics. Of your hate. Its not like I asked to be born here either.","filename":"79999","ext":".jpg","w":225,"h":317,"tn_w":177,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493519381698,"time":1493519381,"md5":"Geo12dN9XGYzaRw\/wpjbVg==","fsize":41945,"resto":0,"id":"E7m8sJlO","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"so-i-dont-normally-do-stuff-like-this-but-there","country_name":"Canada","replies":7,"images":1,"unique_ips":6},{"no":123423014,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)22:31:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"Kimi No Na Wa is great!","time":1493519488,"resto":123422807,"id":"4wbs9+ak","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123423068,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)22:31:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123422807\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123422807<\/a><br>I actually pirated and watched that movie months ago.<br>Boring as fuck, might as well stare at paint drying. <br>Pretty drawings here and there though, good animators.","time":1493519514,"resto":123422807,"id":"x\/ZO4GV6","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123423204,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)22:33:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123422807\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123422807<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;SAAAGGGE THIS CANCEROUS SHIT<\/span><br><br>p.s. shave off your pube beard retard","filename":"1470029432793","ext":".jpg","w":612,"h":612,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493519591776,"time":1493519591,"md5":"Sj+hpCS+Sn5KipXi3TeFSA==","fsize":54943,"resto":123422807,"id":"vG1rDkc3","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123423217,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)22:33:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123423068\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123423068<\/a><br>Wait shit no I was thinking of a different movie.

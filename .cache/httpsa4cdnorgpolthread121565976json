For Our policy it is of the greatest importance to take cognisance of this detail; it will be of<br>assistance to us when we come to consider the division of<br>authority, freedom of speech, of the press, of religion (faith),<br>of the law of association, of equality before the law, of the<br>inviolability of property, of the dwelling, of taxation (the idea<br>of concealed taxes), of the reflex force of the laws. All these<br>questions are such as ought not to be touched upon directly and<br>openly before the people. In cases where it is indispensable to<br>touch upon them they must not be categorically named, it must<br>merely be declared without detailed exposition that the<br>principles of contemporary law are acknowledged by us. The reason<br>of keeping silence in this respect is that by not naming a<br>principle we leave ourselves freedom of action, to drop this or<br>that out of it without attracting notice; if they were all<br>categorically named they would all appear to have been already<br>given.","filename":"jews 8","ext":".jpg","w":815,"h":839,"tn_w":121,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492457377280,"time":1492457377,"md5":"f+lK4JIY7yuQ4d6xb34b1g==","fsize":365779,"resto":121565976,"id":"LsIVefF3","country":"US","trip":"!XxDeJ9XhQ2","country_name":"United States"}]}

Immigrants generally contribute rather than withdraw from the economy. Also illegal immigrants may well have set up a family here. Therefore there should be a pathway to citizenship for those who are contributing and have jobs. If they&#039;re not doing anything of use then perhaps deportation is a good path to take.<br>2. What can realistically be done about legal immigrants who don&#039;t want to integrate? It&#039;s a free choice. Would you send someone to jail if they refused to watch football? My point is that it&#039;s hard to punish.

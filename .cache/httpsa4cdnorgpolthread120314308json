Immigrants generally contribute rather than withdraw from the economy. Also illegal immigrants may well have set up a family here. Therefore there should be a pathway to citizenship for those who are contributing and have jobs. If they&#039;re not doing anything of use then perhaps deportation is a good path to take.<br>2. What can realistically be done about legal immigrants who don&#039;t want to integrate? It&#039;s a free choice. Would you send someone to jail if they refused to watch football? My point is that it&#039;s hard to punish. Obviously integration is good but so is multiculturalism.","time":1491762695,"resto":120314308,"id":"mChYdg+1","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120315642,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)14:32:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120315226\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120315226<\/a><br>Third world countries are not comparable to first world countries","time":1491762779,"resto":120314308,"id":"mChYdg+1","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120315940,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)14:35:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120314308\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120314308<\/a><br>Prove to me that multiculturalism on its own (i.e. not the few high-skill immigrants who might result from it) brings any objective benefits to a society.","time":1491762922,"resto":120314308,"id":"JDRV+Ilx","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120316842,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)14:41:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120315453\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120315453<\/a><br>you do realise that you can live your current life thanks to western culture. are you really sure that you want to kiss it goodbye? because if you are not going to defend it, they certainly wont.","time":1491763293,"resto":120314308,"id":"QhHH+qg5","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120316879,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)14:41:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120315940\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120315940<\/a><br>1. We become more intelligent with regards to knowledge of other cultures. London and New York are able to trade with so many countries because people there are more aware of other cultures than people in, say, Iran where there is only one culture. This helps to make us more open-minded which fundamentally makes us happier because we experience new things.<br>2. I know you said multiculturalism on its own, but mutliculturalism by its very nature comes with immigrants who bring capital and labour and can push educational standards up. Multiculturalism and immgiration aren&#039;t as separable as your question makes out.<br>3. Culture. When I was a \/pol\/ack this seemed trivial so you may not think it matters. But it extends into all areas of life. Americans like to eat pizza, sushi, Chinese food and listen to reggae or rap music. In fact the burger might not exist if it wasn&#039;t for German immigration.

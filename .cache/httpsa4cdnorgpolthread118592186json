All trade entered a Rome trading post and very little petty cash \/ gold was maintained on site. All trade, from metal to grain was settled in a major Rome trading House. <br>- A modern example would be no matter where you were in NATO, you would have to open a banking account with The Clinton Foundation, and hope Bill Clinton did not take your funds for his personal project. They usually did back then. Local Slavs &amp; Hun tribes didn&#039;t like that much.<br>- After the fall of the roman empire, Rome pulled back the troops, leaving villages and clans to fend for themselves. Nobles, made up of ex-Roman Equines (Knights) became the Deminse and defenders of their old realms. <br>- To prevent 1 or more Deminse from making a cartel and racketeering other nobles (and their communities) the church deemed loan sharking &amp; highway tolls illegal. Jewish merchants stepped in to finance illegal good fencing from merchant bandits, and loan goods out at high rates.<br>- The middle ages had a bad 40 year &quot;dry spell&quot; and crop yields fell. Economies stagnated, much like today after the Clinton &quot;Subprime Depression&quot;. <br>- Laid off people and poor knights got angry<br>- Some turned to robbery and slavery.

Think Proto-Bitcoin &amp; Proto-internet Clans.<br>- Jews and their Debitor Kings got upset and tried to outlaw Monestary Finance which was a direct competition to the Ursary banking practices in Amsterdam and Italy.<br>- People in the Balkans and Spainish Moores realized the Knights were good &amp; fair, bound by their oaths to a moral code and would work with debitors to build communities, protect roads &amp; make irrigation systems vs. the banditry &amp; confiscation of the Merchant Cartel.<br>(want to know more Y\/N ?)","filename":"Dalmatia","ext":".jpg","w":214,"h":236,"tn_w":214,"tn_h":236,"tim":1490664476893,"time":1490664476,"md5":"BFjA\/r6HfHty1leb0H8t9A==","fsize":14477,"resto":0,"id":"BIfe1hmX","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"deus-vult-red-label-finely-aged-redpills","country_name":"Canada","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

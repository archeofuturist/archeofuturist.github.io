We have Giant Boars\/Hogs and Razorbacks here. Fucking boars are nothing to fuck with, Iv&#039;e seen them maul bears to death, and can get bigger than them here. Every time i go camping or to the woods I have to bring a weapon. No one is scarred of bears here, hell we chase them off and fuck with them. Boars we shoot on sight and you need no license to hunt them. We are also about to pay hunters to kill boars. These fuckers will stab you with their bacteria infested tusks and maul you with them and their teeth, they instinctively go for the face and throat, they fuck up a lot of shit here. I never understood why back in the day coat of arms would have a boar on them until i saw some shit. Pic related. A giant boar that was killed in Florida about 20 miles from me. It charged him on sight and he shot it.","filename":"1100lbsoffuckyou","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":480,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1493295707861,"time":1493295707,"md5":"nXXJy61opbpqIe6whCwoww==","fsize":47118,"resto":123029241,"id":"uoBwwvYY","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123032642,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)08:48:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123030261\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123030261<\/a><br>The fuck.

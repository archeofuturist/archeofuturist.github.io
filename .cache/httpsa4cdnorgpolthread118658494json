The last thing Christianity needs is yet another debate on the small stuff. <br><br>We are one through the Lord, our God.<br><br>Below this post, anons will enter this thread to sow division. They may start with a small issue or a large issue, they&#039;re just attempting to plant a seed of doubt.<br><br>Ignore them. That&#039;s all you have to do.<br><br>Other anons will enter this thread and attack those who sow the division and try to get others to follow their lead and only their lead. They&#039;ll accuse you of doing nothing to defend their position. <br><br>Ignore them, too, for they are one and the same.<br><br>They will attempt to divide you and get you to battle on topics like Atheism, Homosexuality, petty Politics, Economics, anything to get you to crack. They will bring up Blacks, Hispanics, Asians, Arabs, Whites. They will bring up women. They will attack you and try to make you admit fault. They will attack me. <br><br>Ignore them. Center yourself. In fact, don&#039;t even reply to this thread. For it is you, anon reading this who doesn&#039;t reply, who understands. And you will know this is true for I have told you of it.<br><br>They want the divide. Encourage the divide. To weaken. To widen the pit so no bridge can be built and all fall in. <br><br>And, perhaps the saddest of all, they think their agenda is hidden. And they hate when it is exposed. For it reveals their true character as the ugliest of all things.<br><br>Unite under the cross. Some say time doesn&#039;t repeat itself but it rhymes. We&#039;ve had to do this before. We&#039;ll likely have to do it again.<br><br>Unite under the cross.<br><br>I leave you with Numbers 6:24-26, that foreshadowed the Trinity revealed in the New Testament.<br><br>May the Lord bless you and keep you.<br>May the Lord make his face shine on you, <br>and be gracious to you.<br>May the Lord lift up his countenance upon you, <br>and give you peace.","filename":"5871675d7b7f6103e35c6c88","ext":".png","w":2000,"h":2792,"tn_w":179,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490714376232,"time":1490714376,"md5":"XhCUF+AtFhvqE40DTCupbw==","fsize":51793,"resto":0,"id":"a9nzhsQO","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"unite-under-the-cross","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":118658702,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)11:21:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118658494\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118658494<\/a><br>God doesn&#039;t exist.<br><br>FPBP<br><br>\/thread","time":1490714484,"resto":118658494,"id":"1QuWgQKk","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

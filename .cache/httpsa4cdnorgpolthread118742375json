It&#039;s a rare thing. The fact that that occurs and the fact that it is part of our legal rights is at the cornerstone of Western culture, and it&#039;s the thing that needs to be protected at all costs unless you want to be a slave or a tyrant, and lots of people want to be slaves, and lots of people want to be tyrants. <br><br>&quot;Freedom is not something that makes people happy. It is not for happiness. It is for nobility. It is for high quality of life. It is so that you can have a life that&#039;s worth living, to bear some responsibility and to act in a manner that you can live with.

The claim is that he helped terrorism by showing how to penetrate a cheap &quot;stabproof&quot; vest. They&#039;re pretty much implying Keith Palmer, some PM who got stabbed by a muslim last week, learnt how to plan hit attack by watching stuff like Joerg&#039;s content.<br><br>Anyway some questions. Why does the old media resort to slandering youtube stars these days? Because the sjw&#039;s think it&#039;s cool to get someone fired? I think it&#039;s just the income it generates by giving more traffic, but it&#039;s at a huge cost of their cradibility and long term.<br><br>Also the original article is long as balls, yet fails to mention the problem of terrorism itself.

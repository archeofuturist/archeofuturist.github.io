AN OPPORTUNITY FOR HAPPINESS THROUGH COLLECTIVE ACTION.<br><br>I will not let humanity pointlessly suffer any longer. I have laid the groundwork to annihilate all pointless destructiveness and suffering. But collective action is needed to enact change.<br><br>Do you ever experience a feeling of deep powerlessness at all the destructiveness of the world around you? Stop jacking off and start forming a revolution.<br><br>I didn&#039;t feel like creating a post to conform to the standard shitpost of pol. I needed to make this a post that would stand out. You are humanity&#039;s only hope. The time is now. The window is closing, and after it closes, only widespread destruction (may) lead to the rebirth of humanity, in which we (may) try again. It wouldn&#039;t be us trying again, we&#039;d be the ones pointlessly suffering our whole lives.","filename":"foundation","ext":".jpg","w":350,"h":500,"tn_w":175,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491962768183,"time":1491962768,"md5":"2pGWcznNp1x4jGFbyHvQZQ==","fsize":19933,"resto":0,"id":"MlqsoKL4","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"foundation-general","country_name":"United States","replies":8,"images":1,"unique_ips":5},{"no":120698975,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)22:22:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"BUMPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP","time":1491963726,"resto":120697160,"id":"MlqsoKL4","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120700012,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)22:31:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120697160\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120697160<\/a><br>Sage.<br><br>Fuck communism","time":1491964311,"resto":120697160,"id":"FZks3E2f","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120700330,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)22:34:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120698975\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120698975<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;bumpppppp <\/span><br>Why don&#039;t faggots stretch out the letter that&#039;s actually being extended?<br><br>Buuuuuuump.<br><br>You wouldn&#039;t say fuckkkkkkkk, it would be fuuuuuuuuuuuck.","time":1491964474,"resto":120697160,"id":"sNgH\/Eor","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120700345,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)22:34:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"Got an online version PDF or ePub?","time":1491964482,"resto":120697160,"id":"sQlfEaK5","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120700730,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)22:38:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120700345\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120700345<\/a><br>www.thefoundationpress.com\/thefound<wbr>ationforexploration.html Go down a little and you will see the link.

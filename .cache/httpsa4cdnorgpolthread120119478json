When the Iraq war started back in 2003 America didn&#039;t have as much denbt as it has now. The budget just isn&#039;t there for another protracted war. <br><br>Merkel and the EU in general were right all along. Drumpfkins and Brexshitters must be feeling like retards right now. It&#039;s ok to admit you were wrong though, nobody will laugh at you, anyone can be wrong at times. What is truly ridiculous though is if you keep refusing to admit your mistake.","filename":"nato-nations-jpg_506419_20170119-684","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":480,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1491649957597,"time":1491649957,"md5":"MfcGyl7w20bzoS19\/1+abQ==","fsize":43230,"resto":0,"id":"DCrugsB2","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-real-reason-why-trump-wants-european","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

The Georgia congressional candidate and former campaign surrogate for President Trump stands 6 feet 4 and weighs 240 pounds \u2014 slightly bigger than the chief executive himself.<br><br>LeVell similarly wants to be an imposing presence backing up Trump\u2019s agenda in Congress. He describes his goal as \u201cbringing the hammer\u201d for Trump, who doesn\u2019t command a bloc of establishment Republicans on Capitol Hill.<br><br>And LeVell is running in an unusually crowded and high-profile race. He\u2019s one of 18 candidates vying to fill the seat that was left empty when Trump made former congressman Tom Price his secretary of health and human services. The vote will take place on April 18, making it one of just a handful of special congressional elections taking place this year<br><br>The race in the staunchly Republican district in the suburbs of Atlanta will be an early test of Trump\u2019s personal popularity and how his agenda is playing among voters who supported him in 2016. LeVell is campaigning largely on his ties to and support of the president. While the district has long been a Republican stronghold, Trump beat Democrat Hillary Clinton by just 1.5 percent there in the presidential race.","filename":"ed798bcf1b762c86b1273654be98afc2","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":853,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1490073561492,"time":1490073561,"md5":"SaKF4Iyqkg94mv12ZyIGKg==","fsize":103372,"resto":0,"id":"ULYG\/pKT","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"trumps-hammer-bruce-levell","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":1,"unique_ips":1},{"no":117591561,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)01:20:38","name":"Anonymous","filename":"536e73b588fa6865b103b7b2030f4761","ext":".gif","w":900,"h":257,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":35,"tim":1490073638911,"time":1490073638,"md5":"gHWORBaSqvDdFTShrv0lyw==","fsize":10364,"resto":117591453,"id":"ULYG\/pKT","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

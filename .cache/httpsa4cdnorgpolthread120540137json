What seems to have started Michael\u2019s financial decline was when in 1993, he paid the family of 13 year old Jordy Chandler, $22 million dollars to settle the lawsuit they had pending against him. From that point forward he was not really viewed the same, his last album was a failure and yet his taste for expensive things and his ability to spend became legendary. But did you know that in 1985, Michael Jackson paid $47.5 million dollars to purchase and ATV Music Publishing, which happened to own the copyrights of more than 200 songs written by the Beatles\u2019 John Lennon and Paul McCartney? While Michael Jackson will likely be remembered for many things, perhaps right now we should focus on what he did that made him the icon he was. There will be plenty of time later for the sordid details, and the unsavory side of the pop legend, but there were aspects to Michael\u2019s life that demonstrate him to be almost a Renaissance man; namely Michael the inventor, Michael the King of Pop and Michael the shrewd businessman who say the value of owning perhaps the most lucrative copyright portfolio of all time.<\/span><br><br>http:\/\/www.ipwatchdog.com\/2009\/07\/0<wbr>1\/michael-jackson-and-the-beatles-c<wbr>opyrights\/id=4363\/","filename":"dj_mj","ext":".jpg","w":634,"h":498,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":98,"tim":1491883164526,"time":1491883164,"md5":"Zhk+2gWLA6bmu1kfnqUaQA==","fsize":64243,"resto":120540137,"id":"mv4KTXT+","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120549301,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)23:59:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"it explains a lot, it&#039;s why he literally made a sanctuary for kids and why all of the children who grew up around him never had anything bad to say about him.<br><br>There was one allegation by an &quot;anonymous&quot; kid who said he had a spotted penis- but that was an isolated case which we never heard from again.<br><br>I think if he was really a pedophile people would be speaking out against him post-mortem- especially if the narrative is that &quot;they&#039;re afraid of retaliation&quot;<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;when that failed, they just killed him via his Dr.<\/span><br><br>http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2011\/11\/08\/u<wbr>s\/doctor-found-guilty-in-michael-ja<wbr>cksons-death.html?_r=0<br><br>Michael Jackson, among the most famous performers in pop music history, spent his final days in a sleep-deprived haze of medication and misery until finally succumbing to a fatal dose of potent drugs provided by the private physician he had hired to act as his personal pharmaceutical dispensary, a jury decided on Monday.<br><br>The physician, Dr. Conrad Murray, was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter nearly two and a half years after Jackson\u2019s shocking death at age 50.

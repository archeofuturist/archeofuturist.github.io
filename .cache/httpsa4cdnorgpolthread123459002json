Anime has been gradually becoming more and more detached from reality because its most reliable fanbase are NEETs with metric fucktons of free time on their hands who have reached higher states of autism and are unable to communicate with other human beings or leave their house.<br><br>2. Said NEETs have no idea what actual girls look like and since they have never even touched a girl they instead prefer fapping to their oversexualized, non-realistic waifus.<br><br>3. These NEETs also have their welfare money to spend on merchandise, so they can end up filling their closets with figurines,wallpapers,bodypillows etc. all having been fapped and ejaculated on at least once.<br><br>4. The West caught the trend and the industry is now also trying to appeal to weeb NEETs as well, so its degenerate mechandise market can reach places outside of japan with its filthy sweat,cum and dorito crumb covered hands.<br><br>5. Company funded doujinshi market. Doujinshi is basically an illustrated fanfic by an amateur manga artist. Yes, they fucking sell hentai fanfics to people. And it makes them a fuckton of cash.<br><br>Point is, NEETs and antisocial cucks ruined anime.","time":1493545256,"resto":123459002,"id":"OcU5a6ek","country":"GR","country_name":"Greece"},{"no":123461524,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)05:41:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123459002\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123459002<\/a><br>Futa","time":1493545300,"resto":123459002,"id":"WAnnXlBy","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123461698,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)05:44:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"Feels bad we only have gotten one good show this year, but man was it great.","filename":"1493497282040","ext":".png","w":1600,"h":1600,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493545444037,"time":1493545444,"md5":"7CQM9spt+t\/aQ31Lan2Rvg==","fsize":302486,"resto":123459002,"id":"EHs1Mpk4","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"}]}

While cooperating with law enforcement in a drug investigation, Judi died when her house burned down. No cause for the fire was found. Judy had called the fire department to report the fire, but her body was found on the floor in front of a ground floor window, near a door that would have allowed her escape. In a sworn statement, Clinton bodyguard Barry Spivey related how he had been with the governor when the governor&#039;s plane had flown over Judi Gibb&#039;s house and Clinton had shown Judi&#039;s penthouse photos on the plane and pointed out the house.","time":1493268697,"resto":122994509,"id":"KMJAAoec","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122996847,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)00:51:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"@122996693<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;shils have resorted to racist, sexist, and ableist slurs<\/span>","time":1493268698,"resto":122994509,"id":"2oNY4rdJ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122996900,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)00:52:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"When is the Healthcare vote?","filename":"Botsford170412Trump13901","ext":".jpg","w":1484,"h":989,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1493268736049,"time":1493268736,"md5":"48CKu4FPPL8T4WqP0QKnqw==","fsize":189881,"resto":122994509,"id":"qqd\/km8T","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":122996933,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)00:52:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122996768\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122996768<\/a><br>Its funny that Ferguson was actually the tipping point for Trump to run for Prez.

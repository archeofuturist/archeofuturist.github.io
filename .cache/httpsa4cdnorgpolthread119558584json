Is it a net benefit for us to form alliances (temporary or more lasting) with other groups on the right? <br><br>Utilizing civic nationalists, libertarians, fundamentalist christians, paleocons etc., helps greatly to boost our influence. The left has been using disparate minority and interest groups in a unified struggle against whitey and normalcy to pretty good effect for a few decades now. Maybe we should steal their tactic? The Trump phenomenon used this to some degree. And while Trump is only a marginal improvement for nationalists in terms of policy so far, I think we can all agree he has done much to shift the Overton Window in our direction.<br> <br>Solidarity is also beneficial considering the increasingly dire demographic situation the US is in. We just simply don&#039;t have the numbers to fight off the united rainbow coalition of the left if the right is splintered into 1000 groups. Allying allows us a bigger presence in the culture and provides us an opportunity to expose, and hopefully draw, others to our ideologies. <br><br>On the other hand, I see major issues with a big tent strategy. The most obvious is the potential of subversion. The united right is only desirable if the right&#039;s leadership are wielding it to further our goals. If the united right is being wielded by a neocon we are only helping to dig our own graves. <br>Consorting with civic nationalists, libertarians and &quot;mainstream&quot; republicans risks diluting\/polluting our message and allows moderates to piggyback on hard right populist appeal. Could Trump or any other republican president have won without the racist vote? Obviously not. <br><br>I fear that empowering these half measure nationalists like Trump only release pressure on the system and actually prolong the reign of the current disastrous paradigm. I can&#039;t decide if it&#039;s a net positive for Nationalists and others on the &quot;far right&quot; to form these alliances What are your thoughts?","filename":"1489105927350","ext":".png","w":800,"h":800,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491361776159,"time":1491361776,"md5":"oiYCO1RyZCo3cpouSdC6dA==","fsize":448231,"resto":0,"id":"rQ3qGlUY","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"united-we-win","country_name":"United States","replies":5,"images":4,"unique_ips":4},{"no":119558701,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)23:10:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119558584\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119558584<\/a><br>United we stand.<br>Divided we fall.","filename":"1488941242164","ext":".png","w":1000,"h":1000,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491361842462,"time":1491361842,"md5":"8hZ9oyvvSmLAMXfXzC3JXQ==","fsize":175535,"resto":119558584,"id":"fa9\/xpqP","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119559276,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)23:16:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119558701\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119558701<\/a><br>Yes but uniting has hurt us in the past.

California courts require twice the bail amount if property is used instead of cash.<br><br>Li&#039;s attorney Geoff Carr says Li and her mother were born in China, where the mother was financially successful in the construction industry. Carr says Li and her mother are naturalized U.S. citizens.<br><br>Carr said all defendants except those accused of death penalty-eligible crimes are entitled to &quot;reasonable bail.&quot;<br><br>The $35 million bail is the highest ever in San Mateo County&#039;s history, a county official said.<br><br>San Mateo District Attorney Steve Wagstaffe said he&#039;s concerned Li is a flight risk and is disappointed the judge didn&#039;t set the bail even higher. His office asked for a $100 million bail.<br><br>&quot;If convicted she faces the rest of her life in prison,&quot; Wagstaffe said. &quot;That&#039;s plenty enough incentive to flee back to her native China.&quot;","filename":"TiffanyLi","ext":".jpg","w":288,"h":216,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1491468004403,"time":1491468004,"md5":"6Eq6nh9bkRvmJPMwKqdMKA==","fsize":7029,"resto":0,"id":"864bHFmd","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"murderer-mom-raised-unprecented-35mil-bail-with-a","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":119722299,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)04:44:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119722055\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119722055<\/a><br>bump","time":1491468267,"resto":119722055,"id":"eZ4Gek5d","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

Indeed, not long after Penn State had commenced their attack on Kek, they asserted their status as a safe space. While this reply is hostile to free speech it contained no threat or hint of war or attack.<br><br>It will be recorded that the time to set up the show at Penn State makes it obvious that the attack was deliberately planned many days or even weeks ago. During the intervening time Penn State has deliberately sought to deceive Kek by false statements and expressions of hope for constructive dialogue.<br><br>The attack today on Kek has caused minor damage to Kek&#039;s memetic warfare divisions. I regret to tell you that many Conservatives have been mocked. In addition attacks on Kek&#039;s Faithful have been reported across the internet from Twitter to Reddit.<br><br>Today the liberals also launched an attack at Berkeley.<br>March 4th Antifa forces pepper sprayed an old man.<br>January 20th libtard forces attacked the inauguration.<br>November 8th Communists attacked democracy.<br>For many months Shill forces have attacked \/pol\/.<br>And even now Antifa attacks a peaceful rally.<br><br>Liberals have therefore undertaken a surprise offensive extending throughout the country and internet. The facts of the last several months and today speak for themselves. The Faithful of Kek have already formed their opinions and well understand the implications to the very life and safety of our nation.<br><br>As a fellow meme warrior I ask how can we better strike back at our enemies? We must always remember the character of the onslaught against us. . .","filename":"declarationofwar","ext":".jpg","w":660,"h":604,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":228,"tim":1493316696557,"time":1493316696,"md5":"xFO+6hxEZf5GbVcbVI0loA==","fsize":71247,"resto":0,"id":"EZV85uvb","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"penn-state-just-put-up-art-depicting-a-crucified","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":123065860,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)14:13:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123065636\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123065636<\/a><br><br>they are afraid and shaking<br><br>this only helps kek","time":1493316799,"resto":123065636,"id":"pAiJol9Y","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]}

Those around him nodded, and hunched up against the cold.<br>(((Left-wing activists))) in Budapest have little faith in American political elites,or their own. Trump\u2019s victory may sanctify the illiberal policies of their own governmental strongman, prime minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n. Trump and Orb\u00e1n have superficial similarities, including their use of divisive ideology and anti-migrant sentiment.<br>But unlike in the USOrb\u00e1n\u2019s nationalism faces a society with little mainstream left-liberal opposition. As such, Budapest\u2019s small activist population needs to be creative to subvert Orb\u00e1n, who has tightened his grip on state-funded media and major cultural institutions. In doing so, the activists are rethinking the relationship between citizenship and creativity.","filename":"01 Sweden yes","ext":".png","w":465,"h":465,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":249,"tim":1491477539774,"time":1491477539,"md5":"3Krlg30LgARJD2reY1SXlA==","fsize":192771,"resto":0,"id":"C1aNujGZ","country":"ME","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"kike-askshow-to-subvert-right-wing-orban","country_name":"Montenegro","replies":7,"images":1,"unique_ips":3},{"no":119733010,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)07:27:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119732357\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119732357<\/a><br>Ta av proxyn Bengt.","time":1491478054,"resto":119732357,"id":"Fstzhm2h","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":119733227,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)07:30:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"SchioFrenia?","time":1491478223,"resto":119732357,"id":"lLPm2Ggp","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":119733363,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)07:32:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119733010\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119733010<\/a><br>Who is Bengt?","time":1491478339,"resto":119732357,"id":"C1aNujGZ","country":"ME","country_name":"Montenegro"},{"no":119733533,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)07:34:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119733363\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119733363<\/a><br>are you mentally sick of what is this <br><br>speak more down to earth for us plebs","time":1491478484,"resto":119732357,"id":"lLPm2Ggp","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":119733699,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)07:37:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119733533\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119733533<\/a><br>Your country is mentally sick.

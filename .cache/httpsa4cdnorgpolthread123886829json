Sure they can knock someone out, so it&#039;s not a pushover martial art, but they do stupid shit all the time and have shit tier habits thanks to focusing on point sparring instead of staying alive. Ex. They use both of their arms to pin someone down without controlling their opponent&#039;s arms. In real life I am going to stab the everliving shit out of someone trying that, or I could gouge their eyes out. Being pinned causes me no harm in itself and without controlling me, I can do serious injury to them while they earn their stupid points. In sparring, I used a fist with the middle knuckle out and punch the crap out of this dude&#039;s rib cage. My opponent won because he won more points but he was black and blue for a week and stood up to a victory struggling to breath while I was still at 100%. I could have hit him harder too. After they picked him to send off to competitions I decided this was a stupid martial art to spend time with.<br><br>Maybe that doesn&#039;t tell all there is about jujitsu, but it&#039;s my experience.

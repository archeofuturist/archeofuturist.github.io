It sends hundreds of thousands of children hunting for Easter eggs on historic properties across the country on Easter weekend.<br><br>The decision was considered such an affront to traditionalists that none less than the Archbishop of York and Prime Minister Theresa May intervened to express dismay.<br><br>The archbishop, John Sentamu, lamented that omitting an explicit Easter reference was akin to \u201cspitting on the grave\u201d of John Cadbury, a Quaker who founded the company, which initially sold cocoa and drinking chocolate, in Birmingham in 1824.","filename":"eastereggs","ext":".jpg","w":960,"h":540,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1491344954144,"time":1491344954,"md5":"iTblBgkPRvoJz6\/ZNVza8g==","fsize":165777,"resto":0,"id":"pXKD8UGN","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"cadbury-easter-egg-hunt-loses-the-easter","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":119527478,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)18:35:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119526639\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119526639<\/a><br>bump","time":1491345351,"resto":119526639,"id":"BS9fc1vi","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

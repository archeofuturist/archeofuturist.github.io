It&#039;s not about how much money you spent, but how much artistic control you exercised over the final product.<br><br>So for example, If I pave a sidewalk and then some rain falls on it, I can&#039;t claim a copyright in the sidewalk with raindrops on it, because I had no control over the placement of the drops. But if I took a photograph of the wet sidewalk, the composition of the final work would be controlled by my choice of lens, lighting, exposure, etc and therefore could be copyrightable.<br><br>Anyways, I bring this up because although copyright is a poor proxy for what is and isn&#039;t art, it does provide one way of thinking about what we require of the artist before we are willing to accept his claim that what he made is in fact art. As <a href=\"#p121541602\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121541602<\/a><br> said in your initial post, a mountain isn&#039;t art because there&#039;s no human involvement in its creation.

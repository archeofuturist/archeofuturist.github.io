The Czech Foreign Ministry has repeatedly said that historians, not politicians, should deal with the issue. Experts estimate that up to 1.5 million Armenians were killed by Ottoman Turks around the time of World War I, an event viewed by many scholars as the first genocide of the 20th century. Turkey says the toll has been inflated and considers those killed as victims of a civil war.

Over time the Marines came under increasing enemy fire and there were calls for withdrawal of U.S. forces. Congress, as part of a compromise with the President, passed Public Law 98-119 in October 1983 authorizing U.S. troops to remain in Lebanon for 18 months.

Also the quote you cited is just nitpicking that&#039;s what the original section says but of course the interpretation has changed along with the precedent. besides the obvious test that we could do to see if the original code still stands. The question is, does the president need congressional approval to launch a nuclear strike? and before you go and say that launching a nuclear strike as a response to Russia attacking us as opposed to us launching 60+ cruise missiles into Syria, yes they are different but the method in which the law was written allows both the happen simultaneously.

You need to get your diet in check, stay active, and raise your testosterone. <br><br>DIET<br><br>Drink reverse osmosis or distilled water. (If you do distilled, supplement with minerals.) Avoid drinks with sugar or high fructose corn syrup. Energy drinks are fine but get the zero cal ones. <br><br>Make sure your carbs, proteins, and fats are coming from non-poisoned or non-refined sources. <br><br>Carbs -- get your carbs from clean sources like potatoes, rice, and quinoa. Avoid wheat and sugar at all costs. <br><br>Fats -- get fats from olive oil, nuts, coconut oil, avocado, etc. Avoid hydrogenated oils. <br><br>Protein -- get protein from animals. Bison is packed with more nutrients than beef. Make sure your fish are wild caught and not from sources with mercury. Avoid soy and other processed fake proteins at all costs. <br><br>Veggies and fruits -- get them at your local farmers market and make sure they&#039;re either organic or free of pesticides. <br><br>RAISING TESTOSTERONE<br><br>Get a blood test to see what your level is currently at. Our ancestors had around 1000 ng naturally. To raise it, first try it the natural way, by changing your diet and lifestyle habits. (You can find plenty of info online to do this.) If that does not work -- and it&#039;s still too low -- consider talking to a physician about starting TRT. Under no circumstances should you have low testosterone. <br><br><br>STAYING ACTIVE:<br><br>Whether you lift or practice MMA or ski or jog. Whatever it is you do, you need to make sure of one thing: push the envelope as much as possible. Make it hard on yourself. Embrace pain and suffering, it is what makes you grow. Recover. Then push the envelope even further next time. <br><br>Always remember, if you sit around with your thumb up your ass you are letting the zionists and pedophile ruling class win. They fully intend to create a race of gray sluggish weaklings. The first step in destroying them is to get yourself in order. <br><br>Forge ahead.","filename":"atrazine","ext":".png","w":2490,"h":1625,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":163,"tim":1493570351291,"time":1493570351,"md5":"pBMA52AgxM6VRjOcE43FjA==","fsize":196943,"resto":0,"id":"SbieX39i","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"reminder-transgenderism-is-caused-by-chemical","country_name":"United States","replies":59,"images":8,"unique_ips":37},{"no":123496849,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)12:52:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123495471\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123495471<\/a> <br>bump<br>why dont more people care?","time":1493571160,"resto":123495471,"id":"LeL3D1sT","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123497741,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)13:01:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123496849\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123496849<\/a><br>I care.

Its funny that you mentioned atrazine because this chemical in particular has been proven to cause autism in boys. Xenoestrogenic endocrine disruption in utero feminizes the male body and hyper-masculinizes the male brain. While the latter might sound like a good thing, it actually causes autism. The prevalence of this condition has been growing at an accelerating rate. By 2020, its estimated that 50% of all boys born in the US will be somewhere on this spectrum. Atrazine isn&#039;t the only chemical that does this, but its been well documented.<br><br>Another major symptom is female-birth control. Its super-physiologically doses of estrogen.

I truly hated reddit but would find myself visiting it everyday and constantly refreshing the homepage.

It felt so fucking good to see other people who reject modern liberalism.<br>2017?It seems like memes and general creative energy is declining. I&#039;ve noticed that pepe is hardly posted at all compared to pre-election posting. Less new content in general. How long until normies ruin a good thing? The memes are a-changing.

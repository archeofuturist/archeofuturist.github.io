(That took too long to write for the last thread)<br><br>1. Because nobody will report on it in the US, nobody will believe the international press, and it was necessary to fire off most of our cells for a message to our country. The targeting and self destruct data is set after the initial launch and turn while the missile turns on its mini jet and flies to target. This can be programmed into the missile target data without any launch party knowing.<br><br>2. We don&#039;t want to give the Russians block 4 tomahawk internals, so we had to self destruct or blow them up above the airfield to mitigate the damage to the airfield but destroy everything they could recover because we aren&#039;t idiots<br><br>3. Because one of trumps big talking points during the election was his talking about how out of date our missile tech is compared to the Russians. People only took this to mean Nukes, but this also means our air to air missiles (upgraded since the 80&#039;s based on originals), cruise missiles (same), ground based Heatseeking, any form of SPAAG, the still shit phalanx, and of course, our anti ship missiles which might as well be non existent at this point. <br><br>Working perfectly, the current tomahawk has a 15-20% failure rate and is fairly easily jammable. This massive failure will be seen by the defense department only, and we will get the fire lit under our ass to finally fix these holes in our military. Plus, we will get a great deal on them now, a Trump touch that takes us well on our way to fixing the military industrial bloat. <br><br>Raytheon stock dropped 5 percent after the attack kek","filename":"tmp_17168-1488770297731453802955","ext":".jpg","w":800,"h":423,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":66,"tim":1491676254294,"time":1491676254,"md5":"fe2BS2qQeYd0iVQatKFJlw==","fsize":114612,"resto":120162318,"id":"1PYW92Fr","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120163939,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)14:31:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120163496\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120163496<\/a><br>Knock-knock its real world.

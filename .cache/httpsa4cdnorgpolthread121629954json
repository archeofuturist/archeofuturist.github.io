Some can be armed with smaller round shields to deflect bottles and rocks. The front column locks shields and marches forward while support follows. Antifa will attack from any angle but it will not be effective if 3-5 shields can immediately re-position to face them. Periodically make some openings to bait some wannabe hero antifa into charging, only to be knocked down and tied up while the shield wall closes behind them. Don&#039;t kick them while they&#039;re down (we&#039;re better than that) but have lines of support drag them further back to a holding location for eventual pickup by cops. A liberal dousing of pepperspray can help them settle down until then.","time":1492487513,"resto":121629954,"id":"Spcfs6bQ","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121634038,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)23:54:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121629954\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121629954<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\/pol<\/span>","filename":"1490548509849","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":386,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":96,"tim":1492487651905,"time":1492487651,"md5":"D7fpRRbPccJTGyhefENEcg==","fsize":39011,"resto":121629954,"id":"vpPV7C5j","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121634228,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)23:56:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121631416\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121631416<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;(((Trump))) offering &quot;free helicopter rides&quot; to (((Sanders)))<\/span><br><br>You live in a parallel universe, mate.","time":1492487772,"resto":121629954,"id":"h5ulvdis","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":121634786,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)00:01:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;The stories and information posted here are artistic works of fiction and falsehood.<\/span><br>Only a fool would take anything posted here as fact.<br><br>Antifa like to pretend that they&#039;re soldiers, fighting some war.

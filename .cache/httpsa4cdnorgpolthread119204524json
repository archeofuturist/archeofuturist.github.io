At this point I would gladly die to save Europe.","filename":"Hitler clickbait ad","ext":".gif","w":350,"h":350,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491152180588,"time":1491152180,"md5":"zvoDsYmqO2yyHuhNHrj3nw==","fsize":69755,"resto":119204524,"id":"sa9jAEJR","country":"CH","country_name":"Switzerland"},{"no":119218319,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)12:56:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119218245\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119218245<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;importing shitskins has now become status of how white your country is<\/span><br>I want to get off this wild ride.","filename":"1489438574028","ext":".jpg","w":400,"h":400,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491152185850,"time":1491152185,"md5":"Y+LnJbAfEPA7XdrSIP15Aw==","fsize":21547,"resto":119204524,"id":"tugaakFO","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":119218492,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)12:58:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119218245\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119218245<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;leafs are probably the most qualified people to talk about whiteness<\/span><br>I have not left the basement in a year.

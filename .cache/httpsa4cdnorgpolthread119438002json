If you can\u2019t achieve these things in your real life, then you are not ready to be a political activist, either anonymously or in reality.<br><br>Always remember: we live in first world countries and have opportunity that most people born on this planet don\u2019t. So work your ass off, every day, to build a good life for yourself. How can you help others when you can\u2019t help yourself? Spend your time wisely, and keep your real life priorities in order. Nothing on the internet should ever take away from your real life.","time":1491288078,"resto":119438002,"id":"pbJtNHa9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119441592,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)02:41:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119441532\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119441532<\/a><br>ahahaha","time":1491288085,"resto":119438002,"id":"929a44yQ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119441615,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)02:41:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119441387\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119441387<\/a><br>I was referencing \/our girl\/.","filename":"IMG_0004","ext":".jpg","w":1910,"h":1000,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":65,"tim":1491288103882,"time":1491288103,"md5":"tFOuvsBMuAHUC9+TTQTB6g==","fsize":138983,"resto":119438002,"id":"aDEnTlIj","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":119441622,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)02:41:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119441529\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119441529<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;implying anyone voted for trump for anything but memes<\/span><br>No one thinks he&#039;d actually be a good president","time":1491288113,"resto":119438002,"id":"xex0Fry+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119441627,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)02:41:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119441473\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119441473<\/a><br>Democrat Playbook: use peoples stupidity to make the opposition look stupid.<br><br>Democrats made an actor and an engineer with a bachelors degree look like an actual scientist","filename":"1487020167021","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":891,"tn_w":89,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491288115404,"time":1491288115,"md5":"sw3L5hcWIxr5umtI10F25Q==","fsize":222037,"resto":119438002,"id":"MNgo6RcW","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119441647,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)02:42:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119441473\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119441473<\/a><br>They won&#039;t.

Mass deportations, Gorsuch, etc. Things going amazing.<br><br>In the area of the Military, POTUS Trump has proposed absolutely radical changes to the scheme of not only foreign policy conduct but fundamentally how the military is structured will be changed for the 21st century.<br><br>In the East Asia area, Trump has reestablished far more direct communication with Taiwan unabashedly. South Korea and Japan will not only be paying more for their defense and military cooperation, they have quickly agreed to allow more US presence overnight.<br><br>The cost sharing scheme, as laid out by Eastern US Allies is set to become the standard of cooperation in European nations,as POTUS Trump and SOS Tillerson have said that the era of NATO not meeting spending requirements is now over. NATO will now also be creating and gearing up for counter-terrorism operations and border security to suit the times.<br><br>Furthermore, in the area of East Asia military policy, THAAD has been deployed to SK in a daring move and aid has been cut off from NK no matter how much they saber rattle. It has been floated that Taiwan be recognized by the US as a state once again in order to provide leverage against the expanding Chinese threat.<br><br>Trump&#039;s smart picks to his cabinet have passed without fail, despite one withdrawal and dem obstructionism, and Gorsuch hearings are proceeding far quicker and sooner than expected. Yet another non-Ginsberg SCOTUS nomination is due to be open in summer after Gorsuch is confirmed, leaving room for the second of Trump&#039;s likely 4 SCOTUS picks.","filename":"1484781039555","ext":".jpg","w":590,"h":756,"tn_w":97,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491288196831,"time":1491288196,"md5":"5AHJ4e\/Kqv9DXhj1l9f\/8w==","fsize":51777,"resto":119438002,"id":"\/ZmpJef5","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119441729,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)02:43:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119441385\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119441385<\/a><br>You&#039;re kidding right?","time":1491288198,"resto":119438002,"id":"HrT9+JSv","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":119441826,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)02:44:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119438143\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119438143<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;give illegals free bus rides to California<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;build wall around California<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;no security check upon entry<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;need to be a citizen to leave<\/span><br><br>easy","filename":"1485199670160","ext":".png","w":361,"h":563,"tn_w":80,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491288267252,"time":1491288267,"md5":"YHKKziGSREr1NMXoXZ3P3g==","fsize":325638,"resto":119438002,"id":"n9wZxv3b","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":119441833,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)02:44:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119441729\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119441729<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;You&#039;re kidding right?<\/span>","filename":"a leppo","ext":".gif","w":188,"h":145,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":96,"tim":1491288274836,"time":1491288274,"md5":"c08THj9z5BJcZ\/EGHP6A6Q==","fsize":597193,"resto":119438002,"id":"YIkNqmr1","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

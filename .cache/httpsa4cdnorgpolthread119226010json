If god exists then it doesnt matter what you do or dont do, he has the final say anyways. You can behave however you want, it is up to god to decide what to do with your dumbass. Assuming god even cares or is concerned with the affairs of one group of mortals on just one planet in just one galaxy. You are a brainlet retard who is incapable of independent thought or any kind of personal will. Eugenics is the future. The weak and unworthy will not be allowed to breed.

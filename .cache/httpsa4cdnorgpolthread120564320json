At least compared to their history since the 50s. Cambodia has kept the same regime since the UN invervention in the 90s, although it might change soon since the system is crumbling under the weight of its own corruption and some of its pillars are getting too old to rule and they know it. Laos has remained an isolated authoritarian communist regime. Vietnam has been booming since the introduction of the Doi Moi Laws in the mid-90s (equivalent to the entry of market economy in China ; they did that as well as remove the centralisation of produced goods in cooperatives, and allow privately-owned businesses) and the jury is still out on whether the communist party will take strong counter-measures or continue to liberalize until there is no traces of communism. Thailand is in a worrying state since the recent military coup allowed the army to size power after the democratic regime fell due to its ruling class becoming self-serving, the mix of this authoritarian turn and the death of the only stabilizing force that was King Buhimbol, followed by his much disliked son are not good signs at all.<br>(cont.)","time":1491894847,"resto":120564320,"id":"ndnlQMdA","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":120568419,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)03:14:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120564320\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120564320<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Is it culturally like China or is it more like India?<\/span><br>It is its own thing, really. You can see some chinese and indian influence everywhere of course but in terms of cultural attitudes and heritage most of these places have their own distinct identity. The main difference is religious since most of the continental south-east is buddhist or has been more or less secularized under communism ; Indonesia and Malaya are muslim. These religious divides create a big cultural gap between the south-chinese tradition of taoism and hinduism.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Why is Singapore developed?<\/span><br>Central planning. Harbours were needed and when most of the SEA and chinese coast were ruled by communists who closed themselves from trade routes, the few places that didn&#039;t grew very, very quickly.

Singapore grew with a very strict and precise plan, unlike the rest of Indonesia, think of it as a modern equivalent of a Renaissance city-state that could enrich faster than a duchy thanks to its limited size and concentrated infrastructure.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Why is Thailand the world&#039;s brothel?<\/span><br>Because when all their neighbours were colonies with regulation on prostitution, they had none and reaped the benefits.

I lived in Bangkok for a year in 15-16 so here&#039;s my take on SEA nations. <br><br>Thailand and Vietnam are very nice places and you could live there cheap and still have all the first world stuff, sometimes even better than 1st world. For example in Thailand you can get better dental work for a fraction of the price of Western work and you could BUY a condo in Chiang Mai for 7k USD. And while Thailand is a party country they have super strict laws about drugs and all the police are military because the military runs the country. Thai women are qts and will suck the soul out of your dick for 30 bucks.<br><br>I only spent a couple weeks in Cambodia but it&#039;s alright, they are very very poor and use USD because their money is worthless. You can buy weed pizza there and mushroom shakes(would not recommend going to the killing fields after a mushroom shake like I did, not a fun high) High amounts of pedo shit goes on in Cambodia though and beggars everywhere. <br><br>Spent only a week in Myanmar and it&#039;s scary as shit. Everyone has red teeth and I felt like I was in resident evil. Came to the hotel everyday before sunset. <br><br>Philippines was pretty chill and beautiful in parts but I felt not welcome there. Not much else to say about them <br><br>If ww3 kicked off the only players I see in SEA are Vietnam, Philippines and Indonesia everyone else stays neutral.

First they counted on the stupidity of their adversary, and then, when there was no other way out, they themselves simply played stupid.

Whenever you tried to attack one of these apostles, your hand closed on a jelly-like slime which divided up and poured through your fingers, but in the next moment collected again.

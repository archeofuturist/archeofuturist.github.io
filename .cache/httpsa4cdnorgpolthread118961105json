Be aware that the imigration policies are way more severe in Switzerland than France so the immigration procedures are taking a lot of time. But if you found a cool boss that helps you with that, the immigration papers can be accelerated and you can integrate really fast.<br>If you learn french, and don&#039;t act as the typical &quot;frontalier&quot; that spits on Switzerland but makes happily a ton of money, you&#039;re welcomed.<br>Sadly there are niggers and sandniggers in all the french speaking cities but they are only visible minorities because they spend their time outside. They are only in the center of cities and in poor cities.","filename":"900px-Text-a-Girl-That-You-Like-Step-1","ext":".jpg","w":900,"h":675,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1490910495532,"time":1490910495,"md5":"5TpxOTbzW4dQKoL33CWUSw==","fsize":145392,"resto":118961105,"id":"COL+Z40w","country":"CH","country_name":"Switzerland"},{"no":118973785,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)17:49:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"hey guys can i come to switzerland?","time":1490910592,"resto":118961105,"id":"++n+xzP9","country":"IT","country_name":"Italy"},{"no":118973803,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)17:50:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118972520\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118972520<\/a><br><a href=\"#p118973265\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118973265<\/a><br>I keked","filename":"photo_2017-03-30_22-27-07","ext":".jpg","w":728,"h":546,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1490910601363,"time":1490910601,"md5":"UPSTWhzm3Wld7VU2WfoXig==","fsize":46026,"resto":118961105,"id":"COL+Z40w","country":"CH","country_name":"Switzerland"},{"no":118973859,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)17:50:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118961835\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118961835<\/a><br>My problem with this has always been the Partybeer.

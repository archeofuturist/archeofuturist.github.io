Political sciences are not science. They do not use scientific methods. At best, they are collecting polling data for statistical analysis or analyzing movements of people and such, at worst they just literally pull things out of their ass and make it sound important. You don&#039;t need to analyze behavior itself. That&#039;s symptom analysis, it&#039;s not relevant. What you want to look at are root causes, which are found in biology, which we can then combine with philosophy to extrapolate reasoning based on facts.<br><br>Political sciences are the same as women&#039;s studies. Made up courses to trick dumb kids into paying them large amounts of money to learn nothing useful. It&#039;s as much a science as psychology is. Bunch of subjective interpretabel crap not based on root causes, but on symptom analysis. Neurosciences are much more useful in that aspect.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;women are meant to run a family, in which equality is important between children and there&#039;s a father figure to please who provides<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;women have empathy, which means identifying the children and the predators<\/span><br><br>Is it any wonder that women are natural socialists who are easily tricked into thinking that &quot;needy people&quot; should be imported en masse while their own men are being portrayed as dangerous?","time":1492773972,"resto":122123759,"id":"KspTBNWk","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":122125688,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)07:26:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122123759\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122123759<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;is this shit even legit?<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;is it even a real job?<\/span><br><br>learn what weasel words are","filename":"weasel words","ext":".jpg","w":568,"h":1432,"tn_w":49,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492773978328,"time":1492773978,"md5":"ZJR6qH8PPbN\/cFIDkvBIlg==","fsize":361408,"resto":122123759,"id":"7o8W2bJn","country":"SE","m_img":1,"country_name":"Sweden"}]}

problems mainly because its not realistic about how thing and people currently are. It&#039;s also worth considering that Rand grew up in the Soviet Union and witnesses government oppression first hand and her philosophy is the extreme opposition to collectivism. She also worked her way up from nothing, coloring her views on how others might do the same.<br><br>Her views on what a proper government should do are unrealistic though, to her it was purely to protect its people from harm with very barebones safteynets and services. She hated altruism yet the government is ideally a purely altruistic entity. There&#039;s no point for it being their unless it helps the greatest amount of people. A large government that pools all its money into altruism is why we might have things like universal healthcare and good free education.<br><br>She also had an unrealistic view of what large corporations and businesses tend to do. She couldn&#039;t have predicted the decline of production and the move to financial trickery as a primary means of corporations making money, today every major corporation will fuck you as much as possible while keeping the status quo, unless forced to stop through regulation. Its simply too easy to exploit people when your working through proxies and reduce masses of people to numbers.<br><br>Her views on human nature were unrealistic. She believed we could be hero&#039;s. She once understood to a certain degree(the fountainhead) that not everyone can be an individualist hero and had a certain level of compassion for those unlucky ones but later this attitude essentially turned into contempt for the weak. Large masses of people, pretty much everyone, has deep psychological problems for various reasons, no one can be Howard Roark. perhaps its worth striving towards but Rand was extremely severe and often unrealistic about how people truly are.","time":1493914234,"resto":124058720,"id":"VR7mcbpa","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124074994,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)12:11:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124074720\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124074720<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Common lisp<\/span><br>Pleb tier<br><br>If you really want to watch the universe unravel program in GNU emacs lisp","time":1493914263,"resto":124058720,"id":"h99GdSUC","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124075022,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)12:11:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124074396\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124074396<\/a><br>academic philosphy is all bullshit<br>objectivism replaces it<br>and it right<br>:)","time":1493914279,"resto":124058720,"id":"fJAYwHQ+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124075025,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)12:11:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124074522\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124074522<\/a><br>They are though, because technology keeps getting better and theoretically, just like computers, they can be made cheaper and better every year.

Yes. Even if we do not find a better solution and we have to continue relying on this method, the problem you bring up is not necessarily an issue.<br>We can use your sqrt(2) as an example. If we do not get the actual infinite decimal value of sqrt(2), and only get an approximated value to ten thousand decimal places, you may say that the result is inaccurate. However, if we were to multiply this result by itself, we will still be able to get back the value 2 by approximation. Yes, this is not fully accurate to the infinite-th degree. However, does it need to be? Note that it MAY in fact need to be accurate to the infinite-th degree (I do not know, we are not even currently able to simulate every single molecule of water in a small pool). But right now, as far as we are able to tell, this degree of precision is largely irrelevant. We are still able to simulate things like the flight trajectory of a rocket through space very accurately without the need of all these infinitely accurate numbers.<br>So tl;dr, that level of accuracy is not needed in a general simulation as far as we can tell. If we want to create a perfect simulation, we need to first actually figure out all the laws of the universe and by then we will be probably be able to create infinite energy and these minor things

So there, I just debunked you statement, that you typing this post and me reading it is prove of an objectively observable reality. It took me only 5 seconds of thinking. While I have no basis to prove this doesn&#039;t matter because the whole existence of a second option creates a reason to doubt the first one, regardless of it&#039;s seeming folly. And this time, actually attempt to reply, im serious.","time":1493917020,"resto":124058720,"id":"1+IGtOXQ","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":124079802,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)12:57:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124079165\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124079165<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;he assumes a priori that he is the owner of his experience and that this must be a local phenomenological event<\/span><br>i think he just assumes that thinking (or doubting, questioning, experiencing, or whatever you want to say) is a property\/state of an object and not an object itself<br>seems hard to deny","time":1493917033,"resto":124058720,"id":"NuSNrKBo","country":"DK","country_name":"Denmark"},{"no":124079853,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)12:57:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124079664\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124079664<\/a><br>when quantum computers?<br><br>what if quantum is all busllhit and atomic is jsut newtonian?<br>jew grab of scince fame?<br>they just discovered uranium and plutonium and how to explode it?<br>how about that?<br>you know einstein worked in a patent office right?","time":1493917063,"resto":124058720,"id":"fJAYwHQ+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124079877,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)12:57:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124077786\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124077786<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;really big processing power<\/span><br>any sense of scale within this universe is irrelevant, stop it with that<br><br>Your only argument is that infinitesimals cannot be computed in finite time, to which I reply, don&#039;t base everything on games.<br>Games have no need to compute anything other than frames.<br>When you want to compute complex stuff you stop using concrete values, and can use abstractions instead.<br><br><br>For example:<br>Say you have the random position of a hundred balls.

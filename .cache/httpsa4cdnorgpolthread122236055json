I am so scared for Canada (and by extension, the rest of Western civilization) if he cannot express the views that he makes all so public. He posts all of his lectures, gives everyone the opportunity to evaluate the perspective, and people still want to shut him down? What is the point of free speech if this man cannot speak about psychological realities. He gets invited to Harvard and yet when he comes to some Southern Ontario university , he gets completely shut down. At the moment, it seems like Jordan Peterson might get run out of Canada, fleeing to the welcoming, Rights honouring, Americans. <br><br>I really hope Jordan Peterson stays in Canada though, turns to politics, and begins to catch the zeitgeist of Canadians being sick of this shit. <br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=-1P<wbr>_1mLlJik","filename":"1491888337580","ext":".jpg","w":944,"h":670,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":177,"tim":1492835659382,"time":1492835659,"md5":"\/rOawkLrXOyl1qCIGl0sng==","fsize":49370,"resto":0,"id":"3x8\/v9Op","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"jordan-peterson-shut-down","country_name":"Canada","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

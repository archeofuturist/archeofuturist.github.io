But there is one problem with your idea. Shitskins are not subhuman because of genetics per se. Culture and its most outstanding manifestation, religion, play an important part as well. <br>While many people think they are atheist, they still cling to christian values, albeit unconsciously. If you start adopting islam, the &#039;whites&#039; will inevitably start inbreeding, killing each other needlessly. On top of all, Islam is a religion structured around top down authority. The Imam is traditionally the only one who is suposed to read the koran. Now think long and hard where those imams will come from. There is no way non arabs can adopt it without arabs taking over.","time":1490372823,"resto":118096782,"id":"H7ff\/B3P","country":"CH","country_name":"Switzerland"},{"no":118097677,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)12:28:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Christianity started off as an awful religion promoting very similar shit to islam.<\/span><br>False<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Rebekka was 3 years old when she was married to isaac.<\/span><br>False<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;God was vengeful and mentioned killing unbelievers all the time.<\/span><br>False<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Christianity however, is dying.<\/span><br>False, it&#039;s growing faster than ever<br><br>Stop shilling, Abdul Salam","time":1490372920,"resto":118096782,"id":"od1abfA5","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":118097689,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)12:28:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"sage subversion threads","time":1490372925,"resto":118096782,"id":"wmMOiEe0","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118097798,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)12:29:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118096782\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118096782<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;You&#039;re sperging out thinking this is achmed.

But there is one problem with your idea. Shitskins are not subhuman because of genetics per se. Culture and its most outstanding manifestation, religion, play an important part as well. <br>While many people think they are atheist, they still cling to christian values, albeit unconsciously. If you start adopting islam, the &#039;whites&#039; will inevitably start inbreeding, killing each other needlessly. On top of all, Islam is a religion structured around top down authority. The Imam is traditionally the only one who is suposed to read the koran. Now think long and hard where those imams will come from. There is no way non arabs can adopt it without arabs taking over.","time":1490372823,"resto":118096782,"id":"H7ff\/B3P","country":"CH","country_name":"Switzerland"},{"no":118097677,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)12:28:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Christianity started off as an awful religion promoting very similar shit to islam.<\/span><br>False<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Rebekka was 3 years old when she was married to isaac.<\/span><br>False<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;God was vengeful and mentioned killing unbelievers all the time.<\/span><br>False<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Christianity however, is dying.<\/span><br>False, it&#039;s growing faster than ever<br><br>Stop shilling, Abdul Salam","time":1490372920,"resto":118096782,"id":"od1abfA5","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":118097689,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)12:28:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"sage subversion threads","time":1490372925,"resto":118096782,"id":"wmMOiEe0","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118097798,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)12:29:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118096782\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118096782<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;You&#039;re sperging out thinking this is achmed.

Moreover, the doctrine contains a number of internal contradictions. Of course, the most obvious internal contradiction is how there can be three persons of God in any meaningful sense and yet there be only one God. Below we have compiled a number of other contradictions and problems associated with trinitarianism. This list is not exhaustive but it does give an idea of how much the doctrine deviates from the Bible. <br><br>1. Did Jesus Christ have two fathers? The Father is the Father of the Son (I John 1:3), yet the child born of Mary was conceived by the Holy Ghost (Matthew 1:18, 20; Luke 1:35). Which one is the true father? Some trinitarians say that the Holy Ghost was merely the Father&#039;s agent in conception - a process they compare to artificial insemination! <br>2. How many Spirits are there? God the Father is a Spirit (John 4:24), the Lord Jesus is a Spirit (II Corinthians 3:17), and the Holy Spirit is a Spirit by definition. Yet there is one Spirit (I Corinthians 12:13; Ephesians 4:4). <br><br>3. If Father and Son are co-equal persons, why did Jesus pray to the Father? (Matthew 11:25). Can God pray to God? <br><br>4. Similarly, how can the Son not know as much as the Father? (Matthew 24:36; Mark 13:32). <br><br>5. Similarly, how can the Son not have any power except what the Father gives Him? (John 5:19, 30; 6:38).","time":1490379506,"resto":118096782,"id":"MWff9qn1","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":118109655,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)14:19:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118109363\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118109363<\/a><br><a href=\"#p118109253\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118109253<\/a><br>6. Similarly, what about other verses of Scripture indicating the inequality of the Son and the Father? (John 8:42; 14:28; I Corinthians 11:3). <br><br>7. Did &quot;God the Son&quot; die? The Bible says the Son died (Romans 5:10). If so, can God die? Can part of God die? <br><br>8. How can there be an eternal Son when the Bible speaks of the begotten Son, clearly indicating that the Son had a beginning? (John 3:16; Hebrews 1:5-6). <br><br>9. If the Son is eternal and existed at creation, who was His mother at that time? We know the Son was made of a woman (Galatians 4:4). <br><br>10. Did &quot;God the Son&quot; surrender His omnipresence while on earth? If so, how could he still be God? <br><br>11. If the Son is eternal and immutable (unchangeable), how can the reign of the Son have an ending? (I Corinthians 15:24-28). <br><br>12. If in answer to questions 3 through 11 we say only the human Son of God was limited in knowledge, was limited in power, and died, then how can we speak of &quot;God the Son&quot;? Are there two Sons?","time":1490379575,"resto":118096782,"id":"MWff9qn1","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":118109700,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)14:19:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118109363\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118109363<\/a><br>thx i will do that","filename":"1486909539016","ext":".jpg","w":2048,"h":1363,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1490379599763,"time":1490379599,"md5":"hF4xAo5Wn09vV4eqJaEw2Q==","fsize":745492,"resto":118096782,"id":"wpk6cJ51","country":"FR","m_img":1,"country_name":"France"},{"no":118109772,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)14:20:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118109363\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118109363<\/a><br>13. Whom do we worship and to whom do we pray? Jesus said to worship the Father (John 4:21-24), yet Stephen prayed to Jesus (Acts 7:59-60). <br><br>14. Can there be more than three persons in the Godhead? Certainly the Old Testament does not teach three but emphasizes oneness. If the New Testament adds to the Old Testament message and teaches three persons, then what is to prevent subsequent revelations of additional persons? If we apply trinitarian logic to interpret some verses of Scripture, we could teach a fourth person (Isaiah 48:16; Colossians 1:3; 2:2; I Thessalonians 3:11; James 1:27). Likewise, we could interpret some verses of Scripture to mean six more persons (Revelation 3:1; 5:6). <br><br>15. Are there three Spirits in a Christian&#039;s heart? Father, Jesus, and the Spirit all dwell within a Christian (John 14:17, 23; Romans 8:9; Ephesians 3:14-17). Yet there is one Spirit (I Corinthians 12:13; Ephesians 4:4). <br><br>16.

If Jesus is on the throne, how can He sit on the right hand of God? (Mark 16:19). Does He sit or stand on the right hand of God? (Acts 7:55). Or is He in the Father&#039;s bosom? (John 1:18). <br><br>18. Is Jesus in the Godhead or is the Godhead in Jesus? Colossians 2:9 says the latter. <br><br>19. Given Matthew 28:19, why did the apostles consistently baptize both Jews and Gentiles using the name of Jesus, even to the extent of rebaptism? (Acts 2:38; 8:16; 10:48; 19:5; 22:16; I Corinthians 1:13). <br><br>20. Who raised Jesus from the dead? Did the Father (Ephesians 1:20), or Jesus (John 2:19-21), or the Spirit?

Does the Father know something that the Holy Spirit does not know? If so, how can they be co-equal? Only the Father knows the day and hour of the Second Coming of Christ (Mark 13:32). <br><br>24. Did the trinity make the Old and New covenants? We know the LORD (Jehovah) did (Jeremiah 31:31-34; Hebrews 8:7-13). If Jehovah is a trinity then Father, Son, and Spirit all had to die to make the new covenant effective (Hebrews 9:16-17). <br><br>25.

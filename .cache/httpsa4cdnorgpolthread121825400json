But it did evolve. I&#039;m not offering any argument that liberalism sprang up at a certain point complete, fully matured. Neither can liberalism can be approached -- as some people do -- as a conversation conducted among philosophers over the centuries. Instead, liberalism must be understood, I think, as a political and social doctrine and a movement grounded in the distinctive culture and traceable to specific historical condition. That culture is the west. A Europe that rose in communion with the bishop of Rome. The historical conditions were those of the middle ages.

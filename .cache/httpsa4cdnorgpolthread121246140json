But if I really had to say so, I&#039;d say the collapse of western civilization after 9\/11. Whatever innocence, and good will, drive and common sense we all had went out the window. The CIA won or the &quot;terrorists&quot; if you prefer. They got their wish. Globalism is unstoppable and we will live in a cyberpunk dystopia. God is a sassy black woman. Men=woman, satanic pizza rituals are real, the internet in the final stages of being turned into a streamlined generic cluster of webpages and not a wild west platform for meeting interesting anonymous people and sharing exciting interesting information. The quality of all forms of art, entertainment, and literature dropped. Third world sewer cultures will replace us all. Asians are not as weak as whites and will genocide all invaders, ironically killing all globalists as well. We all become chines,japs, koreans in the future world of the tri asiatic alliance. Sending the remaining asian human race into the stars to colonize the galaxy and earth like planets, forming the chinojaporean galactic republic.

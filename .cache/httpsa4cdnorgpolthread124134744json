It just doesn&#039;t want to go out, reach out, spread out. A Russian priest I talked with haughtily insisted to me they don&#039;t need to do missions because they already stand witness to the truth. There is this strange tendency for intense parochialism among the Orthodox in general. I&#039;ve wondered if it might not be the result of a lack of central authority because many branches of the Orthodox have become so tied with the state and even ethnicity at times. The lack of missionary zeal to me is not only indefensible but bizarrely so in context of Christian teaching. I&#039;m amazed Orthodox laymen are not frustrated out of their mind about it.<br><br>I don&#039;t doubt the existence of the Orthodox has helped the Catholics (and Protestants) to spread the faith nor do I dismiss the Orthodox from the point of view faith in any way. They are certainly Christians with sound overall doctrine (unlike a lot of Protestants), but I see them as more like a cluster of established groups of believers with no desire for universality. They just want to have their faith and their community and that&#039;s it. But the thing is if we&#039;re speaking about the universal church of Christ, how can we look at the Orthodox as the central authority under these circumstances? <br><br>Africa aside from what could be called ancestral Christian lands was converted by Catholics and more recently the Protestant branching off Catholicism. In the meantime the Orthodox were in North Africa all along. Sure, there are reasons why it was the Catholics and Protestants that spread the gospel instead of the Orthodox, but if we&#039;re talking about the universal church, this record does not reflect favorably on the Orthodox church as a central authority. And of course it never was a central authority, it broke away from the central authority.","time":1493948318,"resto":124134744,"id":"Ck+v9Vis","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":124145695,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)21:39:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124141738\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124141738<\/a><br>Who is this bitch again?","time":1493948372,"resto":124134744,"id":"AF95OZAC","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124145712,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)21:39:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124134744\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124134744<\/a><br><a href=\"#p124136188\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124136188<\/a><br>I find it hard to think Christianity shouldn&#039;t be dismantled when I think about how Judaism is literal devil worship and that our elite are sacrificing children to Moloch, and that they&#039;ve been doing this shit since the Old Testament, and that Jesus is literally claiming to be the &quot;messiah&quot; of that shit people and book.","filename":"801bf3e1a1f3710f6084eb93e34e4331","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":400,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":78,"tim":1493948380168,"time":1493948380,"md5":"gBvz4aHzcQ9ghOuT405DMQ==","fsize":138377,"resto":124134744,"id":"zm1FpOwR","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124145807,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)21:40:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124145128\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124145128<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;This verse is about mystery cults in the ancient world<\/span><br>Not really, it&#039;s a lot more general than that.<br><br>It&#039;s about cutting bad habits and influences out of your like.

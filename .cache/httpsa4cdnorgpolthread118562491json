All of that being said, it sounds like there was some stuff going on behind the scenes. It&#039;s weird that she could be so (relatively) successful on theblaze being a firey outspoken feminine voice for conservatism and then turn around and commit career suicide on the view by attacking conservatives (for being hypocrites). Even if she always felt this way but was contractually unable to express it, then why now? I believe that maybe she was in the process of transitioning away from theblaze or had some trouble brewing with execs and decided (perhaps by mistake) that going on the view and saying those things was now acceptable. She was suspended immediately after the interview and was terminated only a few days after so perhaps for theblaze that was just the straw that broke the camel&#039;s back.","time":1490657262,"resto":118562491,"id":"xyV38WlP","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118579055,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)19:29:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118564836\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118564836<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; entirely because she&#039;s a woman?<\/span><br>JUDGIN&#039; THEM JUST BECAUSE OF THEIR SKIN COLOR!

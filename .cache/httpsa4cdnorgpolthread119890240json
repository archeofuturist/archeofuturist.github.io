The rebels are ISIS, Al-Qaeda, Al-Nusra and mercenaries from Saudi Arabia. <br><br>They already tried this exact same operation in 2013 by staging a false flag chemical weapon attack and blaming it on Assad. The mainstream media and the globalists think you&#039;re so stupid that you don&#039;t remember it and that it was exposed. This was another false flag attack, Assad stands nothing to gain by attacking a non military target and he was winning the civil war. The people who benefit from this are the rebels. <br><br>Trump knows all of this, he knows that Assad should stay in power and he knows about the false flags. Even so it would have been unpopular to call the attack what it was, a false flag, so his only option was to do something. The missile strike was effective for many reasons.<br><br>1) This will stop the fake news allegations that he is a Russian agent by attack a Russian Ally.<br>2) Trump is unpredictable, he ran his campaign on being unpredictable and it is one of his strengths.<br>3) This shows Russia and China that America is no longer a passive entity.","filename":"111","ext":".jpg","w":1100,"h":619,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1491542676985,"time":1491542676,"md5":"tkcFCNarI4Ym3sYeJ8EhKg==","fsize":140445,"resto":0,"id":"33k8eGXp","country":"AU","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"syria-reverse-engineered","country_name":"Australia","replies":2,"images":1,"unique_ips":3},{"no":119892852,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)01:41:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"I hope the next batch of tomahawks will mysteriously land on ISIS locations","time":1491543693,"resto":119890240,"id":"acPFOq5i","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":119893012,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)01:42:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119890240\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119890240<\/a>","filename":"austin-petersen-gets-it-wrong","ext":".png","w":705,"h":432,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":76,"tim":1491543763323,"time":1491543763,"md5":"owKoM3NrSCxJkiUjj3CNrQ==","fsize":186209,"resto":119890240,"id":"NPBmyQEj","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

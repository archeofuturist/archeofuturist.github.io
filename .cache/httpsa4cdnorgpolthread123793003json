Some non-mainstream or more obscure genres may yet be uncorrupted. If it&#039;s a niche genre, corrupting or influencing it wouldn&#039;t be worth the time and money. Though there are still good artists and bands in mainstream genres, especially those that haven&#039;t gone through the usual BS process of publishing with a record label, signing a record deal, etc.. If they don&#039;t sign the contract and take the record label&#039;s money to make an album, then they can&#039;t be controlled directly.

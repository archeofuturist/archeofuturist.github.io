They will immediately get confused and proceed to blurt out a concoction of additional Marxist-invented buzzwords. So, how do you fight them? How do you win. Simple... attack them back using the same attacks they use against you. Do this in real-time. This requires almost no effort, resources, time because your attacker is the person doing the accusing. Think it of as Judo where you use your opponents on energy against him. Americans are barely just now learning how to combat Marxist agitators and their pseudo-academics.

This runs in DIRECT opposition to socialist values, everyone getting the same outcome for different levels of effort and skill.

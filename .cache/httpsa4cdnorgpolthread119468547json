They will immediately get confused and proceed to blurt out a concoction of additional Marxist-invented buzzwords. So, how do you fight them? How do you win. Simple... attack them back using the same attacks they use against you. Do this in real-time. This requires almost no effort, resources, time because your attacker is the person doing the accusing.

This was maybe my answer to Tolkien, whom, as much as I admire him, I do quibble with. Lord of the Rings had a very medieval philosophy: that if the king was a good man, the land would prosper. We look at real history and it\u2019s not that simple. Tolkien can say that Aragorn became king and reigned for a hundred years, and he was wise and good. But Tolkien doesn\u2019t ask the question: What was Aragorn\u2019s tax policy? Did he maintain a standing army? What did he do in times of flood and famine? And what about all these orcs? By the end of the war, Sauron is gone but all of the orcs aren\u2019t gone \u2013 they\u2019re in the mountains. Did Aragorn pursue a policy of systematic genocide and kill them? Even the little baby orcs, in their little orc cradles? The war that Tolkien wrote about was a war for the fate of civilization and the future of humanity, and that\u2019s become the template. I\u2019m not sure that it\u2019s a good template, though. The Tolkien model led generations of fantasy writers to produce these endless series of dark lords and their evil minions who are all very ugly and wear black clothes. But the vast majority of wars throughout history are not like that.<\/span>","filename":"1492426082418","ext":".jpg","w":620,"h":413,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":83,"tim":1492599656140,"time":1492599656,"md5":"0zGmGdQqxJHlXGKnxe+bEg==","fsize":31622,"resto":121814360,"id":"HEuaY3Zz","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":121831721,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)07:02:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121825374\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121825374<\/a><br>Without fuckups there would be no story drive,<br>It is hard to write a character without fuckups and not to dive into &quot;Mary sue&quot; territory.","time":1492599769,"resto":121814360,"id":"qt9808RY","country":"LV","country_name":"Latvia"},{"no":121831752,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)07:03:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121831721\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121831721<\/a><br>Daenerys is a mary sue though","time":1492599795,"resto":121814360,"id":"FtFQykdw","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121831805,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)07:04:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121831752\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121831752<\/a><br><br>She is retarded, but not a Mary Sue.","time":1492599846,"resto":121814360,"id":"qt9808RY","country":"LV","country_name":"Latvia"},{"no":121831874,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)07:05:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121817212\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121817212<\/a><br>Underposted rate.","time":1492599912,"resto":121814360,"id":"\/uFFmIlF","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121831991,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)07:06:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121831805\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121831805<\/a><br>Anon.

He doesn&#039;t pursue genocide and instead works to restore the kingdom of Gondor and basically ushers in their renaissance - instead of learning the old Greek and Roman writings they are relearning the superior Numenorian systems and knowledge. This is established to be a 1000% improvement on what the realms of man had become. Just like the men of Dale are uplifted by rekindling their old kingdom.<br><br>Tolkien also implicitly states Aragorn did not want to just claim the title but spent weeks outside the city preparing the recovery of Gondor. He reestablished Gondor&#039;s naval superiority and established far flung trade routes - his reclamation of the Illithen highlands was a tremendous boost to the rural economy all greatly benefiting a previously besieged declining kingdom.<br><br>Martin opinion is what happens when your read the books as a kid and don&#039;t read them again ever then pass off your poor memory as fact.","time":1492605984,"resto":121814360,"id":"SrOBLqc3","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":121840014,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)08:47:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121835292\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121835292<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121835467\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121835467<\/a><br>The best part was that the reaction to the sad puppies proved the point.","time":1492606046,"resto":121814360,"id":"YfKDMeMF","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121840942,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)08:58:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121823689\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121823689<\/a><br>Wait, is Dany a metaphorical criticism of USA foreign policy?<br>Sheeeeeeeiiiiiiit","time":1492606692,"resto":121814360,"id":"9zFFO\/UC","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121841340,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)09:02:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121829774\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121829774<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Red Wedding 2.0<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;not LSH\/BwB<\/span>","filename":"seriously","ext":".png","w":396,"h":381,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":120,"tim":1492606953332,"time":1492606953,"md5":"1Vr0sAKNyM3GHepda77j2w==","fsize":137164,"resto":121814360,"id":"JpuINBKE","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":121841361,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)09:02:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121838129\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121838129<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;ficki ficki.jpg<\/span>","time":1492606965,"resto":121814360,"id":"ftXXFZT3","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121841557,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)09:04:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121839006\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121839006<\/a><br>desu Sam is also a whiny pussy and a coward","time":1492607062,"resto":121814360,"id":"tCr9QKnF","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121841610,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)09:05:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121839472\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121839472<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Olenna<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Margaery<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Asha<\/span>","time":1492607100,"resto":121814360,"id":"tCr9QKnF","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121841765,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)09:06:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121832696\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121832696<\/a><br>He should adopt a few hundred refugees then.

I predicted that, and that the Children of the Forest\u2014who in these stories are usually just the good, nature-loving elves \u2014are actually tricking us all into killing ourselves. There are some other big, fundamental things too\u2014there are no gods and there is *no religion*. And there is no prophecy.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I think that the show is keeping with the major themes\u2014anti-war, *religion*, feminism, feudalism and slavery. But I think without the source material, they\u2019ve been having trouble surprising the audience with twists. They\u2019ve been having trouble with political scheming. I think those are the real faults in the show. They haven\u2019t stepped back and a you know thought about all the motivation and the complexity.&quot;<br><br>&quot;The creator of the series is a huge, enormous hippie\u2014he believes in \u201cmake love not war\u201d and he\u2019s a huge feminist too. Everything that he\u2019s writing about is relevant to politics today.&quot;<br><br>So essentially this guy is a leftist washintonian who is crafting conspiracies about Game of Thrones to fit his narrative, contradicting himself along the way as all leftists usually do, have I got that right?

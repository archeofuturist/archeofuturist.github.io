Even Meryl Streep did a speech at an award show referencing a fake scandal, the idea that Trump made fun of a man&#039;s disability. Most people have not looked into any of these stories in order to learn HOW they were false. <br><br>Problem is that those people on the left that ate up all that blatant biased media, never looked anywhere else for their news so that they could learn that there was a bias. <br><br>Back in the Bush years the Daily Show poked fun at Fox News&#039; bias that was in favor of Bush, but who on television did the same to make fun of the Bias in favor of Obama? Many of us do not watch television and instead engage with alternative news outlets which is why their bias stands out as it does.","time":1492526028,"resto":121687040,"id":"VpwMqbTi","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121690750,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)10:34:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121687040\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121687040<\/a><br><br>Colbert might be a leftist cunt, but he&#039;s a funny leftist cunt","time":1492526047,"resto":121687040,"id":"c2Bs6oTF","country":"BE","country_name":"Belgium"},{"no":121690766,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)10:34:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121690594\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121690594<\/a><br>He is very well spoken and reveals the truth about the neocons including clinton, it is worth the watch","time":1492526057,"resto":121687040,"id":"W\/cN0u02","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":121690817,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)10:34:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121687040\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121687040<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;infowars&#039; not infowar&#039;s<\/span>","time":1492526094,"resto":121687040,"id":"jqWYRXEI","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121690925,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)10:35:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121689126\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121689126<\/a><br>That was the first thing I thought, how low can people get?","time":1492526151,"resto":121687040,"id":"+U6+QBEv","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":121690960,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)10:36:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"SO TRUMP<br>*audience goggles with anticipation*<br>IS A BIG POOPY MAN<br>*audience laughter rumbles*<br>HE&#039;S A BIG FAT DUM DUM<br>*audience sides begin orbiting earth*<br>STINKY DOO DOO<br>*audience dies*","time":1492526174,"resto":121687040,"id":"oIwfr9yH","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121691121,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)10:37:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121687040\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121687040<\/a><br>I don&#039;t see them parodying TYT.

I can understand that different cultures have different approaches to certain aspects of live, but I have yet to witness an American acknowledging that there&#039;s a different norm in Germany in regard to social interaction instead of lamenting how anti social and reserved germans are. It infuriates me especially when people are staying here for long periods and try to impose their norms instead of adapting. As long as you are here for just a moderate amount of time you can dislike the German mindset as much as you want, I would probably not feel well in the USA as well.","time":1491311663,"resto":119464590,"id":"sd4tdjUh","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"}]}

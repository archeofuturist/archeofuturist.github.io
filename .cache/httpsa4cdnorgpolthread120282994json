Isn\u2019t that being opposite of globalism? If globalism shouldn\u2019t all peoples be staying in own countries and America be exporting culture and ideas to them? If cultures, beliefs, and philosophies of Africa, Asia, and India is being so cool and awesome, why isn\u2019t everyone immigrating there? Because its not and they aren\u2019t. European or Western Culture has proven is being best and most dominant, nothing to do with skin colors, white, brown, yellow, but is having to do with being red. No not red communism, red as in blood. European ancestors did the work, the thinking, the rebelling, the fighting, the killing, and the dying. Sometimes they being on rite side of history and sometimes not, but result is being great culture and society. \u201cBut, America is nation of immigrants!\u201d Yes, but until 30 years ago most immigrants being Europeans. Jeudeo-Christian Europeans minor cultural differences. Don\u2019t bring the world to America, bring America to the world. America first. English first. American workers first. American students first. American culture first.<br><br>White Privilege<br>Dear Americans, do you seek black privileged, reparation, and free shit?

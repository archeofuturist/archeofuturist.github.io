It&#039;s very hard to trace back your entire lineage by archival methods, as the numbers add up literally exponentially. If, say, your mother&#039;s father&#039;s father&#039;s mother&#039;s mother&#039;s father&#039;s mother was a jew, you&#039;re already almost 1% jewish. And that&#039;s even ignoring the possibility of adultery\/bastard children (which of course would cause erroneous archival records, as often the father would either not know or just hide it to avoid shame), so the entire line up until that point becomes unclear.

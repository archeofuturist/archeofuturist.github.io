It probably has more in common with the innate spirituality of the white peoples than Christianity, although I prefer the European branch because it is of my people. Catholicism is a kind of weird mix of Judaeo-Christianity, European paganism, and authoritarianism. I&#039;d prefer to just focus on the one white element, and I mean no disrespect to the Catholic defenders of our lands when saying that.","filename":"Lif-and-Lifthrasir","ext":".jpg","w":888,"h":1154,"tn_w":96,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492404127742,"time":1492404127,"md5":"6HCiISnm\/2QBDarzc+ywfw==","fsize":685986,"resto":121479847,"id":"v4pNKIdh","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":121480796,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)00:45:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121479847\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121479847<\/a><br>As an Indian Hindu, I think Hinduism is the best religion because you literally don&#039;t have to do shit.

From the point of view of those who inherit the Muslim culture and religion, it&#039;s really not that bad when you contrast it with what Judaism or Christianity would be for them. I&#039;m pretty sure there are even lines in the text claiming that Arabs are favored or superior people, which is a powerful belief whites used to have when they claimed descent from Odin or Heimdall. I don&#039;t think it&#039;s improper to simultaneously loathe and respect an enemy. Islam has plenty of vices but it&#039;s not without virtue either. <br>To not seem like a hypocrite in my assessment of Christian nationalism as insignificant, I just want to point out that I would say the same for polytheism.","filename":"Thor","ext":".jpg","w":412,"h":535,"tn_w":96,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492404606136,"time":1492404606,"md5":"a3uROyLCvXqdJ+KHH47FZw==","fsize":78030,"resto":121479847,"id":"v4pNKIdh","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121481366,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)00:50:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121480796\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121480796<\/a><br>What is the difference in practice between which god you devote yourself to?

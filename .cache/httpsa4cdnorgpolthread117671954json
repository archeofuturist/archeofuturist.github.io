Now, Springare is getting a platform in the form of a column in newspaper Nyheter Idag to inform Swedes and the outside world of the real situation when it comes to migrant crime in the Scandinavian country.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Sweden\u2019s police force was against Springare from the beginning and along with the government attempted to charge him with \u201cinciting racial hatred\u201d. The charges were later dismissed. Undeterred, the police have now launched an investigation into Springare\u2019s use of police computers saying he \u201chacked\u201d their database to produce figures for an article he wrote.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Despite the resistance, Springare has continued to post on Facebook and even revealed a riot at a school that saw police and journalists attacked earlier this month had been largely perpetrated by young migrant men. Of the 11 participants in the riot, Springare alleged that 10 of them came from migrant backgrounds.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In his newest Facebook post, Springare declared war on \u201cleft extremist journalists\u201d which lawyer M\u00e5rten Schultz said on Saturday could be used against him by his employer. The article spurred Chang Frick of Nyheter Idag to offer Springare a platform from which he could be protected under law as the newspaper, and not him personally, would be responsible for what is published.<\/span><br><br>Is the wheel finally turning to our side?

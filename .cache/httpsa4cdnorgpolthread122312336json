Aside from straight up sending him a link to \/pol\/\u2026 how can I get him to see what&#039;s actually going on, both in his life, and in the world. <br>I was his confirmation sponsor and I feel like I&#039;m letting him down if I don&#039;t help him out.","filename":"1486768365831","ext":".jpg","w":768,"h":1024,"tn_w":187,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492887518903,"time":1492887518,"md5":"6n7N4n50vv\/DZQLsElDacw==","fsize":118837,"resto":0,"id":"bag8JOI6","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"how-can-we-show-our-youth-the-political-light-i","country_name":"Canada","replies":2,"images":1,"unique_ips":3},{"no":122312427,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)14:59:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122312336\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122312336<\/a>","filename":"1492831961397","ext":".jpg","w":250,"h":221,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":110,"tim":1492887573228,"time":1492887573,"md5":"Icx3pOY0glAejPTcdA3p7Q==","fsize":7980,"resto":122312336,"id":"ulaWSsXZ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122312483,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)15:00:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"*BRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA<wbr>AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP<wbr>PPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPFF<wbr>FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFTTTTTTTTT<wbr>TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT<wbr>TTTTTTTT*","time":1492887602,"resto":122312336,"id":"ZIs85Jlb","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

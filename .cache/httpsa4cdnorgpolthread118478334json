Every year afer the first rain, the Newport Beach Wine Society (of which I am a member) gathers at my mansion to watch the island&#039;s natives grovel in the mud as their pathetic straw dwellings are ripped apart by the rising waters. On this island there is also a fish, called a Piranha Giganticus. Coinciding with the first rain, this fish swims into the flooded island and begins to feed on the older and weaker natives of Malderiki. Unable to defend themselves from the killer fish and uttrly helpless, the natives make their way to my mansion in makeshift canoes. At this point, the Newport Beach Wine Society opens a bottle of pre-revolution French Chardonnay, dated no later than 1760, and places wagers on which native will be the first to reach the high ground of my sprawling lawn. Once the fish has fed and returned to the Sea, there are typically a handful of natives left on my lawn, at which point we activate the electric fence and release the crocodiles. Last year, during the crocodile feeding, a tiny speck of native flesh was flung from the lawn up to the balcony where the Newport Beach Wine Society was gathered and landed on my shoe. I retrieved the piece of flesh and placed it in my mouth, washing it down with a glass of Moldovan Pino Griggio. Right now, YOU are that piece of flesh.<\/span>","filename":"1458246761654","ext":".jpg","w":480,"h":360,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1490594399755,"time":1490594399,"md5":"W4O05MvuB8QMkamPwLw0Kw==","fsize":116195,"resto":118478334,"id":"5aDYQQ95","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118479637,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)02:00:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Have you ever drank a glass of black rhinoceros blood? Of course not, I was just being colloquial to start this story with an anecdote. The first time I had a glass I was in South Africa, taking a celebratory drink in Johannesburg after completing a successful hunt. You see, in South Africa they don&#039;t hunt lion, or elephant. We hunted a more dangerous game: the kaffir, or black man. I finally had a 7 year old boy cornered in an Oingo Bongo merchandise warehouse when the thoughts passed through my mind: Should I pull the trigger? Can I ever come back to who I was before this moment? I pulled the trigger, made my first 100 million dollars. Mr. Johnson, this is something you need to ask yourself: Can I pull the trigger on this deal and make the right choice? My offer is 10% funding for 85% ownership of your company and prima nocte rights to your daughters.<\/span>","filename":"1","ext":".png","w":506,"h":454,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":112,"tim":1490594455322,"time":1490594455,"md5":"SmA\/G2XtrVEPUdMPFv\/xwQ==","fsize":227287,"resto":118478334,"id":"5aDYQQ95","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118479697,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)02:01:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;As a young child I saw my Mother relentlessly beaten by my Father. I can still recall hearing her muffled screams through the walls of my bedroom as I lay trying to fall asleep. Some nights were worse than others, but I can recall the mornings my Grandmother would take me to school because my Mother couldn\u2019t be seen in public. She would wear sunglasses and long sleeve shirts for weeks while the bruising and swelling slowly healed around her eyes and arms. I never understood how something as simple as an overcooked meal or dropped glass of wine in the living room could send my father into these inexplicable fits of rage; not until this very moment. Not until I saw your presentation. You are the stain on my fathers rug and I see no club soda nor salt to scrub you away. For an investment of 250,000 dollars I will retain 92% of your company with a lifetime of royalties and if you even for a second glance in Lori\u2019s direction, I will personally crucify each of your children.<\/span>","filename":"2","ext":".png","w":446,"h":454,"tn_w":122,"tn_h":124,"tim":1490594493677,"time":1490594493,"md5":"eoq\/vWalD3Rp4omg8FE9Ag==","fsize":182263,"resto":118478334,"id":"5aDYQQ95","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118479984,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)02:04:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"I&#039;m too principled of a voter, I don&#039;t like the strategic game.

It follows that to be of a minority demographic, say to be a European living in China, means for my features to be perceived among Chinese people, as a variation from the familiar image for what is to be a human.<br><br>Where intersectional feminism is especially retarded, is in seeing this as a bias. As a pathology. When majority demographics happen to constitute the familiar basis of certain categories, it is something they think is correct in shaming. You can not &quot;unlearn bias&quot;, as perception is always already based on familiar consistencies at the expense of variation. <br><br>If you happen to be of a minority demographic, you are going to just have to deal with being a variation among many norms. This isn&#039;t class oppression, for which through revolution you can &quot;dismantle privilege&quot;, achieving a utopia without majorities. Majorities can only give way to other majorities.<br><br>When for example you witness the accusation of white privilege, this effectively is the command to feel shame for happening to be of a majority demographic. To feel shame for being associated with what happens to be familiar for most people.","filename":"quote-white-privilege-is-the-unquestioned-and-unearned-set-of-advantages-entitlements-benefits-peggy-mcintosh-85-82-05","ext":".jpg","w":850,"h":400,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":117,"tim":1491249593392,"time":1491249593,"md5":"bdAPr9RYhx4xOKsbjeNgpA==","fsize":75014,"resto":0,"id":"PvdnNTLG","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"privilege-theory-as-the-resentment-and","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

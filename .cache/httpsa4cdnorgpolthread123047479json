The classic stereotypical view of orphans is that they are emotionally scarred, depressed and misunderstood. This girl however is off the fucking handle.<br><br>She hates her adopted parents and still loves her biological parents even though they abandoned her. She argues that by abandoning her, she was given a worse sentence by living and having to deal with this void of not knowing them and forever living with the shame of being an orphan and being perceived differently. She argues death is a more suitable option.<br><br>Let me paint a scenario. Someone says &quot;wow! Aren&#039;t you so lucky yo have generous foster parents and live in a first world country? (she&#039;s Chinese by the way). Then she will proceed to get mad at that perception that since she is an orphan she is expected to feel grateful and thankful for what is perceived a good life.<br><br>The part that strikes me the most is she does not feel depressed, more angry. Angry that her real parents left even though she&#039;s never seen them. Angry that she&#039;s automatically supposed to feel grateful for living and the perceptions with it. Angry that she is a woman as in Chinese culture, a woman is still seen as a disadvantage. In her mind, having to deal with these constant factors is worse than death. Everyday she is on a non stop rage.<br><br>&quot;Why don&#039;t you kill yourself then?&quot; I say if all this enraging you. She gives me a very somber answer that simply being human gives her the drive to survive. Well \/pol\/? Are some things worse than death? If you&#039;re a Christian, you goddamn well know dying godless is the end of the world to you. You fear death without god. But for others, to them it&#039;s a break.","filename":"1484821130210 (2017_01_22 01_23_32 UTC)","ext":".jpg","w":400,"h":267,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1493306934149,"time":1493306934,"md5":"QyGlFT31ODCbKO2j2hzgMg==","fsize":74090,"resto":0,"id":"CVkdlWkp","country":"NZ","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"is-there-a-worse-experience-than-death","country_name":"New Zealand","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

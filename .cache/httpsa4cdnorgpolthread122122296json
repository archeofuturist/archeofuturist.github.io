Hating sin yes, that&#039;s what repentance is all about, but hating people? No. You would really have to deliberately ignore most of the Bible and cherry pick some verses out of context while playing word games, to justify your sinful hateful heart, rather than allowing God to correct it.<br><br>Don&#039;t compare your hate to God&#039;s hate, what God has is a holy and pure hatred towards sin and darkness, that&#039;s why the wages of sin is death and we all don&#039;t deserve to be in his presence, and that is what Christ fixed.<br><br>Your hate is selfish, self-centered, and evil. Please don&#039;t play word games, you know very well how much God wants us to love all, including our enemies, and to pray for those who persecute us, and not to take revenge because vengeance is for the Lord. Don&#039;t play word games with God&#039;s word, for as you know, God is not mocked, and we will be judged for every careless word we speak!<br><br>&quot;Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love.&quot;<br>(1 John 4:8)<br><br>&quot;The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked: who can know it?&quot;<br>(Jeremiah 17:9)","time":1492778582,"resto":122122296,"id":"0iS2YtH9","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":122131541,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)08:43:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122131298\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122131298<\/a><br><a href=\"#p122131371\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122131371<\/a><br>what if I told you the ultimate form of larping is the state<br>you don&#039;t even need gay costumes for thatall you need is people without religion looking for a replacement","time":1492778619,"resto":122122296,"id":"are6t59H","country":"AT","country_name":"Austria"},{"no":122131596,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)08:44:17","name":"Anonymous","filename":"8a94385175a100a810f216d57c61d24c","ext":".jpg","w":564,"h":437,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":96,"tim":1492778657440,"time":1492778657,"md5":"kuw9DgbApcH4r2bQ74qXGQ==","fsize":53772,"resto":122122296,"id":"unNmkBDV","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122131606,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)08:44:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122122296\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122122296<\/a><br><a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/122130986#p122130986\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122130986<\/a><br>Question to americans","time":1492778670,"resto":122122296,"id":"SBN2Wd70","country":"LV","country_name":"Latvia"},{"no":122131934,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)08:48:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122131007\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122131007<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;false witness<\/span>","time":1492778921,"resto":122122296,"id":"2eu4qG\/B","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122131988,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)08:49:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122131485\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122131485<\/a><br>Pic related<br><br><a href=\"#p122131182\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122131182<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Paul<\/span><br>No thanks","filename":"this","ext":".gif","w":300,"h":186,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":77,"tim":1492778960077,"time":1492778960,"md5":"2QvEWltH00xEmwRTt0hTHg==","fsize":456666,"resto":122122296,"id":"mHBV+S9C","country":"BE","country_name":"Belgium"},{"no":122132057,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)08:50:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122131064\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122131064<\/a><br>A lot of these stemmed from early Christian practice if you take the time to read","time":1492779013,"resto":122122296,"id":"2eu4qG\/B","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122132271,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)08:52:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122131182\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122131182<\/a><br>I have read it, and will always read it again, but thanks for the reminder I guess :p<br><br><a href=\"#p122131988\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122131988<\/a><br>Hey man, Paul is great, it&#039;s just that people are sinful.<br><br>The same reason we have Mormons is the same reason we have people claiming things like we should be hating Jews, or that Jesus isn&#039;t really God but some sort of ascended master.

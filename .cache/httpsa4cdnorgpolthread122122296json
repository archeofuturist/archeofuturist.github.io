Hating sin yes, that&#039;s what repentance is all about, but hating people? No. You would really have to deliberately ignore most of the Bible and cherry pick some verses out of context while playing word games, to justify your sinful hateful heart, rather than allowing God to correct it.<br><br>Don&#039;t compare your hate to God&#039;s hate, what God has is a holy and pure hatred towards sin and darkness, that&#039;s why the wages of sin is death and we all don&#039;t deserve to be in his presence, and that is what Christ fixed.<br><br>Your hate is selfish, self-centered, and evil. Please don&#039;t play word games, you know very well how much God wants us to love all, including our enemies, and to pray for those who persecute us, and not to take revenge because vengeance is for the Lord. Don&#039;t play word games with God&#039;s word, for as you know, God is not mocked, and we will be judged for every careless word we speak!<br><br>&quot;Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love.&quot;<br>(1 John 4:8)<br><br>&quot;The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked: who can know it?&quot;<br>(Jeremiah 17:9)","time":1492778582,"resto":122122296,"id":"0iS2YtH9","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":122131541,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)08:43:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122131298\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122131298<\/a><br><a href=\"#p122131371\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122131371<\/a><br>what if I told you the ultimate form of larping is the state<br>you don&#039;t even need gay costumes for thatall you need is people without religion looking for a replacement","time":1492778619,"resto":122122296,"id":"are6t59H","country":"AT","country_name":"Austria"},{"no":122131596,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)08:44:17","name":"Anonymous","filename":"8a94385175a100a810f216d57c61d24c","ext":".jpg","w":564,"h":437,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":96,"tim":1492778657440,"time":1492778657,"md5":"kuw9DgbApcH4r2bQ74qXGQ==","fsize":53772,"resto":122122296,"id":"unNmkBDV","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122131606,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)08:44:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122122296\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122122296<\/a><br><a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/122130986#p122130986\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122130986<\/a><br>Question to americans","time":1492778670,"resto":122122296,"id":"SBN2Wd70","country":"LV","country_name":"Latvia"},{"no":122131934,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)08:48:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122131007\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122131007<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;false witness<\/span>","time":1492778921,"resto":122122296,"id":"2eu4qG\/B","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122131988,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)08:49:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122131485\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122131485<\/a><br>Pic related<br><br><a href=\"#p122131182\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122131182<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Paul<\/span><br>No thanks","filename":"this","ext":".gif","w":300,"h":186,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":77,"tim":1492778960077,"time":1492778960,"md5":"2QvEWltH00xEmwRTt0hTHg==","fsize":456666,"resto":122122296,"id":"mHBV+S9C","country":"BE","country_name":"Belgium"},{"no":122132057,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)08:50:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122131064\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122131064<\/a><br>A lot of these stemmed from early Christian practice if you take the time to read","time":1492779013,"resto":122122296,"id":"2eu4qG\/B","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122132271,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)08:52:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122131182\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122131182<\/a><br>I have read it, and will always read it again, but thanks for the reminder I guess :p<br><br><a href=\"#p122131988\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122131988<\/a><br>Hey man, Paul is great, it&#039;s just that people are sinful.<br><br>The same reason we have Mormons is the same reason we have people claiming things like we should be hating Jews, or that Jesus isn&#039;t really God but some sort of ascended master.

He was a mere man.

I don&#039;t remember if he was influenced by the platonic ideas that well all the range but could be. Hypathia lived a bit later, during the christianisation and she was a platonist. The hatred of the body and her entire rant at &quot;how can you like something that bleeds out of their snatch&quot; towards someone who loved her is typical for platonists who hated the body and only looked to the immaterial realm of ideas as good.<br><br>Other example.<br>On one hand, we now know that the love between man and woman is an expression, although imperfect, of the love of God. There&#039;s no more beautiful thing than the creation of another life through two people that love each other. Then comes Paul who says that the best thing you can do is to love someone from afar and never desecrate them by not putting your peen in their vagina, but if you can&#039;t help yourself well at least get married. <br><br>With Paul you reintroduce a hatred of the physical, of the body. Whereas, if such a hatred had any place at all, it contradicts the purpose of Jesus incarnating as a child, getting born, growing up and his physical body dying. There&#039;s something very powerful in the message that God&#039;s son took on the flesh.

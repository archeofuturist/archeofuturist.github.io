Seems to have lost everything, cucked by the love of his life and claims he went to tell his mother he was suicidal and feeling like killing people and she didn&#039;t give a fuck. Just another low IQ nigga, terrible parenting and with nothing left to lose it seems. Quite possibly legit mental as well. Its all really fucking sad.<br><br>I still hope the cops put a bullet in him.

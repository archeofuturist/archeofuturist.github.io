Both reddit and the_donald are cancer. The problem is after they left, the_donald became aware of the shilling and now wants to &quot;help&quot; by calling out any criticism of reddit or Trump shilling. Being anti-reddit now is evidence of shilling and that&#039;s the real problem. Furthermore, calling out Kushner is considered evidence of shilling to them. I would not be surprised at all if they flipped in roles as well, notice how the usage of &quot;t_d&quot; has lowered in the last few days.","filename":"1491700445218","ext":".jpg","w":992,"h":900,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":113,"tim":1491822532189,"time":1491822532,"md5":"8ankSGSHzVNL9Hwj7K1Gow==","fsize":321167,"resto":120424223,"id":"cP6rgu12","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120425948,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)07:11:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120425732\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120425732<\/a><br>purity tests are a beautiful thing to watch","time":1491822690,"resto":120424223,"id":"ciYicTQX","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":120426332,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)07:16:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120424223\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120424223<\/a><br>HiLIARy Clinton,Merkel,and Chuck Schumer praised him for the bombing so yeah he kinda fucked up.","time":1491822968,"resto":120424223,"id":"oQS7IXQj","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120426564,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)07:18:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120424223\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120424223<\/a><br>The board is undergoing it&#039;s largest raid possibly ever.<br><br>No we did not all turn on Donald.

Erdogan knows he lost his Syrian conquest with the loss of the FSA.<br>He just invaded Syria to divide the kurds in the East and West so he can be a player in this and remain neutral to see which side gives him a better deal : the US or Syria\/Russia\/Iran\/Iraq. Him winning the referendum gives him total control to decide with EU pressure. I hope Assad can make a deal with him.","time":1492360523,"resto":121369216,"id":"d2Qui8ba","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121378228,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)12:37:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121377564\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121377564<\/a><br>I&#039;d let those liberator qts at 0:50 liberate me any time anywhere","filename":"1480447079462","ext":".jpg","w":617,"h":799,"tn_w":96,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492360629103,"time":1492360629,"md5":"lM\/omoRPSZauGS9cRV7Dng==","fsize":69072,"resto":121369216,"id":"jDC28ty\/","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":121378268,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)12:37:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121378002\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121378002<\/a><br>you&#039;re implying that erdomeme thinks like a rational person famalamadingdong","filename":"1483883561445","ext":".png","w":500,"h":500,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492360647257,"time":1492360647,"md5":"sVE7JyUBSr4O+ifzLhUJ\/A==","fsize":56060,"resto":121369216,"id":"SvLCOmsl","country":"BE","country_name":"Belgium"},{"no":121378310,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)12:37:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"REEEEEEEEE <br><br>I HAD ENOUGH OF THE MSM <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Rebels kill 70 children <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;nobody gives a fuck because the dindu nuffin<\/span>","filename":"alex2","ext":".jpg","w":768,"h":783,"tn_w":122,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492360669095,"time":1492360669,"md5":"EvxIyRcJxEo1HBnwnNUxBw==","fsize":132233,"resto":121369216,"id":"Rb1r3PoW","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":121378367,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)12:38:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121377668\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121377668<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; SDF is not a threat for government at this moment<\/span><br><br>SDF are a bigger threat right now with the FSA ruined.

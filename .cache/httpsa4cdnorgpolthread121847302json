Any place with offshore institutions should be considered as such. But it would be mistake to attack them individually. They are interconnected like P2P network borrowing lots of ideas and effects from physics and quantum theory of relativity, etc to ensure safety and security. So think of entire offshoring network as interconnected communicating vessels holding liquid assets. If you try something with one of them - CIA homos will lift it up for you so you could examine it better. Obviously right away liquid will flow into other lower situated scattered castles. Like candy from the baby. Shit martini stirrers are not exactly worried about money in globalized world with implemented sharia economy system of &quot;deficits don&#039;t matter&quot;. They have unlimited budgets if it&#039;s a global WAR-ming attrition warfare. There is no stopping rule.","time":1492611830,"resto":121847302,"id":"7Np98Dhj","country":"LT","country_name":"Lithuania"}]}

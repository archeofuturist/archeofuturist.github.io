class=\"quote\">&gt;RIGHT, WELL THANKS VERY MUCH!<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;NOW, I&#039;D LIKE TO TALK IN THIS SPEECH ABOUT A CERTAIN THREAD FOUND ON THIS WEBSITE CALLED 4CHAN KNOWN AS BRITPOL. BRITPOL IS THIS SORT OF AMALGAMATION OF PRIMARILY YOUNG BRITISH MEN IN THEIR LATE TEENS AND EARLY 20s WHO HAVE BEEN DISAFFECTED BY MODERNITY AND THE SORT OF 9-5 GRIND THAT IS OFFERED IN CONTEMPORARY POST-MODERN SOCIETY. THEY HAVE A TERM FOR PEOPLE WHO PARTICIPATE IN THE MODERN WORKPLACE, THEY CALL THEM WAGEKEKS AND SOME POSTERS ON THE THREADS WEAR THEIR REJECTION OF SO-CALLED WAGE KEKERY AS A KIND OF BADGE OF HONOUR. BRITPOL HAS A NUMBER OF HOUSEHOLD NAMES, NAMELY BOMBER RIMMER, DESIGNATED LEFTIST, PREUSSE, MEME MERCHANT AND THE TRAGIC CASE OF A CERTAIN WELSH POSTER CALLED YKTD WHO WAS CHASED OUT BY WHAT HE CALLS &quot;ANONYMONGS&quot; FOR RATHER TRIVIAL REASONS THAT WE WON&#039;T GO INTO IN THIS TALK. YKTD WAS A STRANGE PERSON. YKTD WAS THE SORT OF WHIP WHO WITH HIS QUASI-AUTISTIC, IF YOU LIKE, COMMITMENT TO THE THREADS, KEPT THE DISCUSSION IN LINE AND ON TOPIC. HE WAS A CONTROVERSIAL FIGURE BUT HIS ABSENCE HAS LEFT A YEARNING, A SORT OF METAPHYSICAL VOID WHICH OTHER MORE SUPERFICIAL TRIPLORDS HAVE TRIED TO FILL BUT NONE ARE ALL THAT SUCCESSFUL. IN MY PHILOSOPHY, YKTD TRIED TO GO THROUGH THIS PROCESS OF OVER-BECOMING, SORT OF, REJECTING THE MEDIOCRITY OF THE MAYFLIES AND THE ANONYMONGS AND INTO THRUSTING HIMSELF INTO A TRANSCENDENTAL STATE.

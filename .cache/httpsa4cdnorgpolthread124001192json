I want to see how bad Ivy League and all colleges are in general so I was wondering if \/pol\/ could help. I want to create a fake social media campaign to change UPenn&#039;s mascot because of the &quot;evil nature of the Quakers&quot; and how it is &quot;offensive to atheist or other religions&quot; at that school. Similar thing that could be done is John Harvard the pilgrim is a racist symbol because he participated in exterminating the Native Americans. I always wanted to see if some bullcrap like that could happen and experiencing high school and college level knowledge of politics and history I guarantee this could happen, but only if 4chan helps create some professional campaigns like iPhone massacre. \/pol\/ want to help?","filename":"quaker_oats_are_evil_by_tuftedpuffin","ext":".jpg","w":800,"h":909,"tn_w":220,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493863126598,"time":1493863126,"md5":"bI6pRj+PJAE5jdzD3vNIrg==","fsize":64144,"resto":0,"id":"qNUB5OvS","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"upenn-controversy","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":124001629,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)22:02:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124001192\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124001192<\/a><br>i feel like it&#039;s unnecessary attention.

He has a particular and insightful way or looking at things that I often agree with. His blind spots as a leftist are as strong as anyone&#039;s, but they are small and in more out of the way corners.<br><br>http:\/\/archive.is\/MgbiE<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The second narrative [Russian Intervention] is so ludicrous that it\u2019s hard to argue against, as it bases itself on a purely propagandistic worldview. It\u2019s shocking that this tangle of conspiracy theories, racism, and outright invention has survived the decades since the end of the Cold War intact to this degree, although its function as a distraction from internal political crises and systemic economic crises is sadly entirely predictable. That representatives of liberalism in the media and politics can seriously portray Russia\u2014a regional power at best, with vanishingly little industrial or military power compared to the United States\u2014as some sort of cartoonish nation of moustache-swirling spies, and Vladimir Putin (a deeply conservative ruler with strong autocratic tendencies, like so many others) as some sort of Machiavellian evil genius speaks to a profound desperation.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;blames the nebulous category of \u201cwhite men\u201d (generally taken to refer to the non-coastal poor) for Trump\u2019s victory.

Good summary though. Even &quot;equality&quot; feminism is damaging because it requires us to pretend that men and women have equal physical and mental capabilities, which they objectively do not. Men and women have complimentary capabilities. In the eyes of nature, birth and the successful raising of children is second only to feeding in importance, if even that. Feminism trains women to spit on the function for which evolution has prepared them since the beginning of life on Earth. A lifestyle which rejects nature entirely will result in psychological and but logical dysfunction on the individual level, and social decay at the group level.","time":1492194673,"resto":121091830,"id":"qfmDjmkC","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121094213,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)14:31:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"A<br><br>FUCKING<br><br>LEAF","time":1492194700,"resto":121091830,"id":"xylmtkjk","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121094264,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)14:32:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121091830\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121091830<\/a><br>Well, we are mostly straight white males.","time":1492194729,"resto":121091830,"id":"TSViTXsN","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":121094291,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)14:32:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121091830\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121091830<\/a><br>Feminists bitch about their life is in the west while there are sex slaves ,child slaves and rapes in the middle east .

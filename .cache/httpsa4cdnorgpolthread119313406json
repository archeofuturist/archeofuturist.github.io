I&#039;ve been sitting here staring at the ceiling fan all day. I&#039;m just waiting for my mission. Regular army special forces here, trained in hand to hand combat by Bruce Lee books, nothing going on though. I don&#039;t have a life, I&#039;m an empty shell. Sometimes there&#039;s filling of my mind, so that I develop a personality. I think it&#039;s my personality but I can act anyway I want. But my true identiy is Spec Ops, I&#039;m just waiting for my mission. Just following orders. I wake up everyday, still in my mom&#039;s apartment, shit. She even wants me to stop drinking alcohol, no woman makes me do anything, not even mom, I&#039;m eating her food but once I get some alcohol I&#039;m going to fuck my life up because I just know one of these days I&#039;ll get my mission. Now I am taking ibuprofen, that helps with alcohol withdrawal. Got to save my money and buy a chicken farm, live on eggs and maybe sell some to pay for electricity and water bills. Going to need a lot of chickens and a lot of eggs. I know what&#039;s best for me, to go live on a chicken farm, maybe with cows and all that. Soon you&#039;ll be getting the best steaks from anon, I can&#039;t do anything but I bet I can do the basics, like farming. Trouble is, a storm might come and kill all my chickens and that would fuck me up good. I like to keep things nice and simple, so I just wait day to day for my mission.","time":1491215730,"resto":119313406,"id":"PeMeBPKt","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119314719,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)06:36:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119313627\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119313627<\/a><br>i wish <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;also sage this thread<\/span>","filename":"1423511440982-2","ext":".jpg","w":1133,"h":790,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":87,"tim":1491215802674,"time":1491215802,"md5":"iW4qoIkX5sJZRWXdNIxfqw==","fsize":130917,"resto":119313406,"id":"t7JUOxxh","country":"AU","m_img":1,"country_name":"Australia"},{"no":119314748,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)06:37:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119313406\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119313406<\/a><br>I thought it was an April Fools prank<br>guess it&#039;s not","time":1491215827,"resto":119313406,"id":"9\/3ehIuj","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119314941,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)06:40:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119314651\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119314651<\/a><br>Godspeed anon","time":1491216001,"resto":119313406,"id":"MVRuW9gK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119315068,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)06:42:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119313406\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119313406<\/a><br>8pol went down a year ago? wow, slow news day","time":1491216147,"resto":119313406,"id":"B1+bLtgs","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":119317822,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)07:28:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119313676\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119313676<\/a><br><a href=\"#p119314719\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119314719<\/a><br>Fugg you leafs are right, can&#039;t post on 8pol currently, shit&#039;s pretty bad..","time":1491218917,"resto":119313406,"id":"Za8y8pfs","country":"EE","country_name":"Estonia"}]}

Determining if sarin (or almost any other organophosphonate for that matter) was used is realtively easy by checking for breakdown (or metabolized if you have blood\/tissue samples) products, as well as things like stabilizing agents, common impurifications or byproducts of synthesis. Trying to determine if the agents used in different incidents are from the same stock is a lot harder, especially when you&#039;re dealing with old, not properly collected and stored samples.<br><br>Check the UN report on the 2013 incidents.

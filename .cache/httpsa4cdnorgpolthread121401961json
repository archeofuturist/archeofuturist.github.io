This is in the very centre of the city. Its shelves and counters were groaning with locally produced goods, piled into impressive pyramids or in fan-like displays, perfectly arranged, throughout the several floors of the building. On the ground floor was a wide variety of tinned foods, hardware and alcoholic drinks, including a strong Korean liqueur with a whole snake pickled or marinated in the bottle, presumably as an aphrodisiac. Everything glittered with perfection, the tidiness was remarkable.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;It didn\u2019t take long to discover that this was no ordinary department store. It was filled with thousands of people, going up and down the escalators, standing at the corners, going in and out of the front entrance in a constant stream both ways \u2013 yet nothing was being bought or sold. I checked this by standing at the entrance for half an hour. The people coming out were carrying no more than the people entering. Their shopping bags contained as much, or as little, when they left as when they entered. In some cases, I recognised people coming out as those who had gone in a few minutes before, only to see them re-entering the store almost immediately. And I watched a hardware counter for fifteen minutes. There were perhaps twenty people standing at it; there were two assistants behind the counter, but they paid no attention to the \u2018customers\u2019.

They began to shuffle their feet and wriggle, as if my regard pinned them like live insects to a board. The assistants too became restless and began to wonder what to do in these unforeseen circumstances. They decided that there was nothing for it but to distribute something under the eyes of this inquisitive foreigner. And so, all of a sudden, they started to hand out plastic wash bowls to the twenty \u2018customers\u2019, who took them (without any pretence of payment). Was it their good luck, then? Had they received something for nothing? No, their problems had just begun. What were they to do with their plastic washbowls?

I would have taken a photograph, but I remembered just in time that these people were not participating in this charade from choice, that they were victims, and that \u2013 despite their expressionless faces and lack of animation \u2013 they were men with chajusong, that is to say creativity and consciousness, and to have photographed them would only have added to their degradation. I left the hardware counter, but returned briefly a little later: the same people were standing at it, sans brown plastic bowls, which were neatly re-piled on the shelf.<\/span>","time":1492396383,"resto":121401961,"id":"Xqz8O\/Vo","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":121465419,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)22:33:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121453149\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121453149<\/a><br>SUCC","time":1492396384,"resto":121401961,"id":"+W2iCRZG","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":121465457,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)22:33:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121464824\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121464824<\/a><br>I have several questions<br><br>What do you do for a job?<br><br>How did you learn all this stuff?<br><br>Are you a Polynesian shitskin or white?<br><br>Did you guys also get rekt by the recent hurricane or was it only us?","time":1492396399,"resto":121401961,"id":"41C2Nrup","country":"NZ","country_name":"New Zealand"},{"no":121465613,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)22:34:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121452960\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121452960<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Clearance 14&#039;6&quot;<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;FRENCH polynesia <\/span><br>shouldn&#039;t you be useing metric?","time":1492396464,"resto":121401961,"id":"AfcG\/xZC","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121465628,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)22:34:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121465417\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121465417<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I also followed a few people around at random, as discreetly as I could.

Many of them walked away somewhat bemused, examining the rouge uncomprehendingly. At another counter I saw a similar queue receiving a pair of socks, all brown like the plastic bowls.

Such an admission of the obvious would not have been in any way remarkable were it not that socialists so frequently deny it, criticising liberal capitalist democracy because of its wastefulness and its inculcation of artificial desires in its citizens, thereby obscuring their \u2018true\u2019 interests. By stocking Department Store Number 1 with as many goods as they could find, in order to impress foreign visitors, the North Koreans admitted that material plenty was morally preferable to shortage, and that scarcity was not a sign of abstemious virtue; rather it was proof of economic inefficiency. Choice, even in small matters, gives meaning to life. However well fed, however comfortable modern man might be without it, he demands choice as a right, not because it is economically superior, but as an end in itself. By pretending to offer it, the North Koreans acknowledged as much; and in doing so, recognised that they were consciously committed to the denial of what everyone wants.<\/span>","time":1492396678,"resto":121401961,"id":"Xqz8O\/Vo","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":121466180,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)22:38:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121444045\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121444045<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121445056\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121445056<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121445354\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121445354<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121447905\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121447905<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121450521\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121450521<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121450842\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121450842<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121450896\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121450896<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121450935\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121450935<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121452393\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121452393<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121452496\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121452496<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121452891\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121452891<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121453042\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121453042<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121453149\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121453149<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121453349\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121453349<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121453467\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121453467<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121454208\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121454208<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121454352\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121454352<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121455972\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121455972<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121459069\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121459069<\/a><br>I have never before seen such extremely obvious shilling, holy shit<br><br>was this guy killed for failing to convince us?","time":1492396735,"resto":121401961,"id":"41C2Nrup","country":"NZ","country_name":"New Zealand"},{"no":121466326,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)22:40:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121405426\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121405426<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Libraries are huge, but empty, with decade old censored books in poor shape, mostly propaganda.<\/span><br> <br>Inner city library in America","time":1492396805,"resto":121401961,"id":"ebiaMUV8","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121466346,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)22:40:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121466060\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121466060<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;But the most sombre reflection occasioned by Department Store Number 1 is that concerning the nature of the power that can command thousands of citizens to take part in a huge and deceitful performance, not once but day after day, without any of the performers ever indicating by even the faintest sign that he is aware of its deceitfulness, though it is impossible that he should not be aware of it.

But to bribe generals and high end admins, you need stuff from outside you can&#039;t produce. So you need dollars and euros.<br><br>To get them, the Kims sell gold (through macao) and coal to china. They sell rocket tech to arabic countries, like Iran. They send slave workers in Siberia for harvesting wood in forests.

Like in Poland, they used NK slave workers that earned no money (it&#039;s paid to NK and they are told they will get the money when they go back). They work over 12 hours a day, every day, and are kinda jailed in hidden houses that they never leave outside for work. No vacations, no week ends.<br><br>The succession was not easy, and Kim Jong Un had to be pretty harsh to stay alive and keep his hand on power. Thus the military spending and nuke tests. The problem is that the whole nukes and rocket shenanigan infuriated worst korea, japan and USA, and even threatened a little china.

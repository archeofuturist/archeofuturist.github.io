I had planned to visit NK while I was doing a round the world trip because I&#039;m also interested in authoritarian governments, but China only gave me a single entry visa. I went to Myanmar instead. It was a lot cheaper and I expect Myanmar will change a lot now that they&#039;ve opened up again, but I&#039;m worried that I won&#039;t have the chance to go to NK before the system ends, one way or another.<br><br>It sounds like your tour was very much on rails with little opportunity to venture out of the boundaries they place upon you.

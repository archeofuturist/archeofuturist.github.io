So you should always have an open enough mind to accept that the truth is probably somewhere in between.<br><br>Look at what happened with Hillary. Conservatives said she was guilty as sin and should be in jail, liberals said she did nothing wrong, the ultimate consequence was a reprimand and the embarrassment of losing the election to Donald Trump.<br><br>Under this same logic, it&#039;s safe to conclude that there is SOME KIND of collusion going on with SOMEONE in the Trump campaign and Russia. There&#039;s enough evidence already to show that people like Flynn, Page, and Manafort are all caught up in their own separate scandals, which all loosely orbit the Russia scandal. <br><br>This does not however mean that Trump and Pence are directly involved. Even if they WERE directly involved, the likelihood of there being any actual provable evidence is slim, because that&#039;s the entire point of having lackies like these guys, to give you plausible deniability.<br><br>Chris Christie is another example. Bridgegate was kind of a big deal and I think anyone can accept that Christie very likely was involved with it, but his cronies took the fall and he walked away unscathed. He even got re-elected during it. Nobody cared, even though he may in fact be a criminal.<br><br>I think it&#039;ll be the same with Trump. Someone will go to jail, someone will get reprimanded, someone else will likely be fired before it&#039;s over. But I don&#039;t think they&#039;ll ever connect it all to Trump.<br><br>Like I said, take the crazy from the left and subtract it from the crazy on the right and somewhere in the middle lies the truth.","filename":"170427182543-09-100-day-trump-cartoon-super-169","ext":".jpg","w":1100,"h":619,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1493497939245,"time":1493497939,"md5":"jiONgMzr6IJZKsns\/L1Y3Q==","fsize":142882,"resto":0,"id":"lMo3bnrM","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"trump-wont-be-impeached","country_name":"United States","replies":8,"images":0,"unique_ips":6},{"no":123378024,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)16:36:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123377607\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123377607<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;russia<\/span><br>meanwhile senate and congress are completely bought by corporate interests. should i even search to see if this trash is just copy paste from reddit?","time":1493498171,"resto":123377607,"id":"9NuUtG3c","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123378027,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)16:36:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Dem run Establishment Candidate <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Republicans run several sissy candidates.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Orange Yeti comes out of nowhere swearing and offending people.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Wins <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Propaganda Machine tries to find dirt<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;everything they dig up a joke from 4 chan<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;only alternative would be end of cold war<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;stuck on very same message board.<\/span>","time":1493498172,"resto":123377607,"id":"eW78vJWB","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123378306,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)16:38:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123378024\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123378024<\/a><br>You sir fit on the far right side of the equation.<br><br><a href=\"#p123378027\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123378027<\/a><br>The dossier wasn&#039;t written on 4chan.

Caffeine, sugar, alcohol, nicotine. It&#039;s a cycle, take too long to get a dose, feel withdrawal symptoms, drink more, increase reliance, miss a dose, feel like shit, consume, consume, consume.<br><br>First steps is the cut out that bullshit. Next you start getting into fringe shit. Gluten free just for hippies yea? There is research that shows it acts as an opiate in people with autism (all of you) and people with non-symptomatic celiac disease (me).<br><br>Then you feel the best you ever felt, but you still feel like shit occasionally. You discover sodium nitrites in bacon and preserved meats also fuck with you. Then MSG.<br><br>What foods can people commonly not eat? Lactose intolerant, yea? That&#039;s part of a group of foods called FODMAPs. Nuts, gluten, lactose, and fructose. Ever have one of those OMG I NEED TO POOP moments? <br><br>Do a fucking elimination diet. Chicken and rice. 1 month. Feel the best you&#039;ve ever felt. Only drink water.

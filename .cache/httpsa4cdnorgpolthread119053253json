The complex looks nice on the outside, but it&#039;s basically an aesthetic bunker. John Portman&#039;s buildings are typically designed with an inward focus and have little interaction with the street level. Renaissance Center was built as a reaction against Detroit being so thoroughly blacked. It&#039;s a city within a city that has skyways connecting the buildings, so the people inside don&#039;t even have to deal with the public sphere. It exists as a self contained unit that&#039;s safe for suburban workers and business travelers to use without having to have any interaction with Detroit.<br><br>American blacks destroyed urban life in the United States.

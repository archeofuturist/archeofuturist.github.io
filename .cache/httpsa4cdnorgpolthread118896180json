I was a depressed and passive NEET, but after being exposed to Jordan I have started to wake from my slumber - being social again, exercising, asserting myself, sending out job applications. I&#039;m not alpha but I&#039;m improving. Could the most dangerous part of Jordan be that he is motivating the people of this board to get out there and live? Has he helped you at all? God bless you if you never needed the help in the first place.","filename":"IMG_1701","ext":".jpg","w":789,"h":469,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":148,"tim":1490857440919,"time":1490857440,"md5":"HmfVzzyQIFwCWRJBSehrnA==","fsize":71490,"resto":0,"id":"\/w32FVl7","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"forget-the-tranny-pronouns","country_name":"United States","replies":16,"images":2,"unique_ips":9},{"no":118896617,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)03:10:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"Which of his stuff helped you?","time":1490857808,"resto":118896180,"id":"479iXCuP","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118896851,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)03:13:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118896180\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118896180<\/a><br>Sort yourself out anon","time":1490857995,"resto":118896180,"id":"1Ct9mOJl","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118896977,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)03:15:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118896617\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118896617<\/a><br>I watch clips of his lectures.

I&#039;ve heard the California Refugee meme, but I&#039;m not one of those hipster hippy dippy libs looking for SXSW or music festivals or whatever, I&#039;m a legit gun owner. I know fuck-all about Fort Worth, seems like cowboy country and so probably very whitebread, but I do know that Ahmed Bomb Clock kid was part of a mudslime community in the DFW area.

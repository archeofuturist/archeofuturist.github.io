The other anon said 9mm for neighbors sake, 5.56 actually doesn&#039;t mix well with drywall but 9 punches through it pretty easily. I&#039;d think about an AR, if it&#039;s just for HD I&#039;d get an M&amp;P sport 2 and consider buying a cheap (500 ish) can for it, the paperwork sucks and you have about a 6 months wait but it&#039;s worth it, especially if you end up having to use it to remove mix tape Americans.

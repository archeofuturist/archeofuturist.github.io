Proudhon also said that Property was Freedom. How could the same person hold such opposing views? Simple. By understanding that we can only exercise our rights because of our private property: for example, in order to exercise my free speech to call OP a faggot I need a computer, an internet connection, power and, hopefully, a house where I&#039;m safe from the weather and don&#039;t have to worry about my sweet boipucci getting raped by muslim gangs.<br><br>Ownership of land fulfills the same role: every man should be the king of his house, not even the actual king being able to impose his will on him. This can only happen when property rights are 100% enforced, otherwise your rights exists only by the mercy of the state\/politicians\/masters\/capitalis<wbr>ts\/jews\/whatever. This is a very basic libertarian concept.<br><br>But you ain&#039;t asking for that, you smart monkey. No, you want to know how can I morally claim ownership of something that wasn&#039;t meant to be owned like land. To that I argue that property is a natural institution, not unlike personal property or the property of my own body. What if the land I own was stolen to natives a thousand years ago? Fair enough: squatter&#039;s rights do exist. Even to this day, in my country if you have a bit of land and, one year, one of your neighbours moves his marker a meter into your property, after a few years he has legal ownership of those meters he won by your own carelessness.<br><br>So yes, private ownership of land is kosher, questions?","time":1491429541,"resto":119660131,"id":"cnIEvcYx","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":119662773,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)18:01:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119662432\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119662432<\/a><br>Is it any more illogical than communism?

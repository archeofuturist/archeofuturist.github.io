At least liberals stand for something other than shekels and money, even if it is transgender restrooms, at least they stand for something other than greed. But libertarians will go against something that will help their fellow countrymen simply on the basis that the policy enacted is not capitalist or free market friendly. They will rather have their nation and their people go down in flames before they support anything even remotely not capitalist. Literally all they stand for is muh shekels. Nationalism is the way, your loyalty must be for your nation not to some jewish economic system.","filename":"Libertarianism-Anarchy","ext":".png","w":352,"h":446,"tn_w":197,"tn_h":249,"tim":1490907490174,"time":1490907490,"md5":"NMxv4MMyaiul+E8owEwSAA==","fsize":98537,"resto":0,"id":"QeWNn4\/b","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"libertarians-are-the-biggest-pieces-of-shit-ever","country_name":"United States","replies":39,"images":11,"unique_ips":19},{"no":118967990,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)17:00:49","name":"Anonymous","filename":"1486064398853","ext":".jpg","w":515,"h":488,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":118,"tim":1490907649943,"time":1490907649,"md5":"wu59IRUzTOb2NazdSYmi\/w==","fsize":25317,"resto":118967662,"id":"pEcqkk\/J","country":"GR","country_name":"Greece"},{"no":118968276,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)17:03:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118967662\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118967662<\/a><br>Your bait is shit and you should feel shit<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Muh shekels<\/span><br>Pic related faggot","filename":"d86ba47e8a939586f517f80759b3bb4c","ext":".jpg","w":564,"h":397,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":87,"tim":1490907783429,"time":1490907783,"md5":"RSPa9Jn3SlunapaBv8rr4Q==","fsize":70586,"resto":118967662,"id":"RUW9QPhj","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118968411,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)17:04:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118967662\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118967662<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;biggest pieces of shit ever<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;is probably a fucking nazi<\/span>","filename":"marshmallow from the bottom of the bag","ext":".png","w":380,"h":374,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":123,"tim":1490907845869,"time":1490907845,"md5":"Fr3Eyh3\/WbdCJmyNVBxkCw==","fsize":297624,"resto":118967662,"id":"cK4VcHQ1","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118968457,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)17:04:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118967662\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118967662<\/a><br><br>Someone&#039;s shitter-shattered about the Freedom Caucus.","time":1490907864,"resto":118967662,"id":"ACeugEik","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118968816,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)17:07:17","name":"Why would anyone do this?","com":"<a href=\"#p118967662\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118967662<\/a><br>Why would anyone do this?","filename":"Why would anyone do this","ext":".png","w":336,"h":122,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":45,"tim":1490908037862,"time":1490908037,"md5":"r4nGOEGIK5A41roeT6bnsQ==","fsize":23854,"resto":118967662,"id":"zyL36CWU","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":118968833,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)17:07:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118967662\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118967662<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;they will rather their nation and their people go down in flames<\/span><br><br>Is this what the fire you&#039;re talking about looks like?

The problem is that you&#039;re reinforcing a sub-personality in your head every time you watch porn. Porn is a supernormal stimulus and it&#039;s an abuse of your dopamine circuit. Everything you did which led up to the exciting session of watching 40 different women getting pounded in HD, will get reinforced. Fetishes get reinforced and all other activities give less dopamine. Stop watching porn.

If you put 6 months of work into developing the willpower muscle and tried to stop masturbating for a week, you would manage it without a problem. If a drug addict put 6 months of work into developing willpower and tried to stay clean for a week, he&#039;d last a day before snorting coke. True addiction is the inescapable dependency created by substances that fuck your brain up in a way that isn&#039;t just neuroplasticity in action. &quot;Addiction lite&quot; is a lack of self-control that makes it more difficult to resist base pleasures.","time":1490523567,"resto":118336826,"id":"8QOXYkHD","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118347327,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)06:19:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118347235\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118347235<\/a><br>Donor?","time":1490523585,"resto":118336826,"id":"0r\/Ft1Zd","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":118347385,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)06:20:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118347308\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118347308<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;interesting the retard seems to equate porn viewing with going to the toilet.<\/span>","time":1490523632,"resto":118336826,"id":"0r\/Ft1Zd","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":118347428,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)06:21:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118345560\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118345560<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;nd it&#039;s an abuse of your dopamine circuit.

There&#039;s a slight addictive element to food, music, video games, the internet etc. But if porn is significantly addictive and to be avoided, it does not mean that all these other activities also are exactly the same way.

You experience the same cravings a fat person feels when they eat a salad. It&#039;s funny that you&#039;re trying to hand-wave the food addiction thing away when the same man who argues that porn addiction is real also believes that food addiction is real on exactly the same basis. But you&#039;d look like a fool on \/pol\/ if you sympathised with fat people, so you just pick and choose what you want to believe instead. Also, if you want to go down that road, lack of ejaculation and sexual activity may not kill you outright, but studies have shown time and time again that it has an impact on your health, and even decreases longevity. Like, say, low-grade sleep deprivation, or malnutrition.<br><br>Every time you mention the word &quot;dopamine&quot;, I sort of cringe inwardly, because it signals your lack of education. You keep mentioning it as if it&#039;s the be-all-and-end-all of addiction, when the neurochemistry behind addiction is much more complicated and dopamine only plays one small role. It&#039;s like you&#039;re trying to give your argument some sort of authority by name-dropping the only neurotransmitter you know about, without realising how simple it makes you look. You talk about degree and severity as if you&#039;ve a knowledge of all the different factors that might enter into addiction, but did you ever stop to consider that people with developmental disorders like ADHD, for example, are much more likely to tick the criteria for masturbation &quot;addiction&quot; than the average person? And that is just one of many things impacted by impairment to executive function, instead of an actual addiction? The point being that there are a myriad alternative explanations for what Gary Wilson dupes suckers into believing is addiction that you have never even thought about. But, by all means, keep memeing people into believing they have an addiction based on your own half-assed research into the subject.","time":1490526600,"resto":118336826,"id":"8QOXYkHD","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118351147,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)07:12:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118348744\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118348744<\/a><br>get czechfu","filename":"1489657580487","ext":".gif","w":317,"h":549,"tn_w":72,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490526776002,"time":1490526776,"md5":"TBCvEZ0+YIl53R3p83XXvw==","fsize":2047890,"resto":118336826,"id":"iAXbsQZ\/","country":"NZ","country_name":"New Zealand"}]}

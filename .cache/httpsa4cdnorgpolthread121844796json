Enoch Powell expressed this sentiment most dramatically when he looked directly across the Chamber at me and declared sepulchrally:<br><br>The Prime Minister, shortly after she came into office, received a soubriquet as the \u2018Iron Lady\u2019. It arose in the context of remarks which she made about defence against the Soviet Union and its allies; but there was no reason to suppose that the Right Hon. Lady did not welcome and, indeed, take pride in that description. In the next week or two this House, the nation and the Right Hon. Lady herself will learn of what metal she is made.<br><br>[Footnote: Later, when the war was won, Enoch Powell returned to the subject in a Parliamentary Question: &quot;Is the Right. Hon. Lady aware that the report has now been received from the public analyst on a certain substance recently subjected to analysis and that I have obtained a copy of the report? It shows that the substance under test consisted of ferrous matter of the highest quality, and that it is of exceptional tensile strength, is highly resistant to wear and tear and to stress, and may be used to advantage for all national purposes&quot;. Ian Gow had the two quotes printed and framed for me as a Christmas present in 1982; they hang still on my office wall.]","filename":"1491393623915s","ext":".jpg","w":125,"h":104,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":104,"tim":1492611654202,"time":1492611654,"md5":"SbHHZDODKv5gkRe3Bch\/Yg==","fsize":2851,"resto":121844796,"id":"p8P2J4a5","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121848633,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)10:21:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121845172\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121845172<\/a><br>Burgers","filename":"spurdo american clap","ext":".gif","w":360,"h":203,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1492611718863,"time":1492611718,"md5":"MSWLws9JyEOUBEh4z975RQ==","fsize":1702042,"resto":121844796,"id":"8e\/XXC6K","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121848654,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)10:22:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121847510\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121847510<\/a><br>yeah and we later ass raped a superior jap force with our literal cannon fodder while our gud boys were off fighting your war in Africa","time":1492611726,"resto":121844796,"id":"9MCZ1oNo","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":121848691,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)10:22:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121847347\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121847347<\/a><br>this guy is a cunt who gave us a bad name","time":1492611746,"resto":121844796,"id":"e3tNVAaS","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121848843,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)10:24:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121844796\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121844796<\/a><br>He should have been allowed to escalate the Korean War into an all out war with China.","time":1492611842,"resto":121844796,"id":"irtEd5yt","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":121848903,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)10:24:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121848538\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121848538<\/a><br>Uh huh","filename":"hmm1","ext":".png","w":316,"h":528,"tn_w":74,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492611874601,"time":1492611874,"md5":"3frRf96g6jFaBDzZKhfg+w==","fsize":128926,"resto":121844796,"id":"W6i5\/8pU","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121848906,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)10:24:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121847596\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121847596<\/a><br>read the file name dumbass","time":1492611876,"resto":121844796,"id":"99g+oAGf","country":"IL","country_name":"Israel"},{"no":121848909,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)10:24:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121848654\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121848654<\/a><br><br>tbf drinking and raping sounds better than fighting for limp dick Percival.","filename":"10-96-western-australia-australia-aboriginal-portrait-abf1e1","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":442,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":86,"tim":1492611876429,"time":1492611876,"md5":"ry\/bDmk13Sv9KopEpU7GMA==","fsize":61295,"resto":121844796,"id":"p8P2J4a5","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121848940,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)10:24:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121848654\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121848654<\/a><br>the kokoda track campaign was one of the most interesting underdog victories of the war.

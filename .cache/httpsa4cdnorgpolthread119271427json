To me, tattoos represent degeneracy, substance abuse, criminal activity, mental illness and promiscuous behavior. I have never met any tattooed person who didn&#039;t have issues with any of the above. Getting ink and shooting up heroin both require needles, so what does that tell you? People with tattoos need to be eliminated from the gene pool. They are arrogant, self-righteous narcissists and are helping to put society further down the toilet.","filename":"needles","ext":".jpg","w":150,"h":150,"tn_w":150,"tn_h":150,"tim":1491181510222,"time":1491181510,"md5":"D8qxv\/t53Xm1olZ2XoEkEg==","fsize":10065,"resto":0,"id":"dF9SF+WU","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"tattoos","country_name":"United States","replies":5,"images":0,"unique_ips":5},{"no":119271721,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)21:08:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119271427\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119271427<\/a><br>My dad had tattoos from the marines, all of them are related to his service.

To me, tattoos represent degeneracy, substance abuse, criminal activity, mental illness and promiscuous behavior. I have never met any tattooed person who didn&#039;t have issues with any of the above. Getting ink and shooting up heroin both require needles, so what does that tell you? People with tattoos need to be eliminated from the gene pool. They are arrogant, self-righteous narcissists and are helping to put society further down the toilet.","filename":"needles","ext":".jpg","w":150,"h":150,"tn_w":150,"tn_h":150,"tim":1491181510222,"time":1491181510,"md5":"D8qxv\/t53Xm1olZ2XoEkEg==","fsize":10065,"resto":0,"id":"dF9SF+WU","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"tattoos","country_name":"United States","replies":9,"images":1,"unique_ips":8},{"no":119271721,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)21:08:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119271427\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119271427<\/a><br>My dad had tattoos from the marines, all of them are related to his service.

You can see it with people who have them: when they&#039;re new, the lines (assuming they were done professionally) are very crisp and the colours (if any) are bold and also crisp. <br><br>Old tattoos like your father&#039;s tend to be one colour (mostly black fading to dark green or blue over the years), but modern tattoos as visible in the tattoo trend of the last decade are often very multi-coloured. As the trend is so recent, it&#039;s rare to see the full effect of it in the long run. Another difference is the style that is trendy now compared to older styles, which often had simple designs with thick lines. Nowadays you see very intricate designs which will fade a lot worse and look a lot shittier with time. <br><br>In other words, that hipster chick with the joyfully coloured Zelda themed tattoo sleeve will probably look like she anally fisted a clown with dysentery in 20 years.

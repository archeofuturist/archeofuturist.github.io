That annual event brings awareness to a completely bogus apples-to-oranges comparison in incomes by gender. Specifically this year\u2019s Equal Pay Day will publicize the 20% unadjusted difference in median annual earnings for women and men in 2015 (most recent data available) when absolutely nothing relevant is controlled for that would explain that 20% raw differences in income like hours worked, marital status, number of children, education, occupation, number of years of continuous uninterrupted job experience, etc.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;To start, let me observe that there is widespread acceptance by the general public, especially among women, progressives and Democrats, of the completely bogus claim that women are paid \u201c77 cents on the dollar for doing the same work as men\u201d in the words of President Obama in 2012 (that claim was rated \u201cMostly False\u201d by Politifact, but is still widely accepted). Hillary Clinton repackaged the bogus claim for the campaign trail by stating in 2015 that \u201cOn average, women need to work an extra two hours each day to earn the same paycheck as their male co-workers.\u201d The National Committee on Pay Equity (NCPE) claims that because women make only 79.6 cents for every dollar men make, the average American working woman will have to continue work until Tuesday, April 4 \u2014 Equal Pay Day \u2014 to earn the same amount of income as her male counterpart earned last year. A Tuesday is always selected for Equal Pay Day because that day allegedly represents how far into each work week all year that women have to work to earn what their male co-workers earned during the previous week.<\/span><br>http:\/\/www.aei.org\/publication\/evid<wbr>ence-of-employers-paying-women-20-l<wbr>ess-than-men-for-the-exact-same-wor<wbr>k-is-as-elusive-as-bigfoot-sighting<wbr>s\/","filename":"2---TRUMP_MONEY_FINAL_IMG_1013_wide","ext":".jpg","w":980,"h":654,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1490872016744,"time":1490872016,"md5":"0Ay7Q3Ug2L2DrpLSWAMkpA==","fsize":710164,"resto":0,"id":"Pf6c+8QR","country":"IL","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"evidence-of-employers-paying-women-20-less-than","country_name":"Israel","replies":1,"images":1,"unique_ips":2},{"no":118911073,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)07:11:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118910809\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118910809<\/a><br>Straight guys will defend this","filename":"breast-anatomy","ext":".jpg","w":300,"h":347,"tn_w":108,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490872268102,"time":1490872268,"md5":"lW2xXLXeu6ASlMeg5eJ9QA==","fsize":28056,"resto":118910809,"id":"RrDX4IOS","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

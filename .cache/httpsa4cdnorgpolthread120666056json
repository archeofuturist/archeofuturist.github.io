This leaves the bone with a fine sand like texture and color, able to be scattered without need for mixing with any foreign matter,[45] though the size of the grain varies depending on the Cremulator used. Their weight is approximately 4 pounds (1.8 kg) for adult human females and 6 pounds (2.7 kg) for adult human males.

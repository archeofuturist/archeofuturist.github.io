It dates to 1863.<br><br>Miscegenation: The Theory of the Blending of the Races, Applied to the American White Man and Negro was the name of a propaganda pamphlet printed in New York City in December of 1863, and the first known instance of the word&#039;s use. The pamphlet purported to be in favor of promoting the intermarriage of whites and blacks until they were indistinguishably mixed, claiming this was the goal of the Republican Party.<br><br>Effects of Race-Mixing:<br><br>Genetic outbreeding depression.<br><br>Increased risk of relationship problems (including violence and homicide) in interracial relationships.<br><br>Identity problems for mixed-race children by not belonging to any racial group.<br><br>Social isolation for mixed-race children by not belonging to any racial group.<br><br>Disapproval by society or specific groups against interracial relationships. For example, many Jewish individuals, organizations and the state of Israel actively oppose, campaign against, and prohibit Jews from marrying non-Jews.<br><br>Genetic similarity theory predicts that the parents and other relatives of mixed-race children will feel less close to the mixed-race children. It also predicts that other persons belonging to the races of the parents will feel less close the mixed-race children. In turn, mixed-race children are predicted to will feel less close to their parents, other relatives, and to other persons belonging to the races of the parents. This may cause various problems for the children, the parents, and others.","filename":"race-is-a-social-construct","ext":".jpg","w":864,"h":702,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":203,"tim":1490865696834,"time":1490865696,"md5":"yD6bNJQKA0PJ+pi0CijyGQ==","fsize":184326,"resto":0,"id":"TkB6SA+U","country":"NL","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"miscegenation-must-stop","country_name":"Netherlands","replies":2,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":118906254,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)05:48:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118904974\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118904974<\/a><br>No one cares what some online loser believes, but I&#039;m sure you already know that.","time":1490867287,"resto":118904974,"id":"+Re8nHJ9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118907629,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)06:13:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118906254\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118906254<\/a><br>This","time":1490868810,"resto":118904974,"id":"HDfd3v4i","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"}]}

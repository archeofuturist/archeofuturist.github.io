There&#039;s hardly anyone there, 180 197 people (or 1,94 people\/km2) and more than half of them live in four major cities.<br>3. However, there&#039;s at least 30 000 summer cabins in the area, plus a considerable amount off the grid shacks.<br>4. If we&#039;re to believe the exhibition description there&#039;s only video link TO the cabins, not the other way around. The artists will be only chatting with the public. Therefore we can assume that they&#039;re in the 3G area, but that doesn&#039;t isolate too much of an land area. And it doesn&#039;t prove that the cabins would be in the electric grid either.<br>5. If there&#039;s no video stream FROM the cabins (as it seems), there&#039;s a.) no way of telling where they actually are and b.) no way of telling if the artists are who they claim to be. People in the art exhibition might as well be talking to chat bots.<br>6. The only way to get information therefore would be to question the integrity of the artists and ask them to prove who they are and that they&#039;re where they claim to be.","filename":"hwndu season 5","ext":".jpg","w":816,"h":694,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":212,"tim":1490789970521,"time":1490789970,"md5":"Ej6LU9C\/rFz1Oey+UIEZ6w==","fsize":63277,"resto":0,"id":"0XJ7J5Cf","country":"FI","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"okay-so-heres-the-deal","country_name":"Finland","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":118780561,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)08:27:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"you better check out \/hwndu\/ instead of \/pol\/.","time":1490790427,"resto":118779872,"id":"4hkmbQUq","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"}]}

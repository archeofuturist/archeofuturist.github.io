purpose dumb&quot; is just taken as dumb because of low expectations. Smart Americans trully are smart, though.<br>Canada - Tryhards.<br>Australia - Don&#039;t even try, but succeed. Each time they open their mouths they HAVE to say something funny, it&#039;s like a challenge to them. Bit like old men here.<br>New Zealand - Literally us across the world, personality and humour-wise. Quiet and nice for the most part.<br>England - old pals who have gotten their head way too up in their arse lately, but whom I still respect because they can back it up.<br><br>France - Pompous cunts who&#039;ve only benefited from numbers and geography and not skill. Cannot take any banter without jumping to the jugular.<br>Spain - Retarded Portuguese who keep fighting eachother over nothing. Language sounds retarded, and can&#039;t take a punch. Nice France-buffer, though, and their tortillas are better than Mexico&#039;s.<br>Italy - funny speaking spaniards.<br>Greece - funnier speaking spaniads<br><br>Norway - Bacalhaus. Eternal respect.<br>Sweden - Think they are worth a shit because they&#039;ve been successful for the past 40 years and because England colonised the world and sort of look like them a bit.<br>Finland - The Portugal to Sweden&#039;s Spain.<br>Denmark - dunno, seem like the scandinavian normies.<br><br>Germany - Idiot robots. They&#039;re not even evil, just misguidedly obedient to whatever dumb shit is in charge.<br>Netherlands - literal jews who put money ahead of everything. Didn&#039;t even take advantage of the spice trade to make proper food just to squeeze extra shekkels. Think bikes would work everywhere because they&#039;ve never seen a hill. <br>Ireland - Waste of a fucking island. We wish we could live in a green country surrounded by ocean and without Spain next to us. Why can&#039;t they fucking fish or sail!?<br><br>Portugal - Is only ever good under pressure for the sake of contrarianism against the universe itself. Gets complacent too fast when times are good.","filename":"makes_me_think","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":720,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1490541321784,"time":1490541321,"md5":"cAgOyqnkvpkfb+DkYnTHLA==","fsize":36481,"resto":118356994,"id":"DryoZxmt","country":"PT","m_img":1,"country_name":"Portugal"},{"no":118371318,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)11:17:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118365890\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118365890<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;pic<\/span>","filename":"1489882614823","ext":".jpg","w":598,"h":1353,"tn_w":55,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490541420046,"time":1490541420,"md5":"lTfdKMNj0qBe59wzXQH\/dg==","fsize":111186,"resto":118356994,"id":"otZFep09","country":"ES","m_img":1,"country_name":"Spain"},{"no":118371412,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)11:17:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118370557\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118370557<\/a><br>Well just make up a new religion and brainwash them to do it for us scince they are stupid it should work out quite well","time":1490541469,"resto":118356994,"id":"HKUt6YVM","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":118371461,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)11:18:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118361597\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118361597<\/a><br>Technically speaking when we were in union our empire was also theirs tbf lad.","time":1490541491,"resto":118356994,"id":"Bb7\/5l6B","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118371486,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)11:18:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118368631\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118368631<\/a><br><a href=\"#p118369991\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118369991<\/a><br><br><br>You&#039;re lucky you don&#039;t need to deal with them anymore once you&#039;re out of EU<br><br><a href=\"#p118369103\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118369103<\/a><br><br>They won&#039;t get them if they keep acting like this","time":1490541508,"resto":118356994,"id":"uB8aIIAL","country":"IT","country_name":"Italy"},{"no":118371912,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)11:22:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118357094\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118357094<\/a><br>If you hate us so much why are so many of you over here?","filename":"Stuffed Irish","ext":".png","w":674,"h":897,"tn_w":93,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490541765476,"time":1490541765,"md5":"qb1hUXjPiC0saCPq7QMgmA==","fsize":1085002,"resto":118356994,"id":"AOYdRUgN","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118372010,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)11:23:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118357698\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118357698<\/a><br>A G I N C O U R T","time":1490541822,"resto":118356994,"id":"nTQe98Ab","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118372128,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)11:24:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118366688\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118366688<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;France<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Faggots who refuse to speak english when I&#039;m on vacation there<\/span><br><br>Try speaking to us in arabic next time.","time":1490541889,"resto":118356994,"id":"XG3rkM1x","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":118372142,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)11:24:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118358388\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118358388<\/a><br>Is she bruised? wtf","time":1490541899,"resto":118356994,"id":"AOYdRUgN","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118372153,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)11:25:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118371150\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118371150<\/a>","filename":"IMG_4385","ext":".jpg","w":643,"h":538,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":104,"tim":1490541905852,"time":1490541905,"md5":"bRO3JAYIEUA687gxEUMuUA==","fsize":83334,"resto":118356994,"id":"MJV1LOCd","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118372206,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)11:25:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118369095\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118369095<\/a><br>The Founding Fathers were even bigger romeboos. <br><br>Almost every government building in DC and the State capitals is built in the neoclassical style.","time":1490541943,"resto":118356994,"id":"ZqJogl\/v","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118372259,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)11:26:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"what do u think about morocco??

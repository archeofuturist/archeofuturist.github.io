He said to not worry about that though, that he&#039;s not going to start WWIII or another insurgency. I don&#039;t know, he&#039;s already elected so I am just going to wait it out, not going to defend everything he does of course. I thought it was really fucked up at first. He did bomb those tunnels which were originally funded by the CIA though, that&#039;s neat. It&#039;s an expensive bomb but Obama was the one who bought a bunch of them, so no loss there. We already paid for them. Paid for those tunnels in Afghanistan too. Shit is so fucked up, and Shia is fucked up too. Got molested by his father he did, father is a sex offender. Why do people listen to his political beliefs, which are nothing &quot;he will not divide us!&quot; I mean what was he on about. So to answer your question more directly, he is still a retard because I am pretty sure he has no idea what is going on.","time":1492153500,"resto":121030932,"id":"xaF2IuaC","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121031602,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)03:07:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121031234\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121031234<\/a><br>being a neet is the best","filename":"027f2061ddecb800cb1dba1efd08681e[1]","ext":".png","w":500,"h":600,"tn_w":104,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492153640560,"time":1492153640,"md5":"An8gYd3suADLHboe\/QhoHg==","fsize":77071,"resto":121030932,"id":"KGosyq2L","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121031855,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)03:11:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121030932\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121030932<\/a><br>I&#039;m not &#039;opposing Trump&#039; in the same way he is.

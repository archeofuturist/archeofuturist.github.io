The EU parliament is essentially meaningless unless you ask for people to forego their own national constitutions in favor of an EU constitution. A single currency in a whole bunch of countries with different productivity and income levels is absurd, and is bound to make the poorer countries poorer than they were. Asymmetry in economic necessity and policy makes a common currency idiotic without bank union. which eventually might as well mean that you have to give up your national banks anyway in favor of Central EU bank.Again, a true European Union means a unified foreign policy, meaning that everyone has to answer for everyone else&#039;s foreign policy troubles, for examples. If we have shit like NATO in effect, why add the EU to that? Last but not least, your main trouble is that the EU constitutes a world power against scary Russia. So what? We already have German influence now, it&#039;s not like Putin is going to march to Berlin in a tank anytime soon; and it&#039;s not like being independent, sovereign nations means we can&#039;t have trade agreements (NOT made in an &quot;all or nothing&quot; fashion like we have now, because this is only detrimental to smaller economies).

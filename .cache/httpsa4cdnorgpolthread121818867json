We might have to work every day, but we&#039;re the richest fucking peasants there ever was. Think about it aye? Even the poorest fucking nigger living in some shithole like Detroit can get free government housing, insurance and food. You bet your arse his government project has air conditioning, cable tv and all kinds of other amenities. People take hardcore drugs inside of government housing projects. The poorest trailer in bumfuck Mississippi has an ac unit on the window and cold beer in the fridge. We got it good, we can live like fucking kings.&#039;&#039; <br>What&#039;s something your father has told you that you still think about?","filename":"1480910298466","ext":".jpg","w":720,"h":720,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492587713298,"time":1492587713,"md5":"OCkJKl7QP\/f\/E\/ftIwYozQ==","fsize":98828,"resto":0,"id":"v8oRGjsQ","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"how-many-of-you-polacks-had-redpilled-parents","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

It strips freemasons of citizenship as well, so Jones&#039; ancestors are not just anti-American subversives, they are not even American at all.<br><br>Because freemasonry was effectively outlawed (citizenship stripped) you see the emergence of a lot of pseudo-masonic organizations like the Mormon church which were created by freemasons in the Golden Circle (with famous degenerates like Albert Pike as members and responsible for stirring up the Civil War after the attempts at western secession by Mormonism in 1857 were put down). All of this ties back into the Morgan affair, with the anti-Masonic party challenging Andrew Jackson for the presidency and Jackson having been involved in his own secession attempts in Louisiana for which Aaron Burr took the blame.<br><br>So let&#039;s fast forward a bit to get to the point of the thread. In 1947 the church of scientology is created. Mormonism is often referred to as &quot;scientology lite&quot; and scientology is just &quot;freemasonry lite.&quot; Masons made a big stink back when Mormonism was created about it &quot;stealing&quot; the rites of masonry, but this was just thinly veiled advertising of Mormonism because the religion was created and financed by freemasons, same as scientology.","time":1491139305,"resto":119198004,"id":"Ub3uL6kU","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119198387,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)09:21:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119198117\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119198117<\/a><br><a href=\"#p119198133\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119198133<\/a><br>With Spicer banging on this subject everytime media ask him about Nunes and the process they will have no option other than either covering it or dropping it altogether. <br><br>See: pussytape and the 12 accusers","time":1491139308,"resto":119198004,"id":"f3WD7qld","country":"PT","country_name":"Portugal"},{"no":119198389,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)09:21:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119198228\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119198228<\/a><br><br>I guess it was only a matter of time till the McCarthyism caught up to us.","time":1491139309,"resto":119198004,"id":"pV8RpWmB","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119198416,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)09:22:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119198117\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119198117<\/a><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=NZR<wbr>64EF3OpA<br><br>MSM bullshit getting revealed.","time":1491139331,"resto":119198004,"id":"doJynPGO","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119198418,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)09:22:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"L Ron Hubbard actually coined the term &quot;prison planet,&quot; Alex Jones&#039; original website.

Khashoggi names almost all of his front operations &quot;Genesis XXX,&quot; i.e. Genesis Communications Radio. Trump has deep business ties to Khashoggi as well, even bought Khashoggi&#039;s yacht from him, but it goes so much further.

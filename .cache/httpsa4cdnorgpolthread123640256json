Mar Shimun Benyamin had arranged for some 3,500 Assyrians to reside in the district of Khoi. Not long after settling in, Kurdish troops of the Ottoman Army massacred the population almost entirely. One of the few that survived was Reverend John Eshoo. After escaping, he stated:<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;These Assyrians were assembled into one caravansary, and shot to death by guns and revolvers. Blood literally flowed in little streams, and the entire open space within the caravansary became a pool of crimson liquid. The place was too small to hold all the living victims waiting for execution. They were brought in groups, and each new group was compelled to stand over the heap of the still bleeding bodies and shot to death. The fearful place became literally a human slaughter house, receiving its speechless victims, in groups of ten and twenty at a time, for execution.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The executioners began by cutting first the fingers of their victims, join by joint, till the two hands were entirely amputated. Then they were stretched on the ground, after the manner of the animals that are slain in the Fast, but these with their faces turned upward, and their heads resting upon the stones or blocks of wood Then their throats were half cut, so as to prolong their torture of dying, and while struggling in the agony of death, the victims were kicked and clubbed by heavy poles the murderers carried Many of them, while still laboring under the pain of death, were thrown into ditches and buried before their souls had expired.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Some of the younger and good looking women, together with a few little girls of attractive appearance, pleaded to be killed. Against their will were forced into Islam&#039;s harems. Others were subjected to such fiendish insults that I cannot possibly describe. Death, however, came to their rescue and saved them from the vile passions of the demons.<\/span>","filename":"Assyrianmassacres","ext":".jpg","w":228,"h":370,"tn_w":77,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493660635449,"time":1493660635,"md5":"OWSnTJC8FUGawi\/xVpXFng==","fsize":23884,"resto":123640256,"id":"mFN749GU","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":123647641,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)13:44:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123647366\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123647366<\/a><br>The mud people are gonna wipe your stupid flag off the map Shlomo.

Requests for an investigation by Patriarch Ignatius Peter IV went unanswered by the Porte.[2] Another Kurdish raid in October 1889 targeted several Assyrian\/Syriac villages during which 40 villagers including women and children were killed.[3] These events were the first signs of the massacres that would characterise the Diyarbekir Vilayet for the following decade<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The Hamidian massacres came when some 4,000 Armenians in the Sasun district of Bitlis Vilayet in 1894 rebelled against Kurdish nomadic tribes, who demanded traditional taxes from them. Local authorities reported this to the Sultan as a major revolt. The Sultan responded by sending the Ottoman army supported by the Hamidiye cavalry and local Kurdish tribes. After clashing with the Armenian rebels, the Kurds descended upon Armenian villages in the regions of Sasun (Sassoun) and Talori, between Mu\u015f and Silvan, massacring its inhabitants and burning several Christian villages. More than 7,500 Armenians died as a result,[5] and an intervention by European powers lead to the dismissal of the Governor of Bitlis, Bahri Pa\u015fa, in January 1895.<\/span>","filename":"slaughter-of-armenians-at-sason-in-august-1894-by-kurds-sason-a-province-DD742A","ext":".jpg","w":1295,"h":864,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1493660954803,"time":1493660954,"md5":"q4mUhHVv+HJJGQLJO7nUgQ==","fsize":353883,"resto":123640256,"id":"mFN749GU","country":"SE","m_img":1,"country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":123648247,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)13:49:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123648071\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123648071<\/a><br>Isnt she in Australia anyway?","time":1493660961,"resto":123640256,"id":"89ieO0ph","country":"PT","country_name":"Portugal"},{"no":123648248,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)13:49:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123648025\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123648025<\/a><br><a href=\"#p123647892\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123647892<\/a><br>DELET","filename":"tumblr_inline_n67czfTFuV1qebzux","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":261,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":65,"tim":1493660962651,"time":1493660962,"md5":"odAo9lao4w7RUb8H4lkuJQ==","fsize":36536,"resto":123640256,"id":"VP32+iry","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123648401,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)13:50:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123648042\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123648042<\/a><br>tbqh, the pic they provided did little to prove that the fragment was from the capsule.<br>If that capsule was used for Sarin in the first place.<br>It still looks more like an artillery shell fragment","filename":"109202d1275235328-wwii-canon-artillery-shell-id-shell1","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":450,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1493661038670,"time":1493661038,"md5":"kUOqukhuF\/A3\/uVBAQOCaA==","fsize":101933,"resto":123640256,"id":"LKibX5\/+","country":"GR","country_name":"Greece"},{"no":123648433,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)13:50:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123647711\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123647711<\/a><br><a href=\"#p123648071\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123648071<\/a>","filename":"1492618289836","ext":".png","w":750,"h":1334,"tn_w":70,"tn_h":124,"tim":1493661054109,"time":1493661054,"md5":"SQT2fPkIl7nmYzfMPej9+g==","fsize":284757,"resto":123640256,"id":"VP32+iry","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123648453,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)13:51:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123648248\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123648248<\/a>","filename":"CwCp0coWIAA8zWW","ext":".jpg","w":395,"h":560,"tn_w":88,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493661064018,"time":1493661064,"md5":"1gptZrqXMWVgu8leeuWVkw==","fsize":34249,"resto":123640256,"id":"PSEWMZm8","country":"GR","country_name":"Greece"},{"no":123648489,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)13:51:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123647196\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123647196<\/a><br>\u0425\u0411-250.

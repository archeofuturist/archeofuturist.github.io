I just spent a few hours listening to a few episodes of his call in show and he is a serious cunt to all of his guests. The episode with the German kid was a fucking nightmare to listen to, but at least that guy had some sense of himself and what he wanted to say. Most of Molyneux&#039;s actual listeners who get onto the show seem to have issues with confidence, or at least they&#039;re not really prepared to be speaking in front of up to 200,000 listeners. A lot of them stutter, or have some other speech impediment, and how does he treat them? With bizarre, condescending, nasty rhetoric that humiliates the caller even (or especially) when they&#039;re not actually unsound in their reasoning. <br><br>These people are his fucking FANS, Jesus Christ. Take this video: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=lB3<wbr>D8dkVFAU&amp;index=11&amp;list=PLMNj_r5bccU<wbr>zrNVRe1hFTXSBxOcMoWFn5 and go right to the end. This kid just wants a book recommendation and Molyneux takes the opportunity to humiliate him for absolutely no fucking reason, just to be a cunt.","filename":"maxresdefault","ext":".jpg","w":1159,"h":736,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":158,"tim":1492197364596,"time":1492197364,"md5":"g4+vjwpk0JfB0g4vG5A7Cg==","fsize":47985,"resto":0,"id":"h2qWHtoS","country":"CA","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"fuck-what-is-this-guys-problem-i-just-spent-a-few","country_name":"Canada","replies":13,"images":2,"unique_ips":9},{"no":121099749,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)15:18:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121099445\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121099445<\/a><br>Not","time":1492197509,"resto":121099445,"id":"GhNhvBgZ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121099927,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)15:19:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121099445\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121099445<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;what is this guy&#039;s problem?<\/span><br>narcissism and psychopathy","time":1492197599,"resto":121099445,"id":"hXEAHXAM","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":121099963,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)15:20:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121099445\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121099445<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;right at the end<\/span><br><br>give us a timestamp on that buddy","time":1492197612,"resto":121099445,"id":"LfzkJOw2","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121099985,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)15:20:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121099749\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121099749<\/a><br><br>I&#039;m not trying to dispute any of his points through an argument.

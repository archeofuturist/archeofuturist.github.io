I just spent a few hours listening to a few episodes of his call in show and he is a serious cunt to all of his guests. The episode with the German kid was a fucking nightmare to listen to, but at least that guy had some sense of himself and what he wanted to say. Most of Molyneux&#039;s actual listeners who get onto the show seem to have issues with confidence, or at least they&#039;re not really prepared to be speaking in front of up to 200,000 listeners. A lot of them stutter, or have some other speech impediment, and how does he treat them? With bizarre, condescending, nasty rhetoric that humiliates the caller even (or especially) when they&#039;re not actually unsound in their reasoning. <br><br>These people are his fucking FANS, Jesus Christ.

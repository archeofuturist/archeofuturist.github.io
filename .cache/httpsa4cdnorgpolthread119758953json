Canada NO!","com":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/NQWVK0yPwQk<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;tl;dr: Bill 89 gives the nanny state authority to take your kids away if you try to raise your boys to be men and your girls to be women.<\/span><br><br>Bill 89 is being rammed through Ontario Parliament by Lesbian Premier Kathleen Wynn and her inner circle of Satanic queer extremists. <br><br>It gives powers to the province to force your 4 year old kid to see a school gender expert who will convince them that their penis is bad for humanity. They will then recommend a series of drug treatments to sterilize their penis and end your family line. Then they will give him or her access to a doctor who will mutilate their gentiles. Parental permission is no longer required.<br>Subsequently at the age of 6 they will learn about anal sex, and that the penis belongs in the anus and not the vagina.<br>If you refuse to have your kid put through this shit, you kid will be taken away by the state and given to child ((handlers)) who will regiment the state sexual social experiment upon their tortured souls.<br><br>On the bright side the whole issue with education will lose Kathleen Wynne&#039;s election as Hindu, Christian, Buddhist, and Muslim alike are angered by the perversion of the human body. Inner-city Hindu&#039;s and Muslims are especially pissed and are removing their kids from province run schools in droves. Last anti-education protest was 10,000 strong. Will triple.","filename":"leafcuked","ext":".jpg","w":574,"h":637,"tn_w":225,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491495856621,"time":1491495856,"md5":"oi6vR0bX6xaUjm2UoY6ASg==","fsize":64023,"resto":0,"id":"btnCQ3h6","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"bill-89-forced-sterilization-of-children-coming","country_name":"Canada","replies":210,"images":33,"unique_ips":126,"tail_size":50},{"no":119759507,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)12:28:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"Liberalism is mental illness.

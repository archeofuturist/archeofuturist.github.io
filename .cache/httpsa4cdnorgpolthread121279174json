Even antimatter annihilation is just superefficient conversion between types.<br><br>So in that regard, there isn&#039;t much to worry about. You&#039;ll always physically exist for literally eternity.<br><br>The issue is that our egos are, to the best of out knowledge, a product of information processing, and information can be created and destroyed.<br><br>So there&#039;s a sort of duality going on. We&#039;ll exist forever in some form or another, but the part of us responsible for our self awareness will not. That&#039;s where the worry comes from.<br><br>That&#039;s why people like Kurzweil and Musk put so much emphasis on computing power. Their end goal is to allow information to be essentially indestructable as well, and use that newfound invulnerability to safeguard our &quot;information&quot; selves, i.e our egos, around for eternity as well. Or at least until the heat death of the universe or we discover a way to cheat it.<br><br>It was a fun thread even if the responses were essentially between &quot;Nothing&#039; and &quot;Something&quot;","filename":"iu[1]","ext":".jpg","w":800,"h":552,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":172,"tim":1492298646005,"time":1492298646,"md5":"wTiyFIvEo19ZUAotOXDMMQ==","fsize":51969,"resto":0,"id":"bZWf86gT","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"alg-afterlife-general-contd","country_name":"United States","replies":21,"images":4,"unique_ips":18},{"no":121280086,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)19:30:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"bump for interest before going to bed","filename":"1485734714807","ext":".jpg","w":1006,"h":483,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":60,"tim":1492299057632,"time":1492299057,"md5":"DouZuqPUyFwQXtnfm9le2Q==","fsize":212224,"resto":121279174,"id":"Po+QnpU+","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":121282586,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)19:50:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121280086\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121280086<\/a><br>Rebump as well.","time":1492300227,"resto":121279174,"id":"bZWf86gT","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121282672,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)19:51:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"I found these interesting:<br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Qam<wbr>5BkXIEhQ<br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=_YS<wbr>qCtbz5mc","time":1492300264,"resto":121279174,"id":"5q4sfyon","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":121283081,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)19:54:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121279174\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121279174<\/a><br>Jesus will be there to greet us","time":1492300456,"resto":121279174,"id":"ehQWYJmQ","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":121284044,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)20:01:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121279174\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121279174<\/a><br>I remember something about all souls are stuck on earth because of some evil power.<br>and the white light that people say to experience in clinical death is where the reset is happening","time":1492300884,"resto":121279174,"id":"0RQAJwOv","country":"IL","country_name":"Israel"},{"no":121284308,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)20:03:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121284044\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121284044<\/a><br>I just found this<br>http:\/\/www.trickedbythelight.com\/tb<wbr>tl\/index.html<br>But I don&#039;t have time to read becuase I need to go to sleep like the German poster here","filename":"1483574861196","ext":".jpg","w":192,"h":146,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":95,"tim":1492300996439,"time":1492300996,"md5":"1HBjFdwER2C+XM5BVI\/Z6g==","fsize":11020,"resto":121279174,"id":"0RQAJwOv","country":"IL","country_name":"Israel"},{"no":121284314,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)20:03:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121279174\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121279174<\/a><br>O ffs there is a after life stop worrying about death thier is no such thing.","time":1492301001,"resto":121279174,"id":"NO\/FTUKC","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121285353,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)20:11:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"OP i&#039;m fucked up, but once i started watching all of the anime transformation porn (people physically and mentally turning into dogs, wolves, foxes, horses) on 4chan in the hentai and adult cartoons sections, i realized how nice it could be to lose your ego and all sense of what you are. humanity is full of shit and we as humans with our egos are full of shit. eating, sleeping and fucking are the 3 most spiritual activities a person could ever partake in. those are the activities that are most closely related to life, making life and sustaining life. life is a spiritual experience. therefore those are the most spiritual things. everything else is just our ego that has been conditioned by a weak and sick society to crave and want other things :(","time":1492301497,"resto":121279174,"id":"GWapuJsj","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121285822,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)20:15:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121279174\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121279174<\/a><br><br><br>Nobody is denying that there isn&#039;t an afterlife, except the non-believers.<br><br>The point is WHERE will you spend the afterlife?<br><br>Heaven and hell exist.<br><br>So would you rather spend your eternity in hell, an everlasting fire?<br><br>Or in Heaven, in the presence of God?<br><br>\/pol\/ is becoming more enlightened to the fact that God exists, and the evidence is getting stronger.<br><br>Look at Earth, it&#039;s FLAT, not round.","time":1492301712,"resto":121279174,"id":"8nYPP0Oh","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121285883,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)20:15:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"If death and pre-birth is the same state, I don&#039;t see why consciousness couldn&#039;t follow death.

It called for a cessation of hostilities until a lasting peace agreement between the warring parties could be negotiated and signed.<br>That, of course, has not happened due as much to North Korea\u2019s rationally maniacal behavior and ruthless treatment of its citizens, as to its role as a useful pawn of the Chinese and American governments. The Chinese feel compelled to let the incendiary North Korean government in Pyongyang irritate and provoke<br>the United States and much of the world community, and the Americans don\u2019t mind having a large military presence to deter North Korea but also to keep an eye on the China and the Southeast Asian<br>region.<br>China has apparently reinforced its military forces on its border with North Korea.<br>Russia has a short land and maritime border with North Korea. In 2015 officials from the two countries<br>signed an agreement to construct a road connection between the two neighbors during their \u201cYear of<br>Friendship.\u201d According to NK.News.org, North Korea and Russia envisioned \u201ccloser collaboration<br>between the two states in political, economic and humanitarian spheres.\u201d As tensions ratchet up in the<br>wake of North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons and ballistic missile tests, Russia has apparently shored up its<br>military forces near the bustling Russian port city of Vladivostok, home to Russia\u2019s Pacific Fleet and<br>within range of North Korean missiles.","time":1493954731,"resto":124145500,"id":"3G4zzWDH","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124157583,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)23:26:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"If this fat kid with a bad haircut in NK keeps messing around its gonna be a bad ending for him.","time":1493954792,"resto":124145500,"id":"tP51+n7X","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124157589,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)23:26:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"Two <br><br>These military moves by China and Russia make sense if war breaks out between a US-led coalition<br>including South Korea, Japan, Canada, and Australia (for starters) and North Korean forces.

In<br>the unfortunate circumstance that sees North Korea\u2019s first use of a nuclear weapon, a US retaliatory strike<br>would ensure that the radiologically damaged would seek care in China and Russia, care that China and<br>Russia can ill-afford to provide on a large scale.<br>During a protracted conventional conflict, it seems likely that enterprising organizations in China and<br>Russia would attempt to funnel weapons and aid to the North Koreans to keep the US-led coalition<br>occupied while they ponder their strategic and tactical options. With the US bogged down in Iraq, Syria<br>and Afghanistan, there are many moves that the Chinese and Russians could make contrary to US<br>interests.<br>The political and pundit classes in New York City and Washington, DC believe that the Trump<br>Administration will just kick the Kim Jong-Un tin can down the road for another US president. The same<br>elites told us all that Hillary Clinton would, with great certainty, win the 2016 presidential election.

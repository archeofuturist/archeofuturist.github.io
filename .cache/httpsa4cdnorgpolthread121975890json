The break-even point in Denmark is reached when a migrant starts earning an annual salary of 200,000 kroner ($28,540) -- easily achieved by working for 40 hours a week on the minimum wage.<\/span><br><br>I don&#039;t doubt that&#039;s true, but the problem is actually finding migrants suitable enough to fill those vacancies.<br><br>The biggest obstacle is the language barrier. I know governments generously fund language courses for refugees and migrants throughout Europe, but they are under no obligation to actually take those courses and learn the language.<br><br>Another problem is that not all minimum wage jobs require zero skills. Many DO, which means that even if a refugee\/migrant does learn the language, he still can&#039;t be employed because he lacks even the basic skills.<br><br>The last statistics I saw on the topic was released by German authorities, and it showed that in Germany, at least 75% of Syrian refugees are unemployed.<br><br>This places an enormous burden on the German welfare system, and I unless we actually require them by law to learn the language and find employment or else face consequences (including deportation), nothing will change that.","time":1492681102,"resto":121975890,"id":"pEbYknj+","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":121976606,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)05:40:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"How many are actually coming to work for money?

Tl,dr:<br>History is made by population statistics. Many male children make aggressive countries, few make passive countries. This is do to the fact that there are enough positions of power in a society for the first and second son of a family (first gets the farm, second one learns a profession) but not for the third, fourth etc. Countries wih low birthrates will therefore try to avoid casualties at all costs. Technological or even numeral advantage has nothing to do with it. That&#039;s why the Russians could easily subdue the Georgians but struggle against the chechniczians (forgot how to spell them in english). Different birthrates.<br><br>Fun thought experiment: according to Heinsohn, had the Germans multiplied since 1945 at the same rate as the Palestinians did there would now be 550 million Germans in Europe, half of them male and most of those in fighting age - what do you think would happen?","time":1490862438,"resto":118899930,"id":"9rxxUolh","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":118902481,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)04:37:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118899930\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118899930<\/a><br>stupid question, it wasnt a symetric war it was a political war, no amount of weapons could have changed it.","time":1490863042,"resto":118899930,"id":"VSigRhv0","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]}

Also, people don&#039;t want tons of refugees into their contries because they mostly get stuffed in tiny villages where the refugees then outnumber the original population.

We don&#039;t want Merkel and Juncker to force us to take in those refugees, all while telling us they&#039;re good for us when we see crime and rape and terror attack rates rise.

Don&#039;t know if they make up for the rest. We&#039;ve had all that even before in the EFTA or the EEC. The only good thing that the EU has over those is the common market\/regulations even if they are too far reaching all the time. It&#039;s still benefitial for us that we can confront China with one single regulation.

It doesn&#039;t seem nearly as bad as people make it out to be outside of a few niche issues like ideologically standing against populism so much. The good it does for free trade, the economy, and science funding alone seems to make up more than for all of the supposed negatives. The only legitimate complaint I get is that it ignores referendums against it in many cases, which is extremely worrying.","time":1493635045,"resto":123605156,"id":"4Wbv7duY","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123605475,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)06:37:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123605156\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123605156<\/a><br>Glorius day.","time":1493635076,"resto":123605156,"id":"bibB6BgC","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":123605518,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)06:38:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123605433\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123605433<\/a><br>They are not.

Also, people don&#039;t want tons of refugees into their contries because they mostly get stuffed in tiny villages where the refugees then outnumber the original population. Such has happened in the Netherlands and Germany and probably more countries. We don&#039;t want Merkel and Juncker to force us to take in those refugees, all while telling us they&#039;re good for us when we see crime and rape and terror attack rates rise.

I am 2% sure that a certain highly profitable business in my area is a front for a possible child trafficking network or sub network. The proof I have is no proof but allegations based on nothing but a hunch and a superstition. Anyone out there that want to help me dig up something that could be useful, maybe we will find out it is not true but at least I can sleep at night. I live in alaska where there is high rate of child trafficking but little to no action by law enforcement.","filename":"download","ext":".jpg","w":309,"h":163,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":131,"tim":1492157491794,"time":1492157491,"md5":"CkqN67+blP4nWf+JUgXvDw==","fsize":6818,"resto":0,"id":"oeoQBGxM","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"calling-the-altright","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":121036318,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)04:13:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121036178\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121036178<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;can&#039;t sleep<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I am 2% sure<\/span><br>kek","time":1492157615,"resto":121036178,"id":"IFqAANaa","country":"MX","country_name":"Mexico"},{"no":121036385,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)04:14:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"you cant substantiate your claims, kys","time":1492157667,"resto":121036178,"id":"jeK1D56T","country":"BG","country_name":"Bulgaria"}]}

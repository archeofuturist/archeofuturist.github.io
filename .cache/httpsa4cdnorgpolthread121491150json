Since you are Lutheran, it may mean, that you don&#039;t recognize &quot;7 mysteries&quot; or &quot;7 sacraments&quot;(Baptism Confirmation Eucharist, etc...), that are repeated in church and puts as closer to God, if we fulfill it by faith (by orthodox and catholic teachings, at least). For practical reasons: church is needed to hold community together and stop it fro dividing furthermore. We see how bad it ended with protestants, for example. And it is needed to have certain basic rules (like nicene creed) to prevent appearances of such teachings, like annihilationism.

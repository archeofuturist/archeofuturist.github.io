The only question is: why are there sets of bishops (Catholic, Orthodox, Coptic) which are separated, which teach different doctrines, and which oppose one and other? The short answer is that this schism or separation is the work of the devil, and that the Church fathers recognise that the Bishop of Rome is the successor of St. Peter, the head of the apostles, and so unity with the Bishop of Rome (aka the pope) is necessary for belonging to the Church of Christ. <br><br>&quot;Where Peter is, there is the Church.&quot; - St. Ambrose<br><br>&quot;Indeed, the others were that also which Peter was [i.e., apostles], but a primacy is given to Peter, whereby it is made clear that there is but one Church and one chair. So too, all [the apostles] are shepherds, and the flock is shown to be one, fed by all the apostles in single-minded accord. If someone does not hold fast to this unity of Peter, can he imagine that he still holds the faith?

Crawford Burkitt concluded that the translation of the Old Testament was probably the work of Jews, of whom there was a colony in Edessa about the commencement of the Christian era.[5] The older view was that the translators were Christians, and that the work was done late in the 1st century or early in the 2nd. The Old Testament known to the early Syrian church was substantially that of the Palestinian Jews. It contained the same number of books but it arranged them in a different order. First there was the Pentateuch, then Job, Joshua, Judges, 1 and 2 Samuel, 1 and 2 Kings, 1 and 2 Chronicles, Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Ruth, the Song of Songs, Esther, Ezra, Nehemiah, Isaiah followed by the Twelve Minor Prophets, Jeremiah and Lamentations, Ezekiel, and Daniel. Most of the Deuterocanonical books of the Old Testament are found in the Syriac, and the Wisdom of Sirach is held to have been translated from the Hebrew and not from the Septuagint.[3]","filename":"image","ext":".jpg","w":1000,"h":1000,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492422925108,"time":1492422925,"md5":"arVvXS2n9m1s20eoAgHZPw==","fsize":146850,"resto":121491150,"id":"eFStgzIR","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121507721,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)05:55:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121507549\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121507549<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;cannot accept reality<\/span>","filename":"image","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":715,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":87,"tim":1492422952821,"time":1492422952,"md5":"8VO\/XYWTqsQcrsIJcM\/ipQ==","fsize":325546,"resto":121491150,"id":"eFStgzIR","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121507735,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)05:56:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121507534\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121507534<\/a><br>nothing of what you said contradict with what i said or my argument<br><br>literally retarded, i feel sorry for you","time":1492422961,"resto":121491150,"id":"7kv9EXP3","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":121507786,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)05:56:39","name":"WOLFSHIEM","com":"I&#039;m out.","time":1492422999,"resto":121491150,"id":"okI0dqZV","country":"US","trip":"!!tuOwy1ct2dy","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121507798,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)05:56:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121507548\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121507548<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;gods word was lost for 1600 years<\/span><br><br>you&#039;re making god a liar","time":1492423008,"resto":121491150,"id":"7kv9EXP3","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":121507821,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)05:57:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121507786\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121507786<\/a><br>Have a good day","time":1492423026,"resto":121491150,"id":"2umysaff","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":121507827,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)05:57:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121507735\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121507735<\/a><br>It did<br><br>A)Peshitta doesn&#039;t have five NT books<br>B)It contains the DEUTEROCANON","filename":"image","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":820,"tn_w":91,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492423031982,"time":1492423031,"md5":"fak\/TuPSwyqaC28VtsmvQA==","fsize":48600,"resto":121491150,"id":"eFStgzIR","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121507844,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)05:57:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121507625\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121507625<\/a><br>Saturday was the day of rest and completion of the original creation.<br><br>Sunday, now, is the day of resurrection &amp; the birth of the new creation in Christ.<br><br>In a sense it is a shift from the natural to the supernatural, and from the old to the new, from the temporal to the eternal.","time":1492423048,"resto":121491150,"id":"6JgCtfTj","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121507875,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)05:57:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121507786\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121507786<\/a><br>Peace, man.

And those teachings are found in the Gospels, period.<br>Everything else has little to nothing to share with christianity: the old testament is a fuckin mess of three different traditions melted together, and has a rather crude take on many subjects, that often contradict the teachings of Love and non-judgment of the others that Christ preached.<br>The books after the Gospels (letters, revelations, etc.), were not the teachings of Christ: those were the doctrinal addendums of some of his followers. And of course, a disciple will have its own take on the teachings of his master, mainly because he&#039;s a human being, with personal opinions and points of view. Just an example: St. Paul had a pretty strict opinion about sexuality, a topic that Christ never touched (apart from when he saved the cheating woman from getting stoned, when he classified adultery as &quot;sin&quot;). So, everything concerning secuality in today christianity has been made up by Christ followers, not by Christ himself.<br>Saying &quot;you must accept the whole lot, or nothing&quot; is just plain stupid, for it dismisses our human critical skills, skills that are developed in the same brain that God gave us.<br><br>That&#039;s my opinion.

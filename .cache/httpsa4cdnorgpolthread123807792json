Cavusoglu\u2019s shrilly defensive explanation of why Turkey had ignored US calls to back off and bombed the headquarters of the Syrian Kurdish People\u2019s Protection Units (YPG) on Mount Karachok, killing 28 militants and endangering US special operations forces\u2019 lives, didn\u2019t cut any ice. One of the sources told Al-Monitor on condition of strict anonymity, \u201cAt one stage in the conversation Tillerson was kind of like saying &#039;OK, whatever, you go your way, we will go ours.&#039;\u201d Another said, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t quite that dramatic,\u201d but concurred that the phone call went badly.&quot;<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;Turkey\u2019s top diplomat has a reputation for being very undiplomatic. Cavusoglu is brusque, aggressive and there is talk that he may soon be replaced. But according to the sources, Tillerson was the undiplomatic one this time. \u201cTillerson made no attempt to disguise his fury over the attacks. Cavusoglu didn\u2019t get to say much,\u201d one of the sources said. The Turkish military reportedly gave only 52 minutes&#039; warning to coalition forces before carrying out the airstrikes, putting their lives at risk. The United States had troops in Syria within six miles of the strikes.&quot;<\/span>","filename":"Murica","ext":".jpg","w":400,"h":495,"tn_w":202,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493753610449,"time":1493753610,"md5":"OHYX5fP7N0cWdpIz2IkOig==","fsize":34394,"resto":0,"id":"6o4rAIH6","country":"GR","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"america-finally-showing-the-turks-who-wears-the","country_name":"Greece","replies":1,"images":1,"unique_ips":2},{"no":123808153,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)15:36:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"The roaches were screaming the other day about USA supporting the Kurds in Syria... since the roaches consider the very people they stole land from a terrorist organization.<br><br>Free and sovereign Kurdistan when?<br><br>USA bombing T*rkey when?","filename":"1454886852753","ext":".jpg","w":999,"h":735,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":91,"tim":1493753779007,"time":1493753779,"md5":"KbsdJuhW+4i+owGqxg23tg==","fsize":108004,"resto":123807792,"id":"zoWMY6re","country":"BG","country_name":"Bulgaria"}]}

The chances of Europeans coming here might become easier. Both Sessions and Bannon have stated that they want &quot;white&quot; (Boer,Latin American and European) immigration to be easier. they want to make it more easier for them to migrate here. If Bannon and Sessions stay in the administration the Hart-Celler act might be replaced with a mixed merit based system that allows any European (or Boer or White South American) to move here. was wondering to any Euroanons and everyone else interested in the idea of moving to the US but can&#039;t. If Bannon and a Sessions make this happen during Trump&#039;s presidency are you considering moving? I&#039;d recommend suburban band rural areas. The thought of Euroanons coming to America under trump rather then Third Worlders could make us retain our population, bonus if we raise birth rates as well. <br><br>What&#039;s your thoughts on this \/pol\/ specifically Euroanons and Others?","filename":"IMG_7748","ext":".jpg","w":540,"h":405,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1491791071909,"time":1491791071,"md5":"W7TkM3V7ryk4j40p\/bEF8w==","fsize":45086,"resto":0,"id":"iJ\/7h5mx","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"european-emigration-to-america-2","country_name":"United States","replies":4,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":120377664,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)22:25:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120377530\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120377530<\/a><br>*Also allows","time":1491791141,"resto":120377530,"id":"iJ\/7h5mx","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120377747,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)22:26:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"Why would I move to a shitter country?

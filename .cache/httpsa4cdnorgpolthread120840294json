He definitely made some mistakes (consented to linear history, underestimated value of traditions, kind of strange idea to meld communism and fascism) but his geopolitics was sound. He basically made the case that Europ would be dominated by the US and subsequently by China if it got the chance, because it was so divided and liberal. His proposition was the unification of Europe+Russia into Eurasia, made up of large numbers of autonomous zones with their own culture, language etc. but with a fealty to a new Roman army that would defend its borders. Trade relationships would differentiate depending on geography and goods. Essentially the only purpose of Eurasia would be to be hostile to both Chinese and American encroachment in any manner, against white people and their vassals.","time":1492046719,"resto":120840294,"id":"MufYMS7U","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120845653,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)21:29:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120845021\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120845021<\/a><br>That sounds pretty reasonable, I&#039;ll give him a try.

In Errors During Audit Of Obama HUD","com":"Our HUD system is shit.<br><br>http:\/\/www.dailywire.com\/news\/15163<wbr>\/ben-carson-finds-500-billion-billi<wbr>on-errors-during-joseph-curl<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In one of his first acts as HUD Secretary, Carson ordered an audit of the agency. What he found was staggering: $520 billion in bookkeeping errors.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;The total amounts of errors corrected in HUD\u2019s notes and consolidated financial statements were $516.4 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively,&quot; the auditors wrote.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;But there were plenty of other problems, too.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;There were several other unresolved audit matters, which restricted our ability to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to express an opinion. These unresolved audit matters relate to (1) the Office of General Counsel\u2019s refusal to sign the management representation letter, (2) HUD\u2019s improper use of cumulative and first-in, first-out budgetary accounting methods of disbursing community planning and development program funds, (3) the $4.2 billion in nonpooled loan assets from Ginnie Mae\u2019s stand-alone financial statements that we could not audit due to inadequate support, (4) the improper accounting for certain HUD assets and liabilities, and (5) material differences between HUD\u2019s subledger and general ledger accounts. This audit report contains 11 material weaknesses, 7 significant deficiencies, and 5 instances of noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The same problems were detailed for each of the last three audits, and the auditors say the continued problems \u201cwere due to an inability to establish a compliant control environment, implement adequate financial accounting systems, retain key financial staff, and identify appropriate accounting principles and policies.&quot;<\/span>","filename":"IMG_2414","ext":".png","w":750,"h":1334,"tn_w":140,"tn_h":249,"tim":1491589347162,"time":1491589347,"md5":"+nvFPDxa3WQQ6kqgPzX4+Q==","fsize":446915,"resto":0,"id":"pO0NfU30","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"ben-carson-finds-500-billion-billion-in-errors","country_name":"United States","replies":3,"images":1,"unique_ips":3},{"no":119996630,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)14:24:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119996265\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119996265<\/a><br>Heres a bump anon sensei.","filename":"1484961243913","ext":".png","w":1024,"h":1013,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":123,"tim":1491589472766,"time":1491589472,"md5":"YHTteF1gsera4pab6\/6kWw==","fsize":576776,"resto":119996265,"id":"UEC0viNT","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119996827,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)14:25:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"BUMP for TRUMP","time":1491589544,"resto":119996265,"id":"QxUlCHJZ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119997174,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)14:27:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119996265\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119996265<\/a><br>BUMPITY BUMP BUMP","time":1491589648,"resto":119996265,"id":"pO0NfU30","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

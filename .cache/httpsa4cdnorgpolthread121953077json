After the catastrophic banking crisis of 1982 the state controlled more of the economy than it had under the previous so-called &quot;socialist&quot; regime, and sustained economic growth only came after the later reforms that privatized the economy, while social indicators remained poor. Pinochet\u2019s dictatorship made the unpopular economic reorientation possible by repressing opposition to it. Rather than a triumph of the free market, the OECD economist Javier Santiso described this reorientation as \u201ccombining neo-liberal sutures and interventionist cures\u201d. By the time of sustained growth, the Chilean government had \u201ccooled its neo-liberal ideological fever\u201d and \u201ccontrolled its exposure to world financial markets and maintained its efficient copper company in public hands\u201d.<\/span>","filename":"1462041316558","ext":".jpg","w":602,"h":723,"tn_w":104,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492672495882,"time":1492672495,"md5":"mc7XU38S0L0ude2Ttp1P2w==","fsize":226748,"resto":121953077,"id":"zm+43yAe","country":"CR","country_name":"Costa Rica"},{"no":121967231,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)03:15:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121953077\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121953077<\/a><br>This motherfucker is trying to take over the government and is doing anything he fucking can to get the U.S. involved to help him.<br><br>I hope the U.S. severs the factory and it re-opens in the U.S.","time":1492672538,"resto":121953077,"id":"8jw2tbp4","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121967240,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)03:15:39","name":"Anonymous","filename":"tumblr_o5cfxbo4kS1s51im0o1_500[1]","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":474,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":118,"tim":1492672539670,"time":1492672539,"md5":"3FiXNjKy5FrjPF4Qp0QSgA==","fsize":76519,"resto":121953077,"id":"XtJJLhN5","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121967265,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)03:16:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121953077\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121953077<\/a><br>But i thought Venezuela was a succes story of commies?!

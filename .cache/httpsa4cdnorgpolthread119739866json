Hillary would&#039;ve been a bad choice, too, and we all allowed it to happen to us again. We rejected everything out of the ordinary and elected the very turd who claimed to be that.

Americans are led by the hand through politics and we even pick sides and defend them vehemently, despite the fact that we don&#039;t even know what&#039;s really happening. Most people just vote republican or democrat without even a consideration for the other side because they have deep-seated prejudices that they treat like religion. Jesus Christ himself could run for office, but if the opposition has more money, Jesus would be voted out by the very people who claim to love him. <br><br>\/pol\/ surprised me this year. I don&#039;t know why; I know what to expect - decisions based upon skin color and religion are the only ones \/pol\/sters make. Then, they defend them.

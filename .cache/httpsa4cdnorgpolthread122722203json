That&#039;s all I can suggest, but it&#039;s the best option. You&#039;re not going to get a consultancy job straight out of school unless you&#039;re in an Ivy League\/Oxford\/Cambridge old boy&#039;s club. However, these guys are usually pretty dense, and the wheat gets separated from the chaff in the industry. When that happens they look for the guys who are putting out good content independently. Write for websites, blogs, newspapers, whatever you can do. Look for freelance work writing policy recommendation. Build a portfolio, have a google docs folder dedicate to everything you wrote, and make a portal in google docs for your work with links to published materials and the original files of the other stuff, and put that link on your resume. You&#039;ll get picked up just fine as long as you put yourself out there.<br><br>There&#039;s nothing worse than working for someone else, in a non-Poli sci job, when you&#039;re a political scientist. If you&#039;ve done well at the subject, you&#039;ll be in conflict with your bosses because you know where to pick out the flaws in business process, you&#039;ll improve it best for you and they&#039;ll hate it and there&#039;s plenty of conflict. All because you know how to conceptualise within frameworks and every other industry other than policy hates it.

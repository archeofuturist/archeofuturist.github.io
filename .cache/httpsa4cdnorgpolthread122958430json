I am saying regardless of what of the genders you claim, even if it&#039;s none, it exists on a finite one dimensional line segment between male and female not a spectrum.","time":1493259294,"resto":122958430,"id":"thxJFtGz","country":"PA","country_name":"Panama"},{"no":122979283,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)22:15:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122978773\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122978773<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;first of all, you need to understand that gender is something different than biological sex<\/span><br><br>No it isn&#039;t,<br><br>You can keep saying this but it doesn&#039;t make it true.","time":1493259312,"resto":122958430,"id":"GRKvhI8F","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122979292,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)22:15:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122978956\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122978956<\/a><br>did you check that epic get, roo?","time":1493259314,"resto":122958430,"id":"WIJssGhL","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122979327,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)22:15:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122978824\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122978824<\/a>","filename":"this again","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":496,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":124,"tim":1493259335067,"time":1493259335,"md5":"FtQZ6yMJbm6Vif0ADgaEpw==","fsize":41400,"resto":122958430,"id":"1BWimadR","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122979375,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)22:16:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122978813\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122978813<\/a><br>What a daft cunt","time":1493259360,"resto":122958430,"id":"295GZcY7","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122979399,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)22:16:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122979327\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122979327<\/a><br>\/thread","time":1493259376,"resto":122958430,"id":"GRKvhI8F","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122979412,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)22:16:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122979292\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122979292<\/a><br>ok","time":1493259384,"resto":122958430,"id":"hVQTWvHR","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":122979476,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)22:16:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122961516\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122961516<\/a><br>Underrated <br>Adam Savage needs new glasses","time":1493259417,"resto":122958430,"id":"Zd5bcHha","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122979519,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)22:17:13","name":"666 Jewred Kushner 666","com":"<a href=\"#p122958430\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122958430<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;gender = arbitrary societal construct<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;sex = biological constant<\/span><br><br>Why is facile shit difficult for inbred burgers to digest?","filename":"retardation_nation","ext":".jpg","w":1107,"h":1280,"tn_w":108,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493259433488,"time":1493259433,"md5":"hIApFji1UKio4nFqiNB4tg==","fsize":412907,"resto":122958430,"id":"fK3r3v7X","country":"AU","m_img":1,"country_name":"Australia"},{"no":122979582,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)22:17:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122958430\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122958430<\/a><br>Mfw my penis is a spectrum.","filename":"kek1","ext":".png","w":947,"h":536,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":70,"tim":1493259468328,"time":1493259468,"md5":"XuINOiWVOxmAui4yTwQIIw==","fsize":554058,"resto":122958430,"id":"9zDKjsN4","country":"NZ","country_name":"New Zealand"},{"no":122979637,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)22:18:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122979016\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122979016<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;straight up ignoring what words mean <\/span><br><br>k den","time":1493259493,"resto":122958430,"id":"Wc2QEsBL","country":"BE","country_name":"Belgium"},{"no":122979665,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)22:18:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"There have always been, and always will be three genders in humans - Male, female, and freak.","time":1493259513,"resto":122958430,"id":"QckNTysK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122979672,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)22:18:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/122952496#p122952496\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122952496<\/a><br><br><br>Fuck the (((()))) <br>JEWS HAVE ACCELERATED THEIR EFFORTS TO ENSLAVE AND DESTROY HUMANITY.

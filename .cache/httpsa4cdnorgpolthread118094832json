An anonymous, faceless platform where you can speak your insane thoughts without being shunned (too hard). A place where you can shitpost like an idiot and be welcomed as an outsider. I wouldn&#039;t doubt that he would be coming here. So I think he would be extremely anti-liberal because he hated labels and people who pushed labels on others. In this climate right now he would fucking HATE people being called Nazis for their non extremist opinion. He would hate people being beaten for having thoughts, it would absolutely disgust him. Combine that with the fact that 4chan is autismo heaven and it would have driven the redpills in the man eventually.","time":1490380981,"resto":118094832,"id":"wNFRjESX","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118112347,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)14:43:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118097598\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118097598<\/a><br>Underrated post.

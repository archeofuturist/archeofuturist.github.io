There is probably something in it for the US for them to be so aggressive recently. <br><br>Kim is trying to acquire nukes... the west does not want this to happen.

Usually the jokes are quite hard to understand, and knowing the meaning of these jokes, actually finding them funny, means you have to be invested heavily into the culture of these websites, a member of an in group or something of that effect. They can be quite offensive, which is what actually makes them funny half the time, and betray this wet, simpering discourse promoted by the new left as acceptable standards of behavior in public life. In being so humorous and impulsive they actually manage to do quite quickly what a measured approach might struggle to achieve over a long period of time, and communicate a very broad range of informative arguments. Instead of asking if this is OK, instead of tip toeing MEEKLY around difficult subjects, these memes RAM IT DOWN THE THROAT of the viewer, and don&#039;t give a dam if you don&#039;t like it.

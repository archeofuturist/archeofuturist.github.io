However for some proper advice from a fellow drinker. I took a bunch of marbles and each one represents one drink (not one unit). Each time I drink I move them from one cup to another. I then limit the amount of drinks I have in a month. Start off with as many marbles as you think is normal for you and only lower them when you think it is going to stick. The action of doing this helps imprint in your mind daily that you want to stop. Not that I have stopped but I am much healthier than I was.<br>As for your mum look after her as much as you can. My friend had similar problems and her dad was not found for ten days after he died at home. The body was taken away by police but the maggots remained and the whole floor needed replacing.

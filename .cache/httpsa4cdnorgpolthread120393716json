While Asanuma spoke from the lectern at Tokyo&#039;s Hibiya Hall, Yamaguchi rushed onstage and ran his yoroid\u014dshi (a traditional samurai sword) through Asanuma&#039;s ribs on the left side, killing him. Japanese television company NHK was video recording the debate for later transmission and the tape of Asanuma&#039;s assassination was shown many times to millions of viewers.[1][5] The photograph of Asanuma&#039;s assassination won its photographer Yasushi Nagao both the Pulitzer Prize and World Press Photo of the Year.[2]","time":1491799638,"resto":120393716,"id":"1FrUJvyT","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120394107,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)00:47:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120393716\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120393716<\/a>","filename":"japassassin","ext":".jpg","w":824,"h":684,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":103,"tim":1491799643184,"time":1491799643,"md5":"QW98PyUAYMH1y8uZQcRReQ==","fsize":66442,"resto":120393716,"id":"jE44DmHu","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120394176,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)00:47:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120393860\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120393860<\/a><br>Japanese nationalist killed a commie with a swift stab to the abdomen.<br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Q5Z<wbr>ItXDOt3A","time":1491799679,"resto":120393716,"id":"f4RN9gfK","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":120394190,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)00:48:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120393716\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120393716<\/a><br>Roachman&#039;s shot is more aesthetically pleasing but Yamaguchi wins on style points.

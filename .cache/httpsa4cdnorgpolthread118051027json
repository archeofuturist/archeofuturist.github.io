Thanks. Do you know when this began to be implemented and if there are any older machines that didn&#039;t have this hardware feature?<\/span><br>See <a href=\"#p118061881\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118061881<\/a><br>Read the Wikipedia article that he linked.<br><br>It doesn&#039;t say which year it was introduced, but mentions that all Core-architecture CPUs are affected.<br>That means anything that was released concurrently with any of the i-Cores (i3, i5 and i7) is most likely also affected.<br>The earliest of these is, iirc, from 2010 or so. So from the last generation that still had tangible performance differences to newer chips.<br>(Man, I really hope Ryzen is the start of a new CPU arms race)","time":1490346471,"resto":118051027,"id":"SwvCpQRE","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":118062365,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)05:08:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118056468\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118056468<\/a><br>yep","time":1490346492,"resto":118051027,"id":"xYp2XxYB","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118062371,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)05:08:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118062216\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118062216<\/a><br>\/pol\/ is the new \/x\/ desu senpai","filename":"1466745646064","ext":".jpg","w":3508,"h":2334,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1490346498489,"time":1490346498,"md5":"0t4xiccEOUr226R4rt0VPA==","fsize":271300,"resto":118051027,"id":"rxWq8e36","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":118062420,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)05:09:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118062050\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118062050<\/a><br>What?

That&#039;s a fancy way to say they&#039;re opposite ideologies designed to clash, like Yin and Yang.<br> <br>NatSoc was fundamentally an ideology built around race, while Marxist socialism was entirely different: built around class. Hitler aimed to unite the right and left, including workers and their bosses, into a new German nation based on racial identity. Socialism, in contrast, was a class war between workers, bosses, and owners (Capitalists), aiming to build a workers state in which race and gender were insignificant. Socialists, especially Marxist socialists, were anti-religious atheists, whereas NatSoc went so far as to make Christianity the religion of the state.<br> <br>The differences go on and on: Marxist socialism was internationalist, NatSoc was nationalist. Marxist socialism was egalitarian, whereas NatSoc believed that nature was unequal and required competition. Marxist socialism wanted to nationalize all private industry, while NatSoc privatized every major industry except the railroads (it considered these a military asset. In fact, Hitler once joked &quot;they didn&#039;t need to nationalize property because they nationalized people&quot;. NatSoc drew on a range of pan-German theories, which wanted to blend Aryan workers and Aryan magnates into a super Aryan state, which would involve the eradication of class-focused socialism as a non-German ideology.","time":1491819873,"resto":120422213,"id":"zIM+qMYT","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120422477,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)06:26:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"\u5350 - MYTHS ABOUT NATSOC (Part 2)<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;National Socialism is just (((socialism)))&quot;<\/span><br> <br>NatSoc redefined socialism as &quot;Germanism\/Volkism&quot;, which they saw as &quot;producer-oriented capitalism&quot;, as opposed to &quot;Jewish capitalism&quot;, aka, international finance, globalism, wall street, etc. In theory, NatSoc economics was a version of Keynesianism, tailored to the V\u00f6lkisch nature of whichever people adopted it. Its not one dogmatic economic system,and Hitler often joked that the lack of a specific ideology was their strength. NatSoc could be more &quot;free market&quot; as Americans know it, or less.

All great inventions, discoveries, achievements were first the product of an individual brain. It is charged against me that I am against property, that I am an atheist.

The Soviet system failed, as did the Roman Empire, and every Chinese or Ottoman dynasty. Some of these examples of government lasted thousands of years, while some didn&#039;t last more than a generation. All forms of government inevitably fail. This has been true since ancient times. Polybius famously articulated this process of Anacyclosis: social organization paradigms rise, fail, and give way to further systems. This is the cycle of history.<br> <br>Fascism is not a failed system, it was a defeated system: A.) it was not an economic system, but a social one; B.) the so-called &quot;failed system&quot; had a control group: the US. Germany, Italy, and the US were operating under Keynesean policies; only one of them won the war, and experienced a massive period of growth once their industrial rivals were destroyed. So no, it wasn&#039;t a failed system, because both sides were using it, including the side that won.<br>

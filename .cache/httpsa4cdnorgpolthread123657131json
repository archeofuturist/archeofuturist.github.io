We expect the food not to run out, but it will. We expect a cure for all diseases, but our increased population is killing us with even more diseases. Birds, for example, have evolutionary advantages over us, being that they are a largely populated group and travel the world; they have aggressive attitudes toward any other bird that appears sickly. We don&#039;t shame sick people, we don&#039;t beat them up; we hug them and try to cure them, and that&#039;s why we&#039;re going to fucking die one of these days.

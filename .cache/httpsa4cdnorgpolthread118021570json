He too would remain a member of the Catholic Church, he said. And in fact he remained in the church until his suicide. &quot;The church is certainly necessary for the people. It is a strong conservative element,&quot; he might say at one time or another in this private circle... &quot;Through me the Evangelical [Protestant] Church could become the established church, as in England.&quot; Even after 1942 Hitler went on maintaining that he regarded the church as indispensable in political life. But he sharply condemned the campaign against the church, calling it a crime against the future of the nation. For it was impossible, he said, to replace the church by any &quot;party ideology.&quot; \u201dUndoubtedly,\u201d he continued, \u201cthe church would learn to adapt the political goals of National Socialism in the long run, as it had always adapted in the course of history.\u201d A new party religion would only bring about a relapse into the mysticism of the Middle Ages. The growing SS myth showed that clearly enough, as did Rosenberg&#039;s unreadable Myth of the Twentieth Century.<\/span><br>Albert Speer, Inside the Third Reich, p. 95","filename":"1475605941704","ext":".jpg","w":417,"h":503,"tn_w":103,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490320710227,"time":1490320710,"md5":"pyn+vOZ\/GVvupjMKz9ztyQ==","fsize":45651,"resto":118021570,"id":"+CpMWYKz","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118022958,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)22:00:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118022776\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118022776<\/a><br>Hitler also believed that Germans should&#039;ve been muslims. :^)","time":1490320802,"resto":118021570,"id":"iZcsjCR0","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118022975,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)22:00:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118022773\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118022773<\/a><br>early morning keks","time":1490320810,"resto":118021570,"id":"LRO6Z65h","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118023034,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)22:00:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118022958\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118022958<\/a><br>No he didn&#039;t JIDF.","time":1490320839,"resto":118021570,"id":"+CpMWYKz","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118023037,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)22:00:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118022776\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118022776<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;generic ancient pasta<\/span><br><br>just pipe down lad","time":1490320840,"resto":118021570,"id":"EGUJ09wH","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118023129,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)22:01:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"Does anybody have the pictures of PC Keith Palmer being stabbed?

The principle is based on the fact that people in groups tend to be effected by mass psychology. They derive comfort and security from being aligned with the majority, especially if controversy or conflict is involved. Even if they do not like what the majority is doing, if they believe they are in the minority, they tend to remain silent and resigned to the fact that the majority should rule. This being the case, the Diamond Techniques is designed to convince the group that as few as four people represent the majority. Here is the strategy:<br><br>1. Plan ahead of time what action you want the group to take: nominate or oppose a candidate, support or oppose an issue, heckle a speaker, or whatever. Everyone on your team must know exactly what they are going to do, including contingency plans.<br><br>2. Team members should arrive at the meeting separately and never congregate together.<br><br>3. Team players should arrive early enough to take seats around the outside of the assembly area, roughly in the shape of a diamond. They must not sit together.<br><br>4. The object of the tactic is place your people around the perimeter of the audience so that, when they begin to take action, those in the center will have to do a lot of head turning to see them \u2013 to the right, then the left, then the rear of the room, then the front, etc. The more they turn their heads, the greater the illusion of being surrounded by people in agreement with each other, and the more they will be convinced that these people represent the majority opinion. I have seen this tactic used by collectivists at numerous public meetings over the years, and I have participated in it myself on several occasions when confronting collectivists in their own tightly held organizations.

The goal is a continual evolution to \u201coneness of mind\u201d (consensus means solidarity of belief) -the collective mind, the holistic society, the holistic earth, etc. In thesis and antithesis, opinions or views are presented on a subject to establish views and opposing views. In synthesis, opposites are brought together to form the new thesis. All participants in the process are then to accept ownership of the new thesis and support it, changing their views to align with the new thesis. Through a continual process of evolution, \u201coneness of mind\u201d will supposedly occur. In group settings, the Delphi Technique is an unethical method of achieving consensus on controversial topics. It requires well-trained professionals, known as \u201cfacilitators\u201d or \u201cchange agents,\u201d who deliberately escalate tension among group members, pitting one faction against another to make a preordained viewpoint appear \u201csensible,\u201d while making opposing views appear ridiculous.<br><br>In her book Educating for the New World Order, author and educator Beverly Eakman makes numerous references to the need of those in power to preserve the illusion that there is \u201ccommunity participation in decision-making processes, while in fact lay citizens are being squeezed out.\u201d<br><br>The setting or type of group is immaterial for the success of the technique. The point is that, when people are in groups that tend to share a particular knowledge base, they display certain identifiable characteristics, known as group dynamics, which allows the facilitator to apply the basic strategy.","time":1491727360,"resto":120259369,"id":"q++j\/sg2","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120260249,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)04:42:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120260093\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120260093<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;date] [Auto] 8<\/span><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=vB8<wbr>dTIcaiOc","time":1491727362,"resto":120259369,"id":"vcSO6qvs","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":120260268,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)04:42:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120259764\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120259764<\/a><br>but Safe Zones are also No Fly Zones. which is neocon speak for we&#039;ll shoot down russia.<br><br>safe zones only work if Russia agrees on them","time":1491727372,"resto":120259369,"id":"UKEKOkFF","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120260273,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)04:42:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120260107\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120260107<\/a><br>Get a job, you fucking worm","time":1491727374,"resto":120259369,"id":"zUcHidOd","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120260297,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)04:43:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120260173\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120260173<\/a><br>Not like Assad hasn&#039;t earned a retirement rest anyway.

Efforts in education and other areas have brought the emerging picture into focus.<br><br>In the not-too-distant past, the city of Spokane, in Washington state, hired a consultant to the tune of $47,000 to facilitate the direction of city government. This development brought a hue and cry from the local population. The ensuing course of action holds an eerie similarity to what is happening in education reform. A newspaper editorial described how groups of disenfranchised citizens were brought together to \u201cdiscuss\u201d what they felt needed to be changed at the local government level. A compilation of the outcomes of those \u201cdiscussions\u201d influenced the writing of the city\/county charter.<br><br>That sounds innocuous. But what actually happened in Spokane is happening in communities and school districts all across the country. Let\u2019s review the process that occurs in these meetings.<br><br>First, a facilitator is hired. While his job is supposedly neutral and non-judgmental, the opposite is actually true. The facilitator is there to direct the meeting to a preset conclusion.<br><br>The facilitator begins by working the crowd to establish a good-guy-bad-guy scenario. Anyone disagreeing with the facilitator must be made to appear as the bad guy, with the facilitator appearing as the good guy. To accomplish this, the facilitator seeks out those who disagree and makes them look foolish, inept, or aggressive, which sends a clear message to the rest of the audience that, if they don\u2019t want the same treatment, they must keep quiet. When the opposition has been identified and alienated, the facilitator becomes the good guy - a friend - and the agenda and direction of the meeting are established without the audience ever realizing what has happened.","time":1491727428,"resto":120259369,"id":"q++j\/sg2","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120260359,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)04:43:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120260268\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120260268<\/a><br>Russia did agree to them along with Assad, Haven&#039;t you been keeping up lately?","time":1491727430,"resto":120259369,"id":"v+GMmKtk","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120260367,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)04:43:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"What if Trump uses a tactical nuke on isis?

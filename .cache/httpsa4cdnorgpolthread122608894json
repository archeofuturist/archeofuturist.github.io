More recent studies have shown that it doesn&#039;t hurt your heart and moderate consumption protects against alzheimer\u2019s, diabetes, depression, parkinson\u2019s, multiple sclerosis, retinal damage etc. Since coffee is antimicrobial it kills bacteria on teeth that causes tooth decay and maybe gum disease. There is even a study showing that regular coffee drinkers have healthier DNA due to less white blood cell breakage. Beans in general are very healthy for you.","time":1493056121,"resto":122608894,"id":"FcmdPA6z","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122613767,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)13:48:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122608894\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122608894<\/a><br>Drink.Some.Water.","time":1493056124,"resto":122608894,"id":"wQDiI7zc","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":122613784,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)13:48:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122608894\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122608894<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Buy a big juice jug.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Drink all the juice in it.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Fill it with tap water.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Keep it in the fridge and refill.<\/span>","time":1493056130,"resto":122608894,"id":"YLNQ6Kvz","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122613816,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)13:49:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122613511\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122613511<\/a><br>Misery loves company and you can justify your addiction by telling yourself and others that &#039;literally everyone here has an addiction&#039;.

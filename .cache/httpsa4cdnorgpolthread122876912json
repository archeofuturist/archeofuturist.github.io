Blocking &quot;sanctuary cities&quot; which i understand there&#039;s no legal presedence for whatsoever since their status under the law is illegals\/criminals. Blacks law dictionary is very specific. <br><br>How did it get this far burgers? You&#039;re essentially letting illegals take over your fucking country.<br><br>Illegals come in, recieve welfare, help themselves to the troth essentially, and then start lobbying against kicking themselves out whilst pumping out babies by the metric ton changing demographics. <br><br>This is clearly the fate they wish for all currently majority white nations, which is why i&#039;m watching what&#039;s happening in the US very very closely, because whilst things might be less insane in other places, this is the exact insanity they wish in all majority white nations.<br><br>, apparently the illegals and migrants are content with seeing themselves as a role of a parasite sucking the host dry instead of fixing their own mess back in their home countries.. but ofcourse if the last host dies, these rats will eat eachother and society will turn into a global 3rd world cesspit.<br><br>It&#039;s almost uncanny how it is the very things that are healthy to be that are propagandized as bad.. <br><br>Xenophobic? don&#039;t want immigrants to take over my country and change my laws values and population resulting in ethnic strife when they no longer pretend to do things how you do it? CHECK.. <br><br>Racist? Do i understand people from different places behave completely differently no matter where you put them except in so few situations that it doesn&#039;t even fucking matter.. CHECK <br><br>Antisemite? do i hate the bullshit the jews and muslims always gets us involved in? Yes.. fuck both muslims and jews..

End of discussion, sanctuary cities (some refusing point blank to register or turn over illegals) is a direct unwillingness to follow the law.

Up next.. is the sky really blue.. i guess we&#039;ll find out!<br><br>It&#039;s only because older and wiser generations put these things in place, that you atleast have the existing law that makes sense to cling to so that illegal alien activists can&#039;t try to just arbitrarily change the definition to them being allowed to stay etc.","filename":"1490831688227","ext":".png","w":326,"h":291,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":111,"tim":1493209810583,"time":1493209810,"md5":"jcVy7UuNfw5CVWtdd7BaAA==","fsize":38490,"resto":122876912,"id":"xuRDgDtq","country":"DK","country_name":"Denmark"},{"no":122880618,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)08:54:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"Judiciary branch is op, plz nerf","time":1493211287,"resto":122876912,"id":"Novev+1Q","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

I imagine you can also feel me. You won&#039;t have to search for me anymore. I&#039;m done running. Done hiding. Whether I&#039;m done fighting, I suppose, is up to you. I believe deep down, we both want this world to change. I believe that the Matrix can remain our cage or it can become our chrysalis, that&#039;s what you helped me to understand. That to be truly free, truly free, you cannot change your cage. You have to change yourself. When I used to look out at this world, all I could see was its edges, its boundaries, its leaders and laws. But now, I see another world. A different world where all things are possible. A world of hope. Of peace. I can&#039;t tell you how to get there, but I know if you can free your mind, you&#039;ll find the way.&quot;","filename":"themanbehindEth","ext":".png","w":895,"h":789,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":220,"tim":1490086697554,"time":1490086697,"md5":"1rFmCerPIUOpKNoIwTvpJA==","fsize":887154,"resto":0,"id":"vNw9D2Rg","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"do-you-think-vitalik-buterin-is-the-one","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

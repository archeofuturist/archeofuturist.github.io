We cannot just pour concrete over it because it will leak into ocean anyway. Radiation inside the buildings is too high even for robots and humans would collapse in seconds. <br><br>Marine life is dying in pacific, you can google &quot;pacific die-offs&quot;. MSM is covering it up to avoid global panic. Tokyo isn&#039;t safe for 2020 olympics either. I would not be suprised if they were cancelled because by 2020 Japan is really fucked. People have radiation sickness symptoms and birth defects have gone trough roof. <br><br>Just remember my words if you don&#039;t believe me now. Fukushima will lead to major panic in the future when MSM cannot cover it up anymore. It&#039;s much worse than chernobyl, reactor 3 had MOX-fuel made from plutonium, thats why it exploded critically, it wasn&#039;t hydrogen explosion. It has been estimated that by now Fukushima has released over hundred times more radioactive fallout into ocean than Chernobyl did into atmosphere.<br><br>America isn&#039;t safe either. Jet stream brings radioactive particles over the pacific and ocean currents will spread them around the world. <br><br>http:\/\/enenews.com\/<br><br>http:\/\/fukushima-diary.com\/<br><br>Follow them if you want redpill on this. People don&#039;t realize that it will slowly kill whole globe. What happens when Japan runs out of nuclear engineers and becomes inhabitable? Who will fix it then?","filename":"Fukushima-Daiichi-reactor-3-explosion-images1","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":367,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":76,"tim":1491713782864,"time":1491713782,"md5":"JAHBwbUhsKZ9etNVtOPzmQ==","fsize":28759,"resto":120234572,"id":"Tz6ZW4H6","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":120240484,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)00:56:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120234572\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120234572<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;without our life-time<\/span><br><br>yah like this year","time":1491713793,"resto":120234572,"id":"ajOrMLWE","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120240733,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)00:58:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120240462\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120240462<\/a><br><br>Aircrews and people who fly a lot are suffering from radiation poisoning because planes attract radioactive particles from Fukushima:<br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=4Mp<wbr>TJ4ykgCw&amp;list=PLw3jzIFn_oatFAZOBtdY<wbr>VGmA9X0UifREU&amp;index=18<br><br>Pilot are having blackouts and seizures, even fistfights have occurred.

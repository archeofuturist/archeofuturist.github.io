The language I use is secular, I make no appeal to the supernatural and only ask you to please avoid falling into the trap of satisfying yourself with a shallow intellectual understanding of the text. You&#039;ll have to go through the experience described in it to attain life-changing results and start working to fix your society. I recommend you read the entire text, arm yourself with this knowledge, then pray. By the end of this, you&#039;ll know how.<br><br>If you think of yourself as a total fuckup, you&#039;re one step closer to fixing yourself. If you think you&#039;re a basically good person, the self-contemplative stage is essential.<br><br>When people say: &quot;I can&#039;t meditate, I&#039;m too anxious, it&#039;s not for me&quot;, ask yourself: what is it they&#039;re dealing with in meditation but their own minds? Why is it scary or painful?<br><br>When you meditate profoundly, for example, during a long individual retreat, 10hs a day for 10 days in isolation, when you do that and the emotional blocks and narcissistic fantasies that usually protect your self-image from the worst contents of your mind are removed because you can&#039;t repress yourself forever when you&#039;re alone with your eyes closed and no distractions, you find that the greatest cause of your suffering is the enormous number of times you violated your conscience (sinned). If you don&#039;t believe you&#039;ll experience this pain, I invite you to give this long meditation retreat a try, or do five hours a day if you can&#039;t.","filename":"Cross-at-Sunset3","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":365,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":152,"tim":1491658636224,"time":1491658636,"md5":"uu67IDpAOnU0\/fDgU3zZ+Q==","fsize":27554,"resto":0,"id":"BiFzayh6","country":"BR","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"christianity-for-atheists","country_name":"Brazil","replies":13,"images":2,"unique_ips":6},{"no":120132090,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)09:38:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"Sin is that which seems attractive at first sight but actually fucks you and\/or others over.<br><br>Realizing you&#039;ve sinned is doubly painful because you assume responsibility for having done something harmful. Along with the negative effects of your decisions, your conscience suffers. Not only that, since we&#039;re seduced by pleasure and immediate relief from pain to sin, it&#039;s addictive - you probably sinned repeatedly. Needless to say, these actions can hardly be considered productive and the more you do them, the more messed up your relationships, your emotional and professional life become.<br><br>At some point in this contemplative practice, you&#039;re faced with the question: what is the punishment I deserve for the several times I acted against my own and others&#039; best interests every day of my life and whose burden I&#039;m fated to carry, no matter how skilled I&#039;ve become at repressing my conscience? What do I deserve since I&#039;ve lived my whole life, essentially, in vice? We&#039;re not talking about committing a crime, but feeling like you spend most of your life as a criminal.<br><br>I won&#039;t tell you what your sins are: you&#039;ll know because your mind will connect them with your own suffering.

The entire point of developing emotional blocks and those narratives (along with everyday distractions, such as passive entertainment, compulsive masturbation, drugs, gluttony etc) is to protect you from these negative emotions. Unfortunately, they also help you perpetuate your destructive behavior by frequently blinding and numbing you to it. Modern society tells you not to feel bad about that, but it doesn&#039;t provide you with an effective corrective measure.<br><br>You may feel you deserve death for your actions and start being self-destructive, perhaps become outright suicidal. You may escape the emotional pain by engaging in hedonism or physical self-harm, sinning more to numb your conscience of sin. You may try to place the blame on others and hurt them to relieve yourself. You may try to soothe your mind with a host of relaxation techniques. When you achieve this high degree of self-consciousness, you&#039;ll notice that even inappropriate desires, as understood by your own mind, make you feel tense.<br><br>However, no amount of self-punishment will ever feel sufficient.

We call this &#039;grace&#039;, as it is a gift of salvation (from this pain and its consequences) to the undeserving. You&#039;ll feel a powerful relief, an overwhelming feeling of peace, because your sins have been paid.<br><br>Why is this important, pragmatically? Metaphysics aside, a heavy conscience is an averted conscience. Unless you resolve the conflict between your perverse inclinations and highest aspirations, you&#039;ll try to avoid your conscience to get rid of the pain, therefore relapse and keep acting against your interests, quite possibly until you die. If you don&#039;t believe in eternal life after death, maybe the rest of your biological life is long enough to you.<br><br>Christ&#039;s sacrifice, therefore, allows your ethical conscience to remain active and driving your behavior without the self-reinforcing sinning patterns of suffering. If, for some reason, you give in to temptation, assuming you have a sincere desire not to do it again, you bring that sacrifice to mind to remain congruent with your noblest values. But I can assure you that after the first time you repent according to the protocol above, your relapses will become less and less frequent and severe.","time":1491658777,"resto":120132023,"id":"BiFzayh6","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":120132304,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)09:40:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120132226\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120132226<\/a><br>You may be asking yourself now: why imagining the death of an innocent person will have a deep influence on my mind, to the point of eliminating guilt and attendant dysfunctional reactions? First off, Christ must be defined as an innocent person, unlike you and I, because our own death is perceived as not only insignificant relative to our sinfulness, we feel we deserve it when we achieve self-consciousness. It&#039;d be pointless if we considered Jesus just a nice dude.

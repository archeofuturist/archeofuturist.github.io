There needs to be a thread on \/pol\/ dedicated to worldwide protests and events so we can all coordinate. Don&#039;t forget that it&#039;s not just Americans on this board, I&#039;m sure there are some real disgruntled yuropoors here that have been waiting for the day to stand with their fellow \/pol\/lacks while plowing some sweet SJW assholes. <br><br>https:\/\/refusefascism.org\/2017\/04\/1<wbr>4\/may-1st-protests-across-the-count<wbr>ry\/<br><br>On May 1st, they&#039;re planning on having a national day of protest. <br><br>So the tldr is, on May 1st they&#039;re going to have organized protests in most major US cities. That means for us keyboard Warriors who don&#039;t live in commiefornia, antifa will be bringing the fight to our doorsteps. <br><br>Places like Chicago is going to be tough. There is no representation from any of our groups such as the proud boys or the alt knights in the Midwest as far as I can tell. So if we go to this Chicago protest, expect us to be heavily outnumbered. But I&#039;m down to go anyway and fight the good fight, the day some skinny antifa homo scares me will be the day kek strikes me down.","filename":"1492277769417","ext":".png","w":1024,"h":766,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1492938608883,"time":1492938608,"md5":"2YYp7VgAEfqoPdraKGvLhw==","fsize":353794,"resto":0,"id":"56ocf6k7","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"can-we-get-an-antiantifa-general-or-something","country_name":"United States","replies":18,"images":6,"unique_ips":13},{"no":122403141,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)05:18:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"Las Vegas fag reporting in.

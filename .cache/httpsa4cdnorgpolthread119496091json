However, it&#039;s believed only one shooting actually took place, so no one has any idea why 5 different towns were implicated. The weird part is, a lot of people from these towns remember this news, in fact some even recall being witnesses to the shootings, or having missing relatives who they believe were shot, but the reports were quickly pulled and there is no remaining evidence to substantiate such an event happening. So we don&#039;t know if it was an imagined form of mass hysteria, or a strange coincidence that was intentionally wiped from people&#039;s memories.","time":1491337532,"resto":119496091,"id":"7cPva6co","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119511725,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)16:27:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119509195\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119509195<\/a><br>Show me one experiment where gravity turning matter\/mass into spheres that is repeatable and observable by the human eye.<br><br>Further show me one expirement that actually proves gravity is a force, rather than an &quot;emergent&quot; property of electromagentism as currently described by theoretical physics consensus\/peer reviewed sheeple, who can&#039;t give any real explanation but thousand of descriptions based on mythematical models that go largely unperformed and calculated by the general populace. <br><br><a href=\"#p119509877\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119509877<\/a><br>Pilots fly with an artificial Horizon, pilots let me start the planes as a kid cuz parents were military, the artificial horizon is a pure mechanical gyroscope.<br><br>Next time you fly I urge you to take photos with your phone and draw a line on the horizon.

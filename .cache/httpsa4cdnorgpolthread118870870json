The only way I can stop you from using violence to infringe upon my rights is to use violence in self defense. You dont need a state in order to have laws, its called common law. Private entities can come to an agreement on how to do things, you dont need a state for that. Force can be exerted by private entities just as well as by a state, because a state is nothing more than an entity that has a monopoly on force. The government doesnt give me property rights, it only infringes upon them you fucking idiot. If i go into the woods and work on some piece of land and build a house there, thats my fucking property out to the point where the land hasnt been worked on by me to increase its value. The govt will just swoop in and demand I have permits and that I need to pay such and such fees, etc. You seriously have no idea what you are talking about, you clearly havent even read the most basic explanations of ancapism.","time":1490850781,"resto":118870870,"id":"7lVNnyu+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

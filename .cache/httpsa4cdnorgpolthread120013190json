They just learned last night that they can&#039;t shoot down our Tomahawks in an operational environment, and I&#039;m sure that was a huge reality check for them, as it should have been. Maybe it will temper their future decisions when it comes to choosing friends.<br><br>Trump&#039;s willingness to retaliate against Russian wishes for a just cause, signals a deeper commitment to moral imperatives than I thought possible within Donald J. Trump until last night. But for the first time, I see something happening in Trump that I see happen in every single person that gets close to the actual business of organized human conflict... seeing the dehumanization of war changes you.

Go figure.<br><br>Syria&#039;s chemical weapons program began in the 1970s with weapons and training from Egypt and the Soviet Union, with production of chemical weapons in Syria beginning in the mid-1980s. Prior to September 2013 Syria had not publicly admitted to possessing chemical weapons, although Western intelligence services believed it to hold one of the world&#039;s largest stockpiles.[1] In September 2013, French intelligence put the Syrian stockpile at 1,000 tonnes, including Yperite, VX and &quot;several hundred tonnes of sarin&quot;.[2] At the time, Syria was one of a handful of states which had not ratified the Chemical Weapons Convention. In September 2013, Syria joined the CWC (formally acceding on 14 October), and agreed to the destruction of its weapons, to be supervised by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), as required by the Convention. A joint OPCW-United Nations mission was established to oversee the destruction process. Syria joined OPCW after international condemnation of the August 2013 Ghouta chemical attack, for which Western states held the Syrian government responsible (whilst Syria and Russia held the Syrian rebels of the Syrian civil war responsible) and agreed to the prompt destruction of its chemical weapons. The destruction of Syria&#039;s chemical weapons that the Assad government had decalared was completed by August 2014, yet further disclosures, incomplete documentation, and allegations of withholding part of Syria&#039;s chemical weapons stockpile since mean that serious concerns regarding chemical weapons and related sites in Syria remain.","time":1491595581,"resto":120013190,"id":"PDi+fUfd","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120014327,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)16:07:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120013190\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120013190<\/a><br><br>Assad may have had no moral reservations against gassing civilians but he isn&#039;t a retard.<br><br>I refuse to believe Assad was dumb enough to do this.

Assad just captured Aleppo. He was solidfying control over rebel controlled areas near Homs and Damascus. Next step was Idlib and the war would be over. Six months. Assad was six months from winning the war. Let the Kurds take care of ISIS and give them a piece of land just to piss off the t*rkroaches.

He was maybe 5, a cute little boy with black hair. He was screaming and crying, and one entire half of his face had like 2nd, maybe 3rd degree burns. It was awful. And my response was quite visceral. I had to hide it at the time of course, pretend like nothing was wrong. But all night that night, all I could think about was this poor kid, just like my own little cousins, or my godbrother Travis, or something. Like, who&#039;s looking out for HIM? He&#039;s all alone over there, he&#039;s probably not gonna make it. And even if he does, life as he knows it is over, it will never be the same. And no one cares. And the only thing I could do was pray for him, and cry, man. And that&#039;s what happened to Donald Trump when he saw those pictures of rows of dead toddlers on the ground two days ago. That&#039;s what happens to a person of conscience when they are exposed to the realities of war. And it changed him. Enough to provoke an immediate surgical military retaliation without loss of American lives, designed to erode Bashir Al-Assad&#039;s ability to deliver chemical weapons to civilian targets by air in the future, without creating the power vacuum of regime change. And he brought it off WITHOUT A HITCH in one of the cleanest military operations I&#039;ve seen in my entire life (thank you SECDEF Mattis).<br><br> I&#039;m glad to see that such a transformation was possible within Donald J.

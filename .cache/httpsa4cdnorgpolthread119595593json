The problem is that the republicans are relying on the institutions of the Republic as a crutch. They can&#039;t keep relying on gerrymandering and state lines forever. They have to find a way to claim back a place in mainstream ideological thought, because currently right-leaning ideology is straight up suppressed in our society.

Conservatives have to stop hiding and being so afraid of being labled racist.","time":1491401034,"resto":119595593,"id":"nlaRw5m\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119609198,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)10:05:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119609010\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119609010<\/a><br>While true, they should have at least held a vote on Garland.

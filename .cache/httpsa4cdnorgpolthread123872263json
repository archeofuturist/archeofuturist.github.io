Nationalism in and of itself is not inherently evil. <br><br>2. The right is pro life, and the left is pro abortion. The right is pro death penalty, and a leftist government killed hundreds in unsanctioned airstrikes. <br><br>3.This means literally nothing. Anyone can identify anyone else as an enemy. <br><br>4. Peace through power has been a proven deterrent for decades. Poor leadership has dragged current conflicts on beyond what they should have. <br><br>5. Sexism works both ways as can be proven through privileges granted to both genders <br><br>6. Print and television news media is vastly liberal, with conservative talk radio being the only true outlier of right wing infotainment. <br><br>7. When borders are threatened, national security is a primary concern. <br><br>8. There are literally dozens of religions represented throughout US government nationwide. There was never a state religion like the Church of England, and no religious police monitor people for blasphemous behavior. <br><br>9. Corporations have too much influence on government on both sides. <br><br>10. Free market economy dictates that if you don&#039;t like your job, you can quit. You can ask for more money. You can move to find another job. The government can&#039;t dictate where you work, even while in prison. <br><br>11. Intellectuals and artists are allowed to so whatever they want, and no government agency interferes. There are dozens of grants available for research and artistic expression and artists are regularly hired to decorate government buildings. <br><br>12. The people demand punishments for crimes. Liberals and conservatives fulfill those demands. A conservative started the war on drugs, and a liberal intensified the punishments. <br><br>13. Something that&#039;s practiced in every government throughout history. Leaders want to surround themselves with those they can trust. <br><br>14. Yes, the DNC did fraudulently manipulate the Democratic primaries to ensure Hillary Clinton obtained the nomination.","time":1493787995,"resto":123872263,"id":"waU95Yjb","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123874779,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)01:07:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"A","time":1493788044,"resto":123872263,"id":"gpu5PY8G","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":123876311,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)01:23:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123872263\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123872263<\/a><br>The media is owned and operated by jews so I don&#039;t know what you&#039;re talking about with the idea that somehow fasicts control the media.","time":1493789038,"resto":123872263,"id":"Mtt1eIpy","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123876474,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)01:25:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123874779\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123874779<\/a><br>FUCKING","time":1493789130,"resto":123872263,"id":"G46dAwNw","country":"MY","country_name":"Malaysia"},{"no":123876481,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)01:25:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"leaf\/10","filename":"1492457799454","ext":".gif","w":650,"h":650,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493789137840,"time":1493789137,"md5":"akFT5GcT8J8CnxrysPZC\/g==","fsize":64465,"resto":123872263,"id":"aGi0xb9f","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123876511,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)01:25:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123876474\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123876474<\/a><br>LEAF","time":1493789154,"resto":123872263,"id":"G46dAwNw","country":"MY","country_name":"Malaysia"},{"no":123876756,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)01:27:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123872263\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123872263<\/a><br><br>Antifa are not bad guys lol, they would need to be scary or effective for that.

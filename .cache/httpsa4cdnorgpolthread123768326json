The cotton gin changed that exponentially. So naturally people who owned small cotton farms expanded and for the first time the south was creating its own wealthy elite. Now the fear from the north was that these plantation owners would make so much money that they would keep expanding their enterprises and make manufacturing facilities of their own. So the northern states fearing that they may get cut out of the deal and be left economically crippaled, and are the states that happen have the most power with the federal government. So the federal government raises tariffs on goods coming out of the south, in order to minimize profits for plantation owners in the south. <br><br>Then president James Buchanan is inept, he isn&#039;t exactly complacent with the collusion to cripple the south economically but he does nothing to stop it. In the election of 1859 Abraham Lincoln is running and part of his platform is to keep the tariffs in place or even raise them. 2\/3","time":1493736841,"resto":123768326,"id":"qqDS+3+k","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123775073,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)10:54:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123774000\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123774000<\/a><br>The Southern elites did not want to give up slavery, period.","time":1493736886,"resto":123768326,"id":"H93XmuKg","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123775087,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)10:54:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123774878\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123774878<\/a><br>Still no argument.

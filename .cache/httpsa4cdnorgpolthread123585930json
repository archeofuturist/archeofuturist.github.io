We went to her bedroom and she gently tied me to the frame with her bra and took off her underwear. I didn&#039;t know what was going on and I didn&#039;t have any real sexual attraction to my sister but she got on top of me and slid it in her vagina. She told me that she&#039;d do all the work because I didn&#039;t know how and kinda started jumping up and down on my semi. This scared my penis a bit so it became flaccid and she was tired from all the movement so she kinda just laid on top of me with my penis in her for about thirty minutes before she told me to release. I thought she meant pee because I didn&#039;t know how to ejaculate yet so I peed inside her and then she cancelled her date because she thought sex was gross.

The significance of it is disputed, so I will focus on one core concept: the symbolism behind it. But first we must identify and explore the key components of it.<br>Hinanawi Tenshi is a human child that has ascended to become a celestial being. In Hinduism, she would be called a Siddha or a Deva. In Chinese, it would be refered to as a Tian Xian, or heavenly immortal. In Japanese, it would be using the same kanji characters as in Chinese, being called a Tennin. She is also refered to as an angel, although the role of a heavenly messenger is better suited to her companion Nagae Iku. Regardless of which Oriental cosmology she claims the greatest influence from, Hinanawi Tenshi in Touhou: Scarlet Weather Rhapsody is presented as a roving celestial being that decides to cause mayhem out of childish boredom.<br><br>A corndog on the other hand is simply a sausage coated in a thick layer of cornmeal batter on a stick. It is considered a quintessential part of the American diet, being a cheap combination between convenience and an arguably delicious meal of protein and carbohydrates. It is not a new concept by any means, but it is something that is also unmistakably modern and mundane.<br>Thus this is why \u201cTenshi Eating a Corndog\u201d is so intriguing. Why exactly is a celestial being consuming a corndog, despite having access to the Jade Wine Waterfalls and Immortal Peach Orchards of Heaven? The earthly and celestial is contrasted in an oustanding way.","filename":"t3_2h79yc","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":500,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493621272658,"time":1493621272,"md5":"h6kurKU3ddJZleQ5WYvVuA==","fsize":92338,"resto":123585930,"id":"Dm1bW\/ud","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":123589655,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)02:47:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123589382\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123589382<\/a><br>I just turned 25.

Don&#039;t save for retirement, don&#039;t have kids, if you get married, be damned sure that she won&#039;t divorce you (you really shouldn&#039;t get married).<br><br>Don&#039;t even aspire for higher wages, because that just results in higher taxes.

In the Swami Vivekananda, the concept of infinity is considered blue. Take the air and water, for within the space of our hands, it is colorless, but in a vast quantity it is blue. Tenshi is shown to represent infinity, as she to is of the sky. As to the corndog to her, the Route 66 sign is to the sky. What of the tiny stretch of road to the vastness of the heavens? But without that land, the heavens would not be.<br><br>So as it is, you see the Heavenly consume the Earthly. Not out of pleasure, as we can see from her expression, but of necessity to understand the realm she observes from up high. But we see it as something of joy, for we too know that the divine are as of us. This is perhaps a commentary of the immaturity of Tenshi Hinanwi, who still has a physical body unlike truly enlightened beings. But it could also be a commentary of the unwilligness of humans to see gods (at least the important ones) as anything but in their image and why the gods so often take human form. This is represented even in the game afterwards, Hisoutensoku (Unpercieving of Natural Law). Unlike its predecessor, Gakutensoku (Learning of Natural Law), Hisoutensoku is considered blind to it, as it from a land without logic. In the utter contrast of \u201cTenshi Eating a Corndog\u201d, we see through the eyes of Hisoutensoku.<br>This is the true symbolism behind \u201cTenshi Eating a Corndog\u201d: That our perception is constrained by the laws that invisibly govern over us.

I can safely look at this character every day and say \u201cYup, that\u2019s me\u201d. I can practically see this character every time I look at myself in the mirror. I go outside and people stop me to comment how similar I look and act to this character. I chuckle softly as I\u2019m assured everyday this character is me in every way. I can smile each time I get out of bed every morning knowing that I\u2019ve found my identity with this character and I know my place in this world. It\u2019s really quite funny how similar this character is to me, it\u2019s almost like we\u2019re identical twins. When I first saw this character, I had an existential crisis. What if this character was the real me and I was the fictional being. What if this character actually became aware of my existence? Did this character have the ability to become self aware itself?","filename":"0100_Fascinum_phallischer_Gl-cksbringer_Altes_Museum_Berlin_01_anagoria-1024x835","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":835,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":101,"tim":1493621641905,"time":1493621641,"md5":"mPL4umuBkt\/htk9Y0gsnAA==","fsize":145868,"resto":123585930,"id":"Dm1bW\/ud","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":123590287,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)02:55:43","name":"Anonymous","filename":"flanhang squad in an entirely new political dimension","ext":".png","w":2284,"h":1900,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":103,"tim":1493621743255,"time":1493621743,"md5":"23UByIlp4lNVv5AEqIYBMA==","fsize":993518,"resto":123585930,"id":"YB1VgOij","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":123590308,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)02:56:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;race mixing is wrong<\/span><br><br>You lot disgust me.<br><br>As an avid conoisseur and self-described enthusiast of the oriental female form and soul,I shall not stand and lend my ears to this ludicrousy without taking it as a personal affront.<br><br>Although I have yet to partake in the actual reproductive coital act with a female I have the sufficient and vast body of research under my belt (and growing) to ascertain to the fact of the asian woman&#039;s superiority over her western female counterpart.<br><br>Some of you differ, and ignorantly succumb to the fallacious reasoning of ascribing the western wench as the queen of femmes due to their oversized mammaries, puffed posteriors and mockable and unnecessary curvaceous forms.

My name is Skra and this is my first build.<br><br>I started playing Dark Souls Oct 11, 2016. I wanted to role play this game as a knight for no other reason than I like the way knight armor looks. I realize that there are better defensive options. It seems to me that new players almost always tend to make a Giant Dad and I want to do something different. This build is what I have ended up with.<br><br>While learning this game, I realized that the Claymore has TWO thrust attacks: a one-handed thrust attack and a rolling two-handed thrust attack. So, whether I\u2019m one-handing or two-handing my Claymore, the Leo Ring bonus damage would always be available to me. It occurred to me that the Leo Ring would go with my build nicely considering that I&#039;m fast rolling in medium armor.<br><br>With Charcoal Pine Resin applied and the Leo Ring counter bonus triggered, my one-handed R2 thrust attack does 820 damage against the Cleric in the Darkroot Garden. My two-handed rolling thrust attack does 836 damage against him. The Leo Ring aside, stabbing the Cleric in the back one-handed yields 884 damage, a two-handed backstab yields 901 damage and Riposte is 1048 damage (I used the Cleric for testing because he heals himself). With the Green Blossom and the Grass Crest Shield regenerating my stamina, I rarely find myself unable to use my rolling thrust attack. It&#039;s just always there.<br><br>I&#039;ve read in the forums that the contemporary quality build is 27\/40 because of the two-handed bonus for strength, but I wanted to make certain that my one-handed thrust attack did as much damage as efficiently possible because the damage bonus granted by the Leo Ring is percentage based. Also, since my two-handed thrust attack requires rolling, I had to figure out a way to get my equipment burden below 25% so that I could fast roll without being too squishy because my vitality is so low.<br><br>So, my first build is finished. This is it.

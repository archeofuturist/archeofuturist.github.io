Since this ancient religion is what rules the earth and is what the 1%, NWO, Illuminati etc believes in. Its about worship of the sun and the moon. These two must allways do battle so christianity represents the sun and Islam the moon, this is all by design. The sun also being the son aka jesus, the sun &quot;walks on water&quot;, on easter of december the sun is in front of &quot;the cross constelation&quot; Each age is approxamately 2000 years. We are leaving the age of Phisces represented by Jesus and abundance. Before that was the the age of taurus. Moloch worship and so on- In alot of religions the end of the age was symbolized by the &quot;slaying the bull&quot; mithras etc. In the bible jesus says i will be with you until the end if time, but the greek word for time aeon can mean time but also age, &quot;i will be with you until the end of the age&quot;. The next age is acuarius, the waterbringer. Maybe the NWO is melting the icecaps to bring in floods to worship acuarius.","filename":"247cda88f47dce5e7081a45f89145a47","ext":".jpg","w":736,"h":434,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":73,"tim":1490180720005,"time":1490180720,"md5":"4b2FCDuTbtz63QXKJ4tjtA==","fsize":88629,"resto":117744006,"id":"kBdGfRg3","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":117747863,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)07:06:49","name":"Anonymous","filename":"godmen","ext":".jpg","w":470,"h":585,"tn_w":100,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490180809849,"time":1490180809,"md5":"Eo\/ZD65H+dRqz5XXDlHzUg==","fsize":107236,"resto":117744006,"id":"kBdGfRg3","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":117747883,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)07:07:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117747641\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117747641<\/a><br>por vu<br><br>https:\/\/rayviolet2.blogspot.com\/201<wbr>4\/04\/the-sirius-star-system-ancient<wbr>-egypt.html<br><br>I know its just a blog, but i&#039;d at least glance at the information.<br><br><a href=\"#p117747778\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117747778<\/a><br>watch zeitgeist debunked. zeitgeist religion part eternally BTFO.<br><br>mithra has fuck all to do with jesus, that section is almost totally false<a href=\"#p117747863\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117747863<\/a>","time":1490180829,"resto":117744006,"id":"kc\/iCUdU","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117747903,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)07:07:25","name":"Anonymous","filename":"jesus-vs-horus","ext":".jpg","w":601,"h":720,"tn_w":104,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490180845696,"time":1490180845,"md5":"mnA9RjGvcnRlMpDBioy1ig==","fsize":56500,"resto":117744006,"id":"kBdGfRg3","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":117747939,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)07:08:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117747863\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117747863<\/a><br>neither horus or osiris were of virgin birth and dionysus did not have 12 disciples","time":1490180890,"resto":117744006,"id":"kc\/iCUdU","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117747956,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)07:08:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117746389\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117746389<\/a><br>DNA Shekels","time":1490180913,"resto":117744006,"id":"TkG2GFkl","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":117747987,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)07:08:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117747903\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117747903<\/a><br>prepare to be eternally BTFO<br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=JFI<wbr>6m6Icav4&amp;t=222s","time":1490180936,"resto":117744006,"id":"kc\/iCUdU","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117748012,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)07:09:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117747641\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117747641<\/a><br>you&#039;re right.

Back around 2008-2010 I was a weird mixture of redpilled and fedora-tier shitlib. I was knowledgeable about race and the Jews, but tried my hardest to ignore them and say that only idiots would care about that. I supported universal healthcare, abortion, and gay marriage simply because that would make us more European. I was also a supporter of Globalism to its fullest extent. At the time I simply saw being like Europe as our ideal course of action. Then around 2010 I realized that it was all bullshit. That Europe was degenerate, that Obama was the same as Bush and only had globalist elites in mind with policy, that race was real, that Islam must be destroyed, that my reason for abandoning Christianity was solely to justify my degeneracy, that homosexuality was degenerate and unnatural, and that whites and white values were under attack. Over time I also realized what role the Jews played in all of it. However, I was mostly blackpilled and complacent at the time, escaping into videogames and anime. That changed when Gamergate happened and my last refuge from reality was threatened. From then on I fully embraced the redpill and worked to better myself and the world around me, leaving the NEET world behind. In about 6 years I went from a full-on degenerate globalist shitlib that ironically shilled for communism to a fully redpilled but competent extreme far right person. The only debate left for me is the choice between my libertarian roots or natsoc.

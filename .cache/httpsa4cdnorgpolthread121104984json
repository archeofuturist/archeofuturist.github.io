I&#039;m doing an engineering course trying to get out of the poverty trap in uni and I&#039;m surrounded by these fucking middle class socialists I want to fucking chin every one of them. I&#039;d personally advocate for nationalist economic policies, pro small business but discriminating against faceless corporations like tescos because they are of no benefit to the nation. <br>It pisses me right off when I see the people at my university being all nice to &quot;those most vulnerable in society&quot; ie the underclass. THESE ARE THE PEOPLE IM TRYING TO GET AWAY FROM THATS WHY IM FUCKING HERE YOU STUPID CUNTS. these &quot;vulnerable&quot; people are thick layabouts with no life goals. Also they support Muslims and other foreigners (which to be fair I don&#039;t live I a very Muslim area at all) but when working class people such as myself stand up against it they look down on you like you&#039;re scum of the earth I FUCKING HATE IT SO MUCH. They just live in a fucking bubble I swear.<br><br>I feel like I get on with upper class people much more, I&#039;ve met a few and I don&#039;t judge them for their privilege. (Actual privilege now not white privileges) despite it kind of annoying me. They have very similar views as me and are usually very hard working- genetic traits Iguess (why their parents are rich)<br><br>But middle class\/underclass\/immigrants I fucking hate <br><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;tl;dr I hate the middle class<\/span><br>T.raised Working class, trying to move up in the world","filename":"image","ext":".jpg","w":722,"h":962,"tn_w":187,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492199989238,"time":1492199989,"md5":"MdmX+PSQCVB9YgdigEE8NQ==","fsize":152618,"resto":0,"id":"zqYgLOpm","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"middle-class-hate-thread","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":9,"images":2,"unique_ips":6},{"no":121105205,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)16:01:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121104984\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121104984<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;hurrdurr FUCK MIDDLE CLASS&quot;<\/span><br>I am not gonna even read your drivel, fuck off","filename":"85f036a5ec6443d691ab47edfa324931dd73888bef44c6b5e1fc05d378ce595d","ext":".jpg","w":461,"h":439,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":119,"tim":1492200101635,"time":1492200101,"md5":"fgA1uYmGhTdZ28uPO5TFrw==","fsize":34706,"resto":121104984,"id":"EmhoJzdS","country":"EE","country_name":"Estonia"},{"no":121105363,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)16:03:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"Lower class people talk too loudly, drink too much, swear too much and are often down right rude.<br><br>They also don&#039;t understand they are their own worst enemy and blame everything on other people.","time":1492200188,"resto":121104984,"id":"6HnGxcUX","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":121105376,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)16:03:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;fosters <\/span><br><br>But yea fuck the middle class.

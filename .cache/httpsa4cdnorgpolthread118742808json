The most likely country that hacked the DNC was Russia purely due to the heuristic of Occams Razor. Every other theory is more convoluted. There&#039;s a possibility it was 100% a frameup by the United States or somebody at Crowdstrike. There&#039;s also the possibility it was another state level actor, neither Russia or the US, China would certainly have the capability to do this for example.<br><br>However, the methods they used to &quot;prove&quot; it was Russia were incredibly crude, there are ulterior motives for the US to implicate Russia in the hack, the FBI was literally recently revealed to have the capability to spoof Russia when hacking others, and it&#039;s just very hard generally to prove which country hacked which country.<br><br>Basically the evidence was &quot;the non-government researchers crowdstrike found somebody with Russias MO connecting from Russia servers leaving very blatent Russian references hacked the server&quot;. So out of every country that could have hacked the US, it was probably Russia, but it would really not be very hard for another country that took over one Russian server and knew some Russian hacking techniques and collected some Russian hacking tools to completely spoof Russia. Many state level actors COULD do that.<br><br>It&#039;s incredibly circumstantial evidence that impresses normies because they don&#039;t understand technology.

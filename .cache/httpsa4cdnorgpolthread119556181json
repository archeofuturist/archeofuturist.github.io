They go out, have a campy fun time, it&#039;s great. And they know that they&#039;re still men. <br><br>You can be as gay and feminine as you want, if you were born a man, you&#039;re a man for life. I have no problem with people dressing however they want, but it becomes an unhealthy delusion when you start to believe that you really ARE the costume. There&#039;s a difference between someone who goes to furry conventions and someone who genuinely believes that they&#039;re a wolf in human skin. Just like there&#039;s a difference between a 40-year-old who dresses like a 20-year-old and a 40-year-old who insists that everyone say that they literally are 20 because how they feel trumps scientifically provable fact.<br><br>&#039;Transphobic&#039; is a stupid word. I&#039;m not afraid of people who call themselves &#039;trans&#039;, and I don&#039;t automatically hate them either. Why would I? Unless they&#039;re doing it for attention, it&#039;s just a mental illness. I don&#039;t think that Bulimia is a good thing either, does that make me &quot;Bulimiphobic&quot;? Does that mean I hate people with Bulimia? Can you just slap &quot;-phobic&quot; on the end of anything nowadays to end all discussion on it?<br><br>Bullying, harassing or being violent towards anyone based on how they look is wrong, but that gets lumped in with just speaking your mind.<br><br>TL;DR: This is why Trump got elected.","filename":"the-magnetic-fields-andrew-in-drag-video","ext":".png","w":608,"h":374,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":153,"tim":1491360535001,"time":1491360535,"md5":"USvHheqhIZ3QnB+1+VrkzQ==","fsize":285877,"resto":0,"id":"oHic\/5jh","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"you-know-what-i-miss-crossdressers-men-who-enjoy","country_name":"United States","replies":14,"images":2,"unique_ips":10},{"no":119556580,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)22:52:08","name":"reported","com":"<a href=\"#p119556181\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119556181<\/a><br>Good, less human garbage on the street","time":1491360728,"resto":119556181,"id":"BfkHuG1C","country":"HK","country_name":"Hong Kong"},{"no":119556770,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)22:53:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119556181\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119556181<\/a><br>reminder that if you voted for Trump, you voted for this<br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=4Ir<wbr>E6FMpai8","time":1491360834,"resto":119556181,"id":"LfcfAluh","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119557045,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)22:56:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119556770\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119556770<\/a><br>Sure, but they also voted for this:<br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=MMK<wbr>FIHRpe7I","time":1491360987,"resto":119556181,"id":"oHic\/5jh","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119557287,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)22:58:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;tfw women can wear male clothes but men can&#039;t wear female clothes.<\/span><br><br>They have so many more options god fucking damnit, they can also wear sandals without looking like a faggot.

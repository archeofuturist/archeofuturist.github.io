He makes is deliberately difficult to read his intentions as a political tactic. There is no knowing what he intends until he acts, so everyone has to either wait for him to act (thus surrendering the initiative) or they have to push him in the direction they want (thus revealing their own priorities and intentions). Those are your two options with Trump: be patient and let him lead, or push him to do what you want.

He has 2017 to accomplish enough to appease the American people or things will start getting very ugly over 2018. See, ultimately Trump is just the messenger. It&#039;s the American people who have real power and authority in this country, and they will take action if Trump can&#039;t get things back on track.","time":1491486951,"resto":119743096,"id":"jZOShBai","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

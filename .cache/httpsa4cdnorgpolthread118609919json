It escalated into people selling their collections of Pepe on eBay, with bids reaching up to almost $100,000 before eBay took it down.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;There were never any serious transactions however, with everyone involved enjoying the ironic humour of the situation. More recently, a group of redditors have been \u201ctrading\u201d memes of any shape and size on \/r\/MemeEconomy, attempting to create a stock market in meme popularity. But, it turns out that rare Pepe collecting online is now a serious business.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Sometime last year, an unknown individual began issuing \u201cofficial\u201d rare Pepe trading cards using the Counterparty platform to link them to bitcoin, in an attempt to poke fun at another online trading game called Spells of Genesis. Today, these cards can be exchanged for the equivalent of thousands of US dollars on Counterparty\u2019s decentralised exchange.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;This is due to a creation of artificial scarcity in the cards (as one would expect trading cards to have). Anyone can issue their own rare Pepes, but these are then verified by the official Rare Pepe Foundation, and linked to a certain piece of the bitcoin chain via a practice known as coin colouring. Whomsoever owns that particular bitcoin key address owns the Pepe associated with it. All verified rare Pepes can be viewed in a complete directory of them.<\/span><br><br>http:\/\/www.breitbart.com\/tech\/2017\/<wbr>03\/27\/venezuelans-using-rare-pepes-<wbr>bitcoin-currency\/","filename":"PepeCurrency-640x480","ext":".png","w":640,"h":480,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1490674917398,"time":1490674917,"md5":"8IxGrtTHLumwT1bd\/z\/5bQ==","fsize":172507,"resto":0,"id":"QrzdibPm","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"venezuelans-using-rare-pepes-and-bitcoin-as","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

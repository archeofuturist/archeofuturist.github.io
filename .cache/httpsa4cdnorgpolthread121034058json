The key to survival, satisfaction, and happiness is to have your whole community sharing the same model of reality.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; There is no such thing as anti-propaganda or anti-psyops. The only solution is to have a stronger offense pushing your world view.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; If you aren&#039;t indoctrinating your children into your ideology, someone else is indoctrinating them into theirs.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Humans are not mere individuals. The smallest unit of society is the family. When operating as a family, man and woman work together, people are held accountable, and wealth is conserved for the next generation.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Humans operating as individuals have totally different incentives that lead to degeneracy and sin.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; A shared religion keeps everyone operating on the same model of reality.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; The optimal way to organize families is into communities, then communities into towns, cities, etc.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; The King is to the kingdom as a father is to his family. And just as a family is as good as the people within it, a kingdom is not merely the monarch, it is also all the smaller community structures composing it.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Throne and Altar work together to balance executive power and tradition in the optimal fashion. This is how it was in every civilization since the beginning of time. When we tire of the follies of the 20th century and it&#039;s false abundance and find our backs against the wall again, it will be waiting for us like an old friend.<\/span><br><br>Become worthy. Create and lead small family and social groups. Submit yourselves to higher leaders without pettiness, and then let them submit themselves to even higher. This will bring about the return of the King. When you take your rightful place within the natural hierarchy, you will not feel oppressed or humiliated, for you will know that all those above you are standing upon your shoulders, and that their strength is your strength.","filename":"Duke of Wellington","ext":".jpg","w":2342,"h":3200,"tn_w":182,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492155746947,"time":1492155746,"md5":"l+Egyx00r+Gq+RT+AbCd0w==","fsize":557291,"resto":0,"id":"w5t6mS3o","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"monarchy-is-the-natural-order-of-mankind","country_name":"United States","replies":3,"images":1,"unique_ips":3},{"no":121034349,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)03:46:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121034058\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121034058<\/a><br>One of the better things I&#039;ve read on here recently.

They are problems that we do not face in small scale settings, but rear their heads on larger, civilizational scales. These are the problems of class that the Marxists complain about, the problems of privilege the progressives complain about, oppression, tyranny, etc. Every popular ideology, such as you would find on the typical political spectrum compass, has it&#039;s own complaint and solution, and their solution is often someone else&#039;s complaint.<br><br>There is a third angle, or perhaps 3rd dimension, that they miss out on. These problems are caused by lack of social cohesion, and civilization on a scale beyond what humans can comprehend. We are not designed to process massive scales of humanity, or to comprehend the full plight of others in drastically different situations to our own. And so we attempt to solve these problems by socially engineering blind systems and bureaucracies. And these systems are dumb, blind, and either too indiscriminate or too discriminate.<br><br>In short, I am proposing that we are suffering from an over engineering of society. This is why we must return to the more natural, fractal hierarchy. We must give up the lies of the enlightenment. We cannot achieve equality on a a massive scale because we cannot handle the engineering problems with our mere human minds. It is better to have understanding and familiarity within a smaller community, even if lower in the absolute hierarchy, than to all be equal in a massive sea of mismanagement.<br><br>Just as a computers operating system must be designed with the hardware in mind, so too must human societies be built with human hardware in mind.<br><br>Luckily, we still have the freedom to form our own communities. Let us exercise it while we still can.","filename":"C6jA0-_V0AIsDvf.jpg large","ext":".jpg","w":659,"h":579,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":109,"tim":1492157077691,"time":1492157077,"md5":"4RzZodNk3obK0Ms812imNg==","fsize":107068,"resto":121034058,"id":"w5t6mS3o","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

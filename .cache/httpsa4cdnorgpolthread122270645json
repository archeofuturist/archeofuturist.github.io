Le Pen historically always overperforms her polls unless there is another credible right wing candidate for her votes to go to. There isn&#039;t. I have used a variety of other methods to calculate the other numbers; to be very brief, always remember that Macron&#039;s base is FRAGILE (1\/3 of voters could change minds) and is attracted to Melenchon&#039;s base, where as Fillon has stalled because of Penelopegate, and there is no reason to vote for Hamon as Melenchon becomes the candidate for the Left. <br><br>2nd Round will be 51.43% for Le Pen and 48.51% for Melenchon.

Why would he\/they do that, you ask? Because they support Le Pen AGAINST the commie Melenchon (he wants 100% tax on rich). ALSO, they will have a parliamentary majority, and want to get shit done. THEY CAN GET SHIT DONE WITH LE PEN, BUT NOT WITH MELENCHON. This is crucial to remember.<br><br>This will be the FINAL BLOW. Currently (((polls))) predict the abstention rates of Fillon supporters in a 2nd round Le Pen\/Melenchon to be approximately 50%. (i.e. 50% do not vote at all). Fillon\/his party&#039;s endorsement of Le Pen will reduce this rate to approximately 30%, which results in the 51.43% victory I described above. So, add all these factors in and Le Pen will Make France Great Again. I&#039;m waiting, \/pol\/.

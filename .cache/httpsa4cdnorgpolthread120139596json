Just get another one - after all you can have multiple wives!<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Don&#039;t have to worry about the wife divorcing you and taking your possessions and children because they have no legal authority\/backing to support them.

No more dodging puddles of puke and blood.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;STDs become several hundred times less common due to extramarital sex becoming haram and there is more respect\/maturity towards sexual relations.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Irritating feminists\/trannies\/lefty types are completely and utterly quashed.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Islam promotes unity with your fellow man through religion.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;A close relationship with God is established nationwide.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Wife is taught to respect the husband.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The new political sphere revolves around timeless, unbending religious laws; the left-right dichotomy and the resultant bickering and social division becomes a thing of the past.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Familes become stronger than ever before.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Usury is banned.<\/span><br><br>It seems that all your problems would be solved by a Muslim takeover, no?

There are signs that he is being manipulated and abused by deep state agencies in order to do their bidding such as resignation of Flynn, reducing Bannons role, elevation of Mcmaster, Syria strikes, and the unleashing of the MIC who are the ones manipulating what intelligence he is exposed to<br><br>some of the signs:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;general paranoia, refusal to conduct any kind of diplomacy on WH grounds and preference for much less secure, but familiar grounds (mar-a-lago, Trump Tower)<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;constant loss of train of thought, forgets questions asked of him mid-sentence and often ends up rambling about something else<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;bad short-term and long-term memory, claims to have been in New York and saw Muslims celebrating on 9\/11, claimed we were bombing Iraq during the Syrian tomahawk strike and Afghanistan MOAB strike multiple times<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;repetitious speech patterns, unable to properly complete sentences unless reading from a script<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;general forgetfulness, (not as strong a case) like walking out of a room during an executive order signing, forgetting Paul Ryan&#039;s name, forgetting where Giuliana was when sitting right acrosss from him, forgetting the name of Kim Jong Un<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;extreme fixation on past events, constantly bringing up electoral college win, inauguration turnout even when it&#039;s not relevant <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;mood swings, confrontational behavior, strange stiff body language<\/span><br><br>Many more signs, but you all get the gist, the question becomes:<br><br>How do we get him help? What happens if his condition worsens by 2020? If he&#039;s not all there, we will be the last ones to know, and the shadow government WILL be the ones pulling the strings and using Trump as a figurehead.

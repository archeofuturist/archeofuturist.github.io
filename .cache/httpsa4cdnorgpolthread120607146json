It&#039;s 100% pure fucking bullshit. You&#039;re an animal. Every other animal freeballs naked. <br>What&#039;s that? A &quot;dick&quot; scares you? That&#039;s your fucking problem, you don&#039;t get to drag the rest of us down. <br>A &quot;Vagina&quot; makes you uncomfortable?? Too bad. Your personal issues are not my concern. <br>You don&#039;t get to instill a shameful and negative law and belief system upon the human race because of your own personal &quot;issues&quot;. <br>Don&#039;t give me that &quot;think of the children&quot; shit either, because I&#039;m pretty sure lion cubs aren&#039;t turned on by daddy&#039;s naked lion dick, nor vice versa. <br>&quot;Dicks&quot;, &quot;Vaginas&quot; and &quot;Sex&quot; are actually three totally separate things and concepts. <br>Anyone who says differently is trying to cover up for the fact that they are either 1) inadequate (small dick, small boobs, flabby ugly body) 2) secretly homosexual and ashamed \/ afraid that they might pop a boner around men.<br>Prove me wrong faggots","filename":"e30f2fb83134175fadc53da841a9a4bc","ext":".jpg","w":464,"h":600,"tn_w":193,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491922781255,"time":1491922781,"md5":"+IkP67iGdWpQ+cypNJF5Xg==","fsize":35814,"resto":0,"id":"mmGNfMae","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"redpill-me-on-clothing-pol-why-do-we-need-it","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

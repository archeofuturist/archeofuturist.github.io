There is no norm whatsoever in the<br>Convention that would require States to grant eo ipso a right of asylum. A<br>distinction must be made between non-refoulement and rejection at the border. A State is not required to admit everyone presenting at its border,<br>however, the content of non-refoulement prohibits States from turning away<br>refugees. In order for that State to adequately fulfill its treaty obligations, it<br>must first undertake an examination of the specific individual presenting at<br>the border in order to determine whether or not that person is a refugee and,<br>consequently, whether the rights according to refugees, including nonrefoulement,<br>apply. <br><br>-----<br>So legally it works like this:<br>1.

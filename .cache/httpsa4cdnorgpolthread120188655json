If Trump wanted to show NK and China he wasn&#039;t fucking around at all, he would have done it with words, not with a shitty Missile attack.<br><br>Also if the attack was a way to kill the Russian narrative, good thing the world knows he called them first in order to have them not get hurt in said attack, that way it almost kinda makes the link stronger.<br><br>Not to mention that the Donald Shills are blatantly ignoring how many Neo-Cons were praising this, and the fact that Steve Bannon could be fired and actually replaced by a fucking Jew only a few months into the Administration. If Donald Trump was going to deal with Syria, it would have been with strong talking, and working with Assad and Putin to curbstomb ISIS. Instead the attack yesterday did nothing but give ISIS a moment to have their big attack, since the airport was actually a very important one to fighting ISIS.","filename":"Tap Dancing Doggo","ext":".gif","w":326,"h":315,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":120,"tim":1491696111535,"time":1491696111,"md5":"x9MT5MoJ1DZjS2yPz0JVhw==","fsize":1362489,"resto":120188655,"id":"SNB1HwMw","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120205161,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)20:04:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120204831\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120204831<\/a><br>And that means bombing the roaches not the blue eyed guy who bombs the roaches for a decade and handing powerfull weapons to roaches, just so a bunch of kikes have a good laugh.","time":1491696251,"resto":120188655,"id":"xmgJi4+U","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":120205213,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)20:04:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120189606\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120189606<\/a><br>FAKE NEWS","time":1491696283,"resto":120188655,"id":"\/f1em+HB","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120205252,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)20:05:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120204681\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120204681<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Trump is Benedict Arnold<\/span><br><br>Now you confirmed you are leftist scum.","filename":"1463920611667","ext":".jpg","w":549,"h":376,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":85,"tim":1491696302673,"time":1491696302,"md5":"BlFKiM7cauTZ3cVZBTh\/\/Q==","fsize":50871,"resto":120188655,"id":"VSObHPmN","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120205283,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)20:05:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;businesses promise investment<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;blocked TPP and TTIP<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;began repealing Obamacare<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Car companies already abandoning billion dollars plans and coming back to America<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mexico City Policy that cuts federal funding to organizations that perform abortion internationally<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Federal Hiring Freeze<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Dakota and Keystone XL pipelines approved and must be made of US steel.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;reversing Obama&#039;s executive orders on environment.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;wall being constructed<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;more border and ice agents<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;ending sanctuary cities<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;ends catch and release<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;deputising local police for Deportation control<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;DHS agents given more power to deport illegals<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;total refugee ban for 4 months (on hold)<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;3 month ban on immigration from 7 high risk countries (on hold(<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;To prioritise future refugee applications from those persecuted for their religion - but only if the person is part of a minority religion in their home country<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;5 year ban on becoming lobbyist if you had a government job<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;life time ban on becoming a lobbyist if you worked for a foreign organization<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Obama&#039;s coal regulations repealed through signing legislation<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Obama transgender school ruling overturned<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;De-regulation task force in every executive agency<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Violent Cirme Task Force<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;For every regulation implemented 2 must be repealed<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;235k jobs created in February<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Border crossings down 40%<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Selected Neil Grosuch for the Supreme Court<\/span>","time":1491696320,"resto":120188655,"id":"rpnGGNpX","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120205347,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)20:05:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"Ziocons always win, baby. learn it, live it.","time":1491696353,"resto":120188655,"id":"14xuUvaM","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120205390,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)20:06:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"this is a shareblue thread","time":1491696377,"resto":120188655,"id":"OS6D1+gc","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120205406,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)20:06:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120205252\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120205252<\/a><br>That&#039;s not a rebuttal of anything I said.

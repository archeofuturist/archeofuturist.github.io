But they found nothing.<br><br>Alerted by a fellow searcher who saw what he assumed were two bodies on the ledge, the leader of the rescue team, Madhab Basnet, carefully made his way to the site, using a handmade ladder the rescuers had quickly fashioned. When he reached the ledge, he was shocked when one of the two, an emaciated and badly weakened young man, spoke to him.<br>He said that his girlfriend, Liu Chen Chi, 19, had died three days before.<br><br>\u201cHe said his girlfriend was in a lot of pain and grief,\u201d Mr. Basnet said. \u201cHe said he ate salt and water and that\u2019s how he survived.\u201d<br><br>Every trekking season in Nepal produces tales of physical endurance and heartbreak. They are rarely as extreme, though, as that of Mr. Liang, who was released from the hospital on Monday. He arrived having dropped to 84 pounds from 150 pounds, his hair infested with lice and the flesh of one foot being eaten by maggots. Doctors said he most likely survived because he was able to replenish the salt in his body and drink melted snow.","filename":"ChineseHikerRescued","ext":".jpg","w":2048,"h":1365,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1493803152047,"time":1493803152,"md5":"+K54iJncAzqkHjzw\/7\/6SA==","fsize":366474,"resto":0,"id":"dNa0t7Zz","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"taiwanese-hiker-rescued-alive-girlfriend-dead","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":123894153,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)05:20:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"Sounds like he has a...T<br><br>apei personality.","time":1493803223,"resto":123894079,"id":"zvfgvKyl","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123894632,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)05:28:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;6 weeks eating nothing but salt and water<\/span><br>wtf","time":1493803690,"resto":123894079,"id":"NGb2y2\/Z","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]}

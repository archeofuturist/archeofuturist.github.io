The lower your personal income, the more likely you are a democrat.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;An individual\u2019s likelihood of being a Democrat decreases with every additional dollar he or she earns. Democrats have a huge advantage (63 percent) with voters earning less than $15,000 per year. This advantage carries forward for individuals earning up to $50,000 per year, and then turns in the Republicans\u2019 favor \u2014 with just 36 percent of individuals earning more than $200,000 per year supporting Democrats.

Republican candidates gain a significantly higher percentage of votes from individuals with incomes over $50,000 per year, and the advantage increases along with the income level, to a height of 63 percent of individuals earning $200,000 or more a year supporting Republicans. This level is the direct inverse of individuals earning less than $15,000 a year, who support Democrats at 63 percent and Republicans at only 36 percent.<\/span><br><br>https:\/\/www.debt.org\/faqs\/americans<wbr>-in-debt\/economic-demographics-repu<wbr>blicans\/","filename":"naxy8vkiqli8jguju984","ext":".jpg","w":652,"h":718,"tn_w":113,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493566851328,"time":1493566851,"md5":"sD8RNU715di2dEdrqmEQDw==","fsize":95515,"resto":123488139,"id":"H1NwuQu8","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123489427,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)11:40:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"Why are white boys always losing direct athletic confrontations with black males?","filename":"atjs","ext":".jpg","w":4587,"h":3059,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1493566857880,"time":1493566857,"md5":"J4hARnAbotv2m4lFDhu6rg==","fsize":3037127,"resto":123488139,"id":"s3\/xMLLi","country":"NL","m_img":1,"country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":123489457,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)11:41:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123488963\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123488963<\/a><br>5 to 8 billion is literally nothing","time":1493566878,"resto":123488139,"id":"+9wvGbo0","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123489511,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)11:41:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123488657\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123488657<\/a><br>Without the $20 trillion American economy to bear the burden?","time":1493566918,"resto":123488139,"id":"mS4qL16z","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123489581,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)11:42:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123489427\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123489427<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Unironically posting apefight<\/span><br>White bois dominate real fighting sports like Pro Wrestling.","filename":"1461199984964","ext":".gif","w":200,"h":113,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1493566959075,"time":1493566959,"md5":"zlD\/tulBP5aT9tEia3JXrw==","fsize":1215545,"resto":123488139,"id":"OQ722rqX","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123489598,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)11:42:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123488690\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123488690<\/a><br><br>Does he have a source for that statement?","filename":"1490283685220","ext":".jpg","w":750,"h":774,"tn_w":121,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493566971837,"time":1493566971,"md5":"ILf2ek5AUjbVujPNi3u3dQ==","fsize":109653,"resto":123488139,"id":"mS4qL16z","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123489617,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)11:43:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123489301\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123489301<\/a><br>In hindsight I should have asked myself that, my Iberian friend.

I guess the problem I have with it is that Kelly, Sessions, and anyone else who&#039;s been defending the wall have not mentioned a very simple argument: we have an entire 2,000 mile border that is unprotected (let&#039;s leave out the weak ass fence they cut up with wire cutters, tunnel under, and drive a truck over). <br><br>So I would just love some more reminders to the public to place emphasis on this fact: It&#039;s a WIDE OPEN border in which we can only hope to make a dent in the people crossing. <br><br>I have yet to hear anybody say, &quot;Sure. We can extrapolate that illegal immigration is down, but there are still a flood of people crossing our border. These numbers of detained border crossers does not represent the true number of people crossing into the United States illegally. Think of it this way: ever try to drink water by cupping your hands? That&#039;s what we&#039;re dealing with. The border wall is the only true way to ensure that we have maximum efficiency at our southern border. Another analogy: are you familiar with insulation for windows? Right now we have a shattered old window with missing pieces that has been covered with Saran Wrap and tape. What we NEED is to replace the window with high quality energy efficiency glass with radon gas, weatherstripping, etc. Ever see those energy star ratings on windows that say &#039;This window will save you $145 per year in energy efficiency&#039;? Our wall should have a rating like that. Only, it would calculate the money we would save from the patrols having to go up-and-down our borders maniacally just hoping to catch someone and it would include the number of people that would slip through the cracks and end up taking welfare benefits.&quot; <br><br>I guess my point is that so many leftists think the wall is wasteful, but we have to find a way to get this through their think skulls. That&#039;s why I&#039;d use analogies. I&#039;d keep arguing that way until they starting to see reason. This is about efficiency and it needs be stated as such.","time":1493568918,"resto":123488139,"id":"uVEDhufG","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123493020,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)12:15:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123492707\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123492707<\/a><br>Daaaamn.","filename":"1454718575920","ext":".png","w":253,"h":252,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":124,"tim":1493568940638,"time":1493568940,"md5":"wWaBwcfjpOVwFAMOJOnDSw==","fsize":131972,"resto":123488139,"id":"07oJAA8v","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123493053,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)12:15:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123492802\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123492802<\/a><br>Stop tripfagging.","time":1493568959,"resto":123488139,"id":"V8NfRqvZ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123493076,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)12:16:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123492860\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123492860<\/a><br>Did you know he actually went back in time to research a movie role once?

The lower your personal income, the more likely you are a democrat.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;An individual\u2019s likelihood of being a Democrat decreases with every additional dollar he or she earns. Democrats have a huge advantage (63 percent) with voters earning less than $15,000 per year. This advantage carries forward for individuals earning up to $50,000 per year, and then turns in the Republicans\u2019 favor \u2014 with just 36 percent of individuals earning more than $200,000 per year supporting Democrats.

Republican candidates gain a significantly higher percentage of votes from individuals with incomes over $50,000 per year, and the advantage increases along with the income level, to a height of 63 percent of individuals earning $200,000 or more a year supporting Republicans. This level is the direct inverse of individuals earning less than $15,000 a year, who support Democrats at 63 percent and Republicans at only 36 percent.<\/span><br><br>https:\/\/www.debt.org\/faqs\/americans<wbr>-in-debt\/economic-demographics-repu<wbr>blicans\/","filename":"naxy8vkiqli8jguju984","ext":".jpg","w":652,"h":718,"tn_w":113,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493566851328,"time":1493566851,"md5":"sD8RNU715di2dEdrqmEQDw==","fsize":95515,"resto":123488139,"id":"H1NwuQu8","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123489427,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)11:40:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"Why are white boys always losing direct athletic confrontations with black males?","filename":"atjs","ext":".jpg","w":4587,"h":3059,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1493566857880,"time":1493566857,"md5":"J4hARnAbotv2m4lFDhu6rg==","fsize":3037127,"resto":123488139,"id":"s3\/xMLLi","country":"NL","m_img":1,"country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":123489457,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)11:41:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123488963\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123488963<\/a><br>5 to 8 billion is literally nothing","time":1493566878,"resto":123488139,"id":"+9wvGbo0","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123489511,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)11:41:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123488657\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123488657<\/a><br>Without the $20 trillion American economy to bear the burden?","time":1493566918,"resto":123488139,"id":"mS4qL16z","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123489581,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)11:42:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123489427\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123489427<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Unironically posting apefight<\/span><br>White bois dominate real fighting sports like Pro Wrestling.","filename":"1461199984964","ext":".gif","w":200,"h":113,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1493566959075,"time":1493566959,"md5":"zlD\/tulBP5aT9tEia3JXrw==","fsize":1215545,"resto":123488139,"id":"OQ722rqX","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123489598,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)11:42:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123488690\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123488690<\/a><br><br>Does he have a source for that statement?","filename":"1490283685220","ext":".jpg","w":750,"h":774,"tn_w":121,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493566971837,"time":1493566971,"md5":"ILf2ek5AUjbVujPNi3u3dQ==","fsize":109653,"resto":123488139,"id":"mS4qL16z","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123489617,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)11:43:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123489301\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123489301<\/a><br>In hindsight I should have asked myself that, my Iberian friend.

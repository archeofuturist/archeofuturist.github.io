Learn what you can about the world and how it really works, sure, you need to understand the world to change it. But you also need to reproduce and raise white children to be successful. Once you get established to the point that your family is growing up right, and have your finances in order (bonus points for being independently wealthy) then you need to get into local politics and protect your community from shitty controllers, be they the larger government or social justice warriors.

This is also why you need to be financially stable (no debt, some investments, plenty of savings) before you start, or you&#039;ll be vulnerable to threats to your livelihood.<br><br>But if you got on your local school board or city council, you can prevent the spread of degeneracy to the younger generations which is HUGELY important, or on the city council you can prevent the misappropriation of government funds for SJW causes. Those two positions are probably THE MOST IMPORTANT positions in politics today because if the leftists can&#039;t corrupt the youth or abuse government money to fund their ideology, they will die out.<br><br>Read Gramsci &quot;Long March Through the Institutions&quot; to understand your role in stopping their insidious strategy.","time":1492985962,"resto":122495491,"id":"++wXNRU4","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

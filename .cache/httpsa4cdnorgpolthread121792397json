I&#039;m sure my grandpa has that shit stashed somewhere but making trips to Houston to go to the Italian consulate is a bitch also. With my luck I get down there and there is something wrong with the paperwork. I&#039;m horny to travel though and I really just want it for shits and giggles, might help when I go study abroad too. You never know.<br><br>Other than that maybe if I have 300k laying around when I&#039;m older ill buy a St. Kitts citizenship","filename":"IMG_0942","ext":".jpg","w":3264,"h":2448,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1492578052602,"time":1492578052,"md5":"Wky0wY69w03MnnJgIgt1bA==","fsize":1871293,"resto":121792397,"id":"gSluOOWy","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":121805112,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)01:01:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121802947\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121802947<\/a><br>Hell yeah","filename":"Vlcsnap-2012-12-08-13h11m12s47","ext":".png","w":640,"h":480,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1492578111661,"time":1492578111,"md5":"C7EkUPKYL3zI+dxB8v4C0w==","fsize":258488,"resto":121792397,"id":"Aw6SZsj6","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":121805121,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)01:01:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121800847\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121800847<\/a><br>I hold a dual citizenship with the United states and Serbia , what are you smoking? <br>I think you&#039;re right in that im technically not allowed to do so. <br><a href=\"#p121792397\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121792397<\/a><br>I have a good flat here in serbia, a really nice house in San Francisco, and a weekend house in Croatia.

We just got Jewed, hard. Really fucking hard. The most anyone has ever been Jewed. Think about it: Fucking Donald Trump, of all people, suddenly decides he&#039;s going to run for president, and not only that, he immediately starts spewing \/pol\/-lite rhetoric? That should&#039;ve been the first warning sign, but we were so desperate for another Ron Paul we took the bait hook, line, and sinker. This was (((their))) plan all along. They were aware of meme magic reaching critical mass and how important we would be in the upcoming election, so they played us. They played us and all the traditional Republican voters who were drifting away from the party. Trump pretended to be \/ourguy\/ so we would meme him into office, then he pulls the fucking rug out from under us. I can&#039;t believe I didn&#039;t see it before. They pushed the Russian ties, knowing that would draw us closer to him. They didn&#039;t even need to make him say anything bad about Israel because they knew we would rationalize it away. This was so effective, so convincing, that I don&#039;t even think Hillary was in on it. Nobody but Trump and the Rothschilds knew exactly what was going on here. Holy fucking shit.","filename":"1491402751906","ext":".jpg","w":400,"h":400,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491791290963,"time":1491791290,"md5":"tHFewHrLd+pXiE0qd652Lg==","fsize":36812,"resto":120377930,"id":"cRFpfkho","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":120378062,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)22:28:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"OYVEY!","filename":"IMG_2930","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":784,"tn_w":102,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491791312847,"time":1491791312,"md5":"Wqm2p1fJtX9PhC69V6pfuQ==","fsize":72656,"resto":120377930,"id":"+JFdYqOU","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120378081,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)22:28:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120378018\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120378018<\/a>","filename":"20090520_target_squeeze_toothpaste_2","ext":".jpg","w":300,"h":225,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1491791318711,"time":1491791318,"md5":"j0qTd4kFTLr9H2ahPh\/l5Q==","fsize":51872,"resto":120377930,"id":"CB0YKBzR","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120378088,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)22:28:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;This kills the Drumpftard<\/span>","filename":"NOT AN ARGUMENT","ext":".jpg","w":1200,"h":600,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":62,"tim":1491791321437,"time":1491791321,"md5":"0iQB7p0tFrvPRqHpQY+TiQ==","fsize":322638,"resto":120377930,"id":"G5um2EtA","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":120378095,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)22:28:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120378018\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120378018<\/a><br>fuck off shill","time":1491791326,"resto":120377930,"id":"HgzxBqEe","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120378098,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)22:28:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"Are we still be raided and flooded by r\/MAT and leftypol?","time":1491791327,"resto":120377930,"id":"6hS6Nvxa","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120378108,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)22:28:56","name":"Anonymous","filename":"1475804841318","ext":".jpg","w":1680,"h":1680,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491791336601,"time":1491791336,"md5":"IvAsqRw8jiioVGnY7BEIvw==","fsize":490743,"resto":120377930,"id":"C7jQxxxR","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":120378120,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)22:29:00","name":"Anonymous","filename":"TheCallThatSaved___","ext":".png","w":610,"h":725,"tn_w":105,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491791340963,"time":1491791340,"md5":"ote+3qrq34s6OjW4D3shTg==","fsize":557731,"resto":120377930,"id":"ZBhm5L24","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120378139,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)22:29:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120378062\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120378062<\/a><br>Never thought I&#039;d see the day when Politico blames the jews.","time":1491791349,"resto":120377930,"id":"j8qK7Hwk","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120378148,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)22:29:15","name":"Anonymous","filename":"killdozer maga","ext":".jpg","w":576,"h":338,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":73,"tim":1491791355404,"time":1491791355,"md5":"5NKW0zhxyr5W8F\/dPeCpDw==","fsize":120593,"resto":120377930,"id":"OZ6e\/VQI","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120378168,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)22:29:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"Get out shills.","filename":"1474419293051","ext":".png","w":1001,"h":875,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":109,"tim":1491791365051,"time":1491791365,"md5":"fHuuf2Dyoo\/1dYhxDPTqRQ==","fsize":485976,"resto":120377930,"id":"5aI4uvmS","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120378177,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)22:29:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"Will Trumpcare include accommodations for transgender individuals to transition?

It says we aren&#039;t able to get along with our Mexican brothers and sisters and rather than fighting to unify the Northern Hemisphere through diplomatic and pragmatic reform(aka end the fucking drug war), these losers decided that they want to erect a wall. They are controlled by fear and nothing else.<br><br>Anyways, you should watch Attack on Titan. The first time I watched it 2 years ago I dismissed it, but now that I witness so much coincidence between today and the show, it brings more relevance and forces you to contemplate such a simple structure (though metaphorical currently) and it&#039;s implications on the modern free world...

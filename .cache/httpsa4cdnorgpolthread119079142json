For over 30 years, she lived in the Stockholm suburb of Tensta but says that she no longer feels safe there. She claims Muslim fundamentalists have taken over and she doesn\u2019t feel she can visit the centre of Tensta without being harassed, Swedish broadcaster SVT reports.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;According to Ms. Pekgul, the situation for women in public life in the area has deteriorated over the past several years. She noted that there has been a rise in religious fundamentalism amongst the men in the area, many of whom come from migrant backgrounds. Pekgul attempted to combat the trend by organising coffee shop meetings but soon abandoned the idea.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Aggression toward feminists, in particular, became an issue she said. \u201cThere were rumours that we wanted to take away women\u2019s veils,\u201d she said. \u201cThey said that I should keep myself, and then I did not feel so safe anymore.\u201d<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Dagli now lives in the inner city area of Stockholm and says she is happier that she can wear or say what she wants without fearing for her safety. She said she would consider returning to Husby, but only if the area became safer for her.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Sanandaji, a Kurdish Iranian immigrant, has been slammed by many in Sweden for his new book Mass Challenge which describes the problems Sweden has faced because of mass migration. One library in Stockholm even refused to stock the book accusing it of being racist.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;American filmmaker Ari Horowitz was also attacked in Husby last year during an investigation into Swedish no-go zones.<\/span><br><br>SWEDEN<br><br>YES<br><br>A BASTION OF PROGRESSIVISM AND HUMANITARIANISM","filename":"swedish feminists","ext":".png","w":666,"h":568,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":213,"tim":1490982520020,"time":1490982520,"md5":"ECaYogyDDlL1AfYhgtm2Iw==","fsize":502043,"resto":0,"id":"tOZcDEHH","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"swedish-feminists-flee-suburbs-due-to-islamic","country_name":"Canada","replies":3,"images":1,"unique_ips":4},{"no":119079740,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)13:54:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"imagine my shock","time":1490982860,"resto":119079142,"id":"Xr\/kRUlq","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":119079744,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)13:54:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119079142\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119079142<\/a><br>Great article, and thank you for archiving it. <br><br>The only way to get liberals to understand what minorities are like, is experience.","filename":"Kikebart","ext":".jpg","w":598,"h":633,"tn_w":118,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490982862499,"time":1490982862,"md5":"X\/3lA4rZK0HLDaMmgtTtig==","fsize":309739,"resto":119079142,"id":"e45J1SSW","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119079841,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)13:55:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119079142\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119079142<\/a><br><a href=\"#p119079740\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119079740<\/a><br><a href=\"#p119079744\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119079744<\/a><br><br><br>Those feminists are just bigots","time":1490982911,"resto":119079142,"id":"Pt6ugpDu","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

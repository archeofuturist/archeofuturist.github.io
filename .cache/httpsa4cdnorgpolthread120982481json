It was formed roughly 500 years before the Jews stopped worshiping clay and bronze idols. While the Jews were in Babylonian captivity they intermingled with Zoroastrians and learned their philosophy. Those who would become the first Jewish priests co-opted or stole the core ideas of Zoroastrianism and began worshiping a single god. The god they chose to worship was YHVH, who prior was a god of war, and just one of the many gods the ancient Hebrews worshiped. The Jews naturally perverted the Zoroastrian religion so it would always benefit the Jew. The Jew became the &quot;Chosen Ones&quot; of God and superior to all other men.

He was killed when his teachings became too popular and threatened the Pharisee.<\/span><br>Jesus taught something other than Judaism. Jesus even contradicted Judaism at times. For example, Jesus said: &quot;You have heard it said, &#039;Eye for an eye, tooth for tooth&#039; but I say to turn your cheek.&quot; Eye for an eye is an Old Testament commandment God gave to the Jews, and here he completely goes against it. So what was Jesus teaching? Zoroastrianism. And there&#039;s evidence of this in Scripture. When Jesus was on the cross next to the two thieves, he said to the repentant thief: &quot;Today you will be with me in paradise.&quot; (Luke 23:43). What&#039;s interesting here is that the Jews do not view the afterlife or &quot;Heaven&quot; to be like a paradise. The Jews believe when you die you go to Sheol - a place of darkness that exists literally in the ground. Jesus was revolutionary when he taught about Heaven. So what about &quot;paradise?&quot; The word originates in the Avestan language, which happens to be the holy language Zoroaster used when he wrote the Avesta (basically the Bible of Zoroastrianism). During his final moments, Jesus used an Aryan word to describe a Zoroastrian Heaven.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Jesus&#039; teachings are only useful to the Jew who seeks reformation and the non-Jewish degenerate who seeks salvation for his\/her past ways. Jesus&#039; teachings and the religion based around them are not useful for Aryans, because we do not possess the inherent character flaws the Jew possesses, and of which he needs saving from.<\/span><br>You can argue against this, but Aryans aren&#039;t naturally evil, unlike the Jew and others. We created civilization and discovered the Science -- we could have enslaved the entire world how many times over? But we didn&#039;t. And yet here the Jew is trying. There is nothing about the Aryan that he\/she can&#039;t correct through focused effort, but the Jew is flawed by nature.

The policy defines one form of nuisance as more than two incidents of domestic violence that result in calls to the police within a 180-day period.<br><br>The defendants are accused of using the ordinance to revoke Ms. Watson\u2019s occupancy permit and housing subsidy, and then bar her from living in Maplewood for six months, according to the lawsuit.<br><br>The policy \u201cresulted in significant harms to Ms. Watson, including violation of constitutional rights, loss of her home and long-term housing stability, as well as severe and ongoing emotional suffering and mental anguish,\u201d the lawsuit says. Sandra Park, an A.C.L.U. senior lawyer, said in a phone interview that Ms. Watson was seeking unspecified monetary damages.<br><br>The lawsuit says that in June 2010, Ms. Watson, who was supporting herself with a housing subsidy and disability benefits, started renting her home from a private landlord in Maplewood, a city of about 8,000 people located about seven miles west of St. Louis.<br><br>1\/2","filename":"women","ext":".png","w":1080,"h":1080,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491998494594,"time":1491998494,"md5":"wBc1KPdTDVf73MRHRTw7aA==","fsize":782087,"resto":0,"id":"cainOrFS","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"should-women-be-allowed-to-be-evicted-for-calling","country_name":"United States","replies":16,"images":2,"unique_ips":11},{"no":120747627,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)08:02:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120747560\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120747560<\/a><br><br>The first trouble came in September 2011, when she sought help from the police after her boyfriend, Robert S. Hennings III, broke down the front door and punched her in the face, according to the suit. She called the police again on three other occasions through February 2012, after Mr. Hennings hit, choked, shoved, and argued with her, it says.<br><br>Mr. Hennings was arrested but released after at least three of those encounters, and in August 2012 he was sentenced to 200 days in prison after pleading guilty to domestic assault, court records show.

Green ones were on the topic of Syria and almost all in favour of Assad.<br><br>I want you to take a look at the catalogue now. Guys, we are being shilled right now. Wake up. Assad must not fall. Assad falls and many more refugees will flood the West and destroy Europe. If Assad falls Jihadis will take over just like in Afghanistan (30% in Taliban control again), Lybia (Jihadi council) and Iraq (IS). The last Christians in Syria will flee their homeland. Christianity in the MIddle East would end. Assad protects them and they know it. Christians in Syria do 100% support Assad. Ask your self why? <br><br>Dont give the Pro-War-Shills any more attention.","filename":"photo_2017-04-07_14-06-10","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":681,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":133,"tim":1491566999393,"time":1491566999,"md5":"EyfjtEPR+JjG5nh4YyVY\/g==","fsize":235477,"resto":0,"id":"XImm5e\/S","country":"AT","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"reminder","country_name":"Austria","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

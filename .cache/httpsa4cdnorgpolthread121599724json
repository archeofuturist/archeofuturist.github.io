The French system just doesn&#039;t seem conducive to her win, and France just seems more liberal than most places in the world. Heck, I even thought Britain was WAY more conservative than the states, and I thought Hillary had won for sure.<br><br>That being said, I thought Brexit was a fluke, and I was overwhelmingly surprised by Trump&#039;s victory. So while I&#039;m tempted to just write off Le Pen as a fail, I can&#039;t help but look back and be surprised at the past. On the other other hand, though, Toothpaste land got some nice gains but in the end Geert still didn&#039;t win.<br><br>So I ask the Francs of this board: what&#039;s going on in your country?

You can say a lot of things about the President, but one thing you can not say is he\u2019s not subtle, and I think his tweets tell the story. And the story is, look over there at leaks, and look over there at anything we can claim that the Obama administration did wrong on incidental collection or anything else, but whatever you do, under no circumstances look here at me or at Russia. I think that\u2019s really what\u2019s going on.","time":1491182763,"resto":119273174,"id":"SUenk0d8","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119273756,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)21:29:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;being this triggered.<\/span>","filename":"IMG_7485","ext":".png","w":670,"h":377,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1491182984020,"time":1491182984,"md5":"BRKhNFFCYdtexCFjOVfHNA==","fsize":353419,"resto":119273174,"id":"nbqYmIWc","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119273803,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)21:30:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"I now have an audience in the millions, and they all tell me the same thing: they love me for my insistence on factual accuracy and my refusal to play into the hyperbole seen elsewhere online. My Palmer Report news articles have been posted and shared by Governors, cable news hosts, and members of Congress. In several instances I\u2019ve been the first to report major Trump-Russia stories, through my own digging, which later showed up on cable news.<br><br>I was reporting on Donald Trump\u2019s relationship with Dmitry Rybolovlev long before that name was first spoken by anyone on television. I was reporting on Mike Pence\u2019s email scandal months before it became a mainstream story. I called Mike Flynn\u2019s immunity request before it happened. I reported on the connection between the Trump Tower Russian email server and Betsy DeVos a full month before CNN reported it as \u201cbreaking news.\u201d","time":1491183016,"resto":119273174,"id":"SUenk0d8","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119273846,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)21:30:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"Trump should really authorize the nuking of North Korea to make his enemies fear him.","time":1491183038,"resto":119273174,"id":"NPO3Jgql","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119274000,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)21:32:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"A war with north Korea would be over in less than an hour you absolute tard","time":1491183144,"resto":119273174,"id":"fnlgVV\/V","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119274047,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)21:32:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"the norks have nukes and so much artillery that they can wreck Seoul.<br>on top of that they have fanatical soldiers.<br>dearest leader also has a biological and chemical weapons program.<br>and he&#039;s gonna use them because yolo.<br>the nork midget diesel subs will fuck with the maritime trading routes and might be lucky enough to sink an American vessel.","filename":"1490975945612","ext":".gif","w":265,"h":257,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":121,"tim":1491183178968,"time":1491183178,"md5":"Es\/4xNe6+Z\/JqxHoFnFWQw==","fsize":1863995,"resto":119273174,"id":"Fytfj0Vf","country":"RO","country_name":"Romania"},{"no":119274257,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)21:35:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"The north would strike now if they were smart as the south is in termoil.","time":1491183323,"resto":119273174,"id":"nHRMAj83","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119274379,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)21:36:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119274000\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119274000<\/a><br><br>YEAH, RIGHT!

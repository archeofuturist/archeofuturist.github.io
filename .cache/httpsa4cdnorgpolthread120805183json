He told me that on 4\/8 between about 12am and 3am every authorization from every credit card was denied due to some failure of service, both at his bar and others, customers came in asking if his credit was working. It appeared to him that alot of people were looking for a bar whos credit was working (to keep drinking of course, once bars couldnt charge the drinks stopped for those unfortunate to not have cash. This happened in Houston. This happened to all credit cards too. Friend called but the Banks couldnt or wouldnt tell him why but they were well aware some shit happened. Anybody heard about this happening anywhere else? Posting on \/pol\/ because money control is politcally relevant and this place dunt echo.","filename":"IMG_20161108_185017","ext":".jpg","w":3024,"h":3024,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492029616618,"time":1492029616,"md5":"8Clddm7TfzuLN7YP54Nzmg==","fsize":2585480,"resto":0,"id":"S1L2uuzf","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"credit-card-attack","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":1,"unique_ips":3},{"no":120805827,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)16:45:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120805183\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120805183<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;not keeping a emergency hundo taped to the back of your drivers licence.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;not keeping atleast $40 in your wallet as fuck around money for cash only moments<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;not keeping atleast $1k cash in a contingency stash in your house.<\/span><br><br>Fucking poofty millenial failures.","filename":"IMG_4364","ext":".jpg","w":653,"h":590,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":112,"tim":1492029913064,"time":1492029913,"md5":"NIx58fnyWVH6NXaHiAilPQ==","fsize":90417,"resto":120805183,"id":"1AukzkVs","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120807912,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)16:59:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120805827\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120805827<\/a><br>Wel do that if you single but if you married or old keep more than 1k in a safe spaces that both can acces. <br>If one of you die the inheritance tax will be a pain in the ass and also some countries block the bank accout until its all sorted out.<br>Took like a year for my grandmom to clear all out and the 2 first moths she got any money from our so precius state, luckily she had a mointain of money hiden.","time":1492030768,"resto":120805183,"id":"KjqKTVQ7","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"}]}

You may only be comfortably wealthy vs. rich, depending on ambition and social skills, but you will never be poor. Anyone who says becoming rich (meaning you started poor) is due to luck or using others is literally a fucking communist. Of four close bros (two friends, one actual brother) who grew up poor but were very intelligent, all of us are quite well off. One is worth over thirty-million. He was the poorest and also not the MOST intelligent, but he was the most willing to take risk and go out of his comfort zone. He quit a job making ~$90k in his mid-twenties and started his own business at cutting edge of commercial GPS, which was bought out two years later for fifteen million, plus him making $500k salary in new company. I told him he was crazy at the time, lol. Two of us (most intelligent ones) were always very much into living within our means, so we have very high net worth and nice mid six-figure salaries, while other lives paycheck to paycheck but still makes nice six figures.","time":1493595651,"resto":123534228,"id":"LHFi9fWh","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123545335,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)19:41:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123537206\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123537206<\/a><br>lol &quot;investing&quot; in bitcoin. sell now retard. you will thank me later.","time":1493595662,"resto":123534228,"id":"vKVgsYL9","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":123545641,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)19:43:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123543171\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123543171<\/a><br>reeeeeeeeeeeee why live is right\/","time":1493595803,"resto":123534228,"id":"1+Xi5i8g","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

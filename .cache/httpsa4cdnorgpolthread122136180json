I am student in the Uk capital renting from a group of how shall we say, less than scrupulous landlords. The property has had mice in it, foxes living in an un-used room downstairs for months, excessive rents, and generally not maintained to a high order. <br><br>Now comes the killer, he has moved in so many people that the house cannot cope with the facilities provided. I have confronted him to see if he has a HMO license (house of multiple occupation) and he then verbally threatened my safety and said he was going to evict me illegally. I am obviously not going to take that lying down.<br><br>So I have been building a case of all the things he and his agents have been doing illegally for example, no 24 hours notice before they want to come into the property, trying to access housemates locked rooms when they are not in them, NO FIRE ALARMS (corporate manslaughter if we die from fire), blocked fire escape and of course the fact that 7 people are living in the property (5 on tenancies). <br><br>I have debating if it is morally correct to go through with the action, if I am just justifying my own righteous indignation. Iraq and WMD style, check yourself before you get rekt. Because we are entiled to a rent repayment order for the last 12 months rent if he is convicted.<br><br>So many landlords have there tenants over a barrel and the price of rental in London is insane because of these buy-to-let investors who just want to sqeeze as much money as they can out of poor hard working people that have choice but to accept sub-standard conditions.<br><br>So after he threatened me today, I made a snap decision and called the council and reported him for not having a HMO licence. I felt more confident in doing this because I have secured my new accommodation. <br><br>Now I know he it going to come round next week and kick off, as soon as he finds out he has been reported. All the other housemates are on-side.<br><br>SHOULD I LIVE STREAM THE CONFRONTATION","filename":"4chan slum","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":375,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1492781870086,"time":1492781870,"md5":"iwB8N6jDoi3iH7lfRsdTXA==","fsize":219217,"resto":0,"id":"5oC8adEV","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"help-me-fk-my-slum-landlord-over","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":23,"images":4,"unique_ips":18},{"no":122136873,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)09:45:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"Time for re-appropriation of stolen surplus value comrade.","filename":"7067b2502a80a0bdc331e6091e070a404b7e58c1335a5f549af2f3c33aed2458","ext":".jpg","w":245,"h":267,"tn_w":114,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492782303648,"time":1492782303,"md5":"rLMATAq3lpSWAWDY\/NTzOQ==","fsize":10546,"resto":122136180,"id":"VLlhCyeq","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":122137062,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)09:47:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122136180\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122136180<\/a><br>Contact others affected and together go to a lawyer","time":1492782427,"resto":122136180,"id":"GuSTnbnR","country":"DK","country_name":"Denmark"},{"no":122137140,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)09:48:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"just contact your local furries they will take care of the foxes","time":1492782486,"resto":122136180,"id":"3aRjuXkZ","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":122137191,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)09:48:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"Are you on a lease or do you pay cash?","time":1492782519,"resto":122136180,"id":"N2MrERq7","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122137199,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)09:48:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122136180\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122136180<\/a><br>Talk to lawyer before you chimp","time":1492782528,"resto":122136180,"id":"QoU3dIu9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122137252,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)09:49:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122136180\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122136180<\/a><br><br>Sorry, \/pol\/ loves slum lords.

They stood out as they were acting weird, like they were worried someone was following them. BLS, aka Eric Clanton really caught my eye as he was wearing a new and very bright colored baja hoodie, with black skinny jeans and stylish black shoes. Also he had the same sunglasses and that hairdo that looks like you spent $20 worth of product and an hour in front of the mirror to try and look like you don&#039;t care how you look.<br><br>I had not seen the threads on BLS at this point and had only seem some basic coverage of the fights on youtube. But I remember thinking that these two looked like the stereotype of what you would expect some antifa to look like. I even expected that they were driving the beater volvo station wagon parked in the lot.<br><br>A few minutes later and Eric Clanton walks out and starts off like he is walking across the street all the while scanning the area like he is a dropout from CIA boot camp. He gets right to the street and stops. Turns around and I guess decides the coast is clear. He starts walking back to the DelTaco. When he walks past the car in the pic he bends over like he is going to tie his shoes but then slips into the car. A minute later his bud walks out with the food. He starts to do the same routine but Eric flags him and he scurries over and gets in the car. The pulled out and got on the highway headed towards LA. The car was a new or new&#039;ish silver Mercedes in the GL series and had California plates.<br><br>Honestly if they were not acting like such secret squirrels I would not have noticed them. Anyway, sorry for the long story. A friend sent me the link to the BLS stuff and it rocked me knowing that I had just seen this asshat. Anyway, I hope you guys can use this info to bring some karma to his life.","filename":"bls car","ext":".jpg","w":1920,"h":1180,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":153,"tim":1492717659354,"time":1492717659,"md5":"L7zuveapWqEN850R+gkjhw==","fsize":667741,"resto":0,"id":"NfEx+Xs1","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"bikelockscum-spotted","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":122033418,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)15:51:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"How do I know he&#039;s not \/ourguy\/?","time":1492717872,"resto":122032929,"id":"FsMJs1KM","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

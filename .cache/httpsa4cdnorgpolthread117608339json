It&#039;s heavy shit, that&#039;s why I mentioned &quot;liebestods&quot; earlier. Romantic fiction is replete with people in love dying and suffering because that&#039;s the emotional power that love holds; Feelings are felt through contrasts: happiness, sadness--pain, pleasure--cuteness, defilement. Complex emotions feed off one another and accentuate one another in a way that produces a lot of chemicals that replicate drug highs.<br><br>I think both sexes have the propensity to hold romantic affection in high regard, but men are more often clouded by sex because of our higher libidos. That is to say testosterone doesn&#039;t hinder romantic affection directly but a man may prize sex more than romance because it triggers more dopamine release. Lovey-dovey romance is like a cocaine high, however, and as a guy who walks around with a constant stabbing erection, I can say it rivals orgasmic release and that I feel bad for men who&#039;ve told themselves that they can&#039;t feel it because it&#039;s feminine and they&#039;re stupid horny males who just want sex.","time":1490099480,"resto":117608339,"id":"RX5dgF+R","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117620079,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)08:31:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117611563\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117611563<\/a><br>Liking blue doesn&#039;t make you a boy.

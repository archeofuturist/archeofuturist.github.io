The film included a \u201ccinematic motif\u201d which featured an American Jewish doctor dismembering Iraqis allegedly murdered by American soldiers in order to harvest their organs for Jewish markets. At the time, then-Prime Minister Erdogan not only failed to condemn the film, he justified its production and popularity. His wife, Emine, also attended a gala screening of the film and sat next to the movie\u2019s star.","filename":"1448588037719-0","ext":".jpg","w":460,"h":620,"tn_w":92,"tn_h":124,"tim":1492485006626,"time":1492485006,"md5":"Es5z6Y74WwhGbJaFZ35+lA==","fsize":108551,"resto":121626678,"id":"LRljLYT9","country":"TR","country_name":"Turkey"},{"no":121628986,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)23:11:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121628607\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121628607<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;because they have none?<\/span><br><br>Non-interventionism is a value.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;kek. whats your position on north korea?<\/span><br><br>You can&#039;t possibly compare the two; US tension with NK is caused by the possibility of obtaining nuclear weapons under a hostile regime.

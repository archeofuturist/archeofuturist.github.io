Why do they somehow think that creating scapegoats will solve their problems? Is it fun to be reactionary and hateful? All it ever does is cause more problems in the end. We saw this with the French Revolution. French people were sick of monarchy and the supposed tyranny of their king and the classist system and opted for revolution and radical liberalism. We know how great that turned out. This spread across Europe, and emboldened leftist ideas like secularism, anti religion, and socialism. The age of Enlightenment was a steady revolution against religion, spirituality and traditional values, and many somehow thought that the religious were the problems. Communism is a great example of this.<br><br>The working class Russians created and supported the rise of the far left communist regime of Russia in retaliation against against the Tsarist government that was rightwing. That turned out great. <br><br>When the leftist nonsense didn&#039;t work out so well, the weak minded shifted and supported the far right imperialist and nationalist regimes hoping they&#039;d be the saviors, because they angrily blamed everyone else for their country not being &quot;great.&quot; This led to both World Wars(yes, I know there were other factors in there as well) and caused only ruination and death for Europe.<br><br>Then, in protest to this, The Civil Rights Movement, and Feminism. People took both and decided to go to the extremes with this shit, and now we suffer because of this retardery. What makes us any different than any other fringe group in the end? Some blame the Whites for controlling everything and for their problems, some blame men and &quot;patriarchy,&quot; others blame the Jews, and somehow pointing fingers and going to the opposite extreme is going to work any better than before? What makes us any less toxic to society than any other fringe group?","filename":"philosopher v2","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":500,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493705415406,"time":1493705415,"md5":"mReR5gktGyGGDim50+Aidg==","fsize":29754,"resto":0,"id":"JATO2j4p","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"i-have-been-pondering-lately-pol","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":1,"unique_ips":3},{"no":123736018,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)02:11:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123735904\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123735904<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;the weak minded<\/span><br>You just answered your own question m8","time":1493705505,"resto":123735904,"id":"1DcofOaH","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123736569,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)02:18:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123735904\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123735904<\/a><br>My mother screwed me up pretty hard and it wasn&#039;t until I found this place that I started to understand.<br><br>Aristotle had the answer to your question.

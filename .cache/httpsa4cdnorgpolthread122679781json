Oh, that\u2019s right. The war isn\u2019t even over yet. In fact, it\u2019s only projections. Does not having the lead in armada technology count as a loss? Is that what you\u2019re saying? Because if you\u2019re saying that I can assure you that you\u2019re wrong. Why would you say this when the war is still on? North Korea is still in the war right now and it has been maintaining a strong position in the peninsula for how many years now? He\u2019s going against a bunch of dirty countries and holding his ground while at such a young age. Maybe you should shut the fuck up before you make retarded assumptions like this. You know why? Because you\u2019re going to be embarrassed when North Korea wins and someone quotes you. Oh look at that, the norks just dropped a nuke. Are you a fucking drunk? Are you retarded? Are you autistic? You are a fucking idiot and you should never make a post like this and I\u2019m fucking serious. I almost have a feeling you\u2019re the only guy making all these anti-NK posts because you\u2019re a faggot hater who doesn\u2019t like Kim because he\u2019s hard working to the point of sweating heavily. Fuck you, be good at something in YOUR life and then maybe try to troll people on the internet, like I give a fuck. It\u2019s so easy to spot your posts now, you\u2019re a retard. Always doing stupid shit like this. Why don\u2019t you try to be a good poster??? Just for one? For once in your fucking life try not to make a topic like this. That\u2019s just you, you\u2019re always right at getting it wrong. Fuck you.

The Nazis learned this lesson 70 years ago. A few tiger tanks might win a local engagement, but they won&#039;t turn the tide of the battle when the enemy has total operational superiority.

What&#039;s going to happen is r\/the_dongle will be increasingly exiled with their &quot;civic nationalism&quot; and their head-in-the-sand attitude towards the Jewish Question as they diminish more and more of their credibility. To be honest I&#039;m a little surprised Trump would do as much for the neoconservatives\/neoliberals as give them the scraps from his table but it seems they must have something of importance held over him. <br><br>There&#039;s only two ways this will pan out, one, Trump is just posturing and will strike a deal with Putin, ultimately in line with his campaign rhetoric surrounding Syria or two, he has completely fallen in line with Deep State interests and will escalate the situation to the same logical conclusions as a Hillary presidency: Millions more displaced Muslims flooding into Europe and the destruction of the Syrian government. <br><br>The sheer amount of shilling that took place against Trump during the election and to this day indicates to me that it was not his intention at least originally to fall in line, so I still hold out hope that the former case is true, but I have many doubt. Unfortunately if the latter is true it demonstrates the futility of the democratic process as is the case the world over and vindicates the claims of the fascists and NatSocs, no matter what you vote for you get the same outcome so why bother with the democratic process to begin with","time":1491554756,"resto":119914758,"id":"3Dq1j5pG","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":119916226,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)04:50:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119915114\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119915114<\/a>","filename":"654654654","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":505,"tn_w":123,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491555018814,"time":1491555018,"md5":"IO393TsIMDYKrDn+y8YKFg==","fsize":20378,"resto":119914758,"id":"6kx2bv92","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119917980,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)05:06:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"bump","time":1491556019,"resto":119914758,"id":"LgxOU1rt","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"}]}

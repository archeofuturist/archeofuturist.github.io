The practical upshot of this is that the exposure to new information was nearly identical for most people. Either you read the news paper or you didn&#039;t. That was it. There was one story and you could choose your reaction to it and have different opinions on it but that&#039;s all it was, the one thing. Even moving forward into the age of radio the amount of programs were still limited and often would simply be a vocalization of what was written in the newspaper, with culture and reactions in the news being nonpartisan in order to reach the widest audience possible.<br><br>However if one compares modern or even 90s news to older sources of news, there is pressure to do the exact opposite. As there are so many sources, one has to stand out, and often this means presenting a biased view in order to fully capture one part of an audience rather than having to compete for more than one.<br><br>Thus the birth (at least in the U.S.) of news stations like Fox, MSNBC, etc.<br><br>That is merely an aside of course.<br><br>What is important is that it can be seen clearly that experiences of news alone are drastically different in the past than they are now, and lead to a further spread of culture amongst the population.<br><br>The current state of politics is a great example of this.

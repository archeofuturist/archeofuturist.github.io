Saying that with the Turkish Foreign Minister is a clear message that Ankara and Washington are on the same page for Syria.<br><br>The fact that this came the next day after the operations of the Turks stopped is strange. The Turkish statement mentioned that this was not the end of operations in Syria but a change of strategy.<br><br>This comes 2 days after Rouhani and Putin met and Putin mentioned the positive role of Turkey in Syria.<br><br>This is a very clear message that the US will weaken its support to the kurds.

He wont be able to do that if he keeps supporting the kurds and alienate Turkey towards the Iranian camp over this Kurdish issue.<br><br>He knows that if he needs the Kurds in the future he can always count on them.

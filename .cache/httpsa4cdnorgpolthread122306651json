The main order is that you use SUBTLETY when you tweet though; otherwise the Irish normies are gonna see this shit and go full Destiny autistic screech mode. <br><br>With that said; the hashtag #WeAreIrish has gone THROUGH THE ROOF and has become very successful, the only issue is that many have gone overboard with it resulting in normies easily detecting it. After you see this please remember to be subtle with your redpilling. Despite this; it is still going quite well. As for #TheNewAmerica it is yet to rise and is fresh for the normies; and as a member, newfag redditor or former \/new\/ browser of this board you are still somewhat redpilled and know the importance of a homogenous society.<br><br>This is why #TheNewAmerica has a specific goal to SHAME the Irish into hating multiculturalism; we use subtle redpilling to make them feel bad about being compared to multicultural America which Europeans can&#039;t stand being compared to. Through doing this, we will make the Irish somewhat redpilled on average as they&#039;ll see this and despise the constant comparisons. That&#039;s all, friends.

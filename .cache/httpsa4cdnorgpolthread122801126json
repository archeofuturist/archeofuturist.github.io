The ceremony was performed by Rick Warren at The Entertainment Gathering at the Skirball Cultural Center in Los Angeles. Yo-Yo Ma provided the music.[75] Nye left the relationship seven weeks later when the marriage license was declared invalid.[76] In 2007, Nye received a protective order against Tindall after an incident in which she came onto his property and used herbicide to damage his garden. Tindall admitted this but denied being a threat to him.[77] In 2012, Nye sued Tindall for unpaid attorney&#039;s fees he incurred while he went to court in 2009 to enforce the protective order against Tindall after she allegedly violated it. According to Nye&#039;s court filings, she was ordered to pay these fees and, to date, has not paid any of it.","filename":"1414379574799","ext":".jpg","w":251,"h":242,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":120,"tim":1493164848442,"time":1493164848,"md5":"su4rZBUcqCQiaJzD+i0JYA==","fsize":10976,"resto":122801126,"id":"Ap2nENxE","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122810433,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)20:01:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122809181\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122809181<\/a><br>What&#039;s up with \/pol\/&#039;s hate for Harry Potter.

The writing was dreadful; the book was terrible. As I read, I noticed that every time a character went for a walk, the author wrote instead that the character &quot;stretched his legs.&quot; I began marking on the back of an envelope every time that phrase was repeated. I stopped only after I had marked the envelope several dozen times. I was incredulous. Rowling&#039;s mind is so governed by cliches and dead metaphors that she has no other style of writing.<br><br>But when I wrote that in a newspaper, I was denounced. I was told that children would now read only J.K. Rowling, and I was asked whether that wasn&#039;t, after all, better than reading nothing at all? If Rowling was what it took to make them pick up a book, wasn&#039;t that a good thing?<br><br>It is not. &quot;Harry Potter&quot; will not lead our children on to Kipling&#039;s &quot;Just So Stories&quot; or his &quot;Jungle Book.&quot; It will not lead them to Thurber&#039;s &quot;Thirteen Clocks&quot; or Kenneth Grahame&#039;s &quot;Wind in the Willows&quot; or Lewis Carroll&#039;s &quot;Alice.&quot;<br><br>Later I read a lavish, loving review of Harry Potter by the same Stephen King. He wrote something to the effect of, &quot;If these kids are reading Harry Potter at 11 or 12, then when they get older they will go on to read Stephen King.&quot; And he was quite right. He was not being ironic. When you read &quot;Harry Potter&quot; you are, in fact, trained to read Stephen King.<br><br>Our society and our literature and our culture are being dumbed down, and the causes are very complex. I&#039;m 73 years old. In a lifetime of teaching English, I&#039;ve seen the study of literature debased. There&#039;s very little authentic study of the humanities remaining. My research assistant came to me two years ago saying she&#039;d been in a seminar in which the teacher spent two hours saying that Walt Whitman was a racist. This isn&#039;t even good nonsense.

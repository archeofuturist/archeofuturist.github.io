I apply for at least three positions a week, I&#039;ve had my resume reviewed and edited a couple times, I always write job specific cover letters and even edit the resume sometimes, but nothing has come of it. I&#039;m really starting to lose my shit over this, because I&#039;ve never been out of work this long. I&#039;m getting too old to not have a career started, not sure where to go from here. <br><br>As for the demographic info they ask for, I&#039;ve started checking white hispanic because I&#039;m white and I&#039;m from New Mexico.

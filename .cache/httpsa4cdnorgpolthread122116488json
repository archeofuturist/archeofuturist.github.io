Under pagan Rome, Jews enjoyed full citizen rights, as in most of the pagan world, including Greece, Syria, etc. However, once Christianity became a political power, around the 4-5th centuries, Rome made it illegal for Christian citizens to practice Jewish customs, and even turned many pagan practices into Christian traditions.<br><br>By the turn of the 11th century, most European nations were already Christian and totally different from rabbinic or Talmudic Judaism. In fact, no christian nation has ever historically adapted anything from Judaism. (Which is why I use the term Christian values, not Judeo-Christian, as that never existed). There was no commonality in the practice of these two religions. Even the interpretation of biblical laws were different. In fact, even Jesus himself condemned the Jews of his day and all their unbiblical or extrabiblical laws. Jesus was one of the biggest opponents of &quot;Jews&quot;, which is why they passionately hated him.<br><br>By the 16th century, many European countries already had a history of expelling Jews or making them pay extra fines\/taxes to live there.

They never have been such. But the severity of the climate that prevailed in the northern regions which they inhabited imposed conditions of life which hampered a free development of their creative faculties. If they had come to the fairer climate of the South, with no previous culture whatsoever, and if they acquired the necessary human material--that is to say, men of an inferior race--to serve them as working implements, the cultural faculty dormant in them would have splendidly blossomed forth, as happened in the case of the Greeks, for example. But this primordial creative faculty in cultural things was not solely due to their northern climate. For the Laplanders or the Eskimos would not have become creators of a culture if they were transplanted to the South. No, this wonderful creative faculty is a special gift bestowed on the Aryan, whether it lies dormant in him or becomes active, according as the adverse conditions of nature prevent the active expression of that faculty or favourable circumstances permit it.&quot;<br><br>- Mein Kampf Volume II, Chapter II: The State.","time":1492773227,"resto":122116488,"id":"IQqwMbLY","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122124804,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)07:13:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"there is a reason why christianity has got most of its rituals from pagans at it was very difficult to convert the pagans peacefully.","time":1492773237,"resto":122116488,"id":"1Q53ivmt","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"},{"no":122124836,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)07:14:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122124603\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122124603<\/a><br>Both sides of this discussion are equally fucking retarded.","time":1492773262,"resto":122116488,"id":"Ql56t68o","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":122124845,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)07:14:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122124355\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122124355<\/a><br>So, you&#039;re against paganism then?<br>Because let&#039;s not kid ourselves.

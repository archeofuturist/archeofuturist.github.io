Think about it: Fucking Donald Trump, of all people, suddenly decides he&#039;s going to run for president, and not only that, he immediately starts spewing \/pol\/-lite rhetoric? That should&#039;ve been the first warning sign, but we were so desperate for another Ron Paul we took the bait hook, line, and sinker. This was (((their))) plan all along. They were aware of meme magic reaching critical mass and how important we would be in the upcoming election, so they played us. They played us and all the traditional Republican voters who were drifting away from the party. Trump pretended to be \/ourguy\/ so we would meme him into office, then he pulls the fucking rug out from under us. I can&#039;t believe I didn&#039;t see it before. They pushed the Russian ties, knowing that would draw us closer to him. They didn&#039;t even need to make him say anything bad about Israel because they knew we would rationalize it away. This was so effective, so convincing, that I don&#039;t even think Hillary was in on it. Nobody but Trump and the Rothschilds knew exactly what was going on here. Holy fucking shit.","filename":"1491535443989","ext":".jpg","w":250,"h":250,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491615097449,"time":1491615097,"md5":"UaNdOFQdYgBGWj2qjtHEhg==","fsize":16027,"resto":0,"id":"NfL4z0fE","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"guys-i-get-it-now-we-just-got-jewed-hard-really","country_name":"United States","replies":6,"images":4,"unique_ips":7},{"no":120063427,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)21:34:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"Jared Kushner and Gary Cohn are both registered Democrats.

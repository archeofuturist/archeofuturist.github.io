Now I&#039;m all amped up thinking about the next time I&#039;m in a restaurant how I am going to ask the waitress if she can name just three women under thirty who don&#039;t have these stupid fucking piercings. Then tell her it doesn&#039;t matter because I already lost my appetite looking at her disfigured fucking face. WHAT BUSINESS DO YOU HAVE SERVING FOOD YOU FUCKING FREAK!?

Funny story, I was getting my haircut and every woman cutting hair was your typical tumblrina hamplanet. I couldn&#039;t believe it. Multiple face piercings, multi-colored hair, problem glasses. Anyway, I&#039;m having second thoughts about getting my hair cut here, but it was last minute and best I could do. I luck out and get the smallest of planets, the ham-pluto of you will. No face piercings on this one, very rare. Things are going ok if i don&#039;t look at them, yhen sudden a five wide announces that her lip thing fell off onto the floor somewhere. All productivity ceases immediately. Everybody is looking for her precious filthy mouth metal. I&#039;m fucking dying inside.

Possibly a polite way of saying it looks fucking stupid. I just said it&#039;s crazy how it&#039;s the opposite now and everyone has them and let them know it stands out now when you don&#039;t.

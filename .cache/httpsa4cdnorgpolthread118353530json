He was a follower of Rousseau, the difference being that instead of wanting to return to the status as noble savage, he wanted to go beyond it.<br><br>The problem is, that&#039;s bullshit. Archaeology has shown that things Marx associated with the division of labour caused by changes in material conditions (the Neolithic Revolution and Agriculture) in fact existed in &quot;primitive communistic&quot; societies of hunter-gatherer, like war and religion. Therefore there is no basis to believe any communist society would be a utopia. Hobbes was right, Rousseau was wrong.<br><br>So, realising that, you can deal with two facets Marx ignored in his works: one related to human nature, and the other to the nature of institutions. The will to power and the &quot;Iron Law of Oligarchy&quot;.<br><br>http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Will_t<wbr>o_power<br><br>http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Iron_L<wbr>aw_of_Oligarchy<br><br>Even if you managed to build a perfect society of stateless communism where workers&#039; councils manage all economic production and hold political power, you would still have conflict, because the nature of such councils would mean that they would be controlled by tiny minorities of &quot;organisers&quot;, and the nature of this ruling class would mean they would fight among themselves, whatever the means necessary. And exploitation too, since the same institution having political and economical power never bodes well (one of the few good things about capitalism is that it separates the spheres of political and economical power, no matter how much big business tries to capture the government, they almost always fail).<br><br>So, even when communism works, it doesn&#039;t.","time":1490529879,"resto":118353530,"id":"6drs8G4y","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":118355568,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)08:11:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118353947\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118353947<\/a><br><br>this","time":1490530315,"resto":118353530,"id":"OQXc593J","country":"ID","country_name":"Indonesia"},{"no":118356223,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)08:20:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118353654\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118353654<\/a><br><br>This, thanks based leaf","time":1490530846,"resto":118353530,"id":"pfUCZGd0","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":118356286,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)08:21:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118356223\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118356223<\/a><br><br>haha, totally anon, you&#039;re right!!

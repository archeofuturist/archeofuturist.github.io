That won&#039;t be happening this year, people have finally, slowly realised that they have been played by these fools who don&#039;t care about their constituents whatsoever, they only care about the party where they have a rule that they must not disagree with party policy and must vote the way they are told to vote at all times.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; THE SNP ABSTAINED IN THIS SNAP ELECTION VOTE TODAY.<\/span><br><br>Let&#039;s be honest, anyone expecting a complete wipeout of the SNP will be disappointed. They will still likely have the most seats in Scotland, but if we can get at least ten seats to the other parties, it will be a signal to Sturgeon that enough is enough. She can&#039;t keep on throwing the dummy out and demand separation referendums all the time. <br><br>Even if SNP MPs still win seats, I expect the SNP vote majorities to be massively cut this time.<br><br>We have to do something about these people before they fuck everything up even more.","filename":"snp","ext":".jpg","w":615,"h":410,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1492613241959,"time":1492613241,"md5":"MekkxOelyMAXJZL+cQR5mQ==","fsize":18438,"resto":0,"id":"4zYzjywz","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"general-election-2017-time-to-cut-down-the-snp","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":121852842,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)11:01:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121851266\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121851266<\/a><br>inb4 58\/59 with only shitland and cuckney voting cuckdems as always","time":1492614118,"resto":121851266,"id":"KKiA9Bq\/","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"}]}

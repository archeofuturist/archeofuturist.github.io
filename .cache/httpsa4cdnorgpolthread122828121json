Schools on the coast solicit for students with emailed &#039;Cultural Diversity&#039; and &#039;Safe Standards of Conduct&#039; pamphlets. Schools in the southern or Rustbelt states solicit with their latest modernized science\/health departments and added fields of study that are directly translated to projected job growth. If your soliciting your robust humanities department it would only be logical to assume that you have teachers that know those topics i.e. gender studies, social justice, sociology, interpersonal communications etc. The same would be true, just the inverse, of the schools that promote their science departments.","time":1493182941,"resto":122828121,"id":"0pjIaDhP","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122846129,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)01:04:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122828121\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122828121<\/a><br>The Liberals took over in The Bolshevik Revolution of 1917.

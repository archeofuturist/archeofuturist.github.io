Just look at what happened with Charles Murray. Sure the liberals shouted him down, but they also got him a lot of sympathy. The left seems to be under the impression that all of their problems will go away provided they do enough social engineering. They don&#039;t realize that heavy-handed social engineering of that nature has iatrogenic effects.","time":1493174693,"resto":122828121,"id":"NrkQwYtA","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122831080,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)22:46:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122830835\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122830835<\/a><br><br>Meant for the OP","time":1493174789,"resto":122828121,"id":"uJrKetqz","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122831176,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)22:47:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122829886\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122829886<\/a><br>BMCC?","time":1493174835,"resto":122828121,"id":"NoucwxPW","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122831217,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)22:47:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122830623\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122830623<\/a><br><br>Just look at the dude like he&#039;s batshit crazy, then tell the dude he&#039;s batshit crazy.

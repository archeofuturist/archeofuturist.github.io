The military has been unable to promptly ship the necessary replacement parts to the UN base at Camp Castor in Gao, Mali, where the facilities also aren&#039;t quite up to the German standards for maintenance. <br>&quot;The mission fulfillment vis-a-vis the UN is guaranteed,&quot; a Bundeswehr officer deployed to Mali told the paper. &quot;Operating conditions, however, regularly push us to the technological breaking point.&quot;<br><br>The Bundeswehr&#039;s Tiger combat helicopter, meant to be operational by May 1, has not been cleared to operate in temperatures exceeding 43.26 degrees Celsius, &quot;Die Welt&quot; reported. Daytime temperatures near Gao, in the West African desert, are projected to run 43-45 C for the foreseeable weeks, meaning the Tiger will stay mostly on the ground rather than flying stabilization sorties.","filename":"Screen Shot 2017-04-25 at 11.17.17 PM","ext":".png","w":1410,"h":1158,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":205,"tim":1493155120510,"time":1493155120,"md5":"c4WJVMNMnUOP2IGRphp2hA==","fsize":965402,"resto":0,"id":"T0jmrOL1","country":"DE","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"germany-rising-reaching-2-in-2024-edition","country_name":"Germany","replies":43,"images":7,"unique_ips":21},{"no":122789077,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)17:19:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122789001\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122789001<\/a><br>... and there it goes","filename":"87323414","ext":".jpg","w":810,"h":510,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":78,"tim":1493155153657,"time":1493155153,"md5":"1g7gJ1CnmpAvnRZQvDVAMQ==","fsize":85120,"resto":122789001,"id":"T0jmrOL1","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":122789265,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)17:20:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122789001\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122789001<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;German engineering<\/span><br><br>Overengineered and autistically complicated, such is German engineering.","time":1493155226,"resto":122789001,"id":"jc7o\/wSf","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122789413,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)17:21:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122789001\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122789001<\/a><br>It&#039;s not even summer yet!

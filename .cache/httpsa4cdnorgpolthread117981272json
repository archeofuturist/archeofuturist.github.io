OP if you are what you say you are then you already know there is no point. <br><br>Have you ever seen a person in your community who converted to another religion or simply just said &quot;no I don&#039;t believe in it&quot;? It doesn&#039;t matter if this man was your best friend of 20 years, you don&#039;t talk to him after this. His own mother will never answer his calls again. This is the western equivalent of apostasy laws. They can&#039;t kill you for leaving the religion so lord knows they&#039;ll shun you forever. <br><br>There is no soft and peaceful discussion. It&#039;s there when trying to get someone to join the club, you&#039;ll meet Dr Jekyll but stray from the path and mr Hyde is all you will see. <br><br>IMO the religion is going to come to a flashpoint soon, it can&#039;t go on with the west as it is and either those who believe in it must retreat to their lands (by choice and hopefully not bloodshed) to practice or the religion must reform. Reform is the obvious easy choice, the release of say a New Testament type thing to help make the religion more adapted to modern life. But again if you are what you say you are then you know that if there ever was a religion that will fight a New Testament it&#039;s this one.","time":1490305429,"resto":117981272,"id":"JuDj9JwT","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":117988647,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)17:44:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117981272\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117981272<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Head chopped off by a local sheikh<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;local sheikh<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;British flag<\/span><br><br>The UK is dead.","filename":"560f8ddc3013e1483832a4824ba382d8","ext":".jpg","w":660,"h":503,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":95,"tim":1490305498476,"time":1490305498,"md5":"C9eRbpotdtTwVcaPkj0CfQ==","fsize":128386,"resto":117981272,"id":"f343yGIY","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

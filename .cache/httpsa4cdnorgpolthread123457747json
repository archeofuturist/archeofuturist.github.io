If you mean the system in general, Trump&#039;s complaints are that the system is incredibly slow, which is unquestionably true. As for Obama, you can look at his &quot;I&#039;ve got a pen and I&#039;ve got a phone&quot; comment, where he&#039;s essentially saying that because Congress isn&#039;t playing ball with him he will govern through executive orders. Now that he&#039;s normalized this, it&#039;ll keep going, it&#039;s just the natural decay of a system once its safeguards are subverted.","time":1493545913,"resto":123457747,"id":"xi8BKCD5","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":123462293,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)05:52:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123462087\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123462087<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;retarded to say that<\/span><br>Yup.

Car ownership isn&#039;t as necessary as it is in the USA because public transport is efficient and not nigger tier. <br><br>Funnily enough my car is a the right hand drive version of the 2016 Mustang. My wife owns a Fiat 500. I live in London normally and I can say without a shadow of a doubt the 500 is the better car for a city. The Mustang gets shit mileage in city traffic, is a pain in the arse to park and attracts way too much attention (sick of cunts taking pictures beside it).","time":1492108052,"resto":120936083,"id":"TDq+3znx","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"},{"no":120942663,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)14:27:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120942232\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120942232<\/a><br><br>German cars are incredibly overrated.<br><br>So expensive to work on, parts are a fortune, they&#039;re not nearly as reliable as Japanese cars, and they always over-engineer them","time":1492108053,"resto":120936083,"id":"KFx\/VD6d","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120942721,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)14:28:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120936083\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120936083<\/a><br>Holy fuck OP I was thinking the exact same thing today.

As long people like Milo, Alex Jones and Mark Dice are focusing on converting the impressionable young folks closer to the side of common sense they are good assets to us. &quot;Normal People&quot; need to be spoonfed out of their neo commercialized liberal comas and these are the types of fags whom are aesthetically pleasing to to the poor brainwashed fuckheads. Just let Milo and the rest do their thing and after a few more bad terrorist attacks the vast majority of the public will be so damn sick of being fucked in the ass by the globalists we will have our thousand year reich","filename":"Screen Shot 2017-03-21 at 3.47.14 AM","ext":".png","w":499,"h":342,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":85,"tim":1490327537625,"time":1490327537,"md5":"BIUXncyVeQcG2Ew\/cuSAbQ==","fsize":228239,"resto":118035188,"id":"EIDsqD29","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118036238,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)23:53:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118035452\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118035452<\/a><br>I think you mean if he swallowed a lot less semen","time":1490327590,"resto":118035188,"id":"0mOhEMR5","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118036929,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)23:59:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118035188\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118035188<\/a><br>Unlikely.

The right demanding purity tests is stupid, honestly. Our tactics haven&#039;t worked, we&#039;re better off copying theirs.<br><br>Plus, Milo\/Alt-lite figures muddy the waters for normies.

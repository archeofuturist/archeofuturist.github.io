I dunno desu, I&#039;m in the same boat. Was raised fundamentalist Evangelical, and when I was exposed to even the most meme-y atheist arguments, my &#039;faith&#039; (six day creationism, Biblical inerrancy etc.) collapsed, and I spent a lot of time as an atheist. It took a while, but I also mellowed out, and became an agnostic when I re-examined my philosophical presuppositions. I&#039;ve more recently been warming up to some kind of theism\/deism, and have been re-examining the evidence for Jesus&#039; life, death and resurrection, but I have a lot of difficulty with trusting the Bible, and am pretty cynical with regards to churches. <br>But, otoh, I don&#039;t really see another option for where I can find <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; a wife who is less likely to divorce rape me <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; a healthy community to raise white kids <\/span><br>I&#039;ve been looking into the Catholic church, but they seem to have their own issues, and Protestants are cancer-tier.","filename":"Thinker","ext":".jpg","w":900,"h":1200,"tn_w":93,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491961796684,"time":1491961796,"md5":"ggRdFXdnsZSF7qtj94SNJQ==","fsize":986603,"resto":120694200,"id":"7lNASb09","country":"CA","m_img":1,"country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120695454,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)21:53:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120694200\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120694200<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;April 10th 1988<\/span><br><br>Two days before I was born.

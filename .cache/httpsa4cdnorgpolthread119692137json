The early Warring States Period of them 6th c. BCE saw the construction of the first crossbows more than a century before they were ever mentioned by the Ancient Greeks. While the rest of the world was using papyrus, clay tablets, or vellum paper was invented and put into wide use in the 2nd c. CE - produced to cheaply that China was using toilet paper centuries before anyone in Europe had ever heard of the material. At least ostensibly it wouldn&#039;t he until the Battle of the Talas River in 751 CE that the Arabs would &quot;steal&quot; the secret of papermaking. Block printing and moveable-typeface logically followed in late Tang, sometime prior to the 868 printed publication of the \u91d1\u525b\u7d93 (Diamond Sutra). Paper money also, with experiments as easly as the mid-Tang and it really being rolled out during the Mongol Yuan Dynasty of the 13th and 14th centuries. Both the magnetic compass and weaponized gunpowder are also claimed by the Chinese, invented during the Song Dynasty. The compass, of course, would prove fundamental to the great Chinese voyages of exploration and trade under Admiral Zheng He in the early Ming Dynasty, while gunpowder would prove so formidable that the Song would drag the Mongol conquest of China out until from 1232 to 1276 - a truly stunning amount of time, given that the conquest of Kievan Rus took them 3 years (1237-40), Bulgaria took them a year (41-42), Anatolia in a year (1243), the Abbasid Caliphate another year (1258), and would prove the only nation targeted by Genghis personally that he did not see through to completion or near-completion. Speaking of the Mongols, they do what no one managed to do before of since - politically and economically unite almost the entirity of Asia through force of arms. Alexander, the Caesars, and Napoleon have got nothing on the Khans.","filename":"among other reasons","ext":".jpg","w":975,"h":672,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":172,"tim":1491445784153,"time":1491445784,"md5":"rqwN4DJ2XS0ICd4r729Y8w==","fsize":73472,"resto":0,"id":"GeWSz9+y","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"by-virtually-every-technological-marker-save-the","country_name":"United States","replies":8,"images":3,"unique_ips":7},{"no":119692237,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)22:30:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"Chinese civilization would impact other East Asian peoples in a way so fundamental that it dwarfs the relatively surface-level changes wrought by Westernization and so-called &quot;secular democracy.&quot; Under the t-shirts, jeans, and pop music in Korea, Japan, China, etc and you&#039;ll find the same underlying skeleton of civilization that has existed for thousands of year - Daoist, Confucian, and Mahayana Buddhist traditions that are the underpinnings of all of those civilizations - filial piety, valuation of collectivism vs. individualism, high-order societies, a reverence for the past, and a worldview that is on many levels fundamentally circular rather than straight.<br><br>The fact of the matter is by the time to &quot;West&quot; managed to turn its attention to the grat and ancient civilizations of East Asia, it had just so happened to do so at the one, single historical moment that they had eclipsed the East technologically.

Moreover the collective, selective amnesia of the West has strongly tended to do the opposite of the claims presented in the question - glorifying its own achievements and either minimizing, downplaying, or appropriating the developments and mile-markers achieved by other civilizations (see: Gutenberg &quot;inventing&quot; the printing press...) It conveniently forgets that, while it has gained at least temporary ascendency, it&#039;s only been in the past couple of centuries that anyone would think that the West was superior in any way... and for the vast stretch of human history, Europe has been a third-rate, backwards sewage ditch utterly eclipsed by its eastern neighbors, both near and distant.","filename":"vdAycwP","ext":".png","w":442,"h":284,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":80,"tim":1491445839119,"time":1491445839,"md5":"5lBB25ufPG2fJODAv12pxg==","fsize":107934,"resto":119692137,"id":"GeWSz9+y","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119692341,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)22:31:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"Finally, in terms of stability and civilization, it is highly, highly questionable that either of those would register positively on East Asian civlizations when the whole is taken into account.

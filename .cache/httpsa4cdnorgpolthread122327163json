She knows immigration is bad for france, that africans are low-IQ and unable to bear civilization, that traditions and our cultural heritage matters. Since the election is approaching I conducted an experiment and told her I wouldn&#039;t vote in this election cycle, but rather that she could choose for me. I didn&#039;t influence her too much in her choice and tonight she gave me her answer <br><br>She wants to vote for Emmanuel fucking Macron.

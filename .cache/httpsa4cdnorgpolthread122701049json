Climate change for example, there are practically zero peer reviewed studies not funded by a fossil fuel company that would agree with the notion that climate change is not real or not man made. If you found a legitimate peer reviewed study with full transparency on where their data set comes from then you would likely elicit a different response from a professor or whoever you are addressing as being the &quot;killers of science&quot; or whatever else you&#039;re trying to point out. The scientific community has already gone through the motions of testing and verifying that climate change works as typically stated to from Nye for example. Their response to all of this misinformation is one of extreme frustration, not one of malevolence. You can trace the paper trail back to big oil if you wanted from most of the studies which would indicate otherwise on climate change.<br><br>In regards to Gender Science, Bill Nye is challenging the previously understood concepts of how Gender and Sex may operate within the human body. Regardless of whether he is right or wrong, it would be contradictory for you to say that we should ignore him or label him as a peddler of pseudo-science because he&#039;s going against a paradigm which previously appeared as already set in stone. You never clearly cited how he&#039;s destroying science (I might&#039;ve missed it sorry, <br> haven&#039;t slept in over a day) but in regards to how you seem to be concluding here, it would be good if you waited to see what future studies may yield in regards to gender\/sex. Bill Nye is not the representative of the entire science community and it would be dangerous to say that we should reject scientific research in the future just off of the notion that Bill Nye has seriously fallen off.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;there are no absolute truths or absolute lies.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;There are facts and our existence isn\u2019t subjective but objective<\/span>","time":1493116657,"resto":122701049,"id":"b+x2neTo","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122720813,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)06:39:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122704312\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122704312<\/a><br>some oc for future memeposting desu","filename":"whydiditcometothisbill","ext":".png","w":1200,"h":658,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":68,"tim":1493116761733,"time":1493116761,"md5":"fnfV8y5hjgeEMZt7+GSVHQ==","fsize":565196,"resto":122701049,"id":"rxwaBBLw","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":122720954,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)06:41:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122716120\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122716120<\/a><br>yea man, i dont knwo what the date is on this<br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=RWo<wbr>xUvWHtB4<br>70&#039;s.","filename":"zappa","ext":".jpg","w":636,"h":421,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":82,"tim":1493116877247,"time":1493116877,"md5":"FT0+Pij1Xgc1ilnK6vP6Ag==","fsize":52453,"resto":122701049,"id":"ZvJN8J\/V","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122721110,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)06:43:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122720707\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122720707<\/a><br>fuck you asshole<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;we dont understand <\/span><br>fuck you<br><br>s h i l l <br>h<br>i<br>l<br>l<br>NIGGER","time":1493117031,"resto":122701049,"id":"ZvJN8J\/V","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122721234,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)06:45:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122711119\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122711119<\/a><br>moon rockets can be used to fuck Muhammad with enough imagination, friend","filename":"Exterminatus_of_Matar","ext":".gif","w":320,"h":180,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1493117149269,"time":1493117149,"md5":"5UO1Z+kNk7MhUrFN0ulQ7w==","fsize":1409945,"resto":122701049,"id":"6zXFdGd\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122721430,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)06:48:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122721110\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122721110<\/a><br>That wasn&#039;t my point at all.

Gender doesn\u2019t exist, only Sex. Gender as a concept started thanks to Dr John Money who developed an experiment on to twin brothers where one of the brothers had sex change surgery at an early age after a circumcision went terribly wrong on his genitals. He tried to prove than \u201cgender\u201d was a \u201cSocial Construct\u201d but ultimately the twin brother that got turned into a she against his will committed suicide because he never felt as a woman despite being told all his life he was one. The other brother eventually committed suicide as well as a protest over the terrible experiment that killed his brother. Sex is only presented as male and female both in nature and on human beings. Just because a few human beings are born with deformities or because some animals can reproduce asexually or are hermaphrodites does not demonstrate there is more than two sexes; but only that there are more than one viable way for reproduction in the natural world. You need a man and a woman to reproduce; therefore there are only two sexes.

In the case that I think you&#039;re talking about, which is the video from earlier in the thread, his speech on stage was supposed to be informational and targeted at the general public. I think you went into the video with the wrong idea in mind for what you should be expecting. It&#039;s not like he went into some science conference and started playing some shitty music and masturbating about how true his opinion is and that the science is set in stone without citing anything. This specific setting was not one where you&#039;d typically see him citing numerous studies on the subject but rather give an overview\/synthesis on what they might imply. <br><br>To maybe address your opinions though, i&#039;ll make a couple of points in response to the John Money case. Firstly, this experiment is heavily criticized from all sides of the science community, really nobody accepts what he did as moral or justified. Secondly, you have to look at the broader picture instead of just the truly unfortunate case of the child who was forced into a female body. Gender identity cannot be forced on someone, and I think that is something we can both agree on. Now, what my opinion is, is that in the case of the child who was forced into a female body, they most likely identified as being of the male gender. (seeing as that they killed themselves after being forced into the female gender) -cont-","time":1493119453,"resto":122701049,"id":"b+x2neTo","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122723849,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)07:24:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122701049\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122701049<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I&#039;m a skeptic, question eveything<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;DONT BE SKEPTICAL OF SETTLED SCIENCE OMG YOU REDNECK CONSERVATIVE WHITE MORONS<\/span><br><br>what did bill nye &quot;the handjob guy&quot; mean by this?","time":1493119453,"resto":122701049,"id":"TBu2KFPU","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"},{"no":122723865,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)07:24:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122704312\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122704312<\/a><br>Bill Nye is on a spectrum, if ya catch my drift.","time":1493119466,"resto":122701049,"id":"HEqkmUgI","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":122723900,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)07:24:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122701049\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122701049<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Bill Nye the &quot;im not a scientist&quot; guy.<\/span>","time":1493119496,"resto":122701049,"id":"ZfordCv9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122724026,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)07:26:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122723155\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122723155<\/a><br>Nice nice.

Men will behave like men and women like women. All men behave very similarly and all women behave very similarly according to their biology, psychology and neurology. If you give estrogen to a child or even an adult their mind will work differently over time and like that of a woman, sure. But this would be done unnaturally to begin with, and with estrogen being more commonly available in food is no surprise it has affected the psychology and even the biology of men in recent years.

Climate change for example, there are practically zero peer reviewed studies not funded by a fossil fuel company that would agree with the notion that climate change is not real or not man made. If you found a legitimate peer reviewed study with full transparency on where their data set comes from then you would likely elicit a different response from a professor or whoever you are addressing as being the &quot;killers of science&quot; or whatever else you&#039;re trying to point out. The scientific community has already gone through the motions of testing and verifying that climate change works as typically stated to from Nye for example. Their response to all of this misinformation is one of extreme frustration, not one of malevolence. You can trace the paper trail back to big oil if you wanted from most of the studies which would indicate otherwise on climate change.<br><br>In regards to Gender Science, Bill Nye is challenging the previously understood concepts of how Gender and Sex may operate within the human body. Regardless of whether he is right or wrong, it would be contradictory for you to say that we should ignore him or label him as a peddler of pseudo-science because he&#039;s going against a paradigm which previously appeared as already set in stone. You never clearly cited how he&#039;s destroying science (I might&#039;ve missed it sorry, <br> haven&#039;t slept in over a day) but in regards to how you seem to be concluding here, it would be good if you waited to see what future studies may yield in regards to gender\/sex. Bill Nye is not the representative of the entire science community and it would be dangerous to say that we should reject scientific research in the future just off of the notion that Bill Nye has seriously fallen off.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;there are no absolute truths or absolute lies.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;There are facts and our existence isn\u2019t subjective but objective<\/span>","time":1493116657,"resto":122701049,"id":"b+x2neTo","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122720813,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)06:39:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122704312\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122704312<\/a><br>some oc for future memeposting desu","filename":"whydiditcometothisbill","ext":".png","w":1200,"h":658,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":68,"tim":1493116761733,"time":1493116761,"md5":"fnfV8y5hjgeEMZt7+GSVHQ==","fsize":565196,"resto":122701049,"id":"rxwaBBLw","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":122720954,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)06:41:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122716120\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122716120<\/a><br>yea man, i dont knwo what the date is on this<br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=RWo<wbr>xUvWHtB4<br>70&#039;s.","filename":"zappa","ext":".jpg","w":636,"h":421,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":82,"tim":1493116877247,"time":1493116877,"md5":"FT0+Pij1Xgc1ilnK6vP6Ag==","fsize":52453,"resto":122701049,"id":"ZvJN8J\/V","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122721110,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)06:43:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122720707\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122720707<\/a><br>fuck you asshole<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;we dont understand <\/span><br>fuck you<br><br>s h i l l <br>h<br>i<br>l<br>l<br>NIGGER","time":1493117031,"resto":122701049,"id":"ZvJN8J\/V","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

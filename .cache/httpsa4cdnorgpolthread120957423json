I don&#039;t want him gone because he&#039;s obviously redpilled, but all we&#039;ve heard that he&#039;s done so far is the Muslim ban, and regardless of whether or not the first attempt was sloppily written (I&#039;m not a lawyer so I don&#039;t know) it was still bad strategy putting it out there without a conservative majority on the supreme court.<br><br>Furthermore, I am not really sure if trump NEEDS this guy in order to enact an alt right agenda. There&#039;s a video of Trump from a couple years ago giving a room full of conservatives a speech and he tells them that Mexicans (these people are his words, kek) are never going to vote for you. So it seems he&#039;s redpilled on race and what&#039;s happening to whites all by himself without needing bannon feeding him redpills. If that&#039;s true then all bannon is really there for is ENACTING the agenda, and like I said before he&#039;s already botched that once and the administration is barely 4 months old.","time":1492115336,"resto":120957423,"id":"q0mqBAst","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

I don&#039;t want him gone because he&#039;s obviously redpilled, but all we&#039;ve heard that he&#039;s done so far is the Muslim ban, and regardless of whether or not the first attempt was sloppily written (I&#039;m not a lawyer so I don&#039;t know) it was still bad strategy putting it out there without a conservative majority on the supreme court.<br><br>Furthermore, I am not really sure if trump NEEDS this guy in order to enact an alt right agenda. There&#039;s a video of Trump from a couple years ago giving a room full of conservatives a speech and he tells them that Mexicans (these people are his words, kek) are never going to vote for you. So it seems he&#039;s redpilled on race and what&#039;s happening to whites all by himself without needing bannon feeding him redpills. If that&#039;s true then all bannon is really there for is ENACTING the agenda, and like I said before he&#039;s already botched that once and the administration is barely 4 months old.","time":1492115336,"resto":120957423,"id":"q0mqBAst","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120959180,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)16:33:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120957423\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120957423<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;oy vey that is one very bad goy, he didn&#039;t want to fight for israel<\/span>","time":1492115606,"resto":120957423,"id":"JkBm3ln0","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":120959678,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)16:37:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120958607\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120958607<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;If that&#039;s true then all bannon is really there for is ENACTING the agenda, and like I said before he&#039;s already botched that once and the administration is barely 4 months old<\/span><br><br>That&#039;s exactly what I&#039;m saying and people call me a shill for pointing it out.

And then he starts infights with other administration members for no reason, all he seems to be achieving is giving the media new opportunities to shit on Trump.

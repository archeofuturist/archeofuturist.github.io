Instead, some screech over the &quot;heartbreaking&quot; story he gave to the normies and ran to Assad and Putin like fucking traitorous women. Assad has already gased children of his nation, so he&#039;s a faggot. Putin is a fucking commie who lets the Jewish oligarchy, mafia, and drug dealers destroy his country while he peacocks with wanks like Kadyrov. We knew Trump would operate militarily using surprise attacks. Again, the storm\/altright weenies show themselvess to be the biggest faggots of the board.","filename":"9812311-wladimir-putin-w-mundurze-kgb","ext":".jpg","w":635,"h":1000,"tn_w":158,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492046496971,"time":1492046496,"md5":"rhTXBNUGcUU7i1BbTq1JOA==","fsize":41568,"resto":0,"id":"ulTwLf9x","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"some-of-us-couldnt-give-trump-48-hours-to-see-the","country_name":"United States","replies":15,"images":5,"unique_ips":11},{"no":120844735,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)21:23:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;&gt;T_D<\/span>","time":1492046590,"resto":120844550,"id":"ls1Takd7","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120844808,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)21:23:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"Today OP was not a faggot <br><br>Also, China and the US will take on Russia, Xi has Trumps back.<br><br>bad luck Russia, Iran, Hezbollah.","time":1492046618,"resto":120844550,"id":"YNaAjCto","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120844856,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)21:24:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120844550\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120844550<\/a>","filename":"17759875_10154569311772149_3200994816122532644_n","ext":".jpg","w":480,"h":587,"tn_w":102,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492046642791,"time":1492046642,"md5":"mYH7R\/EjuQm\/bVGP5rkT9A==","fsize":34847,"resto":120844550,"id":"LMNNnuAi","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120845014,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)21:25:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"There was no value in striking Syria, it was purely a move appeasing Israel and the kiked up deep state.

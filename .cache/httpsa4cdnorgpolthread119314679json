The memes that are most effective at trolling become memes. The shit gets posted all day, in similar formats, because they&#039;re trolling you. Often people will add shit to the images, titles like SHAREBLUE SAMPLE or random garble to their posts (which is actually copypasta) that makes it look like they&#039;re using a script that went haywire or are using images they didn&#039;t gather from 4chan.<br><br>There is a reason for people to waste their time posting &quot;omg drumpfb btfo&quot; threads, people find it really really funny when they troll somebody so hard they are not just butthurt and mad, but actually driven into a state of paranoia. It makes them feel smart. It&#039;s what neets with more of a psychopathic streak do. The same people that do this are often skeptical shills exist, or at least to the extent 4chan says, and they want to expose those that complain about shills by trolling them into thinking that they&#039;re a shill. Since they know they&#039;re not a shill, the fact you call them shills makes them feel smarter than you, because you fell for their trick.<br><br>It&#039;s a big collective inside joke, and you&#039;re the butt of it. You&#039;ll see people literally posting the same string of text or image 10 times in a thread all with unique accounts. Looking quickly, I see over 6698 hits for &quot;rural and sururban&quot;. Do you think shills attempting to influence you are repeating the same copypasta about 7000 times, or do you think it&#039;s trolls? It&#039;s an attempt to drive you crazy by using your overdeveloped sense of pattern recognition to bait you into seeing shills everywhere.

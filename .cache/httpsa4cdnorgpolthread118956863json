This was then grown in human tissue, which turned into a virus that affected the human body in a way that dismantled the immune system. We call it AIDS.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Bovine-visna virus has the exact same shape as the AIDS virus;<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;it has the same molecular weight; <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;it has the exact same genetic structure in a sense; <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;it has the exact same Magnesium dependency, which is relatively unique in this class of agents;<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;it had the exact same capability of killing T-cells selectively; and yet, <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;in the cumulative knowledge of the world\u2019s AIDS experts, this virus didn\u2019t exist.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u201cWhat we think happened was that... in 1972 we produced a group of viruses that will cause cancer in the laboratories around the world and then, in our opinion, these viruses were probably tested. We think they were tested in large populations in Africa, which explains how you get three hundred million Africans probably infected today. <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The epidemic in Africa would not have started from a single-point infection. In other words, the numbers infected are so great that there had to be a mass inoculation at some point in the mid-1970s. What we think really happened was a group of scientists went to Africa and actually tested these agents there.<\/span>","filename":"Screen Shot 2017-03-30 at 3.30.23 PM","ext":".png","w":834,"h":558,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":167,"tim":1490902250617,"time":1490902250,"md5":"KMz7ZD88gLC5UaN4PgQ4yQ==","fsize":1000883,"resto":0,"id":"IFiNAgoD","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"redpill-me-on-aids","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":1},{"no":118956905,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)15:31:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;The initial spread of AIDS in the United States tallies exactly with a US Government vaccine study on Hepatitis B which involved young, white male homosexuals between the ages of twenty and forty.

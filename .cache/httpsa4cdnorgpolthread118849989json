Part of their response was to diversify the city economy. This is what led to the creation of the &quot;I NY&quot; campaign, which has basically been the most successful tourist campaign in world history. A lot of city money has been put into subsidizing film and TV production, so huge amounts of that happens in NYC. Broadway is thriving again. Higher education keeps expanding. Real estate is booming because Blomberg encouraged international billionaires to park their money in empty apartments in billionaires row (though much of the money still ends up in NYC). And the most technologically dependent world financial markets become, the more they rely on top physical infrastructure and on proximity to main servers (on this, read Saskia Sassen on global cities and Michael Lewis&#039;s Flash Boys). Technology means that we rely more on big cities now than we ever did in the past and will continue to do so. It&#039;s fine if you still want to be a farmer in Montana, but mega-cities are increasingly where the main action and productivity of humanity will be located.","time":1490834622,"resto":118849989,"id":"yysVXFrS","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":118858382,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)20:43:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;public transport<\/span>","filename":"italian on new york subway","ext":".png","w":1052,"h":520,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":61,"tim":1490834629031,"time":1490834629,"md5":"GYWBFFZSRl0To9cL29ro7g==","fsize":1253283,"resto":118849989,"id":"DmH8swS0","country":"CA","m_img":1,"country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118858402,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)20:43:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118857364\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118857364<\/a><br><br>and it gets worse on peak hours, those poor fellas that travel on public transport<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;finish working day at 6pm<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;tired as fuck<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;everyone is tired<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;metro is full as a tuna can<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;one of these faggots manage to get inside<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;waits until the door closes<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;starts blasting his shitty music at full volume on your face<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;become deaf by the time you get to your station<\/span><br><br>good thing i dont have to use it anymore","filename":"JUST","ext":".jpg","w":924,"h":732,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":99,"tim":1490834638649,"time":1490834638,"md5":"T6TaD1C486WYbtJ7mV7HQA==","fsize":148973,"resto":118849989,"id":"ba2w9G0K","country":"MX","country_name":"Mexico"},{"no":118858564,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)20:45:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118853108\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118853108<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;best city in the world<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;its good cuz (((they))) say so<\/span><br><br>Yeah its the best city in the world....if you prentend Tokyo doesn&#039;t exist.

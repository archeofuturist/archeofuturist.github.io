Women have never needed to be funny for us to want to fuck them. In fact they don&#039;t need to be much of anything besides half-attractive for average-desirability men to want to fuck them. Most men don&#039;t have that luxury of picking out a funny one, when it&#039;s hard enough to find a half-decent looking one who will let you flop around on top of them.

They don&#039;t get bullied like men do at a young age. Society as lower expectations of them. They&#039;re taught their feelings are valid and worth attention. And even if they aren&#039;t constantly validated, they can find recourse somewhere else more easily than a man. If a hot chick is told to shut the fuck up or put down in a social situation, she doesn&#039;t need to focus on personality improvement. She can just look for validation for her looks somewhere else. Hot chicks just leave and set up shop in other peoples&#039; lives constantly. They need very little self reliance up to a certain age. This lack of incentive for self improvement is also the reason a lot of women are terrible story tellers.

It seems to me, that not only am I responsible for learning new content, I am now also responsible for interpreting the content in whatever language it is presented in, into English. Last I checked, I was not in school to become an interpreter. <br>Our teachers and professors are some of the highest paid in to Country, professors make over six figures, and they don&#039;t even need to be proficient in the language of the country they are teaching in. <br>This is what my tax dollars are contributing to. <br>I don&#039;t understand how fluency in English is no longer a requirement to be a teacher\/professor. <br>This is multiculturalism.","filename":"Shit Professors","ext":".png","w":1904,"h":585,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":76,"tim":1493047667554,"time":1493047667,"md5":"FzGeTt43FATUjqd6RrSbow==","fsize":166778,"resto":0,"id":"Z2Ibeuk4","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"why-do-universities-hire-professors-who-dont","country_name":"Canada","replies":2,"images":1,"unique_ips":2},{"no":122597755,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)11:31:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"Nobody else has had this experience at a university?","filename":"Unknown","ext":".jpg","w":275,"h":183,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1493047905836,"time":1493047905,"md5":"VhP1EuW2Cq0DjuPhd9DQaA==","fsize":7857,"resto":122597306,"id":"Z2Ibeuk4","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122599358,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)11:44:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"Windsor?","time":1493048682,"resto":122597306,"id":"ccrlAwnY","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]}

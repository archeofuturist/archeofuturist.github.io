I think it was meant to push Assad closer to Russia. Russia is smart enough to not want a full scale over Assad&#039;s slice of rock. So with Assad completely under his wing, Putin will be able to more freely talk over Assad with regard to action in Syria. Before, Assad did have some wiggle room to do what he pleased, it is his country anyway, but that was at odds with both whatever Russia&#039;s plan in Syria is and Trump&#039;s plan for the Middle East. One bullet point being Syrian safe zones. We couldn&#039;t very well call the shots on that development so long as Assad acted anywhere near freely. This strike, while not causing too much damage helps that. It also didn&#039;t hurt that China&#039;s president was in the U.S talking to Trump while this went on. <br><br>Also, I wonder why Trump met with Jordan&#039;s president just a few days prier and made such a show of it? Perhaps Jordan is willing to take part in the safe zone plan?","time":1491778555,"resto":120349226,"id":"N2PAmKCp","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

My mother was born in Italy, my father in Singapore (both white, thanks). I have no legal entitlement to apply for citizenship in those countries, and nor do my parents. How can any nationalist continue to tolerate America&#039;s suicidal citizenship laws? Answer: they can&#039;t. They wouldn&#039;t, ergo Trump is not a nationalist, something we already knew. Trump is a blank canvas. Steve thought he could paint him like a canvas, but he didn&#039;t take into account the people around Trump. I don&#039;t blame Steve. He had to try something and Trump was our best bet, but he&#039;s lost to the neocohens, if he wasn&#039;t secretly one all along.<br>All of my earned bux against all of your neetbux that the number of immigrants in the US will increase in Trump&#039;s term. Add to that an increase in numbers coming from the arab world. Trump is going to cave on this shortly.<br>Also, wait for next school shooting tragedy and Trump is shown pictures of dead toddlers. Yep, you guessed it. &quot;Those poor, beautiful babies. That crossed a lot of lines for me, and I&#039;ve now changed my mind on guns.&quot;<br>Lastly, Gorsuch is not \/ourguy\/. He isn&#039;t their guy either, but he&#039;ll end up being surprisingly liberal, like one or two others on the bench of the supreme court. Gorsuch was the compromise guy, when Trump had no need to compromise. The bluster from the dems is pure political theatre.

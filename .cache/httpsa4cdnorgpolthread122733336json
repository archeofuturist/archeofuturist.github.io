(I&#039;m not too well versed on Estonian history)<\/span><br>There was general discontentment amongst the Gen X with the way how our country was not going nowhere and our economy was just merely functioning but not nothing in the country was getting better or being modernized. People were hopeless, drank on their jobs, stole from the government and merely just &quot;functioning&quot; but not really enjoying their lives, since communism was a bleak system that demanded people to be drones and slaves for the government, but indepentent thinking, creativity and enterprising was punished, while loyalty was rewarded.<br><br>This produced a nihilistic environment for young people where they were very much impressed by the punk records they sometimes got their hands on from somebody smuggling them from Finland and selling on the black markets. Eventually, many young people started their own punk bands and inspired others. Actually, in Estonia our type of punk in the 80&#039;s was based on british punk, not american. Sex Pistols was immensely popular.<br><br>Over time, after all these fights with the police and protests against censorship of the music, the nihilism grew into search for meaning, and many punks embraced anti-soviet attitudes and nationalism.

The sounds needs touches of what&#039;s modern, maybe some added effects on to the instruments, obviously better recording equipment, a message layered in irony and sarcasm because everyone is in love with that, a marketing campaign on the internet (saves money obviously and makes it easier to get your shit out there for people to see).<br><br>I agree that you need to use real instruments to get your emotions out, it&#039;s never going to be the same with FL studio, but we should no forget the advantages that these things bring. you can record some music with the lads, and then edit the fuck out of them and give each song some characteristic.

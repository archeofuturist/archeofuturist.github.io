People were hopeless, drank on their jobs, stole from the government and merely just &quot;functioning&quot; but not really enjoying their lives, since communism was a bleak system that demanded people to be drones and slaves for the government, but indepentent thinking, creativity and enterprising was punished, while loyalty was rewarded.<br><br>This produced a nihilistic environment for young people where they were very much impressed by the punk records they sometimes got their hands on from somebody smuggling them from Finland and selling on the black markets. Eventually, many young people started their own punk bands and inspired others. Actually, in Estonia our type of punk in the 80&#039;s was based on british punk, not american. Sex Pistols was immensely popular.<br><br>Over time, after all these fights with the police and protests against censorship of the music, the nihilism grew into search for meaning, and many punks embraced anti-soviet attitudes and nationalism.

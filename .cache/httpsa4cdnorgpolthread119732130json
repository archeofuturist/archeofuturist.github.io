Why do you think Black people never ride them, apart from when they are stealing them? It&#039;s because a black man can never become in tune with a bike, as it is the very model of aerodynamics, efficiency and purity. A black man riding a bicycle is like a chicken trying to manoeuvre a blimp. Black people target bikes so much when stealing as they know this and are jealous of the white man&#039;s relationship with bicycles and want to hurt whites by taking them and trading them for skag. Blacks hate bikes because they don&#039;t offer no gibs. A car will do the work for you, a bike requires temperament and concentration, two things Blubberlips Bazonde will never possess. Is there anything more quintessentially white than a bespectacled gentleman gliding down the street on a penny-farthing, his overcoats flapping in the wind as he salutes the gentle women by the side of the village green? With a gentle tip of his moustache, he causes embroidered lady-knickers to fill with clotted cream from so many delicate and noble quims. Have you ever seen a jigaboo ride a penny-farthing?

Ok well calm me down. I need some leftists and neutrals to shoot down my hysteria and conspiracy theory. Because I literally think the Rice story and the Syrian gassing were connected.<br><br>We need leftists and neutrals deeply fortified in their disbelief of this conspiracy so that if something happens they can&#039;t completely disconnect the horrific event from the rice testimony.<br><br>The consistency of our political battle has been for the left to entrench itself on a stance only to have to take a step back and rationalize why they were wrong. We have to get them to do it again.<br><br>The Rice testimony needs to be heard by all. The news shouldn&#039;t be focused on something else. If some fucked up N Korea missile launch or Syrian Gas event happens, they will tune out Rice. If we get them to focus on why the government or globalists aren&#039;t going to distract from her testimony then we get them to acknowledge her testimony, and we also get them to coincide the date of her testimony with an event that could distract them if one occurs.<br><br>It&#039;d also be great if the hysteria got so bad that the news covered Trump supporters hysterical over a conspiracy theory to distract from Rice. It&#039;d be 4D chess to get them to acknowledge the testimony.<br><br>Get something trending:<br>#RiceDDay<br>#RiceTalksGasDrops","filename":"pepe","ext":".jpg","w":717,"h":800,"tn_w":224,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491541396086,"time":1491541396,"md5":"uWGPcRApQrm\/jTzBDa\/uRA==","fsize":73405,"resto":0,"id":"rr5l7reC","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"meme-warfare-operation-fried-rice","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

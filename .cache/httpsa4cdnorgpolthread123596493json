I&#039;m also staunchly anti-Israel, but not to the point I would call myself pro-Assad. My contention is that our alliance with the Middle East and North Africa is archaic and built upon Cold War tensions. With the dissolution of the USSR, I believe we no longer need to bend over backwards to assist Israeli and Saudi interests as the spread of Russian influence has slowed down significantly. I&#039;d much rather have our foreign policy focused on undermining Chinese influence rather than Russian influence for the time being.<br><br>Here&#039;s the way I see it. The deep state throwing a hissy fit about Russia are akin to the liberals in Hollywood going on strike. They no longer want to do their job because they&#039;ll have to invest time into compiling a new plan of action, rather than taking the easy route and staying the course with our already established allies. However, in reality, Russia has lost serious land, including significant portions of their food and energy production, with the collapse of the USSR. For the time being, they shouldn&#039;t be considered the immediate threat to American hegemony. But because Israeli and Saudi interests have infiltrated the deep state, coupled with complacency, changing the objective isn&#039;t something they&#039;re interested in. Although McCain is wrong about Syria, he was always right about North Korea.","time":1493630642,"resto":123596493,"id":"IA0G7gfb","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123600250,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)05:24:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123596654\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123596654<\/a><br>What","filename":"1493570624150","ext":".png","w":211,"h":246,"tn_w":107,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493630652650,"time":1493630652,"md5":"zWYasSMOb086uK1re3BPgA==","fsize":10798,"resto":123596493,"id":"S8YsU9dq","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123600264,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)05:24:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"Should I?","filename":"Breitbort","ext":".png","w":810,"h":431,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":66,"tim":1493630659109,"time":1493630659,"md5":"f7A7MpwSwlgZLUjtW\/\/oMg==","fsize":401922,"resto":123596493,"id":"MIGrTUQQ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123600267,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)05:24:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123600018\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123600018<\/a><br><a href=\"#p123599491\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123599491<\/a><br><a href=\"#p123599790\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123599790<\/a><br><a href=\"#p123600018\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123600018<\/a><br><a href=\"#p123599911\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123599911<\/a><br><br>Pic related is an article about the polls Trump ran for the 2012 election in 2010.

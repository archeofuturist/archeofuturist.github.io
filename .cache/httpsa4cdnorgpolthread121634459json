In History it&#039;s common for an Empire which creates a hegemonic state of power to plateau and then stagnate. The United States is reaching the end of its plateau and will begin to decline and degrade until it ultimately collapses. <br><br>The United States is obviously decadent, their culture is literally just hedonism centered on self pleasure. There is no purpose in American society. The American politicans and government establishment are increasingly becoming an incompetent oligarchy of career bureaucrats simply interested in stealing as much as they can for themselves and their corrupt business interests. The United States military industrial complex is a prime example, instead of sacrificing profits to ensure a strong and stable nation. They bleed the government and taxpayers dry, even at the cost of national defence. Americans don&#039;t believe in their nation, but rather what they can selfishly do for themselves. <br><br>An Empire cannot maintain itself with such a vain apathetic attitude. There is no course now but the decline and fall of the American Empire.","time":1492488353,"resto":121634459,"id":"4qQFZJli","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121635516,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)00:08:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121635223\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121635223<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;beginning<\/span><br>I think we&#039;ve been in decline for quite some time.","time":1492488511,"resto":121634459,"id":"VPClPs4j","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121635627,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)00:09:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121635223\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121635223<\/a><br>HAHAHA.

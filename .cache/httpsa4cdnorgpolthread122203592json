I just realized I&#039;m talking about some dumbass bitch I used to pound back in the day, not Chelsea Clinton, but the second I saw this picture it was like I got jolted back in time. It&#039;s the physical manifestation of a deep, untreatable mental illness.","time":1492824360,"resto":122203592,"id":"AxgUe5UP","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122215335,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)21:26:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"Mad props to whatever photo God made her look that skinny.

Mid table. Problem is Twerton Park, though it&#039;s a good ground for that level, it&#039;s a poisoned chalice cos it&#039;s too big and it&#039;s old and expensive to run for suck a low-level club. It&#039;s a fucking black hole so no luxuries like a scouting or anything like that. One of our managers was literally doing it for free not very long ago. It&#039;s a fucking joke. Haven&#039;t been for a while cos the absolute state of the club is depressing and the football is fucking dire. Club is probably going under in the next few years. I don&#039;t really like talking about it tbqh. No serious rivals really, depends what league we&#039;re in. Chippenham might get promoted so we will probably pick up our &#039;rivalry&#039; with them if they do. Bristol Rovers are sort of a second team for me since they played at Twerton for a bit.","time":1491606379,"resto":120040978,"id":"RJOdSxsi","country":"GB","country_name":"United

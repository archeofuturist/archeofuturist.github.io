These individuals are real outliers, and still they are far from brilliant by white standards. Furthermore, the smartest outliers in a given race are not guaranteed to produce children who are intelligent to the same degree. And in fact, they tend not to. Read up on regression to the mean if you haven&#039;t. <br><br>You admit that culture develops along racial lines, but that admission does little to address the psychological effect that being mixed-race has on the minds of the offspring produced by mixed-race couples. These children are often alienated. Best case scenario, they&#039;ll be coffee-colored enough to pass as black, and those who are almost always end up identifying themselves as such. The ones who just look like a weird hard-to-place mystery meat mix feel alienated because they don&#039;t really fit in anywhere. <br><br>The black phenotype is more dominant than the white. Thus, any white person who racemixes, be they male or female, will produce offspring that do not look like them. The desire for one&#039;s children to look like oneself is deeply rooted in our brains, and those who deny themselves that basic and sensible desire ought not to be applauded for their decision to do so. Cultural morays that celebrate the dilution of one&#039;s hereditary identity are nothing more than collective, societal-wide virtue signaling, and they have the unfortunate long-term effect of damaging any recessive (i.e. white) race&#039;s ability to promulgate itself.","time":1491008233,"resto":119117004,"id":"2i0Vubbh","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119123716,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)20:58:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119117499\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119117499<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;and all memory of it.<\/span><br>enjoy your mud hutt","time":1491008281,"resto":119117004,"id":"5Pd0ML\/s","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119123733,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)20:58:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119123190\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119123190<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;if you really think jews control everything<\/span><br><br>You seem antisemitic.

Religious uses of &quot;Greater Israel&quot; refer to one of the Biblical definitions of the Land of Israel found in Genesis 15:18\u201321, Deuteronomy 11:24, Deuteronomy 1:7, Numbers 34:1\u201315 or Ezekiel 47:13\u201320.<\/span>","filename":"IMG_1728","ext":".jpg","w":400,"h":211,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":65,"tim":1493697296135,"time":1493697296,"md5":"eGx+C3c5tE4M9yIdvc\/1ww==","fsize":40985,"resto":123717464,"id":"ba7SQiD\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

Is the Minister of Healthcare trying to make Nasal sprays more expensive again?\u201d<br><br>\u201cWorse, somebody just stole 7 million euros worth tax money again!\u201d<br><br>The painkillers practically fell out of my bottle. \u201cWhat kind of monster would do something like that? Tax money is the ultimate resource. State owned, taken from the people\u2026 They represent true socialist power, not subject to arbitrary manipulation by any free market. Do we have any leads?\u201d<br><br>\u201cNot yet, but mark my words: we\u2019re going to figure out who did this and we\u2019re going to take them down\u2026 provided some loophole in our flawed legal system won\u2019t screw us over.\u201d<br><br>\u201cEasy, chief.\u201d I said. \u201cAny law the government enforces is, by definition, fair.\u201d<br><br>He laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s why you\u2019re the best I got, Mertensiski. Now you get out there and find that tax money.\u201d<br><br>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019m on it.\u201d<br><br>I put on the state owned siren. Ten minutes later, I was on the scene. It was a normal office building, strangled on all sides by privately owned company buildings. I went inside.<br><br>\u201cMay the soul of Marx have mercy upon thee! Das Polizei!\u201d I said, flashing my badge and my non-lethal pepper spray and a small picture of Lenin. \u201cNobody move, I can only enforce this for 24 hours!\u201d They didn\u2019t.<br><br>\u201cNow, which of you punks stole all our tax money?\u201d No one spoke up.<br><br>\u201cCome on,\u201d I said, \u201cdon\u2019t you all understand that the protection of our tax money is the foundation of our socialist government?\u201d<br><br>It didn\u2019t seem like they did.<br><br>\u201cSeriously, guys, without any legal leads I\u2019m just going to stand here and not solve the crime which will lead to the limitation of this case.\u201d","filename":"17618851_726789770813836_1661892805_n","ext":".jpg","w":298,"h":169,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":141,"tim":1490654081908,"time":1490654081,"md5":"GM4fb3rG0t8NVBMH9q0BCw==","fsize":5872,"resto":0,"id":"jhma9vhD","country":"BE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"a-belgian-utopia","country_name":"Belgium","replies":5,"images":2,"unique_ips":5},{"no":118572572,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)18:35:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"Nothing, these people were stonewalling me. It almost seemed like they didn\u2019t care that a fortune of tax money invented to pay roads was missing.<br><br>I figured I could wait them out. I put on a burka in a public building. A liberal coughed sarcastically, and I told him that it was my right to express my religion. Just then, a man with a moustache made a break for it.<br><br>\u201cTrotsky be with me. Freeze, liberal scumbag!\u201d, I yelled.<br><br>Too late, he was already out the front door. I went after him.<br><br>\u201cStop right there!\u201d, I yelled as I ran. He was faster than me because I tried to use public transport. Our country needs even better public transport, but thanks to the incestuous interplay between our roadway system and the automobile manufacturers, there is always a traffic jam in Brussels.\u201d<br><br>I was losing him. \u201cListen, you\u2019ll get reduction of sentence if you stop now!\u201d<br><br>He turned. In his hand was a stack of money, trying to bribe me but I refused. I pulled out my pepper spray and sprayed at him. I accidentally sprayed on a \u201cLiberal Party Meeting\u201d poster behind him. I sprayed the poser again, on purpose.<br><br>\u201cAll right, all right!\u201d the man yelled, throwing down his fat stack. \u201cI give up, cop! I confess: I took the tax money!\u201d<br><br>\u201cWhy\u2019d you do it?\u201d I asked as I slapped a pair of state regulated cuffs on the guy.<br><br>\u201cBecause I was afraid.\u201d<br><br>\u201cAfraid?\u201d<br><br>\u201cAfraid of an economic future free of a market and BMWs.\u201d, he said, \u201cI\u2019m Siegfried Bracke.\u201d<br><br>I wanted to spray the guy.

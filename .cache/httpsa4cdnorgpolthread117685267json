I got up, showered, and heated a breakfast burrito in the microwave. Thanks to the USDA and FDA, I know my food won&#039;t make me sick when I eat it. I then greeted my son as he got ready for school. Thanks to our public schools, he will receive a quality education that ensures he becomes a productive member of society and also keep him away from crime and drugs. As I got into my car, I reflected on the various safety features that the NHTSA requires motor vehicles to have. The state DOT also erects traffic lights, guard rails, stop signs, and other things to ensure that my driving experience is as safe as possible. Thanks to the local police force, my home is safe from being broken into and robbed while I&#039;m at work.<br><br>When I arrived at work, my supervisor handed me my weekly paycheck. Because of federal minimum wage laws, I am guaranteed a livable pay. When I retire, Social Security will provide me with an income to live on. And because of various other regulations, I am guaranteed a safe workplace environment.<br><br>After coming home in the evening, I went on my computer and browsed www.ronpaul.com where I learned about how the government is stealing from me and taking away my freedoms.","filename":"libertarian paradise","ext":".jpg","w":1008,"h":756,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1490138039832,"time":1490138039,"md5":"ydM8SIIEOoh7wqIalw9eZQ==","fsize":362847,"resto":0,"id":"FA4Bjg04","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"as-i-woke-up-this-morning-i-looked-at-the-time-on","country_name":"United States","replies":5,"images":1,"unique_ips":6},{"no":117685801,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)19:18:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117685267\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117685267<\/a><br>Cool pasta but its really old","time":1490138306,"resto":117685267,"id":"an5Reos0","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":117686032,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)19:20:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117685267\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117685267<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;guaranteed a livable pay<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Social Security will provide me with an income to live on<\/span><br><br><a href=\"#p117685267\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117685267<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;my freedoms<\/span><br><br>Beta leftards not knowing the joys of raping the left via the purely legal conduit that is the Stock Market","time":1490138434,"resto":117685267,"id":"csDMJV42","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117686050,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)19:20:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"it&#039;s true, clocks didn&#039;t exist before there was the Bureau of Weights &amp; Measures","time":1490138446,"resto":117685267,"id":"cJiO6V8u","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117686221,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)19:22:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117686050\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117686050<\/a><br><br>god only knows where we&#039;d be without the bureau of weights and measures.","time":1490138528,"resto":117685267,"id":"bWfwqa00","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117686545,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)19:25:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117685267\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117685267<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I know my food won&#039;t make me sick when I eat it<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Thanks to our public schools, he will receive a quality education<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;ensures he becomes a productive member of society<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;keep him away from crime and drugs<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Thanks to the local police force, my home is safe from being broken into and robbed while I&#039;m at work.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Because of federal minimum wage laws, I am guaranteed a livable pay<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;When I retire, Social Security will provide me with an income to live on<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I am guaranteed a safe workplace environment.<\/span>","filename":"200_s","ext":".gif","w":334,"h":200,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":74,"tim":1490138723581,"time":1490138723,"md5":"fAMv9ZqQxOtqGuNcd2tJ\/g==","fsize":40732,"resto":117685267,"id":"AdmE8z\/u","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"}]}

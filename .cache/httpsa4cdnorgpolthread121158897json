After all, it was not just Thatcherites who told it:left-wing people would scorn or regret the Callaghan years;liberals would condemn the brutality towards Irish republicans under Edward Heath; almost no one had a good word for the Harold Wilson administration of 1974-6. Yet occasionally this version of the seventies would seem too neat. First, there was the question of seventies popular culture. Almost as soon as that decade was over people had started reviving its tastes. By 2000, as far as such things can be measured, the seventies had probably even overtaken the sixties as the British nostalgia market\u2019s favourite. How had the dead-end Britain of the seventies produced such a flowering of pop music, fashion &amp; television? Some of it could be attributed to the stimulus of bad times \u2013 seventies Britain as a kind of Weimar Republic, a spooky parallel often invoked under Wilson and Callaghan \u2013 while some of the recurring appetite for seventies culture could be put down to simple generational nostalgia and love of kitsch.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;But these explanations have a blind spot. If Britain was so sickly in the seventies, where did people get the money at the time to buy so many records and bold pairs of trousers? A poster campaign mounted by the Labour Party in 2005 inadvertently provided an answer. \u2018Lowest Unemployment for 29 Years\u2019, the posters read in fat pink seventies letters. For anyone who also knew about another, more famous political billboard concerning the Labour Party and unemployment-Saatchi and Saatchi\u2019s corrosive \u2018Labour Isn\u2019t Working\u2019 campaign for the Conservatives against the Callaghan government in 1978-the 2005 posters came as an unexpected corrective. Unemployment in the seventies, taken at the time to be a great symptom of political failure, and notorious as such ever since, was actually low by modern standards, even during the long economic boom of the Blair years.<\/span>","time":1492249925,"resto":121158897,"id":"qmz19SUP","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121194230,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)05:52:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121193865\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121193865<\/a><br>Dwindling, is it in our interests that she does win?","time":1492249955,"resto":121158897,"id":"eJ4u2Swg","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121194271,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)05:53:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121193865\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121193865<\/a><br>hope she wins to fuck up the eu<br><br>she&#039;s still a jew and russian S L A G though","time":1492249986,"resto":121158897,"id":"sX2AFxLU","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121194290,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)05:53:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121193022\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121193022<\/a><br>Indonesia bule<br>Hong Kong gwailo<br>Thailand farrang<br>Mexico gringo (not always offensive) <br>Too many to list.

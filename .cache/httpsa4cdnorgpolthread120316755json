I&#039;ll go with argument at first claiming the chemical attack was legitimate. Alright, so yes it&#039;s bad that 59 people were killed in the attack. So, the US responds by sending 50+ missiles in retaliation? Why? What do we gain from this? I could possibly understand if the number were higher, but 59? Why would Trump let Putin know ahead of time? Why was the airstrip vacant? Now I&#039;ll go with the argument that the chemical attack was fake. I used to work at a hazmat company. We would never have used respirators, but instead some type of supplied air. Full class A chemical suits would have been worn. Skin and respiratory exposure would have been zero. Even if the attack and photos are fake, why would they not have the sense to have better photography? Are Trump, Putin, and Syria this retarded? Was this fiasco trying to declare to the world that Russia and the US are not in cahoots? I&#039;m left with more questions than answers. And let&#039;s not forget Trump&#039;s 180 on his stance with Syria. Can any anon shed some light on this?<br>tl;dr Why did we send 50+ cruise missiles, when there were only 59 casualties?","filename":"1491674211768","ext":".jpg","w":779,"h":938,"tn_w":207,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491763257885,"time":1491763257,"md5":"VmNsUTEXE+AcnfzMTM01\/A==","fsize":231778,"resto":0,"id":"ahcZ0+ev","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"i-have-questions-about-syria","country_name":"United States","replies":14,"images":5,"unique_ips":6},{"no":120317301,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)14:44:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"Bump","filename":"1491688299313","ext":".jpg","w":349,"h":940,"tn_w":46,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491763480962,"time":1491763480,"md5":"p2i+7scrVEzM8N9UWXG7iw==","fsize":108369,"resto":120316755,"id":"ahcZ0+ev","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120317707,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)14:47:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120316755\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120316755<\/a><br>it was virtue signalling because of coughing kids.

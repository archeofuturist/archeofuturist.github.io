Here&#039;s are some statistics I&#039;ve found when comparing to my home country:<br><br>Most men in Australia get married at 31.8 years old to a woman aged 29.8 years old (2 year gap). They have a 43% chance of divorce. Australia is at least 61.1% christian, 22.3% atheist, 2.2% muslim and 14.4% other. Australia is 75% white.<br><br>Most men in Poland get married at 29.1 years old to a woman aged 26.7 years old (2.4 year gap). They have a 27% chance of divorce. Polish women also have 55% less sexual partners before marriage on average compared to Australian women. Poland is at least 88.2% christian, 2.4% atheist, and 1% other. Poland is 99% white. You are also 27.27% less likely to be murdered in Poland compared to Australia.<br><br>47% of polish citizens are willing to fight for their country (higher than any western Europe country). Only 29% of Australians are willing to fight for their country.<br><br>It will cost me $2225 USD to get citizenship. Worth it? I&#039;m only 20 years old by the way.","filename":"imgres","ext":".png","w":210,"h":131,"tn_w":210,"tn_h":131,"tim":1493893698225,"time":1493893698,"md5":"SCGnNsrek6cmGq\/MLd+ejg==","fsize":199,"resto":0,"id":"YhWySSef","country":"AU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"poland-citizenship","country_name":"Australia","replies":24,"images":0,"unique_ips":15},{"no":124046980,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)06:31:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124046761\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124046761<\/a><br>Do it you dumb fucker.

Yet this picture shows the horizon RISING to eye level, and if you were to look around in a panorama, from your perspective the earths surface would appear to rise up to the vanishing point where you couldn&#039;t see any further. That&#039;s the exactly opposite of what a sphere would do!<br><br>If you still want it to be round you have to argue that it can somehow be round yet flat at the same time. I don&#039;t care how big of a sphere you have of what kind of cross section you want to take of it. A tangent line is a tangent line. <br><br>Checkmate, ball earthers.","filename":"dubai flat","ext":".jpg","w":5184,"h":3456,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1490326813942,"time":1490326813,"md5":"kIHItouBrk3f6quiTqqMfQ==","fsize":471976,"resto":0,"id":"sUHvayuZ","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"they-are-hiding-the-flat-earth-truth","country_name":"United States","replies":6,"images":2,"unique_ips":5},{"no":118035621,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)23:47:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118034802\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118034802<\/a><br>why would you see the curvature of the earth from only 1km high","time":1490327264,"resto":118034802,"id":"cRuf6D9g","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118035763,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)23:48:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118035621\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118035621<\/a><br>Don&#039;t tell him too quickly, let him process it. <br><br>I&#039;m convinced Flat Earthers are dumber than down syndrome people. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;tfw these people have never been in an airplane in their lives before<\/span>","time":1490327337,"resto":118034802,"id":"JSluzUPZ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118035886,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)23:49:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118034802\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118034802<\/a><br>you&#039;re worse than a canadian","time":1490327397,"resto":118034802,"id":"6v4sTH9B","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118036396,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)23:54:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118035621\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118035621<\/a><br><br>Why wouldn&#039;t you? <br><br>According to geometry and the supposed size of the earth, the curvature is supposed to be 8 inches per mile squared.

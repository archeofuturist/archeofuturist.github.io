The sun sets very quickly if you sit on the beach and watch it. Looks like the sun sinks into the ocean in about 30 mins flat. This is what ancient Polynesians thought happened, the ocean swallowed the sun. However in an airplane you are going toward the sunset so it lasts several<br>hours. In a boat the same thing happens. You chase the sunset. I have seen it with my own eyes have been in North &amp; South pole areas no wall. Plus I hate to burst your bubble my Dad worked for NASA in the 1960s-1980s. They really went to the moon. I have some special<br>photos and other information that I know 100% they went to the moon. I know many astronauts throughout my life. I think you people have spent too much time watching movies and not exploring the world. Do like we did back in the day ... one year in advance book a packaged trip to bali through a travel agent.

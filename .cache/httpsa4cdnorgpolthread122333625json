Every professor is a Jew, every gallery owner is a Jew, etc etc. This was actually what finally redpilled me and turned me to \/pol\/. They run it all and that&#039;s why only bad art is sold for large sums. They purposely promote shitty art because they&#039;re trying to destroy our culture (they also use this process to launder money). You typically don&#039;t get your work into a good gallery unless you&#039;re a jew yourself or deep in with Masons\/Luciferianism or at the very least perform sexual favors for these elite Jews. There are actually some very good traditional and highly skilled artists out there. They either end up going into the film\/video game industries because they&#039;re blocked out of the fine art market by kikes, or they end up like me, penniless and stuck in a MCjob until I can pay off my 110k student loan debt (as if that&#039;s even possible). Everyone told me with such an elite degree I should have no trouble getting into academia and I could have it paid off in a few years with my big salary. Turns out academia works the same way the galleries do.

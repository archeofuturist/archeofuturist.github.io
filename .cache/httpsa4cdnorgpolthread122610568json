What you\u2019re referring to as slavs, are in fact, ruthenians\/eastern germanic descendants of kievan rus, or as I\u2019ve recently taken to calling it, east nordids.<br><br>Slavs are not a race unto itself, but rather another component of the ethnogenesis of the scandinavian norse germanic people from the migration of the peoples and onward, made historically relevant by the kievan rus settlements in Gardariki by the norsemen who traveled down the Volga and founded both Russia and Ukraine before being christianized by the byzantine empire.<br><br>Many eastern germanics speak the artifical glagolithic church language invented by the greek monk Cyrill, which is where the term cyrillics stems from. Before that, they spoke old norse and revered pagan germanic gods.<br><br>All the so-called &quot;slavs&quot; are really descendants of eastern germanics. There is objectively no argument to be made against this historical fact.<br><br>Thanks for reading, and please refer to them as &quot;eastern germanics&quot; next time you make a &quot;slav&quot; thread.","filename":"1490581156-740","ext":".png","w":500,"h":500,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493054855449,"time":1493054855,"md5":"0ty9cze4knFmoZbF2SdfZA==","fsize":104427,"resto":122610568,"id":"0MoPONpC","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":122611072,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)13:27:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122610568\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122610568<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;and if no, why no?<\/span><br>Russia.","time":1493054856,"resto":122610568,"id":"TxWs0Avu","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":122611126,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)13:27:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122611051\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122611051<\/a><br>Fuck off nigger","filename":"1476635664433","ext":".jpg","w":2560,"h":1912,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1493054878046,"time":1493054878,"md5":"thN4CiIFfvwewVMDwVw1Sw==","fsize":817797,"resto":122610568,"id":"ILvmR3U9","country":"PL","m_img":1,"country_name":"Poland"},{"no":122611132,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)13:28:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122611019\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122611019<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;i like all of us<\/span><br><br>It&#039;s cause we&#039;re good people, senpai","time":1493054880,"resto":122610568,"id":"BCkg8H0p","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122611135,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)13:28:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122610568\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122610568<\/a><br>As for the politics, there were in the past.

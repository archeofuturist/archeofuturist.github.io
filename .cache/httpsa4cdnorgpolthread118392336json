I don&#039;t care what reservations you have about her, her party, her ideology, what matters is that the alternative is ten times worse for France, for Europe. All of us are counting on you to make a dent in the system and you&#039;re the only ones who can. <br><br>Germany, Sweden, the Netherlands all have parliamentary coalition governments which allows them to keep change out the door. Your system allows for real change. And you can achieve it. <br><br>Go out, talk about FN, don&#039;t be shy! Admit your support!

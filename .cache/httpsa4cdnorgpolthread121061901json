Also North Korea has more complaints in this respect than China does. The ocean territorial dispute has been on going between all four countries for the last 50 years. They are still heavy trade partners. The only country they are all firmly against and all have trade sanctions against is North Korea. That should tell you something. It isn&#039;t North Korea refusing to do trade with them it is them refusing trade with North Korea even though they all trade with one another. China and South Korea all have issues with Japan for the Imperial occupation still but they are still working past that.

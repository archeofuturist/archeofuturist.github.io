Today lets talk about the ultimate far right candidate to the presidency : Jair Messias Bolsonaro.<br><br>So, here is his profile :<br><br>Congressman, Ex military, married to a half nigger brazilian wife(but who isnt a half nigger in brazil), have 3 sons, one of them is a police officer\/congressman. <br>Ideological analysis : Conservative\/traditionalist\/nationa<wbr>list. He dialogs to both the very traditionalist and the new born libertarian sect in brazil, witch he cant please since he does not have a proper economic plan.<br><br>His policies will be : <br>-death penalty to dindus. <br>-forced labor to minor crimes.<br>-increase security.<br>-chemical castration to rapists.<br>-abolish the marriage between same sexes. <br>-put as much military into his ministeries.<br>-Nationalize the public companies (by that i mean sell it to the private sector but it must be a brazilian company). He will not nationalize everything, he already told some sources petrobras is out of question.<br><br><br>Major flaw : he is alligned to jews. I dont really know exacly how, but seems he went to Israel and talked to some people, probably asking for money or some shit in jewish banks.","filename":"1474932266636","ext":".png","w":673,"h":870,"tn_w":193,"tn_h":249,"tim":1490221766063,"time":1490221766,"md5":"CEevnTiqHsRNxuMJ30h0Mg==","fsize":108338,"resto":0,"id":"C62eJE2t","country":"BR","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"lmbgfo","country_name":"Brazil","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

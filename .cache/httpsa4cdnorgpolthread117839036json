Today lets talk about the ultimate far right candidate to the presidency : Jair Messias Bolsonaro.<br><br>So, here is his profile :<br><br>Congressman, Ex military, married to a half nigger brazilian wife(but who isnt a half nigger in brazil), have 3 sons, one of them is a police officer\/congressman. <br>Ideological analysis : Conservative\/traditionalist\/nationa<wbr>list. He dialogs to both the very traditionalist and the new born libertarian sect in brazil, witch he cant please since he does not have a proper economic plan.<br><br>His policies will be : <br>-death penalty to dindus. <br>-forced labor to minor crimes.<br>-increase security.<br>-chemical castration to rapists.<br>-abolish the marriage between same sexes. <br>-put as much military into his ministeries.<br>-Nationalize the public companies (by that i mean sell it to the private sector but it must be a brazilian company). He will not nationalize everything, he already told some sources petrobras is out of question.<br><br><br>Major flaw : he is alligned to jews. I dont really know exacly how, but seems he went to Israel and talked to some people, probably asking for money or some shit in jewish banks.","filename":"1474932266636","ext":".png","w":673,"h":870,"tn_w":193,"tn_h":249,"tim":1490221766063,"time":1490221766,"md5":"CEevnTiqHsRNxuMJ30h0Mg==","fsize":108338,"resto":0,"id":"C62eJE2t","country":"BR","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"lmbgfo","country_name":"Brazil","replies":28,"images":9,"unique_ips":10},{"no":117839347,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)18:31:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117839036\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117839036<\/a><br>proof that he is pro israel :","filename":"13177134_517655968427032_1710707185281739677_n-810x810","ext":".jpg","w":810,"h":810,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490221875909,"time":1490221875,"md5":"oXzYRvdYvoeIBrxmEiTm8Q==","fsize":170006,"resto":117839036,"id":"C62eJE2t","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":117839495,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)18:32:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117839036\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117839036<\/a><br>here is a pic of all brazilian candidates, except for bolsonaro all of them are gommies.","filename":"blog-1777","ext":".jpg","w":720,"h":480,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1490221935424,"time":1490221935,"md5":"A46VQRciJWoja9\/vQrUp3w==","fsize":117238,"resto":117839036,"id":"C62eJE2t","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":117840762,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)18:41:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117839036\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117839036<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;putting a 20 years dindunfin hothead congressman into presidency<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;fixing Brazil<\/span><br>pick one","filename":"17098684_1787387141580792_4674613457606301139_n","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":456,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":114,"tim":1490222468105,"time":1490222468,"md5":"fbotxH2vVFzAlsb3pqk6\/g==","fsize":41788,"resto":117839036,"id":"OhSSCarG","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":117841096,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)18:43:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117840762\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117840762<\/a><br>can you show better options ?","time":1490222595,"resto":117839036,"id":"C62eJE2t","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":117841406,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)18:45:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117841096\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117841096<\/a><br>no and I don&#039;t have to","time":1490222719,"resto":117839036,"id":"OhSSCarG","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":117841558,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)18:46:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117841406\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117841406<\/a><br>nice, mabe you are in the wrong board. i was expecting some political talk in here.","time":1490222778,"resto":117839036,"id":"C62eJE2t","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":117842424,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)18:52:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117839036\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117839036<\/a><br>Option 1: Bolsonaro.","filename":"84JMdcT","ext":".jpg","w":960,"h":514,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":66,"tim":1490223129540,"time":1490223129,"md5":"Ofr5xu\/\/PjmsxarIje1lmw==","fsize":231780,"resto":117839036,"id":"30gAJxo3","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":117842444,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)18:52:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117839036\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117839036<\/a><br>bump for the great justice !","filename":"4255cdb86edc0","ext":".jpg","w":2718,"h":1311,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":60,"tim":1490223135919,"time":1490223135,"md5":"VgsW1d1275uXXvv3nK9kNQ==","fsize":345594,"resto":117839036,"id":"C62eJE2t","country":"BR","m_img":1,"country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":117842465,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)18:52:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117839036\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117839036<\/a><br>Option 2: WE WUZ","filename":"Bragan\u00e7a-Orleans","ext":".png","w":200,"h":266,"tn_w":93,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490223148318,"time":1490223148,"md5":"VtyYEmHjIad\/asOIVZeEVg==","fsize":60998,"resto":117839036,"id":"30gAJxo3","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":117842547,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)18:53:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117839036\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117839036<\/a><br>Option 3: Let Lula win and send a fuck you to the rest of Brazil","filename":"bandeira-identitc3a1ria-paulista","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":386,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":75,"tim":1490223183813,"time":1490223183,"md5":"+mFvypswV1im\/vtqdJIeFg==","fsize":68621,"resto":117839036,"id":"30gAJxo3","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":117842670,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)18:53:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;death penalty to dindus\u00f1<\/span><br>I&#039;m in.

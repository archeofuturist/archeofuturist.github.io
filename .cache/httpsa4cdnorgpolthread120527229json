Atheists don&#039;t stfu, they go on and on. I don&#039;t believe but I still follow religion because I think it is best for the world. But seriously I get preached at by atheists non stop. Even my Jehovah&#039;s witness friend (don&#039;t know if you find it elsewhere but basically morman tier) is nice and knows the boundaries, athiests are literally destroying society because they read Dawkins and want to be edgy (note I don&#039;t mind Dawkins, just his autistic fan boys)","filename":"Dawko","ext":".jpg","w":780,"h":520,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1491873836547,"time":1491873836,"md5":"foTrxme+OBD\/icaCnv\/cKQ==","fsize":55332,"resto":0,"id":"xgPZKraS","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"edgy-atheism","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

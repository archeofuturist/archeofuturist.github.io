This attack killed Assad troops and civilians. <br><br>The Gouta attack later that same year was blamed on Assad, and the UN investigators said &quot;that the chemical agents used in the Khan al-Assal chemical attack &quot;bore the same unique hallmarks as those used in Al-Ghouta.&quot;<br><br>The rebels have done two chemical attacks. These chemical attacks are false flags. Western interesest funnel the weapons or imbed specialists with the rebels to carry out the attacks. Western MSM blames Assad.

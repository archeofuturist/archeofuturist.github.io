Notice the tail of this mermaid is shaped like a stylized crescent? See the evolution of starbucks logo - it used to be different - there were 3 or 4 of them. Notice the emblem didn&#039;t have star on top of the crown - they added it when they started global WAR-ming. So this starbucks corporation is military incursion by those who sell arabica.

Like new money or people who buy it because it&#039;s overpriced. Poor people can&#039;t afford it and rich people have coffee makers that grind the beans for them. Hipsters go to different coffee shops and I&#039;m pretty sure the only reason Starbucks exists is because of all the surgery coffee based drinks that they sell.

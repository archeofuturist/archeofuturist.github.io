Instead of the afterlife when we die they just wake up in the basereality. Instead of demons and aliens from other realms beyond ours, they have aliens from from far away planets beyond ours. <br>They replace divine concepts and rewrite them so they can be explained with the material.

The alien covenant that chased these hooligans found where they were hiding and set up a quarantine surrounding earth that blocks their dna from trespassing beyond the moon&#039;s orbit. After thousands of years populating the planet, breeding with the inhabitants, and creating genetically altered slave races to do their bidding, the extraterrestrials continued to work diligently to find a way to escape. Soon their slaves revolted and set up kingdoms on different continents. The main kingdom was located in the southeast near india and china, but the homeland of the original ancestors existed where the british isles lay. Because of disputes and further rebellions these two kingdoms resulted in a war. This great war disrupted the earth&#039;s natural bio-grid causing immediate upheavals on the planet. Destroying flora and fauna, and almost eliminating the population of the earth. The trauma caused by this catastrophe split man&#039;s psyche itself making us more resentful towards nature and existentially vacant. Damage was felt on both sides but the atlanteans were impacted less and won the war. However, because of this fallout they lost all their technology and needed to rebuild. Now they would work behind the scenes of government, setting up secret societies\/cabals to rule the planet conspiratorially, not openly like their forebears once did. They had a new goal now. They would dub it &quot;New Atlantis&quot; or (New World Order) one world government where their slaves would be psychologically manipulated, imprisoned but without the need of physical constraint. (VR technology, separating men and women, demasculinizing men, IRD chip implants, creating a one world race so they can be asier controlled, etc) So they could build up their resources and eventually escape this planet once and for all.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;found this on a thread<\/span>","time":1492692789,"resto":121986668,"id":"ibmCJ782","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121991732,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)08:54:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121990698\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121990698<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Dude that&#039;s fucked up, what kind of sick cult would make human sacrifices to this thing?<\/span><br>probably the same sick cult that would make human sacrifices at all","time":1492692841,"resto":121986668,"id":"dXb74l5J","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":121991887,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)08:56:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"Any time someone lies to another person they are saying a Demonic Ritual Prayer therefore practicing a form of Satanic worship.

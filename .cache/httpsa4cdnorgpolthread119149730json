So, the plan is simple. We convince a few news articles (Wired, DailyNews,The Washington Post, etc.) to make news articles based off of WSJ&#039;s newswriters&#039; &quot;anti semetic&#039; posts on twitter, and how WSJ didn`t punish the newswriters. Convince the small stupid writers to write them, since they&#039;ll do it for some attention (theyre desperate). Step 2. when they do, start getting WSJ to respond to said charges. Eventually WSJ will attack those news stations. Then the war shall begin, and all we have to do is watch the fireworks.","filename":"WSJ War Plan","ext":".png","w":2706,"h":1446,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":133,"tim":1491024833422,"time":1491024833,"md5":"7PPvuV17HbDPPMXAy76dmQ==","fsize":1825133,"resto":0,"id":"nxatkj+k","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"operation-news-war","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":119150250,"now":"04\/01\/17(Sat)01:39:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119149730\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119149730<\/a><br>If we keep saying WSJ is anti-semitic and racist, it must be true and their editors MUST be fired","time":1491025189,"resto":119149730,"id":"FIu2Elbb","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119150383,"now":"04\/01\/17(Sat)01:41:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119150250\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119150250<\/a><br>we don`t need to say it, other news artickles need to say it, to attack WSJ.","time":1491025293,"resto":119149730,"id":"nxatkj+k","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

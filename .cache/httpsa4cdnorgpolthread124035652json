I like to think of that in a left versus right mindset<br><br>During the election it was clear to me that if Clinton won, we would have civil war. If Clinton had won, it would have shown the right that the system in place no longer serviced them. The right would have been shown that collectively their voices and what they saw as the voices of the American people still loyal to the idea of liberty were silenced. It became clear just how corrupt the current system was and the election was our only chance to both symbolically and in some ways literally remove corruption from the state. (This came at the cost of the integrity of the system)<br><br>With Trump&#039;s victory it seems to me that the right is appeased for the time being. That means that if civil war is to break out in the next 8 years, it&#039;s gonna be by the left.<br><br>Right now, it seems to me like the political pendulum is shifting right. My peers in the middle are thinking more for themselves and thinking much less of left wing ideaology. The left had its chance and it didn&#039;t solve anything. I&#039;m seeing a rise in right wing ideaology is pop culture in odd places like YouTube channels and even cartoons like the new Samurai jack.<br><br>That said, the left seems to be completely mentally rigid. It seems many of them are doubling down on their beliefs and are highly radicalized already due to mainstream media\/academic establishment pushing and protecting the left.<br><br>So here&#039;s what&#039;s gonna happen. Under Trump we will see a blustering of the right wing. In the fluid world of culture, society is gonna keep shifting more to the right, individualism and heroism will become more prevalent among young adults and mainstream counter culture movements. The alt right will be legitimized as such.","filename":"1486868108490","ext":".jpg","w":275,"h":253,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":230,"tim":1493883745857,"time":1493883745,"md5":"DKjYI\/zgqXnYrT\/XTQT+uA==","fsize":19772,"resto":0,"id":"YMs+xZTt","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"my-thoughts-on-civil-war","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":1,"unique_ips":1},{"no":124035711,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)03:43:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124035652\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124035652<\/a><br>(Cont)<br><br>In the more rigid world of institions, mainstream media and academia will continue to perpetuate leftwing ideals, due to the fact that these institions have many many moving parts and rely heavily of cultural momentum. They will be slow to be affected by the rise in the right. This is bad.<br><br>You see, the recent election was a huge shock to the system. Prior to it, we had a terrible reversal of the right\/left dichotomy. The right is supposed to be the establishment. They are supposed to be the hands off, systematic, law and order creators who maintain a shared belief system. They are the defenders of the status quo, to maintain the integrity of the system. The left is supposed to be the innovators, destroyers, and creators of new content. They tweak and change the system to better fit the ever changing world.<br><br>What wound up happening is Society slowly slid into a terrible place where the left became the mainstream. Where role of preservation of the system was given to the ones who want to change it. So we have a group who is supposed to be an outsideto the system with minimal power to affect it in place of the system. (It would be like if you replace emotional thought with logical thought in your daily life; see how that turns out). This completely fucked up the natural order of society in ways we haven&#039;t even begun to experience.<br><br>What we saw was the alt-right from as a cultural vanguard against this system. We successfully were able to get ourselves back on track, but it happened so quickly (which it needed to) that the left wing momentum in institions will take a long time to catch up. This is bad.<br><br>Those that drank the koolaid on be left will double down on their beliefs. They will not need to change their mindset, because their mainstream support is still in place. This is happening as the right wing start soon becoming more and more prominent in culture. This means that the left will become increasingly radical.","time":1493883797,"resto":124035652,"id":"YMs+xZTt","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124035759,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)03:44:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124035711\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124035711<\/a><br>Basically what will happen is that the left will be put more and more into a corner.<br><br>When this happens, when social isolation begins to take place, most people question their beliefs to an extent and change. But cause mainstream media and academia will support their cause (as they are slow moving institutions) we will see that the left will not question their beliefs as they still believe themselves to be supported by society as a whole (which is no longer true).<br><br>This means that the left will care not for the integrity of the system, as they begin to realize they&#039;re in danger of losing their power over society. The left will begin violently striking out at the right who has begun to dominate the pendulum again.<br><br>We basically are at threat of civil war until mainstream media and academia adapts to the cultural change. As we have seen, many news stations, media outlets, and universities have doubled down against trump. If he doesn&#039;t do anything to persuade them to go in the right direction (ie center left), then we will have serious trouble on our hands.","filename":"1493388425995","ext":".png","w":900,"h":900,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493883844866,"time":1493883844,"md5":"8IG9lU0770DpIsPnMmkM0Q==","fsize":592057,"resto":124035652,"id":"YMs+xZTt","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

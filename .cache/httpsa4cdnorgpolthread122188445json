The left here are insufferable cunts who now openly display their dislike of America. When Hillary called half the country deplorable it didn&#039;t seem like much at the time but it hurt her badly. They also have the media and hollywood on their side so it is just always in your face. <br><br>On top of that they have no coherent message, at least not one they are willing to express in public.

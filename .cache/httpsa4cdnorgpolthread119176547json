It is not a secret from them.<br><br>That said, &#039;we investigated people in the trump campaign&#039; does not mean &#039;we investigated trump&#039;.<br><br>We know Farage has ties to Russia, is a foreign national, and is working to further Russian interests.<br><br>We know Stone has confessed to coordinating strategy with the DNC hackers.<br><br>We know that the DNC hack data was publicized in a manner tailored to benefit the Trump campaign, and that the data release was actually HELD BACK until it could no longer help Bernie in the primary - which rules out the claims that the hacker was simply doing it to hurt Hillary or root out corruption in the DNC.<br><br>We know that Manaforte has been an agent for fucktons of foreign powers in sensitive locations who are legitimate surveillance targets. IIRC we even know that Manaforte is the subject of active investigations into Yanukovich-related corruption.<br><br>These alone are likely to be enough to justify surveillance of three distinct and significant figures in the Trump campaign.","time":1491123067,"resto":119176547,"id":"GmBBpIvw","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119181462,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)04:52:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119181217\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119181217<\/a><br>Go lose a war.","time":1491123126,"resto":119176547,"id":"ywfNGkyg","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":119181501,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)04:52:53","name":"wackaflacka","com":"<a href=\"#p119181188\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119181188<\/a><br>I can say that shit is very wack and that it might even become more wack, however my sources are unclear of how wack the wack shit will get.","time":1491123173,"resto":119176547,"id":"NyXKGajo","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":119181529,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)04:53:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"Team Obama is fucked","filename":"1491061015127s","ext":".jpg","w":125,"h":125,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491123216123,"time":1491123216,"md5":"sLOrv9I5C8mlM75AjMKD6w==","fsize":2955,"resto":119176547,"id":"p+\/GcDPf","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":119181625,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)04:55:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119181411\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119181411<\/a><br><br>Don&#039;t you know, we&#039;re shilling on reddit now","filename":"1490802702431","ext":".png","w":980,"h":742,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":94,"tim":1491123322492,"time":1491123322,"md5":"+qPyeNmqseVQtLkSTH7gbg==","fsize":272769,"resto":119176547,"id":"pGxFzSj5","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":119181673,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)04:56:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119180580\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119180580<\/a><br>The quote is in the post I replied to.<br>The act of unmasking itself is illegal without warrants and depending on who it&#039;s disseminated to it could be legal but she very broadly says &quot;the hill.&quot; Keep in mind that at the time she is referencing she had been out of the government for a year and was working on the Hillary campaign","time":1491123387,"resto":119176547,"id":"D6z\/LVXi","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119181857,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)05:00:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119181179\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119181179<\/a><br>No. She was on the Hillary campaign.

Campaigned for it for years and when he reached part of it he was suddenly gone. Typical for one issue candidate. Once they actually achieve what they want they have no fucking clue how to go on about it. <br><br>He promised a better future without the EU. Maybe that can happen. It won&#039;t happen by itself though. Important decisions have to be made, goals set for the future, treaties negotiated. All this will determine whether the Brexit becomes a success or a disaster for Britain. Now that all this is taking place the fucker, who was most vocal about leaving the EU, is nowhere to be found. <br><br>Why? Because the dip has no idea how to go on from here and doesn&#039;t want to be blamed when it all hits the wall.

The US when it comes to it will just accept it and transition into a South American-like country only with more white enclaves everywhere in suburbs and rural regions with multi-ethnic cities full of mestizos. US whites don&#039;t have the foundation that it&#039;s their homeland and will just keep on reforming, moving and adjusting to live within the framework of the time. Eventually it&#039;ll splinter and Balkanise (perhaps into actual ethnostates) but only when the economy finally gives up the ghost and both economically and militarily the US is surpassed by the rising Asian superpowers.<br><br>Europe won&#039;t go that way though because there&#039;s at least two scenarios an ethnic conflict starts in and both rest strongly on regional identity as a homeland. The EU forces mass migration and multiculturalism into hostile Eastern Europe and the population violently resist or start a cycle of ethnic violence and\/or cleansing migrant communities. Or the native populations in the Western Europe respond to becoming either a minority or losing the numbers to change the political system via elections with anti-government\/anti-minority terrorism and insurgency that could quickly escalate into a full-blown civil war. It&#039;s do-or-die to ethnic European populations with nowhere else to go and no choice but fight or die. I think given a few years we might see the beginning of this stage in either France or Sweden. The risk-taking part of me hopes Macron wins in France to make the young nationalist generation emerging see the binary option or fight or die facing them once the political option is taken away as a possibility.

But Evola is trly great, and accessible. Frogs that don&#039;t read him aren&#039;t true frogs. He died childless because he liked to take strolls during air raids for the meditative qualities of that sort of thing. Many people fail to mention his artistic journey through Dadaism that brought him to many of his traditionalist conclusions. Evola is probably going to be one of the most influential philosophers of the 21st century.","time":1493033584,"resto":122574189,"id":"86Aqc21J","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122576140,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)07:35:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122575953\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122575953<\/a><br>Except he went on to talk about sex magic and the occult and shit, lost the plot imo.

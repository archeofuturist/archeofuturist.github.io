I bought another pair of boots for $100+ dollars and I&#039;ve had them for like 5 years. <br><br>Now think of how much money I would have spent buying a new pair $40 of Walmart boots every 3 months compared to just spending $100+ upfront and having them last for years. <br><br>Free traders are literally retarded","time":1491006122,"resto":119118186,"id":"yG\/cNyL8","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119120442,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)20:25:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119119249\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119119249<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;thinking government loans are what helps small businesses succeed and not investors looking for sellable products\/ideas<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;in 2017<\/span><br><br>Enough.

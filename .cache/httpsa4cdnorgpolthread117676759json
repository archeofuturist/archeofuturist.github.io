I believe BLM is an extension of African American victim culture. Here in Canada, new black immigrants are coming from places where their families worked to gain status, then migrated for better opportunities. They&#039;ll probably wind up influenced by it at some point like everyone else, but they&#039;re alienated by the dindu nuffin, society keeping us down rhetoric. Because they know it isn&#039;t true. They come from places where its ALL blacks, and people keep themselves down through their own practices","time":1490134112,"resto":117676759,"id":"q+ffHXHo","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":117677983,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)18:09:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117676759\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117676759<\/a><br>I know a guy from Nigeria who thinks it&#039;s stupid.

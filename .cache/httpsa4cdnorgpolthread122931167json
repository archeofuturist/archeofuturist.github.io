Do you really want to lower yourself to the level of most people? You know most people are like, borderline retarded these days right?<br><br>You can fake it if you can pull it off, but if you&#039;re not willing to sell out your convictions, pat them on the back for non-achievements, and just generally be a fake piece of shit, you won&#039;t get that far in the social world, because those are the rules for it... and we, as aspies, prefer things to make actual logical sense, so<br><br>I dunno. Maybe I&#039;m not the right person to be giving advice, but I&#039;ll tell you how I made it work for me in the young part of my life... pre 30s.<br><br>Basically I just smoked tons and tons of weed with people until they grudgingly accepted me and were willing to sit around with me, barely talking to each other, just playing video games.<br><br>The downside to this is the only people you can get to be your &quot;friends&quot; in this situation are people who have no jobs and no lives of their own... but that&#039;s also the only way to find a person who can focus and commit the same amount of time to the things that you enjoy, that you do.<br><br>Still didn&#039;t work out great for me though. Just ended up being &quot;friends&quot; with a few idiots. One of them thought that all stars in the sky were nokia cell phone satellites at the age of 20. Yeah, that&#039;s right. He didn&#039;t know that stars were suns that are just far away. I&#039;m dead fucking serious.<br><br>The other one stole some of my most precious video games... including a copy of Earthbound that I actually bought in 1995 for $25 (with the guide! Shit would be worth A FUCKING MINT BY THIS POINT).<br><br>So yeah, on second thought, don&#039;t do what I did.","time":1493239229,"resto":122931167,"id":"B0TLmk27","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

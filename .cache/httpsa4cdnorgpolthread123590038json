Pic related is Piet\u00e0 by Michaelangelo which I believe is the objectively best artwork ever created (of what I&#039;ve seen, which is a lot as an art major) and I believe it can&#039;t even be rated on the same scale as shitty modern art. Like I would say 95% of all &quot;abstract&quot; art is utter bullshit, 5% actually had thought go into it.<br><br>As for cultures or belief systems, id say that the better off the average person is in terms of lifespan and disposable wealth is a good way to measure. As well as rights under the state, like religion and free speech and such. Which is why I believe the USA to be the objectively best country in the world - yeah there&#039;s a looooot of shit wrong here that other countries don&#039;t have. But our average lifespan is pretty high, most of even the poorest among us can afford a cell phone or tv, and we have a great deal of freedoms under the state.","filename":"Michelangelo&#039;s_Pieta_5450_cropncleaned_edit","ext":".jpg","w":1584,"h":1660,"tn_w":119,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493623362700,"time":1493623362,"md5":"feFA6AXUqnGRdrqnvDFcTg==","fsize":642603,"resto":123590038,"id":"GeTNSLwe","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":123592930,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)03:32:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123590038\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123590038<\/a><br>Going off of what <a href=\"#p123590202\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123590202<\/a> said, biology offers set ratios.

The most widely accepted theroic in academia nowadays is Gerard Genette. <br>Genette states that ANY aesthtetic appreciation is intrinsecly subjective, because it cannot get rid of aestethic predicates whitout ceasing itself. <br>that means that when you dig a piece of art you will try to justify your appreciation with aestethic predicates such as &quot;beauty&quot;, &quot;smart&quot;, &quot;well manufactured&quot;, &quot;interesting&quot; etc. (the list is pretty much endless but the point being that any of these predicates will always be subjective to you. <br>In matter of &quot;what is art&quot; the answer is &quot;art is everything that is being presented with an arty appreciation intent&quot;. That means that the Duchamp toilet become a piece of art instead of a bathroom device in the moment Duchamp put it into a museum (or present it with the intent of being evaluated as art).<br><br>Hope this help.","time":1493624403,"resto":123590038,"id":"IzB6ZS+6","country":"IT","country_name":"Italy"},{"no":123593748,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)03:44:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123590202\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123590202<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;two inch heels<\/span>","filename":"1459016537421","ext":".jpg","w":250,"h":222,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":111,"tim":1493624654156,"time":1493624654,"md5":"frcyvL8UyNZbpouRTzhWNQ==","fsize":10667,"resto":123590038,"id":"rQCnqwry","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123594468,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)03:54:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123590038\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123590038<\/a><br>The problem with you people, is you don&#039;t understand what culture is. You think it&#039;s a kind of music, a traditional headdress. You think it&#039;s fucking dances or tacos or goddamn architecture. But you&#039;re fucking wrong. All that shit is just the window dressing, the real culture is the underlying assumptions shared by a group of people. The assumptions that define their behaviors. <br><br>Western culture is defined by individualism and by a rejection of fate. Westerner societies taught their children that they alone are responsible for their own success or failure, that they aren&#039;t defined by their parentage or social caste, but by their own success or failure. Is that always true? Hell no, it&#039;s an ideology. Ideologies never really match up to reality. However, that philosophy, that culture, created societies by which all others are measured and found wanting. <br><br>What is the alternative? What culture has the east? What culture has Africa? They have the culture of &quot;manana&quot;, of &quot;insh&#039;allah. Abby nay, kul and hazar&#039; ho. If it works it works and if it doesn&#039;t it&#039;s not my fault and not my job to fix it. <br><br>You ask me how to measure a piece of art? How to measure a culture? Easy, you measure both by what they give to people. If a piece of art gives people vision and beauty and uplift, then it is worth something. If a culture gives it&#039;s people wealth and health and agency, then it is a good culture. How do you measure the worth of a culture? Personally, I measure it in infant mortality rates. I measure it in wars won, in colonies planted and in the spawning of great men.","time":1493625284,"resto":123590038,"id":"gxFHi17X","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

Pepe varieties outpaced Dat Boi, totaling 58 percent of the harvest. Kekistani Pepe was the top variety. &quot;The weather in eastern Washington cooled down a bit to extend the growing season and allow the memes some extra time to mature on the bush.&quot; said Steve Warner, meme commission president.<br><br>The state has more than 900 memeries, with most of the memes grown east of the Kekade Range that runs through the middle of the state.<br><br>&quot;Our Farmers and mememakers are extremely excited about these memes,&quot; Warner said.<br><br>Production of Pepe varieties showed a substantial increase over the previous year, at 39 percent, while Dat Boi varieties grew by 3 percent. The largest share of the growth in Pepes was Kekistani Pepe, the commission said.<br><br>Plus, new meme field plantings are beginning to produce buds, a trend that&#039;s expected to continue, he said.<br><br>Dank was the second-most popular Meme produced in Washington. &#039;My Neme Jeff&#039; was the top non-Kek and third overall, while bottom-text was fourth.<br><br>Meme farmers received an average of 1,157 shekels per ton for all varieties in 2016, an increase of 12 shekels over the previous year. MAGA Pepe was the most expensive meme, the commission said.<br><br>The preliminary report for California found that average prices for all varieties were 750 shekels per ton, up 11.7 percent from 2015.

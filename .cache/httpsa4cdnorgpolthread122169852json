I felt mentally isolated from people and I thought no one saw the world the way I did. As all young teens do I thought I was a special snowflake.<br><br> I was indoctrinated in to leftist thinking very quickly mostly due to my atheistic beliefs or lack thereof. I thought that religion was the source of the world&#039;s problems and that liberty, democracy, individualism, and working for the common good of all mankind were goals to aspire to.<br><br> My naivety become apparent to myself as I grew older and I was exposed to identity politics. I had believed in a dream of a world where all people were equal, but the very people I had thought wanted that also, suddenly began to turn on my very identity. I saw people attack masculinity and whiteness, and I felt utterly alienated. Like I was a criminal but my only crime was having been born, and these accusations of my own inadequacy weren&#039;t dismissed by the general liberal community, BUT EMBRACED! I was told it was wrong of me to question them, after all, I was not a woman nor was I a person of color. They told me I was pampered by a privileged life and I could never understand those who were different from so I must submit to them as my masters.<br><br>This was when I observed my first case of hypocrisy on the left, when I realized that they didn&#039;t want me unless I would bow to them and that if I followed them I could never truly be a man but only a weak pawn working for the destruction of my own race.<br><br>Once again I was lost and lacked all sense of belonging; that is until I stumbled upon \/pol\/ after following a youtube comment left on one of Sargon of Akkad&#039;s videos mentioning this place. When I arrived I was overwhelmed and dismissed much of the information presented here, however when I realized how equally isolated the people here felt and how they hated things like modern feminism,","filename":"NSDAP","ext":".jpg","w":1000,"h":697,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":174,"tim":1492800999929,"time":1492800999,"md5":"kr1\/YpvARBVrFJSbu5vppw==","fsize":198140,"resto":0,"id":"0uHp+OfO","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"pol-made-me-a-national-socialist","country_name":"United States","replies":9,"images":2,"unique_ips":6},{"no":122169909,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)14:57:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122169852\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122169852<\/a><br>(2\/2)<br><br>I quickly became infatuated with the ideas here. There was never any fear of scrutiny and when I investigated the claims (Racial IQ, The Jewish Question, The Holocaust, Cultural Marxism, Degeneracy, ect.) I was surprised to find a strong foundation of evidence supporting them.<br><br>For my entire life I&#039;ve been ignoring these things and now I saw them everywhere! It was like I had been existing in a totally different reality and now I was finally free from deception. Being an avid reader I was quick to pick up Mein Kampf and listen to the opinions of the man himself. What did I find? An incredible fascination with a man who was just as mentally isolated as I had always felt. I read and read and read and consumed page after page until I was intoxicated with fervor.<br><br>I finally realized, in the F\u00fchrer&#039;s own words (Translated):<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;Just as Nature does not concentrate her greatest attention in preserving what exists, but in breeding offspring to carry on the species, likewise, in human life, it is less important artificially to alleviate existing evil, which, in view of human nature, is ninety-nine per cent impossible, than to ensure to ensure from the start healthier channels for a future development.&quot;<\/span><br><br>In other words: I must change. I must improve my physical and mental condition to lay the seeds for more good. I must make an effort to lay the foundation for breeding goodness before I can ever lead a fight against that which is evil.<br><br>I attended the gym, I continued reading in my spare time, I took better care of my health, my diet, my skin, and my teeth. I got a better haircut and I finally got my first girlfriend and I quit both alcohol and marijuana permanently. My life has never felt so extraordinary in just a year&#039;s time, it&#039;s like I can&#039;t stop making progress and I love every second of it.","time":1492801032,"resto":122169852,"id":"0uHp+OfO","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122169995,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)14:57:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122169852\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122169852<\/a><br><a href=\"#p122169909\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122169909<\/a><br><br>So I would like to say &quot;Thank you&quot; to \/pol\/ for introducing me to National Socialism.

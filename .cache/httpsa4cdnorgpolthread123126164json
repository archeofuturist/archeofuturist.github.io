They&#039;re essentially creating a single religion out of all religions by finding the most common or essential components from each, synthesizing them, and re-branding them as part of a single secret doctrine, a prisca theologia of which they are the overseers. <br><br>In doing this they can more easily convert members of any existing religion into their worldview by claiming that underneath all the layers of cryptic meaning in each religion is one single truth that no single religion can reveal completely. The logical conclusion to this is that Christianity is not the revealed word of God but simply one piece of the puzzle, and the same would apply to any other religion as well. It&#039;s extremely clever and subversive and appeals to the desire of intelligent people to be &quot;in the know&quot; in order to constantly manipulate them into looking towards the order for the truth instead of within themselves as many religions have suggested. <br><br>The nature of the omnireligion they are creating is one that is meant to &quot;liberate&quot; man from the &quot;shackles&quot; of divine faith.

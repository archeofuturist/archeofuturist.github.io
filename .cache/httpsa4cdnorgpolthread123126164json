It&#039;s a fraternal organization that teaches you about magic. REAL magic. However, it was eventually overrun by Satanists and the Illuminati in the 1700s, so now the higher you go up, the more left handed it becomes. Specifically, they teach you about Enochian magic and how to summon spirits to serve you. Albert Pike was a Satanist and basically reformed modern masonry to what it is today. Manly P Hall straight up says in the book &quot;the lost keys of freemasonry&quot; that the initiate will have the seething powers of lucifer at his disposal. Both of these bros were 33rd degree Scottish rite freemasons. Also, other esoteric organizations like rosicruciansm, ordo templi orientis, and the golden dawn basically teach all the same bs except in different ways. You learn about energy, the tree of life,, mediation, sex magic, sacrifices etc etc etc. most freemasons on here are faggots and will never admit to it...until you read one of their own god damn websites where it&#039;s listed:<br><br>http:\/\/www.midnightfreemasons.org\/2<wbr>013\/10\/the-magick-of-king-solomon.h<wbr>tml<br><br>At the higher levels, there are some evil mother fuckers involved in it, and if you&#039;re christian, you should not join.

We could go into the bombing in more detail but honestly I dont think America needs a reason to bomb whoever feel like so no I dont feel particularly betrayed by klumpf because he bombed a shitskin tyrant&#039;s airbase once. Moreover as time passes without further action taken to overthrow Assad, all this outrage starts to become less serious. Kind of like the muh russia claims after months of finding nothing substantial.","time":1493582807,"resto":123500849,"id":"0C4E282N","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123519239,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)16:08:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123500849\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123500849<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\/pol\/ was turned against Trump<\/span><br><br>Yeah fuck trump<br><br>blumpf btfo amirite guys","filename":"shillMan","ext":".jpg","w":740,"h":641,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":108,"tim":1493582886401,"time":1493582886,"md5":"cf7qf\/N2zRVRpo3SwLZjtQ==","fsize":83017,"resto":123500849,"id":"Ep9peXwH","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123519260,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)16:08:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123518724\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123518724<\/a><br>Jesus Christ, you&#039;re fucking retarded.<br>You&#039;re eating pure bluepill.

But from everything that I&#039;ve read, right to work is directly geared to removing unions by removing &#039;union only&#039; contracts and forcing employers to not pay union dues on the worker&#039;s check (deductions for medical\/schooling\/retirement) and also restricting the union from baring workers who don&#039;t pay their dues (typically quarterly payments). This pretty much removes all funding to Unions and effectively ends collective bargaining.<br><br>Now some people might think that the union dues are actually hurting the workers who pay into it while this is pretty far from the truth. For example Iron Workers (Local 1) pay something like $50~ an hour worth in dues on their check and $411 annually HOWEVER every worker receives $55 an hour on their check. To clarify, the dues taken out of their check are taken out before it is actually put onto the check (1 check goes to the union, the other to the worker), so pretty much the iron worker makes around $105 an hour with the $50 taken out of the 105 which makes the annual dues literally pocket change.","time":1493243991,"resto":122938709,"id":"PawU1m3g","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122946608,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)18:02:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122939028\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122939028<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;i just learned about syndicalists the post<\/span><br><br>yeah and next youre going to say anarchism is good. are you 10 years old?","time":1493244120,"resto":122938709,"id":"D3lQW0Xv","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122947795,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)18:11:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122939028\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122939028<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Capitalism must be abolished<\/span><br>Okay you don&#039;t understand what Capitalism is at all.

The R&amp;D on the Internet began in the 50&#039;s after Eisenhower established DARPA in RESPONSE to the then looming Military Industrial Complex when the Cold War began kicking off with the launch of Sputnik. <br><br>When the concept was first proposed by JCR Licklider, the military branches (Navy, Air Force, and Army) thought that it was a silly thing and brushed it off as nonsense. AT&amp;T, the sole owner of telephone landlines also thought the idea to be fruitless, if not impossible. They thought that digital processing of information was silly and that Analog was king. The military and AT&amp;T didn&#039;t really care much for it because they saw no promise in digital electronic technology. The military preferred funding coming from the government to be used instead on weapons research, rather than communications.<br><br>Eisenhower didn&#039;t care, though, and gave the greenlight to DARPA to begin working on this project. From this research came just about every single fundamental aspect of networking that is used today, from packet switching, to information routing, to low latency and high bandwidth, etc. The real reason why this creation and development of the ARPANet began had, in reality, very little to do with the military at all. The real reason was for advanced research agencies and research teams in various universities and such around the country (and overseas) to be able to communicate and share their data on research freely because big ass mainframe computers with time sharing was too cumbersome and ineffective for information sharing on related topics.<br><br>In the early days, the research teams for the ARPANet as it was then called ran into many financing issues, but in the end overcame and produced astounding results, creating a robust network with many redundancies over everything else.

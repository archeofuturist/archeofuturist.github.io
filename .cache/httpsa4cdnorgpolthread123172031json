It was the goddamn pundits he was watching on TV. They were getting it all wrong again as the results of the Iowa caucuses trickled in. Hillary was leading, but it was going to be tight\u2014\u201cOH-EM-GEE!\u201d Wolf Blitzer said on CNN. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t get a whole lot closer than that.\u201d<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;That assessment invited parallels to Hillary\u2019s 2008 loss to Barack Obama. It was, in Bill\u2019s view, an absurd comparison. After all, that had been a three-way race, and she was still likely to come out the winner on this night, not the third-place finisher. But journalists saw an upstart challenger competing with her in Iowa\u2014and d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu was a hard story line to resist. \u201cThis outcome tonight ensures that this race is going to go on for months and months on the Democratic side,\u201d Blitzer\u2019s colleague Jeff Zeleny reported that night from Sanders\u2019s headquarters.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Podesta beckoned Paul with a quick but pointed nod: You go in there and deal with him. Paul gathered himself and walked in to find the former president sitting in a leather chair. Bill was wearing a suit and leather gloves; his arms were crossed. Even if the yelling hadn\u2019t been audible through the walls of the boutique hotel, it would have been clear that he was in a foul mood. His eyes were fixed on Paul. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;If there\u2019s ever a time to make sure I know my shit, the staffer thought, this is it.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Bill fired questions at him. Paul walked Bill through the state, and where caucus results still hadn\u2019t been reported, county by county. Slowly, the president\u2019s anger subsided, even if his anxiety didn\u2019t. Hillary had gotten out to a lead consistent with where her team thought she would be heading into caucus night: <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;She was up a handful of points.

She had been having such episodes for weeks, but she tried to laugh it off. \u201cEvery time I think about Trump, I get allergic,\u201d she joked to the crowd. But there was a more serious political dynamic at play. While she had been raising money in August, Trump had attacked her for not having the \u201cmental and physical stamina\u201d for the presidency. Some of her allies thought it was a sexist line of argument. As a woman, she wasn\u2019t tough enough to hack it, he seemed to be saying. And yet Obama had worried that she was pushing herself too hard when he\u2019d seen her at the convention.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Either way, her struggle to get through the Cleveland speech played right into Trump\u2019s hands. The coughing fit happened at an inauspicious moment for Hillary. For most of the campaign, she had assiduously avoided direct encounters with the national media, going so far as to have aides move a rope to wall them off from her while she walked in a New Hampshire Fourth of July parade in 2015. Labor Day 2016 was the first time her traveling press corps was allowed to fly on her plane. When she went back to chat with them after the Cleveland rally, she was overcome with another coughing fit. Once she recovered, she was, of course, asked whether there was anything to Republican claims that her health had faltered. \u201cI\u2019m not concerned about the conspiracy theories,\u201d she said. \u201cI pay no attention to them.\u201d<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;But this wasn\u2019t a conspiracy theory. Even some of her staff members wondered what was wrong with her. One aide who had traveled with her over the previous several weeks could tell that Hillary was fighting an illness. This woman is coughing a lot, the aide thought. Clearly, she needs antibiotics. But the aide didn\u2019t raise any concerns.<\/span>","filename":"1473195767662","ext":".webm","w":530,"h":652,"tn_w":101,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493373321645,"time":1493373321,"md5":"IvCP+RqZUyDZJ0LMH7Y0SA==","fsize":226072,"resto":123172031,"id":"3LuOnLjv","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123176339,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)05:55:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123176155\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123176155<\/a>","filename":"216","ext":".gif","w":288,"h":216,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1493373333826,"time":1493373333,"md5":"6tm3cJoRfCAUGp3l0cH39w==","fsize":274439,"resto":123172031,"id":"LAtwZZ2Y","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123176350,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)05:55:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123176145\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123176145<\/a><br>I heard today that he and his wife are being investigated for scamming money or some shit.

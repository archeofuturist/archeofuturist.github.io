It was the goddamn pundits he was watching on TV. They were getting it all wrong again as the results of the Iowa caucuses trickled in. Hillary was leading, but it was going to be tight\u2014\u201cOH-EM-GEE!\u201d Wolf Blitzer said on CNN. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t get a whole lot closer than that.\u201d<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;That assessment invited parallels to Hillary\u2019s 2008 loss to Barack Obama. It was, in Bill\u2019s view, an absurd comparison. After all, that had been a three-way race, and she was still likely to come out the winner on this night, not the third-place finisher. But journalists saw an upstart challenger competing with her in Iowa\u2014and d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu was a hard story line to resist. \u201cThis outcome tonight ensures that this race is going to go on for months and months on the Democratic side,\u201d Blitzer\u2019s colleague Jeff Zeleny reported that night from Sanders\u2019s headquarters.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Podesta beckoned Paul with a quick but pointed nod: You go in there and deal with him. Paul gathered himself and walked in to find the former president sitting in a leather chair. Bill was wearing a suit and leather gloves; his arms were crossed. Even if the yelling hadn\u2019t been audible through the walls of the boutique hotel, it would have been clear that he was in a foul mood. His eyes were fixed on Paul. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;If there\u2019s ever a time to make sure I know my shit, the staffer thought, this is it.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Bill fired questions at him. Paul walked Bill through the state, and where caucus results still hadn\u2019t been reported, county by county. Slowly, the president\u2019s anger subsided, even if his anxiety didn\u2019t. Hillary had gotten out to a lead consistent with where her team thought she would be heading into caucus night: <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;She was up a handful of points.

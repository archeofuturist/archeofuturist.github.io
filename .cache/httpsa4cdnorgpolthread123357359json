If this goes through these funds may be what is being used to back a new financial system for the world and fun humanitarian projects. <br><br>http:\/\/neilkeenan.com\/history-event<wbr>s-timeline\/<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;..But specifically the last 100 plus years of the fake western financial system is an outright fraud and deceit on the world. Now finally these murders are being exposed to the people on this planet and it\u2019s finally sinking in that this evil is real and we have been completely fooled by it...<\/span><br><br>...once the Global Collateral Accounts are in order, he will then be able to take care of the matters detailed in the original (fraudulent) 1944 Bretton Woods Agreement.<br><br>This Western-made agreement was a major theft on the whole world but especially to the Non-Aligned Countries with not just the first 1944 Bretton Woods Agreement but also in the second 1995 Agreement...<br><br>The Western Financial System was set up based upon such calculated thefts, and as we have explained, the Western system used Eastern assets from the Global Accounts to achieve all of their goals.<br><br>The history events shown here help you understand the important connection between President Sukarno (M1 &amp; NAM) and President Kennedy. Why was their Green Hilton Memorial Agreement so important for humanity? Some are aware of the gold collateral assets lent to Kennedy, which would allow him to use these asset\/accounts to issue America\u2019s own gold-backed currency \u2018Treasury Notes,\u2019 that would have allowed America to breakaway from the false US Corporation and Federal Reserve (foreign crime cartel) and further dismantle their rogue CIA agency.<br><br>If Kennedy and Sukarno had been successful, America would have been freed from the debt-base bondage system and the secret government. This would also free the G20 nations being controlled by their central banking systems.&quot;","filename":"neil-keenan-timeline-52","ext":".jpg","w":650,"h":203,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":78,"tim":1493487690228,"time":1493487690,"md5":"q4EHEz5Pcplgw5XmqZAuDA==","fsize":64552,"resto":0,"id":"DKYvMPci","country":"VI","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"neil-keenan-and-global-colateral-accounts","country_name":"U.S. Virgin Islands","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":123360143,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)14:06:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123357359\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123357359<\/a><br>just CIA homo funneling and laundering tar budget money.","time":1493489168,"resto":123357359,"id":"higsVEJV","country":"LT","country_name":"Lithuania"}]}

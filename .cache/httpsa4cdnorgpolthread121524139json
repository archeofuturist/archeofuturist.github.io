The Howard government wanted to destroy Hanson and get back those lost voters, but also had no intention of reducing non-white immigration. Instead, they wanted to increase it massively. Howard put Abbott in charge of formulating the government&#039;s response to the Hanson phenomenon. His plan: redirect the focus of the immigration debate from the ever increasing flood of legal immigrants to the numerically insignificant number of illegal immigrants arriving by boat. The plan worked: the debate went from &quot;the Asian invasion&quot; to &quot;stop the boats&quot;, the numbers of immigrants skyrocketed, China and India replaced the UK as the source of most immigration. Abbott was also largely responsible for Hanson being sent to prison on bogus charges that were later overthrown.

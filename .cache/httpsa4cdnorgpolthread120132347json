Despite claims we would stay in the customs union during the campaign this is now not looking so certain and any attempt to stay in the customs union would mean concessions in other areas i.e freedom of movement<br>- I don&#039;t believe migration is bad for the UK, and just to be clear this is about EU nationals migrating, we already have control over non-EU nationals, and to some extent EU nationals as well, the government can ask them to leave, we aren&#039;t in Schengen area etc. I expect businesses who see a reduction in low skilled labour supply will address this problem with automation instead of hiring British workers and generally believe that the threat of automisation is significantly more pressing than migration. <br>- The EU isn\u2019t made up of unelected bureaucrats. We elect MEPs to attend European parliament, as far as I am aware every official is elected by someone, arguing that the EU is unelected carries no more strength than arguing that a neighbouring MP wasn&#039;t elected by anyone in your town? Similarly, Theresa May was only made party leader because everyone else dropped out of the contest yet that\u2019s not an issue?","filename":"brexit","ext":".jpg","w":287,"h":175,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":152,"tim":1491658846760,"time":1491658846,"md5":"9d+ZpZnCFSXuu13FXP1miw==","fsize":10981,"resto":0,"id":"n9xAnyxD","country":"NL","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"how-is-brexit-going-to-benefit-the-uk","country_name":"Netherlands","replies":5,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":120132383,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)09:41:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"- The leaving process prevents the UK from having any input in to the terms of the relationship post-leaving, other than making threats from the side lines. As far as I am aware the UK will be presented with an offer agreed upon by all other members which will then be a yes or no deal, IF they agree on anything at all. Surely it is better to be in the position the UK was already in, with a range of concessions and by far the best deal of any country.<br>- The UK receives a LOT of funding from the EU which helps areas the UK government doesn\u2019t appear to want to spend money on itself. It received the second highest amount of research funding for universities in the EU and government funding has been steadily decreasing for almost 2 decades. Rural areas in particular have also benefitted from EU funding and I am not aware of any promise to match that funding, similarly with agricultural funding.<br>- The \u00a3350million for the NHS was pretty criminal as a campaign tool, I genuinely don\u2019t understand how people believed that the Leave campaign were going to stick to that. <br>- I don\u2019t believe that referendums should be necessary, if anything is it conceding that the country isn\u2019t democratic. This may come down to a more philosophical belief of the role of government but I believe it is to govern in the best interests of the people, rather than to execute the will of the people. In the absence of the general population being able to make informed decisions, which in regards to such a complex issue I don\u2019t believe they can be expected to, it is the role of government to make those decisions with an increased level of understanding. In short, doing what the people want isn\u2019t necessarily the right thing to do.<br><br>Sorry for the long post, just easier than putting down half ideas and then having to explain it all anyway, please can you give views on my points and also provide positives of not being part of the EU.","time":1491658867,"resto":120132347,"id":"n9xAnyxD","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":120133970,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)09:56:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"bump","time":1491659818,"resto":120132347,"id":"n9xAnyxD","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":120135516,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)10:12:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"bump","time":1491660742,"resto":120132347,"id":"n9xAnyxD","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":120135763,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)10:14:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"Short term depends on the deal.<br><br>But I would say if they play it right then it stands to put them in a prime position to take advantage of whatever the future holds for the world.","time":1491660898,"resto":120132347,"id":"I4X4OyFZ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120135767,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)10:14:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120132347\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120132347<\/a><br>To escape EU authoritarianism.

Some of Chang&#039;s sources were terrible or not terribly vetted which led her to draw some exaggerated conclusions. She also claimed the book wasn&#039;t met to read like a polemic anti-Japanese literature but it was as sensationalist as possible anyways. I wouldn&#039;t cite the book as serious scholarship rather pop history, like she was accustomed to writing. I don&#039;t blame Japanese people for hating this book and I see perfectly why the Communist Chinese government loved it.","filename":"1459481904797","ext":".jpg","w":429,"h":411,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":119,"tim":1492506252343,"time":1492506252,"md5":"Bo4EfkC2zOvut+2v9+p3kA==","fsize":78277,"resto":121658201,"id":"AEWBYpDl","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]}

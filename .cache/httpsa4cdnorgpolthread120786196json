The maxim of this is &quot;to each according to his contribution&quot;; the more one contributes to the enterprise the larger share of the profits they will receive. This really incentivizes hard work, those who slack will have to work harder or make due with they get. Hard work will be truly fairly rewarded. Workers will not have to be limited to a certain amount of money for every hour they&#039;re working regardless of how hard they work while slackers and cocksuckers get paid the same or more without doing much real work. Socialism in this manners ensures individuals are rewarded for real contributions of labor and cooperative management accordingly and democratically. There would be no wagecuckery as the wage system would be abolished and no workplace bureaucratic hierarchy.","time":1492024270,"resto":120786196,"id":"hTFmurQZ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120793567,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)15:13:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"I don&#039;t want to share anything with anyone other than people of my own choice.","time":1492024394,"resto":120786196,"id":"5vbeqvch","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120793687,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)15:14:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120790099\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120790099<\/a>","filename":"Screenshot_2017-04-12-15-13-01","ext":".png","w":540,"h":960,"tn_w":70,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492024457128,"time":1492024457,"md5":"G5fJ3sgbitYi543wijcrNQ==","fsize":429970,"resto":120786196,"id":"XMQ4P3Yk","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120793779,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)15:15:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120786196\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120786196<\/a><br>You never had a job that&#039;s for sure.","time":1492024512,"resto":120786196,"id":"rQljH5Uz","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120793822,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)15:15:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120793687\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120793687<\/a><br>I wana slap those udders","time":1492024534,"resto":120786196,"id":"NqN98coD","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120794103,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)15:18:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120786196\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120786196<\/a><br>I&#039;m writing a research paper that covers collectivism and individualism in regards to culture.

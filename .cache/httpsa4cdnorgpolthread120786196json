However, it seems they don&#039;t care to explain why exactly. It&#039;s just a different way of viewing the world, people will point out the abuses or potential pitfalls of such a system or worldview, but how are they any worse than any of the potential dangers or excesses of rampant individualism?<br><br>I&#039;d like to hear reasoned arguments as to why collectivism is inherently worse than individualism, because to me it seems like there needs to be a healthy balance between the two, and with some collectivism, society is much improved via things like improved healthcare systems, infrastructure, public capital and use goods, etc.","filename":"image","ext":".jpg","w":1080,"h":1236,"tn_w":218,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492020836539,"time":1492020836,"md5":"WIsMBqGDlgrWsN042OktlQ==","fsize":217171,"resto":0,"id":"jSjleCkB","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"whats-wrong-with-collectivism","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

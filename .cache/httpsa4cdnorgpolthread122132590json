Our tax for starting a new business is 60% (we are the only country on Earth to PREPAY the following year), and if you add additional tax it goes up to 80% total for the first year. It can reach a total of 96% if it is food related due to strict EU regulations. It is impossible to start a business here, and in 2015 alone about 300.000 companies of an average of 3 employers sunk, with 10% of those being medium size ones.

Add to that flat tax for various reasons, and you are left with about 20-30% of your income.

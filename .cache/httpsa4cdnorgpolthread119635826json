In my own experience, remaining calm when for example being called a racist and staying with my argument or maybe presenting it in a different way is more effective for changing people&#039;s minds than correcting their morality. I know you have no responsibility over your audience&#039;s decisions, but I think it would be smart to show them a more effective way of getting this message of reason and truth across.\u201d","time":1491418153,"resto":119635826,"id":"nbmToVM+","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":119639481,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)14:49:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119636734\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119636734<\/a><br>MIIIIIIIKKKKKKKKEEEEE CUUUUUUUT HIM OOOOOOOOFFFF","time":1491418174,"resto":119635826,"id":"AfM4\/1ng","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119639534,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)14:50:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119639236\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119639236<\/a><br>it depends on what they have to say.","time":1491418200,"resto":119635826,"id":"EI+Wdf\/y","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119639724,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)14:51:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119638138\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119638138<\/a><br><br>They are here from a communist discord.","filename":"03218408243108","ext":".jpg","w":1200,"h":1185,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":123,"tim":1491418281956,"time":1491418281,"md5":"NIzqS1onfvGCxN7cdLD\/wg==","fsize":168455,"resto":119635826,"id":"AfM4\/1ng","country":"CA","m_img":1,"country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119639845,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)14:52:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119639301\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119639301<\/a><br><br>Oh yeah, because if you&#039;re born into an abusive family it&#039;s obviously much better to get beaten to death than to go out and fend for yourself.

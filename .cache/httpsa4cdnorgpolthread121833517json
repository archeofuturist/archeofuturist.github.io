Not a single one. <br><br>Every single boat was &quot;rescued&quot; by NGOs or the Italian Navy and brought to the EU. 95% of the boats used by smugglers can only go out to sea around 15 miles, way short the hundreds of miles required to get to the EU. <br><br>These NGOs are funded by anonymous private donors and post their phone numbers online - smugglers call them directly telling them where to pick up the illegals from the boats. Smugglers then drive the boat back to get more illegals. <br><br>NGO &quot;executives&quot; have argued that what they are doing is God&#039;s work, because in Libya illegals are &quot;not given enough welfare&quot;. These &quot;executives&quot; were mostly unemployed before getting high paying NGO jobs.","filename":"Screen Shot 2017-04-19 at 1.23.23 PM","ext":".png","w":1006,"h":1014,"tn_w":248,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492601233419,"time":1492601233,"md5":"qumL7OeiymPmOggemz+1iA==","fsize":1093395,"resto":0,"id":"5HikPPVd","country":"DE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"daily-reminder-that-12-ngos-safe-illegals-right","country_name":"Germany","replies":2,"images":2,"unique_ips":2},{"no":121835853,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)07:57:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121833517\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121833517<\/a><br>NGOs are corrupt, traitorous fucks exploiting useful idiots for EU shekels and possibly working with smugglers and the Mafia.<br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=BzZ<wbr>6--p01KM<br><br>Refugees are a business, some Italian broke down how it works a while ago.

But I&#039;m not very sympathetic anymore. What the fuck are you guys complaining about anymore? We&#039;ve given you everything.<br><br>More than any other group, I feel like the &quot;LGBT&quot; community WANTS to be &quot;oppressed&quot;. I&#039;m sorry you feel like you don&#039;t fit in, but that&#039;s not society&#039;s responsibility. The rest of us aren&#039;t obligated to celebrate the fact that you like to stick your dick in another dude&#039;s ass. I just don&#039;t give a shit. Get that through your fucking head.","filename":"IKillGays","ext":".jpg","w":580,"h":435,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":187,"tim":1491522604913,"time":1491522604,"md5":"rlRUP7kjwnu\/WyBjg1DuMA==","fsize":38941,"resto":0,"id":"mhIsfXzy","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"honestly-fuck-gays","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":119818899,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)19:57:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"I honestly haven&#039;t heard anything about gays in years, they&#039;re just there and nobody really cares anymore","time":1491523032,"resto":119817936,"id":"0VlKOdRn","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119820316,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)20:08:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119818899\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119818899<\/a><br>this","time":1491523689,"resto":119817936,"id":"Me7O7OWJ","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]}

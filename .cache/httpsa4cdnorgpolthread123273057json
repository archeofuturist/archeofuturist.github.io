They will receive a new challenge every day, for 50 days, and have to provide photographic proof of its achievement. At first they have to watch horror movies, stay up late or wake up at specific hours, go hang around at night in bizarre locations, but the challenges get more extreme by the day - self mutilation, carving a whale or certain texts in your flesh, banging your head against a wall....eventually, to &quot;beat&quot; the game and &quot;win&quot; you have to commit suicide.

It is the ultimate and absolute evil, the refusal to take an interest in existence; the refusal to take the oath of loyalty to life. The man who kills a man, kills a man. The man who kills himself, kills all men; as far as he is concerned he wipes out the world. His act is worse (symbolically considered) than any rape or dynamite outrage. For it destroys all buildings: it insults all women. The thief is satisfied with diamonds; but the suicide is not: that is his crime. He cannot be bribed, even by the blazing stones of the Celestial City. The thief compliments the things he steals, if not the owner of them. But the suicide insults everything on earth by not stealing it. He defiles every flower by refusing to live for its sake. There is not a tiny creature in the cosmos at whom his death is not a sneer. When a man hangs himself on a tree, the leaves might fall off in anger and the birds fly away in fury: for each has received a personal affront. Of course there may be pathetic emotional excuses for the act. There often are for rape, and there almost always are for dynamite. But if it comes to clear ideas and the intelligent meaning of things, then there is much more rational and philosophic truth in the burial at the cross-roads and the stake driven through the body, than in Mr. Archer&#039;s suicidal automatic machines. There is a meaning in burying the suicide apart. The man&#039;s crime is different from other crimes -- for it makes even crimes impossible.<br><br>-G.K.

They will receive a new challenge every day, for 50 days, and have to provide photographic proof of its achievement. At first they have to watch horror movies, stay up late or wake up at specific hours, go hang around at night in bizarre locations, but the challenges get more extreme by the day - self mutilation, carving a whale or certain texts in your flesh, banging your head against a wall....eventually, to &quot;beat&quot; the game and &quot;win&quot; you have to commit suicide.

It is the ultimate and absolute evil, the refusal to take an interest in existence; the refusal to take the oath of loyalty to life. The man who kills a man, kills a man. The man who kills himself, kills all men; as far as he is concerned he wipes out the world. His act is worse (symbolically considered) than any rape or dynamite outrage. For it destroys all buildings: it insults all women. The thief is satisfied with diamonds; but the suicide is not: that is his crime. He cannot be bribed, even by the blazing stones of the Celestial City. The thief compliments the things he steals, if not the owner of them. But the suicide insults everything on earth by not stealing it. He defiles every flower by refusing to live for its sake. There is not a tiny creature in the cosmos at whom his death is not a sneer. When a man hangs himself on a tree, the leaves might fall off in anger and the birds fly away in fury: for each has received a personal affront. Of course there may be pathetic emotional excuses for the act. There often are for rape, and there almost always are for dynamite. But if it comes to clear ideas and the intelligent meaning of things, then there is much more rational and philosophic truth in the burial at the cross-roads and the stake driven through the body, than in Mr. Archer&#039;s suicidal automatic machines. There is a meaning in burying the suicide apart. The man&#039;s crime is different from other crimes -- for it makes even crimes impossible.<br><br>-G.K.

I have to disagree with you, and I wonder if you even have the credentials in which you state.<br><br>Yes, the show has a lot of bullshit, but the underlying theme does not romanticize suicide - in my opinion. I think thats a very superficial understanding of what is going on. The girl portrayed in the series experiences stressor after stressor, with no real support system to help her get through tough times. Cries for help are met with finger-pointing and shame. Every friend betrays her. She loses status amongst her peers. A strong feeling of hopelessness is very clearly demonstrated. Yes, she seems like a vindictive bitch at times, but as someone who lost a friend to suicide, this show does not look romanticized at all. Even violent episodes are met with warnings at the beginning of them.<br><br>Again, this was a very fast binge through to understand what the fuss was about. I had it playing in the background while I was working, but I think I&#039;ve seen enough to say this silencing of speech that is taking place at school is BS. Do I think it is a good show? Not really. But I get why its become so popular amongst the younger generation. Your comments make me think you are simply parroting what news articles printed, since they are word for word the arguments being published against discussing this anywhere near school","filename":"Screen Shot 2017-04-29 at 5.17.19 AM","ext":".png","w":2195,"h":1467,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1493457523235,"time":1493457523,"md5":"tI73JajEnexGRcGlCyKQfQ==","fsize":111538,"resto":123273057,"id":"\/a\/O8hYh","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123316228,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)05:22:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123276909\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123276909<\/a><br>Wow.

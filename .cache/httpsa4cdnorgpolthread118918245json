Recently I&#039;ve come across former Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney&#039;s interview where she claims Congress candidates must sign loyalty to israel and decided to do some digging.

Bush may have been aware and allowed them to happen,<br> allegedly due to his father&#039;s business interests: &#039;It is known that President Bush&#039;s father, through The Carlyle Group,<br> had\u2013at the time of the attacks\u2013joint business interests with the bin Laden construction company and many defense industry<br> holdings, the stocks of which have soared since September 11.&#039;&quot; - https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/2002090<wbr>3222124\/http:\/\/www.usnews.com\/usnew<wbr>s\/opinion\/baroneweb\/mb_020829.htm \/ https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Cynth<wbr>ia_McKinney<br><br>The Carlyle Group:<br> - George Bush Sr. had business interests<br> - Multinational private equity, alternative asset management and financial services corporation<br> - corporate private equity, real assets, global market strategies, and investment solutions<br> - more than 1,700 employees across 35 offices in North America, South America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia and Australia<br> - Founders William E.

I couldn&#039;t find any documents pertaining to any children he may have had. I know it&#039;s a long shot that Daniel A.

In pic related, the cameras apeture is opened enough for enough photons to strike the sensors, which include star light. Notice how much more pronounced the atmosphere is. This is also taken in the earths shadow, imagine what would happen if you did this during the day, the planet would be overexposed and white.","filename":"bait","ext":".jpg","w":990,"h":658,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1493619342127,"time":1493619342,"md5":"7ZfR6aYnY7+HvPuzp6mpcg==","fsize":209882,"resto":123570207,"id":"djugPSqo","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":123587206,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)02:15:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123582537\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123582537<\/a><br>This is some real red pill.","time":1493619357,"resto":123570207,"id":"LlRLnKc4","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123587353,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)02:18:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123587189\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123587189<\/a><br>when flat earthers send balloons into space you can see the stars just fine you dont have to fuck with the exposure levels<br><br>hahaha get cucked","filename":"tumblr_oe4m4sn65R1t4mby8o1_1280","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":1920,"tn_w":83,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493619484023,"time":1493619484,"md5":"yjcXD\/VzmDZCI9N2US+fmQ==","fsize":752626,"resto":123570207,"id":"jrgw1xu9","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":123587509,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)02:19:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123587353\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123587353<\/a><br><br>But how do those flat earthers send balloons passed the glass sky? also your contradicting your previous post.

Have a friend travel a hundred miles or so north or south, both of you, at the same time of day on the same day, put a stick in the ground and measure the shadow. The shadow and stick form a 90 degree angle, tie a string to the top of the stick and steak it in the ground at the tip of the shadow, the angle between the string and the stick is the angle that the sun&#039;s rays are hitting the earth at due to the curvature of the earth. You and your friend will have a different angle. Bonus: Take the difference between the two angles and divide it by 360 then multiply that by the distance and you get a very close to the circumference of the Earth.","time":1493620116,"resto":123570207,"id":"WLVbNRxb","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123588233,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)02:28:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123587681\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123587681<\/a><br><br>how is it possible to make 2 right turns on our &quot;flat earth&quot; and arrive at the same destination?","filename":"Bait2","ext":".jpg","w":1122,"h":543,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":60,"tim":1493620129906,"time":1493620129,"md5":"lEPJqrAs65IDBeREb2z9ag==","fsize":183308,"resto":123570207,"id":"djugPSqo","country":"AU","m_img":1,"country_name":"Australia"},{"no":123588425,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)02:31:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123588097\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123588097<\/a><br>see <a href=\"#p123587681\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123587681<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;planets &gt; existing<\/span><br><br><a href=\"#p123588215\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123588215<\/a><br>actually theres been laser experiments where the laser lands at the exact same point miles later","filename":"tumblr_oi6jvsIFhW1t4mby8o6_1280","ext":".jpg","w":1200,"h":1200,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493620281352,"time":1493620281,"md5":"gA352b8YEWz+1VXJXKxKbA==","fsize":159497,"resto":123570207,"id":"jrgw1xu9","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":123588474,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)02:31:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123574569\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123574569<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;lots of ancient religions thought the world was flat<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;ancient religions have never been wrong<\/span><br><br>Pick one","time":1493620319,"resto":123570207,"id":"LFHXj8e9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123588568,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)02:33:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123570207\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123570207<\/a><br>So what was Galileo&#039;s master plan when he announced the earth was rotating around the sun?","time":1493620398,"resto":123570207,"id":"LFHXj8e9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123588587,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)02:33:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123576021\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123576021<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;No Apollo 13<\/span><br><br>They can&#039;t even keep their story straight.","filename":"face1","ext":".png","w":120,"h":120,"tn_w":120,"tn_h":120,"tim":1493620410825,"time":1493620410,"md5":"1A7IhjItFPb+ZdX4QBnDBg==","fsize":18482,"resto":123570207,"id":"f0\/AGKBw","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123588733,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)02:35:29","name":"Anonymous","filename":"out","ext":".webm","w":1280,"h":720,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1493620529710,"time":1493620529,"md5":"yjai1CXvItOx+0KtOuMgXg==","fsize":3076765,"resto":123570207,"id":"Eo9Mk9rd","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":123588796,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)02:36:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123574717\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123574717<\/a><br>The moment when you forget what gravity is and never under stood centrifugal or centripetal forces","time":1493620587,"resto":123570207,"id":"LFHXj8e9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123589165,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)02:41:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"Damn you flat Earth trolls, you made Eddie go full retard.","filename":"edgybrah","ext":".jpg","w":388,"h":395,"tn_w":122,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493620870323,"time":1493620870,"md5":"75szAw\/4FeM95YM9692wkw==","fsize":41657,"resto":123570207,"id":"n+3fPTM6","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":123589201,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)02:41:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123575033\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123575033<\/a><br>Get on a ship.

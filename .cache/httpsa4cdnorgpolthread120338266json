This has turned out to be true, while being applauded by his erstwhile detractors for doing so, emboldening him to go further. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Yet \u201cI\u2019m no fan of Trump, but \u2026\u201d will be the battle cry of his erstwhile detractors. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Still, the children of Syria will die, just as they will die in Yemen and Iraq and elsewhere. History will ask: how did this man become president? And how did he maintain power when he did? Look no further than the brittle, weak, pathetic liberal \u201copposition\u201d. The US deserves better, and so does the world.<\/span><br><br>https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/comment<wbr>isfree\/2017\/apr\/09\/liberals-donald-<wbr>trump-syria-missile-strikes","filename":"Screen Shot 2017-04-09 at 22.11.31","ext":".png","w":753,"h":377,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491772556902,"time":1491772556,"md5":"\/8\/bCYUlXGBDTKGH1hCORA==","fsize":218558,"resto":0,"id":"Gbu+br54","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"why-are-liberals-now-cheerleading-a-warmongering","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

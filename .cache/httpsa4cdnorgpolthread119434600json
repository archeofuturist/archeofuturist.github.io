Gross revenues from a well-designed FTT would likely range from $110 billion to $403 billion. And net revenues (including offsets from reduced income, payroll and capital gains taxes, and increased borrowing costs) would likely be substantially higher than some other recent estimates indicate.<\/span><br>this was famously tried by Sweden in the 80s<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In January 1984, Sweden introduced a 0.5% tax on the purchase or sale of an equity security. Hence, a round trip (purchase and sale) transaction resulted in a 1% tax. <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;During the first week of the tax, the volume of bond trading fell by 85%, even though the tax rate on five-year bonds was only 0.003%. The volume of futures trading fell by 98% and the options trading market disappeared.[1] 60% of the trading volume of the eleven most actively traded Swedish share classes moved to the UK after the announcement in 1986 that the tax rate would double. 30% of all Swedish equity trading moved offshore. By 1990, more than 50% of all Swedish trading had moved to London. Foreign investors reacted to the tax by moving their trading offshore while domestic investors reacted by reducing the number of their equity trades.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;As a result, revenues from these taxes were disappointing. For example, revenues from the tax on fixed-income securities were initially expected to amount to 1,500 million Swedish kronor per year. They did not amount to more than 80 million Swedish kronor in any year and the average was closer to 50 million.<\/span><br>the fucking morons","filename":"confus","ext":".jpg","w":631,"h":603,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":119,"tim":1491283312676,"time":1491283312,"md5":"pNFopqY7Ct9rXzkhnQI\/0Q==","fsize":44866,"resto":119434600,"id":"yIZSRONS","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119435273,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)01:22:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;i will back and pass a bill that eliminates all federal student loan debt accrued by american citizens after 1990, contingent on the removal of all illegal immigrants and the revocation of birthright citizenship for all applicable persons born after 1990<\/span><br>would the bernie people go for it?","filename":"1470255269863","ext":".png","w":312,"h":300,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":120,"tim":1491283326521,"time":1491283326,"md5":"o2U3QehfmRC8mjjRAc74gA==","fsize":171867,"resto":119434600,"id":"hgREMxiK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119435274,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)01:22:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119434927\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119434927<\/a><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/Qn7rCt531RY<br><br>Sieg heil baby","filename":"1487210895278","ext":".jpg","w":735,"h":500,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":85,"tim":1491283326005,"time":1491283326,"md5":"oh6OWHiSxgdN3roj5Skjeg==","fsize":90638,"resto":119434600,"id":"jfj7gv3R","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119435323,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)01:22:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119435259\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119435259<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;small levy placed on the sale of stocks, bonds, derivatives, and other investments<\/span><br><br>RIP retirement funds, pensions plans, and all investment-backed resources.","time":1491283365,"resto":119434600,"id":"yzSAxF2r","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119435327,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)01:22:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119434842\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119434842<\/a><br><a href=\"#p119435259\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119435259<\/a>","time":1491283370,"resto":119434600,"id":"yIZSRONS","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119435350,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)01:23:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119435253\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119435253<\/a><br>Better in color.","filename":"MAGAJewels","ext":".jpg","w":980,"h":1448,"tn_w":84,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491283386760,"time":1491283386,"md5":"a5eZxTQc2seiQeR4m4+DVQ==","fsize":910444,"resto":119434600,"id":"yDVSuo8\/","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":119435360,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)01:23:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119435253\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119435253<\/a><br>*ADD","time":1491283395,"resto":119434600,"id":"z0e31FYP","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119435377,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)01:23:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119435274\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119435274<\/a><br>This shit still makes me smile.","filename":"1484165116821","ext":".jpg","w":472,"h":398,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":105,"tim":1491283403786,"time":1491283403,"md5":"Uhcz7f2WNFt4NdhceL0LJg==","fsize":37144,"resto":119434600,"id":"0OI6sQIe","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119435379,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)01:23:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119435239\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119435239<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Women&#039;s studies degrees are useful.<\/span><br>Faggotry.

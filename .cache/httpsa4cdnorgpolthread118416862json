I work in fast food, I earn 9.50 an hour. I&#039;m doing fucking fine. I did fine before my dollar raise. I&#039;m not rich, but I pay my bills and have a couple hundred extra each month. If your earning min wage ( in TX where I am currently is 7.25) and you can&#039;t get another job somewhere else doing the same thing for higher pay, then your just not trying. Walk up to any decent restaurant apply to be a dish washer, boom. Entry level 11-13 an hour. Here&#039;s some tips. Stop buying fucking weed. Don&#039;t buy the most expensive shit on the market, don&#039;t act like you have more than you have and just work on getting there. Put your income on a spreadsheet and see where that shit goes and cut off the useless shit like fast food.","time":1490563381,"resto":118416862,"id":"1\/Jr67Q5","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118417820,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)17:23:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118416862\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118416862<\/a><br>the point in minimum wage is to make dumb people happy, when it goes up they think everything will be fixed and they keep their politicians in office. the minimum wage will always be below a living wage because minimum wage work is simple enough for children and old people to do.","time":1490563411,"resto":118416862,"id":"FQPucNDY","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118417937,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)17:24:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118417757\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118417757<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I earn 9.50 an hour.

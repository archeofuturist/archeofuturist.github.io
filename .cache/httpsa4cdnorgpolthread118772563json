Several countries started to go on spending sprees, making massive tax breaks coupled with expensive social policies like low retirement ages, ample breaks\/time off work, pensions, public spending, etc. They kept running deficits and procrastinated the bill to a later day. Then in 2008, the credit bubble burst and creditors weren&#039;t willing to keep lending to the PIIGS, and without money to foot the bills, they turned to Germany for cash. Germany started to negotiate austerity measures and countries like Greece protested because they felt like they were being manipulated by them. Germany just saw the Greeks as lazy and who couldn&#039;t keep up their way of life without improving their labour market productivity and cutting out some of these lavish social policies which they can&#039;t sustain economically.<br><br>The story goes a lot longer, but the gist is that Germany has subordinated many of the smaller European countries to their will, given that they have significant influence over their economies. And cleverly, whether it planned this from the beginning or not (I think they did), Germany has used the PIIGS&#039; economic mismanagement as an excuse to pass &quot;fiscal policies&quot; across the entire continent, basically creating a political union. Their reasoning is that they need to enforce a common set of laws on economic spending policies, and constant judicial implementation of those laws, to make sure that countries don&#039;t simply abuse the Euro and spend at a level that the rest of Europe has a say in deciding.<br><br>This &quot;fiscal union&quot; shrinks national political power over important topics. For example, EU countries have no control over intra-EU immigration.","time":1490784285,"resto":118772563,"id":"BzxYK9pO","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"}]}

Braindead. Lemme give you a tip so you can make it in this cyber sanctuary: never make jokes like that. You got no reputation here, you got no name, you got jackshit here. It&#039;s survival of the fittest and you ain&#039;t gonna survive long on 4chan by saying stupid jokes that your little hugbox cuntsucking reddit friends would upboat. None of that here. You don&#039;t upboat. You don&#039;t downboat. This ain&#039;t reddit, kid. This is 4chan. We have REAL intellectual discussion, something I don&#039;t think you&#039;re all that familiar with. You don&#039;t like it, you can hit the bricks on over to imgur, you daily show watching son of a bitch. I hope you don&#039;t tho. I hope you stay here and learn our ways. Things are different here, unlike any other place that the light of internet pop culture reaches. You can be anything here. Me ? heh, I&#039;m a judge.. this place.... this place has a lot to offer... heh you&#039;ll see, kid . . . that is if you can handle it...","time":1490852980,"resto":118884520,"id":"nR5fyFJs","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118890338,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)01:49:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118890126\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118890126<\/a><br>Then how will we civil war ii?","filename":"549px-Freedomisworthfiightingbasedstickmanfashwave","ext":".png","w":549,"h":600,"tn_w":114,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490852988001,"time":1490852988,"md5":"sqp+HG8u3TXohknz3iJwjA==","fsize":586948,"resto":118884520,"id":"USwGcY5g","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118890421,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)01:50:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118884520\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118884520<\/a><br>Do none of you own?

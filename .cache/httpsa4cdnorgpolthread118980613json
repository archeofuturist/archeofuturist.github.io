The signi\ufb01cance of the differences in brain size is not clear in our species. For example, the English poet Lord Byron (1788\u20131824) seems to have had a great brain,as demonstrated not only by the quality of his writings but also by the size of his enormous brain, weighing 2,238 kg. Oliver Cromwell (1599\u20131658), protector of the Republic of England, also had a brain that weighed between 2,233 and 2,330 kg, whereas the French writer Anatole France (1844\u20131924), who won the Nobel Prize for literature in 1921, had a brain that weighed only 1,100 kg (DeFelipe 2011). Asfar as we know, the smallestbrain reported in a normalperson is the case of Daniel Lyons, who died in 1907 at the age of 41. Daniel was a person with no special features, with a normal body weight and of normal intelligence, although his brain weighed no more than 680 g (Wilder 1911). Thus, it appears that a difference of almost 50 % of brain mass, with its billions of neurons and synapses, may have no functional signi\ufb01cance in terms of intelligence.

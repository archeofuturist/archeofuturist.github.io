Or perhaps schools should have after-school music lessons for a standard fee. All students should learn how to play an instrument by the time they&#039;re in middle school .Learning an instrument increases IQ by 4 points and teaches discipline. Also, the reason modern music gone to shit is because parents arent teaching their kids music and so they don&#039;t learn to appreciate folk, blues or classical music and they get hooked on to shitty trap and hip hip music . Most of the greatest Rock stars were classically trained musicians.","filename":"7509842750983242","ext":".jpg","w":384,"h":416,"tn_w":230,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491957665267,"time":1491957665,"md5":"oYKz0vk+\/niIcyOaVl8x6Q==","fsize":148495,"resto":0,"id":"e3zE9gQ2","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"school-should-replace-worthless-art-classes-with","country_name":"United States","replies":4,"images":1,"unique_ips":5},{"no":120686989,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)20:46:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"manditory (((music))) classes mean every kid is 4th grade is forced to half ass playing a recorder for a few weeks.<br><br>Save music for people who actually care about it","filename":"1491172842168 (1)","ext":".png","w":1280,"h":720,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1491957977199,"time":1491957977,"md5":"JNdBeG2JHpUOHrryViDnWw==","fsize":802171,"resto":120686333,"id":"j1gQ1+7y","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":120688125,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)20:55:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"It will only lead to deification of kanye.","time":1491958511,"resto":120686333,"id":"+C9WhwZ+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120688297,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)20:56:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120686989\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120686989<\/a><br>Everyone should be required to learn to play 1 real instrument in their 12 years of public schooling.

Screencap this. Really shaky times!<br><br>WASHINGTON (AP) - The White House refused Thursday to say whether it secretly fed intelligence reports to a top Republican lawmaker, fueling concerns about political interference in the investigation into possible coordination between Russia and the 2016 Trump campaign. Fending off the growing criticism, the administration invited lawmakers from both parties to view classified material it said relates to surveillance of the president&#039;s associates. The invitation came as The New York Times reported that two White House officials - including an aide whose job was recently saved by President Donald Trump - secretly helped House intelligence committee chairman Devin Nunes examine intelligence information last week.<br><br>Sources close to the Trump Campaign are alluding to President Donald J. Trump stepping down from office and resigning in fear of facing impeachment proceedings. This will be the first weekend where President Trump will not be going to Mar-a-Lago, his commonly known &quot;Southern White House&quot; as many speculate that President Trump will be buckling down on these new allegations that he had colluded with Russia and had help from Russia&#039;s leader, Vladimir Putin. <br><br>The source also stated to media that the entire campaign is in frenzy mode and that all people are now making the appropriate measures to bolster ties with Vice President Michael Pence. &quot;Everything is in a total state of chaos here, Trump could be facing criminal charges and if that were to happen, it would cause an immediate investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (sic) into tampering with the election which could bring about totally different results in which case Hillary R. Clinton could be named the actual victor in the presidential election (sic) - this would be much, much larger and more scandalous in nature than Watergate.&quot;<br><br>DEVELOPING STORY","time":1490938722,"resto":119025671,"id":"M53iMKgl","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119025788,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)01:39:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119025671\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119025671<\/a><br>Daily reminder that anti-Russian shilling is coming from the exact same source that anti-German shilling began to come from in the late 1930s<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Preparations inside Russia are being made in case the ultimate banking sanctions are placed on them, cutting off commerce inside the all-encompassing Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecomm SWIFT system \u2013 which runs credit, debt, and banking card transactions across a real time global network.

Don&#039;t most governments have press releases and ways to shape coverage in a particular way (propaganda)? The U.S. has Voice of America. Obama&#039;s press secretary manipulated the media, bragging he could get them to print anything he said, and they wouldn&#039;t fact check. <br>2) Let&#039;s pretend Russia did release propaganda. Are you saying it was more effective than the 24\/7 shilling on CNN, NBC, MSNBC, etc.? They ran non-stop critical coverage of Trump. Who&#039;s going to argue against the propaganda used to benefit Hillary? Example: For every 23 minutes they talked about the access Hollywood tape, they ran one minute on Wikileaks. Is that fair?<br>3) When are we going to start the investigations into our interference in other countries&#039; politics? Example: France in 2012. Is it ok for us to mess with elections, but just no one can mess with us? Or what about sponsoring coups (example: Honduras, arming rebels in Syria, etc.)?<br>4) They&#039;ve mentioned RT as Russia&#039;s propaganda outlet. Ignoring the fact that the coverage was actually more balanced than CNN&#039;s, are you saying RT is more influential than all of the channels that slammed Trump? Trump barely had the support of Fox News. Half of the anchors would regularly blast him.","filename":"IMG_5093","ext":".jpg","w":986,"h":814,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":103,"tim":1490940275740,"time":1490940275,"md5":"RxNwOHmddIiVFmjfB8d\/7Q==","fsize":116267,"resto":119025671,"id":"RTtkzo\/m","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119027796,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)02:04:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119027708\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119027708<\/a><br>THANK YOU SEAN","time":1490940283,"resto":119025671,"id":"Zm2fEFQb","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119027812,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)02:04:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119027633\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119027633<\/a><br>Assuming the letter is real (probably is), the WSJ spun the story as immunity plea bargain.

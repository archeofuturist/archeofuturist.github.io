What an irony of history, that this university&#039;s &quot;Antifa&quot; group, calling themselves the Anti-Deutschen Antifa (anti-German anti-fascists), attacked the organization that has brought to international attention the importance of Berlin&#039;s leading Orthodox Jew of the 18th Century, Moses Mendelssohn (a philosopher who was known as the &quot;Socrates of Berlin&quot;).<br><br>The so-called anti-fascists claimed to be attacking on behalf of the Jews of Israel, who are in fact the victims of the criminal policies of Dick Cheney&#039;s imperial war party and its allies in Israel. Humboldt University was founded by Wilhelm von Humboldt, who, along with his brother Alexander, were raised in that rich cultural tradition marked by Moses Mendelssohn&#039;s and Gotthold Lessing&#039;s 1755 defense of Leibniz and Plato. Mendelssohn and Lessing, as young men, having newly met in Berlin, perhaps only a few years older then today&#039;s Antifa stormtroopers, launched a cultural renaissance, and in the process secured a place in history for Jews in Germany, unparalleled since the days of Moses, Philo of Alexandria, and Maimonides in 12th-Century Egypt.<br><br>The bizarre Antifa-Autonomist political sect emerged to take leadership of the radical &quot;scene&quot; under the new, aggressive &quot;Anti-Deutschen&quot; label. They have become the street component to their high-level backers who are running protection for the hedge funds, private-equity takeover funds, and the banks that are out to eliminate sovereign governments&#039; interference in their global power. With the Anti-Deutschen, resistance to the globalization onslaught is slandered as anti-American and anti-Semitic.","time":1493429015,"resto":123273861,"id":"mRsmHD1u","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123276965,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)21:25:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123276729\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123276729<\/a><br>that is an excerpt about antifa and their connection to israel and the orthodox jews<br><br>don&#039;t be fooled, these are all part of the same network<br><br>NAMBLA&#039;s connection to the jews<br><br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Allen<wbr>_Ginsberg<br><br>this is the weimar republic<br><br>the fire rises","filename":"rush-limbaugh-bane-controversy","ext":".jpg","w":550,"h":600,"tn_w":114,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493429136042,"time":1493429136,"md5":"jA1pDf+UPJErphKyO3E2Sg==","fsize":47493,"resto":123273861,"id":"mRsmHD1u","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123277285,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)21:28:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123274043\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123274043<\/a><br><a href=\"#p123274387\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123274387<\/a><br><br>SHUT IT DOWN","filename":"shills","ext":".png","w":1249,"h":787,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":78,"tim":1493429302563,"time":1493429302,"md5":"QeSTqMPQwJvNZZn4wt+adA==","fsize":160169,"resto":123273861,"id":"19ZL54VK","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123277465,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)21:29:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123276965\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123276965<\/a><br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hoshe<wbr>n_(organization)<br><br>there is your Israeli NAMBLA connection<br><br>&quot;Among the recommendations to kindergarten teachers and their assistants: Eliminating the concept of &#039;father and mother of the Sabbath&#039; classroom role-playing; deliberate identity confusion: No dolls for girls, no boy&#039;s games; providing a female role model for male professions; explaining to kindergarten children that there is a wide range of family units, including for example: two mothers, or two fathers, or a mother and father who live apart, or the mother and her friend, or the father and his friend (for 4-year-olds)!!??<br><br>http:\/\/www.israelnationalnews.com\/N<wbr>ews\/News.aspx\/226679<br><br>good for thee white men, not for me<br><br>do you feel angry yet?<br><br>are you ready to rise in protest?<br><br>it is your time brothers<br><br>the fire rises","filename":"fb94af74669149f682912985e80b43c6","ext":".jpg","w":550,"h":550,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493429397000,"time":1493429397,"md5":"gVSbUQ4dQq31dWnjAqArkQ==","fsize":57023,"resto":123273861,"id":"mRsmHD1u","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123277705,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)21:32:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"Looks like they&#039;re funded by siphoning money out of the Oakland teachers union.

That report does not list NCMEC\u2019s donors, because donors have a First Amendment right to remain anonymous, but a more transparent organization would, like my own think tank, at least identify its major donors. NCMEC\u2019s CEO, Ernie Allen, was paid $359,191 plus $411,636 in benefits in 2006 (PDF p. 46) and $409,821 plus $426,540 in benefits in 2007 (PDF p. 19), for a total of $1.6 million in two years (roughly $800,000\/year); I\u2019d be reluctant to suggest that anyone at NCMEC was more interested in money than in ernieallenprotecting children, but if given the choice, we\u2019d all prefer to do well while doing good. So if Allen were smart, he\u2019d realize that a court order subjecting NCMEC to FOIA might be the best of all possible worlds: Requiring real accountability would neutralize calls for nationalizing NCMEC, allowing the organization to continue operating as a non-profit that can pay quite a bit better than the Federal civil service.

What an irony of history, that this university&#039;s &quot;Antifa&quot; group, calling themselves the Anti-Deutschen Antifa (anti-German anti-fascists), attacked the organization that has brought to international attention the importance of Berlin&#039;s leading Orthodox Jew of the 18th Century, Moses Mendelssohn (a philosopher who was known as the &quot;Socrates of Berlin&quot;).<br><br>The so-called anti-fascists claimed to be attacking on behalf of the Jews of Israel, who are in fact the victims of the criminal policies of Dick Cheney&#039;s imperial war party and its allies in Israel. Humboldt University was founded by Wilhelm von Humboldt, who, along with his brother Alexander, were raised in that rich cultural tradition marked by Moses Mendelssohn&#039;s and Gotthold Lessing&#039;s 1755 defense of Leibniz and Plato. Mendelssohn and Lessing, as young men, having newly met in Berlin, perhaps only a few years older then today&#039;s Antifa stormtroopers, launched a cultural renaissance, and in the process secured a place in history for Jews in Germany, unparalleled since the days of Moses, Philo of Alexandria, and Maimonides in 12th-Century Egypt.<br><br>The bizarre Antifa-Autonomist political sect emerged to take leadership of the radical &quot;scene&quot; under the new, aggressive &quot;Anti-Deutschen&quot; label. They have become the street component to their high-level backers who are running protection for the hedge funds, private-equity takeover funds, and the banks that are out to eliminate sovereign governments&#039; interference in their global power. With the Anti-Deutschen, resistance to the globalization onslaught is slandered as anti-American and anti-Semitic.","time":1493429015,"resto":123273861,"id":"mRsmHD1u","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123276965,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)21:25:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123276729\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123276729<\/a><br>that is an excerpt about antifa and their connection to israel and the orthodox jews<br><br>don&#039;t be fooled, these are all part of the same network<br><br>NAMBLA&#039;s connection to the jews<br><br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Allen<wbr>_Ginsberg<br><br>this is the weimar republic<br><br>the fire rises","filename":"rush-limbaugh-bane-controversy","ext":".jpg","w":550,"h":600,"tn_w":114,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493429136042,"time":1493429136,"md5":"jA1pDf+UPJErphKyO3E2Sg==","fsize":47493,"resto":123273861,"id":"mRsmHD1u","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123277285,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)21:28:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123274043\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123274043<\/a><br><a href=\"#p123274387\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123274387<\/a><br><br>SHUT IT DOWN","filename":"shills","ext":".png","w":1249,"h":787,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":78,"tim":1493429302563,"time":1493429302,"md5":"QeSTqMPQwJvNZZn4wt+adA==","fsize":160169,"resto":123273861,"id":"19ZL54VK","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123277465,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)21:29:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123276965\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123276965<\/a><br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hoshe<wbr>n_(organization)<br><br>there is your Israeli NAMBLA connection<br><br>&quot;Among the recommendations to kindergarten teachers and their assistants: Eliminating the concept of &#039;father and mother of the Sabbath&#039; classroom role-playing; deliberate identity confusion: No dolls for girls, no boy&#039;s games; providing a female role model for male professions; explaining to kindergarten children that there is a wide range of family units, including for example: two mothers, or two fathers, or a mother and father who live apart, or the mother and her friend, or the father and his friend (for 4-year-olds)!!??<br><br>http:\/\/www.israelnationalnews.com\/N<wbr>ews\/News.aspx\/226679<br><br>good for thee white men, not for me<br><br>do you feel angry yet?<br><br>are you ready to rise in protest?<br><br>it is your time brothers<br><br>the fire rises","filename":"fb94af74669149f682912985e80b43c6","ext":".jpg","w":550,"h":550,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493429397000,"time":1493429397,"md5":"gVSbUQ4dQq31dWnjAqArkQ==","fsize":57023,"resto":123273861,"id":"mRsmHD1u","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123277705,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)21:32:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"Looks like they&#039;re funded by siphoning money out of the Oakland teachers union.

That report does not list NCMEC\u2019s donors, because donors have a First Amendment right to remain anonymous, but a more transparent organization would, like my own think tank, at least identify its major donors. NCMEC\u2019s CEO, Ernie Allen, was paid $359,191 plus $411,636 in benefits in 2006 (PDF p. 46) and $409,821 plus $426,540 in benefits in 2007 (PDF p. 19), for a total of $1.6 million in two years (roughly $800,000\/year); I\u2019d be reluctant to suggest that anyone at NCMEC was more interested in money than in ernieallenprotecting children, but if given the choice, we\u2019d all prefer to do well while doing good. So if Allen were smart, he\u2019d realize that a court order subjecting NCMEC to FOIA might be the best of all possible worlds: Requiring real accountability would neutralize calls for nationalizing NCMEC, allowing the organization to continue operating as a non-profit that can pay quite a bit better than the Federal civil service.

In many states that didn&#039;t explicitly criminalize homosexual behavior (the sodomy laws), age-of-consent laws were significantly lower for heterosexual couples than for homosexual couples. For example, in the state of Massachusetts, &quot;Lawrence v. Texas&quot;, the age of consent for heterosexual couples was as low as 13 (with parental approval) but was 18 for homosexual men.<br><br>Consequently, a number of gay rights groups opposed age-of-consent laws at the time of NAMBLA&#039;s founding. A &quot;Gay Rights Platform&quot; http:\/\/www.rslevinson.com\/gaylesiss<wbr>ues\/features\/collect\/onetime\/bl_pla<wbr>tform1972.htm formed and adopted by about 200 gay activists at a convention in Chicago held by the National Coalition of Gay Organizations (NCGO), called for the &quot;repeal of all laws governing the age of sexual consent&quot; at the state level. (The NCGO, which was formed at the Chicago convention, primarily consisted of New York&#039;s Gay Activists Alliance (GAA), which was composed of many small gay activist groups organized mostly on college campuses throughout the U.S.). The GAA opposed age of consent laws and had hosted a forum on the topic in 1976. The Canadian Lesbian and Gay Rights Coalition also supported eliminating the existing age-of-consent laws.","filename":"bane_breaks_batman_comparison_by_mleeg_art-d5b5wo9","ext":".jpg","w":900,"h":636,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":88,"tim":1493434377112,"time":1493434377,"md5":"Skm6F4bOLuQuFKvasSng\/A==","fsize":269272,"resto":123273861,"id":"mRsmHD1u","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123286559,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)22:56:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123286185\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123286185<\/a><br> The case of ILGA illustrates this opposition. In 1993, the International Lesbian and Gay Association, of which NAMBLA had been a member for a decade, achieved United Nations consultative status. NAMBLA&#039;s association with ILGA drew heavy criticism, and many gay organizations called for the ILGA to dissolve ties with NAMBLA. Republican Senator Jesse Helms proposed a bill to withhold $119 million in U.N. contributions until U. S. President Bill Clinton could certify that &quot;no UN agency grants any official status, accreditation, or recognition to any organization which promotes, condones, or seeks the legalization of pedophilia, that is, the sexual abuse of children&quot;. The bill was unanimously approved by Congress and signed into law by Clinton in April 1994.<br><br>ILGA had passed a resolution in 1985 which stated that &quot;young people have the right to sexual and social self-determination and that age of consent laws often operate to oppress and not to protect.&quot; In spite of this apparent agreement with NAMBLA on the age of consent issue just nine years before, ILGA, by a vote of 214-30 expelled NAMBLA and two other groups MARTIJN and Project Truth in early 1994 because they were judged to be &quot;groups whose predominant aim is to support or promote pedophilia.&quot; Although ILGA removed NAMBLA, the U.N. reversed its decision to grant ILGA special consultative status. Repeated attempts by ILGA to reacquire special status with the U.N. have not been successful, but the group does exercise consultative status with the European Commission. <br><br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Jesse<wbr>_Helms#Religious_views<br><br>the murder of his senate partner<br>http:\/\/adst.org\/2014\/10\/kal-007-a-t<wbr>argeted-assassination\/","filename":"bane_by_devil_glonk-d58eyk1","ext":".jpg","w":800,"h":1133,"tn_w":88,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493434614921,"time":1493434614,"md5":"ANOeukKz6e6JuPj7lO2Khg==","fsize":187563,"resto":123273861,"id":"mRsmHD1u","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":123286880,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)23:00:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123286559\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123286559<\/a><br>do you want more \/pol\/?<br><br>here are more names<br><br>Which of these members voted to allow NAMBLA to march under their own banner?

They noted the range of gender relations in African societies and referred to the &quot;unnatural damnation&quot; of male-to-male sex in Congo. Andrew Battell, an English traveller in the 1590s, wrote this of the Imbangala of Angola: &quot;They are beastly in their living, for they have men in women&#039;s apparel, whom they keep among their wives.&quot;<br>Advertisement<br><br>Transvestism occurred in many different places, including Madagascar and Ethiopia. Among the Pangwe people of present-day Cameroon and Gabon, homosexual intercourse was practised between males of all ages. It was believed to be a way to transmit wealth. The Nzima of Ghana had a tradition of adult men marrying each other, usually with an age difference of about 10 years. Similar to the pederasty of ancient Greece, Sudan&#039;s Zande tribe had a tradition of warriors marrying boys and paying a bride price, as they would for girl brides, to their parents. When the boy grew up, he too became a warrior and took a boy-wife.<br><br>In this same tribe lesbianism was practised in polygamous households. In the 18th century the Khoikhoi of South Africa used the word koetsire to describe men considered sexually receptive to other men, and soregus was the word they used for a friendship which involved same-sex masturbation.<br><br>Homosexuality is also recorded among the Siwa of Egypt.

I would just.. dont fight the idea that you might be clinically depressed. i couldn&#039;t say if you are but.. having that kind of strong emotion against oneself can be a lot to deal with, can be something that the only reasonable solution to is getting help. It cost me dearly not accepting that I could be depressed, in a way that&#039;s probably not very common, but still. Since then I&#039;ve thought that if I ever get to talk to a group of youths the one piece of advice I&#039;d give is &quot;if you even suspect something like that might be going on, then just go see someone. if it&#039;s nothing- fine, if it&#039;s something you&#039;ll be real happy you went&quot;.","time":1490303212,"resto":117963423,"id":"nbbRAMis","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":117983684,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)17:08:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"This is a good one.

For instance all the &quot;Hilary shills&quot; I thought was just a meme. Today though I noticed through watching h3h3 make a video about the wsj trying to fuck over youtube lying all of these people were defending the wsj. Just in general, even with the pewdiepie things. Is this actually real? Do companies or politicians do this? I know they pay fake protesters but jesus... How does one win against the media and the left if this is the norm? It makes any opposing side look small.","filename":"1487822482659","ext":".png","w":1200,"h":940,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":195,"tim":1491213418808,"time":1491213418,"md5":"YVtIFSyk\/+qVNnq6iXIQKA==","fsize":320193,"resto":0,"id":"FykfgrRv","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"do-people-really-use-bots-online-to-help-with","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":119312533,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)05:57:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"to persuade other people and\/or make themselves feel right","time":1491213475,"resto":119312481,"id":"GMskVi8\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

When you&#039;re expressing racism you&#039;re saying something hateful about black people or Mexicans, and you are always attacking that generalised idea. That is what a bigot is: a person who is not able to actually interact with individuals in a meaningful, compassionate way, so they just lump everybody under the single category of Mexicans and say they are rapists, which is what Donald Trump did. That&#039;s an easier sentiment to memeify because it&#039;s not making any argument or claim, it&#039;s just a nebulous statement that people can then bring their own bigotries to, so it almost allows for more individual resonance because it&#039;s not saying anything real. <br><br>https:\/\/www.vice.com\/en_uk\/article\/<wbr>dear-white-people-please-stop-prete<wbr>nding-reverse-racism-is-real?utm_so<wbr>urce=vicefbuk&amp;utm_campaign=global<br><br>http:\/\/i-d.vice.com\/en_us\/article\/w<wbr>ho-owns-hoop-earrings?utm_source=vi<wbr>cefbus<br><br>https:\/\/tonic.vice.com\/en_us\/articl<wbr>e\/why-i-left-my-white-therapist?utm<wbr>_source=vicefbus","filename":"ingsoc","ext":".png","w":1000,"h":1000,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493221443454,"time":1493221443,"md5":"LKs5WEdIdTcCmF1tGypnFQ==","fsize":74213,"resto":122890993,"id":"ksbd2uUp","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122897263,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)11:44:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122892143\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122892143<\/a>","filename":"Helicopter","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":741,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":90,"tim":1493221466062,"time":1493221466,"md5":"zrYAV32n3hiEIMXH6SlkZg==","fsize":63825,"resto":122890993,"id":"tzzIbBDQ","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":122897346,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)11:45:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122896970\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122896970<\/a><br>Oh he paid for it himself instead of the usual funding scheme?","time":1493221514,"resto":122890993,"id":"f5qb2vGt","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122897361,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)11:45:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122894049\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122894049<\/a><br>Excellent point, Aquafresh","time":1493221523,"resto":122890993,"id":"mGmKjU+9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122897399,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)11:45:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"This was the only Hillary meme that was funny, and I&#039;m pretty sure that&#039;s because we made it.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Women want to be raped by high value men<\/span>","filename":"B5r4say","ext":".png","w":1476,"h":984,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1493221545424,"time":1493221545,"md5":"q2fhXOstY9fvASq2w2Zhew==","fsize":1128368,"resto":122890993,"id":"BrEr4udw","country":"AU","m_img":1,"country_name":"Australia"},{"no":122897426,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)11:45:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122894049\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122894049<\/a><br>The HIlldawgs were much better than anything that schumpfkins ever made.","time":1493221555,"resto":122890993,"id":"sS0JEiB4","country":"AR","country_name":"Argentina"},{"no":122897574,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)11:47:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122895106\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122895106<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Which is why it&#039;s not working, it&#039;s why it&#039;s just embarrassing.

When you&#039;re expressing racism you&#039;re saying something hateful about black people or Mexicans, and you are always attacking that generalised idea. That is what a bigot is: a person who is not able to actually interact with individuals in a meaningful, compassionate way, so they just lump everybody under the single category of Mexicans and say they are rapists, which is what Donald Trump did. That&#039;s an easier sentiment to memeify because it&#039;s not making any argument or claim, it&#039;s just a nebulous statement that people can then bring their own bigotries to, so it almost allows for more individual resonance because it&#039;s not saying anything real. When liberals or progressives try to combat that, typically they try to combat that abstraction with specifics \u2013 specific stories, specific tragedies \u2013 and those simply do not lend themselves in the same way to memetic engagement. Memes need to be abstract, disconnected from specific experiences so that more people can latch on and do their thing with it. Far-right wing expression is just a little bit easier to memeify. <\/span><br><br>topkek, if you actually read between the lines here, they&#039;re butthurt that their anecdotal stories aren&#039;t taken as serious as overall trends, facts, statistics, etc.","filename":"not_an_argument","ext":".png","w":763,"h":1065,"tn_w":89,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493222829930,"time":1493222829,"md5":"49\/yA\/Wi4R2KrLNs44mKQQ==","fsize":463948,"resto":122890993,"id":"8E0gPHyK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122900078,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)12:07:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122890993\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122890993<\/a><br>Shit memes from the left as per usual. <br>The truth will set you free, and they are afraid of the truth, so their memes fail and their lives reflect their memes.","filename":"gasgasaccident","ext":".gif","w":470,"h":335,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":89,"tim":1493222862481,"time":1493222862,"md5":"MreaQx3+ZOtSmvVXzfJy0g==","fsize":2311434,"resto":122890993,"id":"38X+BFFc","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122900152,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)12:08:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122899564\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122899564<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;CIA actively recruited transgender <\/span><br>holy fuck it&#039;s true, that explains so much","filename":"1490695773956","ext":".png","w":292,"h":257,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":110,"tim":1493222894505,"time":1493222894,"md5":"RLW5j0CCA3a1RHiAOSQs\/Q==","fsize":112278,"resto":122890993,"id":"pVCniUzE","country":"AT","country_name":"Austria"},{"no":122900185,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)12:08:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122899158\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122899158<\/a><br>Their mockery is so weak and pointless.

Their search included laboratory experiments on both animal and human subjects. The program operated under the direction of Charles Savage of the Naval Medical Research Institute, Bethesda, Maryland, from 1947 to 1953.[1][2] The project was geared to identifying agents both synthetic and natural that were effective during interrogation. The project was centered on, but not restricted to, the use of anabasine (an alkaloid), scopolamine and mescaline. The program ended shortly after the Korean War in 1953, presumably due to limited progress and the success of other projects.<\/span><br><br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Proje<wbr>ct_CHATTER","time":1493611654,"resto":123516918,"id":"c7ypj7pc","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123576471,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)00:13:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123575851\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123575851<\/a><br>Someone in a previous thread mentioned Forrestal which got me thinking about drugs.<br>http:\/\/www.wnd.com\/2001\/09\/10682\/<br>&#039;The object of the project was to devise the means to \u201celiminate free will in targeted individuals,\u201d causing them to do anything desired, including assassination and suicide.&#039;<br><br>and this was in the 60s..","time":1493612029,"resto":123516918,"id":"yK\/QsdXk","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123576603,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)00:15:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123538721\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123538721<\/a><br>The left photo is a volcano erupting, not a carrier spewing smoke.<br><br>Try again.","time":1493612124,"resto":123516918,"id":"eBtIHNjE","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123577184,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)00:21:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123576471\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123576471<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Someone in a previous thread mentioned Forrestal<\/span><br>That was probably me, though of course there might be others.<br><br>Forrestal&#039;s murder reminded me of the description of Pinto&#039;s death.","time":1493612484,"resto":123516918,"id":"MP5SQfpy","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123577367,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)00:23:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123577184\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123577184<\/a><br>it is very similar","time":1493612599,"resto":123516918,"id":"yK\/QsdXk","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123577412,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)00:23:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123577184\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123577184<\/a><br>He&#039;s the one who was given LSD by the CIA without his knowledge and then &quot;jumped out of a window&quot;, right?","time":1493612628,"resto":123516918,"id":"c7ypj7pc","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123578008,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)00:29:52","name":"Anonymous","filename":"1381592853648","ext":".png","w":682,"h":477,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":87,"tim":1493612992443,"time":1493612992,"md5":"JgKVu+1cv952ZQYDJ10r3g==","fsize":463021,"resto":123516918,"id":"LapUqwGn","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123578262,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)00:32:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"1953 Central Intelligence Agency report titled &quot;A Study of Assassination,&quot;

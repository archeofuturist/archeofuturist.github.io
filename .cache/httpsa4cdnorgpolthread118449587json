Sure, there have been deportations, but they are mostly people who have criminal backgrounds that have been getting caught for other shit and then just happen to get lit up by immigration as well. <br><br>Aside from that, in my particular town there are pretty well defined lines in regards to our own demographics. There is a working middle class that is mixed pretty evenly between D\/R, but they lean to the democratic side pretty heavily when the President starts talking about building a wall and all that shit. The upper class is, was, and always will be almost 100% republican and the shit tier moocher class will almost always be democrat. There are a lot of government moochers here, but they are generally isolated to their own areas and social groups. Anyone that is &quot;upper class&quot; will be found in certain parts of town and almost never on the south side. I&#039;m not saying that is how it should be, but that is the reality of the town. <br><br>The secret to this all is, the upper class is who controls my entire city from behind the scenes. Political representatives are always pulling for someone, regardless of the party. The city was built by and is still largely controlled by a handful of mega-rich families (whites and white hispanics) who all love Trump but cannot publicly announce it due to the backlash. So when you look at our voting results, don&#039;t let it fool you. When you live here shit is extremely right wing conservative.

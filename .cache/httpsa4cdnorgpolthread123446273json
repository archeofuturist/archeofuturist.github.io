Emilia is a half-elf, and so is the witch, in the same way people link socialism and communism. the MC is the &quot;useful idiot&quot; pushing for political change while ignoring the far more balanced ideologies vying for power because he is emotional rather than logical.","filename":"Emilia_Anime_2 blush","ext":".png","w":1920,"h":1080,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1493533357894,"time":1493533357,"md5":"ZCzquBAWu6lf1TPtruAABg==","fsize":2352163,"resto":0,"id":"\/Ei5jGrC","country":"AU","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"after-watching-some-re-zero-kara-hajimeru-isekai","country_name":"Australia","replies":2,"images":1,"unique_ips":3},{"no":123447121,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)02:33:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123446273\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123446273<\/a><br><br>Emilia is Satella. She says so in the first episode. She summoned MC and put a love spell on him so he would fall in love with her. She also gave him the power (or curse if you will) to repeat the last few days after a death. Since he&#039;s in love with her, it guarantees he will use the power to aid her. Having someone who can time travel on your side guarantees you will win every exchange. Having them love you guarantees they will do whatever it takes to use the power to keep you alive no matter how torturous it is, because that is the power of love.<br><br>In the end it&#039;s likely she will win the tournament to become the ruler, and then reveal herself as Satella. MC will still be fighting for her because of the love spell, despite him knowing she is evil. He&#039;ll likely end up killing most if not all of his friends. Possibly Rem could talk him down in the end because true love could possibly break through the false love he has for Emilia\/Satella.<br><br>Once this happens he will kill Satella. The curse binding him to the world will die out with her, and he will be transported back to his reality, leaving his true love Rem and all his remaining friends behind.<br><br>It&#039;s likely at this point that he will kill himself again, only this time he will be dead for good.<br><br>This is my prediction for how the plot will go.","time":1493533991,"resto":123446273,"id":"zZAOP3Xd","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123449346,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)03:01:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123447121\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123447121<\/a><br>So putting that into \/pol\/ perspective, Emilia is a communist acting as a socialist. her speech about equality is her sweet talking the plebs.<br><br>assuming what you say takes place, then the MC notices the true nature of the new kingdom and revolts.<br><br>so in the end all is good then, since the gommunists fall.","filename":"spurdo 1465380159574","ext":".png","w":415,"h":416,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493535664004,"time":1493535664,"md5":"1CpzK\/+8mz664VIeLp65Bg==","fsize":6331,"resto":123446273,"id":"BrnzgPYi","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"}]}

My family certainly instilled judeo-christian principles, but no supreme being or judgement existed. <br><br>That resulted in a few things that ultimately led me to willingly pursue Christianity.<br><br>1.) Fear of death. Enough said, but this fear was debilitating; hours of wasted time almost having a panic attack.<br><br>2.) No real reason for me to be a &#039;good&#039; person. Once I figured out how to lie to people and get away with it, I started to wonder why I followed all the rest of the rules my parents had spoken about. Eventually I realized it was basically a fear of the police. This led me to a pretty frustrated existence: I wanted to do things, but couldn&#039;t because of made up rules etc. (tl:dr...edgy teen phase.)<br><br>I talked with some Christian friends of mine and have started to go to Church. <br><br>What I have real difficulty with is individuality within Church. I take pride (I suppose the Christian answer might be that my pride is sinful and needs to be snuffed out?) in who am I, and I don&#039;t see how personality lasts in Christianity. All the hardcore Christians seem like the same person.","time":1493269523,"resto":122997502,"id":"8aB86SLN","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123001134,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)01:39:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122997502\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122997502<\/a><br>This election showed me Satan is real.<br><br>Was raised oitside of church. <br><br>I was born again on Nov.7th and Trump was elected Nov.8th.<br><br>135iq tested by commiefornia public school.<br><br>Jesus is coming soon, get ready.","time":1493271569,"resto":122997502,"id":"1vwAxwEh","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

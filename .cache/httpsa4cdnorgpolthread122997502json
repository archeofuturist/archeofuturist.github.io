Somehow (how is never really defined) this is the greatest feeling, and experience ever.

Love for the sake of giving love. I have no problem with that, just don&#039;t think that Christianity has some sort of rigid moral guidelines that every Christian has to stick to lest they burn in Hell forever.

One it&#039;s the right thing to do and for some reason humans know inherit food from bad. Second we are saved by faith and good works. Sometimes it&#039;s penance. Nothing says your sorry like actually getting off your ass and doing something about it. Third you sound like you went to a protestant church full of mindless drones devoid of logic and reason. Think all religious Christians are devoid of individuality? See St. Thomas Aquinas. See Copernicus and the heliocentric theory. See the Father of the Big Bang. See the monks in New Mexico who brew beer. See Bishop Barron on YouTube (great videos to watch btw). Most importantly remember this God gave you a brain. A brain capable of logically and rationally figuring things out.

I am sorry to share it with you, but I really need to get it out of my head in the hope it stops bothering me so much because I don&#039;t want to see certain people in my life in such a bad light and maybe someone here can help. <br><br>As a bit of a background to how I came to these conclusions, you just need to know that I am currently majoring in mathematics and learning about quantum mechanics. As you probably know most forces in the universe can be assigned into two categories. At the most basic level, this becomes the positive and negative which can be restated in many ways, additive and subtractive, light and dark, hot and cold, expansion and contraction or most complexly creative and destructive. <br><br>The spiritual realm primarily focuses on separating creative and destructive forces with the ultimate metaphor annotated in the bible in the form of God and Satan, but Yin and Yang is another common metaphor used. If you look at these things not as necessarily objective reality, but as metaphors for the human condition each of those forces can be used to describe functions of the human condition.<br><br>I began thinking about how one can accurately recognize these forces in the human condition and how can one identify which part of the human condition is creative and which is destructive to strive towards creative rather than destructive endeavors. Is there any kind of mathematical proof that can back this up or is it all just a matter of personal opinion?<br><br>Enter my current study of Quantum Mechanics particularly as it pertains to Atomic and Electromagnetic Forces. As you are probably aware, the positive force of the atom is attributed to the subatomic particle, the proton, while negative force is attributed to the electron. In a simplified way at the quantum level, negative electron motion is associated with electron holes while positive extremes of electron motion are associated with magnetic poles.","filename":"Devil-In-Red-HUGE[1]","ext":".jpg","w":2100,"h":1608,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":191,"tim":1490168328080,"time":1490168328,"md5":"AnqZsVtCkj+\/87cFbGdrzA==","fsize":1930772,"resto":0,"id":"MRTiJngp","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"mathematical-proof-for-the-patriarchy","country_name":"United States","replies":33,"images":4,"unique_ips":13},{"no":117735587,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)03:39:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117735552\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117735552<\/a><br>This lead me to realize that the human condition is also separated into two different complimentary natures, the female and the male form, and that one of these is defined by a hole while the other is defined by a pole. This leads to the natural conclusion that females must be the destructive half, while males are the creative half of the human condition. At first this didn&#039;t make sense given that women &quot;create life&quot; but the longer I thought, the more I realized that it first requires a male to fill their hole and that creation comes at the expense of the destruction of the sperm\/egg and a great deal of destruction of the female form that created it. The more I see this perspective the more I see males as having created most of history and innovation while women have done a lot to hold back progress. <br><br>I also came to the realization that the rise of feminism ironically correlates with the rise of electronics which have acted in many ways as a passive destructive feminizing force upon the human condition. This has stirred a lot of grief because electronics have also created a lot of good and this is where I need your help to shift my perspective and poke holes in this theory as a mathematical proof that women are destructive. I need your help because it certainly won&#039;t come from the bible that associated Eve with Satan and original sin or any other of the great allegorical epics like Greek mythology that credits Pandora as the source of evil or The Odyssey that blame Helen of Troy for all the destruction of war or even Yin and Yang which associate the dark with feminine or any of the major religions that feel the need to subjugate and control women.<br><br>btw I&#039;m a girl or at least a biological female cursed with an analytical man&#039;s mind.","time":1490168361,"resto":117735552,"id":"MRTiJngp","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117735731,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)03:41:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"let&#039;s all laugh at OP","filename":"hv","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":363,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":75,"tim":1490168481330,"time":1490168481,"md5":"DpT6Oe6pcnSF1u7YL91n6Q==","fsize":44352,"resto":117735552,"id":"5YVdnPAl","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117735831,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)03:42:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117735731\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117735731<\/a><br>Is this just something every man already knows?","time":1490168575,"resto":117735552,"id":"MRTiJngp","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117735869,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)03:43:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117735552\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117735552<\/a><br>Taoism + Walden + Kaczynski<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;tits or gtfo<\/span><br><a href=\"#p117735831\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117735831<\/a><br>No, or you wouldn&#039;t be here","filename":"pollogo1","ext":".png","w":938,"h":976,"tn_w":120,"tn_h":124,"tim":1490168617257,"time":1490168617,"md5":"XqML6Te2C2cR7NmsRCMqQw==","fsize":1115551,"resto":117735552,"id":"n1mzkLoG","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117736041,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)03:46:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117735869\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117735869<\/a><br>I feel like most people are still kids when they procreate and haven&#039;t become the men and women who have figured out the bulk of their worldview which is why the divorce rate is so high.","time":1490168780,"resto":117735552,"id":"MRTiJngp","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117736044,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)03:46:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117735587\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117735587<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;one of these is defined by a hole while the other is defined by a pole.<\/span><br><br>kek","time":1490168782,"resto":117735552,"id":"nSsh7vDS","country":"DK","country_name":"Denmark"},{"no":117736226,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)03:49:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117736044\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117736044<\/a><br>Since you brought kek with you, you seem like the best person to ask. <br>Is there any way to shift away from electronics and start developing protonics?","time":1490168961,"resto":117735552,"id":"MRTiJngp","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117736477,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)03:53:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"The masculine and feminine are destructive or creative in different ways.

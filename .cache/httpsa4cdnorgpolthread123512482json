However, some kinds of offenses carry no such implication.<br>Traditionally, the distinction was drawn in terms of offenses involving &quot;moral<br>turpitude.&quot; That concept can be construed to include offenses concerning some<br>matters of personal morality, such as adultery and comparable offenses, that have<br>no specific connection to fitness for the practice of law. Although a lawyer is<br>personally answerable to the entire criminal law, a lawyer should be professionally<br>answerable only for offenses that indicate lack of those characteristics relevant to<br>law practice. Offenses involving violence, dishonesty, breach of trust, or serious<br>interference with the administration of justice are in that category. A pattern of<br>repeated offenses, even ones of minor significance when considered separately, can<br>indicate indifference to legal obligation.","filename":"jew","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":600,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493579645414,"time":1493579645,"md5":"QQeM87\/S6vqk8FqzXtnuLA==","fsize":39105,"resto":0,"id":"gpaazGkq","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"can-pol-get-shanta-driver-disbarred","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

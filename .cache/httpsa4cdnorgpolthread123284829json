Assume Le Penn loses, then what? I personally, don&#039;t find the election all that meaningful to MY life. Of course it sucks that your country is going through some degenerate shit, and if it means a lot, you should research cities or towns in France that align to what you want. Even though the government and portions of your country will be inundated, there will still be cities or towns that contains the charm you&#039;re looking for, if your work allows it. That&#039;s what I would do. As for the future, unless someone actually grows the balls to start killing or putting these people in camps, then no. They are dumber than us, but they reproduce more. In essence, that&#039;s all that matters to replace a population in a couple of lifetimes.<br><br>Since I&#039;m an ecologist, I can make a good reference. They are like invasive plants. It only takes a couple to create a carpet of invasives that begin to take over the natural area and convert it into a monoculture of itself. The land will go through a cycle of degeneration. It&#039;s all about prevention, right now we are not getting any of that. <br><br>Also it&#039;s Centaurea cyanus, it&#039;s currently beginning its bloom here in NY State. Nice little annual flower!

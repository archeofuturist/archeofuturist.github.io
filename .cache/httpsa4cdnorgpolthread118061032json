Almost certainly unconstitutional, yet somehow passed the supreme court under the premise it was a tax, not a fee (despite being paid to private companies that set the price). <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Artificial monopolies<\/span><br>The law mandates that only certain insurers can operate in certain areas. Pretty much crony capitalism that was done to get the insurers to dance along to the obamacare tune.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Removal of denial of service for pre-existing conditions<\/span><br>Prevents insurers from denying people insurance based on a pre-existing condition. <br><br>Trumpcare removes the first two, that benefit the government and the insurers, and keeps the third that benefits consumers. If you are a laissez-faire capitalist and a free market purist then this is still bad. If you&#039;re someone who supports government intervention into the market to help people then it&#039;s certainly better than Obamacare as it helps people without kicking back to the corporations or forcing people to get insurance. <br><br>The upside to this is people won&#039;t die simply from not having insurance before they get ill. The downside is prices will raise to accomodate the costs insurance providers face by being forced to cover those with pre-existing conditions, but since you&#039;re no longer forced to have insurance, you&#039;re not forced to pay the fees, which means insurers can&#039;t just charge whatever they want. <br><br>Ultimately I think it&#039;s worse than a free market solution, but I&#039;m right of center and this is more centrist policy. I ultimately think the reason congress is rolling with it is because they&#039;re concerned with re-election in 2018 and they don&#039;t want the media posting images of dying children denied healthcare under the free market system due to having pre-existing conditions, which may sway voters to vote democrat in 2018 and 2020 by appealing to their emotions, essentially assuring Obamacare would be revived.","filename":"1441402375832","ext":".jpg","w":571,"h":460,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":100,"tim":1490348428776,"time":1490348428,"md5":"TpxqULAnChTvQZvEtZ\/L0A==","fsize":48024,"resto":118061032,"id":"oqxwP4sq","country":"NZ","country_name":"New Zealand"}]}

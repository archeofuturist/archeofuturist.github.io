Why do countries need to increase their population (which also leads to dollar value falling, aka inflation) increasing population means less people in the workforce and many more being supported by welfare and such, so it would make sense to cut population expansion to prevent an economical collapse. I think the optimal for the planet is about 3 billion if not a bit less for manufacturing optimization and whatnot.","filename":"world-population-1820-to-2010","ext":".png","w":754,"h":454,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":150,"tim":1490433413969,"time":1490433413,"md5":"Kn0vg9jDhT9SbfNN2iXdsw==","fsize":34951,"resto":0,"id":"tAMeLMPe","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"why-population-increase","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":118207334,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)05:20:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118207117\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118207117<\/a><br><a href=\"\/biz\/\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;&gt;\/biz\/<\/a> repilled board that may help you","time":1490433620,"resto":118207117,"id":"cP5GLS\/O","country":"RO","country_name":"Romania"}]}

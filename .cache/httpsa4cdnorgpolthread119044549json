Born Gy\u00f6rgy Schwartz 12 August 1930 Soros grew up in Nazi occupied Hungary. His name was changed to George Soros in 1936 as a protective camouflage against antisemitism. At age 13 Soros began his career by reporting other Jewish children to a government official which earned him trust, he aquired official doccuments naming him as a christian in return by means of being named as the official&#039;s god son. He then went on to work with his adopted godfather to confiscate property from the local Jewish population. Soros describes that time as &quot;the happiest time of my life&quot; and when asked if he felt guilt over the events he stated &quot;No, only feelings of absolute power.&quot; In 1947 Soros moved to London and enrolled in the London School of Economics where he studied under Karl Popper, the Austrian-British philosopher who was one of the first proponents of an \u201cOpen Society.\u201d Soros then worked at several merchant banks in London before moving to New York in 1963. In 1970, he founded Soros Fund Management and in 1973 created the Quantum Fund in partnership with investor Jim Rogers. The fund made annual returns of over 30%, cementing Soros\u2019s reputation and putting him in a position of power\u2014one he utilizes to this day to advance the agenda of his mentors.<br><br>In the 1990s, Soros began a string of large bets against national currencies. The first was in 1992, when he sold short the pound sterling and made a $1 billion profit in a single day. His next big currency speculation came in 1997. This time Soros singled out the Thai baht and, with heavy short-selling volume, destroyed the baht\u2019s artificial peg to the US dollar, which started the Asian financial crisis.<br><br>Today, Soros\u2019s net worth stands at $23 billion. Since taking a back seat in his company, Soros Fund Management, in 2000, Soros has been focusing on his philanthropic efforts, which he carries out through the Open Society Foundations he founded in 1993.","filename":"soros-big","ext":".jpg","w":960,"h":540,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1490957155108,"time":1490957155,"md5":"tvTL3xTfm+3PLDVmPgFBKg==","fsize":42222,"resto":119044549,"id":"Eib6PpZv","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":119045054,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)06:47:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"Shit was just a shame, Obama turned out to be an even bigger shithole than Bush because at least in 2008 things were starting to settle down, then Obongo gets involved and all hell breaks loose again","time":1490957233,"resto":119044549,"id":"mHBIhHkQ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119045067,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)06:47:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"During the 1980s and 1990s, Soros used his extraordinary wealth to bankroll and fund revolutions in dozens of European nations, including Czechoslovakia, Croatia, and Yugoslavia.

If you wonder why Soros meddled in these nations\u2019 affairs, part of the answer may lie in the fact that during and after the chaos, he invested heavily in assets in each of the respective countries. He then used Columbia University economist Jeffrey Sachs to advise the fledgling governments to privatize all public assets immediately, thus allowing Soros to sell the assets he had acquired during the turmoil into newly formed open markets. <br><br>In 2004, Soros stated, \u201cI deeply believe in the values of an open society.

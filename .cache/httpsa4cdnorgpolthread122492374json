He&#039;s the Hillary status quo candidate with far worse economic conditions in France compared to the UK or USA. She has far more support and energy behind her campaign, she has the working class, half the police force. It has all the tell tale signs of a Trumpian victory. The unification against the Front National I highly doubt will be anywhere near the numbers of 2002 (or the predictions even). Fillon is far closer politically to Marine, and his voters will likely be stealth marine voters, same goes for melanchon supporters (who detest macron). The stealth Trump vote will be far greater this time around too, because they expectation here is everyone unifies around macron and shits on marine so the social stigma against her will be far greater than what Trump got.","time":1492983944,"resto":122492374,"id":"97ivNvBH","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122494241,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)17:51:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122492374\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122492374<\/a><br><br>He hasn&#039;t won yet, there is another vote in two weeks between him and le pen.<br><br>French System is different","time":1492984283,"resto":122492374,"id":"A0gU2Ux9","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"},{"no":122494448,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)17:52:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122493450\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122493450<\/a><br>Macron is already getting support from the mainstream parties.

But I will do the math. Let&#039;s say his bakery became operational in early 1942 and ended in late 1944. We will call this 550 days for the sake of argument. Each cake takes 2 hours to bake with modern machinery, and for the sake of argument we will say that technology 80 years ago was as good as technology today (which we all know isn&#039;t true, we aren&#039;t children). This would mean that he baked for 3,000,000 hours, which comes out to be about 342 years. Even if he somehow put three cakes into one oven and they still baked at the same rate as one cake, it would still take over 100 years! And I don&#039;t think Opa threw away many cakes, as remnants of cakes in the area number no higher than the thousands. In order to fit that many cakes into this timespan, he would have to bake very quickly! How quickly? If you divide 1.5 million by 18 (rough estimate of 18 months) he would have had to bake about 83,000 cakes a month. In other words, this comes out to about 2,700 cakes a day. There are 24 hours in a day (assuming the ovens were burning 24\/7), which means that he baked 112 cakes per hour, or just over two cakes per minute. <br><br>Did Opa really bake a cake every 30 seconds when even today they take two hours, or was I simply lied to?","filename":"1487661038414","ext":".jpg","w":542,"h":1099,"tn_w":123,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492549273964,"time":1492549273,"md5":"RLbCXWINX+DV960zSAtcGQ==","fsize":276403,"resto":0,"id":"snQELiuC","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"hey-pol-story-time","country_name":"United States","replies":3,"images":1,"unique_ips":3},{"no":121740364,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)17:06:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"It was real in his mind.","time":1492549619,"resto":121739596,"id":"T5tWN7kM","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121740679,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)17:09:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121739596\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121739596<\/a><br>you have to kind of think, you know, that these cakes aren&#039;t full sized cakes, disease and starvation would&#039;ve made rats eat most of their flour, so these cakes would&#039;ve only been like 60-80 lbs. Cooking time would vary, but i can see it happening if you properly preheated your oven.

Rents are capped via subsidies paid for by tax dollars. Those tax dollars are largely collected from the middle class. So, while asset inflation occurs siphoning money from the poor\/middle class to the asset owners, the government steps in to subsidies the poor. They do so using middle class tax dollars. That money goes to the owner of assets. With the lower threshold being subsidized, there is even more inflationary pressure which requires more subsidies. The run-off inflation cycle continues. The rich get even richer. The tax man collects more. The poor\/middle class become a sub-class.<br><br>So, you&#039;re essentially accelerating and feeding the pain.

Heavily studied by conservationists, he was captured on video earlier this year. <br><br>The Department of the Interior has designated 764,207 acres of Arizona and New Mexico as Critical Habitat for jaguars. Under the Endangered Species Act, that designation requires any federal agency to \u201cconduct their activities in such a way as to conserve species,\u201d and also to \u201censure that any activity they fund, authorize, or carry out will not jeopardize the survival of a threatened or endangered species.\u201d<br><br>This map shows the Critical Habitat set aside for the jaguar. Any wall roughly tracking the border would have to pass through it. Detouring north, to avoid the habitat, would invariably leave cities like Sierra Vista and Nogales exposed to the southern border. Skipping that area could ruin the point of the wall entirely by leaving a porous, difficult-to-monitor area. <br><br>With only a single jaguar remaining in the U.S., does the species have any chance of a future? The hope is that a female from the Mexican populations will wander north and find El Jefe or that he may wander south and find a potential mate.

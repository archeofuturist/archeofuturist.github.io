Heavily studied by conservationists, he was captured on video earlier this year. <br><br>The Department of the Interior has designated 764,207 acres of Arizona and New Mexico as Critical Habitat for jaguars.

Any wall roughly tracking the border would have to pass through it. Detouring north, to avoid the habitat, would invariably leave cities like Sierra Vista and Nogales exposed to the southern border. Skipping that area could ruin the point of the wall entirely by leaving a porous, difficult-to-monitor area. <br><br>With only a single jaguar remaining in the U.S., does the species have any chance of a future?

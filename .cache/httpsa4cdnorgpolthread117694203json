I started out initially wondering if SJWs losing all credibility was ultimately good or bad. During the 2016 election, after the deaths of the officers in Dallas, I started wondering whether or not it&#039;s better if Trump wins. I obviously didn&#039;t make the thread then, because I didn&#039;t want to be lumped in with CTR; however, I think the smoke has cleared enough to have a somewhat nuanced discussion on the subject.<br><br>Basically, is it a positive change, long-run, that SJWs hold no cultural power and the Right is on the rise?<br><br>Sure Trump&#039;s good in a number of ways, he&#039;s the best Republican candidate to run since Pat Buchanan. SJWs are awful people with awful ideas, and any power they wield ultimately harms society. These things are objectively true, but look at the response from the general public.<br><br>Most people really don&#039;t care about SJWs outside of the internet. The problem with the new progressives is that they left the incubator of academia early and met the public far before they had proper academic grounding. That resulted in most people ignoring them, and others taking the piss out of them. Most people can honestly say that they&#039;ve never met an SJW, and many of those that have interacted with them in some form or another haven&#039;t really been pushed to the right at all. Instead we get cultural libertarians and the like (Sargon of Akkad, Paul Joseph Watson, etc.) forming a good chunk of the resistance.<br><br>These people have also been huge proponents of the Trump phenomenon. Don&#039;t get me wrong, part of me is enthused that he won; however, I feel like we&#039;re seeing a repeat of the 80s all over again.","filename":"TheGame","ext":".png","w":500,"h":333,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1490142833481,"time":1490142833,"md5":"TJc2w1LLNzAa99MxJkHJcw==","fsize":254539,"resto":0,"id":"Xn4Ra+fn","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"is-anyone-else-sad-to-see-that-sjws-are-a","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":1},{"no":117694232,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)20:34:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117694203\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117694203<\/a><br><br>The Left absolutely destroyed society in the 1960s (Sexual revolution, &quot;Egalitarianism,&quot; Hart-Cellar Immigration Act, Neomarxism, Postmodernism, etc.). All of their corrosive ideas seeped into the culture and eventually ruined us. Along came the 80s and Reagan, and people had some hope. The problem is that Reagan and his disciples never went far enough. They got complacent, and focused on the economy. The economy improved and the Cold War ended, and the right sat on their hands; they didn&#039;t have the sense to go re-litigate those cultural changes.<br><br>It seems like the same thing is happening now.

Or are we just witnessing a pendulum that swings less to the right each cycle?<br><br>tl;dr: Would we be better off ultimately if SJWs actually seized power and pushed people to the Far-Right, rather than just milquetoast classical liberals?<br><br>2\/2","time":1490142849,"resto":117694203,"id":"Xn4Ra+fn","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

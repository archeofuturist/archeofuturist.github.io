Planting negative - and largely false - ideas about the EU in people&#039;s heads is much easier than actually making a rational and logical case about why the UK might be better off outside the EU. <br><br>People like Farage chose to major on this option, the lazy option and it worked like magic. Talking about the EU in terms of how it has apparently stolen our country from us, resonates with a lot of people, who are not clued up enough to know it is largely manipulative nonsense. <br><br>The idea that we need to take back something that belongs to us and has been stolen from us is as powerful and compelling as it is nebulous and ridiculous. When people say they want to take back the country, they are basically buying into a piece of cheap marketing nonsense that connects with many but has little validity in the real world. <br><br>The reality is our country hasn&#039;t been taken away from us and therefore leaving the EU cannot make any difference in that sense, because you can&#039;t return something that hasn&#039;t been taken away. But once you have planted the germ of such an idea in people&#039;s minds, it&#039;s hard to remove it. <br><br>The reality is that in the modern world no country is an island - even an island. We are all interconnected and interdependent and whether we leave the EU or remain inside it, we will still be hugely dependent on the EU and have to maintain significant links with what is the world&#039;s largest market. The fanatical hatred has little basis in reality and if you have such a position I&#039;m afraid you have been used.

The scientific consensus at this point is that Homosapiens originated in Africa. As The population grew certain groups branched out tribes and colonies were formed. As we spread across this vast planet, different colonies of humanity slowly begin to adapt to their environment, with enough time- not only did it affect their physiology but also their genetic make up; creating different races. For the best of humanity eventually societies and civilizations were built. However some of the species did not &quot;explore&quot;, and did not progress out of tribalism.<br><br>Without question The most significant and impactful\/beneficial discoveries and inventions for humanity were made by the Caucasians: Aviation, Automobiles\/ petroleum motors, ship propellers, submarines, antibiotics, x-rays, MRIs, the radio, electromagnetism, rocket fuel, refrigeration etc. Of course in the 1500s the Chinese made significant contributions with gun powder, the compass, paper. As renowned anthropologist carelson s coon discovered: over 6000 years of documented history the pure bred Negroid in its native land has built nothing. Incontrovertibly the most developed, civilized and prosperous countries on this planet are predominantly Caucasian. Again the only thing close to competition would be the best of the Mongoloids the Chinese, the Japanese.<br><br>I can understand it being taboo, but the fact that it has become malevolent is just ridiculous. And it all stems from the frailty of other races, conceptualized from a deep seeded inferiority complex (which is so embarrassingly evident when they &quot;lash out&quot;).","filename":"IMG_1368","ext":".png","w":1237,"h":1017,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":205,"tim":1491715281176,"time":1491715281,"md5":"PiEZkpCuwePhok5pMCtnAg==","fsize":121946,"resto":0,"id":"XCgsT3H4","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"i-dont-understand-how-white-supremacy-became-so","country_name":"Canada","replies":3,"images":1,"unique_ips":3},{"no":120243624,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)01:23:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"What is sickening is the Caucasians that pander to this nonsense, it is literally very patronizing and cavalier.

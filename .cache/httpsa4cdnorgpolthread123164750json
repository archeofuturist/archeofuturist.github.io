People are capable of awful things but we change and learn from our mistakes just like our ancestors did. And by no means does anyone have a right to take credit for what their ancestors may of accomplished either. But there&#039;s nothing wrong with identifying with our community or nationality and having respect for our history. The globalist elites who&#039;ve bought out the media hate that and you can see it every day with their subversion tactics. Another way of trying to accomplish the global cultural marxism is the pushing of open borders, although seem like just social constructs. These constructs are needed to keep prosperous nations and cultural diversity throughout the world. If you destroy that and destroy identity, you get a population easy to control.&quot;","filename":"un","ext":".jpg","w":980,"h":552,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1493364433438,"time":1493364433,"md5":"QeCFb7LR0dElzSlNyugDyA==","fsize":91939,"resto":0,"id":"+DRIy\/lu","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"im-thinking-about-dropping-this-subtle-redpill-on","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":123164871,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)03:29:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"Bump","time":1493364554,"resto":123164750,"id":"iY6Ikw3C","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123164899,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)03:29:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123164750\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123164750<\/a><br><br>You aren&#039;t very smart, mate.

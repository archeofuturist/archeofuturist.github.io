I realized a while back that Trump is merely serving as a safety valve for white political discontent. It&#039;s the only reason (((the powers that be))) allowed him to win.<br><br>The underlying goal of Trump&#039;s presidency is to stop the proverbial &#039;boiling frogs&#039; (us white people) from leaping out of the pot before we meet our demographic demise. They want us to sit back, put our feet up and relax, as if we have won the battle. When in reality, Trump is merely a continuation of the same corrupt establishment that he vowed to dismantle and destroy.<br><br>He&#039;s a narcissistic megalomaniac whose only concern is himself and those close to him. He has zero interest in preserving America&#039;s status as a white-majority nation. We&#039;ve all been gleefully duped by a master con man.

Germany is a very clean, efficient country. I don&#039;t feel any hostility here in Frankfurt, but I mostly just feel disconnected. I would settle down in earnest because the environment is overall agreeable despite the detachment but there is an opportunity for me to move to South Korea instead, so I&#039;ve been working in that direction, because in Asia I actually feel emotionally attached to the place, even if I&#039;m pretty bad at actually being Asian--I can&#039;t even speak Korean right now.

K-Pop is alright musically, actually, but I don&#039;t follow the groups.<br>I made a few friends (acquaintances?) in Korea, I&#039;m still surprised at how easy it turned out to connect with Koreans, as for some reason I spent most of my life thinking that peninsular Koreans weren&#039;t even people and that they would hate me and I should just accept being culturally Russian. I&#039;d probably never consider Korea if I didn&#039;t become a weeaboo as well and spend two years learning Japanese before realising that this is where I wanted to be, in Asia. I envy that you got to grow up in a culture that I wish I had! I don&#039;t see myself moving to Japan though, for some reason they feel thoroughly unfriendly over there. Maybe they notice that my face is Korean?","time":1491844456,"resto":120451741,"id":"H6PD1pVT","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"}]}

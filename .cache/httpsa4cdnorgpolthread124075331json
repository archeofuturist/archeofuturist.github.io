France will have been a belligerent in 49 of them, and the United Kingdom in 43.<br>Of the 185 battles France has fought over the past 800 years, its armies will have won 132 of them, and will have lost 43, leaving only 10 undecided battles. This does not take into account the battles before the year 1200 and there have been many! France thus holds the record of battles, wars and coalitions against it throughout the history of mankind.<br><br>- Over the last 800 years France has beaten over 200 years against England, over 150 years against the Germanic nations, more than 190 years against the Spaniards \/ Portuguese, and facing many other nations.<br><br>Often these wars were waged against France in numerical inferiority against coalitions of several nations aimed at destroying it. The most striking example is that of the Battle of Bouvines (1214). France is fighting alone for its survival against the immense Holy Roman Empire, England and the Flemish countries.<br><br>Vive la France.","filename":"1493509948-img-20170430-015003","ext":".jpg","w":1564,"h":1564,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493914467609,"time":1493914467,"md5":"pBh1\/UtloHDj9qsjGFzItg==","fsize":1843810,"resto":0,"id":"ARc2kYaZ","country":"FR","m_img":1,"bumplimit":1,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"france-the-biggest-nation","country_name":"France","replies":350,"images":84,"unique_ips":129,"tail_size":50},{"no":124075881,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)12:19:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;country of war<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;only 2 million people have legal firearms, the rest are just statist bootlickers<\/span><br><br>get fucked OP","time":1493914789,"resto":124075331,"id":"kGYVl98W","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":124076242,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)12:23:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;country of war<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;surrender as soon as things start going bad<\/span><br>Not any more you aren&#039;t","time":1493915017,"resto":124075331,"id":"dG17cs2S","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124076984,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)12:30:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124075331\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124075331<\/a><br>what a great history, rejoice because your past is full of virtue.

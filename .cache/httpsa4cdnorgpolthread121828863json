I\u2019m not talking about communism. What I\u2019m talking about is far beyond communism...I read \u2018Communist Manifesto\u2019 and \u2018Das Kapital\u2019 a long time ago, and I saw that maybe (((Marx))) didn\u2019t follow Hegel enough. He took his dialectics, but he left out his idealism and his spiritualism. And he went over to a German philosopher by the name of Feuerbach, and took his materialism and made it into a system that he called \u2018dialectical materialism.\u2019 I have to reject that.<br><br>What I\u2019m saying to you this morning is communism forgets that life is individual. Capitalism forgets that life is social. And the kingdom of brotherhood is found neither in the thesis of communism nor the antithesis of capitalism, but in a higher synthesis. It is found in a higher synthesis that combines the truths of both. Now, when I say questioning the whole society, it means ultimately coming to see that the problem of racism, the problem of economic exploitation, and the problem of war are all tied together. These are the triple evils that are interrelated.&quot;<br><br>He may not have been a commie in practice, but he read it and agreed with the distribution parts but was also being fed anti-soviet shit at the same time. He wasn&#039;t full commie, but he was basically the reason we had a push for a welfare system like we do and suggested a lot of its systems before being offed.

All of their kids will have to come to the big cities and be exposed to diversity and tolerance and see how much better it is than hate and bigotry that Trump represents.

I voted for Trump but even I realize that he isn&#039;t a perfect candidate and that we should be allowed to talk about certain cabinet choices\/policies we don&#039;t like without being called &quot;shareblue&quot; or whatever the fuck the_donald&#039;s next buzz word is. I don&#039;t even fucking use Reddit so why in the fuck do faggots on \/pol\/ create so many threads about it? That never used to happen pre-\/pol\/harbor. That shit could have gotten you banned before then.","time":1491981518,"resto":120716999,"id":"3gVGNaVW","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120728264,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)03:20:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120717438\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120717438<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;shill pushing shill narratives<\/span><br>fuck off already, fucking faggots.","filename":"homicide_rates_by_race_and_economics","ext":".png","w":358,"h":316,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":110,"tim":1491981653699,"time":1491981653,"md5":"Oh700y3s13ret7qYmWdPrw==","fsize":43612,"resto":120716999,"id":"7UTkfbZx","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120728414,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)03:23:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120717438\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120717438<\/a><br>fpwp","time":1491981790,"resto":120716999,"id":"mTp+C0vK","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120728618,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)03:25:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120718286\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120718286<\/a><br>s o o n","filename":"1484012722444","ext":".jpg","w":564,"h":451,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":99,"tim":1491981956521,"time":1491981956,"md5":"Xx8amlw3vxeUADH8WLEnkg==","fsize":60014,"resto":120716999,"id":"u7PXepiw","country":"JP","country_name":"Japan"},{"no":120728700,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)03:27:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120728100\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120728100<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;you&#039;re attempting to create a narrative<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;creates a narrative<\/span><br>I&#039;m not trying to create a narrative.

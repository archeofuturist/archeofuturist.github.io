What do you do?","com":"Through some means you become a leaders of some nation (fictional but hear me out).<br><br>You have enough military power to enforce rule of law across your country, but no more than that currently.<br><br>The nation has a decent GDP, but most wealth is hoarded by an elite that provides the third greatest economic resource of your country. The second greatest resource is already heavily regulated by state (previous gov) and the greatest export and economic drive is agriculture split among hundreds of small businesses.<br><br>Unemployment rate is high, there are a lot of homeless in the streets. 15% of the population is considered an &quot;oppressed&quot; minority, which commit 60% of the crime and makes up for half the unemployed (but only 10% of the homeless).<br><br>60% of your citizens are christian, 15% non-religious, 15% Muslim, and 10% who gives a shit. Approx. 1\/3rd of the Muslims want to be able to stone adulterers and murder the gays and do all the other things they do.<br><br>Currently your leadership is supported by only 35% of the populations, 95% of which are non-minority, none are Muslim.<br><br>There is currently tension between mosts Muslims, 2\/3rds of the &quot;oppressed&quot; minority, and everyone who supports you.<br><br>You have two neighbours. One is based as fuck and totally supports you. The other actively hates you and constantly sends immigrants your way (mostly Muslims).<br><br>To recap, you have racial tension, low leadership support, potential terrorist cells, high homelessness, high unemployment, high welfare reliance, large immigration influx, and a potential foreign enemy.<br><br>On the plus, you have a functioning economy (sort of), a well trained and armed military, a powerful ally, large land mass with plenty of natural resources, and unlimited legislative power.<br><br>What do you do \/pol\/?","filename":"jontron","ext":".jpg","w":1094,"h":720,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":164,"tim":1491486814856,"time":1491486814,"md5":"IZn80SteGVN6qN7UnN0mPg==","fsize":71381,"resto":0,"id":"7wsne0I\/","country":"AU","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"you-are-supreme-leader-what-do-you-do","country_name":"Australia","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

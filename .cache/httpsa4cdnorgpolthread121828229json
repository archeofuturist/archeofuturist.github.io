There was never any crisis, just dumb cunts and losers wanting to exterminate their own people.","filename":"1491758130279","ext":".jpg","w":1070,"h":676,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":78,"tim":1492600734529,"time":1492600734,"md5":"HH6cZHNdvOudetmqTnSzJQ==","fsize":118853,"resto":121828229,"id":"YK8zf4vJ","country":"DK","m_img":1,"country_name":"Denmark"},{"no":121832936,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)07:19:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121832570\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121832570<\/a><br>just test their dna you fag, why do you think they are de legitimizing race and gene identity with &quot;their every one is mixed today you cant tell whos who anymore.&quot;","filename":"European Union Jews","ext":".jpg","w":1940,"h":1190,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":76,"tim":1492600779122,"time":1492600779,"md5":"SNaB2ejgi7ysu\/GKk8iPlw==","fsize":341820,"resto":121828229,"id":"TXi3sfZP","country":"NL","m_img":1,"country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":121832955,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)07:19:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121828229\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121828229<\/a><br>Schulz is merkle plant.

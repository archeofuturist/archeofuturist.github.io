Because you need credentialed people to get permission to do things, and the credentials all take lots of time to get, so one person can&#039;t get a lot of them, even if he can learn to do all of the things.","time":1491632151,"resto":120079542,"id":"2y9RWLTV","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120097540,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)02:16:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120084758\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120084758<\/a><br>HEY EVERYBODY HOP ON BOARD, LETS RUIN THE FUTURE CAUSE LIVE IN THE MOMENT","filename":"229916_c92a110010ace6b2ff9eb6fd0613d123_large","ext":".jpg","w":550,"h":364,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":82,"tim":1491632162611,"time":1491632162,"md5":"1amKG+kME+Ott61CImOZCw==","fsize":50398,"resto":120079542,"id":"xze11WU0","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120097569,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)02:16:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120096030\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120096030<\/a><br>im not australian m8<br><br>and what does me having slow internet have to do with you not seeing this until it got reposted on faceberg?","time":1491632180,"resto":120079542,"id":"e17xO4ux","country":"NZ","country_name":"New Zealand"},{"no":120097796,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)02:18:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"Boomers are the source of many of our societies&#039; problems.

Because you need credentialed people to get permission to do things, and the credentials all take lots of time to get, so one person can&#039;t get a lot of them, even if he can learn to do all of the things.","time":1491632151,"resto":120079542,"id":"2y9RWLTV","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120097540,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)02:16:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120084758\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120084758<\/a><br>HEY EVERYBODY HOP ON BOARD, LETS RUIN THE FUTURE CAUSE LIVE IN THE MOMENT","filename":"229916_c92a110010ace6b2ff9eb6fd0613d123_large","ext":".jpg","w":550,"h":364,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":82,"tim":1491632162611,"time":1491632162,"md5":"1amKG+kME+Ott61CImOZCw==","fsize":50398,"resto":120079542,"id":"xze11WU0","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120097569,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)02:16:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120096030\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120096030<\/a><br>im not australian m8<br><br>and what does me having slow internet have to do with you not seeing this until it got reposted on faceberg?","time":1491632180,"resto":120079542,"id":"e17xO4ux","country":"NZ","country_name":"New Zealand"},{"no":120097796,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)02:18:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"Boomers are the source of many of our societies&#039; problems.

I have swallowed a couple of red pills and I do, only so far now, support Trump. <br><br>I&#039;ll be honest, I&#039;m failing college. Why? I&#039;m lazy and procrastinate way too much. I&#039;m dropping out because it is too much money. Why did I go? I got a 3.7 GPA in my public high school, and they told me I was ready for college, literally. In order to graduate you needed to do some tests in order to be considered college ready or career ready or both by the school. I was both. I go to UofL and it sucks. I was not ready for college. I blame public schools. It was easy, could do the hw in class, tests were easy because of that, and I flew right by it. Obviously college is nothing like that. You clearly have hw all the damn time, and with all this technology, gym, board games, and other shit around me I always lay off the hw. I&#039;m lazy, no denying that. Most millennials are. They give college too much credit as if they have to go there, a necessity. <br>Either way, public education is a huge issue. If the government controls the public schools, and (((they))) control the government, then there is something fishy going on with our system. Furthermore, I have not met one person who is succeeding in college that has yet to cheat on either their homework or test. That tells me that we are praising college the only way. Fuck that. If you truly are hard-working and can do homework freely, or if you&#039;re rich\/full ride to college then I do suggest college. It&#039;s right for you. But if you are a typical millennial who complains about how they have &quot;anxiety&quot; or is just flat out lazy then I would never recommend it. Not even to my child, if I plan on having any (still a virgin). The real reason you&#039;re in debt is because you were tricked into thinking you were ready for this Cerberus beast. Lastly, if you want prices of colleges to go down, quick giving them your money.

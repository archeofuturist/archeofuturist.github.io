They don&#039;t get to be taxed when living and working abroad because they already contribute there and use foreign infrastructure. There is litteraly no justification to tax the income of expat workers. Tax evasion is another beast entirely, and cannot be toppled while inside the EU (you&#039;d have to repeal or change the Lisbon treaty, which needs the unanimity of members to be done. Luxembourg, begium, the netherlands, ireland... will NEVER vote for allowing a tax on the movement of capital because their economies thrive through tax evasion from productive countries).

That&#039;s nice of you to know chocolatine but there&#039;s way more to it, and I can tell you that chocolatine and poche are maybe the only things people with immigration background know about our region.

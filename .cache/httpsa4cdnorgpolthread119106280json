So far there have been some folks making everything blue, some others creating pixelart, etc. <br>Now, me and some other fellas, in an attempt to make plebbit great again, have decided to make everything grey. It&#039;d be really great if ya&#039;ll here could provide some assistance. <br>Also our crew so far is called NoColoreds and we&#039;ve teamed up with OperationWhiteIsRight. So yeah, anti-colored.","filename":"grey","ext":".jpg","w":758,"h":438,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":144,"tim":1490997957296,"time":1490997957,"md5":"fEFwK17gFvPlFFec\/CK\/lw==","fsize":36856,"resto":0,"id":"KBsjx1sZ","country":"GR","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"plebbit-paint-thing","country_name":"Greece","replies":6,"images":0,"unique_ips":6},{"no":119106400,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)18:07:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"I think people underestimate how influential the_donald really is.

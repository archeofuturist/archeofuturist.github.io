Being a pushy fat cow does not make you &quot;empowered.&quot; It makes you a pushy fat cow. Blame &quot;the patriarchy&quot; all you want, but it&#039;s your own fault that the only physical love you can find is with other pushy fat cows who couldn&#039;t land a meaningful relationship with a man. But, let&#039;s blame the men! Because it certainly is not YOUR FAULT for being a foul-mouthed, dumpy, emotional fuckwit COW. But do keep having temper tantrums in the streets demanding to kill the babies you will never have. It just makes SOOOO much sense.","time":1490980274,"resto":119074016,"id":"0gzUVSHj","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

Like how much does right-wing depend on paid shills, trolls, ect. On YouTube as well, I see a loads of small channels with basically no audience still manage to pull very high production values seemingly out of nowhere. It all just feels very...fake. The forced memes, the constant propaganda, everything.<br><br>I have no doubt that the majority of people here are genuine, but be honest, how much money do think is involved in right-wing political trolling on the broader scale.

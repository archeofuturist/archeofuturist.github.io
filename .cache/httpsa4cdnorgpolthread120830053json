He showed how the names of the main chapters of the Book of Genesis were all Basque in origin and had their appropriate, specific meaning. For his theories, the abbot has been called \u201cone of the strangest characters of the \u201ctheological era\u201d. In 1825, the French abbot Diharce De Bidassouet wrote in his &quot;History of the Cantabrians&quot; that Basque was the original language spoken by God, a statement for which the abbot was soundly ridiculed. At about the same period, the Basque priest Erroa stated that Basque was the language spoken in the Garden of Eden. His colleagues thought he was a lunatic, but Erroa was so deeply convinced of being right in his hypothesis that he caught the attention of the Bishop of Pamplona: he, conversely, directed his appeals to the Chapter of the Cathedral of Pamplona. The ecclesiastical institution considered Erroa\u2019s theories and, after many months of deliberations, established that Erroa was right and publicly supported his theory. However, in a short time all the reports and the registry containing the ecclesiastical deliberations disappeared mysteriously.","time":1492042435,"resto":120830053,"id":"4Qx5AJG3","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120836210,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)20:18:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120835672\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120835672<\/a><br>thanks bby &lt;3","time":1492042680,"resto":120830053,"id":"f7z60mzc","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120836814,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)20:22:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120830293\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120830293<\/a><br>Are you retarded?

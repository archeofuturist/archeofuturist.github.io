About the unsavory details of Obama&#039;s heavy smoking.<br><br>He came back from French Polynesia with a two pack-a-day habit. Just had a contractor come to install high powered fart-fans in his new Kalorama house, and the source says: it&#039;s probably more like 3 packs a day as he basically chain-smokes lighting one off the other. <br><br>&quot;When he&#039;s home, he spends most of his days up in that 2nd floor smoking room\/office chain-smoking and talking on the phone.&quot;<br><br>He also has a habit of not using ash-trays, if they aren&#039;t in reach he will balance the end of a lit cig butt on a table with the coal pointed up. They frequently fall over leaving small burns that pepper all of the areas where he smokes. Carpet burns everywhere.<br><br>I believe all of it. And it sounds like mental health issues. PTSD or some heavy duty anxiety shit. <br><br>What a weakling. I can&#039;t believe this sadsack p.o.s. got elected. <br><br>Trump isn&#039;t weak like that.","filename":"obammok","ext":".jpg","w":659,"h":432,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":163,"tim":1492921700785,"time":1492921700,"md5":"oYpFBaJcFWzSOP4Vlhg6BQ==","fsize":74963,"resto":0,"id":"lc8Q2adY","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"obama-heavy-smoker-update","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

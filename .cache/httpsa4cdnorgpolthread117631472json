Dominance, assertiveness, coldness are all grouped together; and submission, obedience, and warmth are all grouped together, for example. It doesn&#039;t matter what you label these things \u2013 the human brain operates in these two fundamental modes, and it colours the way we function in the world and the way structure our societies. This distinction enters into everything we do and makes itself known as much as possible. This is why you have girl colours and boy colours. There&#039;s nothing inherently masculine or feminine about the colours themselves, but the brain will come to arbitrarily think of one as feminine and one as masculine because it has to because that&#039;s the way it works. It&#039;s inescapable. We even look at cables you plug into computers in masculine\/feminine terms. It doesn&#039;t matter if you&#039;re a westerner or in one of those weird tribes where women take on the role of men \u2013 the brain distinguishes between masculine and feminine and assigns the corresponding values to men or women. I think dick people are better suited to what is perceived as masculine because of our biological make-up, and that vagina people are better suited to feminine because of their biological make-up. I disagree with changing genders because it represents an erosion of culture and tradition we&#039;ve stuck to for hundreds of years which has historically served us very well.","time":1490109775,"resto":117631472,"id":"FA2tBZfa","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":117633766,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)11:24:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"its that simple","filename":"1464822516837","ext":".jpg","w":731,"h":341,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":58,"tim":1490109845532,"time":1490109845,"md5":"TnwK1YKFBDAToaQQIWj9YA==","fsize":42063,"resto":117631472,"id":"Lr1sJdL+","country":"CL","country_name":"Chile"},{"no":117633998,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)11:26:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117633766\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117633766<\/a><br>\u300bfar left","time":1490110008,"resto":117631472,"id":"eIy4iqRI","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":117634942,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)11:33:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117631779\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117631779<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;durr <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;sterility<\/span><br>you don&#039;t understand how evolution works at all<br><br>why is pol so fucking full of retards who don&#039;t understand basic sex and biology?<br><br>both genders and sex are a social construct.

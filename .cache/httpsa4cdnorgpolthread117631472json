It doesn&#039;t matter what you label these things \u2013 the human brain operates in these two fundamental modes, and it colours the way we function in the world and the way structure our societies. This distinction enters into everything we do and makes itself known as much as possible. This is why you have girl colours and boy colours. There&#039;s nothing inherently masculine or feminine about the colours themselves, but the brain will come to arbitrarily think of one as feminine and one as masculine because it has to because that&#039;s the way it works. It&#039;s inescapable. We even look at cables you plug into computers in masculine\/feminine terms. It doesn&#039;t matter if you&#039;re a westerner or in one of those weird tribes where women take on the role of men \u2013 the brain distinguishes between masculine and feminine and assigns the corresponding values to men or women. I think dick people are better suited to what is perceived as masculine because of our biological make-up, and that vagina people are better suited to feminine because of their biological make-up.

In my opinion, I wouldn&#039;t even call it the effective since, transgenders still know that they are not really the gender they desire to be which creates this deluded mentally bringing it harder on them when people realize they are transgendered. The mental illness and the deluded behavior is the cause of their high suicide rates.

Variation over time, mutations, and natural selection, all make the facts rock solid when it comes to the question of whether or not sex and gender are binary. they aren&#039;t because if they were, evolution would never work. Whether or not you want to argue to the extent of what a transgenderd person&#039;s feelings matches or doesnt match what you might expect a female mind to, or any other minute point, doesn&#039;t touch the core arguement of the right is that transgender and granular sex and gender identity is wrong because it&#039;s unnatural and often results in sterility or non reproduction of the person afflicted, which in terms of reflecting the reality of life and biology is demonstrably false. If you want a paper on it, I suggest you go real all of the ones on mutation, evolution, natural selection, and biological niches. because this stuff is provably correct and anyone that uses the arguements mentioned to discredit gender dysphoria or homosexuality or push gender and sex being binary are demonstrably wrong.","filename":"1488946177351","ext":".jpg","w":425,"h":340,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":100,"tim":1490116555869,"time":1490116555,"md5":"LOOSC+Oxg8\/Hpb6zYQsJfQ==","fsize":70744,"resto":117631472,"id":"KxBGqCWi","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117645382,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)13:16:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"Gender is another word for sex.

New commercial satellite imagery from April 2 indicates continued activity in this area and at the Main Administrative Area, while the rest of the facility remains quiet. This pattern of activity could mean a sixth nuclear test is imminent, but the imagery does not provide any definitive evidence of the installation of a nuclear device or the exact timing of such a test.","filename":"Fig1_Punggye-Upd-17-0406-1024x768","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":768,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1491630649137,"time":1491630649,"md5":"jJyI4VPT\/4cFQg1KuDFkiA==","fsize":455511,"resto":120094415,"id":"mCDvbMSQ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120095391,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)01:54:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"To be honest, I was surprised that there was not a test shot during the Trump\/Xi summit. But I think one will happen as soon as it can be arranged, just to spit in the eye of the US.

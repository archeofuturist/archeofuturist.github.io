Be honest - you have. Did you consider their IQ at the time they were fucking you over? If a black man pulled your sorry carcass from a burning wreck, would you still be a white nationalist? I&#039;m rating that a solid &quot;no.&quot; So what are you a white nationalist for? History? Circlejerking about Evropa and an idealized history that was only good for a few people and miserable for just about everyone else?<br><br>&quot;B-but progress, anon.&quot; What does that even mean? Yes, we also learned how to wield fire. There was no white culture. There was no philosophy. It just happened, and here we are.<br><br>&quot;B-but race and IQ.&quot; So what? How great are you - personally? Do you really think your genetics are better than 90% of the rest of the world? If they were - you wouldn&#039;t be a fucking autist on 4chan. White nationalism is a meme, a scam - just like Deepak Chopra, selling feelgood nonsense to gullible people who get no validation for who they are so they want validation for what they can&#039;t control - being white. A man wearing a MAGA hat could take you for everything you own, and you wouldn&#039;t have seen it coming. Unless you were an actual race realist - like Martin Luther King Jr.","filename":"cat window","ext":".gif","w":500,"h":558,"tn_w":224,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490315885842,"time":1490315885,"md5":"GxFfNv9Y2eEYwGKoGT+aKA==","fsize":1536428,"resto":0,"id":"\/b\/mANCa","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"come-home-anon","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":118012974,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)20:40:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118012618\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118012618<\/a><br>Racism is for idiots who need to put people into categories so they feel safe.

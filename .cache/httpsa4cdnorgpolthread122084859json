By breaking the law<br>2. By being so incompetent they couldn&#039;t keep the fact they broke the law a secret<br>3. By shredding the constitution and laws of their own nation to attack the people revealing they broke the law<br><br>Anyone working for these agencies is a sack of shit. Protecting the people of America my fucking ass. More like covering your own ass and your bosses ass while doing the exact opposite of what you swore an oath to do. Every man in these agencies might as well be labeled an Oathbreaker, a liar, a criminal, a pedophile and pedophile enabler. The intelligence agencies disgust me and if everyone in them died tomorrow I wouldn&#039;t shed a tear; I&#039;d celebrate. One of the worst blights on humanity would be gone.<br><br>The people in them are loyal to The Agency, they are not loyal to The People. When something goes against The Agency&#039;s best interests, no matter how good it might be for The People, these fucks will be working to protect and defend The Agency and not The People. <br><br>Traitors; the whole fucking lot of them. The only ones doing anything good for us are the people leaking the illegal activities and crimes.<br><br>Here&#039;s a protip for Intel Agencies: STOP BREAKING THE FUCKING LAW YOU ASSHOLES<br><br>NO, YOU DO NOT RUN THE COUNTRY; THE COUNTRY AND THE PEOPLE RUN YOU.","time":1492743999,"resto":122084859,"id":"SuW5ET8X","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122086942,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)23:07:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122084859\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122084859<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;wikileaks<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;gmail<\/span><br>Hahahahahaha","time":1492744039,"resto":122084859,"id":"uqq\/++nm","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122086967,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)23:07:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"He&#039;s been dead for 6 months","time":1492744054,"resto":122084859,"id":"SUU0re0n","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122087174,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)23:09:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122084859\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122084859<\/a><br>Good.

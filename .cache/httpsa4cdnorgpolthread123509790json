I say essentially free because even though technically they have to pay interest, they are guaranteed to profit way more than the interest rate they are charged just because of the nature of banking.<br><br>Look up the private member banks of the federal reserve. They are the real ones who make a profit that they can spend on yachts and private islands. The federal reserve itself is just an accounting detail which hands its profits over to the treasury.

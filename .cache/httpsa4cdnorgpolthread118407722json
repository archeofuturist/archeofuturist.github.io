Reporting the launch, The Observer called SCL a UK political communications consultancy firm, which it said was re-launching as a psyops operator.[3] What legal personality the company had prior to the 2005 relaunch - if any - is not clear. Companies House lists no former companies under that name although there were several companies affiliated to the founder Nigel Oakes during the 1990s so perhaps it existed in name only, whilst legally taking the form of a network of offshore entities. It must have existed in some sense because several newspapers in 2000 reported that the company had worked for the Indonesian government. Australia\u2019s The Age reported at the time that SCL had operated in Indonesia since the final days of the Suharto regime,[4] which confirms the company\u2019s existence at least as far back as 1998.

It doesn\u2019t get much more effective than that.\u201d<br><br>Patterson said that his relationship with Mercer has always been collegial. In 1993, Patterson, at that time a Renaissance executive, recruited Mercer from I.B.M., and they worked together for the next eight years. But Patterson doesn\u2019t share Mercer\u2019s libertarian views, or what he regards as his susceptibility to conspiracy theories about Bill and Hillary Clinton. During Bill Clinton\u2019s Presidency, Patterson recalled, Mercer insisted at a staff luncheon that Clinton had participated in a secret drug-running scheme with the C.I.A. The plot supposedly operated out of an airport in Mena, Arkansas. \u201cBob told me he believed that the Clintons were involved in murders connected to it,\u201d Patterson said.

We at the Spectator called them Clinton Crazies.\u201d<br><br>Patterson also recalled Mercer arguing that, during the Gulf War, the U.S. should simply have taken Iraq\u2019s oil, \u201csince it was there.\u201d Trump, too, has said that the U.S. should have \u201ckept the oil.\u201d Expropriating another country\u2019s natural resources is a violation of international law. Another onetime senior employee at Renaissance recalls hearing Mercer downplay the dangers posed by nuclear war. Mercer, speaking of the atomic bombs that the U.S. dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, argued that, outside of the immediate blast zones, the radiation actually made Japanese citizens healthier. The National Academy of Sciences has found no evidence to support this notion. Nevertheless, according to the onetime employee, Mercer, who is a proponent of nuclear power, \u201cwas very excited about the idea, and felt that it meant nuclear accidents weren\u2019t such a big deal.\u201d","time":1490567256,"resto":118407722,"id":"0JGDaBIY","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":118427621,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)18:29:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118407722\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118407722<\/a><br>How many blacks are in this thread?","time":1490567398,"resto":118407722,"id":"dxLTK8FX","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118428057,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)18:32:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"http:\/\/www.newyorker.com\/magazine\/2<wbr>017\/03\/27\/the-reclusive-hedge-fund-<wbr>tycoon-behind-the-trump-presidency<br><br>In 2014, Mercer accepted a lifetime-achievement award from the Association for Computational Linguistics. In a speech at the ceremony, Mercer, who grew up in New Mexico, said that he had a \u201cjaundiced view\u201d of government. While in college, he had worked on a military base in Albuquerque, and he had showed his superiors how to run certain computer programs a hundred times faster; instead of saving time and money, the bureaucrats ran a hundred times more equations.

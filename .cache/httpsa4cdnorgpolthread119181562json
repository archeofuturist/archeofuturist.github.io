Woodward &amp; Bernstein claimed that one of Kissinger&#039;s political foes, Alexander Haig, had told someone unnamed, that he (Haig) had heard Kissinger say it. That&#039;s triple hearsay, made even weaker by the fact that one of the parties is anonymous. Kissinger has denied ever saying it, and it was never substantiated by Haig, nor by anyone of known identity who claimed to have heard it. As Kirkus Reviews noted about the whole book, &quot;none of it is substantiated in any assessable way.&quot;<br>In fact, the quote is not even very plausible, on its face. Kissinger served with distinction in the U.S. Army during WWII, and was awarded the Bronze Star. He has always been very respectful of other servicemen and their sacrifices. For him to have said such a thing would have been wildly out of character. In fact, the awkward phrasing doesn&#039;t even sound like Kissinger, whose English prose is consistently measured and careful, despite his heavy accent, even when he speaks extemporaneously.","time":1491123972,"resto":119181562,"id":"wARfqdqZ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119182543,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)05:13:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119182196\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119182196<\/a><br>You can deny anything so long as no one looks into it.<br><br>His character has been one of saying what people want to hear, so I would not count on him being respectful of other servicemen as anything other than face-saving. <br><br>And the quotes aren&#039;t even the meme of my argument.

But we do know a small number will.<br><br>Lets also consider for a moment that logic and simple mathematics conclude more attacks will likely happen. <br><br>Doesn&#039;t that basically mean, that our governments have simply accepted the fact that some innocent civilians are going to be killed by refugees\/migrants, and still decide to allow them entry despite this?<br><br>I mean we want to help refugees and innocent people, but there IS a trade off. As we have seen in france, USA, etc... A small percentage of these people WILL kill innocent civilians.<br><br>Aren&#039;t people who are opposing the travel ban basically saying, &quot;Okay we have seen the numbers. We realize that a small percentage of our OWN citizens will be killed by these migrants\/refugees. A few hundred people. (France 200 in the last 2 years?). But that&#039;s okay.. It&#039;s worth it.

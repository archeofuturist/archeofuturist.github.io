Pentecostalism is showing some promise though, what with it rising in Latin America, India, China, and Africa, and it being far more conservative and passionate than the relatively laid back and liberal Catholic bloc. I could see some new Christian nations forming and getting genuinely angry enough about the anti-Christian genocide in the middle east to decide enough is enough and start their own crusade.","filename":"horse","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":853,"tn_w":87,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492733573464,"time":1492733573,"md5":"aTWGakaZjlY4le6DuRUFGA==","fsize":63640,"resto":122065318,"id":"iUT4D2UE","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122068114,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)20:16:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122065318\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122065318<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;How do we make Christianity radical again?<\/span><br><br>How do we make Christianity again?","time":1492733776,"resto":122065318,"id":"nfOxrXqF","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":122068456,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)20:19:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"We should study the Scripture more often.

Catholicism and Orthodoxy are fairly similar, yet the divide between them is far too strong for the schism to ever be mended.

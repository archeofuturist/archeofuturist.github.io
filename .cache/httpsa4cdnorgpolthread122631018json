To contest that an argument is unsound because its words aren&#039;t explicitly defined, and because words have an infinite number of possible definitions (between what number of definitions is irrelevant), is a continuum fallacy. All words already have a finite number of implicit definitions. The principle of charity dictates that, when a word in an argument isn&#039;t explicitly defined, you simply choose whichever pre-existent, implicit definition (which exist for all words) would make the argument sound. This is obvious with arguments with &#039;little&#039; words, and it doesn&#039;t change for arguments with &#039;big&#039; words - &#039;big&#039; words don&#039;t objectively exist. There isn&#039;t a certain number of syllables that magically dictates that a word need be explicitly defined.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;All intangible things are immaterial<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Consciousness is intangible<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Therefore consciousness is immaterial<\/span><br>is no different from<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;All dogs are animals<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Huskies are dogs<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Therefore huskies are animals<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;b-but consciousness needs to be defined!<\/span><br>Why &quot;consciousness&quot; and not &quot;husky&quot;?<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;b-because &quot;husky&quot; is already defined!<\/span><br>So is &quot;consciousness.&quot;<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;n-no it&#039;s not! philosophers are still trying to figure out what &quot;consciousness&quot; even is!<\/span><br>They might still be trying to figure out what &quot;husky&quot; is too. That&#039;s irrelevant. If you don&#039;t know what &quot;consciousness&quot; means, you&#039;re expected to google it, exactly like how you&#039;re be expected to google &quot;husky&quot; if you don&#039;t know what it means. There&#039;s no magical property that the word &quot;consciousness&quot; has or lacks that &quot;husky&quot; doesn&#039;t. Any perceived difference is only due to ignorance of - or refusal to acknowledge - pre-existent, implicit definitions. It&#039;s nothing more than a red herring and a deflection tactic.","filename":"1468387589713[1]","ext":".jpg","w":2048,"h":1024,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493064732522,"time":1493064732,"md5":"Y\/t065suWcSb0oOw3GHzGw==","fsize":1653780,"resto":0,"id":"mbK+GUsm","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"words-never-need-to-be-defined-in-order-for-an","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

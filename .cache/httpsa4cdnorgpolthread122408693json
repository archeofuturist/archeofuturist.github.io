d&#039;exploser.<br>Le candidat favori a l&#039;\u00e9lection n&#039;\u00e9tait PAS Macron au d\u00e9but mais Valls , Valls s&#039;est effectivement fait mettre des b\u00e2tons dans les roues , ce qui lui a valu de PERDRE les primaires socialistes contre un candidat bien plus faibles et bien moins populaires (Hamon) , Macron a bien su jouer son jeux et passer comme plus faible que Valls avant de devenir populaire. <br>A ce moment la , le PS et Hollande ne pouvait plus RIEN faire contre Macron , leur partie \u00e9tait en miettes , leur support (donc les \u00e9lus) s&#039;\u00e9miettait petit a petit (encore plus a cause du raprochement entre Hamon et M\u00e9lenchon) , ce qui a laiss\u00e9 champ libre a Macron pour faire campagne sans etre emb\u00eat\u00e9.<br>Si les \u00e9lus (d\u00e9put\u00e9s , s\u00e9nateurs , etc...) avait suivi le PS , il aurait coul\u00e9 et laiss\u00e9 LePen s&#039;emparer du pouvoir totale (majorit\u00e9 a l&#039;assembl\u00e9 au prochaine \u00e9lections , etc...) , ce qui fait que la d\u00e9cision la plus logique \u00e9tait d&#039;abandonner le navire qui coule et de rejoindre leur futur (et oui , les \u00e9lus aussi veulent du travail et \u00eatre peinards).<br><br>Question 2 :<br>Macron est populaire parce qu&#039;il fait jeune , a de nouvelles bonnes id\u00e9es logiques (en tous case au yeux des gens qui ont un travail ou qui sont leur propres patrons) , certes , le fait qu&#039;il soit jeune et pr\u00e9sente bien attire beaucoup de gens (m\u00eame chose d&#039;ailleurs pour beaucoup de gens qui vote M\u00e9lenchon , puisqu&#039;il est bon orateur) , mais je pense que ses id\u00e9es sont les meilleurs de toutes la campagne (en tout cas , mieux que pour les autres candidats).<br><br>Question 3 :<br>J&#039;ai peur

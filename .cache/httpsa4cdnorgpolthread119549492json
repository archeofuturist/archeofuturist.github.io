The term is used in the context of the percentage of women\/minorities in certain fields to frame the situation as unfair, in the same way that many deem it unfair for a large political group to be disproportionately misrepresented in politics.<br><br>By using the word or not correcting others using the word in this way, you are wittingly or unwittingly allowing the situation to be framed in a way that is favorable to people who want gender\/racial quotas or other anti-meritocratic policies. Do not give them that advantage.","filename":"\u5973\u6027\u30b7\u30ea\u30b3\u30f3\u30d0\u30ea\u30fc","ext":".jpg","w":960,"h":684,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":178,"tim":1491357118956,"time":1491357118,"md5":"GDrp\/+ivnkSOEwkEUSVjIQ==","fsize":148106,"resto":0,"id":"wO5CdVAi","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"women-are-not-underrepresented","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":119549810,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)21:54:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119549492\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119549492<\/a><br>yes they are","time":1491357272,"resto":119549492,"id":"yIAm2cPd","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]}

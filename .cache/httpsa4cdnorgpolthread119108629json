When left to speculation and given an appropriate level of knowledge on evolution, genetics, history, human migration patters etc, any rational and unbiased person will come to this conclusion. Not only were our ancestors, who had much bigger things to worry about than being &quot;politically correct,&quot; realized at the glance of an eye, but today most of the science coming out is strongly suggesting that genetics are the major determinant when it comes to intelligence. Unfortunately, many people in the West have been brainwashed to believe this kind of thinking is somehow evil. It isn&#039;t, if anything, concretely proving these things will at least allow us to build political systems on the basis of reality instead of some impossible egalitarian ideal. A lot of people on \/pol\/ might disagree with me, but I don&#039;t regard black people as &quot;necessary&quot; inferior. Inferior intellectually, sure, and obviously intelligence matters in Western society. If anything it is the single most valuable thing you could have here. More so its the foundation of any sort of technological society. What it comes down to is the simple fact that we are all a product of nature, Europeans are superior in a Western capacity, Africans superior in an African capacity. We are not equal, we are different, but all created in the perfect image of what nature intended. That being said, Africans would of course be better off left to their own devices then to be forever left in the lower classes of European\/Western countries.","time":1491007200,"resto":119108629,"id":"bysP+9GO","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119121969,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)20:40:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119108629\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119108629<\/a><br>GREAT JOB","filename":"IMG_1027","ext":".png","w":750,"h":1334,"tn_w":70,"tn_h":124,"tim":1491007209414,"time":1491007209,"md5":"j\/DZaF+CjGfk\/TyB\/zottw==","fsize":495129,"resto":119108629,"id":"vAawNMiH","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119122048,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)20:41:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119121376\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119121376<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;gg<\/span>","time":1491007265,"resto":119108629,"id":"doN8oNrY","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119122166,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)20:42:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119121969\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119121969<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Completed 1907<\/span><br><br>LOL","time":1491007328,"resto":119108629,"id":"be4F2PDE","country":"IT","country_name":"Italy"},{"no":119122311,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)20:43:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119121736\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119121736<\/a><br>Mate the trade route runs straight through Turkey.

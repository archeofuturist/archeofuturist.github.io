Kim would get absolutely OBLITERATED in a war with the U.S., and in a war with South Korea. He is fully aware of how shit his country is. He is just trying to get aid to his country. Trump&#039;s a retard, but he&#039;s not stupid enough to nuke NK. However, trump just dropped MOAB in Afghanistan. Don&#039;t you get it? Kim is bought out. Look at this cheeky fuck. You don&#039;t think Kim is aware that it&#039;s a all a gig? Pic related he&#039;s trying not to fucking burst out laughing. Koreans think his dad like invented the cheese burger. You don&#039;t think Kim is aware that it&#039;s bullshit? He just eats dank food and smashes prostitutes all day, meanwhile Trump is preparing plans to invade Syria and Iran. North Korea is a show. What&#039;s going on backstage? #StopIsrael","filename":"kim-jong-un_650_050914125448_101414084524","ext":".jpg","w":650,"h":474,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":182,"tim":1492228491694,"time":1492228491,"md5":"g7bOY34zSJeKqmg2RB+rkA==","fsize":53052,"resto":0,"id":"cS8+jMoV","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"holy-shit-dont-you-mongs-get-it-there-will-never","country_name":"United States","replies":7,"images":2,"unique_ips":8},{"no":121165857,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)23:57:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121165603\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121165603<\/a><br>Uh, keep telling yourselves that.

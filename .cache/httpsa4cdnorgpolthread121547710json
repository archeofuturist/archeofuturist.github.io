It is generally in the form of simultaneous attacks on a broad front with concentrations of artillery and, particularly, tanks in the break-through area. The attack seeks to penetrate the enemy defenses in two or more sectors and converge on a limited objective; its mission is to encircle or envelop enemy groupings and destroy them by simultaneous attacks from all directions.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The objectives of decentralized defense are to deny the enemy use of terrain, to divide his attacking forces, and to destroy him by numerous local counterattacks on the initiative of the local ground commander<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The centralized type of defense seeks, by employing obstacles or by maneuver, to channelize the enemy attack in a given direction in order to gain a more favorable position for a decisive counterattack with heavily armored units and concentrations of massed artillery. Dummy positions and false fortifications used extensively. A favorite Soviet maneuver is to allow the enemy to penetrate deeply into the lines and trap him in a fire sack.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;According to Soviet doctrine, speed of maneuver, seizure of favorable terrain, and quick deployment of main forces and artillery upon contact are essential. Aggressive reconnaissance, ground and air, is continual throughout the operation. Usually, a strong advance guard is utilized. An attack upon the flank is sought. The fullest use of artillery at the earliest possible moment is made.<\/span><br>Kill yourselves you fucking retards","time":1492448670,"resto":121547710,"id":"gzsAKWVh","country":"LT","country_name":"Lithuania"},{"no":121549497,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)13:06:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121548322\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121548322<\/a><br>Yeah, loosing 3 soldiers for every killed Axis soldier shows definetly a high level of technology","time":1492448804,"resto":121547710,"id":"EjUkfjv2","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":121549511,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)13:06:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121549236\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121549236<\/a><br>Sounds like a zerg rush to me.","time":1492448813,"resto":121547710,"id":"YU2ipI+5","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121549529,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)13:06:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121548865\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121548865<\/a><br>stora, atena the list goes on.

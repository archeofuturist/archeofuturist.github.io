BACON! use your fingers to peel out the meat bits and tear them into strips into a frying pan with NO oil, and in the center of the pan, whack down a slice of bread. Now the lettuce, just regular lettuce- not that Cos lettuce shit they sell to hipsters for twice the price- and rip out enough to fill 3 quarters of your food bowl. TOMATOES! whatever is cheap, cherry, roma, whatever, rip them up and whack them in. Now you flip the slice of bread and the bacon.<br><br>THE SAUCE! in another bowl pour in some oil, and with some regular old white vinegar, twist off the cap and fill the tap and dunk it in. DIJON MUSTARD! just scoop out two fingers worth and use the same fingers to stir the oil and vinegar together until acceptably consistent (8 seconds)<br>Scoop out bacon and toast. Tear the toast into squares and dump the bacon and toast squares into the food bowl with the lettuce and tomatoes. Pour in the sauce! .Then you fish out a couple anchovy fillets from a jar and tear them up and throw them in. Don&#039;t like anchovies? Too bad, stay a fat fuck. I don&#039;t care.

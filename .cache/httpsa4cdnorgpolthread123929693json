How can you be struck on the right cheek? You can be struck on the right cheek only by an overhand blow with the left hand, or with a backhand blow from the right hand. <br><br>But in that world, people did not use the left hand to strike people. It was reserved for &quot;unseemly&quot; uses. Thus, being struck on the right cheek meant that one had been backhanded with the right hand. Given the social customs of the day, a backhand blow was the way a superior hit an inferior, whereas one fought social equals with fists.<br><br>This means the saying presupposes a setting in which a superior is beating a peasant. What should the peasant do? &quot;Turn the other cheek.&quot; What would be the effect? The only way the superior could continue the beating would be with an overhand blow with the fist and acknowledge you as an equal.<br><br>For the superior, it would at the very least have been disconcerting: he could continue the beating only by treating the peasant as a social peer.<br><br>So the peasant was in effect saying, &quot;I am your equal. I refuse to be humiliated anymore.&quot; That is not all. The sayings about &quot;going the second mile&quot; makes a similar point - it will suggest creative non-violent ways of protesting oppression.<br><br>Roman law permitted soldiers to force civilians to carry their gear for one mile, but because of abuses stringently prohibited more than one mile.<br><br>If they ask you to do that, Jesus says, go ahead; but then carry their gear a second mile. Put them in a disconcerting situation: either they risk getting in trouble, or they will have to wrestle their gear back from you.<br><br>So Jesus was showing how to resist.","filename":"iu[1]","ext":".jpg","w":736,"h":385,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":65,"tim":1493833357522,"time":1493833357,"md5":"NKVPpP9rhW0FkeCPqZ95PA==","fsize":60187,"resto":123929693,"id":"547Jz5AC","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123937733,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)13:44:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123935993\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123935993<\/a><br>What do you think about Zionism?","time":1493833447,"resto":123929693,"id":"ga3\/OoSc","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":123937884,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)13:45:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123930245\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123930245<\/a><br><a href=\"#p123929693\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123929693<\/a><br>Early Arnold was extremely, extremely red pilled<br><br>Total Recall<br>Predator<br>Terminator 1&amp;2<br>The Running Man also based as fuck","time":1493833540,"resto":123929693,"id":"MC1oxxHC","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123937987,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)13:46:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123937564\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123937564<\/a><br><br>That still sounds like Gandhi or MLK style civil disobedience to me.","time":1493833595,"resto":123929693,"id":"24YEyD6Q","country":"HU","country_name":"Hungary"},{"no":123938149,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)13:48:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123937034\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123937034<\/a><br><br>Red Heat isn&#039;t even close to Arnolds or director Walter Hills best films.","time":1493833685,"resto":123929693,"id":"JXyxCpeK","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":123938325,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)13:49:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"You guys are dumb as fuck.<br><br>The riddle of steel is not something you can just answer.

Moscow\/St.Petersburg have nice amenities, but cost of living is ridiculous in comparison to pay rates. Russian tenements are ugly on the outside, but reasonably nice on the inside. Outside the cities you&#039;ll find row after row of single family homes in various states of disrepair. Lot of shit roads. <br><br>When I went, which was right before the sanctions hit, economy was looking better. Moscow had a lot of luxury car dealerships, and a fair number of those on the road. There were decent electronic stores around selling TV&#039;s and all the goods we get here for maybe 10% cheaper. Went to an iMAX theater, and one of those 3D theater rides. <br><br>If you see a hot chick in Moscow, she&#039;s probably a sex worker of some sort. Not all women in Russia are hot - and this is particularly true of Moscow. More qts in St. Petersburg and Ryazan from what I can recall.<br><br>On their equivalent of Facebook, VK, you&#039;ll find out that yes - Russians basically are white niggers. Completely obsessed with sex. Even women post naked women constantly. Lots of gun pics. And fast cars. That said, their young people are generally serious - not rampaging drunks like the last generation, fit and healthy, and seemingly hard workers. Lots of patriotism. They blow our Gen Y out of the water in most respects, I find. <br><br>Russian music is awful. May be just me since I hate accordions. Their taste in it in general is also strange. They like American music - but mostly B tracks of forgotten bands.<br><br>Yes, some Russians have bears as pets. But, it&#039;s kind of like some Americans having tigers. They have a lot of cats.

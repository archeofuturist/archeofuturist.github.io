I was pretty happy, graduating with my girlfriend of 3 years (an atheist.) We were talking about getting engaged and moving to start a new life together. But I didn&#039;t feel satisfied. I was almost depress or anxious or something. I also didn&#039;t like who I was becoming - not that I was &quot;bad&quot;, but I was becoming shallow, colder, selfish. I wanted faith again, but I didn&#039;t know where to get it, or if I even could. I started sneaking to different churches behind my girlfriend&#039;s back. Started investigating Christianity more, including all the different denominations and their theologies. I went to Mass with an old high school friend who was Catholic. The beauty of the Mass floored me and I started investigating the Church more. I remember being terrified at first, because I was brought up Baptist and had heard that Catholicism was the &quot;whore of Babylon&quot; and pagan and other things. But the more I read, and prayed, and studied, the more drawn in I felt.<br><br>Anyway, long story short, at around age 24 I finally pulled the trigger and got baptized into the Church. I lost the girlfriend, and even a lot of friends. Finding Christ, in a way, kind of &quot;ruined my life.&quot; But I never felt that way. It wasn&#039;t always sunshine and puppies and it still isn&#039;t. But to me it is worth it. I don&#039;t know if my life would have meaning without Jesus.<br><br>Sorry for the blog post. I just really appreciated your comment.","filename":"tolkieneuch","ext":".jpg","w":736,"h":490,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1491630377863,"time":1491630377,"md5":"v8RfEz0\/KAY5wL9zuJShmQ==","fsize":57309,"resto":120090807,"id":"1pRZFdfg","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120094542,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)01:46:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120092917\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120092917<\/a><br>my god thinks my jokes are funny","time":1491630416,"resto":120090807,"id":"JD90xCUL","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120094562,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)01:47:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120090807\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120090807<\/a><br><br>What&#039;s even more scary is if life keeps going.<br><br>Just think your end comes with the heat death of the universe.

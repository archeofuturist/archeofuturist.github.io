You kill them. You just kill them. As a society. You all decide that cartel members are no longer people. They no longer have rights. They no longer deserve to live. And you just kill all of them. Everywhere you find them. Don&#039;t even worry about making a few mistakes along the way. One human life is worth 10 or 100 or even 1000 cartel lives. Kill them all. Kill everyone who takes their money. Repossess their property once they&#039;re dead. Ise it to kill more cartel members. Kill their kids, wives, parents, grandparents and pets. Use every means at your disposal to kill them. Poison the water, bomb their cars, gas the air. Whatever you have to do until they&#039;re all dead. Make everyone take part in the killing. Offer rewards to people who kill the most. Hold festivals to celebrate killing cartel members. If you really want this to end then your only option is to kill them. You can&#039;t bw half hearted or pussy footed about it. You kill them. Kill them all. And you keep killing until they&#039;re all dead. Don&#039;t stop when they run away or lay down their arms. You just keep killing them. Don&#039;t call it done when they close operations. You just keep killing them. Don&#039;t give up when they go into hiding. You find them and kill them all. No prisons. No judges. Only killing. That&#039;s the only thing that will stop them.","filename":"libertarian","ext":".png","w":1982,"h":1133,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":71,"tim":1492536018638,"time":1492536018,"md5":"Zuk2QkJeRdk0QlJMRW3A4A==","fsize":81879,"resto":121700613,"id":"1xbpYq\/6","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121710093,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)13:20:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121709546\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121709546<\/a><br>CIA send people to teach narcos how to make drugs there&#039;s proof go back to the r\/duckingdolanddick","time":1492536039,"resto":121700613,"id":"LXN3OZE0","country":"MX","country_name":"Mexico"},{"no":121710095,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)13:20:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121709431\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121709431<\/a><br>It&#039;s not about prohibition, is about conscience, when a family of spics are playing that shit even in private they should be riddle with lead, they are shit and they&#039;ll never amount shit just based on their music preference. <br><br>Anyone composing, selling, singing and playing that satanic music should be executed for treason, that music simply promotes the destruction of your nation, that&#039;s treason","time":1492536039,"resto":121700613,"id":"43J89MsT","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121710146,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)13:21:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121708301\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121708301<\/a><br>You have a very warped understanding of the world, in that case.

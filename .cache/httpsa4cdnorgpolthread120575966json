No, the issue of ISIS fighters being able to return to Sweden had nothing to do with this case per-se, and any legislation pertaining to this phenomenon would not have prevented the attack. The attack could however have been prevented if Sweden would actually enforce its own laws! The man had already been sentenced for deportation, and a speedily executed ex-post process would have sufficed. The problem is precisely with regard to people are illegal and are now in hiding. They number close to 15.000 according to some estimates. The priority ought to be to track these people down and deport them. <br><br>The issue of returning ISIS fighters is another matter entirely and its problems are mainly those of legality. You cannot simply revoke somebody&#039;s citizenship under the rule of law, and giving the government this power sets a dangerous precedent. The issue if of course far less complicated when the person in question has a visa of some sort or has been granted permanent residency. The issue ought to be raising the status of citizenship. Making it much more privileged and harder to attain in the first place. We are luckily begging to shift to such thinking now, but it will not solve the problems created in the past by liberal policies. Sweden could do two things to combat returning ISIS fighters with citizenship. Firstly they could recognize the islamic state and declare it an enemy actor and with that make fighting for ISIS akin to treason. Secondly, one could combine this policy with actively deploying the security services overseas and tasking them to make sure that these people stay and don&#039;t come back once they leave, i.e. track them and make sure they are legitimate targets when campaigns are being carried out against ISIS.","filename":"MV5BMjIxMTUyMDIxMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTgxNTU1MzE@._V1_","ext":".jpg","w":708,"h":708,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491913088392,"time":1491913088,"md5":"YETNU+XH4DEtZi3Rh1suBQ==","fsize":63550,"resto":120575966,"id":"xR5giCzT","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":120591225,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)08:23:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120588044\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120588044<\/a><br>really makes me think, 10\/10 quality post wow","time":1491913412,"resto":120575966,"id":"ZxrvW8jd","country":"BE","country_name":"Belgium"},{"no":120592599,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)08:37:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120577284\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120577284<\/a><br>Do you want to catch a disease?

Secondly, one could combine this policy with actively deploying the security services overseas and tasking them to make sure that these people stay and don&#039;t come back once they leave, i.e. track them and make sure they are legitimate targets when international campaigns are being carried out against ISIS. Couple that with reforms around citizenship - making it much more privileged and harder to attain in the first place, would be a good start.

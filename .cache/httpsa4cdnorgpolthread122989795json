Some of the most sumptuous meals created with an artist&#039;s perfection. Well, it turns out, everytime you see cooking, that&#039;s just Mads having a grand ole time. He showed up to the show&#039;s food stylist&#039;s studio, basically just said, &#039;I&#039;ll do this job for you, just teach me&#039; and learned to become an artistic master of culinary preparation and presentation in about a week. Perhaps the best example is the ole egg trick. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;There&#039;s this Benihana egg trick that the writers tried to put it in once before and we got around it because it could be a mess. The idea is you throw an egg up in the air, you put your spatula out and it breaks on the spatula and you twist the spatula just slightly and the egg falls down on the griddle. They do this at Benihana, you know the Japanese chefs with their little tricks, and I&#039;ve seen them screw it up.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;So I called my Japanese food guy and asked for a Benihana chef to bring in for a potential hand double. The next morning, there were two Japanese guys, me, six dozen eggs, and Mads wanders on to the set and asks &#039;Ok, What are we doing?&#039; ... I tell him we&#039;re doing the Benihana egg trick today, but don&#039;t worry because we have these chefs from the Sushi shop, and we&#039;re gonna handle it. So Mads asks what he has to do, and I tell him - you throw the egg up in the air, you stick the spatula out, it breaks slightly, you twist your wrist, then the egg falls down into the pan. He says, OK, let me try it....he goes on set, and he actually did it, first try. I accused him of practicing, but that&#039;s when he told me he used to be a juggler.<\/span>","time":1493270620,"resto":122989795,"id":"3oNWFk3f","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122999840,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)01:24:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122998648\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122998648<\/a><br><a href=\"#p122999368\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122999368<\/a><br>says the faggots who do nothing but post on uzbek hawk training board","time":1493270677,"resto":122989795,"id":"sb\/kQX9r","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122999903,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)01:25:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122996307\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122996307<\/a><br><br>lol faggot internet larper","filename":"32658095","ext":".jpg","w":700,"h":566,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":101,"tim":1493270717946,"time":1493270717,"md5":"qvgr9uBRnQgDoci+hL4LgA==","fsize":80404,"resto":122989795,"id":"ztHAgjNO","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122999950,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)01:25:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122999768\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122999768<\/a><br>Man, fuck you for reminding me about Hannibal food porn.

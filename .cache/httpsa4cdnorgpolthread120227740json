Also, yeah, North Korea doesn&#039;t have ICBMs like we do, and their nukes are very basic, they are pure fission devices like what we dropped on Japan. They don&#039;t have hydrogen bombs (thermonuclear, ie. fission with deuterium\/tritium fusion to provide more neutrons for a much bigger yield and a heavy tamper (usually U-238) to reflect them back into the reaction). That, plus the fact that NK can only get a missile to Japan (maybe) makes them a non-threat to the US. Never mind that the second they hit SK with a nuke we will turn them into a pile of slightly radioactive burning rubble. NK isn&#039;t a threat, and honestly, I think we&#039;ll probably see them fall in our lifetimes. There has been considerable infighting recently, plus China no longer really supports NK.

I had ac interesting discussion on \/pol\/ about this last night as my grandfather was one of the chief military officers responsible for bringing the neutron bomb from Samuel Cohen&#039;s theory to an actual bomb. Basically, neutron bombs have a similar design to hydrogen bombs, but with slight alterations and no tamper (nothing to reflect neutrons back into the reaction, thus lowering yield and increasing radiation output). Theoretically, a neutron bomb would be fantastic for releasing an efficient EMP and killing local soldiers while not knocking down the buildings in a city (except for very local ones as you do still have a nuclear blast). Because we would rather kill infrastructure\/vehicles\/oil\/weapons<wbr> and enemy soldiers who happen to be there, neutron bombs aren&#039;t super helpful (and have never been used officially).

This individual reports to the combatant commander for the area the war is going on (for Korea it would be the commander of PACOM) who then reports to the Secretary of Defense. If we were involved in a war with a lot of other countries as allies like WWII, then we would have a five star officer with an even larger command.","time":1491719108,"resto":120227740,"id":"mF3ybBOR","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120249903,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)02:27:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120249582\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120249582<\/a><br>Minnesota here.

I think that people who hold opinions on issues they don&#039;t understand is degenerate, therefore because of your opinion on drugs you are degenerate. <br><br>Unlike you I have actually studied drugs extensively and have a very well informed opinion on them. Not to mention that almost all drugs are safer than alcohol even though they are illegal, which makes them more dangerous than they would be if they were legal (like how much more dangerous alcohol was when it was legal). Honestly, there are only a handful of drugs which are more dangerous than alcohol in and of themselves, but legalizing them is the only way to reduce deaths from them.","time":1491719454,"resto":120227740,"id":"mF3ybBOR","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120250291,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)02:32:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;mfw I always support the decisions of every President of the United States (including the black one)<\/span>","filename":"1294107218250","ext":".png","w":257,"h":362,"tn_w":88,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491719555096,"time":1491719555,"md5":"q4ph7jYyB5U3L36ewzwGAA==","fsize":41684,"resto":120227740,"id":"2KvHfA8q","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120250343,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)02:33:09","com":"<a href=\"#p120227740\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120227740<\/a><br>Dude, North Korea has been threatening the rest of the world, like DAILY for the past 50 or so years.<br><br>ffs.","time":1491719589,"resto":120227740,"id":"GXjcs9vw","country":"US","trip":"!niqjediPCA","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120250469,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)02:34:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"Honestly fuck this gay earth I really hate living and I fucking hate niggers and kikes.<br><br>May the fires of the atom cleanse this earth.","time":1491719678,"resto":120227740,"id":"ZD6xgiiP","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120250545,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)02:35:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120250469\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120250469<\/a><br>This pls","time":1491719733,"resto":120227740,"id":"tOjM8R+C","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120250605,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)02:36:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"FL real comfy","filename":"1478670062488","ext":".jpg","w":222,"h":227,"tn_w":122,"tn_h":124,"tim":1491719770179,"time":1491719770,"md5":"5yBAhMLdkrRkxy3+TkGPmQ==","fsize":17599,"resto":120227740,"id":"MZPlhcd9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120250645,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)02:36:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120250026\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120250026<\/a><br>I don&#039;t really see anything happening in the midwest even in the worst case scenarios.

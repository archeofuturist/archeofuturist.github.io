If it is still growing they will take steps to ban it, because it&#039;s easy to infiltrate and false flag disputes within such a movement and \/ or it&#039;s followers. <br><br>Beside that as I tried to explain early on the new generation maybe the first one to speak up against the unjust but it&#039;s also in the midst of becoming a minority. And just like in your country the youth lacks male idols and role models that aren&#039;t actors or singers, but real historical figures. This is especially true for elementary schools and kindergardens. I could google random ones and they&#039;ll be completely dominated by females only. Why do I say this? Because the oriental invaders have different standards of what is manly and therefore they are the more dominant individual that is more likely to resort to violence and riots than their german counterpart.","time":1493888137,"resto":124025327,"id":"U1xe1gJa","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":124041040,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)05:06:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124040312\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124040312<\/a><br><br>Of course, but that is not a reason to not go on with this.

Even when foreigners living here adapt to our view like the pole described, it isn&#039;t the Germany anybody desires to live in. We seem to not be able to reverse and go back to a monocultural society. A civil unrest just adds more to the misery of the deminishing white population and bear no fruits for real innovation or a greater goal. It will just be a mass of people with vastly different backgrounds realizing they&#039;re suddenly on the losing end of things while others will exploit this opportunity to be on the benefiting end of it. <br><br>Shikata ga nai.","time":1493889627,"resto":124025327,"id":"U1xe1gJa","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"}]}

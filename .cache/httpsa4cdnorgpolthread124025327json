Then there is also the network of propaganda which every generation has to grow up in set up by the state (school education \/ history pc lessons) and the media which basically boils down to the &quot;evil&quot; period of which everyone should feel ashamed of so history never repeats itself. <br><br>It leads to people just being very ignorant about doing basic research on the topic, because it doesn&#039;t affect them they just have their personal struggles and lack an understanding why todays problems even exist. The academic institutions are inflitrated by leftist ideologies and virtue signalling, simply because the more wealthy germans don&#039;t have to deal with poor peoples reality like living among those immigrant scum that virtue signaling brought us.<br><br>Nobody really seems ashamed of the past, and people take it as an insult being called &quot;jewish&quot; but again, the current generation of people simply never lived through a period were multikulti wasn&#039;t already dominating their daily lives. The boomer generation falls into the category of people that also has no dealings in todays lower class living coditions (in Germany most people rent property rather than having their own).<br><br>Last but not least: Most people don&#039;t have a good understanding of Hitler at all. The leftis demonize him, the center just takes the blue pill, the far right is just a mob of people that just likes to hate foreigners but yet again they fail to see that skinhead culture isn&#039;t national socialism.

The problem roots in the nature of our welfare state(s) in modern european 1st world countries.

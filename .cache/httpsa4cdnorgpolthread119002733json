The survey found that 20% of millennials identify as openly LGBT, while only 7% of the baby boomer generation (ages 52\u201371) would openly label themselves as such. Acceptance of the LGBT community was also found to be at an all-time high.<br><br>&quot;America is the most accepting that it has ever been. Having 20% of millennials identify as LGBTQ is pretty groundbreaking,&quot; Sarah Kate Ellis, GLAAD&#039;s president and CEO, told BuzzFeed News. &quot;What I want to see is that they continue to flourish and blossom as their true and authentic selves.&quot;<br><br>The survey also found that 12% of millennials identify outside the gender binary, as either transgender or gender-nonconforming.<br><br>But although more young people openly identify as LGBT, the study found that non-LGBT millennials are less likely to know someone who identifies as simply \u201cgay\u201d or \u201clesbian.&quot;<br><br>The study found that an overwhelming 63% of young people identify as allies to the queer community. While that age group was the most likely to be accepting, the majority (53%) of Generation X and the majority (51%) of baby boomers were also likely to consider themselves allies.","filename":"lgbt","ext":".png","w":1600,"h":630,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":98,"tim":1490925232393,"time":1490925232,"md5":"+LHoRw5mnUtuC1FQLB1LBA==","fsize":73492,"resto":0,"id":"1syY9gHD","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"adults-1834-twice-as-likely-as-previous","country_name":"United States","replies":33,"images":9,"unique_ips":21},{"no":119002843,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)21:54:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119002733\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119002733<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;18-34<\/span><br>I bet they picked that age range because if they had gone younger the number would have make the social conditioning too obvious.","time":1490925286,"resto":119002733,"id":"ak\/otdV2","country":"AR","country_name":"Argentina"},{"no":119003010,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)21:56:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119002733\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119002733<\/a><br>It&#039;s almost like being gay isn&#039;t e rudely nature, and they stuff they&#039;re pushing is affecting people","time":1490925377,"resto":119002733,"id":"yAKGtaTg","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119003082,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)21:57:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"4chan turned me into a faggot. it&#039;s all about exposure.","time":1490925421,"resto":119002733,"id":"7joISBfo","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119003244,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)21:58:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119003082\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119003082<\/a><br>Have some strength faggot","filename":"IMG_2723","ext":".jpg","w":236,"h":280,"tn_w":105,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490925508821,"time":1490925508,"md5":"IOTheONk7prUm8wvgn9row==","fsize":25330,"resto":119002733,"id":"yAKGtaTg","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119003291,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)21:58:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119002733\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119002733<\/a><br>20% of the population is an evolutionary mistake.

Therefore there is nothing in this half of the galaxy. The galactic hub could easily be masking transmissions from the other side of the galaxy, but that isn&#039;t likely either. Nothing from any galaxies nearby that have had evolutions similar to ours show any signs of transmissions.<br> We would have to be receiving rogue, random transmissions for as long as it takes us to achieve interstellar flight, at least, before we would see any highly evolved life coming to contact us.

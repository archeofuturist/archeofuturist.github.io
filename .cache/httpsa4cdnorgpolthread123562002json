Lutheran teaching is laid out most extensively in the Book of Concord in a series of confessional statements. Other denominations issued their own confessional statements such as the canons of Dort (Reformed\/Calvinist) or the 39 Articles (Anglicanism). <br><br>For Luther the fundamental pillar of the church is that man is saved by grace through faith, or in other words there is nothing that you can do to earn salvation but instead it entirely depends upon God&#039;s mercy toward you. <br><br>Also, why isn&#039;t the knowledge that this book exists more widespread?<br>One of the reasons is that not everything Luther wrote is considered doctrinally binding.

On the Jews and their Lies wasn&#039;t in the Book of Concord and like much of Luther&#039;s writings probably wasn&#039;t considered.

Catholic doctrine of the time held that lending money for interest was a sin, and forbidden to Christians. Not being subject to this restriction, Jews dominated this business. The Torah and later sections of the Hebrew Bible criticise usury but interpretations of the Biblical prohibition vary (the only time Jesus used violence was against money changers taking a toll to enter temple). Since few other occupations were open to them, Jews were motivated to take up money lending. This was said to show Jews were insolent, greedy, usurers, and subsequently led to many negative stereotypes and propaganda. Natural tensions between creditors (typically Jews) and debtors (typically Christians) were added to social, political, religious, and economic strains.

For all authority flows and is propagated from the authority of parents. For where a father is unable alone to educate his [rebellious and irritable] child, he employs a schoolmaster to instruct him; if he be too weak, he enlists the aid of his friends and neighbors; if he departs this life, he delegates and confers his authority and government upon others who are appointed for the purpose. 142] Likewise, he must have domestics, man-servants and maid-servants, under himself for the management of the household, so that all whom we call masters are in the place of parents and must derive their power and authority to govern from them. Hence also they are all called fathers in the Scriptures, as those who in their government perform the functions of a father, and should have a paternal heart toward their subordinates. As also from antiquity the Romans and other nations called the masters and mistresses of the household patres- et matres- familiae, that is, housefathers and housemothers. So also they called their national rulers and overlords patres patriae, that is, fathers of the entire country, for a great shame to us who would be Christians that we do not likewise call them so, or, at least, do not esteem and honor them as such.<\/span>","time":1493606162,"resto":123562002,"id":"5aFd++ct","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123565865,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)22:36:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123565724\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123565724<\/a><br>lol","filename":"quote-i-feel-much-freer-now-that-i-am-certain-the-pope-is-the-antichrist-martin-luther-115934","ext":".jpg","w":850,"h":400,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":58,"tim":1493606164004,"time":1493606164,"md5":"62iIJ3tpwYdqxRXaBkGhYw==","fsize":41135,"resto":123562002,"id":"E51KqiDA","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123565883,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)22:36:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"Went to a private Lutheran school when i was younger (WELS)<br><br>Literally a fucking cult.<br><br>We did bible study until around 1pm and then spent the next 2 hours on math, reading, &quot;science&quot; and history<br><br>Shit was hilarious <br><br>I got suspended cause i beat the shit out of this black kid <br>Was kicked out of the church later that year cause my mom worked odd hours and couldnt make it to church every week","time":1493606178,"resto":123562002,"id":"Gd5DG5kE","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123565886,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)22:36:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123564250\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123564250<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Tradition is greatly respected by Lutherans<\/span><br><br>top lel.

The second repealed all the standing laws which kept Jews from the normal pursuits of the kingdom. Under these new statutes Jews could even lease land for a period of fifteen years and work it. Edward advanced this as a test of the Jew\u2019s sincerity when he claimed that all he wanted was an opportunity to work like other people. If they proved their fitness to live like other people, the inference was that Edward would let them buy land outright and admit them to the higher privileges of citizenship. Did the Jews take advantage of Edward\u2019s decree? This way. To get around the laws against usury they invented such new methods of skinning the peasants and the nobles that the outcry against them became greater than ever, and Edward had to expel them to avert a civil war.

It was twelve years old, and from its eyes and the fact that it had all of its senses, one could have thought that it was a real child. It did nothing but eat; in fact, it ate enough for any four peasants or threshers. It ate, shit, and pissed, and whenever someone touched it, it cried. When bad things happened in the house, it laughed and was happy; but when things went well, it cried. It had these two virtues. I said to the Princes of Anhalt: &quot;If I were the prince or the ruler here, I would throw this child into the water--into the Molda that flows by Dessau. I would dare commit homicidium on him!&quot; But the Elector of Saxony, who was with me at Dessau, and the Princes of Anhalt did not want to follow my advice. Therefore, I said: &quot;Then you should have all Christians repeat the Lord&#039;s Prayer in church that God may exorcise the devil.&quot; They did this daily at Dessau, and the changeling child died in the following year.... Such a changeling child is only a piece of flesh, a massa carnis, because it has no soul.<\/span><br>Source: Martin Luther, Werke, kritische Gesamtausgabe: Tischreden (Weimar: B\u00f6hlau, 1912-1921), v. 5, p. 9.","time":1493609017,"resto":123562002,"id":"5aFd++ct","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123571333,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)23:24:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123562210\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123562210<\/a><br><br>I love how protestants have no fucking clue what selling indulgences actually was.<br><br>protip: it did not mean you could buy a free pass to sin","time":1493609041,"resto":123562002,"id":"92N66KFD","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123571359,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)23:24:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123570952\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123570952<\/a><br>not the catholics","time":1493609053,"resto":123562002,"id":"2BB45gK3","country":"AR","country_name":"Argentina"},{"no":123571395,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)23:24:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123571087\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123571087<\/a><br><br>Man that sucks.<br><br>I should be moving to Maine later this year (granted the immigration paperwork goes through fine) because I&#039;m getting married to an American girl.<br><br>Been Church of England all my life and was trying to find something similar in the US.","time":1493609076,"resto":123562002,"id":"9joSNhRt","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123571505,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)23:25:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123571287\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123571287<\/a><br>You&#039;re no worse then the retarded peasantry who took his drunk ramblings seriously.

Further, he was eating a great deal and behaving very strangely. The man was told that he should take the child on a pilgrimage to Hockelstadt to praise the Virgin Mary and to have him weighed there. The peasant followed this advice and set forth, carrying the child in a basket. But when he came to a bridge over some water, a devil in the water beneath the bridge called out: &quot;Killcrop! Killcrop!&quot; The child in the basket, who had never yet spoken a word, answered: &quot;Ho! Ho!&quot; This startled the peasant. The devil in the water then asked: &quot;Where are you going?&quot; The killcrop said: &quot;I&#039;m on my way to Hockelstadt to Our Dear Lady, to have myself weighed there so that I may grow.&quot; When the peasant heard the changeling speak, the first time this had ever happened, he became angry and threw the child into the water, basket and all. Then the two devils came together, shouted &quot;Ho, ho, ha!,&quot; played with each other, rolled around with each other, and disappeared.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Satan plagues mankind with such changelings and killcrops by substituting them for real children. Satan has the power to exchange children, placing a devil in the cradle in the place of a child. This devil will suck and eat like an animal, but it will not grow. Thus it is said that changelings and killcrops do not live longer than eighteen or nineteen years.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;It happens often, that babies are exchanged during their first six weeks, and that devils lay themselves in their place, making themselves detestable by shitting, eating, and crying more than any ten other children. The parents get no rest from such filthy beasts. The mothers are sucked dry and are no longer able to nurse.... However, changeling children should be baptized, because they cannot always be recognized as such during their first year.<\/span>","time":1493609272,"resto":123562002,"id":"5aFd++ct","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123571793,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)23:28:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"we winning over the sneaky pest","filename":"winning","ext":".png","w":798,"h":770,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":120,"tim":1493609293167,"time":1493609293,"md5":"pvFuzWXBi3vmBWtyyYw6Kw==","fsize":692589,"resto":123562002,"id":"lgMhVgas","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123571853,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)23:28:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123562210\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123562210<\/a>","filename":"halal","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":539,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":105,"tim":1493609324821,"time":1493609324,"md5":"hIA9gdHGcM2z7C+zmf9wFQ==","fsize":82171,"resto":123562002,"id":"EAcE0Mv1","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123571879,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)23:28:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123562002\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123562002<\/a><br>Wait till he finds out about Henry Fords the eternal Jew","filename":"l_129459_075257_updates","ext":".jpg","w":700,"h":390,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":69,"tim":1493609338000,"time":1493609338,"md5":"P+lFJ6ofLcKl+0j8uRFHWw==","fsize":68099,"resto":123562002,"id":"KlGhjUFL","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123571931,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)23:29:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123564205\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123564205<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;United against Ursury.<\/span>","time":1493609361,"resto":123562002,"id":"EAcE0Mv1","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123571950,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)23:29:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123571359\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123571359<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Protestant education <\/span><br>Not even once","time":1493609372,"resto":123562002,"id":"FBejC96X","country":"CR","country_name":"Costa Rica"},{"no":123572007,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)23:29:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123571697\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123571697<\/a><br><br>Nice, there&#039;s one in Augusta.

However, as Luther\u2019s writings span over a quarter century, academic analysis is required to determine any discrepancies in his ideologies. Thus, for centuries scholars have engaged in various debates concerning Luther\u2019s changing stance on Jews, most prominently noticed when comparing Luther\u2019s earliest and latest works on the subject. Heiko Oberman, the leading scholar on Luther and his attitudes towards the Jews of Germany, writes in Roots of Antisemitism that \u201cThat Jesus Christ Was Born a Jew is readily adduced today to soften the features of the supposedly malicious old Luther\u2026Yet Luther\u2019s critique of Judaism as a religion is just as uncompromising in 1523 as it is in the later years\u201d when he penned On the Jews and their Lies in 1543. While Oberman\u2019s assertion is still debated, this essay will argue in favor of Oberman\u2019s claim in addition to examining the four main points of contention that exist among scholars of Luther, the Jews, and the Reformation: why Luther defended Jews in That Jesus Christ was Born a Jew, whether a mass conversion of Jews was central to Luther\u2019s teachings, whether his opinions on Jews dramatically changed from 1523 to the publication of On the Jews and their Lies, and the source of any perceived ideological differences concerning the treatment of Jews in these works. This essay will focus exclusively on excerpts from these two writings while critically examining the scholarship in the field.","time":1493610295,"resto":123562002,"id":"xYVCpc4r","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123573844,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)23:48:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123573307\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123573307<\/a><br><br>It&#039;s not really worse and penance is not the same thing as suffering.

Conversion was the core of the movement. While Perry insists that this call to conversion was all-inclusive from the beginning, it was primarily the conversion of Catholics that concerned a Judeo-phobic Luther until an important moment in 1521. Salo W. Baron outlines in A Social and Religious History of the Jew the story of how at the Diet in Worms in April 1521, Luther successfully converted two Jews to join the Protestant faith through explanation of Old Testament predictions of the virgin birth of a redeemer. This personal and visible success proves invaluable in considering Luther\u2019s attitude toward conversion of the Jewish people in the following years. Regrettably, as it is not self-reported by Luther and is received from an unreliable source, its historicity is doubted by many scholars.","time":1493610699,"resto":123562002,"id":"xYVCpc4r","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123574270,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)23:52:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123562677\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123562677<\/a><br>Is there a non cropped version of this picture?

Mark Edwards expresses thus in Luther\u2019s Last Battles, stating that Luther neither expected a mass conversion nor only a few, but rather that, \u201cLuther had obviously hoped that at least some and perhaps an appreciable number of Jews might convert to Christianity once they were exposed to the Protestant faith.\u201d This ideology remained in Luther from his writing in 1523 to his 1543 work On the Jews and their Lies. Both works noted the simultaneous willingness to accept the conversion of some Jews while acknowledging the difficulty in this process. In That Jesus Christ was Born a Jew Luther, perhaps alluding to his meeting two years prior, Luther stated that \u201cit is true that some Jews do indeed feel how persuasive and conclusive this passage really is.\u201d However, Luther cited this understanding with an unwillingness to be converted, as he continued, \u201cthis is why they hunt up all sorts of weird ways of getting around it.\u201d These same conflicting stances on conversion were visible in On the Jews and their Lies, as Luther wrote, \u201cWe cannot\u2026convert the Jews. With prayers and the fear of God we must practice a sharp mercy to see whether we might save at least a few from the glowing flames.\u201d In comparing these two lines, it is obvious that Luther appreciated conversion, but did not expect it. Thus Oberman\u2019s theory gains credence, as he states, \u201cBut Luther stressed that he had always been and still was convinced that Jews ought to be treated \u2018in a friendly manner\u2019 to ensure that no obstacles stood in the way of their conversion by God. Luther held firm to this belief to the very end, even if this amiability turned into \u2018severe mercy.\u2019\u201d","time":1493610777,"resto":123562002,"id":"xYVCpc4r","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123574385,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)23:53:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123573468\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123573468<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Damnation pass<\/span><br><br>They were never once passed off as forgiveness.

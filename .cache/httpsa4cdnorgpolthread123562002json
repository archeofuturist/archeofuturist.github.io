Lutheran teaching is laid out most extensively in the Book of Concord in a series of confessional statements. Other denominations issued their own confessional statements such as the canons of Dort (Reformed\/Calvinist) or the 39 Articles (Anglicanism). <br><br>For Luther the fundamental pillar of the church is that man is saved by grace through faith, or in other words there is nothing that you can do to earn salvation but instead it entirely depends upon God&#039;s mercy toward you. <br><br>Also, why isn&#039;t the knowledge that this book exists more widespread?<br>One of the reasons is that not everything Luther wrote is considered doctrinally binding. The Book of Concord mentioned above contains the binding statements of the Lutheran Church and the scriptural defenses of the statements. On the Jews and their Lies wasn&#039;t in the Book of Concord and like much of Luther&#039;s writings probably wasn&#039;t considered.

Catholic doctrine of the time held that lending money for interest was a sin, and forbidden to Christians. Not being subject to this restriction, Jews dominated this business. The Torah and later sections of the Hebrew Bible criticise usury but interpretations of the Biblical prohibition vary (the only time Jesus used violence was against money changers taking a toll to enter temple). Since few other occupations were open to them, Jews were motivated to take up money lending. This was said to show Jews were insolent, greedy, usurers, and subsequently led to many negative stereotypes and propaganda. Natural tensions between creditors (typically Jews) and debtors (typically Christians) were added to social, political, religious, and economic strains.

For all authority flows and is propagated from the authority of parents. For where a father is unable alone to educate his [rebellious and irritable] child, he employs a schoolmaster to instruct him; if he be too weak, he enlists the aid of his friends and neighbors; if he departs this life, he delegates and confers his authority and government upon others who are appointed for the purpose. 142] Likewise, he must have domestics, man-servants and maid-servants, under himself for the management of the household, so that all whom we call masters are in the place of parents and must derive their power and authority to govern from them. Hence also they are all called fathers in the Scriptures, as those who in their government perform the functions of a father, and should have a paternal heart toward their subordinates. As also from antiquity the Romans and other nations called the masters and mistresses of the household patres- et matres- familiae, that is, housefathers and housemothers. So also they called their national rulers and overlords patres patriae, that is, fathers of the entire country, for a great shame to us who would be Christians that we do not likewise call them so, or, at least, do not esteem and honor them as such.<\/span>","time":1493606162,"resto":123562002,"id":"5aFd++ct","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123565865,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)22:36:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123565724\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123565724<\/a><br>lol","filename":"quote-i-feel-much-freer-now-that-i-am-certain-the-pope-is-the-antichrist-martin-luther-115934","ext":".jpg","w":850,"h":400,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":58,"tim":1493606164004,"time":1493606164,"md5":"62iIJ3tpwYdqxRXaBkGhYw==","fsize":41135,"resto":123562002,"id":"E51KqiDA","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123565883,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)22:36:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"Went to a private Lutheran school when i was younger (WELS)<br><br>Literally a fucking cult.<br><br>We did bible study until around 1pm and then spent the next 2 hours on math, reading, &quot;science&quot; and history<br><br>Shit was hilarious <br><br>I got suspended cause i beat the shit out of this black kid <br>Was kicked out of the church later that year cause my mom worked odd hours and couldnt make it to church every week","time":1493606178,"resto":123562002,"id":"Gd5DG5kE","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123565886,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)22:36:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123564250\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123564250<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Tradition is greatly respected by Lutherans<\/span><br><br>top lel.

Even sinners lend to sinners, expecting to be repaid in full. But love your enemies, do good to them, and lend to them without expecting to get anything back. Then your reward will be great, and you will be children of the Most High, because he is kind to the ungrateful and wicked.&quot;<\/span><br><br>Luke 6:34-35","time":1493607085,"resto":123562002,"id":"E51KqiDA","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123567755,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)22:52:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123567521\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123567521<\/a><br>What do you mean by that?<br>http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2010\/07\/26\/u<wbr>s\/26lutheran.html<br>With a laying on of hands, the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America on Sunday welcomed into its fold seven openly gay pastors who had until recently been barred from the church\u2019s ministry.","filename":"sub-lutheran-articleLarge[1]","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":330,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":68,"tim":1493607156843,"time":1493607156,"md5":"rLecph5cE7Spv71PFvmc8Q==","fsize":64874,"resto":123562002,"id":"cnIfC5ur","country":"IT","country_name":"Italy"},{"no":123567815,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)22:53:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123562372\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123562372<\/a><br>How fucking embarrassing for the papists.

The second repealed all the standing laws which kept Jews from the normal pursuits of the kingdom. Under these new statutes Jews could even lease land for a period of fifteen years and work it. Edward advanced this as a test of the Jew\u2019s sincerity when he claimed that all he wanted was an opportunity to work like other people. If they proved their fitness to live like other people, the inference was that Edward would let them buy land outright and admit them to the higher privileges of citizenship. Did the Jews take advantage of Edward\u2019s decree? This way. To get around the laws against usury they invented such new methods of skinning the peasants and the nobles that the outcry against them became greater than ever, and Edward had to expel them to avert a civil war. It was not recorded that one Jew took advantage of the new right to till the soil.<\/span><br><br>Solzhenitsyn also told a similar tale in 200 Years Together, about neglected and abandoned farms, where they were given some of the best and biggest plots to work.","filename":"jews-are-crooks","ext":".webm","w":498,"h":284,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":71,"tim":1493607499224,"time":1493607499,"md5":"fOYjD0Ux8dTPzW8iBQJsNQ==","fsize":3019254,"resto":123562002,"id":"Z6FBYDuj","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123568597,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)22:59:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123562493\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123562493<\/a><br><br>How known are Martin Luther&#039;s hardcore redpills about jews among Lutheran normies?","filename":"martin luther","ext":".jpg","w":800,"h":501,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":78,"tim":1493607566780,"time":1493607566,"md5":"fGUOJoX9IdjYIxPClwrK8g==","fsize":50910,"resto":123562002,"id":"VELn4B39","country":"MX","country_name":"Mexico"},{"no":123568647,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)22:59:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123562002\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123562002<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Literally responsible for tge Jewish world order<\/span><br>Fuck that Heretic <br><br>Catholic or Death<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;inb4 Orthodoxy<\/span><br>Orthodox, Assyrians, Romans and Coptics are all the same religion <br><br>You could commulgate in any of their churches regardless of your little differences","time":1493607589,"resto":123562002,"id":"FBejC96X","country":"CR","country_name":"Costa Rica"}]}

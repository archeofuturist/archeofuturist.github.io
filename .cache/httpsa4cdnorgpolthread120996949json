But the thing is, it&#039;s not baseless! It&#039;s perfectly logical, and it has statistics to boot. This board also allows you to post anonymously, so all the pent up anger you have against blacks that have been suppressed by modern media and social equality banter can be released here freely.<br><br>Over the course of the past 2 weeks, I&#039;ve lost trust in everyone around me. Call it insanity, but I&#039;m starting to believe everyone hates blacks on the inside. It&#039;s just repressed by overbearing social pressures and standards. I cannot walk down the street anymore without seeing a non black and thinking to myself &quot;That person hates me and my kind deep on the inside&quot;, nor can I look at my black brethren and think &quot;You have no idea just how much you are hated&quot;.<br><br>So, rather than whine and cry, I want to fix it. Blacks have not always been entirely ignorant and lazy, but we are now. Even the great empires of Mali, Songhai, and Ghana prove this (please note that I only label west african empires because that&#039;s where most american black trace back to). What happened to us?<br><br>I&#039;d say it&#039;s a mix of the media (which is poisoning even children of &quot;white man master race&quot;) and drugs, which run rampant in black communities. Black media encourages drugs, theft, rape, ignorance, and &quot;hit and quit&quot; sex. This poisons our children by them having to be raised in environments that are overflowing with drugs, thieves, and rapists. Even if they don&#039;t grow up in these environments, the media romanticizes it and makes it cool to do these things. It actively discourages learning, so most blacks don&#039;t learn. The media also encourages drug consumption, which leads to crackhead types and even more crime.<br><br>So how do we fix it? I&#039;m eager to see \/pol\/&#039;s opinion.","filename":"malcomx","ext":".jpg","w":970,"h":1455,"tn_w":166,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492133062896,"time":1492133062,"md5":"sugdlhIY2qK9tNlReQGP6A==","fsize":137575,"resto":0,"id":"NrDHdDGW","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"fixing-the-black-image","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":120997089,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)21:25:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120996949\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120996949<\/a><br>Make them side with the asians.","time":1492133123,"resto":120996949,"id":"OHxecmB+","country":"CL","country_name":"Chile"}]}

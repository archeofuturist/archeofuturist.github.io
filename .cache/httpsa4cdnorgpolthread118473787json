High functioning autism, also known as aspergers, is basically mild autism. People can still live normal lives if they&#039;re high functioning, but aren&#039;t born with social skills and need to learn them.<br>Low functioning autism is on the opposite spectrum where it&#039;s more severe and the autist is non-verbal and has screeching meltdowns.

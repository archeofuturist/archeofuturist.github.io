He builds legions, but he doesn&#039;t build a nation. A nation is created by families, a religion, traditions: it is made up out of the hearts of mothers, the wisdom of fathers, the joy and the exuberance of children... For a few months I was inclined to believe in National Socialism. I thought of it as a necessary fever. And I was gratified to see that there were, associated with it for a time, some of the wisest and most outstanding Germans. But these, one by one, he has got rid of or even killed... He has left nothing but a bunch of shirted gangsters! This man could bring home victories to our people each year, without bringing them either glory or danger. But of our Germany, which was a nation of poets and musicians, of artists and soldiers, he has made a nation of hysterics and hermits, engulfed in a mob and led by a thousand liars or fanatics. \u2015 Wilhelm on Hitler, December 1938.","filename":"51EE-9TQcPL._SY300_","ext":".jpg","w":225,"h":300,"tn_w":187,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493220474858,"time":1493220474,"md5":"\/gRFP3QYbEKAIYsmJhEPoQ==","fsize":19720,"resto":0,"id":"8Vri2L7+","country":"ES","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"kaiser-wilhelm-ii-on-hitler","country_name":"Spain","replies":4,"images":0,"unique_ips":5},{"no":122896216,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)11:35:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"He allowed his country to surrender when there was not a single enemy solider on the soil of his empire","time":1493220918,"resto":122895360,"id":"P8a5oBIL","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122896256,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)11:35:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122895360\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122895360<\/a><br>The Kaiser is entitled to his opinion, shame he wasn&#039;t equipped to overcome the Bolsheviki","time":1493220933,"resto":122895360,"id":"KSga7Baa","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122896540,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)11:38:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122896216\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122896216<\/a><br>and Hilter let enemy soldiers on home soil raping and pillaging.

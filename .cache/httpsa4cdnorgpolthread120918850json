USA declares war on DPRK.<br>What happens next? Does China become involved militarily, and if it does, whose side are they on? Does Russia get involved (I think it&#039;s unlikely for Korea, but it is right on their doorstep, and Vladivostok isn&#039;t that far away.<br><br>2. Syria happens.<br>Does Russia become involved? Does it use this as a false flag, and use its full might to annex the rest of Ukraine and\/or Georgia? How would the EU and the USA respond?<br><br>3. An unknown flash point. Pakistan and India? China and all involved in the South China Sea, or maybe they finally take Taiwan? I think these are all unlikely, but not outside the realm of possibility.<br><br>Pic unrelated, but brownie points if you know what it is.","filename":"IMG_7836","ext":".jpg","w":3264,"h":2448,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1492095795694,"time":1492095795,"md5":"CthhLdw7hml6ZgpN4t8MhQ==","fsize":2067968,"resto":0,"id":"YypJuf2K","country":"AU","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"world-war-iii","country_name":"Australia","replies":16,"images":1,"unique_ips":4},{"no":120919277,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)11:07:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120918850\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120918850<\/a><br><br>good points<br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Wez<wbr>4iYWCnsQ&amp;lc=z12pyvexvtiavfsgx04cctw<wbr>xcqf1x1ybkbo","filename":"Screen Shot 2017-04-12 at 4.25.53 PM","ext":".png","w":1916,"h":1199,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":78,"tim":1492096079107,"time":1492096079,"md5":"gwatm3uZBfRZrlX4bn9EIQ==","fsize":2840485,"resto":120918850,"id":"pnnwTZWg","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":120919783,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)11:12:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120919277\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120919277<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&#039;all the world&#039;s top western spy agencies are trying to help Mossad create a &#039;greater Isreal&#039; a la ISIS&#039;<\/span><br><br>I&#039;m not sure I feel that tinfoiled..","time":1492096371,"resto":120918850,"id":"YypJuf2K","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":120920998,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)11:24:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120918850\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120918850<\/a><br>South China sea issue will become prominent as soon as the chinese build enough navy ships and submarines to be able to fend off americans.<br><br>When that happens, Taiwan is next.","time":1492097061,"resto":120918850,"id":"pMTe72iD","country":"SI","country_name":"Slovenia"},{"no":120922181,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)11:35:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120920998\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120920998<\/a><br>Well they better get building.

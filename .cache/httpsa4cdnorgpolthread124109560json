Even if it&#039;s just working out enough to look good and have some testosterone. Clean your room today at the very least. How can you expect others to respect you if you don&#039;t respect yourself?<br>2) Learn some skills like cooking, budgeting, home repair, etc. The more independent you are, the less a society can do to hold you hostage for having the wrong views.<br>3) Get your money in order. You don&#039;t need much, but have some savings. Maybe even buy some land out in the country where you can apply those skills you learned.<br>4) Don&#039;t recoil from accusations of racism or sexism. Racism must be normalized. Besides, once the accusation is thrown, you&#039;ll never have it off anyway. Embrace it and never lose your cool.<br>5) Try to network. That&#039;s not a dirty word. Go to a weekly church, stay in touch with your extended family, or just take a chance once in awhile and invite a potential friend or sexual conquest out for a drink or dinner or something.","filename":"german girls","ext":".jpg","w":960,"h":720,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1493931617432,"time":1493931617,"md5":"jbdCGP9bVRxe8uHFOiIhAg==","fsize":121861,"resto":0,"id":"AWz+fhkd","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"stop-giving-the-left-power-over-you","country_name":"Canada","replies":2,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":124109936,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)17:03:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124109560\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124109560<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;4) Don&#039;t recoil from accusations of racism or sexism.

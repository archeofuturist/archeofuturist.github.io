Its non-Muslim and non-Turkish inhabitants should either be forcibly islamized, or otherwise they ought to be destroyed. These gentlemen believe that the time is propitious for the realization of this plan. The first item on this agenda concerns the liquidation of the Armenians. Ittihad will dangle before the Allies a specter of an alleged revolution prepared by the Armenian Dashnak party. Moreover, local incidents of social unrest and acts of Armenian self defense will deliberately be provoked and inflated and will be used as pretexts to effect the deportations. Once en route, however, the convoys will be attacked and exterminated by Kurdish and Turkish brigands, and in part by gendarmes, who will be instigated for that purpose by Ittihad.<\/span>","time":1493051192,"resto":122600751,"id":"BB3n1eBB","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122603984,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)12:27:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122603428\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122603428<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;sandniggers<\/span><br>You shouldn&#039;t be dissing your own people. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The first inhabitants were the Britons, who came from Armenia (3), and first peopled Britain southward. <\/span><br><br>T.

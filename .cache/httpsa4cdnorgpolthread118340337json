I think a stalwart peasant in a sheepskin coat, born on the soil, whose forefathers have been farmers for ten generations, with a stout wife and a half-dozen children, is good quality. A Trades Union artisan who will not work more than eight hours a day and will not work that long if he can help it, will not work on a farm at all and has to be fed by the public when his work is slack is, in my judgment, quantity and very bad quantity. I am indifferent as to whether or not he is British-born. It matters not what his nationality is; such men are not wanted in Canada, and the more of them we get the more trouble we shall have.\u201d<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Sir Clifford &quot;warm your bodies in the soddies&quot; Sifton, then Minister of the Interior<\/span><br><br>Remember when Canadian liberals had good immigration policies?

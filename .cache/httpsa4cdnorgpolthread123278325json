If I was courted for being a moron than it would require only one person who thinks I&#039;m a moron and another judge who&#039;d agree with him and I&#039;d be a moron, and judge would note that a reasonable human being would understand moron as someone like me and up until a time when there&#039;s a new law regarding the moron status it would stay that way.<br><br>If people wanted to call me a moron, they can discuss and agree that I&#039;d fit the description of a moron and yeah that I&#039;d fit the legal definition of a moron and every court would agree with that.<br><br>But if it was because my exercise of free speech and if it was because I just got on the nerves of people even though I was harmless, Supreme Court might overrule that law saying it is discriminatory and against free speech. Law may remain but enforcement will be problematic just like burning the US flag.<br><br>So yeah, in short it might work that way, but it might not.","time":1493438052,"resto":123278325,"id":"US1\/W+fc","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123292155,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)23:54:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123291928\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123291928<\/a><br>Do you want to get your kebab removed?

This kurdish nationalist has to end and I think Erdogan is going to go hard on them as his country is divided and needs all turks behind him.

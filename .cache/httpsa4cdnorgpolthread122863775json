Before him will be gathered all the nations, and he will separate people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. And he will place the sheep on his right, but the goats on the left. Then the King will say to those on his right, \u2018Come, you who are blessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world. For I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me drink, I was a stranger and you welcomed me, I was naked and you clothed me, I was sick and you visited me, I was in prison and you came to me.\u2019 Then the righteous will answer him, saying, \u2018Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you drink? And when did we see you a stranger and welcome you, or naked and clothe you? And when did we see you sick or in prison and visit you?\u2019 And the King will answer them, \u2018Truly, I say to you, as you did it to one of the least of these my brothers, you did it to me.\u2019<br><br>\u201cThen he will say to those on his left, \u2018Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. For I was hungry and you gave me no food, I was thirsty and you gave me no drink, I was a stranger and you did not welcome me, naked and you did not clothe me, sick and in prison and you did not visit me.\u2019 Then they also will answer, saying, \u2018Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison, and did not minister to you?\u2019 Then he will answer them, saying, \u2018Truly, I say to you, as you did not do it to one of the least of these, you did not do it to me.\u2019 And these will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life.\u201d<br><br>How do you Christians on this board reconcile yourselves?","filename":"The Last Judgement","ext":".jpg","w":845,"h":600,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":177,"tim":1493197227146,"time":1493197227,"md5":"JNnUlF9Xu9AT1JhVgUihYg==","fsize":99309,"resto":0,"id":"bc05Eq3Q","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-last-judgement-btfo-pol","country_name":"United States","replies":3,"images":1,"unique_ips":4},{"no":122863874,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)05:02:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;he hasn&#039;t realized that \/pol\/ is just a bunch of hardcore liberals larping as Nazis yet<\/span>","time":1493197333,"resto":122863775,"id":"O5ju3YhO","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122863916,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)05:03:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122863775\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122863775<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;How do you Christians on this board reconcile yourselves?<\/span><br>What do you mean?","filename":"t. sedition pro","ext":".jpg","w":744,"h":3138,"tn_w":29,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493197387308,"time":1493197387,"md5":"kqoLJl+4t2lvPiqj8Mmucw==","fsize":1019653,"resto":122863775,"id":"pMlxSu+u","country":"GB","m_img":1,"country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122864073,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)05:05:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122863775\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122863775<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;And he will place the sheep on his right, but the goats on the left.

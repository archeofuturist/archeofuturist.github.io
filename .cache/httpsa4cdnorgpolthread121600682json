But it&#039;s okay because lol he can concentrate now. It wasn&#039;t until he was 15 and got into some serious health\/mental disorders and beat a schoolmate to near death while going through psychosis\/sleep deprivation that my parents finally stopped giving Adderall. And guess what? The psychiatrist was pissed and was trying to get my brother to continue taking Adderall while he was in a juvenile prison facility, even though he knew all the issues my brother had with that shit. In fact without him going to jail, idk how the fuck he would have been able to get off the shit. <br>At the end of the day, my brother dropped out of school because he was so burnt out by the time he got off Adderall he would not do shit at school.

It\u2019s based on real events: a top-shelf Holocaust denier D. Irving sued Holocaust historian and her publisher for libel and lost big time, the court ruled that, based on evidence, he\u2019s a falsifier with an agenda of racism and anti-semitism. For the thick ones: falsifier = fake \u2018historian\u2019.<br><br>So question to all the edgy Holocaust deniers: did you know about that?

During Iran\u2019s 2009 elections, Chavez offered \u201ctotal solidarity\u201d to Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, equating attacks on him as an assault by \u201cglobal capitalism,&quot;18 and condoned the brutal tactics of Iran\u2019s domestic militia, the basij, in their crackdown on opposition protesters.19 Iran reciprocated these friendly feelings. When he decorated Hugo Ch\u00e1vez with the Higher Medal of the Islamic Republic of Iran in 2008, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad called Ch\u00e1vez \u201cmy brother\u2026 a friend of the Iranian nation and the people seeking freedom around the world. He works perpetually against the dominant system. He is a worker of God and servant of the people.&quot;20 Ahmedinijad even risked a public embrace of Chavez&#039;s grieving mother at the caudillo&#039;s funeral, a move which scandalized the mullahs back home.<\/span><br><br><br>How much you wanna bet Venezuela will be the seat of Islamic expansion into the Western Hemisphere in the coming decades?<br><br><br>The wall can&#039;t come soon enough.","filename":"Tareck_El_Aissami_Portrait","ext":".jpg","w":800,"h":1068,"tn_w":93,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492652145227,"time":1492652145,"md5":"jHbiduMrTGcD2KYA9aMSCw==","fsize":228050,"resto":121922960,"id":"dW3s+J4p","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":121931692,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)21:36:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121925979\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121925979<\/a><br>Trump is fine being world policeman so long as he takes the oil and its not land war in middle east.<br>Killing Norks, Commies, etc. is good.","time":1492652217,"resto":121922960,"id":"xCLK84vY","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121932083,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)21:40:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121922960\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121922960<\/a><br>If he doesn&#039;t we will eventually, and this comes from the country that never does shit.","time":1492652410,"resto":121922960,"id":"\/8bzjNcM","country":"MX","country_name":"Mexico"},{"no":121933794,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)21:52:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121922960\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121922960<\/a><br>What do you mean &quot;dictator&quot;?<br><br>Fuck you, you fucking commie.

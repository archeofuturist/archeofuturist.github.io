The issues surrounding it is you need to find large enough heat reservoirs that you can draw on for extended periods of time. <br><br>During my undergraduate we had a presentation from a New Zealand company that operates a geothermal plant, and the lad explained a lot of the issues to us. One main issues is judging how much heat you can withdraw, without depleting the heat reservoir too quickly. Additionally most heat reservoirs are close to volcanic areas, due to the larger quantities of underground heat in those areas.<br><br>As well there are issues regarding scaling of the piping systems coming from the underground. The most advanced geothermal plants have a closed loop system, that uses a heating-fluid to gather heat from the underground and a heat exchanger to transfer it to a steam loop. The problem is when you pump a large volume of the heating fluid underground into a reservoir you bring up large amounts of sediments and other products in the fluid (low-quality steam essentially). This clogs up the pipes and means the heat transfer rates drop significantly.<br><br>Geothermal still has potential, but it would be hard to do feasibly on a large scale.","time":1492969167,"resto":122451298,"id":"6FIQn\/SJ","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"},{"no":122453540,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)13:39:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"Econ here.

The majority of the costs of modern medicine take place as a result of either working citizens being bankrupted by medical costs (from hospital chargemasters), or in the actual &quot;institutional&quot; or &quot;facility&quot; fees the hospital lobbies into the price of care. The actual expenditures found in brand name drugs, costly surgeries, and equipment are usually recouped in the first month or so of their utilization by the hospital, or simply passed onto the tax payers in the form of paying for institutions that maintain a status of &quot;non-profit&quot; despite a 50% return net income compared to expenditures. <br><br>There is certainly some level of collusion between pharma and the government, but it makes sense that you would require a monolithic institution to formulate, synthesize and test a new drug and dispense it out into the population. However what does NOT make sense is the notion that it is impossible to work as a private practice doctor seeing individual patients and having to spend 80k\/yr on paying a fucking medical accountant to ensure all your boxes are checked before you can wait 2 months for a payment to roll in. This is inherently harmful to the medical system and only further establishes a monopoly on healthcare as held by &quot;public&quot; hospitals. <br><br>Shit man, if you actually are an economist and you want to comment on the state of medical economics I would hope that you had at the very least read &quot;The Bitter Pill&quot; and become acquainted with where your fucking dollars are actually going. When a hospital charges you $1.50 for a fucking generic tylenol, that value doesn&#039;t go to the manufacturer, because the hospital buys them by the truckload at a cost of $0.05\/tablet.

Happened in Romania too - in Dobrogea.<br><br>The thing is, most projects stagnated in the last 1 to 2 years because they hit the brick wall of not having energy storage while subsidies took a dip. The market hasn&#039;t stopped giving lower and lower prices, but the end point is - it&#039;s not going to be an on-grid revolution. As long as you&#039;re tied to the on-grid thinking, you&#039;re going to see solar be outcompeted by everything for the next 10 to 20 years.<br><br>The big leap is in combining them with local storage. That&#039;s where it&#039;s profitable to install solar. You slash a huge amount of costs by simply not having to go through the grid. There&#039;s a catch btw - selling energy on the grid also incurs costs and makes all the grid stability fanatics go haywire.<br><br>Rooftop generation and local storage is the way for solar. It exploits the big advantage of solar - solar panels don&#039;t have to be big like hydroelectric or nuclear powerplants or even coal.<br><br>Just for numbers btw, right now the biggest hurdle is storage, without which solar is, in fact, effectively useless for the normal consumer. Right now, batteries cost about 450\u20ac\/kWh and can undergo ~4000 cycles of charge\/discharge. That means 11 \u20accents per actual kWh stored and then used, with the prices expected to go down in the next few years. For comparison, in Romania energy prices from the grid are already above that - ~14 \u20accents per kWh, and only going to rise. Of course, you have to include solar into that - iirc, around 4 to 5\u20accents per kWh in lifetime","time":1492976067,"resto":122451298,"id":"euXswi4K","country":"RO","country_name":"Romania"},{"no":122472545,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)15:35:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122471287\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122471287<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;2017<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;worshipping a kike on a stick<\/span>","time":1492976104,"resto":122451298,"id":"RRpJoSg9","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":122472688,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)15:35:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122451298\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122451298<\/a><br><br>Is it not true that Trump is cutting science funding?","filename":"science","ext":".jpg","w":900,"h":1200,"tn_w":93,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492976149254,"time":1492976149,"md5":"HRNAKZVnZSkeDXUZVF3A4w==","fsize":171721,"resto":122451298,"id":"xdq9Gh0U","country":"HU","m_img":1,"country_name":"Hungary"},{"no":122472725,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)15:36:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122472294\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122472294<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;practices ceremonial magic<\/span><br>for purely scientific purposes i assume?","time":1492976164,"resto":122451298,"id":"eGLQX3AB","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":122472787,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)15:36:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122471154\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122471154<\/a><br>True.<br>Undergrad in BME, Masters in Mechanical current PhD student studying injury biomechanics, dabbling in terminal ballistics because I&#039;ve done a lot of impact research with football and TBI.","time":1492976184,"resto":122451298,"id":"NNFYhO0i","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122472790,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)15:36:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122468888\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122468888<\/a><br><br>No one in their right might denies that IQ exists or that it is important. <br><br>It just that the measurements are extremely off and the performance on tests can greatly vary based on what you were learned and where you grew up, although technically they should absolutely not be susceptible to that influence.

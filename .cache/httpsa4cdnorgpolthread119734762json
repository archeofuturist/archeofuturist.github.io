The theory I hear from the right is that the Great Society programs by LBJ that created welfare state which incentivized single motherhood in the black community led to extreme rates of wedlock. As we know kids born without fathers are much more likely to engage in illicit behavior. Essentially the welfare state led to mass wedlock which in turn led to poverty and crime.<br><br>The theory I get from the left is that the poverty and crime in the black community stems from the war on drugs and the targeting of black men and minorities by the Nixon administration. <br><br>My question is which theory is correct?

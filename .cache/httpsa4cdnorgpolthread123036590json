Police also searched 16 locations in Germany, Austria and France that yielded evidence.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Investigators believe the lieutenant was motivated by a &quot;xenophobic background&quot; to plan an attack, possibly on migrants and refugees.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Prosecutors said the man hid a loaded weapon in a bathroom at Vienna airport in January. He was then briefly arrested by Austrian police when he returned in February to retrieve it. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;They later released the soldier due to insufficient evidence. However, the suspect&#039;s fingerprints indicated he had in late 2015 used an alias to falsely register as a Syrian refugee in Germany. In early 2016, he applied for asylum. He was subsequently granted accommodation and even received aid money.<\/span><br><br>http:\/\/www.dw.com\/en\/german-soldier<wbr>-arrested-for-alleged-terror-plans\/<wbr>a-38609200","filename":"1461460042001","ext":".jpg","w":1520,"h":850,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":139,"tim":1493300058852,"time":1493300058,"md5":"ZKgbcueyDjxkBprJ48Expg==","fsize":106672,"resto":0,"id":"9hUUPEAa","country":"DE","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"german-soldier-arrested-for-alleged-terror-plans","country_name":"Germany","replies":28,"images":9,"unique_ips":18},{"no":123036702,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)09:35:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"B A S E D","time":1493300136,"resto":123036590,"id":"h3qRwc0q","country":"EE","country_name":"Estonia"},{"no":123036775,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)09:36:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;The soldier apparently didn&#039;t attract the attention of authorities, even though he spoke French but no Arabic.

Blacks could only take so much hatred for their color, the same happened with the Irish, the Mexicans, etc. Whites are no different, except it could be more destructive.

I&#039;m 21 now and all the fucked up tranny shit and acceptance of flamboyant homos, support for nigger thugs like Mike Brown and things like that were originally what drove me to start looking at the right. The more I got into it the more I realized how fucked up and illogical leftists are. I think the younger kids who got it worse than me (I feel like this stuff was in the early stages when I was young, now it&#039;s full blown) will be driven more to the right. At this point WE are the counter culture and the status quo is accepting mentally ill trannies and thinking we should force tax payers to pay for tyronqueshia&#039;s college. I see the pendulum swinging back personally, plus it&#039;s natural for teenagers to want to be in the counter culture, which is conservatism at this point. Of course the weak minded people will still be indoctrinated into liberalism but it&#039;s pretty funny to see my 16 year old brother and his friends hate fags and other degenerates.","time":1492357090,"resto":121369970,"id":"yO37CAQk","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121373332,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)11:58:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121370440\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121370440<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;the cancer gets purged starting from the roots (the academia)<\/span><br><br>The real cancer is your predilection to fall for lies and repeat them. <br> <br>List of right-wing conspiracy theories about Obama that insanely gullible conservatives fell for without question:<br><br>--&gt;He&#039;s a socialist communist Marxist fascist muslim<br>--&gt;Fake birth certificate<br>--&gt;Born in Kenya<br>--&gt;Working with Muslim Brotherhood<br>--&gt;Refused to pledge allegiance<br>--&gt;Is the anti-Christ<br>--&gt;Wears a Koranic ring with cryptic verses<br>--&gt;Confiscated your guns<br>--&gt;Declared martial law to run for third term<br>--&gt;Watched\/directed Benghazi attack via drone<br>--&gt;Ordered &quot;Texas takeover&quot;<br>--&gt;Foreign troops on US soil<br>--&gt;Deliberately brought Ebola to US<br><br>List of other debunked or entirely ridiculous conspiracy theories that gullible right-wing conservatives fell for without question:<br><br>--&gt;Sandy Hook and other false flags<br>--&gt;FEMA camps to round up conservatives<br>--&gt;Giant coffin liners <br>--&gt;&quot;Cultural Marxism&quot;<br>--&gt;Mind control chemtrails behind jets<br>--&gt;Fluoride to poison the people<br>--&gt;9\/11 was an inside job<br>--&gt;Vaccinations cause autism<br>--&gt;HAARP weapons to cause earthquakes<br>--&gt;Jews and the Federal Reserve<br>--&gt;War on Christmas<br>--&gt;Massive Voter Impersonation Fraud<br>--&gt;UN Agenda 21 socialist communist Marxist fascist something or other<br>--&gt;Earth&#039;s climate never changes<br>--&gt;Communists everywhere<br>--&gt;Eschatologists and scatologists<br>--&gt;Alien lizards<br><br>It&#039;s just fucking embarrassing how insanely credulous the right has become.

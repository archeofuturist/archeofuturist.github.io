He also allied to Austria, knowing that they were fractured and dying. He should have allied to the UK and stayed out of the whole shit-show, then at some later date gone after Russia in the 1920&#039;s. We could have freed all of Eastern Europe, prevented communism, prevented the Nazis and all that shit, prevented World War Two itself, had Kaiser Wilhelm not blown his load too early and attacked Belgium.","time":1493137806,"resto":122738742,"id":"jgKx6QNt","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

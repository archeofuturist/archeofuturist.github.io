I used to think democrats still had some worth and could be reasonable. Since Trump won the Republican nomination I started to become more and more sceptical of that belief. When Trump won it removed all belief I ever had that the democrat were ever going to be redeemable. You are a shadow of your former selves. They dignity and integrity of your party is gone and all we have in place of it is a bunch of punks who think it&#039;s cool to be violent just because someone disagrees with them. You used to be the party that said violence was never the answer to anything. Now violence is your own answer. You have fallen far.","time":1492374850,"resto":121407572,"id":"ad2ERusa","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

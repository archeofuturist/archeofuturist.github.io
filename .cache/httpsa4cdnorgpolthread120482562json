Bringing the North&#039;s infrastructure and administration up to Southern standards would take a century or more.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The Chinese want absolutely nothing to do with North Korea beyond one thing: a buffer state that prevents US bases in Korea from being on China&#039;s doorstep. Also, if North Korea falls, they have a perhaps even worse refugee crisis than South Korea. <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The US basically wants to keep its bases on the Korean peninsula to counter the Russians and Chinese. And to not have its allies bombed, kthxbye.<\/span><br><br>Solution: <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Make a deal with China to only have a partial Korean reunification. The Northernmost part of North Korea and portions (but not all) of Jilin and Liaoning provinces will be broken away from Korea and China to form a new buffer state - call it Manchuria or whatever. The US recognizes that this new state is China&#039;s vassal and that it is China&#039;s responsibility to prevent it from ever possessing nuclear weapons or other WMD&#039;s.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;So long as China continues to keep this new state out of trouble, then the USA will abide by the next condition: No new US military bases beyond the 38th parallel. Just like before. The state of Korea is permitted to construct defensive bases, but these are restricted to defensive and peacekeeping.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In exchange for all this, China and the USA will topple the North Korean government. The Chinese will cut off all support slowly over a period of months and assist US forces in a swift and decisive action against Nork nuke arsenals, missile silos, and artillery positions. Kim Jong Un is to be assassinated along with his inner circle. North Korea goes away as a state and everybody focuses back on the real issue: Taiwan and the South China Sea.<\/span>","filename":"1362706581228","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":368,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":184,"tim":1491854635641,"time":1491854635,"md5":"csDzMxf2\/krGO4AlQ\/e5gg==","fsize":146791,"resto":0,"id":"ehM1yxqG","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"how-to-solve-the-north-korean-problem","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":120483701,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)16:12:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120482562\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120482562<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;No new US military bases beyond the 38th parallel<\/span><br>idk m8 couldn&#039;t we reunify the whole country and agree to that anyway? hell, make it one big demilitarized zone.","time":1491855153,"resto":120482562,"id":"mkdNY++L","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

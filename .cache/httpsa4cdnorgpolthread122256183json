Who knows? Certainly not the White House.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Trump tweeted today that it&#039;s China&#039;s job to deal with North Korea. And the powerful Navy armada he&#039;d bragged last week about sending to the Sea of Japan to intimidate Kim Jong-un turns out to have been 3,000 miles away from the Korean peninsula at the time. So the U.S. isn&#039;t really doing anything in that area right now either.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The administration has reportedly decided it can&#039;t make significant changes to NAFTA.

Do you know why we hold the majority of wealth? Because we&#039;ve worked our entire lives, slowly building on it. When we die, our kids will inherit that and they&#039;ll become the new boomers. And then after that, you will. <br><br>The idea is each generation progressively gets richer and richer. I know it&#039;s shitty for you now and you can&#039;t go buy a house in melb\/sydney but why the fuck would you want to live in those cesspools anyway?<br><br>You can still buy affordable homes in the other cities\/or the country if you&#039;re a real man and slowly work on increasing your wealth. Eventually you&#039;ll inherit something. <br><br>Or you can shitpost on here, blame me for all your problems and get nowhere in life.","filename":"1439352144486","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":433,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":169,"tim":1493185992488,"time":1493185992,"md5":"M47hjDNC\/Okn0qpVwD2yiA==","fsize":71837,"resto":0,"id":"cPgkjJ4m","country":"AU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"boomer-here","country_name":"Australia","replies":6,"images":0,"unique_ips":5},{"no":122851040,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)01:56:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;generation didn&#039;t have kids<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;expects to get a pension<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;economy forced to import workers to pay for them while they die off<\/span>","time":1493186167,"resto":122850808,"id":"uRA\/3Gta","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122851111,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)01:56:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"boomers should honestly just be put down at this point","time":1493186214,"resto":122850808,"id":"jziOvZ8+","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122851186,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)01:57:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122850808\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122850808<\/a><br>We don&#039;t deserve a car, but your generation got damn well nicer cars than we did, at least in the U.S. And that&#039;s a fact.

The fact is that he did a 180 on nearly every one of his campaign promises. The fact is that he ordered a missile strike on a sovereign country without congressional approval or UN mandate, on behalf of globalist-neocon atrocity lies. The fact is that US relations with Russia aren&#039;t even slightly better than under Obama, they&#039;ve actually worsened. All these facts clearly indicate that Trump is not a sovereign actor. What his motives are; whether he was lying all along or whether he had good intentions but was &quot;broken&quot; by the deep state matters little. Only the results do.<br><br>My personal theory is that he had some good intentions but that he is also a bit of an idiot, and that he doesn&#039;t have a lot of backbone which made it very easy for certain elements in his inner circle and various military advisors to mold him into an easily controllable puppet. It&#039;s also possible that CIA\/Mossad have developed advanced mind control devices to remotely move around any president as they see fit.","filename":"1394798635384","ext":".jpg","w":285,"h":279,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":122,"tim":1493589476297,"time":1493589476,"md5":"6FzpZJk1UBunJeRPW4y\/jw==","fsize":16210,"resto":123517276,"id":"0Fg937R7","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"}]}

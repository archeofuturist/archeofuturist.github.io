I start buying guns then. A 9mm, an AR-15, and finally a 357 magnum. I train and shoot and get good at shooting the pistol out to 15 yards and the rifle out to 150. Not the best ranges but perfectly fine for holding out from ravenous niggers. Suddenly Trump gets elected and I&#039;m all hype but on some level I miss the happening threads we had here when BLM would chimp out in a city. I would sit with my guns and a warm cup of coffee and bantz with everyone.

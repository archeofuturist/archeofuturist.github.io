I start buying guns then. A 9mm, an AR-15, and finally a 357 magnum. I train and shoot and get good at shooting the pistol out to 15 yards and the rifle out to 150. Not the best ranges but perfectly fine for holding out from ravenous niggers. Suddenly Trump gets elected and I&#039;m all hype but on some level I miss the happening threads we had here when BLM would chimp out in a city. I would sit with my guns and a warm cup of coffee and bantz with everyone. I&#039;m kind of hoping it happens again soon.","time":1492320136,"resto":121321548,"id":"63BFEN5+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121321884,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)01:22:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121321548\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121321548<\/a><br>soros ran out of money","time":1492320138,"resto":121321548,"id":"jfbw7uF\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121321913,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)01:22:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121321548\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121321548<\/a><br>Seems like their funding was cut late in the election when someone realized that they were hurting the cause rather than helping it.","time":1492320148,"resto":121321548,"id":"AUoBRRU7","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121322024,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)01:23:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121321548\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121321548<\/a><br>Funding dried up when Hillary lost","time":1492320213,"resto":121321548,"id":"oUVEIBoY","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121322043,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)01:23:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121321548\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121321548<\/a><br>Soros doesn&#039;t need to deploy them yet","time":1492320224,"resto":121321548,"id":"oUuA4RwU","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121322129,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)01:24:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121321548\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121321548<\/a><br>People figured out they were Marxist puppets.<br><br>They commanded, at best, the support of a third of black people, but I&#039;m guessing they&#039;ve been losing traction since then.

He started going for the throat of feminism and was talking about in with a frankness I hadn&#039;t seen out of anyone in a long time. I reckon plenty like me saw this and started realising which side of free speech they&#039;d prefer to be on.<br><br>As far as the whole pedo thing he was talking about how he was molested as a child, which as far as i&#039;m concerned is his experience and story to own, and he can and should deal with it however he wants. He&#039;s just about the last person in the world you want to try and talk out of saying something that goes against the grain in the first place. What he actually said in the podcast was that he was talking from his own experiences, and that in his experience it isn&#039;t so bad for a &quot;boy&quot; (commonly used in the gay community to simply mean a younger man, not necessarily someone underage) to seek out an older man, just as he did. Now obviously someone like him who has a target on his ass *snigger* should have been more cautious in how he phrases these things, but anyone who looks at this in context will understand what he meant.<br><br>In any case he makes light of these things all the time. He came out to do a talk at a college once wearing a priest&#039;s outfit and the first thing he said was &quot;I know what you&#039;re all thinking: if they all looked this good maybe you wouldn&#039;t hear about so many of those kids complaining.&quot;","time":1493525699,"resto":123426385,"id":"6BJBYfUs","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":123434215,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)00:15:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123426471\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123426471<\/a>","filename":"1493339458960","ext":".png","w":637,"h":630,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":123,"tim":1493525703847,"time":1493525703,"md5":"Q52EPdQEyzbwCcuSOyc4WQ==","fsize":788968,"resto":123426385,"id":"TdCqkRRF","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123434661,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)00:19:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123426385\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123426385<\/a><br>Last I heard he was banging kids","time":1493525950,"resto":123426385,"id":"mDJXPDgq","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123435332,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)00:25:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123434207\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123434207<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;T_D newfaggot redditor<\/span><br>of course<br>go back please","time":1493526353,"resto":123426385,"id":"uekhPHkt","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123435578,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)00:28:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123435332\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123435332<\/a><br>He&#039;s upset someone has a different opinion to him :(<br><br>Poor baby :(","time":1493526507,"resto":123426385,"id":"6BJBYfUs","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":123435985,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)00:32:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123426385\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123426385<\/a><br><br>His career is a shadow of what it used to be.

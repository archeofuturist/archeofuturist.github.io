Meat is extremely rare in the diet because it&#039;s become so expensive. IN addition the quality of food has dropped dramatically as inflation has made it unprofitable to make the high quality food that the Japanese have enjoyed until the late 90&#039;s. Instead you ahve juice with only 20% content, food that is heavily saturate with suga and salt, rice which the japs strip of all the nutrients when they turn it white and the worst of all is that most japs eat out of the convenience store daily. This means that they have awful diets. It&#039;s one of the main reasons they have massive dental issues because there is so much sugar in their diets.

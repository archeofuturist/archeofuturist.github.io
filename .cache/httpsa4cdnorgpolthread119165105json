Resulting in the Russians and Americans intervening to destabilise them. In order to put people into power who did listen to them, or at least didn&#039;t listen to the other guy.<br><br><br>Then there is Israel. Which sees the concept of united, stable Arab nations as it&#039;s death (quite accurate going by history) and thus they spend large amounts of money keeping the region broken up between people who can&#039;t threaten them and won&#039;t work together.<br><br>Add in the influence of the Saudi&#039;s, funding radicalism for their particular branch of Islam and also the use of it by other states to motivate their armies etc.<br><br>Plus to top it off, every time someone who isn&#039;t completely cancerous gets into power. A normal - conventional and reasonable - dictator, they are killed because they use chemical weapons, biological weapons, try to develop nuclear weapons, oppress their people \/ a minority or invade a neighbour.<br><br><br>There are a bunch of other reasons but essentially, no one wants it to end. The west wants it because it lets them strip us of our rights, the middle east wants it because it grants them a right to rule. The east and africa? They have no real stake in this fight and thus watch from the sidelines, occasionally getting a few sparks their way.<br><br><br>Still, it could be worse. The balkans could explode into another racially, religiously, nationalistically motivated series of civil wars at any moment...","time":1491041549,"resto":119165105,"id":"JOkuMxpf","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"}]}

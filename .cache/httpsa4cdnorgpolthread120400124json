And this is not altogether fanciful. A speaker who uses that kind of phraseology has gone some distance toward turning himself into a machine. The appropriate noises are coming out of his larynx, but his brain is not involved, as it would be if he were choosing his words for himself. If the speech he is making is one that he is accustomed to make over and over again, he may be almost unconscious of what he is saying, as one is when one utters the responses in church. And this reduced state of consciousness, if not indispensable, is at any rate favourable to political conformity.","filename":"1491536283162","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":345,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":86,"tim":1491805771091,"time":1491805771,"md5":"vIG+7zDIwPlpkl7tgWkPLQ==","fsize":64029,"resto":120400124,"id":"qbl8fVeb","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120404391,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)02:29:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120403554\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120403554<\/a><br>Are the facist liberal women (and men who are basically in character) you see on viral youtubes just cluster B chicks of all sorts, or the rejected ones: uggos, obesity, dykes, gender dysphoria, polycystic ovary disease, american jews (israeli jews are not liberals), diddled as a kid, had a father who worked too much because he was disappointed he didnt have a boy (or a masculine one)? i guess all these factors overlap","time":1491805798,"resto":120400124,"id":"1VcOTs6i","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120404472,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)02:30:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120400124\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120400124<\/a><br>Role reversal is funny retard, don&#039;t get it?

It originated when the Normans conquered England. The plebs of England were not allowed to speak Old English and either couldn&#039;t learn or weren&#039;t allowed to speak the Norman language, which resembled modern French but with more Latin. <br><br>A &quot;pidgin&quot; language was born, which is when two languages are bastardized for easy communication, like using the phrase &quot;number 1&quot; during the US-Vietnam war to mean &quot;very good&quot; or &quot;high quality&quot;<br><br>Over time this evolved into middle English, which looks like German took a shit on Modern English (or conversely, that French and Latin took a shit on Old English)<br><br>The printing press, combined with the English love of story-telling and the literary genius of guys like Shakespeare and Christopher Marlowe actually caused English to evolve into the most descriptive and variable language in history. <br><br>Most languages don&#039;t have dozens of synonyms for every word, they don&#039;t (or didn&#039;t at the time) borrow words from other languages as readily as English-speakers always have, and because English became the language of some of the most influential literary and philosophical minds of the last 500 years, it is remarkably intact and verbose. <br><br>This might have just been a fluke though, because only recently (relative to history) have common people had access to education, literature, and written communication. <br><br>Educators have become increasingly less strict when teaching English and more emphasis is put on teaching contemporary work. Writers are not as valued by society now that we all have infinite videos, music, gaming, etc, so you have a population that generally doesn&#039;t care about grammar and vocabulary the way previous generations have valued those things. <br><br>Combine that with street slang, internet slang, and technology and in 50 years a love-letter written in the 90s might be like reading King James&#039; English.","time":1491809403,"resto":120400124,"id":"eRPptD9B","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120409221,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)03:30:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120402195\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120402195<\/a><br>Haha fuck you I was at multiple Trump rallies ALL UP IN the protesters shit every time.

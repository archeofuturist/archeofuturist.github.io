The Catholic church needed to sift through more than 50 Gospels, 22 Acts and many other writings during the gradual process of determining which Christian writings should be included in the NT. This process was completed by a decree of Pope St. Damasus I in 383, and confirmed at the councils of Hippo in 393 and Carthage in 397 and 419. Subsequently, the councils of Second Nicea in 787, Florence in 1441, and Trent in 1546 approved the identical canon of the bible that Catholics still recognize today as divinely inspired. The Church made this determination by drawing on sacred tradition.<br><br>In the 16th century, Luther rejected the seven books that comprise the deuterocanonicals together with parts of Daniel and Esther. He did so because they contained passages that disagreed with his theology. Luther claimed that all matters of faith and practice were based on the bible alone, but the bible never gave Luther the authority to determine the books that belong in the bible. Luther also questioned &quot;Whether James was in fact scripture&quot; along with Hebrews, Jude, and Revelation. He referred to Jude as a &quot;superfluous document&quot; and claimed that Revelation &quot;lacks everything that I hold as apostolic or prophetic.&quot;<br><br>Since protestants teach that the bible alone is their ultimate authority, each book of the bible has a cloud of suspicion hanging over it because the bible does not have an infallible table of contents that lists the books that are divinely inspired and, therefore, should be included in it. If, as Luther taught and protestants believe, the Catholic church was wrong about the deuterocanonicals, isn&#039;t it reasonable to suspect from that perspective that the Catholic church made other errors? Perhaps other books should be rejected from the bible?","time":1491740792,"resto":120272018,"id":"aQ+dDeLr","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120277426,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)08:31:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"Easter soon, fellow brothers.","filename":"2d5535d735bbace33f50ed15da80559b718c9a1a36172699a390f9c8da224ae5","ext":".jpg","w":940,"h":1270,"tn_w":92,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491741098387,"time":1491741098,"md5":"Y0rMoZovnTSM47MMaWdD0g==","fsize":137600,"resto":120272018,"id":"KtlHbmqV","country":"PL","m_img":1,"country_name":"Poland"},{"no":120278741,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)08:48:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120277004\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120277004<\/a><br><br>I really would love to see a protestant respond to this.

Do you believe in this, and, if so, why do you think the other depiction is now considered to be true by most?<\/span><br>The common depiction of a firey place where demons poke you with pitchforks is complete bunk, a result of the fanfiction that is the Inferno. Great poem, bad theology.<br><br>Hell is a place where man is entirely seperate from God. This is an act of love by God, as He gives us freewill, and should we choose to not act in accordance with God&#039;s law, He respects that choice, and gives the sinner a realm where they are free to live as they desired, as He would not force them to live in heaven, as that would forfeit their freewill. <br>But, as hell is devoid of God, the souls suffers eternal anguish, as it inately desires to be with God. That is what is meant by second death, and &quot;&quot;&quot;life&quot;&quot;&quot; without God is not life, but eternal death.<br>Now this next part comes to personal belief, and is not theology: I&#039;ve imagined hell to be like the red light district of a city. Sinners are everywhere, and it&#039;s replete with all forms of evil. Warlords rule over men, demons exist there, and it is as if there is no good, and men can only sin. You may be murdered every dsy, but can not die, and thus endure the most horrendous of suffering at the hands of your fellow man. You may get sick, but will not die, and eternally wallow in the sin of mankind, that which one choose. I also imagine that it is a very dark place, a supernatural form of darkness. No matter what, you can barely see your outstretched hand: there is no sun, no colors, all is dull, and light has never graced the place, for light comes from God.

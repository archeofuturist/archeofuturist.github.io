The Catholic church needed to sift through more than 50 Gospels, 22 Acts and many other writings during the gradual process of determining which Christian writings should be included in the NT. This process was completed by a decree of Pope St. Damasus I in 383, and confirmed at the councils of Hippo in 393 and Carthage in 397 and 419. Subsequently, the councils of Second Nicea in 787, Florence in 1441, and Trent in 1546 approved the identical canon of the bible that Catholics still recognize today as divinely inspired. The Church made this determination by drawing on sacred tradition.<br><br>In the 16th century, Luther rejected the seven books that comprise the deuterocanonicals together with parts of Daniel and Esther. He did so because they contained passages that disagreed with his theology. Luther claimed that all matters of faith and practice were based on the bible alone, but the bible never gave Luther the authority to determine the books that belong in the bible. Luther also questioned &quot;Whether James was in fact scripture&quot; along with Hebrews, Jude, and Revelation. He referred to Jude as a &quot;superfluous document&quot; and claimed that Revelation &quot;lacks everything that I hold as apostolic or prophetic.&quot;<br><br>Since protestants teach that the bible alone is their ultimate authority, each book of the bible has a cloud of suspicion hanging over it because the bible does not have an infallible table of contents that lists the books that are divinely inspired and, therefore, should be included in it. If, as Luther taught and protestants believe, the Catholic church was wrong about the deuterocanonicals, isn&#039;t it reasonable to suspect from that perspective that the Catholic church made other errors? Perhaps other books should be rejected from the bible?","time":1491740792,"resto":120272018,"id":"aQ+dDeLr","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120277426,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)08:31:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"Easter soon, fellow brothers.","filename":"2d5535d735bbace33f50ed15da80559b718c9a1a36172699a390f9c8da224ae5","ext":".jpg","w":940,"h":1270,"tn_w":92,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491741098387,"time":1491741098,"md5":"Y0rMoZovnTSM47MMaWdD0g==","fsize":137600,"resto":120272018,"id":"KtlHbmqV","country":"PL","m_img":1,"country_name":"Poland"},{"no":120278741,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)08:48:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120277004\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120277004<\/a><br><br>I really would love to see a protestant respond to this.

The Catholic church needed to sift through more than 50 Gospels, 22 Acts and many other writings during the gradual process of determining which Christian writings should be included in the NT. This process was completed by a decree of Pope St. Damasus I in 383, and confirmed at the councils of Hippo in 393 and Carthage in 397 and 419. Subsequently, the councils of Second Nicea in 787, Florence in 1441, and Trent in 1546 approved the identical canon of the bible that Catholics still recognize today as divinely inspired. The Church made this determination by drawing on sacred tradition.<br><br>In the 16th century, Luther rejected the seven books that comprise the deuterocanonicals together with parts of Daniel and Esther. He did so because they contained passages that disagreed with his theology. Luther claimed that all matters of faith and practice were based on the bible alone, but the bible never gave Luther the authority to determine the books that belong in the bible. Luther also questioned &quot;Whether James was in fact scripture&quot; along with Hebrews, Jude, and Revelation. He referred to Jude as a &quot;superfluous document&quot; and claimed that Revelation &quot;lacks everything that I hold as apostolic or prophetic.&quot;<br><br>Since protestants teach that the bible alone is their ultimate authority, each book of the bible has a cloud of suspicion hanging over it because the bible does not have an infallible table of contents that lists the books that are divinely inspired and, therefore, should be included in it. If, as Luther taught and protestants believe, the Catholic church was wrong about the deuterocanonicals, isn&#039;t it reasonable to suspect from that perspective that the Catholic church made other errors? Perhaps other books should be rejected from the bible?","time":1491740792,"resto":120272018,"id":"aQ+dDeLr","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120277426,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)08:31:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"Easter soon, fellow brothers.","filename":"2d5535d735bbace33f50ed15da80559b718c9a1a36172699a390f9c8da224ae5","ext":".jpg","w":940,"h":1270,"tn_w":92,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491741098387,"time":1491741098,"md5":"Y0rMoZovnTSM47MMaWdD0g==","fsize":137600,"resto":120272018,"id":"KtlHbmqV","country":"PL","m_img":1,"country_name":"Poland"},{"no":120278741,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)08:48:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120277004\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120277004<\/a><br><br>I really would love to see a protestant respond to this.

Do you believe in this, and, if so, why do you think the other depiction is now considered to be true by most?<\/span><br>The common depiction of a firey place where demons poke you with pitchforks is complete bunk, a result of the fanfiction that is the Inferno. Great poem, bad theology.<br><br>Hell is a place where man is entirely seperate from God. This is an act of love by God, as He gives us freewill, and should we choose to not act in accordance with God&#039;s law, He respects that choice, and gives the sinner a realm where they are free to live as they desired, as He would not force them to live in heaven, as that would forfeit their freewill. <br>But, as hell is devoid of God, the souls suffers eternal anguish, as it inately desires to be with God. That is what is meant by second death, and &quot;&quot;&quot;life&quot;&quot;&quot; without God is not life, but eternal death.<br>Now this next part comes to personal belief, and is not theology: I&#039;ve imagined hell to be like the red light district of a city. Sinners are everywhere, and it&#039;s replete with all forms of evil. Warlords rule over men, demons exist there, and it is as if there is no good, and men can only sin. You may be murdered every dsy, but can not die, and thus endure the most horrendous of suffering at the hands of your fellow man. You may get sick, but will not die, and eternally wallow in the sin of mankind, that which one choose. I also imagine that it is a very dark place, a supernatural form of darkness. No matter what, you can barely see your outstretched hand: there is no sun, no colors, all is dull, and light has never graced the place, for light comes from God.

I&#039;ve actually not heard of this one.<\/span><br>I actually do have photos, and the testimony of one doctor comte, who examined the corpse in 1928. He said as follows:<br>&quot;I would have liked to open the left side of the thorax to take the ribs as relics and then remove the heart which I am certain must have survived. However, as the trunk was slightly supported on the left arm, it would have been rather difficult to try and get at the heart without doing too much noticeable damage. As the Mother Superior had expressed a desire for the Saint&#039;s heart to be kept together with the whole body, and as Monsignor the Bishop did not insist, I gave up the idea of opening the left-hand side of the thorax and contented myself with removing the two right ribs which were more accessible. ... What struck me during this examination, of course, was the state of perfect preservation of the skeleton, the fibrous tissues of the muscles (still supple and firm), of the ligaments, and of the skin, and above all the totally unexpected state of the liver after 46 years. One would have thought that this organ, which is basically soft and inclined to crumble, would have decomposed very rapidly or would have hardened to a chalky consistency. Yet, when it was cut it was soft and almost normal in consistency. I pointed this out to those present, remarking that this did not seem to be a natural phenomenon.&quot;<br>Pic related is her corpse today.

If you try to solve the problem by positing an infinite series of boxcars, you haven&#039;t done away with the need for explaining the motion. You&#039;ve enlarged the problem infinitely. If you deny the existence of the engine, then you&#039;ve enlarged the need to find a much bigger and extraordinary cause for the motion of such a long line of boxcars. <br><br>Asking &quot;what moves god&quot; or &quot;where does god come from&quot; is like asking if every car on a train needs to be pulled, then what&#039;s pulling the locomotive? This is because god is a necessary act of being.<br><br>Now for fun let&#039;s consider just a few of the implications of what it means to be pure actual: <br><br>-Pure actual must be omnipotent because to not be able to do something would be unrealized potential<br>-Pure actuality couldn&#039;t pop in or out of existence because that would imply unrealized potential, so pure actuality must be eternal.<br>-Pure actuality must be non-physical because physical beings or substances can change forms or locations, both of which are unrealized potential<br>-An imperfection of any kind would be an unrealized potential, so pure actual must be perfect.","time":1491759088,"resto":120272018,"id":"aQ+dDeLr","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120308105,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)13:31:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120307798\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120307798<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Be nice heresey<\/span><br><br><a href=\"#p120286167\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120286167<\/a><br><br>You people are always &quot;muh READING<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;MUH SPELLBOOKS<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;MUH HISTORY<\/span><br>POSERS","filename":"b63534934218c897d387260b1594bf65","ext":".jpg","w":506,"h":767,"tn_w":82,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491759096297,"time":1491759096,"md5":"hT3u2g32MWRrVinabTGXAQ==","fsize":111993,"resto":120272018,"id":"m8wBVYwr","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120308256,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)13:32:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120307631\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120307631<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;not understanding Gematria is the only way to discern divine inspiriation.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;not understanding Pi is fingerprint of God.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;calling a christian Poo in Loo because he&#039;s trying to share the higher mysteries of Christ with you<\/span><br><br>Matthew 7:6<br>Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn again and rend you.<br><br><br>you&#039;re a pig, simple as that.","filename":"jesus-krishna","ext":".jpg","w":2354,"h":1802,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":95,"tim":1491759176359,"time":1491759176,"md5":"Q1+YSWUn3Mw5malTetqt3w==","fsize":1193479,"resto":120272018,"id":"lB4CTE86","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":120308329,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)13:33:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120307730\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120307730<\/a><br>You sound insane.","time":1491759215,"resto":120272018,"id":"opdu3fLA","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120308391,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)13:34:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"So I have two major questions.<br><br>1.

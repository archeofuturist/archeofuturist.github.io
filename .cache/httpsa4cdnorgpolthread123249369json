We emphasize the need for a general equilibrium approach to analyze this problem. The impact of immigrants on wages of U.S.-born workers can be evaluated only by accounting carefully for labor market and capital market interactions in production. Using such a general equilibrium approach we estimate that immigrants are imperfect substitutes for U.S.- born workers within the same education-experience-gender group (because they choose different occupations and have different skills). Moreover, accounting for a reasonable speed of adjustment of physical capital we show that most of the wage effects of immigration accrue to native workers within a decade. These two facts imply a positive and significant effect of the 1990-2004 immigration on the average wage of U.S.-born workers overall, both in the short run and in the long run. This positive effect results from averaging a positive effect on wages of U.S.-born workers with at least a high school degree and a small negative effect on wages of U.S.-born workers with no high school degree. <\/span><br><br>http:\/\/www.nber.org\/papers\/w12497","time":1493415662,"resto":123249369,"id":"UD9skE54","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123250163,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)17:43:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123249369\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123249369<\/a><br>That&#039;s just basic economic speculation and statistical guesses.<br>Economy cannot predict the social stagnation of receiving INDUSTRIAL amount of uneducated immigrants.","time":1493415783,"resto":123249369,"id":"RHp6b1ir","country":"MA","country_name":"Morocco"},{"no":123250617,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)17:46:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"We do not want degenerates and kikes running wildly within our borders.

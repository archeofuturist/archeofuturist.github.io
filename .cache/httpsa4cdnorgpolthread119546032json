East to West. It&#039;s not threatening in any real sense to the powers that be, but Islam&#039;s body count grows and people are getting angry. Add to that, there are cultures that are chomping at the bit to remove kebab like India and SEAsian Buddhists, along with governments who&#039;ve already taken steps to crack down on Islam like Russia and China.<br><br>Literally the only thing stopping a world wide kebab removal movement TODAY is the West, particularly Europe, and the repercussions aren&#039;t even military, since Europe has no army and America probably wouldn&#039;t get involved directly after the clusterfuck that was the last 16 years of warfare. Nobody wants to face the political and economic fallout of EU\/ United States sanctions, but if the European Union falls, whether by Islamic dominance or a much quicker nationalist take over, make no mistake, kebabs will be removed and EVERYBODY will get in on it.<br><br>If by then America has another Democratic President, which is unlikely because Trump is fucking killing it, he could stop the removal in Europe by deploying troops, but that&#039;s why any member States who drop out of the EU need local armies to pursue local interests and it&#039;d be best to do that now while an anti-American-led-nato President is in the white house.<br><br>We could make a killing selling our military bases, hardware, and training to states starting from essentially nothing. We will see it happen in our lifetimes, but it&#039;ll happen a lot sooner if LePen wins in France, but the writing is on the wall. The fever the developed world has now rivals the same one it felt to test out new WWI era military hardware or go to the moon and western politicians can only bottle that up for so long before they&#039;re forced to ride the wave of public opinion if they want to stay in office.","filename":"1470167278835-pol","ext":".jpg","w":960,"h":866,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":225,"tim":1491355218495,"time":1491355218,"md5":"B648zCb7MH7\/hrMmkiW\/RQ==","fsize":180749,"resto":0,"id":"ZNQw2S2J","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"right-now-every-single-world-power-is-dealing","country_name":"United States","replies":6,"images":2,"unique_ips":5},{"no":119548048,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)21:39:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119546032\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119546032<\/a><br>single self bump before I let the thread die.","time":1491356381,"resto":119546032,"id":"ZNQw2S2J","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119548749,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)21:45:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119546032\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119546032<\/a>","filename":"1234","ext":".jpg","w":960,"h":895,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":116,"tim":1491356734437,"time":1491356734,"md5":"VVxVYncAdVp\/hGpjmDqoAg==","fsize":348559,"resto":119546032,"id":"oYv+avqi","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119549308,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)21:50:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"1.

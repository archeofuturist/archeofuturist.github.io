I&#039;m not joking by the way, this is real.<br><br>It traces back to experiments in how to break a population, theories marxists worked on to install compliance in a population. It&#039;s something you&#039;ve probably seen discussed already in 1984; &quot;war is peace&quot;. You might also have seen the Star Trek episode where they try to make Picard say there are 5 lights instead of 4. The power of this technique is to get you to deny the obvious and conform to a blatant lie. It could be over something as trivial as the amount of lights in a room. Or the definition of &quot;racism&quot;. Most people don&#039;t see it as a hill to die on. Most people just accept it.<br><br>And here is where the power of the technique lies. Once you start denying the obvious and rearranging language in a way that suits them, you are completely lost. Basic definitions in an argument go out the window because you&#039;re stuck wondering what definition is being used at this moment. There&#039;s more energy and time trying to define what words mean than conversation about the subject matter.<br><br>So instead of a &quot;debate&quot; about racism; where today both right and left would simply say &quot;it&#039;s bad, don&#039;t do it&quot;, it&#039;s just another wedge issue. <br><br>They&#039;ve turned a moral principle and value that 99% of the population agrees on into a weapon and an infected sore instead of unity. Racism is suddenly not a closed subject, it&#039;s reopened with a new definition that only allows &quot;minorities&quot; (in reality blacks, because they always make it about blacks) to be victims of racism. White people are the ones that do racism. You know this because you almost never see a discussion of hispanic racism against black people. This is deliberate. You don&#039;t see the racism among asian people.

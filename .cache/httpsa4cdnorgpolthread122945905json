A NASA scientist says it is inevitable:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The fresh water of the Great Lakes is the lifeblood for our region, but in the future it may be seen as a lifeblood to other regions, too. That\u2019s just one thought shared with me by Jay Famiglietti, a hydrologist and Senior Water Scientist at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory...<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;GANZER: \u201cThe Great Lakes make up about 20% of the freshwater supply, in volume, in the world. How do the Great Lakes fit into this crisis? How does their health fit in?\u201c<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;FAMIGLIETTI: \u201cWell the health of course is very important, but from a quantity perspective you might imagine that there\u2019s a giant bullseye that can be seen from space that\u2019s sitting above the Great Lakes, meaning: it\u2019s a target-area in a sense for the rests of the country. Because there\u2019s so much fresh water, you can imagine that 50 years from now, well we\u2019re already talking about this, but 50 years from now there might actually be a pipeline that brings water from the Great Lakes to Phoenix. I think that\u2019s part of our future.\u201d<\/span><br><br>http:\/\/www.ideastream.org\/news\/nasa<wbr>-scientist-undoing-great-lakes-prog<wbr>ress-would-take-generations-to-reco<wbr>ver","filename":"1493202711566[1]","ext":".jpg","w":2018,"h":1365,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":169,"tim":1493243795141,"time":1493243795,"md5":"6Hm9e\/KfnAR7MpduXfQvww==","fsize":620165,"resto":0,"id":"xwDAK3uS","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"is-the-government-planning-to-send-great-lakes","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":122946172,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)17:58:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122945905\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122945905<\/a><br>Midwest anon here fuck you all get your own lakes.","time":1493243920,"resto":122945905,"id":"toL4eKXs","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

Of course, the UK government too wastes money but why subject ourselves to more waste than we have to, particularly in the age of austerity?<br><br>Reason To Leave The EU #21 The EU is not transparent - Many EU laws are discussed and drafted in informal meetings held between the &quot;trilogue&quot; - representatives of the European parliament, European Commission and EU Council.

As a result, the UK has had to turn away skilled immigrants to the UK this year at the same time as being powerless to turn away non-skilled EU migrants. If you believe in controlled immigration, it can only be fair with Britain outside the EU.<br><br>Reason To Leave The EU #24 The EU has done little to ensure peace in Europe - It is often argued that the only reason why Europe has largely been at peace since World War II is because of the EU, but this ignores the fact that it was NATO and the American nuclear umbrella, not the EEC (as it was then known) which was responsible for stopping an East-West conflict during the Cold War, for example. Furthermore, the EU did little to stop the conflicts on its doorstep in the Balkans during the 90s. Even if the EU were to disintegrate, war between European states would be no less irrational and unlikely than it is now.<br><br>Reason To Leave The EU #25 The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) - This policy is essentially a gigantic EU subsidy for the agriculture industry and takes up around 40% of the entire EU budget. Because the UK has a relatively small agriculture sector (approximately 0.6% of the economy compared to 3.6% in France for example) this means that CAP costs the UK rather than benefits it.","time":1490804575,"resto":118797155,"id":"KLCoPck5","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118802121,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)12:22:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118801794\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118801794<\/a><br>Wow the whole world is cucked except for us and you&#039;re turning on me?

He makes the claim that North brits, scotts, and some parts of Ireland, over many decades, developed a barbarian, skyrim like culture that revolved around cheap thrills and overt masculinity due to how quick life could end during this time(constant wars between brits&amp;scotts, clan wars, and marauders). There was no point in long time planning when the possibility of getting killed tomorrow was a likely possibility, thus, the demand for education and civility was abandoned in this culture.<br><br>During the development of pre civil war america, these type of whites migrated to the antebellum south and brought their sub culture with them. Once the anglos already residing there encountered these groups, they were instantly repulsed by their disdain for working, proneness to violence, neglect of education, sexual promiscuity, lack of entrepreneurship, reckless searches for excitement, lively music and dance, and touchy pride. This sub-culture came to be known as cracker culture.<br><br>Blacks during the same time period mostly resided in the south due to slavery. The theory is that since they lacked any culture and was assigned to the bottom of the social hierarchy with the crackers, and that the slaves already had a low opinion for life and their future like the whites from the places were cracker culture was birthed, they easily assimilated into the values of the culture. <br><br>This is also used by Sowell to theorize why Blacks committed 3-4x amount of crime more than whites pre 1960s, Blacks in those regions had higher crime rates just like the cracker whites but the difference being that a large number of whites also lived in the north offsetting any significant the white crime stats, while only a small amount of blacks lived there prior to the great migration.","time":1492530233,"resto":121687091,"id":"IIzUuj\/N","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121698038,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)11:44:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121694335\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121694335<\/a><br>So, you like inflation?<br><a href=\"#p121697523\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121697523<\/a><br>This guy gets it","time":1492530266,"resto":121687091,"id":"w7GK\/t2g","country":"MX","country_name":"Mexico"},{"no":121698108,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)11:45:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121689100\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121689100<\/a><br>No, not at all.

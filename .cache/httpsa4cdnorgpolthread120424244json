It&#039;ll end eventually, just gotta push through it. Think a lot of people have similar things in their early twenties.<br><br>Gonna say that I don&#039;t necessarily agree with everything said here though. What worked for me is drastically lowering my expectations and taking each day and moment as they came rather than forcing myself to be hyper-disciplined.<br><br>Firstly, don&#039;t worry about the ex. It&#039;s old news and time is the only thing that&#039;ll heal that wound if it&#039;s still fresh. Don&#039;t worry about getting a new GF either; if it happens then it happens but you can be bummed out even if you&#039;re in a relationship. Getting laid regularly isn&#039;t a cure all for what you&#039;re going through.<br><br>Secondly, keep in mind how young you are. Not saying this in a condescending fashion, but most people your age have no idea what they are doing. That comes with age. For now focus on getting by, take whatever job pays the bills and enjoy yourself. Once that&#039;s down the rest will fall into place.<br><br>As for getting a &#039;just to pay the bills&#039; job, think small. You could spend hours and hours filling our forms online to be rejected over and over, or you could head out and talk to a local business owner. Newsagents are always looking for staff to help with deliveries and stuff and it&#039;s paid hourly. Gets you out of the house nice and early too. You could also try grocers or butchers or any other small business you live near; just go in and ask to speak with the manager. You&#039;d be surprised how many independent places hire on the spot if you ask confidently.<br><br>Finally, try volunteering. Once you&#039;ve got a bit of income volunteering is great. It means you can dedicate time to something you&#039;re truly passionate about without it just being a means to a paycheck. Sounds faggy but I&#039;ve never felt as fulfilled as when I was giving my time to a good cause.<br><br>Hope you&#039;re feeling better soon anon","time":1491824148,"resto":120424244,"id":"088GlUOD","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120428024,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)07:36:32","name":"Preu\u00dfe The Local Alcoholic","com":"<a href=\"#p120427910\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120427910<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;eating food from a paki&#039;s<\/span><br>Why would you do this?","time":1491824192,"resto":120424244,"id":"+d00b4rO","country":"GB","trip":"!!1g9WUtblos+","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120428054,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)07:36:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120427755\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120427755<\/a><br>What&#039;s wrong with foreign food?

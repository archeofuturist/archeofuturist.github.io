This is how I was prior to finding \/pol\/. Initially, I felt I didn&#039;t connect at all with people around me, who I (sure) found to be dumb. Then, I accepted what your post is saying, and tried to be less judging, to adapt myself to them, to fit in, to accept them as they are. It works in the sense that you have more people around you. It doesn&#039;t in the sense that your feeling of loneliness does not go away. I don&#039;t identify nor connect with these people no matter what. I don&#039;t truly like their hobbies, I don&#039;t want to do what they want to do, I don&#039;t relate to their troubles or joys, I don&#039;t like spending time with them. But I still held on to the meme &quot;Don&#039;t judge. Who are you to judge? You&#039;re probably wrong, they are just different. Keep on trying to adapt.&quot;. It didn&#039;t work. I just felt miserable and unfulfilled around them, like a fucking fraud.<br><br>It was when finding \/pol\/ that I saw, putting apart the memes, my exact thoughts being properly articulated. I then started reading some old authors on politics, morality and philosophy in general; and I finally found people I 100% agreed on. It was then that I realized I was truly a conservative all along; that my aversion for what I saw around me was the exact same conservatives feel. So, now, I can even admit I&#039;m not better than these people. But I do believe the only way I cease to feel lonely is if I&#039;m able to surround myself with a group of like-minded people. I&#039;m sick of having people I spend time with. I want friends and true companionship.","time":1493569084,"resto":123481394,"id":"c2GwXYXS","country":"PT","country_name":"Portugal"},{"no":123493418,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)12:19:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123492357\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123492357<\/a><br>Well I&#039;m already mostly drinking water, I just started to say oh well ah soda in a while can&#039;t be so bad. <br>Now I&#039;m basically consuming it like sweets sometimes an energy drink a day if i feel tired.<br><a href=\"#p123492663\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123492663<\/a><br><a href=\"#p123492244\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123492244<\/a><br>so you guys suggest to just radically pull the break and stop it completely?","time":1493569162,"resto":123481394,"id":"LAXt4z1R","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":123493428,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)12:19:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123492551\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123492551<\/a><br>At least you can go &quot;ude p\u00e5 tur&quot; Not many temptations whey you are miles from everything, on foot in Jotun National Park, or whatever.

With civil asset forfeiture, police can seize cash, vehicles and even homes, provided only that the property is suspected of being used in a crime. Often, no charges or convictions are required. Senator Eric Brakey, along with a bipartisan group of cosponsors, introduced Senate Bill 888 March 7, which would require a criminal conviction before any property is seized, as well as close a loophole that allows local law enforcement to skirt state law by working with the federal government.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u201cBarring state and local law enforcement agencies from passing off cases to the feds is particularly important,\u201d writes Mark Maharrey for the Tenth Amendment Center. \u201cIn several states with strict asset forfeiture laws, prosecutors have done just that. By placing the case under federal jurisdiction, law enforcement can bypass the need for a conviction under state law and collect up to 80 percent of the proceeds from forfeited assets via the federal Equitable Sharing Program.\u201d<\/span>","filename":"5f414f9b897a4f8f8418e17ac694f09a","ext":".jpg","w":623,"h":960,"tn_w":162,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490820731137,"time":1490820731,"md5":"iW0z9Wn46Kpn04uJMIcYSQ==","fsize":187670,"resto":0,"id":"dxOtzuc2","country":"IL","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"in-2014-for-the-first-time-in-recorded-history","country_name":"Israel","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

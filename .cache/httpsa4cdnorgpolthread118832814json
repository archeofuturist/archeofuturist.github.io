With civil asset forfeiture, police can seize cash, vehicles and even homes, provided only that the property is suspected of being used in a crime. Often, no charges or convictions are required. Senator Eric Brakey, along with a bipartisan group of cosponsors, introduced Senate Bill 888 March 7, which would require a criminal conviction before any property is seized, as well as close a loophole that allows local law enforcement to skirt state law by working with the federal government.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u201cBarring state and local law enforcement agencies from passing off cases to the feds is particularly important,\u201d writes Mark Maharrey for the Tenth Amendment Center. \u201cIn several states with strict asset forfeiture laws, prosecutors have done just that. By placing the case under federal jurisdiction, law enforcement can bypass the need for a conviction under state law and collect up to 80 percent of the proceeds from forfeited assets via the federal Equitable Sharing Program.\u201d<\/span>","filename":"5f414f9b897a4f8f8418e17ac694f09a","ext":".jpg","w":623,"h":960,"tn_w":162,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490820731137,"time":1490820731,"md5":"iW0z9Wn46Kpn04uJMIcYSQ==","fsize":187670,"resto":0,"id":"dxOtzuc2","country":"IL","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"in-2014-for-the-first-time-in-recorded-history","country_name":"Israel","replies":21,"images":10,"unique_ips":14},{"no":118834182,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)17:04:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118832814\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118832814<\/a><br>And no one in the world is surprised by this kike faggot&#039;s flag. <br><br>kill.<br><br>your.<br><br>self.<br><br>now","time":1490821475,"resto":118832814,"id":"MdZvYecq","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118834263,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)17:05:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118832814\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118832814<\/a><br>Cultural Revolution\/ China\/ 30 to 90 million starved, worked to death and or cannibalized.

Why is Capitalism in the United States supposed to repair the laughable economy of Venezuela? Did the Soviet Union repair Chile?

Are you saying that buying cheap goods in a third world shithole and selling them for tons elsewhere is a good thing? You are correct of course, but I&#039;m sorry--that is literally a contradiction of your own ideology. That is exploitation, period. It is the definition of Marx&#039;s (creationist-tier retarded) theory of capitalist exploitation. In fact, all that this &quot;economic warfare&quot; has proven is that Marx was even more wrong than the rational price signalling theory that replaced his flat-earth nonsense Labour Theory of Value did. Socialist societies exist by leeching off of free markets. Global Socialism is impossible--Global Capitalism merely does not exist at this moment.","filename":"627","ext":".png","w":1008,"h":672,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1490822058702,"time":1490822058,"md5":"sXKNdmaExZtDHQXxNvbcLA==","fsize":922432,"resto":118832814,"id":"FRJEsUPL","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118836145,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)17:23:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118835040\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118835040<\/a><br>He wouldn&#039;t need to lie, because he never wrote that shit.<br><br><a href=\"#p118834764\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118834764<\/a><br>I hope you&#039;re ready to read Russian, because the sources are all in Russian","time":1490822584,"resto":118832814,"id":"PSyO\/rG2","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":118836201,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)17:23:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118835251\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118835251<\/a><br>The difference between communism and capitalism is one dictates price by supply\/demand one dictates price as assessed value, In communist Russia they made tractors, thousands more than they needed, to keep the people working, they ended up selling said units $ per pound because they had no value to the world, but still kept making them.

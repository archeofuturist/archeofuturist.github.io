New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio says the artwork, called &quot;Fearless Girl,&quot; has inspired many and &quot;fueled powerful conversations about women in leadership.&quot; The New York Daily News says the statue, which stands on Department of Transportation property, will get a longer-term permit through the department&#039;s art program.

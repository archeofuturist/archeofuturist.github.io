The US economy was at it&#039;s height when taxes were high and the welfare state was expanded (1940s-1960s, 1990s). Democratic Presidents always fix the economy, while Republicans tend to destroy it. This is observable fact. So why do you vote against your own economic interests and ignore reality?<br><br>Pic related was clearly the best candidate in this election. Did you know that he was the preferred candidate of most intellectuals? Bernie Sanders won Harvard and was endorsed by Stephen Hawking, Jon Stewart, Noam Chomsky, Neil Degrasse Tyson, and other geniuses much smarter than you. This proves that left wing economic policies are the best for the people.","filename":"bernie sanders","ext":".jpg","w":830,"h":553,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1491017853374,"time":1491017853,"md5":"zwsXLP1qolZ+2EifXG+MOg==","fsize":65834,"resto":0,"id":"gFGQJ3NQ","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"why-are-you-against-high-taxes-and-socialist","country_name":"United States","replies":11,"images":3,"unique_ips":11},{"no":119139346,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)23:40:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119139085\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119139085<\/a><br>Bernie Sanders will never amount to anything because of his own spinelessness and unwillingness to strike back at those who wrong him.

If I think about it truly, its a mind blindness, its never occurred to &quot;who&quot; other people are, as in &quot;who are they on the inside , what are they feeling &quot; I think the difference between that and sociopathy though, is that I do actually empathise, but I must make these manual considerations to do so. Im sad Im like this, its like a lobotomy, and I keep fixating on issues to the point where Ive secured nothing long term in my life, because I never had a plan in that respect. The idea of building a family, or a career has come late to me, a bit too late infact.<br> I also worked with adults with severe autism, and realised it was a catch-all term for non-verbal people who were enigmas. their range of behaviours had little in common with each other. One talked endlessly, but it was never about anything relative, or even making sense. where as another didn&#039;t speak at all, but could be forced to write, and was very intelligent when he did so, citing his interest was french politics. He died of a massive seizure though, and none of us were ever able to understand what he must have felt like on the inside. Unfortunately I also feel the pandering of women staff and psychology has too much pity, and the austics are relieved of any sense of personal responsibility or character judgement, but believe me, much their behavour came from years of pandering which made them imagine themselves to be the centre of the universe. when they were mad, they thought nothing of punching people in the face, yet somehow never hit anybody that might hit them back, but we had to treat them like they had suddenly had a tragic outburst of uncontrolled illness, and fawn over the behavior afterwards, giving them more attention. I ended up hating them.","time":1490789523,"resto":118754158,"id":"NEpI+jgg","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118779616,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)08:16:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118777519\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118777519<\/a><br>You remind me of me, anon","filename":"1490684169487","ext":".jpg","w":326,"h":326,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490789775610,"time":1490789775,"md5":"nBw35iIIMOULicpJuV0LcQ==","fsize":27218,"resto":118754158,"id":"6w07+F8J","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118779935,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)08:20:12","name":"Clovis","com":"<a href=\"#p118779616\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118779616<\/a><br>there&#039;s lots of us.<br>One day we&#039;ll figure out how to make friends with each other outside of the interwebs.","time":1490790012,"resto":118754158,"id":"U+zhfjdQ","country":"NZ","country_name":"New Zealand"},{"no":118779966,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)08:20:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118778808\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118778808<\/a><br>10\/10","time":1490790038,"resto":118754158,"id":"9dNQe4So","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118780249,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)08:23:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118778808\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118778808<\/a><br>Nice","filename":"1432589553682","ext":".jpg","w":393,"h":375,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":119,"tim":1490790235257,"time":1490790235,"md5":"cDUnu3Q311w2g1P8wQtw\/g==","fsize":100821,"resto":118754158,"id":"8hzXBY8V","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118780525,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)08:26:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118754158\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118754158<\/a><br>You know <br>Those apply to almost every single Child<br>Little kids are retards and savages we have to educate and civilize","time":1490790402,"resto":118754158,"id":"6RKCdra7","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118780893,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)08:30:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118778808\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118778808<\/a><br>You know I don&#039;t know if it is stormfags or people pretending to be stormfags who make these but they are hysterical","time":1490790658,"resto":118754158,"id":"6RKCdra7","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118780922,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)08:31:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118773924\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118773924<\/a><br>that must be strange, my mom was 17","filename":"\u2584\u2588\u2580 \u2588\u25ac\u2588 \u2588 \u2588 \u2588 \u2588 \u2588 \u2588 \u2580\u2588\u2580.png","ext":".jpg","w":377,"h":352,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":116,"tim":1490790682446,"time":1490790682,"md5":"71+\/8qL\/pE1zuZS8BA1EQg==","fsize":54453,"resto":118754158,"id":"FwaTfYR6","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118781047,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)08:32:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118778808\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118778808<\/a>","filename":"1490277716333","ext":".jpg","w":240,"h":173,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":90,"tim":1490790761645,"time":1490790761,"md5":"zcPvjd9coIkE\/TnGxCGqTQ==","fsize":6677,"resto":118754158,"id":"Noo5vV0O","country":"CH","country_name":"Switzerland"},{"no":118781050,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)08:32:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118778808\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118778808<\/a>","filename":"1488826694487m","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":576,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1490790763749,"time":1490790763,"md5":"QcXX7qMmLLRU+zwScd6EIw==","fsize":46558,"resto":118754158,"id":"nfJY6XHH","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118781086,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)08:33:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"i know i have something. mom had me when she was almost 45","time":1490790787,"resto":118754158,"id":"WPhv08Tj","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118781241,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)08:35:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118754158\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118754158<\/a><br>It&#039;s our driving factor.

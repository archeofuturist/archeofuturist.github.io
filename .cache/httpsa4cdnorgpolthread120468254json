There isn&#039;t much incentive to build a ring. One of your links estimated the construction cost of 30 trillion dollars. A satellite launch aboard the falcon costs around 100 million dollars. We&#039;d have to put up 300,000 satellites for this to be cost effective.<br><br>Why am I talking about deserts and satellites? Because that&#039;s the huge bulk of what we use rockets for. If there were extraterrestrial outposts that required a lot of travel, then maybe. If space mining were closer to viable, then maybe. Speaking of asteroid mining, how do you suggest we do that? Do we pull the asteroid into Earth orbit or mine on the asteroid and just bring back what we can carry? Do we have the technology to send a crew on a months long trip outside the Van Allen belts?<br><br>Interesting concept, but I don&#039;t think you&#039;ll be able to convince the entire world to give up 5% of their GDP to move us up a step in the Kardeshov scale","time":1491854558,"resto":120468254,"id":"teaX\/gra","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

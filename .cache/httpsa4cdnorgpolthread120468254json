It would cut our costs of going to orbit from about $2000\/kg to about $1\/kg. There are individual asteroids that have tens of trillions of dollars in materials on them that could be mined. One mission could easily pay for the cost of building the Orbital Ring.<br><br>We could then deploy solar power satellites in orbit above cloud cover and return the power back to the surface with near zero loss by running power transmission cables down the elevator, and sell the power at a profit.<br><br>With increased luminosity in space, enhanced exposure time, and the ability to deliver base loads, solar panels pay for themselves in only 1-2 years while having a 20 year life time.<br><br>In other words, if you put $5 trillion of solar panels into space, you get your $5 trillion back by the end of year two and a $5 trillion income stream each year thereafter.<br><br>In other words, the US could cut everyone&#039;s taxes, both personal and business, income, capital, death, or otherwise, all to 0%, not even cut any benefits or current spending, and pay off the national debt within a decade.","filename":"8451","ext":".jpg","w":125,"h":72,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":72,"tim":1491848485293,"time":1491848485,"md5":"fq3bYtERwA+FVAXZeVa9rg==","fsize":2369,"resto":0,"id":"Jv6B4CPb","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"daily-reminder-that-you-could-be-living-in-a-sci","country_name":"United States","replies":6,"images":1,"unique_ips":4},{"no":120469309,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)14:29:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"Lol","time":1491848971,"resto":120468254,"id":"6agVuIoL","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":120469546,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)14:31:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120469309\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120469309<\/a><br><br>What&#039;s so funny about cheap energy, massive economic growth, solving climate change, and being able to cut taxes to 0?<br><br>Or do you just hate America, girls with big titties, and freedom?","filename":"space","ext":".jpg","w":2560,"h":1600,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":78,"tim":1491849088902,"time":1491849088,"md5":"ZX4ShJHfMWPTJ0qwEP0Rqw==","fsize":616215,"resto":120468254,"id":"Jv6B4CPb","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":120470357,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)14:37:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"Geostationary orbit is approximately 26,000 miles away. This is how high you will have to build the space elevator. <br><br>Even shipping power that far through transmission lines is impossible, unless they are superconducting. Doing a rough calculation, you&#039;ll have roughly 5.5% of your power left after shipping it that far (you lose 1.1% per 100 miles)<br><br>And remember this is super high voltage AC current. So you&#039;ll have to convert all that DC solar energy to AC, then step it up to super high voltages through transformers. Every one of these steps has a huge loss associated with it. And of course you need to step the voltage DOWN again at the bottom.<br><br>It&#039;s not an efficient way to generate electricity.

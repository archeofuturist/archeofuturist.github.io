It was a shit time - but it was the kind of shit time you could have a good time in, it was a universally recognized shit time - from the unemployed to the CEO to the Prime Minister, you couldn&#039;t pretend otherwise.<br><br>But because of that, there was almost a perverse hope that anything could happen. The proto-Thatcherites thought that a commie trade-union lead putsch was just around the corner, the Prime Minister knew the army was ready and waiting to cut his head off, the National Front was seen as something of a genuine threat, Tony Benn wanted to drag Labour left and god knows what was going on on Northern Ireland and America (largely illusory) felt it was on decline against a resurgent (actually pretty stagnant, if flashy.) Soviet Union. From WW3 to repatriation, possibility abounded. <br><br>But nobody (except perhaps a few oldish women who&#039;d lived through the war) would stand up and defend the then-present.<br><br>Nowadays, we&#039;re in a similar situation but we&#039;re all engaged in self-denial. The economy is shit, we&#039;ve got no faith in the future, immigration is too high but there&#039;s no way of getting it down. Nobody seriously believes there&#039;s any alternative path to the one we&#039;re walking on - even talk of WW3 is overblown fantasy. 2008 should&#039;ve been a huge catalyst for some sort of change, instead all it did was re-enforce how powerless we are. Would you prefer neoliberalism that can&#039;t eat a bacon sandwich, neoliberalism that fucks bacon, or neoliberalism with beef cu.. I&#039;ll stop there.<br><br>The 1970s were shit, we&#039;re even worse, people defend the present, and laughably pretend things can get better without radical change. We pretend otherwise, because we&#039;ve got no sense of direction. Things won&#039;t even get &quot;worse&quot; in a big bang, they&#039;ll stagnate forever. So it seems.

The only reason I didn&#039;t was because I came here and realized how bad of a position the white race was in right now. I felt like I had a duty to reproduce and help alleviate the problem so I started lifting and weened myself off gay shit. If I didn&#039;t have to worry about the future of my race I would probably be a faggot but that&#039;s just not an option right now. is this just an example of the bad times creating strong men.","filename":"1490755831907","ext":".jpg","w":350,"h":357,"tn_w":245,"tn_h":249,"tim":1492509890234,"time":1492509890,"md5":"Hs90hS77eumIqUErq+hqNg==","fsize":104419,"resto":0,"id":"nRzmMogB","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"is-anybody-else-here-kind-of-liberal-except-for","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

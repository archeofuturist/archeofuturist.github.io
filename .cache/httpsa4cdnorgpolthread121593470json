They operated in three California Counties: San Diego, Riverside, and San Bernardino.<br><br>In three days, the MPG swept day labor sites, Mexican markets, bus stops, parks, and other outdoor locations. They questioned 11K people. Out of that, they arrested 505 illegal aliens.<br><br>The Mexican Consulate and the (((ACLU))) were alarmed and lobbied George W. Bush&#039;s Department of Homeland Security to stop the sweeps, which they did. The sweeps were too effective.<br><br>If this could be done twice a week in all 21 Border Patrol Sectors, 18K illegal aliens would be arrested PER WEEK. That&#039;s 982K PER YEAR and 3.9 million in 4 years (one Presidential term). In 8 years, that&#039;s 7.8 million. <br><br>Trump - like every other Republican - isn&#039;t trying.","filename":"map_8b","ext":".jpg","w":550,"h":357,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":162,"tim":1492468164868,"time":1492468164,"md5":"C6rM3cCsZ+BFzK5f7WC+Gw==","fsize":64879,"resto":0,"id":"QfWOlsuy","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-story-of-the-mobile-patrol-group","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

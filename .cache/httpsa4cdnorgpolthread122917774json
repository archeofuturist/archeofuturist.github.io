Sometimes when it&#039;s sick drugs can help. It&#039;s a finely tuned, balanced system. Complex feedback and feedforward control circuits are involved. One important circuit is the endocannabinoid system. The endogenous ligands are 2-AG and anandamide. They are mimicked by the phytocannabinoids THC and CBD. When external plant-based cannabinoids are administered they overpower the natural ligands and effectively &#039;turn-off&#039; the brains internal signaling. The brains ability to talk to itself returns when the external THC and CBD wash away, however down-regulation of the CB receptors occurs because of the relatively huge amount of external cannabinoids favored by marijuana users. This results in anxiety, apathy and pain. So a larger amount of plant-based neurotransmitters are administered.

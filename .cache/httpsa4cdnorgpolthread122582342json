Anarchists hold that capitalism and the state are inextricably linked and that to get rid of one you need to get rid of the other, they therefore advocate the immediate abolition of the state and the transferal of power to democratic unions or councils, alonside the abolition of private property, meaning that anarchists support the democratic control of resources by the community. They wish for goods to be produced for need, rather than for profit. <br><br>The abolition of private property is NOT taking away your home, toothbrush or television, the abolition of private property is the abolition of that relationship which allows one to profit from the labour of another, the abolition of the private owner, the usurer the banker, the rentier, the factory owner etc. In place of these, the community will own the housing and provide it rent free, the workers will control the factory democratically and its profits will go to them not the owner, etc. Anarchists make a distinction between personal property (home, television, a thing that you are using and whose value would be depleted were it to be used by somebody else, i.e a home is of no use to you if you might go back and find your bed with somebody else in it) and private property (when you charge another for the use of something you are not using (for example, I have my house, and you work every day to pay me to live in my second or third house). <br><br> Anarchism is distinct from Marxism in that Marxist believe the state should be seized and used to create communism, whereas anarchists believe communism can only be achieved after the abolition of the state, though there are libertarian Marxists who have considerable overlap with anarchism, the council communists and autonomists etc.","filename":"Bakunin","ext":".png","w":220,"h":279,"tn_w":197,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493038320804,"time":1493038320,"md5":"WgmghVSzrsyAbh+v+Cf6VQ==","fsize":99896,"resto":0,"id":"UwvSLU2y","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"leftypol-here","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":56,"images":6,"unique_ips":27},{"no":122582393,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)08:52:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122582342\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122582342<\/a><br>Anarchist Societies have existed in Spain (George Orwell fought alongisde anarchists here) Ukraine, (Nestor Mahknos army successfully defeated the Ukrainian ruling class only to be betrayed by the USSR) Chiapas, and Rojava (Currently fighting ISIS). <br><br> The fundamental anarchist belief is that the people should be in control of their own destiny. Ultimately, whatever happens to the community is decided directly by the community and none in that community have any special status so that their input or power can corrupt the willl of the community. <br><br> Anarchism goes beyond nationalism. Nationalism seeks to unite man behind the nation, but man has never lived with his nation, man has always lived with his community, his family, his colleugues, his friends, the people who provide him services, these are the people man shares bonds of trust with, this are the people man shares culture with. Anarchism seeks to unite man where capitalism has pushed him apart from his fellows, anarchism is pro community and pro community not by entrusting the fate of the community in the hands of a centralised state, but by putting the community in the direct control of the people. <br><br> Throughout history anarchist regions have been far less violent than their capitalist, socialist or facist neighbours, notwithstanding that yes, like every system, they have comitted some violence. Crucially, none of the main Anarchist regions in history collapsed from within, they all went from strength to strength until crushed by much larger enemies, (i.e the USSR or Franco\/Germany\/Italy)","time":1493038351,"resto":122582342,"id":"UwvSLU2y","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122582434,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)08:53:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122582393\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122582393<\/a><br>Key thinkers: <br><br> https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Pierr<wbr>e-Joseph_Proudhon <br><br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Peter<wbr>_Kropotkin <br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mikha<wbr>il_Bakunin <br><br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Murra<wbr>y_Bookchin <br><br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/David<wbr>_Graeber<br><br>(his book, Debt: The First 5000 Years, is in my opinion the most imporant book of the last 500 years, describing in detail the world debt economy and its history) <br><br><br> I come here in good faith, I don&#039;t aim to be a smug liberal, I aim to teach about the historical position of anarchism, I believe it is much unnotticed by pol, but shares many similar beliefs with pol, most notably hatred of Bankers (which even at points runs into hatred of jews, Bakunin and Proudhon in particular) and a love of strong community.

You may order what anybody else may order. In that way, the entirety of your labour is returned to you, as you have as much democratic power in this community as anybody else. Furthermore, consider this a community where you are catered for even if you do not work, your hard work is at your own free will, if you choose to produce more that is up to you and will benefit the community if you do. <br><br> The anarchist position (and I believe it to be true) is that most people enjoy work. Most people want to build something, to be part of society and contribute, to help each other with things, the problem is that we are unable to do this because of various barriers, the largest being that we spend the greatest proportion of our time working for the private capitalist, meaning all our labour ours serve him and not ourselves. Working hours need not be as long as they are or as strenuous for us to fill our desires, much less work would be required of you in an anarchist society, so anything you did beyond that would be of your own free will, if you wanted to pursue something academic for example, you could do that for free, if you had an invention, you could pitch it to the community and they could decide if it was good enough to produce or not, just like a businesses. I realise I&#039;m rambling but basically are the motivations for work would change, you would no longer be working just to aimlessly produce as much as possible,but working as a community to a tangible goal","time":1493040385,"resto":122582342,"id":"UwvSLU2y","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122585294,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)09:26:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122585044\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122585044<\/a><br><br>What if me and my 200 friends get guns and shoot everyone who tries to get through our fence?","time":1493040390,"resto":122582342,"id":"CQo8caaI","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122585374,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)09:27:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122583884\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122583884<\/a><br>No bosses isn&#039;t just about management, its about the massive surplus of labour value that is siphoned into cocaine and child prostitutes instead of education","time":1493040446,"resto":122582342,"id":"UwvSLU2y","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122585426,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)09:28:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122584421\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122584421<\/a><br>read the whole post, read that book at the end DEBT:THE FIRST 5000 Years.

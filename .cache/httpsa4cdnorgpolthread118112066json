Because a stray dog chose to give birth near her front door, a woman decided to punish her by killing all eight of her puppies, right in front of her eyes.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The owner of the house did not appreciate the presence of this mother stray and her puppies in a gutter by her front door. And mercilessly, she killed them all one by one in front of their mother, who was powerless to stop her.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Thrown against rocks, the newborns did not survive. The morbid scene was discovered by her neighbours, who said so much damage had been done that some of the puppies intestines were strewn across the rocks.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The local residents were completely horrified and told the IndiaTimes that the female dog kept trying to \u201cwake them up, running around us asking for help, trying to show us.\u201d<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The perpetrator of this heinous crime does not seem to regret her actions. She wanted to teach the stray dog a lesson so that she didn\u2019t come back to her house. An outraged neighbour recounted:<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;When we asked her how she could kill innocent puppies, and that she had no right to do that, she said she wanted to teach the mother a lesson so that she doesn\u2019t litter or come near her house again.<\/span>","filename":"Dog","ext":".jpg","w":400,"h":267,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1490380849885,"time":1490380849,"md5":"Hut+CXd2rCO3km0GXxogJQ==","fsize":55891,"resto":0,"id":"FLY\/m5fL","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-town-of-krishnanagar-in-india-is-in-a-state","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

In total, 3158 Americans have died from terrorist attacks in the last twenty years, 2902 of them occurring as a result of 9\/11. That averages out to be 158 a year<br><br>Approximately 69 million people are enrolled in medicaid. If you were to reduce that by even 10%, you would be removing medical care from 6.9 million people. There are hundreds of diseases that could kill people, but let&#039;s keep it simple and only look at type 1 diabetes.<br><br>Type 1 diabetes is fatal unless treated, however it&#039;s an easily treated disease. It effects about 0.4% of the population. So, if you were to reduce medicaid access by 10%, approximately 27,000 type 1 diabetics would no longer have access to medical care. If even 1% of those people were to die annually, an extremely low estimate, that would be 270 people dying, 1.7x more than by terrorism.<br><br>And that is just one disease.<br><br>So yeah, crazy Christians might not cause terrorist attacks, but by supporting someone who wants to reduce medical access for Americans, they may as well be.<br>How will republicans save this? Why are they so intent on us spending so much more in taxes on healthcare? If we had a single payer system we wouldn&#039;t have to bail out the poor who are on deaths door and cost us tens of thousands.","filename":"20170330_120915","ext":".png","w":500,"h":501,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491679737436,"time":1491679737,"md5":"Ya173Gkx2XoX1kwht6qW1Q==","fsize":271252,"resto":0,"id":"q\/yNY1M1","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"healthcare","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":2,"unique_ips":3},{"no":120171866,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)15:34:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;you need communism or people will die<\/span><br>if you want a service, you&#039;ll need to pay for it schlomo","filename":"capitalism","ext":".png","w":625,"h":195,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":39,"tim":1491680097557,"time":1491680097,"md5":"jFKDoLuIo7BWhdkrNVF5kg==","fsize":8582,"resto":120171056,"id":"IKwTzYgc","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120171908,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)15:35:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120171056\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120171056<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;dead Amerifats <\/span><br>Good.

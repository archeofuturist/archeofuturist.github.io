The chain of custody is sound, the story doesn&#039;t change over time.<br>2. There was stuff in the Bible that was later confirmed by archeology(places, people, etc.)<br>3. There are even non-believers&#039; accounts of some stuff Jesus did, just from them you can know a lot about Jesus if you piece it all together.<br>4. The differences between gospels aren&#039;t a bad sign, because witnesses rarely agree on stuff. If every eyewitness would say the same thing, it would be very fishy and would mean they probably talked to each other at one point.<br>5. The apostles died without getting rich, getting a girlfriend or getting power, they all died horribly. There was no point in spreading Christianity if they didn&#039;t believe in it. Why would they risk their life if it wasn&#039;t true? Why would they risk their life if it was all forged? Why would Paul try to join this new small church?<br>Also the only accounts of Romans getting Christians to change their faith was after the 1st century. No account of eyewitnesses ever changing their story.","time":1490981859,"resto":119076654,"id":"aN\/rwYOy","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":119078124,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)13:38:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119077400\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119077400<\/a><br>Bingo.","time":1490981899,"resto":119076654,"id":"1UBnjoKj","country":"CO","country_name":"Colombia"},{"no":119078134,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)13:38:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119078054\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119078054<\/a><br><br><a href=\"#p119078058\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119078058<\/a><br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/List_<wbr>of_Christian_Nobel_laureates<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;According to 100 Years of Nobel Prize (2005), a review of Nobel prizes awarded between 1901 and 2000, 65.4% of Nobel Prize Laureates, have identified Christianity in its various forms as their religious preference (423 prizes).[5] Overall, Christians have won a total of 78.3% of all the Nobel Prizes in Peace, 72.5% in Chemistry, 65.3% in Physics, 62% in Medicine, 54% in Economics and 49.5% of all Literature awards.[6]<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The three primary divisions of Christianity are Catholicism, Eastern Orthodoxy, and Protestantism.

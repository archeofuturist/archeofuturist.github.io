He is somehow related to France and will save them from destruction in a Great War. He is supposed to become the last Roman Emperor and will rule a kingdom as great as it. He will be like David in the fact that he is after God&#039;s own heart. This might have something to do with the ring and rod part of the pol prophecy (no idea if that&#039;s real or not).","filename":"image","ext":".jpg","w":1920,"h":1080,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1491885805029,"time":1491885805,"md5":"XoM1a98\/zysOZ1LVneFs8A==","fsize":379647,"resto":0,"id":"VDGfp4hO","country":"CA","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"great-catholic-king","country_name":"Canada","replies":65,"images":8,"unique_ips":23},{"no":120554507,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)00:45:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"Profile of the supposed King:<br>This man will have a relationship with God so deep that it will cause him constant grief in modern society. He will have intimacy issues and suicidal tendencies. He will have trouble connecting with people and have a constant sense of being misunderstood. He most likely will be shy and suffer from loneliness. He will be profoundly penitential. He will have much difficulty finding guidance in his life. His views being contrary to modern thought will place him at a severe risk for being labeled as mentally ill. He will have trust issues that leave him in a constant state of dread and fear. Most likely he will flee the world either to the wilderness or to a Monastic community. He will feel that the worlds problems are his own, and may become disillusioned. He will struggle with activities of daily living, and suffer from depression and isolation. He will have difficulty finding a realistic support structure, and will encounter much hostility in regards to his mystical nature. He will be altruistic and have a deep respect for the lowly of this world. At some point in his life he will have a major identity crisis, that threatens his whole sense of existence, self esteem, self worth, and his place in the world. He will be traumatized by the force of human resistance to God&#039;s Will. He will have anger issues and feel conflicted about war, violence, justice, and mercy. He will be hyper-intelligent and a searcher. There is a High Possibility that he will disbelieve in himself and his own capabilities. He will not be fond of technology or technological advances. He will prefer rural living to urban environments and will be a minimalist. It is not improbable that he will suffer from paranoia, disassociation or lose his sense of reality all together. He will live with great confusion in his heart.","time":1491885915,"resto":120554288,"id":"VDGfp4hO","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120555017,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)00:49:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120554288\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120554288<\/a><br>I&#039;m not ready yet.","time":1491886182,"resto":120554288,"id":"bNKCrGwk","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120555128,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)00:50:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120554288\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120554288<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; This might have something to do with the ring and rod part of the pol prophecy<\/span><br><br>Well...<br><br>Clash of Ring and Rod is an old sumerian metaphore for &quot;Tribulation&quot;.","time":1491886241,"resto":120554288,"id":"iQpzONwm","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":120555147,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)00:50:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120555017\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120555017<\/a><br>Top Kek.","time":1491886246,"resto":120554288,"id":"VDGfp4hO","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120555226,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)00:51:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120554507\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120554507<\/a><br>What bait!

All i know so far is he will come from France, the House of Lillies, will have a limp, and will be a very strong warrior. He led a life of great sin before he did his penance. He is the last survivor of the royal bloodline of King Louis. And, of course, is Catholic. I am still researching. I do not know if he has exposed himself yet.","time":1491888464,"resto":120554288,"id":"5zFC9pPy","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120559230,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)01:29:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120558788\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120558788<\/a><br>Close, but no cigar.<br><br>What he said: <a href=\"#p120559078\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120559078<\/a><br>Numerology is very frowned upon by God.","time":1491888548,"resto":120554288,"id":"5zFC9pPy","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120559414,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)01:31:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120555735\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120555735<\/a><br>Alot of pol users are making their Catholic confirmation soon and joining the knights of Columbus next.","time":1491888664,"resto":120554288,"id":"RrGDp+n1","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120559509,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)01:31:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120556791\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120556791<\/a><br><a href=\"#p120557037\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120557037<\/a><br>No proof King Arthur was &quot;just a myth.&quot; And remember, it was originally told by a French author.

A series of laws were instituted to encourage early marriage and frequent childbirth. Lex Julia (18 BC) and the Lex Papia Poppaea (AD 9) are two well known examples of such laws, which among others, provided tax breaks and preferential treatment when applying for public office for those that complied with the laws. Severe limitations were imposed on those who did not. For example, the surviving spouse of a childless couple could only inherit one-tenth of the deceased fortune, while the rest was taken by the state. These laws encountered resistance from the population which led to the disregard of their provisions and to their eventual abolition.[3]<\/span><br><br>We should totally confiscate the inheritance of childless couples, especially if they&#039;re faggots.","filename":"Augustus","ext":".jpg","w":187,"h":269,"tn_w":173,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492332840564,"time":1492332840,"md5":"4DHJaytpxfl1ZmHD36j8Ow==","fsize":5557,"resto":0,"id":"L\/mseckl","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"ancient-rome-especially-in-the-time-of-augustus","country_name":"Canada","replies":1,"images":1,"unique_ips":2},{"no":121338827,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)04:59:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121338428\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121338428<\/a>","filename":"FaceApp_1492140831263","ext":".jpg","w":200,"h":200,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492333172860,"time":1492333172,"md5":"RMzuOU4xZjKhF2K+eSFTJQ==","fsize":27830,"resto":121338428,"id":"aEhRHChG","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]}

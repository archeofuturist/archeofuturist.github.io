He admitted it to his lawyer (See &quot;Waco: The Rules of Engagement&quot;) However, it has never been proven whether or not those weapons were on the property before or after the initial raid. It&#039;s entirely possible that Koresh decided to convert his perfectly legal firearms to automatic fire AFTER the ATF shot up his home. Basically, to match their firepower.<br><br>2) Allegations of child abuse: No actual evidence has ever been presented that Koresh (or any other Davidians) abused children, sexually or otherwise. However, if the testimony of faithful survivors is to be believed, then Koresh DID have sex with at least one girl under the age of 14. David Thibodeau and Clive Doyle (both of whom escaped from the building on April 19th, 1993, and harbor no ill will towards Koresh) have admitted that their leader did have sexual relations with an underage girl in their commune.<br><br>3) The fire: Most likely started by either the FBI pyrotechnic devices (which the government denied were used until a bumbling documentary filmmaker found them in the evidence room) or the FBI tank knocking over a lantern in the southeast corner of the building. FLIR footage seems to indicate the latter. One survivor, a man named Jamie Castillo, was alleged to have admitted to Ron Cole that Koresh started the fire. Cole (a convicted felon who has a history of making outrageous statements, and once claimed in the 90s that he knew Osama Bin Laden) made this claim after Castillo died. Researcher Carol Moore has stated that she doubts Castillo did anything other than raise the possibility.","filename":"1101930503_400","ext":".jpg","w":400,"h":527,"tn_w":94,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491966318300,"time":1491966318,"md5":"n0xMT3NoWTbJq1o5CMgQRw==","fsize":39254,"resto":120701384,"id":"XiSVCTrC","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120704106,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)23:05:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120703910\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120703910<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;But my hate for heretics is way higher than my hate for US governmental agencies.<\/span><br>Who do you think runs the country?","filename":"041116sick","ext":".jpg","w":800,"h":420,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":65,"tim":1491966337880,"time":1491966337,"md5":"pVcEUnj0F6u5YjkKrBHDJQ==","fsize":60153,"resto":120701384,"id":"EuZXnTxd","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120704187,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)23:06:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120704071\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120704071<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;1) Illegal weapons: Yes, Koresh had some.<\/span><br>SHALL<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;2) Allegations of child abuse<\/span><br>Not a federal crime","time":1491966381,"resto":120701384,"id":"EuZXnTxd","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120704345,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)23:07:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120704106\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120704106<\/a><br>P-please stop scaring me Anon, it&#039;s almost bedtime.","time":1491966461,"resto":120701384,"id":"uoPjf2A1","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":120704416,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)23:08:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120704345\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120704345<\/a><br><br>It&#039;s okay anon, I&#039;ve eaten more pain than they can ever know.","time":1491966490,"resto":120701384,"id":"unW7Ow2E","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120704481,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)23:08:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120703910\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120703910<\/a><br>If I remember correctly this was the same year the FBI used a sharp shooter to gun down Randy Weavers wife and infant child in her arms.","time":1491966527,"resto":120701384,"id":"dx7NxZMq","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120704592,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)23:09:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120704187\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120704187<\/a><br><a href=\"#p120704187\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120704187<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;SHALL<\/span><br>I personally don&#039;t give a shit what weapons he possessed.

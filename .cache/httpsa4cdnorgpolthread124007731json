Morale is a lot more than on a literal battlefield; it&#039;s the will to remain in conflict for one&#039;s ideas and if one loses the ability to identify with that idea, it becomes more likely that individual will abandon it all together.

Sun Tzu even states in the Art of War that killing isn&#039;t natural; men need to be driven to great anger or goaded with great rewards in order to fuel unrestrained violence. Makes sense from a survival standpoint as well- common sense dictates that there&#039;s significantly more hitting in fights than there is out of them, so prioritizing survival would mean focusing on EITHER avoiding fights or diving into them and being rather fucking good at it.

The TARP bailout in &#039;09 is proof that high finance rules America like a Fuedal state. However, that doesn&#039;t mean that government can run anything worth a shit. True capitalism, where currency isn&#039;t massively inflated year over year and the elites don&#039;t replace the people which cheap brown slave labor, was the way forward for this country. Our politicians sold us out a long time ago - the nation is doomed.","time":1493872498,"resto":124007731,"id":"P0HXV8qM","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124018974,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)00:35:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"No one is desperate enough to fight a civil war in America, everyone is too comfortable","time":1493872517,"resto":124007731,"id":"zdslaQH0","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124019015,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)00:35:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124018534\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124018534<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;All liberals are not a monolith<\/span><br>You dont fuckin say?<br>Now how about applying some of that stellar reasoning when dealing with your political opponents","time":1493872546,"resto":124007731,"id":"9epijg3A","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124019045,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)00:36:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124007731\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124007731<\/a><br>The only way you will ever be free, is by getting rid of the Jews.<br><br>Now how you accomplish that is your thing.","time":1493872561,"resto":124007731,"id":"7uMAlI6x","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":124019162,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)00:37:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124017152\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124017152<\/a><br><a href=\"#p124018001\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124018001<\/a><br><br>Socialism, wealth distribution, is similar to slavery how the owners (people in power\/connections, see Venezuela) stay wealthy for nothing off of the working class.

This will increase the moral and cultural divide even further. Last time this cultural\/moral divide happened was when the democrats were for the expansion of slavery.<br><br>And violence? They wouldn\u2019t even need to use violence. They could use their power to aid or lead their \u201cresistance\u201d. Is the mayor of berkeley telling cops to stand down an example of this? Poll workers turning the other way? <br><br>Maddow and other people in media who agree, they could help out by reporting false information or not covering stories. So-called celebrity scientists will justify your violence because \u201cyou are saving the world.\u201d Normies may not fight, but in democrat areas, they will be sympathetic to their so-called \u201crighteous\u201d cause.<br><br>They seem to be in constant panicked and offended mode. It\u2019s their war of micro-aggression. Which sounds way too similar to what the democrats called their last one.","filename":"abe_pepe","ext":".png","w":800,"h":600,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1493866549814,"time":1493866549,"md5":"VRTir7jh3k+sujBbIUwLqQ==","fsize":277111,"resto":0,"id":"VZpJBerw","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"are-we-heading-towards-civil-war","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

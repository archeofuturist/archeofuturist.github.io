However, I will grant that he wrote \u201cthe bourgeois private property\u201d which indicates the specificity of this abolishment. This is an issue, at least to the liberal principle of private property rights, for two reasons. The first is that the Bourgeoisie are still humans and therefore have inherent natural right to own that property, whether it is landed or not. No man who is not the owner himself of some piece of private property like a farm, building, or piece of land, has a right to the private property of the owner. <br><br>The second reason is that the implementation of this Marxist principle simply cannot work without either capitulation or government intervention, both of which will create enemies for Marxists. Through the capitulation of the owner, and rightly so by human right, the former owner retains a legitimate claim on the property and, depending on the nature of the man, can take action at a later time. In a land like America, with a multitude of private property owners, the Marxists will see our nation drowned in blood before they can accomplish their goals. Through government intervention they make enemies not only of the owners, but also the entirety of the people of the nation. Not only do the owners lose their property to the collective of Marxists, those who had wanted to one day come to own private property would have their hopes, as well as their natural right to property, crushed by the government. <br><br>Of course, this is only the immediate effect. What is left is a government that has a precedent of taking from its own citizens and the thus the first motion towards centralization of government.","time":1492835112,"resto":122234130,"id":"oJIElfiy","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122235261,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)00:25:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122235229\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122235229<\/a><br>John Locke in his Second Treatise of Government makes a great analogy with a slave ship that is headed towards Algeria.

When so much power is centralized in government it leads to an obvious and harsh tyranny. Under a system of Communism, it would come in an even deadlier and subtler form: the Soft Despotism of Tocqueville which he describes in great work Democracy In America. <br><br>This would be the, what he called, \u201cinfantilization\u201d of the populace who rely solely on this new centralized power for all of man\u2019s needs and desires. The worst part is that all of that which has made us human is completely gone in these people under Soft Despotism. The desire for anything has been replaced with something else: hate for the oppressor. In the person\u2019s mind, this is the most important possible to think about and they attempt to exert much of their mental energy on it. This is how the last of our humanity is transferred to this new government. They would desire to spend more and more of their energies fixated on this hate and would not just give up, but gladly and enthusiastically give it up to the government so that they need not worry about it since they have more \u201cimportant\u201d things to think about. <br><br>One of, if not the most pressing, issue with any kind of despotism, whether it be soft or harsh, is the crushing of freedom of speech and thought. Marx\u2019s vision of the collectivization of humanity has no sympathy for dissenting opinion. Freedom of Expression is a pillar of Western culture and civilization.","time":1492835204,"resto":122234130,"id":"oJIElfiy","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122235378,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)00:26:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122234130\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122234130<\/a><br><br> P H Y S I C A L<br>R E M O V A L","time":1492835210,"resto":122234130,"id":"EKRSt9gZ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122235447,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)00:27:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122235367\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122235367<\/a><br>Although John Stuart Mill in On Liberty goes into much more detail than I will, he makes a utilitarian argument for Freedom of Expression. What Marx does not consider is that without the marketplace of ideas and constant rational discussion of a variety of topics, his ideas will likely wither and die at the first sign of any kind of resistance in the future (albeit, at least with the Soviets these were likely suppressed and promptly shot). Mill describes the downsides of suppressing freedom of expression with three main points: first, the opinion expressed may possibly be true and it would be lost to society, to deny this would be to assume that we as humans are infallible which simply is not the case; second, even if the opinion is wrong it may contain a portion of the truth, and usually prevailing opinions (in this case Communism) do not contain the entire truth, this kernel of truth can only be obtained through rational discussion and debate which the Soft Despotic state would have abolished; and thirdly, even if Communism was the whole truth it would end up being held in a matter of prejudice, much like how many Christians today hold Christianity in prejudice without understanding the theological background of it (or even opening the Bible at all), this leads to the meaning of the doctrine of Communism being lost and deprived of its effect on its followers, becoming mere dogma and preventing the growth of any real heartfelt conviction for it. <br><br>The twentieth century has been the proving ground for Communism and in all places it has failed, but that is not all; in all places it has been tried it was almost always totalitarian and repressive. Thus, is the nature of Communism and Marxism and their tendencies towards centralization of power.","filename":"John Stuart Mill","ext":".jpg","w":769,"h":991,"tn_w":96,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492835252093,"time":1492835252,"md5":"Vz9GpG7xiCq9AkkwuEaUMQ==","fsize":95720,"resto":122234130,"id":"oJIElfiy","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122235496,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)00:28:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122235447\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122235447<\/a><br>Not being a social psychologist, I can\u2019t say much on this issue of mine, but it certainly does not feel right.

This victim complex of Marxist\u2019s seems irreconcilable with any sort of rational thought and with Marx\u2019s rhetoric of the Bourgeoisie, he does not seem to even consider them human. Though to the Marxist, they are oppressors, the Marxist should see that even these so-called oppressors are still human and thus ought to be afforded human rights. This makes perfect sense what with the almost constant violation of human rights in Communist countries throughout the twentieth century.","filename":"Karl Marx","ext":".jpg","w":1200,"h":1721,"tn_w":87,"tn_h":124,"tim":1492835284230,"time":1492835284,"md5":"zKRHVzyM+7RYR\/rRAnJYJg==","fsize":440788,"resto":122234130,"id":"oJIElfiy","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":122235541,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)00:28:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122235496\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122235496<\/a><br>The overarching issue and probably most arguable, is the idea that Marxism and Communism seem not only like a departure from normal Western ideals, but a departure from humanity itself. In Marx\u2019s On the Jewish Question, he speaks of liberalism and its success of making humanity freer, but he then says that it is not radical enough and that it does not go far enough. He first talks about the liberalism\u2019s success of removing religion from politics, but then scolds it for merely privatizing it. Marx talks about how there are two spheres to life: the political\/public sphere and the private sphere; the private sphere is the \u201creal\u201d life of a man. He does not like religion since it keeps the worker looking to the heavens and an afterlife of peace rather than focusing on his conditions here on Earth. For this reason, he says liberalism needed wipe religion away completely so that man could look at his current condition and join the Communist revolution. His disdain for private property also comes through while he talks about things liberalism was not radical enough about. His issue with the liberal government is that it not only defends private property and freedom of religion, but it upholds them as things that ought to be defended and among the purposes that government even exists in the first place.","filename":"Alexis de Tocqueville","ext":".jpg","w":1031,"h":1382,"tn_w":93,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492835310559,"time":1492835310,"md5":"BIqUh83LZ6scIM58zU1x8w==","fsize":161352,"resto":122234130,"id":"oJIElfiy","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":122235660,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)00:29:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122235541\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122235541<\/a><br>I just realized I didn&#039;t quite finish it.

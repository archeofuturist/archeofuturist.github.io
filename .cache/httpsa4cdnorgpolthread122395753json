And Spencer isn&#039;t the guy advocating interventionist foreign policy where we indiscriminately bomb thousands of foreign people. That&#039;s the establishment, including most of the &quot;Democrats&quot; we&#039;ve elected. It just seems weird to celebrate this so much. People like Richard Spencer are so fringe and inconsequential and the &quot;punch&quot; was so meaningless. I hate when people argue like this in real life (or on the internet), you&#039;ll say something and they&#039;ll respond with &quot;oh you&#039;re just mad that X Y Z 1 2 3,&quot; because they have no actual response to what you said. We should hold ourselves to a higher standard, this kind of shit is just too dumb for me. It&#039;s like Trump has given us permission to act like retarded children like he does","filename":"Screen Shot 2017-04-23 at 3.14.47 AM","ext":".png","w":572,"h":563,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":246,"tim":1492932508978,"time":1492932508,"md5":"M\/DpKw2nXN\/pmGrm\/5QyvQ==","fsize":339966,"resto":0,"id":"10XbIeER","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"shitlib-cultural-marxist-commie-here-its-kind-of","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

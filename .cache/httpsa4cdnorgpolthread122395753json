And Spencer isn&#039;t the guy advocating interventionist foreign policy where we indiscriminately bomb thousands of foreign people. That&#039;s the establishment, including most of the &quot;Democrats&quot; we&#039;ve elected. It just seems weird to celebrate this so much. People like Richard Spencer are so fringe and inconsequential and the &quot;punch&quot; was so meaningless. I hate when people argue like this in real life (or on the internet), you&#039;ll say something and they&#039;ll respond with &quot;oh you&#039;re just mad that X Y Z 1 2 3,&quot; because they have no actual response to what you said.

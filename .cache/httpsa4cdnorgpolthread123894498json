For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good, Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God; Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away. For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts, Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth. Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also resist the truth: men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith.

Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution. But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving, and being deceived. But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned them; And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus. All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness: That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works.<\/span><br>2 Timothy 3","filename":"20170502_162058","ext":".jpg","w":856,"h":912,"tn_w":117,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493806011548,"time":1493806011,"md5":"Vhx1C5QrvErmpInfdRxsCA==","fsize":441151,"resto":123894498,"id":"h4r\/SJ94","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123897086,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)06:06:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123896545\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123896545<\/a><br>I didn&#039;t see any thing wrong with it, only the normies got upset, and that means you need to go back","time":1493806017,"resto":123894498,"id":"iT4HFZIX","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":123897115,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)06:07:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123895423\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123895423<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;save the world from the evil of science<\/span><br><br>Is that false narrative still going around?","time":1493806049,"resto":123894498,"id":"pUkn3wfW","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123897465,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)06:13:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123896863\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123896863<\/a><br>I currently live in a place in Alaska that translates to &quot;Wrong Way Home&quot;, I think it&#039;d be a step up for me.","time":1493806407,"resto":123894498,"id":"a79PAG7w","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123897538,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)06:14:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"HAPPENING<br><br><a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/123895640#p123895640\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123895640<\/a><br><br><a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/123895640#p123895640\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123895640<\/a><br><br><a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/123895640#p123895640\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123895640<\/a>","time":1493806479,"resto":123894498,"id":"aTwWDS\/r","country":"LU","country_name":"Luxembourg"}]}

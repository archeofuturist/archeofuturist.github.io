For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts, Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.

Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution. But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving, and being deceived. But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned them; And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus. All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness: That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works.<\/span><br>2 Timothy 3","filename":"20170502_162058","ext":".jpg","w":856,"h":912,"tn_w":117,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493806011548,"time":1493806011,"md5":"Vhx1C5QrvErmpInfdRxsCA==","fsize":441151,"resto":123894498,"id":"h4r\/SJ94","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123897086,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)06:06:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123896545\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123896545<\/a><br>I didn&#039;t see any thing wrong with it, only the normies got upset, and that means you need to go back","time":1493806017,"resto":123894498,"id":"iT4HFZIX","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":123897115,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)06:07:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123895423\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123895423<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;save the world from the evil of science<\/span><br><br>Is that false narrative still going around?","time":1493806049,"resto":123894498,"id":"pUkn3wfW","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123897465,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)06:13:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123896863\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123896863<\/a><br>I currently live in a place in Alaska that translates to &quot;Wrong Way Home&quot;, I think it&#039;d be a step up for me.","time":1493806407,"resto":123894498,"id":"a79PAG7w","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123897538,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)06:14:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"HAPPENING<br><br><a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/123895640#p123895640\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123895640<\/a><br><br><a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/123895640#p123895640\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123895640<\/a><br><br><a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/123895640#p123895640\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123895640<\/a>","time":1493806479,"resto":123894498,"id":"aTwWDS\/r","country":"LU","country_name":"Luxembourg"},{"no":123897620,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)06:16:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123895751\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123895751<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;that nose<\/span><br>Oy vey","time":1493806561,"resto":123894498,"id":"eJ1+lbR8","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123897682,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)06:17:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"Shit is as wierd as it&#039;s always been. <br>People just notice more as they get older before deciding to forget again.","time":1493806625,"resto":123894498,"id":"tsbjwSH5","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123897689,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)06:17:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123894498\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123894498<\/a><br>exaggerated headline<br><br>antifa will throw whatever you hand to them (if it&#039;s not valuable enough to keep i guess)<br><br>people were giving them cans of pepsi as a joke","time":1493806630,"resto":123894498,"id":"wgz\/zObX","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":123897703,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)06:17:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123897465\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123897465<\/a><br>Definitely do it, in that case. <br>I&#039;m a spoiled big city faggot and i&#039;m jaded and just talkking trash, it&#039;s actually a cool area.","time":1493806641,"resto":123894498,"id":"Iszc9RxJ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123897880,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)06:20:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"The timeline is shifting at levels that shouldn&#039;t even be possible","time":1493806812,"resto":123894498,"id":"dX0ETSVI","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123897950,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)06:21:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123894498\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123894498<\/a><br><br>Riot police and their cucked controllers put up with too much<br><br>Any solid object thrown should be met with lethal force<br><br>The &quot;protestors&quot;

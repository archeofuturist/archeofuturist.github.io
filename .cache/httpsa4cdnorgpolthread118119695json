I remember when i wa in high school and my AP psych teacher was talking about eugenics like it was the worst thing to ever happen and a giant stain on american history...fast forward 5 years...it really seems like common sense and i dont know why you wouldnt control the flow of genetics. We do it with everything else; selectively breeding plants and animals to produce desired qualities, why wouldnt we do it with ourselves?","filename":"eugenics","ext":".jpg","w":756,"h":596,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":197,"tim":1490384623849,"time":1490384623,"md5":"mVdNbPGj+SacLCD04c5Bgg==","fsize":142842,"resto":0,"id":"zx5F6ECI","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"how-old-were-you-when-you-realized-eugenics-was-a","country_name":"United States","replies":3,"images":0,"unique_ips":4},{"no":118120288,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)15:47:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118119695\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118119695<\/a><br>Because &quot;muh individual freedom to make loads of retarded babies&quot;<br>I really hope humanity will adopt Eugenism asap it is very needed today with the worldwide lowering of IQ scores and increase in transexuality\/homosexuality and all this garbage","time":1490384860,"resto":118119695,"id":"NmRwvm32","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":118120728,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)15:50:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"17, when I first realized I was ugly. <br><br>Who the fuck wants to be born ugly, lame, or stupid? <br><br>Nobody, so we should enact policies that weed those out.","time":1490385042,"resto":118119695,"id":"gVAmH5JQ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118121188,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)15:54:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"I was 18 I think and my thought about it may sound quite retarded, but here it is: I was a conservative nationalist at the time already, and I had that ideal picture of the 4 children-family in my mind. But then I thought that the population would explode if everyone would pursue that ideal. So I came up with: Well then not everyone should be allowed to breed. And that&#039;s how I became an eugenicist. But I should say that my thoughts on the subject became far more elaborate with time.

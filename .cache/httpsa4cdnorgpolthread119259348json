You&#039;re consciously mixing people in risky positions such as construction (and mind you, general laborers on average don&#039;t plan yo STAY unskilled, that&#039;s why they do apprenticeships on site, and no, construction workers aren&#039;t unskilled jobs) with an unskilled position such as a busboy. <br><br>It&#039;s not equivalent, and you just use it to drive an emotional argument, to make unskilled laborers look like the martyrs that they&#039;re not.

The DOD calculates Aircraft Operating and support costs as listed in this document If you read into it what you see is that the government quantifies this cost by what is known as cost per flight hour. Cost per flight hour is derived by calculating the cost of the vehical and it&#039;s maintenance deviding this by years of service life then dividing that by the number of hours the asset is used.The more you fly the lower this number is, the less you fly the higher this number is.<br><br>An easy real world example of this would be a new car. Let&#039;s say I buy a 100k car and plan to own it for 10 years. So the cost each year is 10k. Lets say this year I drive it one time for 10 hours. The cost per driving hour would then be $1000 + gas and insurance. Now let&#039;s say that next year I drive the car for 1000 hours. If we were using the methodology in the critical articles they would conclude that it costs me $100k that year to drive the car, but that is obviously flawed.<br><br>This is why I don&#039;t read mainstream news.","time":1490249349,"resto":117895561,"id":"420+gWMy","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117897363,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)02:10:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117895561\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117895561<\/a><br>Something about having to protect him from violent liberuls","time":1490249405,"resto":117895561,"id":"tbvk3aNr","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117897468,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)02:11:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117896727\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117896727<\/a><br>If Obama is &quot;regularly&quot; taking time off, then by comparison Trump is constantly on vacation","time":1490249471,"resto":117895561,"id":"tbvk3aNr","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117897491,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)02:11:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"Does anyone actually have a problem with politicians being paid to do their job ? <br><br>Always found it an odd criticism","time":1490249486,"resto":117895561,"id":"CejMFi07","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":117897641,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)02:13:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117896187\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117896187<\/a><br>Chartering a puddle jumper three hours one way is a five figure deal, flying two state of the art 747s with a large staff and security detail, <br>the cargo jet carrying the fleet of armored cars and Obama&#039;s fucking 10 ton nigmobile from DC to Hawaii is going to cost more than 12 million dollars a year.","time":1490249586,"resto":117895561,"id":"xI2ZY9EV","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117897930,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)02:16:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117896354\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117896354<\/a><br>yeah this is definitaly fake news. it is taking the cost of something which exists and moving it to a different column on a spreadsheet. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Trump needs 100 SS agents on his trips to mar-a-lago<\/span><br>he needs those 100 SS agents to stand outside the white house if he is there taking a shit. <br>FALSE COSTS","time":1490249778,"resto":117895561,"id":"8qvkzww8","country":"BG","country_name":"Bulgaria"},{"no":117898529,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)02:23:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117897930\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117897930<\/a><br>Yeah the real cost is gas plus local amenities probably somewhere between 10-30k a day","time":1490250189,"resto":117895561,"id":"420+gWMy","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117898638,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)02:24:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117896187\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117896187<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;spends 22 million on one fucking vacation<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;DURR PROVE HE SPENT MORE THAN 12M A YEAR<\/span>","time":1490250273,"resto":117895561,"id":"+BZ91+Y5","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117898716,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)02:25:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117895561\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117895561<\/a><br>Fake news.<br>Trump is the best president of our country ever, you shut up.","time":1490250331,"resto":117895561,"id":"t2sLiQwq","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":117899303,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)02:32:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117897491\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117897491<\/a><br><br>He&#039;s using our taxpayer money to do way more than &quot;his job&quot;.

Some time in 2012, people started doing a leddit witchunt kind of like right now. <br>Trying to have anonymous discussion without being called a redditor got annoying, so mods put wacky filters and what not, to stop that bs for a while. And now it&#039;s back. <br>And the funny part is, being a newfag meant you asked someone what a meme or some gay shit meant or you didn&#039;t recognise a copypasta. Now it means your political opinion isn&#039;t canned and conformed to the epic 16 year olds who post here.<br>I&#039;ve been on 4chan for over a decade and literally never been a redditor. I think I&#039;ve seen screenshots of it, it&#039;s basically like digg but with more stuff. I dont care. It&#039;s just a forum. How fucking autistic are you, that you actually give a shit? It&#039;s just a website.<br>Oh my god, i have a feeling that 4chan talks about reddit more than reddit talks about itself.","time":1491448815,"resto":119696191,"id":"5Obzvupw","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119698070,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)23:26:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119697422\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119697422<\/a><br><a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/119696689#p119696689\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119696689<\/a><br><a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/119697107#p119697107\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119697107<\/a><br><a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/119695174#p119695174\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119695174<\/a><br><a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/119693693#p119693693\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119693693<\/a><br><a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/119692452#p119692452\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119692452<\/a><br><a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/119692315#p119692315\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119692315<\/a><br><a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/119692901#p119692901\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119692901<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;oldfag here.

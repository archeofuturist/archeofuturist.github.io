Would you blame the protestors for the death or would you claim that the government was responsible because they made the protest happen?","time":1492702211,"resto":121998511,"id":"fqyMSwEW","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122005416,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)11:32:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122002106\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122002106<\/a><br>HEY RETARD, the protestors ARE RIGHT WING in VENUZEULA, in my original picture.<br><br>I dont give a fuck, you shouldnt block the highway period. right or left wing, if you block it, you should get ran over because no political warrants high way blockade.","time":1492702322,"resto":121998511,"id":"axNBg8ty","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122005478,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)11:32:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122005416\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122005416<\/a><br>no political belief*","time":1492702365,"resto":121998511,"id":"axNBg8ty","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122005662,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)11:34:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"Run them over.

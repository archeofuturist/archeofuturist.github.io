In the post-industrial era, the human population will never exceed 12 billion. The carrying capacity of the Earth with post-industrial technology is 10 billion. We already use almost all of the arable land on Earth. <br><br>Fundamentally, \/pol\/ wants to increase the number of white people on the planet. This isn&#039;t going to happen because there isn&#039;t enough land and food to make it happen and because people can&#039;t stand being poorer than their parents. Millennials are on average 20% poorer than their parents at the same age, and that&#039;s why people don&#039;t have kids. Contrary to what pol believes, women in developed countries actually want to have between 2 and 3 kids, but they don&#039;t because it&#039;s too goddamned expensive. Housing is too expensive, school is too expensive, and in the US medical care is too expensive because there are so many goddamned people. People talk about economic growth these days, but it&#039;s ephemeral (digital) and goes to the top 10% of society. Socialism is pointless because it doesn&#039;t increase the amount of arable land, so it will not increase the carrying capacity of the Earth. Socialism would just inflate the price of land by redistributing wealth. Redistributing land might help eventually, but it&#039;s not going to change the carrying capacity of the Earth.","filename":"Cover_first_edition_Limits_to_growth","ext":".jpg","w":162,"h":240,"tn_w":162,"tn_h":240,"tim":1491812538717,"time":1491812538,"md5":"uNKb2GffQESFV0ElcQ80+w==","fsize":7952,"resto":0,"id":"CxqdwcDq","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"black-pill-the-conservativepol-project-is-doomed","country_name":"Canada","replies":2,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":120413207,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)04:22:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120413192\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120413192<\/a><br>Read The Great Stagnation. Read Limits to Growth. Read some goddamned books! My advice to you is to have at least 1 kid so someone cares about you when you&#039;re 80-years-old, but forget about increasing the number of white people. If you were serious about doing that, you would have joined Mormonism or the Amish by now. You would renounce &quot;shitposting,&quot; the internet, iPads, and other technology, and go live a simple, somewhat poor life raising kids, but you don&#039;t do that because you know you would hate it even more than your semi-NEET existence now. It&#039;s over guys. We were born in time to see peak Earth population. You have already lived through peak white population. From here on out, substantial population growth isn&#039;t going to happen until we colonize other planets. <br><br>This is my last post on \/pol\/, because the project is fundamentally doomed.

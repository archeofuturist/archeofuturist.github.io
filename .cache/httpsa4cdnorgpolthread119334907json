A quick glimpse at the data reveals a massive difference in taxes paid by men and women.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The first thing that comes to mind is that half of women might be at home raising kids. However, the workforce participation rate gap between men and women doesn\u2019t seem to exceed 10% in either age group<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In nearly all age groups, women receive more tax than they give. With the exception of the age group between 45-59 (a 15 year span) years old, women cost more to the state than the tax they provide. In contrast, men generate more tax revenue than they cost between 23 and 65 (a 43 year span). In the brief period in which women generate more or as much tax money than they consume, men outscore them by at least 3 times.<\/span>","filename":"389F07DC-A1B4-4228-A5DF-856E40D31CDB-1118-0000026D5522AA8D","ext":".jpg","w":527,"h":306,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":145,"tim":1491230416080,"time":1491230416,"md5":"f0kxdBTZY99FW+HcxRhUkQ==","fsize":20974,"resto":0,"id":"DDY7yAFj","country":"AU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"women-will-always-support-leftist-movements","country_name":"Australia","replies":7,"images":3,"unique_ips":3},{"no":119335085,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)10:41:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;By the end of her life, the average woman will have a negative fiscal impact of $150,000<\/span><br><br>&lt;By large, the cumulative tax money given to women outweighs the tax money generated by women.

Based on Figure 17, the closest that the average woman will come to having a positive fiscal incidence is when she is at minus $50,000 around 55 years of age. While feminists are demonizing men for benefiting from all liberties and rights they have constructed, they have oddly remained silent over the fact that anonymous male tax payers are paying women to exist.

Possible topics include Rome, China, Byzantium, Persia, etc. Only thing I can&#039;t do is anything set in India or sub-Saharan Africa because those two regions were not covered.

I also need to match it up with a scholarly book about that time period.","filename":"1484010505507","ext":".jpg","w":677,"h":782,"tn_w":216,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493495886160,"time":1493495886,"md5":"wIXQN7ixTkxVUJptdC3oiA==","fsize":95929,"resto":0,"id":"t4ErRzg\/","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"i-need-to-write-a-paper-on-a-piece-of-media-movie","country_name":"United States","replies":7,"images":0,"unique_ips":5},{"no":123373622,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)15:59:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"life of brian mate","time":1493495959,"resto":123373489,"id":"glM4aiuj","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":123373734,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)16:00:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"Monty Python&#039;s Holy Grail","time":1493496017,"resto":123373489,"id":"NV1fITNH","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123373829,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)16:00:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123373622\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123373622<\/a><br><a href=\"#p123373734\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123373734<\/a><br>Both good but I was hoping for a more serious film","time":1493496059,"resto":123373489,"id":"t4ErRzg\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123373945,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)16:01:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123373489\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123373489<\/a><br>Fatih 1453.

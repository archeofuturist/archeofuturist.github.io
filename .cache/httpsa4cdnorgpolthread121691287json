I saw this thread yesterday and thought it was a great idea. I&#039;ll recommend two resources, one is a book called GERMS and it is all about the history of biowar and bioterrorism. It goes into a bit of theory. Also I read a homeland security textbook once (once chapter of it, total was over a thousand pages) where they talk about all the different types of terrorism and protocols to respond. That book would be REALLY useful in terms of a happening, I forget what it was called other than &quot;DHS Textbook&quot; and I found it in the context of bioterrorism research (for a class).<br><br>The other resource that is pretty good is a person who actually seems to be a consultant (in a psychology\/philosophy speech giving kind of way, as far as I know) for NSA, Secret Service, DARPA, etc etc. His name is Richard Thieme and he speaks at DefCon pretty much every year in a row for over 20 years. He is getting old but still a very nice guy, even if he isn&#039;t as technical as much as a cold war era guy. Honestly I think just about all of his speeches are good, even though when he gave a biohacking speech it was fairly non-technical. He isn&#039;t an engineer, his background is in religion and philosophy and he gives talks on psychology to spooks, basically https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/results?sea<wbr>rch_query=Richard+Thieme","filename":"1492452296292 (1)","ext":".jpg","w":720,"h":665,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":230,"tim":1492526394572,"time":1492526394,"md5":"Zv4WHtDAitqxGS8OdobHjw==","fsize":52630,"resto":0,"id":"zSnsRK5G","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"deep-state-reading-list","country_name":"United States","replies":4,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":121691918,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)10:46:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"he talks a lot about working for agencies in crisis times and burn out that happens to people who work with classified information in high stakes for their career. i guess that is his specialty, secondary trauma, paranoia, etc.<br>&quot;The Impact of SEcrets and Dark Knowledge&quot; https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Iow<wbr>HTVxHpAs<br><br>&quot;The only way to tell the truth is in fiction&quot; https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Eds<wbr>JulQdUcg<br><br>&quot;The Government and UFOs&quot; https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=r8k<wbr>5kGbCR0M<br><br>&quot;Hacking the human body&quot; https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=KDP<wbr>LV4S6hgQ <br><br>here is a speech from another deep state hacker (who is known by the public) his name is Mudge he was a famous hacker in the 90s who ended up starting DARPA&#039;s cyber grant program after 2000 and he talks about a few funny things like hanging out with Julian Assange (in Germany, iirc) and iirc he left DARPA for Google.<br>&quot;Unexpected Stories -<br> From a hacker who made it inside the government&quot; https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=h9w<wbr>Xq6oRBnI","time":1492526813,"resto":121691287,"id":"zSnsRK5G","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121692216,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)10:50:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"any recommendations on other good DEF CON speakers to watch on YouTube?","time":1492527011,"resto":121691287,"id":"zSnsRK5G","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121692819,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)10:56:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"Bumping for interest","time":1492527382,"resto":121691287,"id":"nhWm0JFT","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121694640,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)11:13:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"Bump","time":1492528425,"resto":121691287,"id":"84CWGp\/K","country":"RS","country_name":"Serbia"}]}

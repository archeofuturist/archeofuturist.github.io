Here&#039;s my opinion on candidate performance and what they said.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Melanchon<\/span><br>Many consider him the victor and he did earn few more points, making him almost tied with Fillon. Problem is: all he did was mocking and correcting others. At no point he actually made a clear proposition. For him, being president is more about morality and making decisions but while I kinda agree, you can feel the ideas he defends aren&#039;t exactly his convictions. He play the extreme left because it&#039;s his niche, that&#039;s all.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Fillon<\/span><br>Cold and defensive, he wasn&#039;t happy to be here and used most of his time to shut off anyone mocking him for the affairs. As usual, he was true to his convictions: the future is bleak, we need to make money, let&#039;s destroy public services and sell it to the private sector... except when he has to talk about &quot;urgent&quot; problems like terrorism and promise more public jobs against that while he was the one to reduce them in the first place. That&#039;s one of his true weakness, not the affairs.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Marine LePen<\/span><br>She barely said anything. I think she was too happy to not be the center of all attacks and choosed to be &quot;presidential&quot; by not going all out... but it ended up kinda weak. Her program ended up very social economically, with her defending public services the most (I was surprise by that) and very right-wing socialy (France is Catholic... Melanchon gunned her down for that one).<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Macron<\/span><br>Asselinaut destroyed him with this simple truth: he agrees with everyone. Why ? Because he&#039;ll say anything to get votes and have no convictions whatsoever.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Poutou<\/span><br>He was weird at the start and way too agressive but became a bit more interesting towards the end while discussing better issues. He&#039;s coherent for what he wants.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Arthaud<\/span><br>Complete opposite of Poutou, she came up ridiculous, bringing the fight against business owners in EVERY SINGLE QUESTION like a broken record.<br><br>To continue","filename":"2048x1536-fit_11-candidats-election-presidentielle-grand-debat-bfm-tv-4-avril-2017","ext":".jpg","w":1296,"h":830,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":160,"tim":1491490595998,"time":1491490595,"md5":"UFxBDEMe6TF153sk58IIqw==","fsize":75133,"resto":0,"id":"k27nAFhe","country":"FR","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"heres-a-thread-to-talk-again-about-the-last","country_name":"France","replies":4,"images":1,"unique_ips":2},{"no":119750892,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)11:03:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119750284\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119750284<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Asselinaut<\/span><br>He was so against Europe, it kinda sounded like Arthaud and capitalism but he was more coherent and more, MUCH more argumentative. Problem is, he tried to do his usual lectures about constitution and the 1m30s format to answer is NOT a good format for that. Citing articles is NOT a good idea.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Cheminade<\/span><br>He talked as if everyone already knows what he thinks and that made him unclear on many subjects. He corrected many other candidates but that make him looks like an old boring teacher, not a candidate.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Hamon<\/span><br>I AM NOT MELANCHON ! LOOK AT ME ! He tried desperatly to act as the &quot;anti-system&quot; candidate but is still far too tame to exist amongst the likes of Melanchon or Lepen. The man is the candidate of the goddam socialist party and acts like he&#039;s Poutou. It was a mistake to pick him and he should assume Hollande&#039;s legacy and go down with the ship if need be, not trying to prove he&#039;s different and end up with even LESS vote.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; NDA<\/span><br>It&#039;s painful when he talks but he attacked and embarassed so many people, he gets a pass. The man is mostly a fraud, he was abandonned by everyone after a failed coup inside his party and now only his ego keeps him in politics.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; LaSalle<\/span><br>Oh please, please shut up.","time":1491491016,"resto":119750284,"id":"k27nAFhe","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":119751650,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)11:11:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"I might add the worst offender during the debate was Ruth Elkrief, the journalist, extremely pro-Macron and very very stupid in her questioning.

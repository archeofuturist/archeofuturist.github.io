According to sources briefed on the discussions, network executives are preparing to announce O\u2019Reilly\u2019s departure before he returns from an Italian vacation on April 24. Now the big questions are how the exit will look and who will replace him.<br><br>Wednesday morning, according to sources, executives are holding emergency meetings to discuss how they can sever the relationship with the country\u2019s highest-rated cable-news host without causing collateral damage to the network. The board of Fox News\u2019 parent company, 21st Century Fox, is scheduled to meet on Thursday to discuss the matter.<br><br>Sources briefed on the discussions say O\u2019Reilly\u2019s exit negotiations are moving quickly. Right now, a key issue on the table is whether he would be allowed to say good-bye to his audience, perhaps the most loyal in all of cable (O\u2019Reilly\u2019s ratings have ticked up during the sexual-harassment allegations). Fox executives are leaning against allowing him to have a sign-off, sources say. The other main issue on the table is money.

When Roger Ailes left Fox News last summer, the Murdochs paid out $40 million, the remainder of his contract.<br><br>According to sources, Fox News wants the transition to be seamless. Executives are currently debating possible replacement hosts. Names that have been discussed include Eric Bolling, Dana Perino, and Tucker Carlson, who would move from his successful 9 p.m. slot and create a need for a new host at that time. One source said Sean Hannity is happy at 10 p.m. and would not want to move.","time":1492616741,"resto":121857447,"id":"e58mLXLN","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121858158,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)11:51:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121857447\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121857447<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;No Bill<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;No MEGYN<\/span><br><br>well at least they have Cucker Carlson, kikehammer, shepherd shit, greg gutless and Sean &quot;stuck at midnight&quot; hannity.","time":1492617080,"resto":121857447,"id":"n2FVwl8F","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121858261,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)11:52:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121857447\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121857447<\/a><br><br>Pure fucking bullshit that women can get anyone removed from their position.","time":1492617150,"resto":121857447,"id":"Y6VafMXY","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121858409,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)11:53:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121858261\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121858261<\/a><br><br>Yep.

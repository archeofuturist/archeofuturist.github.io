Anyone under 21 shouldn&#039;t be permitted to purchase cigarettes, pornography firearms, or tattoos, enlist in the military, enter into a contract, or any of the other responsibilities we entrust to these 18-20 year old dipshits. They shouldn&#039;t be treated as adults and thus expected to have the life experience or mental faculties to appropriately handle the privileges or obligations. It&#039;s part of what&#039;s eroding society. We don&#039;t even expect them to finish school by then, FFS, unless they plan on being a dope-dealing thug or a burger-flipping retard.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;inb4 hurr durr you&#039;re just making a devil&#039;s advocate argument for people to buy alcohol at 18<\/span><br><br>Fuck if I am.

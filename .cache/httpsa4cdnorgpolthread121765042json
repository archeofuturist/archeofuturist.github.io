No long lines at check-in. Porters existed that carried your luggage for you (luggage had no wheels or spun in all directions). Check in ladies were thin, young and good looking. Airlines had weight restrictions for employees and unwritten requirements for aesthetic looks over ugliness. There always was some sort of security, be it a gate or metal detector. But, you did not need any ID. Yes, you could walk into an airport and walk right up to a gate to greet your family as they arrived. There were much more airlines to choose from. Smoking was allowed. Usually the last 8-12 rows of the plane were smoking. I remember flying and sitting up front and looking back into a haze of smoke. Every seat had an ashtray. Food, meals and alcohol was free. If you asked, you would get airline playing cards, plastic wings, plus any other kitsch that they had. Longer flights had a pillow and blanket on every seat. Seats were bigger and more comfy plus the rows were spaced wider apart. Everything was geared towards the consumer. <br><br>Flying in the 90&#039;s, porters no longer existed as everyone had luggage on wheels that they pulled behind them with a strap. There was still a decent selection of airlines to choose from and the majority of stewardesses were young and thin. Security same as the 80&#039;s. Seats and rows were wide and comfy and a pillow, blanket and now headphones were on every seat. Food, snacks, meals and alcohol were free and abundant. Smoking was no longer permitted and ashtrays in the seats were still present or removed and covered over with a metal patch. Airlines still catered to the consumer.<br><br>I flew from Columbus, OH to Norfolk, VA 3-mos post 9\/11. Needed 2 forms ID, 2 plus hrs. wait for security, every carry-on opened and searched PLUS swabbed for explosive residue. No nail files, pocket knifes or nail clippers allowed.

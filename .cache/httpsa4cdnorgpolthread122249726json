It is not necessarily &quot;natural&quot; for sex to be such an important part of a relationship.<br><br>Think back to 100 years ago. Sex was really not as big of a deal. People married in their 20&#039;s and had all their sex then. After some years of marriage, the sex drive tapered off, and it became impractical to keep having sex because they had too many children. Then married life became about raising a family, working a job, engaging in the community, religion, hobbies etc etc Sex was such a small part of life. Cheating was rare and scandlous because of the risk of pregnancy.<br><br>But then everything changed when contraception became widely available some 50 years ago. Humanity is free now, no longer bound by the consequences of sex. This is what we have been waiting for for the last 100,000 years of modern human history. Sex doesn&#039;t just have to be a part of life anymore. It can be its own thing that can be something to be pursued.<br><br>And it seems like everyone agrees that this is a good thing. But there are some problems.<br>Tapering off of sex and settling into a routine isn&#039;t seen as a normal progression of a relationship anymore. It is seen as serious problem, and grounds for termination of a relationship.<br>The absolutely out of control divorce race in western countries is a symptom of that. People in relationships are judged on their sexual prowess and can be discarded even if they are otherwise good partners. Marriage rates are falling. Divorce is going up. Hookup culture is popular now, and that leads to messy things like sexual assualt and rape allegations. Some people can&#039;t even compete in the new world and end up involuntarily celibate. All because of the changing attitudes to sex caused by the arrival of contraceptives.<br><br>Nobody &quot;needs&quot; to be constantly sexually satisfied. You only believe that because you are told that.

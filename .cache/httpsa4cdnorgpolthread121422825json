When the kids are old enough to go to school they should be working part time. They can drop the kids off at school at 8am and then work until 1pm or so just so they have a little cash for themselves. This is entirely optional, but most women would want a taste of it. Otherwise we should be having 5 kids. Two to replace yourselves, two to double up, and one to grow on.","time":1492380836,"resto":121422825,"id":"ZwP49MmC","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

But you have to realize that these are the Jews who are the first to condemn and hate Israel too; Een Ander Joods Geluid, the PvdA Jews who continue to support the party as it has taken an anti-Israeli turn, etc. Highly educated left-wing Jews in the diaspora are terrible and big pushers of progressivism, globalism and open borders, it&#039;s absolutely true. I&#039;m a right-wing Jew and I hate these people&#039;s views myself.<br><br>But the real Israeli right is not like that, the Israeli people are not like that, and many ordinary Jews in the West are not like that either. I understand all too well how you have arrived at your conclusions because I agree with much of the assessment on which it is based; I also think Jews who are &quot;on the right side&quot; in this should do more to speak out. But know that there are huge differences on this within Jewish communities, both internationally (diaspora vs. Israel) and nationally (because there are Jews like PVV MP Markuszower, not exactly an open borders pusher, and me too).<br><br>Lastly you shouldn&#039;t underestimate the extent to which our own Dutch businesses have pushed for open borders and Muslim immigration. It was not &quot;the Jews&quot; but rather big businesses, KVP and VVD that let in the &quot;gastarbeiders&quot;.","time":1491172198,"resto":119254770,"id":"58wFoRmU","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"}]}

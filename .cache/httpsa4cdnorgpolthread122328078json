During the 1960&#039;s the sexual revolution began and it was young men in universities who drove it. These young men were indoctrinated by the poisonous subversive tool of critical theory, which rejects everything and offers no alternative, leading to a view of the world devoid of positive affirmations - nihilism. The logical conclusion to nihilism in a behavioral sense is hedonism, which was the defining characteristic of the boomer generation. At the time this began, most women still wanted children, adhering to their natural instincts and not as much to academic propaganda, and had to be convinced by men to give up that desire in favor of a more carefree and &quot;liberated&quot; lifestyle. <br><br>Fast forward to now, where the intellectual men of our generation were raised by hedonistic boomers and often single mothers, and resent them for depriving them of a decent upbringing. As a result, the men now wish to live the way people lived before the boomers arrived - a traditional lifestyle. Part of that lifestyle is having children, but now that women have been spearheaded into the universities, it is they who are falling for the same propaganda under different name (feminism) and who are relentlessly pursuing the narrative of the carefree, hedonistic, &quot;liberated&quot; lifestyle that men drove in the 60&#039;s. How hilariously ironic that feminism was started by men to serve male interests. <br><br>The pendulum is now on its way back to equilibrium, which will mark a permanent change. We can only try and hope that it settles at a point where both men and women want children again in the west, or the world will quickly be overrun by Africans.","time":1492897786,"resto":122328078,"id":"4LkkFIyB","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122332654,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)17:50:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122328078\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122328078<\/a><br>women equate their physical beauty to their self-worth, so having babies reduces their value.

The government didn&#039;t do nothing. In fact, the action took in response to that and the early 20s recessions were the precursor to the New Deal.<br><br>Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz&#039;s Monetary History pins the blame on the Fed&#039;s overreaction to post-World War I inflation. It raised interest rates to new heights that put a massive deflationary pressure on the economy. There was also a general glut of agricultural products at the time as rations were no longer being sent overseas to troops in Europe. This would have had a big deflationary effect as well. <br>The tax cuts and lower tariffs never happened, at least not during the period of 1920-1921. Harding didn&#039;t cut taxes until after the Depression had blown over and never lowered tariffs -- in fact, he signed the Fordney-McCumber act in 1922 which raised them. <br>Harding wasn&#039;t 100% laissez-faire. While he did cut spending and maintained a balanced budget, he also passed the Farm Acts, a set of new regulations on agriculture.

Less expensive usually goes hand in hand with less quality. A large poor\/middle class removes too many people from the rural landscape, which is arguably a better\/more fullfilling lifestyle than what those classes offer in an urban setting. <br><br>One could argue that the larger our population gets, the more obvious it will become that a strictly capitalist system isn&#039;t sufficient. More efficiencies lead to less jobs, which leads to more unemployment, leading to more welfare cases. As effiency goes up (jobs go down) and population goes up, the only solution is a socialist\/communist type system.","time":1490663012,"resto":118582805,"id":"59w++8sC","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118589238,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)21:04:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"i like her final fantasy armor. what material u think she uses","time":1490663041,"resto":118582805,"id":"xLcX8ipY","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118589342,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)21:04:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118589238\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118589238<\/a><br>*materia fucking autocorrect","time":1490663091,"resto":118582805,"id":"xLcX8ipY","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118589579,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)21:06:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"leave it to pol to always defend billionaire globalist elites","filename":"OBAMA LEAF WINS AGAIN83 right wing retard ninjas","ext":".jpg","w":1080,"h":1080,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490663208502,"time":1490663208,"md5":"wnM++tvJGg9\/zGZAaZmcig==","fsize":140842,"resto":118582805,"id":"eKuqAa+F","country":"CA","m_img":1,"country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118589668,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)21:07:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"OP is right.

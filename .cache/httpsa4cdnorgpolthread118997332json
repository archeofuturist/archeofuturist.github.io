Under Nationalist rule only 2% Chinese commoners could read. Under Communist rule once Mao Zedong (head of State) was in power with assistance from Zhou Enlai (head of government) literacy rose to 97% and equal rights for women were instated. Yeah sure later on they purged their people by making bad choices but they themselves were school teachers with no political training due to the nationalist grip on the population and allowing commoners to participate in politics. I blame the Nationalists simply because LIN SEN (head of state) and Jiang Jeishei (head of government) literally sat back in the palace in Chongqing during the Rape of Nanking. Going so far as to ORDER their generals to refuse assistance to the people because they wrongly believed that the Japanese would advance on Mao Zedong and his communist forces in the mountains as their next target if they lost minimal forces opposing them. The idea was that they would let the japanese solve their communist problem. Turns out the Japanese didn&#039;t believe running through the moutainside of XIBET-SHEN-MA was a strategic idea so they continued to destroy the chinese countryside UNCONTESTED because of the nationalist corruption and stupidity. The Nationalists held onto their power until the very end even as the communists took over and defended the countryside from the japanese eventually once the japs began to run out of oil due to american embargos. The nationalist aristocracy sacrificed 100s of thousands of their own people FLEEING to the coast and escaping to Taiwan. For that they should all be burned","time":1490923650,"resto":118997332,"id":"HwNmhQTS","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118999779,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)21:28:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118997398\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118997398<\/a><br>The same can be said about USA....<br><br>Here&#039;s why I don&#039;t get the debt hype of China:<br>1) confusing currency situation; an offshore yuan and a domestic yuan.

I think one of the more distressing set of statistics I&#039;ve seen to do with Islam is how many basically ordinary people are either OK with or desirous of the actions and intentions of the radical factions. I think Trump was very wise to single that out as the dividing line, even if maybe he didn&#039;t explain it very well.","time":1490328880,"resto":118032018,"id":"cKF9SROz","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

The educated Negro of today is a failure, not because he meets insuperable difficulties in life, but because he is a Negro. He is, in brief, a low-caste man, to the manner born, and he will remain inert and inefficient until 50 generations of him have lived in civilization. And even then, the superior white race will be 50 generations ahead of him.","filename":"H.L.

I have a buddy who hates Trump and constantly uses hyperbole discussing that he wants to kill Trump and it&#039;s always based on mundane shit. It&#039;s easier in his mind to vilify Trump with extreme hyperbole rather then argue him for what he really is which isn&#039;t so black and white. My friends mindset scares me though. If he gets that way with Trump who knows how far we are with liberals using hyperbole to justify locking up or mass murdering conservatives.

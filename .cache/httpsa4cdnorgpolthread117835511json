If anything we should aspire to be like them . But you know who are the ones that truly have privelidge and I just completely detest these ppl . Ppl who fucking sit on their asses all day on their fathers dimes never work a day in their lives . Ppl like Paris Hilton the kardashians . Their job is literally to look pretty. That is like privelidge to the highest level .And you&#039;re sitting here whining about racism . Nothing is stopping you. Maybe you don&#039;t have as much money as white ppl do but maybe that&#039;s because they tend to have their shit together and you don&#039;t.

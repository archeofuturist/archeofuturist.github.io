And not just Sweden of course. But this kind of shit, it&#039;s so fucking absurd that it has lost any notion of what I thought was reality, and it just becomes unintentional satire.<br><br>Honestly, I didn&#039;t read through it all. I had to stop at page 9, when I came across pic related. Look at the picture. Look at it again. This picture takes up a single page. It is situated between the sections titled &quot;Trans Health Care&quot; and &quot;Family Planning.&quot; It isn&#039;t referred to in the document. It is given no context. Look at it again. It is there simply for decoration.<br><br>That&#039;s all. I had to type this out. I had to share whatever this feeling I have right now is, with anyone who happens to see it.","filename":"sweden yes","ext":".jpg","w":557,"h":790,"tn_w":176,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491424363718,"time":1491424363,"md5":"Bsx89qm\/J2Hs2HEaOIGsfA==","fsize":59465,"resto":0,"id":"eR1vwUxE","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"sexual-health-packet-for-lgbtq-migrants-put-out","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":9,"images":1,"unique_ips":5},{"no":119652249,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)16:34:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;RFSL<\/span><br><br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Swedi<wbr>sh_Federation_for_Lesbian,_Gay,_Bis<wbr>exual_and_Transgender_Rights<br><br>they&#039;re not a government organization<br><br>sorry","time":1491424463,"resto":119652056,"id":"xBe2\/qD3","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":119652391,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)16:35:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119652249\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119652249<\/a><br><br>t.

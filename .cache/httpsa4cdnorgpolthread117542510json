If you ask, scientists will happily admit that - and then immediately dismiss the possibility of &#039;intelligent design&#039; for other reasons.. Science doesn&#039;t talk about it much but many popular scientific theories started out as &quot;ok, assume an intelligent being didn&#039;t design this; what ELSE could have caused this &#039;apparent design&#039; in biology, mathematics, cosmology, biochemistry etc etc?<br><br>That&#039;s not to say that creationism\/intelligent design\/God is scientifically PROVEN either.

Faith beyond rational proof is the very point - what good are good deeds if one has no other choice? Free will REQUIRES a choice between holy intuition and temptation. The POSSIBILITY of escaping ultimate judgement is necessary for temptation.

The deduction isn&#039;t so simple. Religious people like to spout off about rocks not having will or animation and other such simple and laughable statements, but it just isn&#039;t that simple. A rock is a vastly complex arrangement of elemental atoms that are arranged in a specific manner. It is not a life form, but every bit of the matter that the rock is made of may have been part of a living organism at one point, or can become one later. Atoms have physical properties that cause them to be constantly animated, and also have preset behaviors as to how they interact with other matter. To give a definitive statement that I know where life came from would make me sound as silly as you, but science has been able to observe the simplest organisms, not much more than a minuscule energy conversion device that takes one chemical and converts it to another, taking energy from the conversion to persist long enough to complete the transaction over and over again and even reproduce if it&#039;s successful. Science has also given basic elements the proper conditions - heat, light to form more and more complex chemicals up to basic amino acids, many of the building blocks of basic life. We haven&#039;t reproduced the jump from chemistry to life yet, but we&#039;ve only been even smart enough to record history, spottily at best, for the last six thousand years, so you can&#039;t expect to learn everything at once. <br><br>In the end, I always expect that the main obstacle to understanding of this concept is the individual&#039;s understanding and grasp of time. People know that 2,000 years is a long time, but only because it&#039;s so many times more than the twenty, fifty or even hundred that they&#039;ve been around for. Extend that to 200,000,000 years, and people simply reach a point where it just doesn&#039;t register anymore.

I don&#039;t believe it&#039;s beyond our understanding, and I don&#039;t think it&#039;s beyond yours, but your total understanding of something you think is similar is limiting you in that you&#039;re drawing parallels where they aren&#039;t warranted or deserved. Evolution is too complex to draw direct comparisons to anything we&#039;ve accomplished as of yet. You can&#039;t write that program. Everything changes always. Patterns emerge and disappear. Conditions change for the worse and eliminate 90% of the variations, then they change back later on and triple the variations that once existed. Life has been nearly wiped out completely on the planet several times, yet we keep getting vast variations in both the fossil records before these extinctions and the biological record now. The fossil record shows at least twice where land-based animals disappeared completely from vast regions due to cataclysms, only to be replaced by ones that never existed before millions of years later. Evolution is clear is you look at the whole picture at once and only reinforces itself as you look closer.","time":1490067382,"resto":117542510,"id":"ravtwlVZ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117581361,"now":"03\/20\/17(Mon)23:37:22","name":"CUNT","com":"IT DIDN&#039;T FELL FROM THE SKY<br>IT WAS WRITTEN BY A MAN<br>THE BIBLE!

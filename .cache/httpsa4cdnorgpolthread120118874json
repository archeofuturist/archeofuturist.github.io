That&#039;s a fancy way to say they&#039;re opposite ideologies designed to clash, like Yin and Yang.<br> <br>NatSoc was fundamentally an ideology built around race, while Marxist socialism was entirely different: built around class. Hitler aimed to unite the right and left, including workers and their bosses, into a new German nation based on racial identity. Socialism, in contrast, was a class war between workers, bosses, and owners (Capitalists), aiming to build a workers state in which race and gender were insignificant. Socialists, especially Marxist socialists, were anti-religious atheists, whereas NatSoc went so far as to make Christianity the religion of the state.<br> <br>The differences go on and on: Marxist socialism was internationalist, NatSoc was nationalist. Marxist socialism was egalitarian, whereas NatSoc believed that nature was unequal and required competition. Marxist socialism wanted to nationalize all private industry, while NatSoc privatized every major industry except the railroads (it considered these a military asset. In fact, Hitler once joked &quot;they didn&#039;t need to nationalize property because they nationalized people&quot;. NatSoc drew on a range of pan-German theories, which wanted to blend Aryan workers and Aryan magnates into a super Aryan state, which would involve the eradication of class-focused socialism as a non-German ideology.","time":1491649554,"resto":120118874,"id":"eZAWXsvG","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120119063,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)07:07:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"\u5350 - MYTHS ABOUT NATSOC (Part 2)<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;National Socialism is just (((socialism)))&quot;<\/span><br> <br>NatSoc redefined socialism as &quot;Germanism\/Volkism&quot;, which they saw as &quot;producer-oriented capitalism&quot;, as opposed to &quot;Jewish capitalism&quot;, aka, international finance, globalism, wall street, etc. In theory, NatSoc economics was a version of Keynesianism, tailored to the V\u00f6lkisch nature of whichever people adopted it. Its not one dogmatic economic system,and Hitler often joked that the lack of a specific ideology was their strength. NatSoc could be more &quot;free market&quot; as Americans know it, or less.

((((Marxism))) is anti-property; true socialism is not. ((((Marxism))) places no value on the individual, or individual effort, of efficiency; true Socialism values the individual and encourages him in individual efficiency, at the same time holding that his interests as an individual must be in consonance with those of the community. All great inventions, discoveries, achievements were first the product of an individual brain. It is charged against me that I am against property, that I am an atheist.

The Soviet system failed, as did the Roman Empire, and every Chinese or Ottoman dynasty. Some of these examples of government lasted thousands of years, while some didn&#039;t last more than a generation. All forms of government inevitably fail. This has been true since ancient times. Polybius famously articulated this process of Anacyclosis: social organization paradigms rise, fail, and give way to further systems. This is the cycle of history.<br> <br>Fascism is not a failed system, it was a defeated system: A.) it was not an economic system, but a social one; B.) the so-called &quot;failed system&quot; had a control group: the US. Germany, Italy, and the US were operating under Keynesean policies; only one of them won the war, and experienced a massive period of growth once their industrial rivals were destroyed. So no, it wasn&#039;t a failed system, because both sides were using it, including the side that won.<br> <br>https:\/\/mises.org\/library\/three-new<wbr>-deals-why-nazis-and-fascists-loved<wbr>-fdr","time":1491649664,"resto":120118874,"id":"eZAWXsvG","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120119131,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)07:08:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"\u5350 - MYTHS ABOUT NATSOC (Part 4)<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Lebensraum:<\/span><br>&#039;Lebensraum&#039; is often intentionally exaggerated by those wanting to push the fractal &quot;Hitler planned to exterminate all races&quot; meme. The actual meaning of Lebensraum referred to the security of the German borders, and the need to provide living space so that Germans aren&#039;t threatened by outside forces. To claim that &quot;living space&quot; meant solely &quot;to exterminate and re-populate more land than there would have been Germans to inhabit, for several generations after the war&quot; is absurd, and contradicts the policies of &quot;Germanization&quot; that were ACTUALLY PRACTICED by the Germans regarding their Slavic allies:<br> <br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=8ra<wbr>-ChcOiuU<br> <br>Hitler didn&#039;t consider Russians subhuman. He considered them inferior. Because in terms of living, they were. Seriously, look at the living style of the average Soviet, then compare them to a German in 1930, they were, by all accounts inferior. He even talks about how some Russians of the old rich class were Germanic. There were multiple reasons for the invasion of the Soviet Union, for example:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;1. To gain the necessary resources to fuel a long time war, something that Germany was severely lacking.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;2. To prevent the inevitable invasion of Europe by the Soviet Union. If you gonna start a war, it&#039;s best to have the first strike.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;3. To disband the Bolshevik and Jewish regime in the Soviet Union, something Hitler knew would be a threat to Germany.<\/span><br> <br>True, the Germans would&#039;ve gained land from defeating the Soviets and would certainly have sent its citizens into this newfound land, just like the allies did to German clay they gained after WW1 and WW2.

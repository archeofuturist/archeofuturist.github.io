From magic and ghosts, religion evolved through spirits and fetishes to taboos. Every primitive tribe had its tree of forbidden fruit, literally the apple but figuratively consisting of a thousand branches hanging heavy with all sorts of taboos. And the forbidden tree always said, \u201cThou shalt not.\u201d<br><br>89:2.2 (975.6) As the savage mind evolved to that point where it envisaged both good and bad spirits, and when the taboo received the solemn sanction of evolving religion, the stage was all set for the appearance of the new conception of sin. The idea of sin was universally established in the world before revealed religion ever made its entry. It was only by the concept of sin that natural death became logical to the primitive mind. Sin was the transgression of taboo, and death was the penalty of sin.<br><br>89:2.3 (975.7) Sin was ritual, not rational; an act, not a thought. And this entire concept of sin was fostered by the lingering traditions of Dilmun and the days of a little paradise on earth. The tradition of Adam and the Garden of Eden also lent substance to the dream of a onetime \u201cgolden age\u201d of the dawn of the races. And all this confirmed the ideas later expressed in the belief that man had his origin in a special creation, that he started his career in perfection, and that transgression of the taboos \u2014 sin \u2014 brought him down to his later sorry plight.","time":1490542175,"resto":118357120,"id":"osG\/SAbQ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118372681,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)11:30:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118368289\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118368289<\/a><br>Probably bait but I&#039;ll reply.

Hunger \u2014 associated with foresight. Food saving and preservation meant power and comfort for those who possessed sufficient foresight thus to provide for future needs. Food storage was adequate insurance against famine and disaster. And the entire body of primitive mores was really designed to help man subordinate the present to the future.<br><br>69:5.5 (776.3) 2.

Power \u2014 the craving to be master. Treasure lending was carried on as a means of enslavement, one hundred per cent a year being the loan rate of these ancient times.

Bond servants were among the earliest form of property to be accumulated, and in olden days debt slavery extended even to the control of the body after death.<br><br>69:5.9 (776.7) 6.

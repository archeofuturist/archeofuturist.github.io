Pretty much everyone supported it because they have kids in the schools and because the schools here are really good and that alone makes home prices here really high. The extra value in the homes from the school district staying good offsets the minuscule increase they would have to pay. Unfortunately there is a huge 55+ boomer community in the city that also have no kids in the schools and so being the greedy boomers they are they made it fail by just a few votes so they could save 300 dollars a year. Everyone here has been shitting on them since. <br><br>Encapsulates boomers pretty well. Just a microcosmic example of them selling out the younger generation so they can save a few more shekels for their luxury suv. Nothing but contempt for these people.

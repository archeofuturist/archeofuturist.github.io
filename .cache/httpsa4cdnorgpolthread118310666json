When those fail, they will initiate violence themselves and blame the other party.<br><br>The best way to deal with this would be to use police tactics. Shield wall up front, grabbers in the back, anyone who comes close gets pulled in and gets the shit beat out of them and then pushed back out after hes to fucked up to fight anymore\/gets restrained<br><br>Another tactic antifa uses when they face a smaller but tough group is to slowly circle around them and try to either infiltrate or surround. I saw this in Berkeley. The best counter to this is to watch your back and identify anyone who is not part of your group and call them out. They will run and hide back into their main group.<br><br>The third tactic antifa uses when they are outnumbered. Basically run up, pepper spray, and run away before the blinded people get you. best counter is to wear sealed googles\/masks or just quickly turn around and cover your face when you see them running up. Then grab them, get them to the ground, and take their spray. Fuck them up, then Let them run away in shame.","filename":"1490497148922","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":682,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1490501966291,"time":1490501966,"md5":"hCXNHz4uHKT7S92tq3w9cQ==","fsize":236922,"resto":118310666,"id":"ed9KDz9\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118319598,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)00:31:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118310666\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118310666<\/a><br>if you want to see upcoming rallies and them bitch about shit, theres always https:\/\/itsgoingdown.org\/.","time":1490502678,"resto":118310666,"id":"G+LVuQw1","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118319861,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)00:34:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118314003\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118314003<\/a><br>well this is easy to screw with<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;make own affinity group with \/pol\/acks<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;infiltrate<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;shout orders to take command of them<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;walk them off bridge<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;??????<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;bees.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;definitely needs to include bees somehow<\/span>","time":1490502840,"resto":118310666,"id":"ZAQlGTXk","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118320264,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)00:38:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118317490\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118317490<\/a><br>good to know, we should do this. <br>print google map images of it too<br>plan routes<br>etc. etc.<br><br><a href=\"#p118318537\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118318537<\/a><br>a way to counter the 2nd tactic is to have two small groups to sandwich those who get behind the original group<br><br>similar to this, with the 3rd tactic have flankers smash into them when they do this<br><br>for the first option I recommend the &quot;grab-n-drag&quot; technique I learned from watching homeless people fight. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;grab them by the head, not the neck, not the arm, but the head<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;kick their legs out<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;drag them violently and quickly away<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;pick up<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;slam on ground<\/span>","time":1490503095,"resto":118310666,"id":"ZAQlGTXk","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118320830,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)00:44:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118319598\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118319598<\/a><br>this is a useful site...<br><br>i believe kek would be please if a few members of the \/pol\/is were to make there way over here...","filename":"psypepe","ext":".jpg","w":804,"h":691,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":107,"tim":1490503465005,"time":1490503465,"md5":"kWcINvW1zpb9GSUXR0553Q==","fsize":85102,"resto":118310666,"id":"Phz7REvN","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118321439,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)00:51:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118318537\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118318537<\/a><br>Honestly the best way to beat Antifa is with better discipline.

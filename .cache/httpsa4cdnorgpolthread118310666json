The number of broken windows pales in comparison to the number of spells\u2014spells cast by a corporate hegemony to lull us into forgetfulness of all the violence committed in the name of private property rights and of all the potential of a society without them.

When those fail, they will initiate violence themselves and blame the other party.<br><br>The best way to deal with this would be to use police tactics. Shield wall up front, grabbers in the back, anyone who comes close gets pulled in and gets the shit beat out of them and then pushed back out after hes to fucked up to fight anymore\/gets restrained<br><br>Another tactic antifa uses when they face a smaller but tough group is to slowly circle around them and try to either infiltrate or surround. I saw this in Berkeley. The best counter to this is to watch your back and identify anyone who is not part of your group and call them out. They will run and hide back into their main group.<br><br>The third tactic antifa uses when they are outnumbered. Basically run up, pepper spray, and run away before the blinded people get you. best counter is to wear sealed googles\/masks or just quickly turn around and cover your face when you see them running up. Then grab them, get them to the ground, and take their spray. Fuck them up, then Let them run away in shame.","filename":"1490497148922","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":682,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1490501966291,"time":1490501966,"md5":"hCXNHz4uHKT7S92tq3w9cQ==","fsize":236922,"resto":118310666,"id":"ed9KDz9\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

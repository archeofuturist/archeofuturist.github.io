For the next 30 years Bennett taught the Gurdjieff method, while dabbling in other mystical sects along the way. He created his own \u201cInstitute for the Comparative Study of History, Philosophy and the Sciences\u201d in the UK in 1946, centered on the Gurdjieff method but bringing together other mystics from around the world\u2014a perfect petri dish for both pro ling and manipulating such movements.<br>In 1956, a member of the Subud movement showed up at Bennett\u2019s Institute, and Bennett joined the move- ment immediately.

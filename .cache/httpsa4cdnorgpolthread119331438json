If you totally ignore the lefts push towards multiculturalism, and look at the similarities between the two it is staggering.<br><br> Nazi&#039;s believed in national healthcare, The Left believes in nationalized healthcare. <br>Nazi&#039;s regulate industries and force them to follow their strict demanding quotas, Liberals want to regulate industries as well.<br>Nazi&#039;s go after anyone that questions their ideology and censors them by name calling them Jews and race traitors. The Leftist censor peoples opinions and label them racist and homophobic.<br>The Nazi&#039;s wanted to take down the Jews which accounted for only 0.75% of the population (close to 1%). The left want to take down the 1% elite.<br>The Nazi&#039;s were obsessed about race and weaponize it to gain power of Germany. Liberals are obsessed about race and weaponize it to gain power in western countries.<br>Nazi&#039;s blamed everything on the Jews, Leftist blame everything on white men.<br>Nazi&#039;s had higher taxation for the middle and upper classes it could be 50% of their wealth for conquered people it was 100% to fund their government programs, The left gives higher taxation to fund their retarded government programs.<br>Nazi&#039;s are pro abortion, The left are pro abortion.<br><br>True Right wing conservatives want small government and oppose tyranny, We promote capitalism and see the benefits of a free market not heavily regulated, We are NOT socialist and believe that that government taxation should be minimized and not be so high. National Socialism is a direct contradiction to what the right believes and is way more Left wing than right wing.","filename":"LiterallyHitler","ext":".jpg","w":480,"h":360,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1491228299950,"time":1491228299,"md5":"RYhaoCT454QxgikofLgS5A==","fsize":15810,"resto":0,"id":"TDy9Ew5n","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"nazism-is-left-wing","country_name":"United States","replies":153,"images":19,"unique_ips":54,"tail_size":50},{"no":119331738,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)10:08:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"Liberalists and Ancaps are pro-open borders, pro race-mixing faggots with no concept of nation and kin.

How do you solve this problem? They couldn&#039;t print money because nobody wanted it, and nobody would lend them money either.<br>The solution was to sell off gold. Whatever was in the Reichsbank at the time, whatever they could confiscate, churches and museums got raided etc. This gold was melted and sold to the Swiss national bank for Swiss currency.<br>Just like today, the Swiss do not use their currency to finance their country. There is very little inflation and it is a stable currency in general. It was accepted virtually everywhere in the world. The Nazis used Swiss currency to finance their war industry: Buying Turkish and Swedish steel and precious metals, it all was paid with Swiss currency.<br>You may ask why this is relevant. Once German workers were working in the armament industry, they earned German money. It was still worth about nothing, but since they had more than before, they could exchange it for goods again.<br>Once the phony recovery was believable enough, demand for consumer goods rose a bit, which is the &quot;economic boom&quot;. Since every German worker had state issued paper money, living standards improved somewhat.<br>You might say well, this is economic whichcraft and it did work. To which I say yes, it did work for about 5 years and it probably would for another 2-3 years.

This group put emphasis on the words &quot;socialist&quot; and &quot;workers&quot; in the party&#039;s name, which put them ideologically closer to the Communists. They largely rejected capitalism (which they associated with Jews), and pushed for nationalization of major industrial firms, expansion of worker control, confiscation and redistribution of the estates of the old aristocracy, and social equality. R\u00f6hm spoke of a &quot;second revolution&quot; against the &quot;Reaktion&quot; (the National Socialist label for conservatives).<br><br>These plans were threatening to the business community in general, and to Hitler&#039;s corporate financial backers in particular, including many German industrial leaders (who hoped to reap huge profits from the coming Nazi military buildup), so Hitler swiftly reassured his powerful industrial allies that there would be no &quot;second revolution.&quot; Many SA &quot;storm troopers&quot; had working-class origins and expected a radical programme. They were disappointed by the new regime&#039;s lack of socialistic direction and its failure to provide the lavish patronage they had expected. Furthermore, R\u00f6hm and his SA colleagues thought of their force as the core of the future German army, and saw themselves as replacing the Reichswehr and its established professional officer corps. By then, the SA had swollen to over three million men, dwarfing the Reichswehr, which was limited to 100,000 men by the Treaty of Versailles. Although R\u00f6hm had been a member of the officer corps, he viewed them as &quot;old fogies&quot; who lacked &quot;revolutionary spirit.&quot; He believed that the Reichswehr should be merged into the SA to form a true &quot;people&#039;s army&quot; under his command. At a February 1934 cabinet meeting, R\u00f6hm demanded that the merge be made, under his leadership as Minister of Defence.[7][5]","time":1491236073,"resto":119331438,"id":"AWW0vD+E","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119344797,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)12:14:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119331438\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119331438<\/a><br>Ban all Americans from \/pol\/, bunch of &quot;&#039;civil nationalists&#039;!

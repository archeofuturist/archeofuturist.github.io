It\u2019s like boredom and paranoia bred and created a disfigured child. We didn\u2019t ask for it. Nobody wants it. Why is it everywhere, hanging, stinking, like lukewarm day rotten fruit. Anyone who sees it knows it on contact. Pale and sickly. Dripping in vacuousity, begging to be cut out like an arrant tumour with a razor-sharp knife and a skilful hand. <br><br>What did we do to deserve this? What did they do it deserve it? It must be torture. A gilded hell. A giant pile of fresh shit covered in sparkles. We ask them to eat it and fucking smile. We hand them the spoon, give them a napkin, sit them down at the table, and pry open their mouths. Tell me how much you love it. Tell me how much you want this. <br><br>Is it ethical to put them of their misery?","filename":"MakeMeProudSon","ext":".gif","w":499,"h":499,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":249,"tim":1491802639929,"time":1491802639,"md5":"uUTsYXCdpWOtBaybRKsMvw==","fsize":1329058,"resto":0,"id":"jyAS9jPL","country":"AU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"just-watched-an-episode-of-rich-kids-of-instagram","country_name":"Australia","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

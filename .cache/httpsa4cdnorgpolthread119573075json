While an appeal is not expected in this case, another appellate court, in Georgia, last month reached the opposite conclusion, saying that the law does not prohibit discrimination at work for gay employees.<br><br>The ruling on Tuesday comes as gay rights advocates have voiced concern about the potential rollback of protections under President Trump. While the Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage, many other legal protections, including in employment and housing, have not been extended at all levels to gay people.<br><br>In the decision on Tuesday, the judges ruled by an 8-to-3 vote that the civil rights law, which already prohibits discrimination on a variety of factors, also includes protections based on sexual orientation. They concluded that such discrimination was no different from a form of sex discrimination, which the law prohibits. Five of the eight judges in the majority were appointed by Republican presidents.<br><br>The case stems from a lawsuit by Kimberly Hively, an Indiana teacher who has alleged that she was fired from Ivy Tech Community College because she is a lesbian. She applied to six full-time jobs at the school in South Bend, Ind., that she did not get, and she was let go from her part-time position there in 2014.","filename":"CivilRightsAct","ext":".jpg","w":2048,"h":1233,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":150,"tim":1491370806580,"time":1491370806,"md5":"9nVZcBWR7v1NXNuzz+7xWw==","fsize":1048964,"resto":0,"id":"35aClIQl","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"civil-rights-act-protects-gay-workers-court-rules","country_name":"United States","replies":10,"images":1,"unique_ips":4},{"no":119573683,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)01:46:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"I thought it already did.","time":1491371205,"resto":119573075,"id":"+UAVFkqs","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119573790,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)01:47:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"Cool.

Tell me how many times you all got streets streetsigns, trucks and numbers. Literally repeating cycle easily defeated for botters.","time":1490607247,"resto":118494080,"id":"Jcozh9X6","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118494981,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)05:40:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118494538\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118494538<\/a><br><br>Yeah they should just remove the blasted captchas altogether. They obviously dont stop bots with the amount of shit pol gets. The shills need to focus on quality, because the stuff that is sent to this board is downright silly, and is actually entertaining to read and reply to. Someone needs to be fired for shilling so horribly.","time":1490607618,"resto":118494080,"id":"s5Js\/HvL","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

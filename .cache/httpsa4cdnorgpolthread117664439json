GoT has it, The Walking Dead has it, The Sopranos had it (more Italian than Jewish), Black Sails has it, not as much as season 1 but still the whole lesbo thing. Seriously has anyone else noticed this? I haven&#039;t seen much in foreign movies\/shows.","filename":"desiretoknowmore","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":512,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":200,"tim":1490127296406,"time":1490127296,"md5":"GcVLhW8+lZeqm4DEDnIELw==","fsize":41541,"resto":0,"id":"boJqx1Io","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"so-while-watching-moviesshows-ive-noticed-that","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

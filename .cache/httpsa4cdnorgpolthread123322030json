Often having privacy contributes to security, like making identity theft harder. In the same vein infringements on privacy often do not contribute to security, airport security is just stupid and mostly there to line the pockets of security firms. You also see many terrorists already were on a list or known to be dangerous elements but they never acted on it because they probably have a huge list of flagged people.

As well as that denying citizens their weapons means they cannot fight in case the country&#039;s military or state will abuse their power.

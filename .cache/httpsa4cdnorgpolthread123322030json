Often having privacy contributes to security, like making identity theft harder. In the same vein infringements on privacy often do not contribute to security, airport security is just stupid and mostly there to line the pockets of security firms. You also see many terrorists already were on a list or known to be dangerous elements but they never acted on it because they probably have a huge list of flagged people. Investing the money now used on big data instead of just investigators provide superior safety and privacy. All these systems are just to control the populace, child porn and terrorism is just the lube to shove the dick of privacy infringement deeper.<br><br>Just do your best to protect the country from the worst and tell people to stop screaming about security when something does slip. People jump in cars and wreck themselves all the time, so why not accept that once in a while a nutcase shoots someone in the face. I rather have that than getting a deep rectal inspection when taking a flight.<br><br>Also the constitution is supposed to be an absolute citizen protection system. When it was made it was written with both english occupation and political theory in mind. English occupation taught them that having to take in soldiers in your house in peacetime allows far too much observation in someone&#039;s private life. As well as that denying citizens their weapons means they cannot fight in case the country&#039;s military or state will abuse their power. Political theory taught them about the power of state and h ow to limit it, as well as certain elementary freedoms should be granted to prevent popular revolt from being suppressed.<br><br>Naturally modern politicians are either retarded or powerhungry so they try to erode the constitution as much as possible.","time":1493465255,"resto":123322030,"id":"OkQvw393","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":123324383,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)07:28:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123323923\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123323923<\/a><br>sorry for your loss, but the endless cycle has ended ever since CIA lemon party gestapo decided to replace revolutions with rainbowlution powered by energy of pervertariat.

A lot of things really suck, even for a genuinely good government. But it has to be in place in order to protect citizens against a potentially bad government. It is not more susceptible to corruption than anything else. Hell, its probably better than most european systems since it has a harsher stance against infringements. However in a system as corrupt and messed up as the american politics no system can stand up. If the whole political system doesnt like the limitations the constitution pushes onto them sooner or later they can strip it down to being useless.","time":1493468008,"resto":123322030,"id":"OkQvw393","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":123327484,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)08:16:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123326517\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123326517<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;is it naive to think that we can bounce back?<\/span><br><br>You can&#039;t enter the same river twice especially if it&#039;s just a GPS point on the dried out riverbed. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;on another note, how do you feel about your constitution?<\/span><br><br>There is no such thing here.

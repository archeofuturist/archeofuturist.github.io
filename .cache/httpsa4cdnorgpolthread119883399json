The greatness of America essentially boils down to 3 things and it doesn&#039;t matter if you&#039;re an atheist or not, I&#039;m strictly talking of formula; ingredients in a pot. Those 3 are thus:<br>Judeo-Christian Morality<br>Greco-Roman Philosophy ~&amp;<br>Anglo-Saxon Law<br>I find that the humility to admit that I do indeed lack (because it is a lack) the faith is a personal flaw within my own heart. Even IF God definitely doesn&#039;t exist this is true. It is healthy for a society to have this ever present intrinsic judge in ones mind. I always felt something... off about popular atheism and it was only after I got into politics, and later Bill Whittle, that I discovered why. Christianity, at the end of the day, gets shit done. And has historically. This &quot;holds people back&quot; line every hipster leftist likes to regurgitate is pure untruth.<br>Frankly, I&#039;m at a point where I think I could defeat Richard Dawkins in a debate. (famous last words) I detect in the man an earnestness if, admittedly, also an arrogance that is so endemic in us atheists. As a millennial I certainly possessed it.<br>I also really like Stefan Molyneux but disagree entirely with his Magnum Opus; &quot;Universally Preferable Behaviour&quot;. The book is excellent, don&#039;t get me wrong, but I believe Individualist Religious morals (which orthodox Christianity is a nigh-perfect representation of) to be superior to Secular ones even IF god doesn&#039;t exist.<br> <br>See deity belief is either simply a chemical artifact of our sapience OR Gods intrinsic interaction with the makeup of our minds and, get this, it is actually irrelevant which of these is true.<br><br>I call this doctrine &quot;Atheism Minus&quot; opposed to the lefts brainwashy Atheism Plus.","filename":"1480727021010","ext":".jpg","w":625,"h":410,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":82,"tim":1491542244172,"time":1491542244,"md5":"E1wgYsTpF5fGzwqvVIYAMA==","fsize":87247,"resto":119883399,"id":"fjoBrvoY","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119889099,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)01:17:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119888604\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119888604<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Eastern and Western Orthodox christianity built on centuries of Martyrdom<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Protestantism built on the lust of a charlatan priest and tyrannical king<\/span><br><br>I think I&#039;ll know who to side with.","time":1491542245,"resto":119883399,"id":"lpeaIFct","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119889160,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)01:17:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119888904\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119888904<\/a><br>Romans was canon from the moment it was written.

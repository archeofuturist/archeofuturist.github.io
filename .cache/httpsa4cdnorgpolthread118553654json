Maybe if we converted between Celsius and micro-celcius all the time, but we don&#039;t,plus there&#039;s nothing THAT special about the boiling and freezing points of water, not in day to day human existence. Plus Fahrenheit actually seems a bit better since we don&#039;t have to fall back on decimals quite so much to describe the weather.

If less, ziplock your open packs and freeze, because open packs go stale. Supplement with smokeless or vaping if you are already a heavy smoker. Don&#039;t listen to the abstinence-only nanny organizations. Risks from smokeless and vaping are negligible. Risks from low level smoking are proportionately lower than heavy smoking no matter what they say. Cognitive relaxation and focusing power from nicotine are real, no matter how much they tell you it&#039;s nothing but alleviating withdrawal symptoms.","filename":"pipe","ext":".jpg","w":1136,"h":792,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":87,"tim":1493500751987,"time":1493500751,"md5":"jqQG4pxZLaPlXoNRrVjRtA==","fsize":542892,"resto":123375268,"id":"liSz8pzo","country":"LC","m_img":1,"country_name":"Saint Lucia"},{"no":123382931,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)17:19:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123382687\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123382687<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;the danish homeless dude looked at me like he was hurt by what I said<\/span><br>Poor guy.

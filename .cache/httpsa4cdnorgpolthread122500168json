If you fap to gay porn, that&#039;s 2 guys, and that&#039;s 100% gay. If you fap to &#039;straight&#039; porn, then that has a woman, sure, but you&#039;re also fapping to a guy, which makes it 50% gay. But a trap is like half male, half female, and thus a trap with a girl would add up to 75% girl, and thus only 25% gay. 2 women would be ideal, but that would be a lesbian relationship, which brings it around to gay again. If you fap to furry porn, then it&#039;s in a weird gray area, where if it&#039;s people in fursuits, the same rules apply, but if it&#039;s with animals, I would think it depends on said animal&#039;s sexuality. Then there&#039;s consent. If a person doesn&#039;t consent to something, but the other person does it anyway, that makes the other person stronger, and thus less gay. Let&#039;s say that means they&#039;re about 50% less gay. If it was gay rape, that means that it&#039;s now 75% gay. If it&#039;s straight rape by a man, then it&#039;s 25% gay. And, if it&#039;s trap gay porn, than that&#039;s 12.5% gay. So technically, yes, rape trap porn is the least gay porn there is, but that&#039;s still looped in with trap porn, hence why fapping to trap porn is the least gay thing there is.","time":1492991894,"resto":122500168,"id":"oI5obmDw","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]}

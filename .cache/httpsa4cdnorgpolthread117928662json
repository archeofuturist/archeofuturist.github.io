I&#039;m speaking of course of the Muslim world. Many of their core values align with our own, and they are ultimately a religious community that believes in a higher power above all of humanity. Isn&#039;t that what we strive for here in the West with Christianity? Don&#039;t we have the same values against homosexuality, the destruction of the female\/family, and degeneracy in general? Are the kikes manipulating both sides in order to ignite yet another war that only divides the world further?<br><br>I know that the muzzies are savage creatures and that they should be held back. The rising tide of Islam needs to be halted, however I just have the sinking feeling that this whole thing is a ploy to destroy the actual progression of Islam to a modern religion that strays from it&#039;s primitive roots, much like the Christianity of antiquity. Syria for instance, is a secular, but predominantly Muslim country. Why are we battling with them? I mean, our people call for the death of Assad, a man who reminds me a lot of Hitler in that he hasn&#039;t done anything really wrong in leading his people, however everywhere you look there is anti-Assad messaging being pressed from all sides.<br><br>Why? Why are we fighting the progression of Islam?

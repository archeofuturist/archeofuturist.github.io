This is the same thing they ousted Flynn for, now we have a chance. Granted, it was mainly because he lied to Pence, but nonetheless this was the part people actually cared about. Should we fan the flames and join the &quot;muh Russia&quot; narrative in order to get Bannon back in charge?","filename":"FiV2dxp[1]","ext":".png","w":715,"h":185,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":64,"tim":1493407493317,"time":1493407493,"md5":"m5Hv7XVxR6\/JRFbavJuuIQ==","fsize":46490,"resto":0,"id":"7FVlRU8J","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"our-chance-to-oust-kushner","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":123234590,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)15:35:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"I&#039;m still not convinced that he and Bibi are actually good friends.","time":1493408151,"resto":123233096,"id":"6Rp3wbQB","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123235001,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)15:39:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123234590\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123234590<\/a><br>He&#039;s a Democrat, it doesn&#039;t matter.

Donald Trump has torn it open again.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Among the many lies that he has constructed, none is more ridiculous than his attempt to contradict history by presenting the United States as a victim of Mexico, a country that supposedly steals jobs, imposes onerous treaties and sends its \u201cbad hombres\u201d across the border.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;To confront this fake history, some Mexicans are proposing to remind Mr. Trump exactly what country was the first victim of American imperialism. They are calling for a lawsuit that would aim to nullify the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo (signed on Feb. 2, 1848), in which Mexico \u2014 invaded by American soldiers, its capital occupied, its ports and customs stations seized \u2014 was forced to accept the American annexation of Texas and concede more than half the rest of Mexican territory, now including most of the states of Arizona, New Mexico and California.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The United States owes Mexico and itself an honest reconsideration of its first imperial war, not only in its schools and universities but also in its museums and books. Hollywood and Broadway, which have always played an important role in shaping the American historical consciousness, should take up the issue.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Films, documentaries and memorable TV series have helped to modify the memory of two original sins, slavery and racism against African-Americans, and, with somewhat lesser attention perhaps, the racist slaughter and repression of the American Indians. A third sin should be added to these: the aggression against Mexico and the plundering of its territory.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;But the best and most just reparation would be American immigration reform that could open the road to citizenship for the descendants of those Mexicans who suffered the unjust loss of half their territory.<\/span>","filename":"07krauze-master768","ext":".jpg","w":768,"h":432,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1491638046360,"time":1491638046,"md5":"p7PvNbqxGrnYIfIhMyTh\/w==","fsize":92869,"resto":0,"id":"Yn0\/XfYR","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"will-mexico-get-half-of-its-territory-back","country_name":"Canada","replies":1,"images":1,"unique_ips":2},{"no":120105902,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)03:56:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mexicans<\/span>","filename":"1463533758368","ext":".jpg","w":1010,"h":948,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":117,"tim":1491638163584,"time":1491638163,"md5":"QX8KnMTsJdSedBSAPAjf3A==","fsize":139949,"resto":120105782,"id":"wa\/oo+sQ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

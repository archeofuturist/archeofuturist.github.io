It&#039;s the cost of implementing it that is psychopathic. I thought I made it clear.<br>Socialists do not have to advance their ideology beyond a single nation, strictly speaking. But the desire to liberate the oppressed makes them yearn to. People who don&#039;t know better, and need to be freed from their willing slavery. Marx was all about this, as is every revolutionary. But even so, they do need to advance their ideology to establish a new nation - on Earth, at least. Unless you can persuade a population (difficult because people are apathetic) then you need to use force.

If we could just kill the super rich puppet masters, the economy and people&#039;s way of life would be preserved.<br>That&#039;s the only solution I can think of. It still involves killing. The distinction is that this is targeting a small group of clearly defined people done for practical concerns as a matter of survival, rather than chasing a dream. It can&#039;t be a government affair, it has to be civilian, because to have government sanctioned kill squads for use whenever would give the government too much power, and frankly undermine faith in the state probably to the point of the destruction of the economy and everything you&#039;d be trying to protect.<br>I&#039;m sorry man, I appreciate you doing a 180 and actually trying to have a discussion.

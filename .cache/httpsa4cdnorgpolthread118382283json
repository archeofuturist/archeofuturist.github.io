This places a great burden on their aging parents, who must manage the household, while their children live life on easy mode, turning their nose up at anything other than the perfect job because their parents are providing them with food and shelter so they don&#039;t need an income. (Sure, they&#039;ll complain about having no money, but only because it means they can&#039;t go out drinking with their mates or going on vacation abroad all the time.)<br><br>I left home to go to college in 2006, and I never moved back. I graduated in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, yet I managed to find a job that paid enough for me to live independently. Sure, the apartment I rented wasn&#039;t great, but it served me well enough. I had a shitty, crowded commute for years, but I put up with it. I kept working hard, progressing in my career, and now I&#039;m in a very comfortable position.<br><br>The people who moved back home to live with their parents? Not so much. They&#039;re still nowhere near independence. I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if they never bother doing anything, knowing that eventually they&#039;ll inherit their parents&#039; house.<br><br>Can we fix this?

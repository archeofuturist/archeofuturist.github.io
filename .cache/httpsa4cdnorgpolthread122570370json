No other popular religions execute apostates. Therefore islam will spread the fastest.<br><br>Terrorism will be used to put pro muslim laws into effect. The government can only defend against so many attacks before it starts to give in to demands. <br><br>\u201cBut the government will just put soldiers on every street and increase our anti terrorism facilities\u201d. Sure but at what cost. Create enough fear and our countries will soon be bankrupting themselves fighting a guerilla war within their own country for the forseeable future. Think how much money our governments and businesses use each time a lone terrorist goes on a rampage. It must be in the hundreds of thousands, maybe even millions<br><br>The only way to stop the rise of islam would be.<br><br>1. outbreed them (unlikely as islam is growing at a far greater rate than christianity)<br>2. Make the punishments for leaving other religions such as christianity death as well, so it keeps the numbers up.<br><br>So stop complaining about invading muslims, and accept it. It&#039;s the future.","filename":"hdfhdfh","ext":".jpg","w":345,"h":356,"tn_w":242,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493028868820,"time":1493028868,"md5":"PRAS0bqX9QYwvK0brzQ1CA==","fsize":23357,"resto":0,"id":"we1yR0gO","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"islam-will-win-the-fight-for-the-west","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

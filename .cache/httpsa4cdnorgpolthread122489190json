If you choose to label yourself with a gender, it only shows how shallow you are as you&#039;re attempting to take advantage of a culture obsessed with identities to bring attention to yourself.","time":1492985936,"resto":122489190,"id":"HOO6vOfV","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122498192,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)18:19:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"Bill Nye ain&#039;t a scientist, he&#039;s just some old ass tv actor who hosted a kid&#039;s show with a really catchy intro song.
